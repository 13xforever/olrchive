WEBVTT

00:13.920 --> 00:22.589
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, June 13th, 2010, the E3 News Barrage begins and we connect with our listeners to get all your feedback on the early news.

00:31.926 --> 00:34.147
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers I'm not sick anymore

00:59.635 --> 01:03.838
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're going to sound it on the radio, though, because you have your voice thing going on.

01:04.219 --> 01:10.503
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is I had a viral infection and it coughed my throat, well, bloody.

01:11.204 --> 01:11.604
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross.

01:13.386 --> 01:17.248
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually not supposed to use my voice much until the 21st.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.699
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's role in tonight's show will be scaled back just a little bit.

01:21.759 --> 01:22.780
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a little.

01:23.060 --> 01:26.142
[SPEAKER_14]: But she'll still be here to provide her always insightful commentary.

01:26.583 --> 01:26.943
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

01:27.103 --> 01:28.945
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got some snark.

01:29.925 --> 01:32.588
[SPEAKER_14]: Being sick makes a person a little extra snarky, I find.

01:33.208 --> 01:34.309
[SPEAKER_14]: I am also a little sick.

01:34.729 --> 01:36.351
[SPEAKER_14]: Just now the E3 is coming up.

01:36.571 --> 01:42.776
[SPEAKER_14]: I have this gift, I don't know what you want to call it, where I tend to get sick at big gaming conventions.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.638
[SPEAKER_14]: It happened at PAX East earlier this year and now it's happening again for E3.

01:46.539 --> 01:46.979
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray.

01:47.620 --> 01:52.023
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, also joining us tonight, say hello to the well and healthy, at least for now, Tech Master Loki.

01:52.443 --> 01:54.925
[SPEAKER_11]: I am perfectly fine, except in my head.

01:55.405 --> 01:56.265
[SPEAKER_11]: I am sick in the head.

01:56.566 --> 02:01.709
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's why we love you here on Orange Lounge Radio, Loki, which we're coming up on, if you can believe it, our eighth episode.

02:02.009 --> 02:04.731
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to the one and only Miklatov is here tonight

02:29.949 --> 02:31.550
[SPEAKER_14]: Video Game Company to a Video Game Store

02:49.258 --> 02:51.480
[SPEAKER_14]: And for those who don't know, you used to work for... Konami.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.001
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and can you say what you did at Konami, or was that a secret?

02:54.061 --> 03:04.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did DDR, and I made the steps, and with, you know, the other people on the team, and I did text stuff, and yeah, that's what I did there.

03:04.629 --> 03:05.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got drunk.

03:08.431 --> 03:09.152
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was fun.

03:09.502 --> 03:09.782
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura,

03:21.524 --> 03:22.065
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

03:22.485 --> 03:22.765
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

03:23.005 --> 03:23.546
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

03:24.066 --> 03:24.507
[SPEAKER_14]: So what happened?

03:24.607 --> 03:25.547
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you allowed to talk about what happened?

03:25.567 --> 03:26.148
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

03:26.168 --> 03:27.129
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Supernova.

03:27.229 --> 03:28.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Supernova was really good.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.510
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you allowed to talk about what happened?

03:29.571 --> 03:30.912
[SPEAKER_14]: Why you no longer at Konami?

03:31.112 --> 03:31.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

03:32.273 --> 03:37.797
[SPEAKER_04]: They just moved and I didn't want to move because I didn't have a permanent quote unquote position.

03:37.937 --> 03:41.860
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wasn't going to get paid to move down to where they moved their offices to.

03:41.980 --> 03:44.962
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided time to leave.

03:45.723 --> 03:47.684
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you went back to where your family is, correct?

03:47.705 --> 03:47.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

03:48.485 --> 03:49.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is in the Midwest.

03:49.926 --> 03:50.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

03:50.246 --> 03:50.467
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

03:51.127 --> 03:51.487
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

03:51.787 --> 03:52.287
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

03:52.668 --> 03:54.128
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, but things are good for you in Kansas.

03:54.148 --> 03:54.868
[SPEAKER_14]: Kansas treating you well?

03:55.028 --> 03:55.789
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good enough.

03:56.149 --> 03:57.229
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, welcome back to the show.

03:57.309 --> 03:59.610
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure you haven't listened since the last time you've been on.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for the past three weeks.

04:01.071 --> 04:01.711
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right.

04:01.731 --> 04:03.251
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been commenting in chat and stuff.

04:03.432 --> 04:03.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

04:03.712 --> 04:07.273
[SPEAKER_14]: The show's kind of different now than it was when you were first coming onto the show, huh?

04:07.293 --> 04:13.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not so much about the music games anymore, but there aren't very many great music games anymore, so it's okay.

04:13.835 --> 04:14.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

04:14.716 --> 04:18.617
[SPEAKER_14]: For our new listeners, real quick, can you kind of define, what did Orange Lounge Radio use?

04:18.757 --> 04:19.357
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much it.

04:19.377 --> 04:19.637
[SPEAKER_14]: You got it.

04:34.083 --> 04:49.409
[SPEAKER_14]: E3 is coming up and we're going to talk a lot about E3 tonight with Miklatov And speaking of which, we have big, big news coming out of the big cities tonight We're going to start off the show a little differently tonight We have an Orange Lounge Radio special report

04:59.008 --> 05:01.711
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, we do have some big breaking news.

05:01.831 --> 05:10.058
[SPEAKER_14]: It does appear that Scarlett Johansson has won the Tony for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play for A View from the Bridge.

05:10.098 --> 05:13.762
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to Scarlett Johansson, you hot bitch.

05:13.902 --> 05:17.245
[SPEAKER_14]: We all, okay, E3, yeah, no, there's some huge news coming out of E3.

05:17.765 --> 05:22.850
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously tonight is Microsoft's big reveal of Project Natal.

05:23.210 --> 05:24.832
[SPEAKER_11]: Not necessarily the press conference.

05:24.992 --> 05:38.660
[SPEAKER_14]: and yes, it's not their press conference but it's their Cirque du Soleil as imagined by Cirque du Soleil or as one of my friends calls it Cirque du Sogay as the Project Natal is being reinvented or reimagined or whatever they're doing.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.241
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how Patton Oswalt describes it.

05:40.321 --> 05:41.242
[SPEAKER_14]: What does he describe it as?

05:43.423 --> 05:44.423
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much what it is.

06:00.050 --> 06:00.731
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance Central Dance Central

06:28.829 --> 06:32.092
[SPEAKER_14]: and USA Today is calling it a So You Think You Can Dance experience home.

06:32.132 --> 06:35.255
[SPEAKER_14]: Although it's not for sure if the brand name actually plays into it.

06:35.315 --> 06:36.175
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not.

06:36.516 --> 06:42.861
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want to tie in directly to last week's show, there's your Timberland Cascada game and all those things we were talking about.

06:42.901 --> 06:44.422
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I say Timberland like a tree?

06:44.502 --> 06:49.046
[SPEAKER_14]: Timberland and Cascada and all those things we were talking about last week.

06:49.066 --> 06:50.067
[SPEAKER_14]: That's got to be it.

06:50.107 --> 06:50.588
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

06:50.788 --> 06:52.709
[SPEAKER_14]: Timber... Whatever.

06:53.550 --> 06:54.051
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Vomitarium

07:10.965 --> 07:40.385
[SPEAKER_14]: The Vomitarium, that might be in Kinect Adventures River Raft Time Trial, Obstacle Course up to four players on the raft playing as a duo, you and a partner lean one way or another to steer also a game called Joyride which was originally announced a little while ago got pulled from Xbox.com and then came back, it's a racing game that's the one where you're going to hold the imaginary steering wheel and drive back and forth Connectimals, you train and play 20 different virtual cats

07:40.965 --> 07:42.826
[SPEAKER_14]: including a lion, a cheetah, and a tiger.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.327
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like Pokecats, but with Kinect.

07:46.527 --> 07:47.528
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what else to call that.

07:47.908 --> 07:58.232
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly, and this is pretty big, Star Wars characters and Disney favorites will be featured in separate new games being developed at Microsoft in conjunction with LucasArts and Disney.

07:58.633 --> 08:02.574
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know that whole Wii lightsaber game y'all been wanting for years and years?

08:02.654 --> 08:03.155
[SPEAKER_14]: Guess what?

08:03.295 --> 08:04.255
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft announced this

08:04.295 --> 08:06.037
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what you think of the name?

08:32.855 --> 08:33.796
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

08:52.219 --> 08:53.781
[SPEAKER_02]: I played with K'nex when I was a kid.

08:55.843 --> 08:57.385
[SPEAKER_14]: I played K'nex 4 when I was a kid.

08:59.327 --> 09:00.608
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov, what do you think of K'nex?

09:00.748 --> 09:01.289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dumb.

09:01.910 --> 09:02.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you say it's dumb?

09:02.951 --> 09:03.431
[SPEAKER_04]: Because.

09:04.813 --> 09:05.634
[SPEAKER_04]: We know Natal.

09:06.094 --> 09:09.118
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds kind of cool, futuristic, what they're kind of going for.

09:09.538 --> 09:09.838
[SPEAKER_04]: K'nex.

09:09.858 --> 09:09.979
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

09:10.879 --> 09:11.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.

09:11.440 --> 09:17.362
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but see, remember, we all love the revolution, and, you know... And the Wii is still a stupid name.

09:17.542 --> 09:19.043
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not gonna say it's not.

09:19.263 --> 09:20.243
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to the chatters.

09:20.343 --> 09:23.344
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com, after all... It's just a name!

09:23.444 --> 09:24.745
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the place where every gamer has a voice.

09:25.305 --> 09:29.947
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, SJ100Matt, you know we said the same thing when they came out with the Nintendo Revolution before the Wii.

09:31.503 --> 09:38.047
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that they're coming out with this wonderful system and they're totally mimicking everything that's on the Wii already.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.327
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's see.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.028
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a game that's like Wii Sports.

09:41.088 --> 09:43.790
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a game that's probably going to be like Wii Play.

09:44.610 --> 09:46.631
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got a game that's just like Just Dance.

09:47.052 --> 09:53.015
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and we've got a game with Disney characters and Star Wars characters that will probably be very similar to what's already on the Wii, just with slightly better graphics.

09:53.195 --> 09:54.956
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and we have a racing game with a fake wheel.

09:56.976 --> 10:02.179
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really, are we going to have the same shit on this stupid console?

10:03.139 --> 10:07.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I really going to pay the mythical $150 for this thing?

10:09.242 --> 10:14.244
[SPEAKER_11]: Fool me once, Microsoft, I already bought your fucking camera, and it served me no purpose whatsoever.

10:14.464 --> 10:16.345
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but you did get to use your picture as an icon.

10:17.286 --> 10:18.086
[SPEAKER_14]: Or a gamer pic.

10:19.767 --> 10:20.527
[SPEAKER_14]: And Burnout.

10:20.607 --> 10:21.347
[SPEAKER_14]: The Burnout game.

10:21.768 --> 10:22.088
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember?

10:23.448 --> 10:23.729
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

10:23.749 --> 10:32.857
[SPEAKER_14]: It took pictures of you when your car crashed, so you get pictures sent to strangers on the internet where it looks like you're taking a poop because you have these urgh faces.

10:34.679 --> 10:38.022
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more chat or comments, because boy, they're being eloquent tonight.

10:38.522 --> 10:49.832
[SPEAKER_14]: Bochikawa in our chatroom, chat.orangehawnsradio.com, by the way, if you want to join us here live on this Sunday night, as we tape at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

10:50.132 --> 10:54.556
[SPEAKER_14]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says, connect just won't connect to the consumer.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.918
[SPEAKER_11]: This is basically their grab for the Wii Market.

11:00.439 --> 11:07.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Problem is, people in the Wii Market have a Wii, and they're not going to buy another console to play the same fucking games.

11:09.665 --> 11:10.406
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy everything.

11:11.006 --> 11:12.667
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw in our chat, you're special.

11:13.048 --> 11:17.111
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw in our chat says one of the other games will probably be Connect the Dots.

11:18.001 --> 11:20.822
[SPEAKER_14]: BaconBit says the name doesn't matter as long as it's fun.

11:21.662 --> 11:25.664
[SPEAKER_14]: And BauerCTU says I'll call it shit, not connect.

11:26.084 --> 11:27.024
[SPEAKER_14]: How about ka-shit?

11:27.164 --> 11:29.165
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we compromise here, Bauer?

11:29.325 --> 11:30.866
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be alright, but the problem...

11:32.116 --> 11:32.616
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

11:51.226 --> 11:52.447
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:12.904 --> 12:29.481
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see more stuff in chat I love this Salacious Pop in chat says When I hear and say Natal I think Xbox Motion Accessory But whenever I see Microsoft NATAL in print Or Microsoft Natal in print I think of ultrasounds, folic acid vitamins And diaper genies

12:32.548 --> 12:36.191
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerCloud says watch, they will have cheesy taglines like connect to the web.

12:36.211 --> 12:38.813
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have just called it the kinetic.

12:39.614 --> 12:41.315
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because that would have been kind of neat.

12:41.936 --> 12:45.098
[SPEAKER_11]: It would have at least sounded kind of fancy and stuff.

12:45.218 --> 12:51.043
[SPEAKER_11]: And I give them points, they're like one step above move, because move is just like, oh, what should we call this?

12:51.063 --> 12:52.704
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it's a control you move around with.

12:52.824 --> 12:54.105
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, move, good, done.

12:54.486 --> 12:55.887
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't even think about a name.

12:56.187 --> 13:01.991
[SPEAKER_14]: Techness in our chat says they might as well have named it Connect 3D since 3D is the new marketing term and the tech that it's based on.

13:02.572 --> 13:05.834
[SPEAKER_14]: SSJ100Matt says the real question is do they announce an Eye of Judgment game?

13:05.954 --> 13:07.215
[SPEAKER_14]: If so, do we care to make a bet on it?

13:09.197 --> 13:10.017
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see.

13:10.318 --> 13:12.559
[SPEAKER_14]: Lastly, where were we at?

13:12.619 --> 13:15.802
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, SSJ100Matt says Connect starring Jodie Foster.

13:15.942 --> 13:17.303
[SPEAKER_14]: Spoiler alert, it's her father.

13:19.958 --> 13:21.379
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:43.067 --> 13:50.552
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into a little bit of the normal flow of our show, but we thought we'd interrupt there for the breaking Xbox news.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.855
[SPEAKER_14]: We will keep you posted if anything else breaks during the conference.

13:53.875 --> 13:56.096
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if we think of any other funny connect jokes.

13:56.197 --> 13:59.219
[SPEAKER_14]: Special events featuring Cirque de French Gay.

13:59.699 --> 14:01.360
[SPEAKER_14]: Star Trek Online, I Hit Commander, Finally

14:27.031 --> 14:31.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, um, I made a friend in Scotland.

14:31.514 --> 14:31.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?

14:32.235 --> 14:32.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

14:32.835 --> 14:34.056
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's not Scottish, it's crap.

14:35.437 --> 14:35.778
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.

14:36.618 --> 14:43.544
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, I, uh, I've been playing Sims 3 like I'm doing right now.

14:43.564 --> 14:45.745
[SPEAKER_02]: During the show.

14:45.765 --> 14:46.246
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slow.

14:46.506 --> 14:46.906
[SPEAKER_02]: During the show.

14:46.946 --> 14:47.927
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what else is new?

14:48.027 --> 14:49.328
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's, I know, I know.

14:49.508 --> 14:52.109
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you not playing Star Trek Online during the show and eating bandwidth.

14:52.189 --> 14:52.550
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.371
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned off Steam for the show, Rob.

14:54.611 --> 14:55.491
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very happy you did that.

14:55.511 --> 14:58.013
[SPEAKER_02]: I was enamored with watching everyone's Steam updates.

14:59.093 --> 15:00.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I played some Portal.

15:02.515 --> 15:03.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since I got it free.

15:05.216 --> 15:05.777
[SPEAKER_14]: Free is good.

15:06.477 --> 15:07.177
[SPEAKER_14]: Free is very good.

15:08.598 --> 15:09.038
[SPEAKER_14]: Alrighty.

15:09.759 --> 15:10.639
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move on to Loki.

15:10.659 --> 15:13.021
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

15:13.521 --> 15:14.902
[SPEAKER_11]: Same old stuff again.

15:15.502 --> 15:16.242
[SPEAKER_11]: Grand Theft Auto.

15:16.843 --> 15:17.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Mainly

15:19.606 --> 15:27.870
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been playing just the regular deathmatch stuff, but we have been having some really serious connection problems thanks to our wonderful bandwidth at work.

15:28.871 --> 15:30.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Dead Redemption, more co-op than that.

15:30.952 --> 15:32.873
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm like level 20-something now, like 23.

15:34.274 --> 15:43.338
[SPEAKER_11]: And Earth Defense Force, we're most of the way through the Inferno difficulty, and it's major fun.

15:45.880 --> 15:46.220
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

15:47.240 --> 15:47.500
[SPEAKER_11]: That's...

15:48.721 --> 15:49.382
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much it.

15:49.582 --> 15:59.450
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been mainly painting baby room and working on Grand Theft Auto 4 editing.

16:00.030 --> 16:02.312
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Imagine Babies in real life, basically.

16:02.984 --> 16:04.425
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's game related.

16:04.725 --> 16:05.946
[SPEAKER_11]: The room is New Super Mario.

16:05.986 --> 16:09.668
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, and I don't know if the pictures are public or whatever, but they're really cute.

16:09.748 --> 16:12.910
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a lot of the stuff that you and the wife are doing are really cute.

16:13.711 --> 16:22.776
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we got big old stuffed animals of Koopas and, you know, the star and the fire flower and stuff like that.

16:22.816 --> 16:30.921
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, we have wall decals for the New Super Mario Brothers characters and the bricks and question blocks and all that fun stuff.

16:31.317 --> 16:32.918
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:59.825 --> 17:04.712
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was the best one though and it made me sad and I hate the people at Roseville Golf Line because they're idiots.

17:05.093 --> 17:06.535
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they listen and know that they're dumb.

17:07.446 --> 17:13.691
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved it too because when Miklatov was kind of getting off the plane and he met Alan, we went out to lunch when he first got here.

17:13.911 --> 17:17.935
[SPEAKER_14]: Because what's the first thing anyone wants to do when they come to California?

17:17.955 --> 17:18.796
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, let's go eat.

17:19.036 --> 17:20.277
[SPEAKER_14]: And Miklatov wanted to go too?

17:20.497 --> 17:21.037
[SPEAKER_04]: In-N-Out.

17:21.097 --> 17:21.378
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

17:21.438 --> 17:27.623
[SPEAKER_14]: So we went to In-N-Out and we were eating and Miklatov was like, I didn't come here for E3.

17:27.663 --> 17:29.104
[SPEAKER_14]: I came here to play DJ Max Technica.

17:29.164 --> 17:29.605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

17:29.985 --> 17:34.869
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we went to Roseville Golf Line last night and I looked and the machine was broken, I couldn't help but laugh.

17:35.249 --> 17:36.190
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny.

17:36.290 --> 17:38.552
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really depressing moment in my life.

17:38.592 --> 17:44.198
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sad, but... And then the people would not sell me Technica cards, which they had.

17:44.478 --> 17:46.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go up there three times to get them.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, the guy just said, okay.

17:49.182 --> 17:51.444
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, you know, these don't work because the machine doesn't work.

17:51.464 --> 17:55.288
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I understand that, but I'm giving you money to give me these cards.

17:56.069 --> 17:57.270
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did.

17:58.170 --> 18:00.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate 16-year-olds that work at arcades.

18:01.673 --> 18:04.435
[SPEAKER_11]: Arcade Infinity is still open and couldn't you guys go there?

18:05.336 --> 18:06.456
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a backup plan.

18:06.476 --> 18:07.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and yes.

18:07.777 --> 18:12.600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to call them and be like so do you have a working Technica machine?

18:12.860 --> 18:14.521
[SPEAKER_04]: Because other places don't.

18:14.941 --> 18:15.381
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

18:15.902 --> 18:18.023
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was also an idea we could go to Sunnyvale Golf Land.

18:18.043 --> 18:19.664
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't think we can make it work with the timing.

18:19.884 --> 18:21.845
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have a family thing Saturday I have to go to.

18:22.429 --> 18:27.733
[SPEAKER_04]: and Sunnyville has Sirius too which would be fun to play but maybe Arcade Infinity might as well since they used to be up on that stuff.

18:28.053 --> 18:28.433
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

18:28.593 --> 18:29.053
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

18:30.034 --> 18:30.334
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

18:30.454 --> 18:32.516
[SPEAKER_11]: Aren't they like almost closing now or something?

18:32.536 --> 18:34.217
[SPEAKER_11]: Aren't they like one of those save the arcades?

18:34.297 --> 18:36.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

18:36.438 --> 18:36.779
[SPEAKER_14]: Sadly.

18:37.059 --> 18:40.701
[SPEAKER_14]: Sherzo in chat says Rob, I was there when he was there Friday night.

18:40.781 --> 18:42.162
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov was at RVGL.

18:42.282 --> 18:42.763
[SPEAKER_14]: I met him.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.085
[SPEAKER_14]: Well that's amazing because he was still in Kansas Friday night.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.867
[SPEAKER_14]: We both went on Saturday actually.

18:48.887 --> 18:49.827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cool.

18:49.907 --> 18:52.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was me from the future but in the past.

18:53.570 --> 18:54.751
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless he's getting his days mixed up.

18:54.771 --> 18:58.134
[SPEAKER_14]: He could have been that guy because there was a guy playing Beatmania 2DX who was pretty good.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.436
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Miklasov too.

19:00.837 --> 19:01.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

19:02.598 --> 19:04.680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a first in a couple years.

19:06.442 --> 19:07.963
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else you played this week you want to mention?

19:08.363 --> 19:29.294
[SPEAKER_04]: um oh on the plane I was playing DJ Max because it's like the only game I play anymore and this old lady was sitting like two seats next to me away from me because we had an empty seat in the middle she kept watching me play it and it was really creepy because she was like really old like 60 or 70 and then she's talked to me I was like whatever I just want to play my game

19:31.328 --> 19:34.390
[SPEAKER_04]: But she enjoyed DJ Max kind of over your shoulder?

19:34.410 --> 19:37.612
[SPEAKER_04]: Or being a creepy stalkery, I don't know.

19:37.692 --> 19:38.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Old lady?

19:38.472 --> 19:39.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I said.

19:39.773 --> 19:40.373
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there you go.

19:40.733 --> 19:41.134
[SPEAKER_04]: Creepy.

19:41.174 --> 19:43.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have your first encounter with a cougar?

19:45.336 --> 19:46.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Come here, little boy.

19:46.176 --> 19:47.057
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some candy.

19:47.117 --> 19:48.037
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that is gross.

19:49.249 --> 19:50.750
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, my gaming week.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.752
[SPEAKER_14]: Not quite as interesting as anyone else's.

19:52.852 --> 19:58.716
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I did go to Golfland with Miglatov last night and point laughed when the machine was down.

19:58.776 --> 19:59.396
[SPEAKER_14]: Although not really.

19:59.456 --> 20:00.677
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually thought that was kind of crap.

20:00.697 --> 20:01.478
[SPEAKER_14]: You did laugh though.

20:01.898 --> 20:05.941
[SPEAKER_14]: I did laugh, but it was one of those like, that fucking sucks laugh.

20:06.021 --> 20:06.482
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know.

20:07.622 --> 20:10.424
[SPEAKER_14]: But I played Beatmania, what is it they have there?

20:10.564 --> 20:11.965
[SPEAKER_14]: Distorted.

20:12.065 --> 20:12.786
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that 13, 14?

20:13.026 --> 20:13.386
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 13.

20:13.446 --> 20:13.786
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

20:14.206 --> 20:15.367
[SPEAKER_14]: When the music stopped getting good.

20:16.288 --> 20:16.728
[SPEAKER_14]: Some teen.

20:17.048 --> 20:17.629
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, some teen.

20:18.309 --> 20:19.850
[SPEAKER_14]: But I played a bunch of old songs.

20:20.150 --> 20:23.132
[SPEAKER_14]: I can surprisingly still pass level 7 and 8 songs.

20:23.252 --> 20:24.593
[SPEAKER_14]: I beat Daisuke, I was all like, woo!

20:25.660 --> 20:27.121
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened to you playing Final Fantasy XIII?

20:50.715 --> 20:51.335
[SPEAKER_14]: DoctorStrangePork

21:12.324 --> 21:13.945
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a mouse with a long tongue.

21:33.042 --> 21:46.128
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright And that was pretty much my gaming week Not a lot of exciting stuff outside of that But BlackWolf in chat says Oink is awesome, you all stop making fun of Oink right now I love Oink It's Miklatov that is the hater

21:47.591 --> 21:48.332
[SPEAKER_14]: Haters to the left

22:06.912 --> 22:07.452
[SPEAKER_14]: Housekeeping First

22:38.559 --> 22:39.259
[SPEAKER_14]: E3 Overload

22:59.677 --> 23:02.619
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob Roberts and pals will bring you some specials to the feed.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.081
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, Miklatov, one of my pals, will be there every night.

23:05.401 --> 23:10.225
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping that Bobby Blackwolf and whatever other pals I find in LA will also be there.

23:10.265 --> 23:11.966
[SPEAKER_14]: So there'll be lots of feed updates this week.

23:12.026 --> 23:19.211
[SPEAKER_14]: So make sure you are subscribed to our feed in iTunes or whatever your favorite little podcatcher program is so you don't miss anything.

23:19.631 --> 23:21.553
[SPEAKER_14]: This is also very important during housekeeping.

23:22.114 --> 23:30.622
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a bad feeling this is going to get forgotten a little bit amongst all the E3 hype that's going on right now, but I do want to mention we talked about this a little bit last week, but it is official.

23:31.243 --> 23:35.067
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio and our listenership will be participating in the All Games Big Battle.

23:35.447 --> 23:36.008
[SPEAKER_14]: BigBattle.com

23:53.828 --> 23:55.769
[SPEAKER_14]: I know one of them was Pinball.

23:56.089 --> 23:57.470
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the recently announced ones.

23:57.510 --> 24:09.554
[SPEAKER_14]: Those were just announced a little earlier this week where you can actually play either Zen Pinball on the PS3 or the Pinball FX on the 360.

24:10.755 --> 24:12.135
[SPEAKER_14]: Those games will be a part of this.

24:12.495 --> 24:14.856
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Soldner X2, there's competition for that.

24:15.416 --> 24:20.078
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is going to be a live competition on June 26th, Battlefield Bad Company 2.

24:20.398 --> 24:21.379
[SPEAKER_14]: All that information is at...

24:22.099 --> 24:30.565
[SPEAKER_14]: BigBattle.AllGames.com We will bring you a little more information on that this next week after E3 settles down a little bit.

24:30.605 --> 24:35.188
[SPEAKER_14]: The first competition I believe ends is the Soldner X21 and it ends on the 26th.

24:35.228 --> 24:36.068
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a little time.

24:36.389 --> 24:39.090
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want to get the jump on these competitions, go check it out.

24:39.130 --> 24:40.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially the pinball ones.

24:40.251 --> 24:42.132
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have some listeners that are good at pinball.

24:42.373 --> 24:48.997
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no reason that Orange Lounge Radio should not destroy all of the other shows participating in at least pinball.

24:49.097 --> 24:50.118
[SPEAKER_14]: And pinball is two.

24:50.158 --> 24:50.538
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two.

24:50.638 --> 24:51.959
[SPEAKER_14]: There's pinball FX and pinball.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.804
[SPEAKER_14]: So we should have at least half these competitions right out the gate.

24:54.824 --> 24:57.049
[SPEAKER_11]: They got me excited there because I was reading this all of a sudden.

24:57.109 --> 24:59.694
[SPEAKER_11]: It said, for PS3s and pinballs, Earth Defense Force.

24:59.714 --> 25:01.017
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, ooh, Earth Defense Force!

25:01.519 --> 25:02.320
[SPEAKER_11]: I will win at that!

25:02.960 --> 25:03.481
[SPEAKER_11]: But no.

25:04.161 --> 25:05.422
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, it's not.

25:05.703 --> 25:09.305
[SPEAKER_14]: I am trying to get Derek to put Grand Theft Auto 4 as one of the games.

25:10.126 --> 25:10.587
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll see.

25:10.687 --> 25:11.527
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be kind of tough.

25:12.048 --> 25:14.330
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has to be Episodes of Liberty City because that's a better game.

25:14.790 --> 25:15.471
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see, we'll see.

25:15.911 --> 25:17.752
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we'll talk more about that next week.

25:18.673 --> 25:24.298
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to belittle the importance of the event, but just with E3 going on, I just think everybody's going to forget.

25:24.378 --> 25:30.303
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to get kind of lost amongst all the E3 madness, but we will be kind of giving you regular updates on what's going on there.

25:30.704 --> 25:35.979
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting next week So again, sign up now, get the jump on everything Read all about it, bigbattle.allgames.com

25:37.434 --> 25:40.275
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see what else is going on right now that I want to tell you guys about.

25:40.555 --> 25:43.857
[SPEAKER_14]: The anniversary show for Orange Lounge Radio is coming up in two weeks.

25:44.277 --> 25:45.697
[SPEAKER_14]: So next Sunday we will be live.

25:45.737 --> 25:46.798
[SPEAKER_14]: It's our post E3 show.

25:47.158 --> 25:54.101
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we will be here for the anniversary show of Orange Lounge Radio which will be on the 14 days from tonight.

25:54.121 --> 25:55.021
[SPEAKER_14]: So the 27th.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.322
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after that is July 4th.

25:57.402 --> 26:01.323
[SPEAKER_14]: We will not be live on July 4th due to the holiday.

26:02.304 --> 26:04.845
[SPEAKER_14]: People want to go set things on fire instead of sitting here on the radio.

26:05.965 --> 26:06.705
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget Geek Life

26:32.867 --> 26:35.428
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura is going to start us off tonight with some gaming news.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.149
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, DarkSakura?

26:55.990 --> 26:57.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero.

26:58.050 --> 26:58.871
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Rock Band 3.

26:58.911 --> 27:03.512
[SPEAKER_02]: The keytar is official for Rock Band 3.

27:04.212 --> 27:09.953
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be either something you can play as a horizontal keyboard or over the shoulder.

27:10.053 --> 27:13.894
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this little handle, very keytar-like.

27:14.694 --> 27:17.135
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a two-octave keyboard.

27:17.175 --> 27:19.315
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very Keyboard Mania-like.

27:19.496 --> 27:20.116
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 keys, I think.

27:20.296 --> 27:21.116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, two-octave.

27:21.936 --> 27:23.417
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, it's not a keytar.

27:23.537 --> 27:24.998
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, yay, yay.

27:25.038 --> 27:28.760
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you could stand it upright and it could be a guitar, but it's an actual bona fide keyboard.

27:28.860 --> 27:29.960
[SPEAKER_14]: I love you, Harmonix.

27:31.981 --> 27:35.063
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's that and the hyper guitar.

27:36.103 --> 27:37.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that thing?

27:38.285 --> 27:39.045
[SPEAKER_02]: The hyper guitar.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.866
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that like the 120 button one?

27:41.006 --> 27:42.627
[SPEAKER_14]: The 120 fret with strings.

27:42.867 --> 27:44.748
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now they want to teach you how to really play.

27:45.971 --> 27:47.111
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of want it.

27:47.212 --> 27:47.692
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

27:47.812 --> 27:51.893
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't care about any of it because keyboards and Bohemian Rhapsody.

27:51.953 --> 28:00.956
[SPEAKER_14]: And the cool thing is if you play in pro mode and you play the expert level and if you can memorize what you're doing, you will be able to play the actual real song.

28:01.116 --> 28:02.077
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the great thing about this.

28:03.197 --> 28:03.377
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

28:04.217 --> 28:11.621
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that I thought was a little weird was when you look at the video, the pro mode note chart kind of scrolls to the right and to the left.

28:11.661 --> 28:13.261
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't see it all on the screen at once.

28:13.421 --> 28:14.682
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's actually kind of cool.

28:14.962 --> 28:17.823
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's supposed to tell you when to move your hands around.

28:18.143 --> 28:21.965
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's what the point is, but I'm a little apprehensive about it.

28:22.125 --> 28:27.750
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's limited screen space, basically, because you can't have 25 rows on there at one time.

28:28.290 --> 28:33.274
[SPEAKER_11]: So what they do is, as the song shifts octaves or whatever, it will scroll over.

28:34.535 --> 28:36.277
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is fine by me, it looks pretty awesome.

28:36.357 --> 28:40.180
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering how they'd be able to pull it off, and it looks like you can do it.

28:40.300 --> 28:46.565
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what I want to see is how the hell they're going to do the guitar part of the pro mode, because that's going to be weird.

28:48.467 --> 28:51.068
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Tiger Claw is in our chat right now and he said the same thing.

28:51.108 --> 28:55.051
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just thinking, Sky, it's an actual keyboard you can plug into your computer and use as a MIDI keyboard.

28:55.151 --> 28:58.113
[SPEAKER_14]: That just makes it like 10 times more awesome.

28:58.313 --> 28:59.054
[SPEAKER_14]: More awesomer.

28:59.494 --> 29:08.960
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can actually get a MIDI adapter to plug into any MIDI guitars, drums, or keyboards that you may have as well and use those in Rock Band.

29:10.541 --> 29:13.463
[SPEAKER_14]: So what do you guys think of Rock Band 3 so far from this news we're hearing?

29:13.854 --> 29:29.081
[SPEAKER_14]: Guitar Hero I am so excited Bohemian Rhapsody and Power of Love There were some other songs they announced too I don't have the whole list in front of me but it looks like it's going to be a pretty solid list lots of newer stuff but some of the old stuff too for fun

29:30.606 --> 29:31.987
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to get to our next news story.

29:32.027 --> 29:34.629
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, guys, I can't control tonight.

29:34.649 --> 29:36.410
[SPEAKER_14]: There is just so much breaking news.

29:46.598 --> 29:48.220
[SPEAKER_14]: The Tony for best mute.

29:48.240 --> 29:48.680
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

29:49.020 --> 29:51.182
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, we're going to go to Miklatov with a special report.

29:51.976 --> 29:56.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently those rumors about a new 360 appear true.

29:58.061 --> 30:13.513
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they are redesigning the 360, and it will come with a 250 gigabyte hard drive, but most importantly, built-in Wi-Fi, so you don't have to pay $100 to be able to connect to the internet if you don't have a very long ethernet cable.

30:13.953 --> 30:16.555
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes with a fork and a knife and a clock and a pillow.

30:17.911 --> 30:19.412
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be great, actually.

30:19.832 --> 30:20.893
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you could sleep on your 360.

30:21.773 --> 30:22.894
[SPEAKER_14]: No name for this yet, though, right?

30:22.954 --> 30:23.174
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

30:24.255 --> 30:24.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Foreign ads?

30:25.075 --> 30:26.496
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all leaking from foreign?

30:26.576 --> 30:28.117
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Italian, it looks like.

30:30.278 --> 30:31.339
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we trust the Italians?

30:31.399 --> 30:31.839
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

30:33.860 --> 30:34.601
[SPEAKER_04]: They're dirty.

30:35.841 --> 30:36.622
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks really cool.

30:36.822 --> 30:39.984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very sleek, not so much slim.

30:40.944 --> 30:43.646
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like it could poke your eye out because it's also very pointy.

30:44.308 --> 30:46.930
[SPEAKER_11]: They also changed, of course, since it is going to be slimmer.

30:47.030 --> 30:54.593
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very similar to what they were showing in those leaked motherboard development unit pictures.

30:54.973 --> 30:59.916
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically now going to be all integrated into one chip instead of having a separate GPU, CPU.

31:00.636 --> 31:07.041
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're going to have the ventilation on it cooling straight out above the chip instead of going through this duct work that they had in there.

31:07.602 --> 31:08.562
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was kind of neat.

31:08.903 --> 31:12.565
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to tell you guys, I guarantee you it is not called the 360 Slim.

31:12.746 --> 31:16.609
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only being called that because we're used to this kind of redesign thing from Sony's end.

31:17.089 --> 31:18.030
[SPEAKER_14]: They call it the Slim.

31:18.470 --> 31:21.873
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft will call this something else, which we'll hear tomorrow.

31:21.993 --> 31:22.653
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 Cinched.

31:22.993 --> 31:23.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

31:23.354 --> 31:24.575
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it looks like.

31:24.915 --> 31:27.317
[SPEAKER_14]: The 360 Slightly Smaller or the 180.

31:27.377 --> 31:27.557
[SPEAKER_14]: Connect.

31:30.319 --> 31:31.700
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not even get a new name, though.

31:31.760 --> 31:36.123
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can come out with a new system design and still call it the same thing.

31:36.563 --> 31:36.863
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

31:36.903 --> 31:38.464
[SPEAKER_14]: They might just call it the Xbox 360.

31:39.165 --> 31:44.088
[SPEAKER_04]: When they redesigned the old, old Nintendo to be top-loading or whatever, it didn't have a different name.

31:44.148 --> 31:44.508
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

31:44.928 --> 31:53.754
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've already heard about the fact that Microsoft kind of wants to reboot the system and include Natal, excuse me, Kinect as a part of the new system.

31:54.134 --> 31:54.294
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

31:54.834 --> 31:55.475
[SPEAKER_14]: Guarantee it.

31:55.535 --> 32:04.962
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be bundles on the shelves this Christmas with the pointy 360 with Wi-Fi and Kinect all in one box with Kinect Sports or Kinect Kitties or whatever that game was.

32:05.362 --> 32:10.686
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those BS games all together for the low, low price of $250 we'll say.

32:11.067 --> 32:12.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope.

32:12.508 --> 32:12.948
[SPEAKER_11]: $300 I bet you.

32:13.328 --> 32:15.010
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds more realistic.

32:15.670 --> 32:16.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

32:16.851 --> 32:21.935
[SPEAKER_14]: But they'll also sell Netflix and whatever else they're going to announce tomorrow whether it be Hulu or anything else.

32:22.455 --> 32:22.916
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

32:23.717 --> 32:24.478
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:40.549 --> 32:41.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Tornadoes don't blare.

32:41.290 --> 32:42.530
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sirens that blare.

32:42.611 --> 32:43.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Tornadoes spin.

32:43.211 --> 32:43.992
[SPEAKER_14]: The tornado is coming.

32:44.092 --> 32:48.715
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so if the tornado doesn't knock out your connection, you might have to call us once in a while with your breaking news.

32:48.735 --> 32:49.515
[SPEAKER_04]: With my breaking news?

32:49.575 --> 32:49.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

32:50.576 --> 32:54.499
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be like, I just played a retro game on Xbox Live Game Room.

32:54.859 --> 32:55.580
[SPEAKER_04]: It was stupid.

32:56.080 --> 32:56.701
[SPEAKER_04]: Breaking news.

32:57.021 --> 32:57.241
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

32:57.641 --> 33:01.484
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, let's fast forward to next week.

33:01.524 --> 33:04.106
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov will call in live to the show and it'll go something like this.

33:14.571 --> 33:20.453
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it looks like that Miklatov is calling into the show.

33:20.573 --> 33:22.353
[SPEAKER_14]: He's calling in with some breaking news.

33:22.773 --> 33:27.315
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go live to Miklatov and see what is going on in gaming news.

33:27.395 --> 33:27.995
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov.

33:28.015 --> 33:28.975
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

33:30.455 --> 33:31.436
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

33:32.876 --> 33:33.896
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.297
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

33:37.375 --> 33:41.676
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, apparently there's been a takeover of our feed from Understation Live.

33:41.696 --> 33:45.317
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what that is all about, but that just wasn't funny.

33:45.758 --> 33:47.198
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's move on.

33:47.998 --> 33:49.999
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, do you have some gaming news for us?

33:50.379 --> 33:54.380
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's regarding rumors about the 3DS.

33:54.620 --> 34:03.363
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently there's reports out saying that the system is more powerful than the Wii, and unlike what was previously thought, it will not be using the new NVIDIA chips.

34:04.263 --> 34:15.428
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, apparently both IGN and Eurogamer have been reporting that, uh, developers have said off the record, which is funny because they're reporting on it, so if it was off the record, wouldn't it be not reported on it?

34:15.448 --> 34:16.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that would be on the record?

34:17.468 --> 34:17.708
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

34:18.449 --> 34:21.310
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, that the handheld won't use the Nvidia Tegra chip.

34:22.270 --> 34:35.177
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, YourGamer is saying that the 3DS hardware is internally known as CTR, suggesting that the motherboard image submitted to the FCC in May, which noted CTR as a codename, was indeed the 3DS.

34:35.917 --> 34:43.481
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that's kind of interesting, Kotaku I know posted a mock-up of what they thought the 3DS would look like based off of what they saw on the website.

34:43.961 --> 34:51.603
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny that they didn't really pick up on the analog nub that was on there since it looks exactly like the analog nub on the PSP.

34:51.983 --> 34:54.844
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, it will have an analog nub on there.

34:54.884 --> 35:00.465
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, the top screen is going to be widescreen, bottom screen not widescreen.

35:00.485 --> 35:07.407
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, they're going to have some sort of toggle on there to adjust how much 3D is on there, I guess.

35:07.767 --> 35:11.068
[SPEAKER_11]: You can adjust, I guess, the depth field or whatever.

35:13.529 --> 35:29.880
[SPEAKER_11]: And according to IGN also, they're saying that several developers have experienced 3DS in its current form and have reported off the record that its processing capabilities far exceed the Nintendo Wii and bring the device up with abilities that are close to the HD consoles such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

35:30.940 --> 35:39.644
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's the case, thank God, Nintendo, you finally did something right and actually put out a console that has better tech than what's already out there.

35:39.704 --> 35:43.887
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of saying, well, it's not going to be about technology, it's going to be about the gameplay.

35:43.927 --> 35:44.607
[SPEAKER_11]: Because guess what?

35:44.647 --> 35:45.747
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the gameplay is all the same.

35:45.867 --> 35:48.809
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's got to be about the tech now.

35:49.229 --> 35:56.933
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be kind of weird to see what the Wii is going to do with all these new motion controllers and stuff like that now that they're kind of on an even playing field.

36:00.626 --> 36:06.548
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of intrigues me that a handheld system could possibly be as powerful as some of the stuff that's in our living room.

36:06.568 --> 36:07.349
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it makes sense.

36:07.749 --> 36:16.433
[SPEAKER_14]: The technology, I mean, this cycle of video games really has lasted longer than I think a lot of people have expected it to.

36:16.493 --> 36:19.994
[SPEAKER_14]: And you remember they came out and said, PlayStation 3 is going to have a 10-year life cycle.

36:20.014 --> 36:21.675
[SPEAKER_14]: 360 is going to have these long life cycles.

36:22.015 --> 36:26.557
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems to really be happening because usually we should be hearing about new consoles this year at E3.

36:26.837 --> 36:27.698
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's not going to happen.

36:28.098 --> 36:31.759
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if you want to blame the economy or the investment on these or what.

36:31.839 --> 36:32.539
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really know.

36:32.919 --> 36:36.720
[SPEAKER_14]: But the point is, you know, these consoles are still there.

36:37.220 --> 36:38.520
[SPEAKER_14]: And the technology is a little bit old.

36:39.721 --> 36:42.421
[SPEAKER_14]: It's interesting to me, though, that now the handhelds have already caught up.

36:42.481 --> 36:44.982
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think a lot of us also kind of think, oh, well, Nintendo.

36:46.042 --> 36:48.303
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, the Advance was basically a Super Nintendo.

36:49.203 --> 36:51.143
[SPEAKER_14]: The DS was basically a Nintendo 64.

36:51.423 --> 36:53.544
[SPEAKER_14]: So logically, the next system is basically a...

36:54.484 --> 36:55.065
[SPEAKER_05]: GameCube.

36:55.565 --> 36:58.289
[SPEAKER_14]: And then again, the Wii is also kind of basically a GameCube, isn't it?

36:59.190 --> 36:59.970
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn, WiiCube.

37:00.311 --> 37:03.134
[SPEAKER_14]: And they also usually do improve it like a little bit, right?

37:03.534 --> 37:03.995
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I crazy?

37:06.109 --> 37:08.451
[SPEAKER_14]: They kind of, like, you know, it would be improved, like, a little bit.

37:08.491 --> 37:12.534
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, the DS felt like a little more than just a Nintendo 64, is it just me?

37:13.295 --> 37:19.320
[SPEAKER_11]: But they need a new gimmick because, I mean, if you want to play touchscreen games now, I mean, you have the iPhone, you have the iPad.

37:21.322 --> 37:29.128
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's not really any more... I mean, they're not the unique game system out there anymore.

37:29.469 --> 37:33.292
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, with, you know, this new system, now that they have 3D...

37:34.954 --> 37:43.176
[SPEAKER_11]: No other system is doing that right now unless PlayStation announces a new PSP which will be 3D as well because I'm sure they will try to do something like that.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.409
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll be digital downloads only because it's an experiment.

37:47.650 --> 37:48.591
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get to that in a little bit.

37:48.951 --> 37:50.272
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do some comments from our chat room.

37:50.313 --> 37:55.577
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat.OrangeLionTradio.com Jay Dizzle wants you all to know he's connecting on the toilet right now.

37:56.297 --> 38:04.624
[SPEAKER_14]: Tiger Claw says, you know, don't be surprised if Sony announces the PSP2 with 3D support if you buy the 3D add-on glasses, which will probably be their way to counter the 3DS.

38:05.184 --> 38:05.485
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

38:06.305 --> 38:08.447
[SPEAKER_14]: SSJ100Matt says, so this is a confirmed rumor?

38:08.507 --> 38:10.809
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop talking to us in riddles and oxymorons, dammit.

38:12.308 --> 38:18.713
[SPEAKER_14]: Bochikawa says, this might be a good move for Nintendo, putting their cards in the mobile market and selling the Wii or predecessors to soccer moms and six-year-olds.

38:19.334 --> 38:21.295
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually really not a bad strategy.

38:21.696 --> 38:23.137
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been working for them so far.

38:23.557 --> 38:23.917
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

38:25.719 --> 38:26.319
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my problem.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.481
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're gonna hate this, but...

38:29.758 --> 38:34.861
[SPEAKER_11]: My problem with Nintendo is I don't think they know how to deal with new hardware as far as advanced stuff.

38:34.901 --> 38:38.883
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you notice, what were some of the games that we got when the Wii came out?

38:39.563 --> 38:40.403
[SPEAKER_11]: GameCube ports.

38:41.084 --> 38:44.306
[SPEAKER_11]: What are some of the games that we got on the Nintendo DS?

38:44.366 --> 38:48.848
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically ports of stuff that was on Nintendo 64 and that kind of stuff.

38:48.868 --> 38:52.650
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I was about to jump in there and say, but OMG, the Zelda game, it was amazing.

38:52.670 --> 38:54.851
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, oh yeah, there was a GameCube version of that.

38:55.552 --> 38:57.594
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, it was a GameCube port.

38:58.715 --> 39:05.161
[SPEAKER_11]: Granted, they're going to have this wonderful new shiny hardware and they're going to be able to do really amazing stuff, but it won't come right away.

39:05.441 --> 39:11.506
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be, oh look, we were working on this game for the DS, but now that we have the 3DS, let's just port it over and it'll be in 3D.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.128
[SPEAKER_11]: But the graphics will be really simple.

39:13.448 --> 39:38.472
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a crazy thought really crazy super crazy thought you guys here's my crazy thought we know that there's a new Zelda game that's supposed to be coming at E3 this year right and that it's supposed to be like a better looking type of game it's going to be you know kind of specially designed and it's going to be uber and all that stuff what if the Zelda game is actually a 3DS game well I'm sure they will have a 3DS Zelda game but I think it's actually going to be on the Wii hmm

39:39.294 --> 40:00.204
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm most worried about the screen size now the rumored screen size to be the size of the DSi screens because I picked up an XL because I'm a Nintendo whore at least in the handheld sense and I can't go back I mean that screen really does not lose that much resolution in my opinion and it'd be really nice to have another system with screens that big

40:00.615 --> 40:05.496
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to point out too, Miklatov is actually in studio right now wearing a 1-Up beanie, so he's not lying.

40:05.536 --> 40:08.998
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not talking about that website, I'm talking about the actual 1-Up mushroom.

40:09.398 --> 40:09.578
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

40:09.718 --> 40:10.078
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

40:10.778 --> 40:11.178
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

40:12.178 --> 40:17.000
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of rumored games that are coming out for the 3DS, Destructoid has ran a story.

40:17.020 --> 40:22.982
[SPEAKER_14]: According to their sources, they strongly believe that Nintendo has been getting the developers and publishers over with the 3DS.

40:24.002 --> 40:29.967
[SPEAKER_14]: Demo of Animal Crossing apparently is an internal demo that they're showing off to developers to try and get people over.

40:30.808 --> 40:35.652
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the game that's supposed to be revealed this next week as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS.

40:36.092 --> 40:42.478
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo went back into a corner and said comment on this, dammit, has said Nintendo does not comment on rumors or speculation.

40:42.798 --> 40:46.301
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen Nintendo, if you're putting out another Animal Crossing game, I'm not fucking buying it.

40:46.641 --> 40:47.182
[SPEAKER_11]: You know why?

40:47.522 --> 40:51.845
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because the last two games you've put out have been exactly the same as the first one except with less features.

40:52.679 --> 40:56.941
[SPEAKER_11]: So go fuck yourself with your fucking Animal Crossing because I am... What if... Hold on.

40:57.241 --> 40:57.481
[SPEAKER_14]: Anger.

40:57.741 --> 40:58.201
[SPEAKER_14]: Angry man.

40:58.481 --> 40:59.682
[SPEAKER_14]: Angry man sitting over there in the chair.

41:00.342 --> 41:00.722
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

41:01.102 --> 41:04.644
[SPEAKER_14]: What if they've actually made changes?

41:04.764 --> 41:06.364
[SPEAKER_14]: They won't.

41:06.404 --> 41:07.685
[SPEAKER_11]: They've actually made changes.

41:08.285 --> 41:11.106
[SPEAKER_11]: What if... What if... Stay with me here.

41:13.140 --> 41:15.020
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell had ice in it.

41:16.481 --> 41:20.181
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you would put it kindly, froze over.

41:20.901 --> 41:23.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, if you read the Inferno, the core of hell is icy.

41:26.642 --> 41:32.003
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but the hell that Nintendo is familiar with does not have ice in it.

41:33.284 --> 41:34.004
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm sorry.

41:35.224 --> 41:38.125
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I can see them doing is adding 3D to it.

41:38.265 --> 41:40.585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really going to be the same fucking game all over again.

41:41.935 --> 41:43.095
[SPEAKER_04]: They might add a new fruit.

41:43.735 --> 41:44.255
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.316
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make people buy it.

41:46.336 --> 41:58.218
[SPEAKER_14]: And they might take out your villagers and put them in the city now because, you know, that's... Wait, what if, what if, what if, stay with me here, what if, what if they gave the animals machine guns?

41:59.178 --> 41:59.798
[SPEAKER_14]: Never forget.

42:01.439 --> 42:03.039
[SPEAKER_11]: They will never give them machine guns.

42:03.299 --> 42:04.439
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll give them squirt guns.

42:07.320 --> 42:07.740
[SPEAKER_11]: Paintball.

42:09.178 --> 42:11.740
[SPEAKER_11]: That paintball would be cool.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.581
[SPEAKER_14]: Question, question, question, question, question.

42:15.062 --> 42:19.064
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the best part about Animal Crossing when you would play it for the first time?

42:19.488 --> 42:25.430
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitting the people with the net Terrorizing the animals in your village, correct?

42:25.530 --> 42:39.414
[SPEAKER_14]: Digging holes around them so they couldn't move Exactly What if Nintendo made a game that was nothing but terrorizing your villagers in Animal Crossing So they're going to bring the Sims to the DS?

42:39.534 --> 42:39.774
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the 3DS?

42:42.575 --> 42:45.016
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I realize, you know what DarkSakura used to do?

42:45.056 --> 42:47.417
[SPEAKER_14]: She would make gay pride flags and put them outside of people's houses.

42:47.457 --> 42:51.159
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because I had a lesbian in my town.

42:51.379 --> 42:54.340
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the chick that had the P.E.

42:54.380 --> 42:54.660
[SPEAKER_02]: room.

42:55.701 --> 42:56.381
[SPEAKER_02]: What was she, a duck?

42:57.265 --> 42:58.625
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

42:58.665 --> 42:59.906
[SPEAKER_04]: They just replaced like a letter.

43:00.126 --> 43:12.830
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was wearing sweats and had PE equipment and she would ask questions that could be taken the wrong way so we put a big rainbow sign outside of her house.

43:13.550 --> 43:15.651
[SPEAKER_02]: She was our town lesbian and then she moved to Rob's town.

43:15.671 --> 43:16.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

43:16.331 --> 43:17.973
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, hold on, this is great.

43:18.414 --> 43:21.918
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me a gold star stat, because a chatter just won a gold star here.

43:21.998 --> 43:23.820
[SPEAKER_14]: Get me a gold star stat for this comment.

43:24.281 --> 43:28.046
[SPEAKER_14]: BauerCTU says, animal double crossing.

43:28.947 --> 43:29.267
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

43:29.607 --> 43:29.928
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it!

43:30.629 --> 43:31.470
[SPEAKER_11]: Reggie, you listening?

43:33.069 --> 43:33.929
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

43:52.842 --> 44:19.135
[SPEAKER_11]: so I mean come on it's not going to steal away sales from the Wii it's just going to be really kick ass and you know what you can do you can sell your wonderful virtual console games as downloadable content for Animal Crossing there's a thought but it would be a creative thought and embracing digital content and online something Nintendo does not do it's the scariest thing in the world to them

44:21.799 --> 44:23.121
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be an interesting E3.

44:23.161 --> 44:24.904
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's kind of punchy in studio tonight.

44:24.944 --> 44:25.565
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of like this.

44:25.685 --> 44:26.426
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

44:27.668 --> 44:28.830
[SPEAKER_14]: God, just think about the show.

44:31.934 --> 44:32.974
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more news.

44:33.694 --> 44:35.675
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm done with this 3DS thing until I get to see it.

44:35.715 --> 44:47.397
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say, the plan right now, in quotes, unless something super awesome is revealed in the next couple days that we decide we have to see on the show floor, Miklatov and I plan to go run and see the 3DS first.

44:47.437 --> 44:47.998
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't run.

44:48.398 --> 44:49.798
[SPEAKER_04]: I might walk a little fast.

44:49.838 --> 44:51.378
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll walk in accelerated pace.

44:51.718 --> 44:52.319
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kind of old.

44:52.839 --> 44:56.860
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll walk with a cane in an accelerated pace towards the 3DS line.

44:59.100 --> 45:22.203
[SPEAKER_14]: uh over at Nintendo because the thought is everybody's still going to be at Sony's press conference so we want to do the 3DS thing first so we're hoping that'll be on the first show Tuesday night Rob Roberts and pals all right uh Loki let's do something besides the 3DS what you got for us um well let's see the PSP Go apparently was an experiment according to Sony they're claiming that um

45:23.820 --> 45:25.682
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

45:45.561 --> 45:50.422
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... That sounds like a poor excuse for the reason why your console failed.

45:50.922 --> 45:59.384
[SPEAKER_11]: Not because your console was, I don't know, $80 more than, say, the same console that had media already.

45:59.684 --> 46:08.687
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically had all the same features, except the ability to actually, you know, buy disc-based games and be able to sell those games back when you're done with them.

46:09.487 --> 46:09.587
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

46:10.727 --> 46:15.610
[SPEAKER_11]: If you really wanted to know where your consumer behavior was, put out a fucking survey.

46:15.871 --> 46:17.892
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need to create a new console.

46:19.733 --> 46:22.815
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a failure, and that's what it was.

46:22.855 --> 46:24.076
[SPEAKER_11]: Do not call it an experiment.

46:24.216 --> 46:25.297
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a failure.

46:29.372 --> 46:33.657
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, it's just kind of one of those like, boy, they ran away with their tail between its legs.

46:33.697 --> 46:34.438
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, is this it?

46:34.498 --> 46:42.086
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this kind of like an official confirmation, you think, of the fact that it's a done deal and the PSP Go is no longer going to be sold?

46:42.146 --> 46:43.187
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what's the deal?

46:43.708 --> 46:44.088
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

46:44.128 --> 46:45.850
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you heard anything about this getting pulled from shelves?

46:46.051 --> 46:47.632
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't heard anything, but let me put it this way.

46:47.652 --> 46:50.636
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they haven't really been selling like hotcakes, I mean, at all.

46:51.216 --> 46:52.057
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you expect?

46:52.097 --> 47:00.442
[SPEAKER_11]: You're putting out a console to your retailers and you're saying, oh, by the way, your customers aren't going to be able to buy any sort of software for this from you.

47:01.842 --> 47:03.443
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can sell our console for us.

47:03.563 --> 47:07.486
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, by the way, you're not going to make any money off those consoles because consoles have no markup whatsoever.

47:07.986 --> 47:14.990
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, go ahead and sell this for no sort of profit whatsoever and then you're not going to profit for it later on.

47:15.390 --> 47:18.112
[SPEAKER_11]: Most consumers or retailers out there are going to go,

47:19.112 --> 47:23.856
[SPEAKER_11]: How about fuck you, and I'm just going to carry the regular PSP where I can sell the same games.

47:24.417 --> 47:30.982
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, not all the games were available digitally right away anyways, so what's the point?

47:32.043 --> 47:34.045
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the problem, is they pissed everybody off.

47:34.245 --> 47:38.428
[SPEAKER_11]: It was also more expensive than the PSP was, which made no fucking sense whatsoever.

47:40.210 --> 47:42.532
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was just a bad...

47:43.999 --> 47:44.959
[SPEAKER_11]: Bad plan altogether.

47:45.899 --> 47:52.721
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have charged less for it since it didn't have UMD drive and it would have gotten people to actually maybe pick it up.

47:53.201 --> 48:08.825
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was absolutely no reason whatsoever to pick up a PSP Go because you could just buy a PSP 3000 and a memory unit and have basically the exact same thing and the flexibility to either buy your games on disk or buy them via digital download.

48:11.605 --> 48:15.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I missed all the PSP hate, and I hate it too, the go.

48:15.207 --> 48:15.948
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was dumb.

48:16.928 --> 48:18.409
[SPEAKER_04]: I will share a quick little story.

48:18.850 --> 48:27.695
[SPEAKER_04]: At the store I work at, which I'm sure I can't name or get fired, we have sold, I kid you not, since the system came out, three.

48:28.476 --> 48:28.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Just three.

48:29.677 --> 48:32.859
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talked everybody that I could out of it, because...

48:33.659 --> 48:38.342
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like you're saying, a PSP-3000 with a decent-sized memory stick.

48:38.783 --> 48:42.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as good and way better, actually, than the Go could ever be.

48:42.509 --> 48:47.151
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, if you buy the Sony memory sticks, then maybe it might be, you know, somewhat of a good deal.

48:47.231 --> 48:54.933
[SPEAKER_11]: But since everybody doesn't, you know, double the retail price of their memory units, you could go buy a third-party SanDisk memory stick and it'd be just fine.

48:57.034 --> 49:04.216
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's assuming if you want to download all your damn games, which most people are not going to do that because you can buy a PSP game on disk.

49:04.636 --> 49:05.917
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're done with it, guess what?

49:06.517 --> 49:09.618
[SPEAKER_11]: You could sell it and make your money back.

49:10.058 --> 49:14.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget about our friend who has had all the trouble with his downloads, too.

49:14.321 --> 49:19.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have no problem with those digital download games that are only available via digital download.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.125
[SPEAKER_11]: But guess what?

49:20.145 --> 49:22.706
[SPEAKER_11]: With the PSP 3000, you can also download those!

49:23.807 --> 49:29.351
[SPEAKER_11]: They just were trying to make it seem like the PSP Go was the only system able to access this marketplace.

49:29.631 --> 49:34.254
[SPEAKER_11]: And the problem was they were trying to basically compete with the iPhone or something like that.

49:34.374 --> 49:38.317
[SPEAKER_11]: But you kind of have to have those types of features in there, like GPS and...

49:38.837 --> 49:40.758
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever actually held one?

49:55.413 --> 49:55.513
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

49:55.713 --> 49:58.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they feel like plastic little toys.

49:58.874 --> 49:59.634
[SPEAKER_04]: They are awful.

49:59.974 --> 50:01.294
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel like you're going to break it.

50:01.414 --> 50:04.075
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that top screen alone does not feel very secure.

50:04.115 --> 50:09.516
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're sliding it up and down, I can only imagine that it won't last, like it will break.

50:11.976 --> 50:22.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Quickly, kind of one big rumor, big, big rumor that's floating around about what we're going to hear in a couple days, namely Tuesday morning when Sony does their press conference, we may hear something about a PSP 2.

50:22.819 --> 50:25.039
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think there's any truth to that rumor?

50:25.299 --> 50:33.025
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if it's going to come out, it's going to come out probably around the same time frame as Gran Turismo 3, which means in a few years.

50:34.526 --> 50:35.467
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean Gran Turismo 5?

50:35.627 --> 50:35.987
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

50:36.007 --> 50:38.449
[SPEAKER_11]: 5-3, it doesn't matter.

50:39.090 --> 50:41.792
[SPEAKER_04]: The game isn't coming up this year, that's what it matters.

50:41.992 --> 50:44.334
[SPEAKER_14]: At first, I was like, no, they're not doing it.

50:44.854 --> 50:48.417
[SPEAKER_14]: But now that I'm hearing this whole disavowing of the PSP Go...

50:50.685 --> 50:52.466
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes a lot more sense that that could be where they're going.

50:52.546 --> 50:55.927
[SPEAKER_11]: Three is the number of Forza games that will be out before Gran Turismo 5.

50:57.608 --> 50:57.768
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

50:58.548 --> 51:00.649
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean additional Forza games.

51:00.809 --> 51:02.450
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyond the third one we've already had.

51:02.470 --> 51:03.410
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyond two and three, yeah.

51:04.389 --> 51:05.269
[SPEAKER_14]: I like my PSP.

51:05.309 --> 51:07.270
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the PSP is a pretty good system.

51:07.630 --> 51:09.430
[SPEAKER_14]: It was lacking in games for a while.

51:09.510 --> 51:10.610
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, Luminous was cool.

51:10.930 --> 51:13.391
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was really lacking in games for a while.

51:13.431 --> 51:15.491
[SPEAKER_14]: But then it started getting some real kick-butt stuff.

51:15.531 --> 51:18.932
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially with the Final Fantasy games were re-released for it.

51:19.292 --> 51:19.992
[SPEAKER_14]: It had some good stuff.

51:20.152 --> 51:21.112
[SPEAKER_11]: But I gotta be honest, though.

51:21.172 --> 51:24.413
[SPEAKER_11]: Even with just regular PSP, it's not been doing great.

51:24.653 --> 51:30.274
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even just talking to my retailers about bringing in PSP titles, they're really just...

51:30.914 --> 51:35.619
[SPEAKER_11]: Bringing in some to have them on the shelf, but it's not a big representation.

51:36.059 --> 51:39.383
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of hurting them.

51:39.403 --> 51:44.568
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially now with the 3DS, people are going to be like, whatever, I'm not buying anything on the PSP.

51:44.968 --> 51:46.670
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've got to come out with something new.

51:48.212 --> 51:49.193
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be out this year?

51:49.573 --> 51:50.594
[SPEAKER_11]: I highly doubt it.

51:51.511 --> 51:53.172
[SPEAKER_14]: Osfer brings up Valkyria Chronicles 2.

51:53.793 --> 51:55.274
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like it might be pretty cool.

51:55.374 --> 51:59.617
[SPEAKER_04]: The Phantasy Star Portable 2 is also coming, which is somewhat big to people I know.

51:59.877 --> 52:06.302
[SPEAKER_14]: Alpha Catanagram in our chatroom is mentioning that there is a giant Kevin Butler E3 banner, apparently, at the convention center right now.

52:06.622 --> 52:09.744
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I need to say something since you mentioned Phantasy Star Portable.

52:09.764 --> 52:09.964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

52:10.764 --> 52:21.589
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Krista, if you go on Sega's website and look at the contest that they did for doing fan art, she won third place doing pixel style art of the characters.

52:22.009 --> 52:22.289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

52:22.309 --> 52:23.530
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to Krista.

52:23.650 --> 52:24.210
[SPEAKER_14]: Congrats to you.

52:24.230 --> 52:24.811
[SPEAKER_14]: What does she win?

52:25.731 --> 52:26.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Copy the game.

52:26.711 --> 52:27.732
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hey, that's something.

52:28.172 --> 52:29.032
[SPEAKER_14]: Free stuff is good.

52:29.913 --> 52:30.153
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

52:32.170 --> 52:32.712
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts

52:38.348 --> 52:43.970
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts has got a new game announced at E3, but it's not the big number three.

52:44.010 --> 52:45.751
[SPEAKER_14]: It is Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

52:45.771 --> 52:47.551
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a rumor about this on last week's show.

52:47.591 --> 52:48.752
[SPEAKER_14]: It does look like it is official.

52:49.192 --> 52:51.913
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts Recoded is coming out for the DS.

52:52.253 --> 52:58.375
[SPEAKER_14]: It's by the same people that were behind 358 slash two days, and it will be on the show floor at E3.

52:58.795 --> 53:03.477
[SPEAKER_14]: It apparently is going to be a remake of the Japanese mobile game Kingdom Hearts Coded.

53:03.837 --> 53:05.257
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like they did with Chains of Memories.

53:05.277 --> 53:07.298
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember Kingdom Hearts Re Chains of Memories?

53:07.634 --> 53:07.854
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

53:09.395 --> 53:10.576
[SPEAKER_14]: No word on the release date yet.

53:10.616 --> 53:12.197
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know if it's going to be this year or next.

53:12.657 --> 53:13.718
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully this Christmas.

53:13.838 --> 53:19.202
[SPEAKER_14]: But it will be about Sora retracing his steps through the original Kingdom Hearts.

53:19.962 --> 53:26.046
[SPEAKER_14]: Jiminy Cricket apparently is looking over the journal he used to document his first adventure with Sora and he discovers a mysterious message.

53:26.706 --> 53:27.147
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

53:27.367 --> 53:28.928
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not something he wrote?

53:28.968 --> 53:29.748
[SPEAKER_14]: So how did it get there?

53:29.969 --> 53:30.389
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

53:31.109 --> 53:33.151
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds confusing, just like the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

53:33.971 --> 53:35.312
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I roll my eyes to.

53:36.092 --> 53:36.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

53:37.473 --> 53:38.914
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts is not that great.

53:39.695 --> 53:40.635
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of boring.

53:40.876 --> 53:41.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's pretty cool.

53:41.556 --> 53:43.497
[SPEAKER_11]: Was the message sitting on the toilet?

53:47.420 --> 53:49.962
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

53:50.022 --> 53:51.062
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, you got something for us?

53:52.403 --> 53:52.944
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nuts.

53:54.445 --> 53:54.805
[SPEAKER_14]: Me too.

53:57.938 --> 54:01.700
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is actually about our good friends at Capcom.

54:02.961 --> 54:07.324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their E3 lineup and I'm pretty excited.

54:07.764 --> 54:14.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Fate of Two Worlds, which by the way I saw the last trailer and it has Deadpool and Dante and that made me very squee.

54:16.612 --> 54:28.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Okamiden, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes, Ghost Trick Phantom Detective, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 2 Case Zero, MotoGP 910.

54:30.365 --> 54:33.048
[SPEAKER_14]: So it sounds like Capcom's booth is going to be pretty hopping.

54:33.108 --> 54:35.250
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is playable.

54:35.819 --> 54:37.981
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me lots of pictures and get me lots of swag.

54:38.202 --> 54:38.482
[SPEAKER_14]: I will.

54:38.762 --> 54:39.483
[SPEAKER_14]: I really want to play it.

54:39.843 --> 54:41.145
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Deadpool stuff.

54:41.205 --> 54:42.546
[SPEAKER_14]: I will play as Deadpool just for you.

54:43.087 --> 54:43.547
[SPEAKER_02]: You better.

54:43.927 --> 54:45.249
[SPEAKER_14]: And he'll be terrible.

54:45.429 --> 54:47.651
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I will because I'm terrible at Marvel vs. Capcom.

54:47.831 --> 54:49.753
[SPEAKER_02]: But Deadpool has guns and snark.

54:50.134 --> 54:50.855
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that's not true.

54:50.875 --> 54:54.999
[SPEAKER_14]: When I played at that retro arcade a couple weeks ago in Portland, I just kind of button mashed and I did pretty good.

54:56.812 --> 55:05.876
[SPEAKER_14]: all I you just do you know it's all Street Fighter moves like quarter circle forward and and back and forward and you know it's just all it's all Street Fighter moves you just do a bunch of Street Fighter moves and then your characters are going well

55:07.150 --> 55:07.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising 2 K-Zero

55:34.934 --> 55:37.120
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing off a demo at E3 of a demo.

55:37.882 --> 55:38.644
[SPEAKER_04]: A demo of a demo.

55:38.824 --> 55:39.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

55:39.627 --> 55:39.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

55:41.817 --> 55:53.004
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an editorial written on Kotaku this week talking about the trend going on with these new sports games from THQ and EA.

55:54.145 --> 56:05.733
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember the one-time use online codes that are part of the Project $10, or I guess in THQ's case, we want another $5 from you.

56:08.174 --> 56:11.417
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought there were some points that were kind of interesting that they brought up in this.

56:12.498 --> 56:21.586
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it kind of tying into will it really be that big a deal for consumers out there that are interested in buying used products because it's going to be additional money.

56:22.146 --> 56:28.852
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they were saying that GameStop has been starting to drop in the trade-in values of different games.

56:29.273 --> 56:33.356
[SPEAKER_11]: For most new releases, which you used to be able to get for $30, you're now getting $25.

56:34.937 --> 56:59.017
[SPEAKER_11]: and also some of the games like for example UFC the use price is now $44.99 which is $5 cheaper than the other new releases so they're kind of factoring in okay you're going to pay another $5 to get online and it's going to bring it up to the price of a normal use game or a normal use game of that quality that time frame that kind of stuff.

57:00.038 --> 57:02.320
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so maybe it won't be that big of an impact.

57:02.520 --> 57:17.949
[SPEAKER_11]: I still say don't forget what's going on, though, because as soon as you say, well, that's not so bad, you know, that's when they start going, okay, well, now you're gonna be having to pay for this, and you're gonna have to pay for this, and pay for this, and this, and this, and this, and just gonna go on and on.

57:19.510 --> 57:22.572
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, also they're saying that, uh, the...

57:24.323 --> 57:29.933
[SPEAKER_11]: One-time use code has diminished resale expectations.

57:31.155 --> 57:35.743
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying that people who tend to be passionate about games on their consoles...

57:37.932 --> 57:42.357
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been selling them back in.

57:42.397 --> 57:43.478
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

57:43.638 --> 57:44.539
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting, though.

57:45.700 --> 57:47.202
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this is going to keep going on.

57:47.562 --> 57:57.532
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, there was a rumor, and I'm sure we're not going to hear anything about it until the game comes out, but it is a few weeks from now that Microsoft will be following suit with Crackdown 2.

57:57.573 --> 57:58.433
[SPEAKER_11]: Get ready.

58:01.144 --> 58:08.609
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kind of irritated because yet another reason that I don't know if it was so obvious at first, but it just diminishes the value of the game to be able to resell.

58:09.110 --> 58:16.695
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if you do get the $10 code for free when it's new, if you use it, it's totally diminishing the value of the game that you sell back.

58:17.236 --> 58:19.557
[SPEAKER_14]: And that I think is probably one of the most irritating components of this.

58:19.878 --> 58:25.282
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the end of the day, the only way that you can express your distaste

58:26.087 --> 58:26.567
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

58:45.414 --> 59:11.985
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't buy used games anymore and a lot of stuff if I'm going to buy it in the first place I'm buying it new if I'm not buying it right when it comes out new then I'm not going to buy it at all so for me since this is really just affecting used games and stuff like that it's not a big deal now if I wanted to loan it to a friend or something like that that kind of sucks for them but I don't really run into that situation that much

59:13.786 --> 59:18.288
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's got guys in their skeevies over there.

59:18.328 --> 59:19.288
[SPEAKER_14]: What is going on over there?

59:19.348 --> 59:21.329
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just picking his pajamas.

59:21.449 --> 59:23.010
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not pajamas.

59:23.230 --> 59:26.271
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known guys who just sleep in their underwear.

59:26.371 --> 59:27.771
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I know, but I'm just saying.

59:28.292 --> 59:29.832
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just funny because I looked over.

59:29.852 --> 59:30.913
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, what is she playing?

59:31.093 --> 59:34.154
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the pajamas in the game, so I just had him sleep in his undies.

59:35.254 --> 59:37.415
[SPEAKER_02]: But his undies are Calvin Klein.

59:37.455 --> 59:39.016
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded Calvin Klein undies.

59:39.176 --> 59:41.437
[SPEAKER_14]: You should get him bananas in pajamas.

59:45.067 --> 59:48.268
[SPEAKER_14]: If you really want, I don't care.

59:49.668 --> 59:50.369
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Loki.

59:50.849 --> 59:51.349
[SPEAKER_14]: I looked over there.

59:51.369 --> 59:54.050
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, is DarkSakura watching porn during this program?

59:54.070 --> 59:54.690
[SPEAKER_14]: What is she doing?

59:55.370 --> 59:56.091
[SPEAKER_14]: What is she doing?

59:57.451 --> 59:57.691
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

59:58.131 --> 59:59.952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just interesting because...

01:00:02.188 --> 01:00:17.701
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it just seems to me their excuses for why they're doing it being that they're going to enhance the online, enhance all this community stuff I just have a feeling they're not going to deliver with that in that it's just a desperate cash grab

01:00:18.241 --> 01:00:19.342
[SPEAKER_04]: If they really do that, that's cool.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:22.405
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine with the extra $10 or whatever they're saying.

01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:30.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, it's just taking a key component of the game and charging you for it when it should already be there as part of the normal cost.

01:00:30.774 --> 01:00:33.556
[SPEAKER_11]: My problem is why they're getting money anyways for a used sale.

01:00:34.317 --> 01:00:36.239
[SPEAKER_11]: They really shouldn't deserve that kind of money.

01:00:36.559 --> 01:00:37.259
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't.

01:00:37.279 --> 01:00:38.360
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a comment about that.

01:01:02.546 --> 01:01:15.359
[SPEAKER_04]: With UFC, didn't they implement that so badly that some people that even bought it brand new got double charged because the directions weren't clear when you'd enter the code and it would actually make you pay for the code and then you could use your code?

01:01:15.699 --> 01:01:17.781
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I read stuff about that when it came out.

01:01:17.861 --> 01:01:18.301
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:22.926
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not surprised if that's what actually happened.

01:01:27.661 --> 01:01:29.782
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, moving on.

01:01:29.982 --> 01:01:31.842
[SPEAKER_14]: Boy, I'm just seeing this from chat.

01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:32.903
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody just posted this in chat.

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:34.023
[SPEAKER_04]: You need the breaking news noise.

01:01:34.063 --> 01:01:35.323
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I need the breaking news noise?

01:01:35.363 --> 01:01:36.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's ugly.

01:01:36.364 --> 01:01:37.784
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have the breaking news noise.

01:01:38.944 --> 01:01:40.505
[SPEAKER_14]: Buy me some time.

01:01:40.525 --> 01:01:41.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy me some time.

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:43.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick.

01:01:43.706 --> 01:01:45.446
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking noise, breaking noise, breaking noise.

01:01:45.486 --> 01:01:46.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Breaking noise.

01:01:47.907 --> 01:01:49.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking news, breaking news, blah blah blah.

01:01:50.251 --> 01:02:00.247
[SPEAKER_04]: I could talk about how I am breeding stuff in Pokemon and I bike back and forth on the path so it hatches the eggs quicker because I don't like to run around.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.870
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.380
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's still very popular in Japan.

01:02:34.106 --> 01:02:37.589
[SPEAKER_14]: You can play this game.

01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:40.291
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess a new version of pop music has been announced, but here's the thing.

01:02:40.751 --> 01:02:46.195
[SPEAKER_14]: It is like a US version now because they're testing this in Irvine, California.

01:02:46.215 --> 01:02:49.517
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a ticket redemption machine.

01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:51.058
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate you, Konami.

01:02:51.439 --> 01:02:52.820
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you so much.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.622
[SPEAKER_04]: The logo looks like it's from Beat and Groovy.

01:02:55.922 --> 01:02:56.562
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of does.

01:02:57.642 --> 01:02:59.203
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami, you just don't get it anymore.

01:02:59.303 --> 01:02:59.984
[SPEAKER_11]: You're fired.

01:03:00.684 --> 01:03:01.885
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm firing you, Konami.

01:03:01.905 --> 01:03:03.327
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot make any more music games.

01:03:06.601 --> 01:03:10.824
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami, a company that thinks Saw is a viable franchise for video games.

01:03:11.064 --> 01:03:12.826
[SPEAKER_04]: That Saw game was not awful.

01:03:13.146 --> 01:03:16.048
[SPEAKER_04]: I will defend that game because it was fun except for the combat.

01:03:16.068 --> 01:03:18.230
[SPEAKER_04]: The combat was dumb, but the puzzles were fun.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:19.010
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked them.

01:03:19.811 --> 01:03:21.392
[SPEAKER_04]: You just like to kill people horrifically.

01:03:21.772 --> 01:03:22.913
[SPEAKER_04]: With really good puzzles.

01:03:24.374 --> 01:03:26.216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like evil Professor Layton.

01:03:26.496 --> 01:03:27.737
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be a game right there.

01:03:27.817 --> 01:03:28.717
[SPEAKER_14]: Kill them with puzzles.

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:29.878
[SPEAKER_14]: For the 3DS.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:36.205
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami in our chat says, Sky, and you keep saying Konami needs to redesign their rhythm games.

01:03:37.227 --> 01:03:38.128
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what I meant!

01:03:39.169 --> 01:03:40.210
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what I fucking meant!

01:03:41.731 --> 01:03:42.492
[SPEAKER_14]: Ticket game?

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:44.555
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not surprised, one bit.

01:03:44.935 --> 01:03:45.716
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be popular.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.368
[SPEAKER_04]: If the Deal or No Deal game is popular, no, this won't be because it's not something you see on TV with Howie Mandel.

01:03:52.889 --> 01:03:53.230
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:58.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby's World, the Ticket Redemption game, that would be something that would be popular with Howie Mandel.

01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:00.821
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's on the... America's Got Talent.

01:04:00.881 --> 01:04:01.643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that show.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:11.444
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of the Saw type things and so forth, there was a lot of news that came out this week about Mortal Kombat.

01:04:12.184 --> 01:04:17.167
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of them was this very strange teaser that was a mystery and nobody knew what it was.

01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:18.768
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to play a little bit here in studio.

01:04:18.848 --> 01:04:19.368
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it loud?

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:19.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:04:19.748 --> 01:04:20.169
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this.

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:20.749
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:21.049
[SPEAKER_02]: That one?

01:04:25.034 --> 01:04:26.075
[SPEAKER_14]: This thing that came out this week.

01:04:26.155 --> 01:04:26.696
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that?

01:04:26.916 --> 01:04:27.176
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:04:28.157 --> 01:04:30.200
[SPEAKER_14]: That's supposed to be like reptile.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:31.501
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's actually old.

01:04:33.964 --> 01:04:36.046
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy was friends with Jerry Ryan, which is why she's in it.

01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:40.813
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually is a few months old.

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:41.953
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jerry Ryan's in it.

01:04:59.986 --> 01:05:00.787
[SPEAKER_14]: Jerry Ryan is in it.

01:05:00.807 --> 01:05:01.868
[SPEAKER_14]: She's Sonya at the very end.

01:05:01.889 --> 01:05:03.250
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see if I can fast forward the part.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:07.536
[SPEAKER_04]: And Johnny Cage is the motion actor for Nathan Drake from Uncharted 1.

01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:08.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really?

01:05:08.617 --> 01:05:09.518
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's Jerry Ryan.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:13.761
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:05:38.278 --> 01:05:41.339
[SPEAKER_02]: I love these reimagining pitches though.

01:05:41.379 --> 01:05:45.240
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the one for Nightmare on Elm Street before they had decided to redo it.

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.040
[SPEAKER_02]: That some guy just funded.

01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:52.922
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a really ballsy thing for them to do is to put it up on the internet for all the public scrutiny.

01:05:53.302 --> 01:05:57.543
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy must have believed in the thing that much and so far the reception's been pretty positive.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:05:58.543
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

01:05:58.844 --> 01:05:59.604
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta be honest.

01:05:59.704 --> 01:06:01.084
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna go against the grain a little bit.

01:06:01.484 --> 01:06:03.585
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's well done and it's nice but...

01:06:04.705 --> 01:06:08.587
[SPEAKER_14]: I always kind of liked Mortal Kombat because it was a little bit over the top and cartoony.

01:06:09.228 --> 01:06:13.310
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was a little bit like gritty, real saw for me.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.890
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

01:06:13.991 --> 01:06:15.351
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how I feel about that.

01:06:16.032 --> 01:06:21.055
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's how the movie would actually turn out, but I was kind of like, I kind of like Mortal Kombat because it was always a little bit ridiculous.

01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:22.455
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one did it best.

01:06:23.176 --> 01:06:24.737
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one was a waste of time.

01:06:26.141 --> 01:06:31.002
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm all for, I guess, them trying to give this guy a chance, especially since so many people seem to be into it.

01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:34.364
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just because I have one opinion, you know, whatever, I guess I might get outvoted.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:37.424
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I guess it could be cool.

01:06:37.484 --> 01:06:44.527
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was really seven minutes of this cop interrogation, and I would just hope the movie is a little... Well, no, it wasn't just the interrogation.

01:06:44.587 --> 01:06:46.807
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... Yeah, I guess it had the fight with Johnny Cage.

01:06:46.847 --> 01:06:48.928
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like introducing the characters.

01:06:49.648 --> 01:06:51.749
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was awesome, and they should totally make the movie.

01:06:54.195 --> 01:06:54.975
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see, we'll see.

01:06:54.995 --> 01:06:56.596
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my least favorite character in the series.

01:06:56.616 --> 01:06:58.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Johnny Cage, can't catch a break.

01:06:59.037 --> 01:07:02.339
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like doing the foot through the heart and then signing the autograph.

01:07:02.379 --> 01:07:03.059
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cool.

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:21.208
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well also, you know, because a lot of people did mistake that this might have been a teaser for the game, apparently there really was a teaser for the game in the works and it showed up a little later, just literally a few days later, a new teaser for Mortal Kombat 9 showed up.

01:07:22.188 --> 01:07:22.508
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.

01:07:46.347 --> 01:07:47.568
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see more characters added.

01:07:47.608 --> 01:07:52.392
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this is just a teaser, but they didn't pick some of the best, that's for sure.

01:08:14.764 --> 01:08:16.565
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that hat on the ground is really funny.

01:08:16.585 --> 01:08:30.373
[SPEAKER_14]: For those that haven't seen the trailer, Kung Lao puts the hat on the ground and it starts spinning like a circular saw and he starts grabbing Sub-Zero and pulling him towards it like he's going to rip his body in half with the saw, starting with his wiener.

01:08:32.954 --> 01:08:34.095
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, interesting.

01:08:36.076 --> 01:08:41.479
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit over the top, but I don't know, again, they're starting to get a little too realistic.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:43.660
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I liked Mortal Kombat when it was cartoony and dumb.

01:08:43.942 --> 01:08:45.865
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we're at 9, like you said.

01:08:45.905 --> 01:08:50.431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an insane amount for a lot of forgettable titles in the series.

01:08:50.652 --> 01:08:52.855
[SPEAKER_14]: I always kind of had an appreciation for Mortal Kombat.

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:55.238
[SPEAKER_14]: I always thought a lot of them were really underrated and they're a lot of fun.

01:08:55.519 --> 01:08:58.103
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just dumb fun and that's the important part of the game.

01:08:58.904 --> 01:08:59.344
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you go.

01:09:01.367 --> 01:09:04.151
[SPEAKER_14]: That is supposedly also at the E3 show floor.

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:07.435
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some big banners hanging from the ceiling teasing the new Mortal Kombat game.

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.878
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know I definitely want to stop by and check that out.

01:09:09.898 --> 01:09:10.799
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if we can get one.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you could prop me up and I'll... No, the banner.

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:16.646
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop me up and I'll take it down and we'll steal it.

01:09:16.666 --> 01:09:20.350
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the show floor is like... Or the ceiling is, you know...

01:09:21.051 --> 01:09:21.631
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:48.222
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's move on to some release dates.

01:09:48.282 --> 01:09:53.143
[SPEAKER_14]: Travel around the world and talk about what is coming out soon to a retail store near you.

01:09:53.283 --> 01:09:56.264
[SPEAKER_14]: We go to the UK and the US and Japan.

01:09:56.284 --> 01:09:57.725
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to start off with Loki in the US.

01:09:58.805 --> 01:10:03.927
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you know it's going to be a wonderful week since the biggest title coming out this week is Toy Story 3.

01:10:05.127 --> 01:10:10.809
[SPEAKER_11]: Toy Story 3 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP and PC.

01:10:12.702 --> 01:10:13.902
[SPEAKER_11]: And now the rest of the crap.

01:10:14.683 --> 01:10:18.023
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's play Garden, coming out on DS this week.

01:10:18.604 --> 01:10:22.405
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the Wii, let's play Ballerina, coming out on DS and the Wii.

01:10:22.705 --> 01:10:24.205
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's play Ballerina!

01:10:24.225 --> 01:10:25.145
[SPEAKER_11]: 100 classic books.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:29.626
[SPEAKER_11]: The only game released on the DS that actually wasn't rated by the ESRB.

01:10:29.787 --> 01:10:31.647
[SPEAKER_11]: The most boring video game ever made.

01:10:31.667 --> 01:10:32.827
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's books.

01:10:33.768 --> 01:10:36.508
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'd be a great, great $20 spent.

01:10:36.828 --> 01:10:38.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game called Let's Go to the Library.

01:10:39.828 --> 01:10:42.951
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of K coming to the Nintendo DS.

01:10:43.931 --> 01:10:47.534
[SPEAKER_11]: XGBlast, supposed to be like a shmup game, coming to the Nintendo DS.

01:10:48.775 --> 01:10:52.878
[SPEAKER_11]: Superbike World Championship, SBK, coming to the PS3.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:53.799
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a budget game.

01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:56.441
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

01:10:56.521 --> 01:10:57.822
[SPEAKER_11]: Kid Adventure Sky Captain.

01:10:58.082 --> 01:10:59.122
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, this one looks okay.

01:10:59.162 --> 01:11:00.983
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like Pilotwings on the Wii.

01:11:01.204 --> 01:11:02.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Also only a budget game.

01:11:03.045 --> 01:11:06.167
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this is the kind of stuff that Konami keeps putting out.

01:11:06.247 --> 01:11:07.147
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Konami.

01:11:07.187 --> 01:11:07.888
[SPEAKER_11]: You're wonderful.

01:11:07.988 --> 01:11:10.129
[SPEAKER_11]: Yard Sale, Hidden Treasures, Sunnyville.

01:11:10.529 --> 01:11:13.531
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess where you're going to find this game in a yard sale.

01:11:13.551 --> 01:11:13.811
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, wait.

01:11:13.971 --> 01:11:14.592
[SPEAKER_14]: Sunnyvale?

01:11:15.132 --> 01:11:15.872
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunnyville.

01:11:16.092 --> 01:11:18.114
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I was going to say it's like a game set in Sunnyvale.

01:11:18.134 --> 01:11:18.694
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of cool.

01:11:18.959 --> 01:11:24.582
[SPEAKER_11]: ThinkSmart Western Riding Academy Naval Assault The Killing Tide Xbox 360

01:11:45.013 --> 01:12:11.805
[SPEAKER_11]: and another crappy game on the Wii Family Game Show which is gonna be some stupid party game by a company I've never heard of, Storm City Games and last but not least I Spy Universe, who gives a shit I don't care what system it's on the end Ray Ayanami in chat says there aren't enough games set in the SF Bay Area how about every racing game ever made always has like some type of San Francisco stage because of the hills

01:12:13.539 --> 01:12:20.748
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I will tell you, in real life, folks, you go about three miles an hour down all of those roads because there's always traffic.

01:12:20.968 --> 01:12:29.539
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to have a San Francisco level because you know San Francisco, what it's most known for, earthquakes, because every game that has a disaster in it, San Francisco has the earthquakes.

01:12:29.619 --> 01:12:31.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Cruising USA, heads.

01:12:33.277 --> 01:12:34.538
[SPEAKER_14]: Blur has a San Francisco level.

01:12:34.638 --> 01:12:35.058
[SPEAKER_14]: They all do.

01:12:35.519 --> 01:12:36.159
[SPEAKER_14]: Every single one of them.

01:12:36.199 --> 01:12:37.680
[SPEAKER_14]: Mario Kart has a San Francisco level.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:38.121
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

01:12:38.741 --> 01:12:40.422
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Toad San Francisco Adventure.

01:12:40.442 --> 01:12:43.425
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Blur, by the way, in Mario Kart, did you see that commercial?

01:12:43.605 --> 01:12:44.566
[SPEAKER_14]: It is amazing.

01:12:44.686 --> 01:12:45.927
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the best thing I've seen.

01:12:47.348 --> 01:12:53.873
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan was watching Classic Game Room and it was the leading in commercial and I laughed my butt off.

01:12:54.033 --> 01:12:54.553
[SPEAKER_14]: Good times.

01:12:55.054 --> 01:12:58.636
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you fitting your little guy in panties over there?

01:12:58.696 --> 01:13:00.758
[SPEAKER_14]: He looks like he's wearing panties, manties.

01:13:01.337 --> 01:13:10.067
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm picking his bathing suit and I'm just trying out different fabric patterns Guys don't really wear that to the beach at least in America I realize like Greece it's a little different but we're all fat

01:13:11.852 --> 01:13:13.613
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying different fabrics.

01:13:13.633 --> 01:13:14.794
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure.

01:13:14.834 --> 01:13:17.436
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Nintendo should want to make sure you were aware.

01:13:17.976 --> 01:13:19.237
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use gold sequins.

01:13:19.257 --> 01:13:19.858
[SPEAKER_11]: Gold sequins.

01:13:20.378 --> 01:13:30.145
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo should really come out with a commercial later on for its next Mario Kart game and say, yeah, Blur wants to go ahead and make fun of our games, but our game's still millions of copies.

01:13:30.525 --> 01:13:31.145
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours doesn't.

01:13:31.966 --> 01:13:32.386
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you.

01:13:33.567 --> 01:13:36.348
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes with a plate and a pillowcase and a clock

01:14:02.054 --> 01:14:03.935
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a whole big franchise out there.

01:14:03.975 --> 01:14:06.095
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually an anime based on it as well.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:09.457
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the Hakioki is coming out there on PS3.

01:14:09.477 --> 01:14:11.057
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a pretty big release over there this week.

01:14:12.658 --> 01:14:20.720
[SPEAKER_14]: Also on the other systems, going to the Nintendo Wii, Hospital 6 Nin no Ishii is coming out in Japan from Atlus.

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.221
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if this is a Trauma Center game.

01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:22.861
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's not.

01:14:22.981 --> 01:14:24.502
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's maybe a spinoff or something.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:28.223
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a different hospital game, but there is your mandatory chick with big boobs.

01:14:28.303 --> 01:14:28.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

01:14:28.763 --> 01:14:30.404
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's Trauma Center.

01:14:30.564 --> 01:14:30.964
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really?

01:14:30.984 --> 01:14:31.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the one that we just got.

01:14:31.944 --> 01:14:32.945
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like an anime or something.

01:14:32.985 --> 01:14:34.505
[SPEAKER_04]: The characters are exactly the same.

01:14:34.705 --> 01:14:35.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

01:14:35.066 --> 01:14:36.166
[SPEAKER_04]: It just looks so different.

01:14:37.186 --> 01:14:39.667
[SPEAKER_04]: Trauma Team, that's what the American one's called.

01:14:39.807 --> 01:14:40.068
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.

01:14:40.208 --> 01:14:43.169
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, maybe it's the release of Trauma Team then.

01:14:47.691 --> 01:14:50.492
[SPEAKER_14]: I define better Dark Sakura when you're showing me that guy.

01:14:50.592 --> 01:14:52.312
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Fishnet?

01:14:53.353 --> 01:14:53.753
[SPEAKER_14]: No, thank you.

01:14:54.507 --> 01:15:01.391
[SPEAKER_14]: Also on the Nintendo DS this week, Igokoro Koyushitsu comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

01:15:01.891 --> 01:15:05.293
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a game where apparently you... I don't even know what this is.

01:15:05.353 --> 01:15:08.795
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like apples on the cover with the stylus.

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:10.256
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Let's Draw Apples.

01:15:10.336 --> 01:15:11.297
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if it's a painting game.

01:15:11.457 --> 01:15:12.017
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet that's what it is.

01:15:12.037 --> 01:15:12.657
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a painting game.

01:15:13.438 --> 01:15:15.139
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's probably Let's Paint on the DS.

01:15:15.459 --> 01:15:16.339
[SPEAKER_14]: Learn how to paint apples.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:17.820
[SPEAKER_14]: Still life.

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:20.442
[SPEAKER_14]: They did have a Let's Paint game on the Wii.

01:15:20.462 --> 01:15:20.742
[SPEAKER_14]: That is...

01:15:21.186 --> 01:15:21.787
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a painting game.

01:15:23.548 --> 01:15:27.933
[SPEAKER_14]: And then lastly on the PSP, nothing this week.

01:15:28.613 --> 01:15:32.897
[SPEAKER_14]: But next week you get Project D.Va from Sega on the PSP.

01:15:33.378 --> 01:15:34.159
[SPEAKER_14]: You have that to look forward to.

01:15:34.778 --> 01:15:36.559
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:37.940
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff.

01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:40.702
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 13th, Mytheon for PC.

01:15:41.343 --> 01:15:44.065
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 16th, we have Ancients of Uga.

01:15:44.925 --> 01:15:45.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:15:46.387 --> 01:16:00.097
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the 18th, we have Everybody's Tennis, I'm Not Alone, International Cricket 2010, Project Runway, and Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker on PSP.

01:16:01.978 --> 01:16:02.398
[SPEAKER_02]: and Amiro.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:02.518
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:16:27.935 --> 01:16:32.378
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about 3D on PS3.

01:16:33.079 --> 01:16:41.245
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, this week we actually got an update on the PS3 firmware to allow for some games to support stereoscopic 3D.

01:16:42.726 --> 01:16:50.712
[SPEAKER_11]: These games, of course, would be Wipeout HD, Pain, Super Stardust HD, and Motorstorm Pacific Rift.

01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:53.454
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a demo, apparently, with I think one level that was in 3D.

01:16:54.516 --> 01:16:57.961
[SPEAKER_11]: and White Battle wants to see if his own 3D paint has a 3D level.

01:16:59.691 --> 01:17:08.659
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was actually one of the reasons that the... Back in the day, remember when they were doing the Gorillaz holographic thing for their concerts?

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:21.791
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing the projections and everything, and they said that they had to keep sound around it at a particular level, or it would start making the light waves start jitter.

01:17:22.532 --> 01:17:24.694
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had that problem when they did with Madonna.

01:17:24.714 --> 01:17:24.794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:17:25.614 --> 01:17:43.679
[SPEAKER_02]: because when her song started in it was that heavy bass and it made the holograms jitter well being that this isn't holograms hopefully we won't have that problem but it's still a matter of sight and perception and it's still the waves themselves are still a physical thing

01:17:44.144 --> 01:17:46.526
[SPEAKER_14]: The only holograms I want to see are fronted by Jim.

01:17:47.527 --> 01:17:51.930
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this, I mean, looks kind of cool, but, you know, it's one of those things.

01:17:52.711 --> 01:18:00.617
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not buying a new damn TV, and I'm not buying, you know, expensive glasses to go with these TVs just for some of these games.

01:18:00.737 --> 01:18:05.300
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of those things where when the technology comes down in price in about five years, I think more people will have it.

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:07.702
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, I think this is a little too soon.

01:18:08.223 --> 01:18:11.045
[SPEAKER_14]: But I am so, like, over the 3D craze.

01:18:11.225 --> 01:18:11.826
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I just...

01:18:12.686 --> 01:18:18.049
[SPEAKER_14]: I see all these movies coming out in 3D, like there's the Resident Evil movie in 3D, and the new Saws movie in 3D.

01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:19.070
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't need to be in 3D.

01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:21.511
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything is in 3D, and I'm over it.

01:18:21.711 --> 01:18:22.752
[SPEAKER_14]: 3D movies make me sick.

01:18:23.412 --> 01:18:23.753
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop it.

01:18:23.973 --> 01:18:25.233
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked Avatar in 3D.

01:18:27.014 --> 01:18:30.957
[SPEAKER_14]: But Avatar, I would have felt just as fine with Avatar in 2D.

01:18:32.426 --> 01:18:34.527
[SPEAKER_02]: Having seen it both ways, I really did prefer it in 3D.

01:18:34.748 --> 01:18:35.428
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's the thing.

01:18:35.828 --> 01:18:43.993
[SPEAKER_11]: With Avatar or something like that, when they're filming that movie, it's just like a normal movie just filmed in 3D.

01:18:44.414 --> 01:18:53.980
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas a lot of people, when you film something in 3D, they want to do a lot of stuff to really capitalize on the 3D, like throw stuff at you or have you fly around really fast or something like that.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:16.640
[SPEAKER_11]: and that's great and all but it's this isn't like an amusement park ride I mean we don't really need that kind of stuff just make a good movie and that'd be it now the motion box seats that's more amusement park fare and god please do not have that trend make its way to consoles I don't need a moving couch

01:19:19.292 --> 01:19:25.937
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, another music game was announced this week that's going to be showing its way at the Florida E3 this year.

01:19:26.077 --> 01:19:27.157
[SPEAKER_14]: It's DJ Hero 2.

01:19:28.078 --> 01:19:31.420
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, some folks were saying that DJ Hero didn't really sell what they were hoping it would.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.802
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, didn't DJ Hero kind of keep selling?

01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:37.224
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, maybe it didn't sell a lot at the beginning, but it kind of has kept selling?

01:19:37.384 --> 01:19:37.945
[SPEAKER_14]: It's done okay.

01:19:38.165 --> 01:19:42.047
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for, like, a brand new franchise, you know, it did alright.

01:19:42.267 --> 01:19:49.072
[SPEAKER_11]: And considering how much they've supported their download content, in other words, not at all, I'm surprised it sold what it did.

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:53.617
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was some content released this week in celebration of DJ Hero 2.

01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:56.040
[SPEAKER_14]: They did release some free content this week.

01:19:56.761 --> 01:20:03.930
[SPEAKER_14]: It is DJ Hero 2's mix for Just Dance by Lady Gaga with Ghosts and Stuff by Deadmau5.

01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:06.813
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's listen to a little bit of it here.

01:20:18.619 --> 01:20:21.843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's alright.

01:20:22.363 --> 01:20:22.884
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds kind of fun.

01:20:23.965 --> 01:20:26.628
[SPEAKER_14]: So 70 new songs are supposed to be coming to DJ Hero 2.

01:20:27.109 --> 01:20:31.254
[SPEAKER_14]: Kanye West, Chemical Brothers, Dr. Dre, Gaga, Rihanna, Metallica.

01:20:31.775 --> 01:20:33.597
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots and lots and lots of artists are going to be in this.

01:20:34.337 --> 01:20:38.200
[SPEAKER_14]: The sequel will also be putting in microphone gameplay.

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.141
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also going to have a lot more of two turntables at once.

01:20:41.362 --> 01:20:45.364
[SPEAKER_14]: So literally you will have, yes, two turntables and a microphone.

01:20:46.104 --> 01:20:48.126
[SPEAKER_14]: How many times have you heard that joke this week?

01:20:48.146 --> 01:20:50.267
[SPEAKER_14]: They totally have to put Beck in there then.

01:20:51.278 --> 01:20:53.601
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's interesting that they have the karaoke mode in there.

01:20:53.621 --> 01:20:56.103
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's kind of cool to have an additional person playing.

01:20:57.125 --> 01:21:01.430
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if they didn't mention anything about guitar mode coming back.

01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:05.355
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering if they're going to do something special with that, if they're going to have band mode or something.

01:21:05.375 --> 01:21:06.396
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they just scrapped it.

01:21:06.656 --> 01:21:06.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Music

01:21:28.827 --> 01:21:30.069
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's really cool.

01:21:45.726 --> 01:21:47.307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so a lot more stuff.

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:56.435
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also said, you know those samples that you trigger and stuff, how they really have the annoying Flava Flav samples and stuff like that?

01:21:56.815 --> 01:22:00.698
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now the samples are going to be tying in with the songs instead.

01:22:00.718 --> 01:22:02.259
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to be able to choose these different sample sets.

01:22:02.279 --> 01:22:02.780
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.541
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw says I mispronounced the name of that other artist.

01:22:05.561 --> 01:22:06.462
[SPEAKER_14]: It's DeadMouse.

01:22:06.602 --> 01:22:07.543
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's not my fault.

01:22:07.603 --> 01:22:09.204
[SPEAKER_14]: He has to type all week, speak, whatever.

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:10.284
[SPEAKER_11]: He has an awesome mask.

01:22:10.304 --> 01:22:11.145
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently he's in the game.

01:22:11.985 --> 01:22:12.906
[SPEAKER_11]: He has a giant mouse head.

01:22:13.166 --> 01:22:18.590
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some more like real dancey artists or real club artists like Pendulum.

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:23.733
[SPEAKER_11]: They're supposed to be focusing it more on electronic artists this time.

01:22:23.893 --> 01:22:24.353
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope so.

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:24.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Pendulum?

01:22:25.934 --> 01:22:28.516
[SPEAKER_11]: Pendulum would be awesome.

01:22:28.736 --> 01:22:31.798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd buy the game day one more than I already will buy it day one.

01:22:31.938 --> 01:22:33.139
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm buying it day one as it is.

01:22:33.399 --> 01:22:37.021
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though I don't play the first one, I still want to go back to it.

01:22:37.321 --> 01:22:43.265
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm buying that day one and seeing it with Rock Band 3 with the keyboard because I totally want to play that.

01:22:43.405 --> 01:22:54.953
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they'll improve the turntable at all because there were so many people that were having problems with buttons stop working and I have problems with the scratching doesn't always trigger.

01:22:55.498 --> 01:22:57.579
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a little tricky sometimes.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:22:59.380
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:05.282
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a, what was it, a beta controller and I also have a regular controller.

01:23:06.203 --> 01:23:07.223
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a wired controller.

01:23:08.061 --> 01:23:08.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

01:23:08.742 --> 01:23:12.305
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have the Wired360 one from the demo we had.

01:23:12.345 --> 01:23:13.266
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:13.346 --> 01:23:13.906
[SPEAKER_11]: Demo controller.

01:23:14.127 --> 01:23:14.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:23:15.928 --> 01:23:16.629
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, folks.

01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:22.775
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, believe it or not, before we get to the end of Part A, I have to break, guys, because we do have some special news.

01:23:23.235 --> 01:23:23.695
All right.

01:23:32.150 --> 01:23:32.830
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.231
[SPEAKER_14]: We break for this special news report here.

01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:41.414
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, this comes to us thanks to Twitter, and Bobby sent this along and alerted me to what's going on here.

01:23:41.834 --> 01:23:45.815
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, the event is starting to get underway, the whole kinetic event.

01:23:46.275 --> 01:23:49.657
[SPEAKER_14]: They have forced the entire audience to wear ponchos.

01:23:51.257 --> 01:23:55.118
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all in these metallic poncho-looking things.

01:23:55.818 --> 01:24:01.580
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, the Xbox event will involve a splash zone or something.

01:24:01.740 --> 01:24:04.421
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the hell is going on.

01:24:04.441 --> 01:24:07.522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be they're hitting watermelons and talls.

01:24:07.702 --> 01:24:09.282
[SPEAKER_14]: They're repeating this Monday night.

01:24:10.343 --> 01:24:10.863
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing.

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:14.644
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov and I actually had the opportunity to go to this event, but a day late.

01:24:15.444 --> 01:24:18.266
[SPEAKER_14]: because they're redoing it tomorrow night and we were like, that's okay.

01:24:19.447 --> 01:24:21.649
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I'm really feeling that was a good idea.

01:24:21.809 --> 01:24:22.190
[SPEAKER_04]: I would.

01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:25.152
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks fun because I don't know.

01:24:25.172 --> 01:24:27.094
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to get watermelon on me or something.

01:24:27.114 --> 01:24:30.376
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you get to keep these little shoulder pad poncho things?

01:24:30.436 --> 01:24:33.159
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody looks so happy in the pictures to be wearing them.

01:24:33.179 --> 01:24:36.962
[SPEAKER_14]: They're probably like, oh my God, I'm going to be a TV with this.

01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:41.032
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not even joking.

01:24:41.092 --> 01:24:42.293
[SPEAKER_14]: Bobby, post a link in chat.

01:24:42.334 --> 01:24:42.994
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're listening.

01:24:43.034 --> 01:24:43.555
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

01:24:43.995 --> 01:24:44.576
[SPEAKER_14]: Good stuff.

01:24:45.417 --> 01:24:46.258
[SPEAKER_14]: Big silver.

01:24:47.039 --> 01:24:49.862
[SPEAKER_14]: But if everybody in the audience is wearing that, it's gonna look weird on TV.

01:24:51.377 --> 01:24:52.497
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I was thinking though?

01:24:52.698 --> 01:24:57.739
[SPEAKER_11]: I was making the joke, I'm like, you know how these camera games just really suck and they don't work very well?

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.380
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, is that what I need to wear?

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's gonna come packaged in.

01:25:01.521 --> 01:25:04.702
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know how they had like, what is it, the stupid jumpsuits and stuff?

01:25:04.742 --> 01:25:10.684
[SPEAKER_11]: So, apparently the Kinect only works if you're wearing like a silly costume.

01:25:11.184 --> 01:25:12.545
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all silly costumes only.

01:25:14.747 --> 01:25:21.892
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we are getting to the end here of Part A on our show, but you know we cannot call it quits until we get to one more segment.

01:25:21.912 --> 01:25:25.835
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to do this segment every week, because if we don't, DarkSakura finds me down and threatens to kill me.

01:25:26.195 --> 01:25:27.055
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes she does.

01:25:27.716 --> 01:25:28.597
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the Classic Game of the Week!

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.164
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's gonna dive into the vault and find a game she thinks you kids ought to be playing this week and respecting.

01:25:39.624 --> 01:25:42.306
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:25:42.901 --> 01:25:45.363
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's classic game is Magician Lord.

01:25:46.044 --> 01:25:50.247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally walked into the vault and what's the first game I see?

01:25:50.407 --> 01:25:51.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Magician Lord.

01:25:51.368 --> 01:25:51.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:25:52.589 --> 01:25:53.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a Neo Geo game.

01:25:54.771 --> 01:25:58.914
[SPEAKER_02]: It was developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK.

01:25:59.595 --> 01:26:03.498
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a Neo Geo arcade in the home systems and a virtual console.

01:26:03.518 --> 01:26:04.078
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out in 1994.

01:26:06.491 --> 01:26:17.833
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is a platform game, and it actually was one of the pack-ins for the Neo Geo AES, so that's probably why I have a copy.

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:23.794
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's about this wizard named Elta, who is the last magician lord going to save his homeland.

01:26:24.894 --> 01:26:31.035
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go through and you get different spheres that will give you different abilities.

01:26:31.396 --> 01:26:33.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:41.993
[SPEAKER_02]: He can jump and shoot and climb and do all kinds of stuff and he, you know, those fire and he cosplays every time he gets a sphere.

01:26:42.373 --> 01:26:44.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, he actually gets different abilities with each sphere.

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.402
[SPEAKER_02]: He also walks really funny.

01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:51.950
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if he walks fast, he still looks like he's prancing, kind of.

01:26:52.410 --> 01:26:57.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just, like, he's climbing a ladder right now, but you just have to look at him walk.

01:26:57.872 --> 01:26:58.052
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

01:26:58.652 --> 01:27:01.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's in, never mind, he looks funny when he's in human form.

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:05.554
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so he got, has a dragon warrior form.

01:27:05.574 --> 01:27:11.076
[SPEAKER_02]: He breathes fire, and it's a continuous short-range attack, and you can aim it diagonally.

01:27:11.856 --> 01:27:18.380
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Waterman, where there's water grenades that are blue bubbles that explode into water pillars.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:22.222
[SPEAKER_02]: Which sounds kind of like Caterpillar, but not.

01:27:23.902 --> 01:27:26.664
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's Poseidon, which is a more powerful Waterman.

01:27:27.064 --> 01:27:30.606
[SPEAKER_02]: So he shoots waves of water and has a lot of damage.

01:27:30.666 --> 01:27:34.128
[SPEAKER_02]: And he can freeze enemies and shatter on impact.

01:27:34.948 --> 01:27:36.669
[SPEAKER_02]: And moves very slowly.

01:27:37.443 --> 01:27:44.233
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shinobi is more agile and has powerful magic arcs of fire.

01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:45.715
[SPEAKER_02]: They are wide but slow moving.

01:27:45.835 --> 01:27:53.265
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Samurai who can attack through barriers such as walls, shields, multiple enemies with a boomerang-like energy attack.

01:27:53.906 --> 01:28:01.953
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Raijin, who gives Elta the ability to jump a lot better and has an electrical field around his body.

01:28:03.334 --> 01:28:06.776
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's because Raijin is an electric person.

01:28:07.557 --> 01:28:08.658
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the game.

01:28:08.738 --> 01:28:11.140
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that he just walks really funny.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of prancy funny.

01:28:13.201 --> 01:28:13.482
[SPEAKER_14]: He does.

01:28:13.542 --> 01:28:14.462
[SPEAKER_14]: He prances a little bit.

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.063
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of funny.

01:28:15.103 --> 01:28:17.405
[SPEAKER_02]: I like his stylish blue hat.

01:28:18.464 --> 01:28:20.125
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:28:45.205 --> 01:28:50.269
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we are going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't worry guys, we'll be right back with plenty more.

01:28:50.289 --> 01:28:54.713
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get to your phone calls tonight, of course, some rapid fire news, the mailbag, and all that good stuff we always do.

01:28:55.333 --> 01:29:00.758
[SPEAKER_14]: Also tonight, I've been keeping it a secret, I want to do a little something special for you guys that are listening tonight.

01:29:01.547 --> 01:29:02.007
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio

01:29:35.646 --> 01:29:40.510
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, June the 13th of 2010.

01:29:41.932 --> 01:29:51.860
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had a lot of busy, busy E3 pre-news tonight and lots of breaking news and updates going on and all this stuff happening and will the madness never end?

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:52.981
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course not!

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.043
E3 Pre-News

01:30:00.743 --> 01:30:02.684
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Tom Brokaw with a special report

01:30:23.658 --> 01:30:31.041
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's Blizzard's own internal version of Steam slash X-Fire for their own games.

01:30:31.481 --> 01:30:37.664
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can see, like, if you have friends that play WoW on different servers, you're going to be able to talk to them on those different servers and interact with them and so forth.

01:30:38.064 --> 01:30:43.606
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's part of the catch that goes with that, is that you're going to have real names for friends.

01:30:44.127 --> 01:30:51.870
[SPEAKER_14]: Your real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing a character's profile.

01:30:52.410 --> 01:31:11.948
[SPEAKER_14]: real ID friends can also see who's on each other's real ID friends list making it easy for players to connect with other people they know I hate that I'm not going to use this I don't want people to know my full name I use a fake name here on the show I realize some people do but it's kind of one of those like you know I don't really like to advertise it I don't want to be found that easy

01:31:12.808 --> 01:31:39.858
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine that they're going to force you to use your real name that there won't be some sort of option to use a fake name also maybe they'll go by what your account name whatever you put for that and I have used multiple accounts on WoW and I have used random names I think I had to use my real name I think I might have tried to put just my last initial and that's what I would like I don't care if it's my real last initial but I don't want somebody to google my name

01:31:40.698 --> 01:31:42.141
[SPEAKER_14]: and find all my WoW characters.

01:31:42.962 --> 01:31:44.565
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially with what I named some of them, okay?

01:31:44.605 --> 01:31:47.710
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need my students at work doing that.

01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:48.371
[SPEAKER_14]: Sassy pants?

01:31:48.772 --> 01:31:49.232
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure!

01:31:51.636 --> 01:31:53.620
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, I don't know, I'm just...

01:31:54.252 --> 01:31:55.333
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of irritating.

01:31:55.353 --> 01:31:57.195
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of irritating.

01:31:57.215 --> 01:31:57.755
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of irritating.

01:32:17.685 --> 01:32:19.986
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope that can be suppressed.

01:32:20.146 --> 01:32:22.408
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope Blizzard is not that stupid.

01:32:22.908 --> 01:32:26.450
[SPEAKER_14]: Blizzard, if you're listening, I hope you are not that stupid.

01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:29.072
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll make you pay $25 to change it.

01:32:30.773 --> 01:32:31.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Will I get a pony with it?

01:32:32.014 --> 01:32:32.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

01:32:33.135 --> 01:32:33.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a pet.

01:32:34.915 --> 01:32:36.016
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more breaking news.

01:32:36.216 --> 01:32:37.998
[SPEAKER_14]: Will there be more breaking news throughout the show?

01:32:38.118 --> 01:32:38.438
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

01:32:38.458 --> 01:32:39.099
[SPEAKER_14]: It should have been a game.

01:32:39.119 --> 01:32:41.220
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, how many breaking news interruptions will there be tonight?

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.081
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a crazy night.

01:32:43.022 --> 01:32:45.444
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright guys, let's get back into some gaming news.

01:32:45.464 --> 01:32:47.045
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do some quick stories here.

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:49.667
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki and myself, Jamie's sitting out tonight because of her voice.

01:32:49.727 --> 01:32:51.189
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, go ahead and let's get to some quick news.

01:32:52.530 --> 01:32:57.176
[SPEAKER_11]: Portal 2, just like the party that they were going to have for Portal 2.

01:32:58.157 --> 01:32:58.798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been delayed.

01:32:59.739 --> 01:33:01.161
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the party got canceled.

01:33:01.802 --> 01:33:02.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Game delayed, though.

01:33:03.064 --> 01:33:04.205
[SPEAKER_11]: Not coming out until 2011, and that's too bad.

01:33:04.225 --> 01:33:04.385
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well.

01:33:08.905 --> 01:33:17.753
[SPEAKER_11]: Game though that is coming out over here, also in 2011, which is kind of a surprise seeing as the last game hasn't sold very well at all.

01:33:19.634 --> 01:33:25.519
[SPEAKER_11]: Yakuza 4 is slated to be heading to North America and Europe in Spring 2011.

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:30.043
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully they do not cut out a ton of stuff like they did with Yakuza 3.

01:33:30.083 --> 01:33:30.123
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

01:33:33.766 --> 01:33:41.308
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy 9 is making its way to PlayStation Network next week.

01:33:43.588 --> 01:33:46.569
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, 9 was my least favorite on the PlayStation.

01:33:46.649 --> 01:33:49.530
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, if you still want to buy it, it's only going to be $10.

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:53.611
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you forget about Final Fantasy 8?

01:33:54.437 --> 01:33:55.298
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great game.

01:33:55.678 --> 01:33:57.620
[SPEAKER_14]: A great game to make fun of.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:58.981
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked 8 better than 9.

01:33:59.262 --> 01:34:00.343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 9 is terrible.

01:34:00.363 --> 01:34:01.684
[SPEAKER_14]: What is wrong with you people?

01:34:02.705 --> 01:34:05.688
[SPEAKER_04]: Avivi was cool, and Quina was funny, and the game sucked.

01:34:08.137 --> 01:34:09.698
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing a show with insane people.

01:34:29.707 --> 01:34:31.608
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't say when it's supposed to end.

01:34:31.908 --> 01:34:33.669
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm guessing sometime next week.

01:34:34.689 --> 01:34:36.030
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that's hours and not days.

01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:38.611
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:34:39.672 --> 01:34:42.493
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, during E3 would kind of be the time to do it.

01:34:42.693 --> 01:34:44.614
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the Japanese site.

01:34:45.315 --> 01:34:46.155
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting, though.

01:34:46.175 --> 01:34:47.896
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's going to have online multiplayer.

01:34:47.956 --> 01:34:53.179
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, if they're doing a beta test, it's probably going to have online multiplayer because they have to stress their servers, but

01:34:54.625 --> 01:34:54.965
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:34:55.346 --> 01:34:57.467
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really seeing anything on the countdown site.

01:34:57.527 --> 01:35:11.538
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, if you want to check it out, it's www.jp.playstation.com S-C-E-J slash Marusen M-A-R-U-S-E-N It's down to 86, so it must be ours.

01:35:11.899 --> 01:35:12.799
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's ours.

01:35:12.899 --> 01:35:16.022
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would probably be sometime this week during E3.

01:35:16.942 --> 01:35:19.064
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps their press conference time?

01:35:19.324 --> 01:35:19.584
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe?

01:35:19.725 --> 01:35:19.945
[SPEAKER_11]: Around?

01:35:19.965 --> 01:35:20.465
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

01:35:20.845 --> 01:35:21.466
[SPEAKER_14]: About three days?

01:35:21.506 --> 01:35:21.926
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, maybe.

01:35:22.367 --> 01:35:22.667
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

01:35:23.598 --> 01:35:25.921
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, moving on to some other news.

01:35:26.061 --> 01:35:26.982
[SPEAKER_14]: Puzzle Quest.

01:35:27.122 --> 01:35:28.724
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the news keeps coming on Puzzle Quest.

01:35:29.004 --> 01:35:29.785
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, this is great.

01:35:29.845 --> 01:35:34.210
[SPEAKER_14]: Chapters 1 and 2 are free on the iPhone right now.

01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:37.614
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want to grab a free Puzzle Quest, you got to do it right now.

01:35:37.974 --> 01:35:41.097
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how long this is available for, but I believe it's just the weekend.

01:35:41.137 --> 01:35:45.102
[SPEAKER_14]: So unfortunately, those of you listening to the podcast Monday morning, this sale may already be over.

01:35:45.442 --> 01:35:48.965
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, chapters 1 and 2 of Puzzle Quest, they split it up on the iPhone.

01:35:49.505 --> 01:35:50.466
[SPEAKER_14]: It's free right now.

01:35:50.867 --> 01:35:56.331
[SPEAKER_14]: Now if you actually get all the way to the third chapter, it's going to cost you $1.99 for the third chapter.

01:35:57.252 --> 01:35:58.673
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it going to hold your attention that long?

01:35:58.913 --> 01:36:00.735
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to the training dummy and then I stopped.

01:36:01.764 --> 01:36:06.367
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, it's a little wonky on the iPhone because I did play that a little bit.

01:36:06.707 --> 01:36:12.350
[SPEAKER_14]: And my problem with it on the iPhone is that it's just that my 3G is not built to play a game like that.

01:36:12.491 --> 01:36:15.973
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be better on that new iPhone 4 or whatever's coming out in a couple weeks.

01:36:15.993 --> 01:36:17.994
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a 3GS, so I'll see how it does on mine.

01:36:18.014 --> 01:36:19.175
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll probably do a little better with yours.

01:36:19.915 --> 01:36:20.996
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you think about the iPhone 4?

01:36:22.677 --> 01:36:23.217
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks amazing.

01:36:23.237 --> 01:36:25.138
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you really want to get in that discussion, Loki?

01:36:25.238 --> 01:36:25.718
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sure.

01:36:26.799 --> 01:36:28.099
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get one, absolutely.

01:36:28.899 --> 01:36:37.483
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm one of those people where my contract is up in October usually, so I get the whole retro deal or whatever from AT&T where I can't upgrade and it's coming out right in time for my birthday.

01:36:37.923 --> 01:36:39.784
[SPEAKER_14]: But I need a faster phone.

01:36:39.844 --> 01:36:44.245
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the apps are really hurting on the old phone and just for the technology to catch up.

01:36:44.285 --> 01:36:46.226
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the idea of a front-facing camera.

01:36:46.246 --> 01:36:47.927
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the video conferencing is going to be fun.

01:36:48.847 --> 01:36:50.508
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be a fun little toy to have.

01:36:50.528 --> 01:36:51.228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

01:36:51.448 --> 01:36:54.271
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you think about the motion controllers or the new stuff?

01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:55.232
[SPEAKER_14]: With Gyroscope?

01:36:55.412 --> 01:36:56.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to get Lair on it.

01:36:56.834 --> 01:36:58.636
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm curious to see how it's going to be implemented.

01:36:58.976 --> 01:37:03.381
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm a little worried, though, because I know I'm going to get these video phone calls from Miklatov.

01:37:03.682 --> 01:37:05.043
[SPEAKER_14]: And Miklatov's going to call me on video.

01:37:05.063 --> 01:37:07.166
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to be like, look, my Pokemon evolved.

01:37:07.826 --> 01:37:08.207
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I want...

01:37:08.747 --> 01:37:11.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's adorable, will I do that?

01:37:11.068 --> 01:37:11.829
[SPEAKER_14]: He'll totally do it.

01:37:11.989 --> 01:37:13.289
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll only do it when I get black and white.

01:37:13.389 --> 01:37:15.310
[SPEAKER_14]: And video editing on live.

01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:17.691
[SPEAKER_14]: The HD camera thing is pretty cool.

01:37:18.131 --> 01:37:20.152
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually surprised you of all people asked this, Loki.

01:37:21.093 --> 01:37:22.433
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you interested in this photo?

01:37:22.453 --> 01:37:27.936
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was watching the live blog because there was really nothing going on this week.

01:37:28.516 --> 01:37:31.218
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was kind of like my...

01:37:33.499 --> 01:37:38.724
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess preparation for the live blogs and conferences and stuff like that that are coming this week.

01:37:39.224 --> 01:37:40.325
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of the prep course.

01:37:41.106 --> 01:37:41.587
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

01:37:42.127 --> 01:37:45.210
[SPEAKER_14]: I just stopped listening to this show because Bobby sent me a link here on Twitter.

01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:46.231
[SPEAKER_14]: Another twit pic.

01:37:46.531 --> 01:37:49.474
[SPEAKER_14]: That is Itagaki in a space poncho.

01:37:50.134 --> 01:37:52.637
[SPEAKER_14]: I need a LiveJournal icon of this immediately.

01:37:52.877 --> 01:37:53.998
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, can you help?

01:37:54.639 --> 01:37:57.361
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Itagaki in the space poncho.

01:37:57.581 --> 01:37:58.182
[SPEAKER_14]: Send it to me.

01:37:58.562 --> 01:38:13.964
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Poncho Itagaki That's all you need I love it, he's kind of looking up like Behold, the future is in my poncho Oh, this is great I'm sorry, I'm having to distract Shane for a moment

01:38:14.437 --> 01:38:18.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps we can... I had to show him my favorite car ever.

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.761
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is genius.

01:38:19.781 --> 01:38:21.963
[SPEAKER_14]: They're getting all these celebrities to put on space ponchos.

01:38:21.983 --> 01:38:22.303
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at this.

01:38:22.323 --> 01:38:22.603
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at this.

01:38:22.643 --> 01:38:24.044
[SPEAKER_14]: Felicia Day in a space poncho.

01:38:24.084 --> 01:38:24.504
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

01:38:24.544 --> 01:38:25.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me the Itagaki.

01:38:25.885 --> 01:38:26.866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make you... I just did.

01:38:26.926 --> 01:38:28.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Check your private message.

01:38:28.147 --> 01:38:31.529
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make one of him in the ponchos as space rock star.

01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:35.973
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you want to know something or kind of a funny game we should play?

01:38:36.433 --> 01:38:39.795
[SPEAKER_11]: How much will these space ponchos go for on eBay?

01:38:40.356 --> 01:38:41.777
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they're covered in watermelon.

01:38:44.577 --> 01:38:48.598
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it's probably just going to be some sort of light showing or reflect off the space poncho.

01:38:48.618 --> 01:38:52.199
[SPEAKER_14]: They better, like, make you turn those in on the way out because they have another show tomorrow night.

01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:54.320
[SPEAKER_14]: We could have worn the space ponchos.

01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:56.261
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you don't go to work, we still can.

01:38:56.281 --> 01:38:57.661
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have laughed at you.

01:38:58.802 --> 01:39:00.262
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been like, we could take this.

01:39:00.382 --> 01:39:00.962
[SPEAKER_04]: We could take this.

01:39:01.122 --> 01:39:02.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha ha ha ha.

01:39:02.583 --> 01:39:03.023
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

01:39:03.643 --> 01:39:06.645
[SPEAKER_04]: We could take emo pictures like the first few people that had them.

01:39:07.005 --> 01:39:08.986
[SPEAKER_14]: Ditch work or space poncho.

01:39:09.166 --> 01:39:11.308
[SPEAKER_14]: Ditch work or space poncho.

01:39:12.388 --> 01:39:14.169
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a tough call.

01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:15.330
[SPEAKER_14]: Those would be the same thing.

01:39:15.970 --> 01:39:17.611
[SPEAKER_14]: Work or space poncho.

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:24.475
[SPEAKER_11]: The only way that this could possibly be cooler is if they had Conan O'Brien there and he just starts doing...

01:39:25.095 --> 01:39:25.916
[SPEAKER_11]: In the year 2000!

01:39:26.136 --> 01:39:29.779
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that would be awesome.

01:39:29.959 --> 01:39:34.443
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they're branded at all, and if they don't make you turn them in, they could probably go for a lot on eBay.

01:39:34.463 --> 01:39:36.405
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably like the glasses after Captain EO.

01:39:36.425 --> 01:39:41.449
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be a large man standing there making you deposit them in the bin, or he will ref you up.

01:39:41.549 --> 01:39:42.050
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that?

01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:43.931
[SPEAKER_14]: Captain EO at Disneyland?

01:39:44.292 --> 01:39:45.793
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience thing?

01:39:46.233 --> 01:39:47.194
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing was weird.

01:39:47.234 --> 01:39:51.958
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, imagine that with an 80s movie starring Michael Jackson.

01:39:52.058 --> 01:39:53.499
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the greatest motion picture ever made.

01:39:53.859 --> 01:39:55.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that for a second.

01:39:56.721 --> 01:39:57.342
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming back.

01:39:57.842 --> 01:39:58.242
[SPEAKER_14]: It's there.

01:39:58.543 --> 01:39:59.483
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw it a couple weeks ago.

01:39:59.583 --> 01:40:00.044
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.323
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought it back after Michael Jackson kicked it.

01:40:04.984 --> 01:40:05.164
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:40:06.005 --> 01:40:07.066
[SPEAKER_11]: After he beat it?

01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:11.691
[SPEAKER_11]: After they realized that Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, wait, we haven't done that in a long time.

01:40:11.812 --> 01:40:17.098
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was pretty fun because it had Eric Idle in it.

01:40:18.103 --> 01:40:29.570
[SPEAKER_14]: BobbyBlackWolf in our chatroom Bobby is pointing out Usually you can keep stuff from MS Press conferences I still have the ass cushion they gave us in 2007 It's in my garage What was that used for?

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:41.157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I noticed 360 gives you hemorrhoids Well, if that's the same There was the one that was This 360 is so great, my anus is flaring

01:40:41.838 --> 01:40:48.812
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the 360 dealie where they had us with the headphones.

01:40:50.035 --> 01:40:51.939
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't let us keep the headphones, but they were expensive.

01:40:53.666 --> 01:40:57.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these are from the future, these space ponchos, so they might be expensive too.

01:40:57.388 --> 01:41:02.211
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I called in sick to work tomorrow, I might get in trouble and get a write-up, but I would get a space poncho.

01:41:02.451 --> 01:41:03.452
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be worth it.

01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:05.273
[SPEAKER_14]: But see, here's the sick thing.

01:41:05.433 --> 01:41:12.057
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think I have a couple co-workers who listen to this show now, and the bad thing is I'm actually legitimately getting sick.

01:41:12.597 --> 01:41:15.919
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I do call in to work tomorrow, it's not for space poncho, it's because I'm sick.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:21.143
[SPEAKER_14]: But now they're going to go around telling people, oh, if you listen to Rob's show, he called in sick because he wants to go get a space poncho.

01:41:22.003 --> 01:41:22.823
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they'll understand.

01:41:22.843 --> 01:41:23.624
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fucked either way.

01:41:26.845 --> 01:41:28.406
[SPEAKER_14]: No, actually, my coworkers are pretty cool.

01:41:29.186 --> 01:41:32.128
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd be like, as long as you wear it to work.

01:41:32.428 --> 01:41:37.130
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of my coworkers are like, you do a radio show?

01:41:38.170 --> 01:41:39.711
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if I could wear that to work.

01:41:40.451 --> 01:41:41.492
[SPEAKER_04]: A space poncho?

01:41:41.552 --> 01:41:42.132
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:41:42.752 --> 01:41:44.773
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worn Santa hats before.

01:41:44.793 --> 01:41:46.434
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see how that's any different.

01:41:46.894 --> 01:41:49.956
[SPEAKER_14]: You should just come back from LA and show up to work on your space poncho.

01:41:49.976 --> 01:41:57.021
[SPEAKER_11]: What you need to do is you need to go around E3 gathering parts to this grand costume that you will wear through E3.

01:41:57.181 --> 01:42:01.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's going to be mostly lanyards probably.

01:42:02.044 --> 01:42:03.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Lanyards and space ponchos.

01:42:04.005 --> 01:42:07.888
[SPEAKER_14]: BlackWolfInChat says, I've never heard that they're doing this event again though, but we have an invite.

01:42:07.908 --> 01:42:09.729
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we have tickets for tomorrow.

01:42:10.049 --> 01:42:11.050
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but we're just not going.

01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:12.171
[SPEAKER_14]: But now I kind of want to.

01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:14.652
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go grab a space poncho and leave.

01:42:15.173 --> 01:42:15.793
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, that's a good idea.

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:18.240
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what it is.

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:20.002
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a repeat for fans or something, right?

01:42:20.022 --> 01:42:23.506
[SPEAKER_14]: It was going to be a higher Cirque du Soleil and the blackout on TV is until Tuesday.

01:42:23.546 --> 01:42:24.367
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's a reason for it.

01:42:24.387 --> 01:42:26.089
[SPEAKER_14]: They're probably doing fans tomorrow or something.

01:42:26.383 --> 01:42:35.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was something through, I guess, the campus that they're holding it on, and they were giving away tickets to the public, and we scored a couple.

01:42:36.429 --> 01:42:36.889
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

01:42:37.289 --> 01:42:37.850
[SPEAKER_04]: Space poncho.

01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.590
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:42.672
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, we were supposed to be doing news, and Black Wolf says, are you sure it's tomorrow?

01:42:42.772 --> 01:42:46.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a hundred times, because this is the same question Rob asked me.

01:42:47.555 --> 01:42:49.656
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I put him through the whole interrogation too.

01:42:49.676 --> 01:42:52.516
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, okay, well, are you sure it's not Sunday?

01:42:53.377 --> 01:42:56.938
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, it's Monday at the same place, so it's not the press conference.

01:42:56.958 --> 01:43:00.439
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same place, and it's called the Natal reveal or whatever.

01:43:00.559 --> 01:43:06.560
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not, I'm sure I would have gotten a text about it now saying, oh, crap, you guys, it's tonight, not tomorrow.

01:43:07.041 --> 01:43:07.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

01:43:08.201 --> 01:43:11.122
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what that's all about, but they're doing it.

01:43:12.782 --> 01:43:14.283
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf's like, are you sure?

01:43:14.664 --> 01:43:15.424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw that.

01:43:15.905 --> 01:43:22.049
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm as sure as I can be without actually being there and seeing the tickets, but my contact, you know, I trust.

01:43:22.369 --> 01:43:25.231
[SPEAKER_14]: Nikolatov in a space poncho says, yes, it's true.

01:43:25.751 --> 01:43:26.412
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, anyway.

01:43:27.312 --> 01:43:28.513
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you're positive?

01:43:28.573 --> 01:43:29.794
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, come on, let's move on.

01:43:30.214 --> 01:43:31.195
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, other stuff.

01:43:31.235 --> 01:43:33.116
[SPEAKER_14]: Civilization V has a release date.

01:43:33.156 --> 01:43:33.796
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

01:43:34.197 --> 01:43:36.979
[SPEAKER_14]: September 21st is when Civ V is coming out in North America.

01:43:37.079 --> 01:43:41.261
[SPEAKER_14]: 24th is when it will come out internationally, which means it will be pirated internationally on the 21st.

01:43:43.503 --> 01:43:46.266
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the civilization that has hexagons in it, basically.

01:43:46.306 --> 01:43:48.068
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be more information at E3 next week.

01:43:48.108 --> 01:43:50.951
[SPEAKER_14]: You know I'm going to be checking this out because I loves me some civilization.

01:43:52.119 --> 01:43:55.862
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Duke Nukem Manhattan Project is real.

01:43:55.922 --> 01:43:58.964
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming to Xbox Live for $10 on June 23rd.

01:43:59.004 --> 01:44:00.585
[SPEAKER_14]: A little trailer hit the internet this week.

01:44:01.225 --> 01:44:04.087
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe, what, this is a 2D game, right?

01:44:04.167 --> 01:44:06.129
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is actually kind of retro graphics.

01:44:06.389 --> 01:44:09.571
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's 3D, but it's a 2D side-scroller action game.

01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:11.893
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of where the 2D games are going these days, right?

01:44:11.913 --> 01:44:15.235
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a beat-em-up.

01:44:15.295 --> 01:44:17.897
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get your match this time, Nukem World.

01:44:18.397 --> 01:44:20.098
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool, but it's not Duke Nukem Forever.

01:44:20.759 --> 01:44:24.081
[SPEAKER_14]: That's still kind of neat, because if you remember, Duke Nukem's roots were a 2D game.

01:44:24.101 --> 01:44:25.162
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of people forget that.

01:44:25.202 --> 01:44:26.943
[SPEAKER_14]: Duke Nukem was a 2D game first.

01:44:27.203 --> 01:44:28.924
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's my Halloween Harry remake?

01:44:29.645 --> 01:44:31.346
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good day to die.

01:44:33.067 --> 01:44:34.048
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, good stuff.

01:44:34.068 --> 01:44:37.430
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember, and since this isn't our show role, I'll talk about it.

01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:47.797
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember there was a lawsuit filed against the people working on Duke Nukem Forever because they took too damn long, and that's been settled.

01:44:48.277 --> 01:44:50.978
[SPEAKER_11]: and perhaps Duke Nukem News in the future, maybe?

01:44:52.158 --> 01:44:52.518
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know.

01:44:52.578 --> 01:44:56.099
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually... I don't know if we can get into that later.

01:44:56.319 --> 01:44:56.620
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:58.780
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, no, no, we're not.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:03.882
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, one other thing, kind of going back to when we were talking about Rock Band 3.

01:45:05.002 --> 01:45:15.449
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also, remember, a lawsuit against MTV Games and Harmonix for Rock Band from Gibson.

01:45:15.850 --> 01:45:19.992
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's been settled because you know who's making the Super Pro guitar controller?

01:45:20.593 --> 01:45:21.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Gibson.

01:45:24.557 --> 01:45:25.677
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a random game.

01:45:25.798 --> 01:45:29.139
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Dimension Game Neptune apparently is a new game coming out.

01:45:29.179 --> 01:45:30.520
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Japanese role-playing game.

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.861
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about game consoles who transform into anime girls.

01:45:34.641 --> 01:45:35.662
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not making this up.

01:45:36.202 --> 01:45:40.084
[SPEAKER_14]: It stars such people as Purple Heart, Green Heart, White Heart, and Black Heart.

01:45:40.124 --> 01:45:41.624
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so imaginative.

01:45:42.304 --> 01:45:46.626
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to fight Magikon, which I guess is the villain in the game.

01:45:47.046 --> 01:45:50.428
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically like an R4 device type thing.

01:45:50.908 --> 01:45:53.290
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's Nippon Ichi who does Disgaea.

01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:54.131
[SPEAKER_14]: They are part of this.

01:45:54.171 --> 01:45:55.392
[SPEAKER_14]: So is Compile Heart.

01:45:55.752 --> 01:45:57.174
[SPEAKER_14]: They do Agarest Reward.

01:45:58.115 --> 01:45:59.215
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of interesting things there.

01:45:59.516 --> 01:46:02.719
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, classic Sega characters are supposed to show up in the game.

01:46:02.819 --> 01:46:07.803
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Harrier, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd are like the summons in this game from the Nettoons.

01:46:08.083 --> 01:46:08.564
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

01:46:08.824 --> 01:46:09.925
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently, here's the thing.

01:46:10.045 --> 01:46:10.565
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this.

01:46:10.646 --> 01:46:13.348
[SPEAKER_14]: You can also use images from your PlayStation 3 photo library.

01:46:13.368 --> 01:46:13.848
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this.

01:46:13.948 --> 01:46:16.991
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a PS3 exclusive, which means region-free, kids.

01:46:17.211 --> 01:46:17.692
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm getting this.

01:46:18.132 --> 01:46:18.813
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds pretty awesome.

01:46:18.893 --> 01:46:21.856
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't the Neptune a codename for one of the Sega systems anyways?

01:46:22.797 --> 01:46:23.618
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of ironic.

01:46:23.658 --> 01:46:24.378
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was.

01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:29.884
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Dreamcast's codename.

01:46:32.106 --> 01:46:33.307
[SPEAKER_14]: Marissa Congusto in chat.

01:46:33.327 --> 01:46:33.868
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Marissa.

01:46:34.268 --> 01:46:36.571
[SPEAKER_14]: Says Gibson, referring to the earlier story.

01:46:36.631 --> 01:46:39.513
[SPEAKER_14]: Gibson, does that mean it's going to be insanely expensive and elitist?

01:46:40.214 --> 01:46:40.474
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:46:41.335 --> 01:46:41.556
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

01:46:42.895 --> 01:46:44.538
[SPEAKER_14]: Big announcements out of one studio here locally, right?

01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:57.263
[SPEAKER_11]: Telltale Games has announced that they're going to be doing some more episodic games.

01:46:58.084 --> 01:47:02.266
[SPEAKER_11]: One franchise they are now going to be creating games for is Jurassic Park.

01:47:02.806 --> 01:47:14.193
[SPEAKER_11]: They have struck a deal with NBCUniversal to develop games based on the MediaGiant's properties and Michael Crichton's Dinosaurs in Modern Day franchise being the first to get the interactive treatment.

01:47:15.465 --> 01:47:21.851
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if since they've striked a deal with NBCUniversal, if we'll get an office game or something like that.

01:47:22.032 --> 01:47:24.094
[SPEAKER_04]: An episodic office thing?

01:47:24.174 --> 01:47:25.775
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really like this music a lot.

01:47:25.955 --> 01:47:31.521
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the music in Jurassic Park, which is great because it's such a terrorist movie.

01:47:31.641 --> 01:47:35.285
[SPEAKER_14]: Not actually about terrorists, but those dinosaurs rip people in half.

01:47:35.605 --> 01:47:36.506
[SPEAKER_14]: And listen to the music.

01:47:39.963 --> 01:47:41.223
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you ever read the book?

01:47:41.724 --> 01:47:42.064
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

01:47:42.304 --> 01:47:44.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, believe it or not, I read the original Jurassic Park book.

01:47:44.325 --> 01:47:45.285
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you read The Lost World?

01:47:45.385 --> 01:47:47.446
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not read The Lost World, but I did see the movie.

01:47:47.526 --> 01:47:50.387
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I thought it was weird that he made a book sequel to a movie.

01:47:50.727 --> 01:47:52.988
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, like, different characters died in the original book.

01:47:53.008 --> 01:47:53.188
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

01:47:53.488 --> 01:47:56.389
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, everybody died in the original book.

01:47:56.449 --> 01:47:59.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, my favorite character in the book died, and then he's suddenly back.

01:48:00.631 --> 01:48:02.251
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a six-month thing on spoilers.

01:48:02.271 --> 01:48:03.392
[SPEAKER_14]: After six months, it's okay.

01:48:03.412 --> 01:48:05.752
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, how long ago was that book written?

01:48:05.792 --> 01:48:06.153
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, in the 80s?

01:48:06.173 --> 01:48:06.313
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

01:48:09.161 --> 01:48:12.482
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a very interesting franchise to bring back, don't you think?

01:48:12.502 --> 01:48:18.344
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they should do more movies, to be honest, because, granted, the third movie sucked, but, hey, we're past that now.

01:48:18.384 --> 01:48:21.925
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been countless number of years, well, not countless, but a lot of years.

01:48:21.965 --> 01:48:24.286
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't the fourth one kind of, like, held up in the works for a while?

01:48:24.426 --> 01:48:35.510
[SPEAKER_11]: But they should have, I mean, they had the whole thing where, oh, the ship, you know, was on autopilot and landed on the mainland or whatever, and there's dinosaurs in there, and maybe some of them escaped, and now they're breeding.

01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:38.651
[SPEAKER_11]: That would make an interesting story, you know, dinosaurs on the mainland.

01:48:40.249 --> 01:48:42.751
[SPEAKER_14]: Jurassic Park was actually kind of an awesome movie.

01:48:42.771 --> 01:48:51.314
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember when it first came out, a lot of people didn't like it, but kids our age at that time, which had been teenagers and stuff... I had my birthday party centered around it when it came out, and we didn't see it.

01:48:52.235 --> 01:48:53.995
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me tell you how long ago this movie came out.

01:48:54.015 --> 01:48:54.596
[SPEAKER_14]: You ready?

01:48:55.116 --> 01:48:57.377
[SPEAKER_14]: I went to the dollar movies with my girlfriend.

01:48:57.737 --> 01:48:59.098
[SPEAKER_14]: to see Jurassic Park.

01:48:59.218 --> 01:49:01.299
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had to hold her hand because she was so scared.

01:49:01.639 --> 01:49:07.141
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when the dinosaur is looking through like that diner door thing at one of the little girls and he snorts?

01:49:07.241 --> 01:49:09.222
[SPEAKER_14]: He snorts like she screamed.

01:49:09.462 --> 01:49:10.182
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so funny.

01:49:10.202 --> 01:49:10.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

01:49:10.603 --> 01:49:11.743
[SPEAKER_04]: Is she afraid of snorting?

01:49:11.763 --> 01:49:14.464
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think she's afraid of killer dinosaurs that will rip her in half.

01:49:14.784 --> 01:49:17.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Because remember the dinosaur like ate that guy in the toilet?

01:49:17.766 --> 01:49:18.626
[SPEAKER_14]: Sitting on the toilet.

01:49:19.006 --> 01:49:20.567
[SPEAKER_14]: Sitting on the toilet.

01:49:20.627 --> 01:49:20.847
[SPEAKER_14]: Rah!

01:49:21.328 --> 01:49:31.203
[SPEAKER_11]: another universal movie property that's going to get the game treatment as well and that's so awesome Back to the Future is getting some episodic games as well

01:49:33.308 --> 01:49:34.408
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of awesome, too.

01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:36.389
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell, Telltale?

01:49:36.769 --> 01:49:38.009
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean that in a good way.

01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:40.810
[SPEAKER_14]: Where the hell did this come from?

01:49:42.190 --> 01:49:53.234
[SPEAKER_14]: All them nerds at Telltale, and I say that in the most loving, endearing way, all them nerds at Telltale must have been sitting in the boardroom one day going, all right, what fucking nerdy, awesome things should we bring back?

01:49:54.034 --> 01:49:55.674
[SPEAKER_14]: And somebody was like, back to the future.

01:49:55.734 --> 01:49:56.795
[SPEAKER_14]: And somebody else said, fuck yeah.

01:49:57.335 --> 01:49:57.835
[SPEAKER_14]: And there it was.

01:49:58.895 --> 01:49:59.935
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's Day of the Tentacle?

01:50:00.516 --> 01:50:01.716
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more Day of the Tentacle.

01:50:03.089 --> 01:50:06.731
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to the Future, wasn't that actually a point-and-click game back in the day?

01:50:06.831 --> 01:50:09.593
[SPEAKER_14]: I seem to recall there was a LucasArts Back to the Future game.

01:50:09.813 --> 01:50:10.694
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

01:50:10.734 --> 01:50:12.575
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it have been LucasArts?

01:50:13.335 --> 01:50:18.098
[SPEAKER_11]: No, there was some side-scrolling games on the NES that really sucked.

01:50:18.659 --> 01:50:20.240
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, the first one was alright.

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.461
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one, Back to the Future 2 and 3, was terrible.

01:50:25.495 --> 01:50:27.776
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Jurassic Park also had video games.

01:50:27.916 --> 01:50:29.097
[SPEAKER_14]: Jurassic Park games were awesome.

01:50:29.117 --> 01:50:30.137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they were really fun.

01:50:30.217 --> 01:50:32.918
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought the Super Nintendo one was scary as fuck.

01:50:32.938 --> 01:50:38.121
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked playing the arcade one where you sit in because I've several times found that machine on accidental replay.

01:50:38.141 --> 01:50:39.301
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was fun.

01:50:39.361 --> 01:50:40.862
[SPEAKER_11]: All the Jurassic Park games are pretty awesome.

01:50:40.882 --> 01:50:42.043
[SPEAKER_11]: The arcade one was sweet.

01:50:42.103 --> 01:50:46.925
[SPEAKER_11]: The Super Nintendo one, which is kind of top-down, they went to almost a Wolfenstein mode.

01:50:47.325 --> 01:50:49.846
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the Genesis one where you play as a dinosaur.

01:50:49.866 --> 01:50:51.127
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was cool.

01:50:52.187 --> 01:51:19.695
[SPEAKER_14]: that was awesome I love the Super Nintendo one with that whole first person shooter thing and then like the dinosaurs would just jump out of nowhere like RARF although because the Super Nintendo's capability was so limited you had like this little tiny goggles thing on the screen to see it was it was kind of sad but it used surround sound it was one of the first games that had surround sound in it although I was too poor for that I thought it was awesome that it was surround sound on is it pro logic I guess because you know it only had stereo output

01:51:19.856 --> 01:51:21.790
[SPEAKER_14]: it was one of their old old old old ones

01:51:22.148 --> 01:51:35.393
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it was simulated cue sound or whatever, but it was an old version of... It must have been Prologic, because that's the only... But obviously, now it's coming from Telltale, it's probably going to be more of a point-and-click game, so it'll be nothing like any of those games.

01:51:35.413 --> 01:51:40.135
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I do believe it was Prologic, because I remember running it through our receiver.

01:51:42.816 --> 01:51:43.056
[SPEAKER_14]: Good time.

01:51:43.076 --> 01:51:46.017
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the Back to the Future game, there's going to be a lot of love for that.

01:51:46.037 --> 01:51:47.078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty excited about that.

01:51:47.118 --> 01:51:50.059
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me last night, and he was looking pretty giddy.

01:51:51.178 --> 01:51:56.184
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, you need to get Christopher Lloyd in and record a bunch of voice work because that guy is not getting any younger.

01:51:57.766 --> 01:51:58.207
[SPEAKER_11]: Good idea.

01:51:58.507 --> 01:52:00.710
[SPEAKER_11]: Same, you know, with Michael J. Fox, too.

01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:03.694
[SPEAKER_11]: Get him in there in the studio because he is not getting any younger.

01:52:04.707 --> 01:52:05.727
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some trivia for you.

01:52:07.128 --> 01:52:18.550
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, for a while, a Back to the Future pinball table, and if you look at it, Michael J. Fox's face is not on it because he would not lend his likeness to make the pinball table.

01:52:18.710 --> 01:52:19.050
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:21.071
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like what happened with Paul Abdul in that American Idol game.

01:52:21.111 --> 01:52:23.071
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know who was supposed to play him before?

01:52:23.151 --> 01:52:24.192
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't it Jason Bateman?

01:52:25.112 --> 01:52:28.213
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was Eric Roberts or something like that.

01:52:28.273 --> 01:52:28.513
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget.

01:52:29.173 --> 01:52:29.533
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget.

01:52:30.222 --> 01:52:32.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, Jason Bateman played the sequel, Teen Wolf.

01:52:33.045 --> 01:52:33.405
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

01:52:35.126 --> 01:52:35.527
[SPEAKER_11]: Teen Wolf 2.

01:52:36.347 --> 01:52:38.930
[SPEAKER_11]: And Teen Wolf the TV series coming to MTV.

01:52:40.451 --> 01:52:40.731
[SPEAKER_14]: Awful.

01:52:41.132 --> 01:52:46.837
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of awesome sounding games coming out soon, there is a Spongebob Squarepants MMO.

01:52:48.078 --> 01:52:49.119
[SPEAKER_14]: Shoot me in the head.

01:52:49.299 --> 01:52:50.360
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's awesome.

01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my reply to that.

01:52:55.089 --> 01:52:57.411
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you have against Spongebob Squarepants?

01:52:57.611 --> 01:52:58.011
[SPEAKER_14]: All of you.

01:52:58.092 --> 01:52:59.233
[SPEAKER_14]: What is your problem with Spongebob Squarepants?

01:52:59.253 --> 01:52:59.593
[SPEAKER_14]: It's dumb.

01:52:59.693 --> 01:53:01.574
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested in mental retardation.

01:53:02.555 --> 01:53:03.436
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a problem with it.

01:53:03.456 --> 01:53:04.197
[SPEAKER_14]: The show's okay.

01:53:04.637 --> 01:53:05.478
[SPEAKER_11]: It just grows on you.

01:53:05.598 --> 01:53:12.704
[SPEAKER_14]: When I flew to New York once, I watched Spongebob Squarepants the entire way, and it went a little something like this.

01:53:16.407 --> 01:53:18.128
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye, aye, Captain!

01:53:18.228 --> 01:53:19.449
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't hear you!

01:53:19.469 --> 01:53:19.910
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye, aye!

01:53:34.446 --> 01:53:41.069
[SPEAKER_04]: Spongebob Squarepants belongs to that whole time frame of Nickelodeon kid shows that were actually awful.

01:53:42.469 --> 01:53:43.070
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut your mouth.

01:53:44.190 --> 01:53:47.251
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be coming out in 2011, but here's the thing.

01:53:47.291 --> 01:53:51.393
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming out for China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and India.

01:53:52.426 --> 01:53:57.467
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us since y'all are hatin' on Spongebob?

01:54:15.734 --> 01:54:18.014
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something cool, actually cool, kind of.

01:54:19.655 --> 01:54:28.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 4 might be having... Well, actually, there might be a motion-sensing Street Fighter game in the works.

01:54:29.037 --> 01:54:43.240
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually Yoshinori Ono, who's the producer of Street Fighter 4, was saying that it could actually happen, that he was interested in motion-sensing ever since the Wii was launched, but he didn't think that Street Fighter...

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:44.640
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:55:06.087 --> 01:55:11.673
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, I don't know, I'm worried it's going to be in that same bin as like, what was it, Virtual Street Fighter?

01:55:11.713 --> 01:55:12.594
[SPEAKER_14]: What was it, Street Fighter EX?

01:55:12.694 --> 01:55:13.495
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that what it was called?

01:55:13.775 --> 01:55:14.496
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Street Fighter EX.

01:55:14.516 --> 01:55:15.998
[SPEAKER_14]: That really terrible Street Fighter game.

01:55:16.038 --> 01:55:17.399
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really bad, you guys.

01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:18.380
[SPEAKER_14]: Really bad.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.322
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually liked EX too.

01:55:20.783 --> 01:55:21.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

01:55:21.604 --> 01:55:24.587
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I actually, I managed to get it to run on a 486.

01:55:24.667 --> 01:55:24.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

01:55:24.847 --> 01:55:27.851
[SPEAKER_02]: The first EX, sorry.

01:55:28.942 --> 01:55:29.682
[SPEAKER_11]: That's old school.

01:55:29.902 --> 01:55:30.942
[SPEAKER_11]: We have breaking news, Rob.

01:55:31.803 --> 01:55:32.303
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we really?

01:55:32.423 --> 01:55:32.583
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:55:32.883 --> 01:55:34.463
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep closing the theme song, though.

01:55:34.483 --> 01:55:35.003
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not ready.

01:55:35.123 --> 01:55:37.364
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to warn me when you're going to have breaking news.

01:55:37.384 --> 01:55:38.404
[SPEAKER_11]: I just did.

01:55:39.584 --> 01:55:40.544
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave you warnings.

01:55:41.565 --> 01:55:42.185
[SPEAKER_11]: A few seconds.

01:55:43.505 --> 01:55:43.825
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:55:43.845 --> 01:55:44.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hold on.

01:55:44.325 --> 01:55:47.066
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to wake up the orchestra and get them to warm up.

01:55:47.126 --> 01:55:47.406
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

01:55:47.426 --> 01:55:48.266
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go, guys.

01:55:48.346 --> 01:55:49.126
[SPEAKER_14]: Breaking news.

01:55:49.406 --> 01:55:50.126
Breaking news.

01:55:59.332 --> 01:56:05.798
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming from a credible source, according to IGN, Retro Studios is creating a Donkey Kong title.

01:56:05.838 --> 01:56:10.622
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, the folks behind Metroid Prime are making a Donkey Kong game.

01:56:11.423 --> 01:56:12.324
[SPEAKER_11]: That's gonna be weird.

01:56:12.944 --> 01:56:13.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

01:56:13.565 --> 01:56:15.046
[SPEAKER_04]: First person Donkey Kong.

01:56:15.807 --> 01:56:18.269
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that could be interesting.

01:56:18.289 --> 01:56:19.951
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how I feel about that.

01:56:19.971 --> 01:56:21.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have to play it with the bongo drums?

01:56:22.313 --> 01:56:23.374
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no bongo drums.

01:56:23.734 --> 01:56:24.615
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Donkey Konga?

01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.991
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:56:49.853 --> 01:56:53.619
[SPEAKER_11]: People start acting goofy when they're wearing space ponchos.

01:56:53.739 --> 01:56:54.821
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is crazy.

01:56:55.562 --> 01:56:57.546
[SPEAKER_11]: I just heard that.

01:56:57.566 --> 01:56:59.649
[SPEAKER_11]: You should see the Donkey Kong game we're making.

01:56:59.669 --> 01:57:00.370
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

01:57:00.791 --> 01:57:02.534
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick an executive, take him out for drinks.

01:57:03.135 --> 01:57:03.796
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

01:57:05.495 --> 01:57:05.835
[SPEAKER_14]: XBOX Live

01:57:25.157 --> 01:57:29.899
[SPEAKER_11]: Arcade as digital downloads in celebration of the 11th anniversary of the Dreamcast.

01:57:30.199 --> 01:57:31.859
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's convenient timing if you ask me.

01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:37.041
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently one of the first games coming out will be Sonic Adventure.

01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:41.403
[SPEAKER_11]: Also Crazy Taxi is confirmed to be coming as well.

01:57:42.923 --> 01:57:44.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic Adventure I know is definitely out.

01:57:44.584 --> 01:57:45.804
[SPEAKER_14]: Crazy Taxi!

01:57:45.824 --> 01:57:48.285
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Sonic Adventure already leaked out.

01:57:52.878 --> 01:57:54.279
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need Jet Set and we're good.

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.641
[SPEAKER_04]: And Phantasy Star Online, the first ones.

01:57:59.961 --> 01:58:00.802
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of cool.

01:58:01.402 --> 01:58:04.823
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be actually really cool if Phantasy Star Online kind of came back, but on Xbox.

01:58:05.904 --> 01:58:07.184
[SPEAKER_14]: There's still private servers, Rob.

01:58:07.204 --> 01:58:08.585
[SPEAKER_14]: There's Phantasy Star Universe, too.

01:58:08.925 --> 01:58:11.066
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't talk about that terrible game.

01:58:11.426 --> 01:58:12.626
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that bad.

01:58:12.726 --> 01:58:13.267
[SPEAKER_14]: It's awful.

01:58:15.325 --> 01:58:22.351
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, every week we encourage you guys to send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read a few of them here live on air.

01:58:22.451 --> 01:58:22.731
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

01:58:22.771 --> 01:58:24.292
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we can, and we love you.

01:58:27.695 --> 01:58:33.380
[SPEAKER_14]: Now usually DarkSakura dives in and reads the emails, but because she's under doctor's orders tonight, she's not going to read the emails.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:34.180
[SPEAKER_14]: I am!

01:58:36.662 --> 01:58:43.388
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, but DarkSakura can feel free to comment, but she won't be criticizing spelling and grammar, sadly, because she can't.

01:58:44.148 --> 01:58:49.511
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, and plus I don't have good spelling and grammar, so I wouldn't be able to criticize you anyway.

01:58:49.931 --> 01:58:50.892
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get to the first email.

01:58:50.952 --> 01:58:54.794
[SPEAKER_14]: First email from our good pal, friend, buddy, RubbaBubbaBubba.

01:58:55.414 --> 01:58:59.777
[SPEAKER_14]: RubbaBubba is emailing us because he wants to tell us about Season 2 of The Tester.

01:59:00.577 --> 01:59:03.379
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I realize a lot of people gave The Tester shit.

01:59:04.077 --> 01:59:05.859
[SPEAKER_14]: and somewhat rightfully so.

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:10.023
[SPEAKER_14]: But it wasn't as terrible as I think some people made it out to be.

01:59:10.063 --> 01:59:12.425
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of people who really criticized it didn't watch it.

01:59:12.526 --> 01:59:14.307
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't the worst reality show I've ever seen.

01:59:14.668 --> 01:59:18.011
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, didn't one of those chicks on The Real Housewives get a spinoff show?

01:59:19.352 --> 01:59:20.213
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a few of them.

01:59:20.233 --> 01:59:22.114
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're going to hate the tester when there's that?

01:59:22.234 --> 01:59:22.915
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just saying.

01:59:23.435 --> 01:59:28.739
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, he wanted to write us to say, there is a casting call about to begin for season two of The Tester.

01:59:28.759 --> 01:59:35.184
[SPEAKER_14]: The prize this year seems to be a one-year contract with Sony and a $10,000 cash prize.

01:59:36.525 --> 01:59:37.686
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Miklatov, I found you a new job.

01:59:39.117 --> 01:59:39.817
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, right.

01:59:40.138 --> 01:59:41.478
[SPEAKER_14]: You've always wanted to be on a reality show, right?

01:59:41.498 --> 01:59:42.338
[SPEAKER_14]: You could do this.

01:59:42.358 --> 01:59:43.259
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just Survivor.

01:59:43.579 --> 01:59:47.720
[SPEAKER_14]: www.thetester.com Well, this is kind of like Survivor, but not really.

01:59:47.881 --> 01:59:52.042
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I know what being a tester is like, and I would not do that again.

01:59:52.322 --> 01:59:53.123
[SPEAKER_04]: You just get the $10,000 prize and quit.

01:59:54.841 --> 01:59:55.941
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you're in a contract.

01:59:55.961 --> 01:59:56.942
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true, huh?

01:59:57.402 --> 01:59:59.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I could be really bad so they could break me of my contract.

02:00:00.442 --> 02:00:11.105
[SPEAKER_14]: He also links us to a demonstration of the casting call at playstation-staging.gotcast.com You want to read the rules and all that stuff and get a video ready.

02:00:11.245 --> 02:00:12.685
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe they're due any day now.

02:00:13.165 --> 02:00:19.807
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see someone from OLR or even All Games kind of get in on this so I have someone to root for but I won't hold my breath.

02:00:19.827 --> 02:00:21.407
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it might be fun though.

02:00:22.884 --> 02:00:24.445
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on, those of you that are on Fun Employment.

02:00:24.465 --> 02:00:26.046
[SPEAKER_14]: I could try, I guess, but I don't want to be a tester.

02:00:26.066 --> 02:00:26.647
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about it.

02:00:27.267 --> 02:00:27.987
[SPEAKER_14]: Reality show.

02:00:29.308 --> 02:00:35.472
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so much fun to play the same... I don't think Nelly would be supportive of you leaving her with the new baby for a few weeks to go film this tester show.

02:00:35.492 --> 02:00:36.133
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be dumb, yeah.

02:00:36.193 --> 02:00:41.396
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody seems to understand that you played, like, the same stage over and over again for eight hours a day for, like, a month.

02:00:41.937 --> 02:00:44.899
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to listen to the same song when you're doing steps for, like, a month.

02:00:44.919 --> 02:00:46.120
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a good song, it's okay.

02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:47.601
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like playing Earth Defense Force.

02:00:47.921 --> 02:00:49.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I still haven't played that.

02:00:49.922 --> 02:00:50.923
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm missing out.

02:00:51.505 --> 02:00:55.912
[SPEAKER_14]: Another email in our mailbag at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com from Shook.

02:00:56.513 --> 02:00:58.335
[SPEAKER_14]: And Shook writes us, Hi, OLR.

02:00:58.916 --> 02:01:05.887
[SPEAKER_14]: I would personally like to thank DarkSakura for encouraging me to go back and replay good old Metal Gear Solid for the billionth time.

02:01:07.936 --> 02:01:09.197
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's a listener sucking up.

02:01:10.937 --> 02:01:11.378
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

02:01:11.578 --> 02:01:12.518
[SPEAKER_14]: That's inappropriate.

02:01:12.818 --> 02:01:16.360
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, thanks to PS1 Classics.

02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:19.141
[SPEAKER_14]: I downloaded it and fell in love with it all over again.

02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:20.922
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I'm going to replay the others too.

02:01:21.022 --> 02:01:23.743
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the excellent Game of the Week bit from Shook.

02:01:24.243 --> 02:01:25.064
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job, DarkSakura.

02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.325
[SPEAKER_14]: A pat on the back and a cookie for DarkSakura.

02:01:27.965 --> 02:01:28.345
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

02:01:28.385 --> 02:01:32.647
[SPEAKER_14]: But it'll have to be like, I don't know, like a herb cookie or something because she's on the natural thing.

02:01:33.287 --> 02:01:34.188
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get raw cookies.

02:01:34.864 --> 02:01:35.224
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

02:01:35.344 --> 02:01:36.325
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get raw cookies.

02:01:37.325 --> 02:01:39.005
[SPEAKER_16]: And keep in mind, I'm 70% raw.

02:01:40.686 --> 02:01:42.066
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see.

02:01:42.166 --> 02:01:44.887
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, going to an email from Damani125.

02:01:44.927 --> 02:01:46.308
[SPEAKER_14]: This is our last email tonight, folks.

02:01:46.388 --> 02:01:48.188
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this is going to be a great one, Miklatov.

02:01:48.989 --> 02:01:52.030
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, OLR, I'm finally sending this email because I got a droid now.

02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:55.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, now I can listen to your live stream by means of a free app.

02:01:55.151 --> 02:01:55.431
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

02:01:56.010 --> 02:01:56.871
[SPEAKER_14]: Droid Diction Oblivion 5 Elder Scrolls 5

02:02:18.788 --> 02:02:20.569
[SPEAKER_14]: And why are you barfing over there, Miklatov?

02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:22.691
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this discussion.

02:02:23.091 --> 02:02:24.312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but we didn't have it on the air.

02:02:24.392 --> 02:02:25.933
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's have it real quick.

02:02:27.093 --> 02:02:35.478
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you play, and if they have it there, Elder Scrolls V, I said that I will throw up because I hate the Elder Scrolls games.

02:02:35.558 --> 02:02:35.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

02:02:35.979 --> 02:02:36.459
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great.

02:02:36.499 --> 02:02:36.739
[SPEAKER_04]: Great!

02:02:36.759 --> 02:02:37.319
[SPEAKER_04]: They're boring.

02:02:37.339 --> 02:02:39.560
[SPEAKER_14]: They're some of the best games to ever come out for the season.

02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:39.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:40.460
[SPEAKER_04]: You are an idiot.

02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:41.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even close.

02:02:41.481 --> 02:02:43.581
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather... Okay, this is what happened.

02:02:43.962 --> 02:02:47.063
[SPEAKER_04]: When Morrowind came out, everybody was like, oh, it's the best game ever.

02:02:47.083 --> 02:02:49.684
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, okay, it's got to be awesome.

02:02:49.824 --> 02:02:50.844
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody says so.

02:02:51.244 --> 02:02:53.085
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Blockbuster and I rented it.

02:02:53.585 --> 02:02:57.206
[SPEAKER_04]: I returned it, oh, like an hour later.

02:02:57.646 --> 02:02:59.347
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, you can just get another game.

02:02:59.947 --> 02:03:02.288
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got Unlimited Saga.

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:29.315
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I returned it like 20 minutes later and I just didn't care after that because both of those games were awful but my point is Elder Scrolls is so boring I guess it's because I don't like the fact that you have like the main story and you can do whatever you want that's cool but it feels a little bit too much like you can do whatever you want so who cares about the main story

02:03:29.835 --> 02:03:31.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't I just go kill this entire town?

02:03:31.837 --> 02:03:34.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'll go be a vampire or something like that.

02:03:36.101 --> 02:03:36.801
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like them.

02:03:38.303 --> 02:03:43.788
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to give Fallout a try though, but I don't want to ever play an Elder Scrolls game again.

02:03:44.381 --> 02:03:50.310
[SPEAKER_14]: So apparently this whole time, Bobby has been leading an effort to get Space Poncho to trend on Twitter.

02:03:50.791 --> 02:03:55.898
[SPEAKER_14]: And he actually got some of the former Gamerscore blog people to start using Space Poncho.

02:03:55.918 --> 02:03:59.083
[SPEAKER_14]: All these people are now using the term Space Poncho on Twitter.

02:03:59.103 --> 02:03:59.684
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

02:04:02.557 --> 02:04:03.718
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to go get one tomorrow.

02:04:04.298 --> 02:04:05.318
[SPEAKER_14]: I officially endorse this.

02:04:05.378 --> 02:04:10.441
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a Twitter, you need to make a post right now about Space Poncho with a little tweet thing.

02:04:10.621 --> 02:04:11.902
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, four new tweets just popped up.

02:04:11.942 --> 02:04:12.342
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that.

02:04:12.562 --> 02:04:18.285
[SPEAKER_11]: And now to make the full circle, we need a picture of President Cat wearing a Space Poncho.

02:04:20.206 --> 02:04:22.167
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, good question from Salacious Pop in chat.

02:04:22.367 --> 02:04:23.847
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you like other sandbox games?

02:04:23.987 --> 02:04:24.928
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me examples.

02:04:25.528 --> 02:04:27.189
[SPEAKER_14]: Grand Theft Auto 4, Red Dead Redemption.

02:04:27.549 --> 02:04:32.672
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but my dislike for Red Dead Redemption is because I don't really like the old west.

02:04:33.072 --> 02:04:36.013
[SPEAKER_04]: So the setting just wasn't... So you just don't like sandbox games.

02:04:36.474 --> 02:04:37.554
[SPEAKER_14]: You want your games to be linear.

02:04:37.974 --> 02:04:45.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which might be why I like Final Fantasy XIII so much because I go forward and I can just attack enemies and I don't have to do much else.

02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:47.299
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let me go back to Damani's email here.

02:04:47.839 --> 02:04:52.665
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I've never played Oblivion 4 until after I played Fallout 3, but I still am really far into the game.

02:04:52.905 --> 02:04:57.230
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering if they'll ever make a fifth Oblivion, because it seems like they're focusing more on Fallout games now.

02:04:57.750 --> 02:05:01.054
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I do like Fallout more than Oblivion, but it seems like... By the way, do you like Fallout?

02:05:01.610 --> 02:05:02.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it yet.

02:05:02.591 --> 02:05:05.933
[SPEAKER_04]: I avoided it because people compared it to Elder Scrolls games.

02:05:05.953 --> 02:05:07.074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically Elder Scrolls with guns.

02:05:07.395 --> 02:05:09.476
[SPEAKER_14]: Which might be better.

02:05:11.157 --> 02:05:12.979
[SPEAKER_14]: There's less people that really have wanted to do a fifth one.

02:05:13.259 --> 02:05:16.982
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seems like no one ever talks about Oblivion so Bethesda doesn't see it selling that good.

02:05:17.382 --> 02:05:19.204
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I think you might be wrong, buddy.

02:05:19.384 --> 02:05:21.265
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it did sell very well.

02:05:21.285 --> 02:05:25.569
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think those games take years and years to develop.

02:05:25.929 --> 02:05:28.131
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a rumor about an MMO based on Oblivion.

02:05:28.151 --> 02:05:29.452
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that came out in court documents.

02:05:30.132 --> 02:05:34.977
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that's why I think it's not happening for a while, and I was just wondering how much you wanted the fifth one.

02:05:35.157 --> 02:05:35.958
[SPEAKER_14]: I want it very badly.

02:05:36.418 --> 02:05:37.099
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and one last thing.

02:05:37.139 --> 02:05:43.765
[SPEAKER_14]: I signed up for the Oil Army in the big battle at all games, and I think we need a battle cry, a battle hymn or song, and a slogan.

02:05:44.105 --> 02:05:46.688
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, a slogan would be like, Fight for Farity Justice.

02:05:47.148 --> 02:06:15.935
[SPEAKER_14]: a battle cry could be like for the ferret those are just examples I'm not sure what to do for the song well time for me to be hitting the old dusty trail I hope we get more people for the battle I'll be serving a tour of duty for OLR and Battlefield Bad Company 2 thank god I'm glad somebody's representing us in that because I don't own that game thank god hats off to you and I hope more people sign up for the Battlefield Bad Company 2 thing on the 26th I don't know do we have a battle cry that we could have we need to think about that chatters I put that to you too what should the battle cry be for the OLR army in the big battle

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:37.764
[SPEAKER_14]: and please remember guys for the horde please remember guys remember the number one rule of the oil army when you do participate in this event don't be a dick we like all these guys that are participating in it so don't be a dick it's just a fun thing it's a fun stupid it's like the olympics it promotes peace and harmony and a little bit of spirited competition that's what it's all about it's the olympics of video games

02:06:38.824 --> 02:06:40.064
[SPEAKER_14]: But only all games is invited.

02:06:41.105 --> 02:06:41.385
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:06:43.045 --> 02:06:43.305
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

02:06:43.385 --> 02:06:47.307
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Reject False Icons is possibly a battle cry that's being suggested.

02:06:47.327 --> 02:06:47.787
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good one.

02:06:47.887 --> 02:06:49.207
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that from SJ100Matt.

02:06:50.488 --> 02:06:50.748
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:06:51.008 --> 02:06:51.788
[SPEAKER_14]: That was it for the mailbag.

02:06:51.828 --> 02:06:55.169
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you would like to contribute more in the future.

02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:57.130
[SPEAKER_14]: For now, we're going to get a little bit angsty.

02:06:57.250 --> 02:06:57.770
[SPEAKER_14]: Grr.

02:06:58.070 --> 02:06:58.270
[SPEAKER_14]: Arrgh.

02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.970
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.

02:07:15.051 --> 02:07:16.672
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, F you to not having a voice.

02:07:18.053 --> 02:07:18.374
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki!

02:07:20.075 --> 02:07:24.098
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, F you to people on eBay to demand more money after an auction closes.

02:07:24.258 --> 02:07:25.979
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not how eBay works, stupid.

02:07:27.420 --> 02:07:30.703
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the fact that I'm getting sick the day before E3.

02:07:32.504 --> 02:07:32.884
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn it.

02:07:33.845 --> 02:07:34.806
[SPEAKER_14]: Niklatov?

02:07:35.590 --> 02:08:01.538
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to Roseville Golf Land for their crappy taking care of their beautiful Technica machine and for their 16 year old employees that are gone well that was a lot of angst tonight I think you guys did a very good job with your angst tonight we are going to get back into some gaming news but for some reason I forgot to put on our little list of things we're going to do tonight the Twitter topics we don't want to ignore Twitter so here we go we're going to go to Twitter topics right now

02:08:07.034 --> 02:08:09.056
[SPEAKER_14]: Gears of War Art Director Makes an Unreal Movie Pitch

02:08:33.633 --> 02:08:35.374
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd heard about this just before tonight's show.

02:08:35.394 --> 02:08:38.236
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, the Mortal Kombat wasn't the only movie pitch to happen this week.

02:08:38.637 --> 02:08:52.406
[SPEAKER_14]: Jerry O'Flaherty, which is our director for the original Gears of War, he apparently has done a pitch for a film called Samurai, but I guess it's based off Unreal, and you can actually look at a little clip right here, which there's one on the internet.

02:08:53.887 --> 02:08:54.928
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's all artsy.

02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:58.791
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of got that comic book-y look like 300 had a little bit.

02:08:59.772 --> 02:09:00.272
[SPEAKER_14]: That could be cool.

02:09:01.553 --> 02:09:06.362
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know though, haven't movies based on video games really not done well?

02:09:06.382 --> 02:09:08.606
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Prince of Persia did not do as well as they thought, huh?

02:09:10.510 --> 02:09:11.111
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of sad.

02:09:12.575 --> 02:09:16.259
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami sent us a link here about Arcade Infinity closing down.

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:19.622
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not before I can go play Technica.

02:09:19.722 --> 02:09:21.284
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is everybody against me?

02:09:21.304 --> 02:09:23.666
[SPEAKER_14]: This apparently, well, I don't think it's happened yet.

02:09:24.407 --> 02:09:32.695
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is an extensive story that's coming from a website, Shoryuken.com, that I guess is talking about the possibility about Arcade Infinity closing down.

02:09:32.755 --> 02:09:33.936
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what's going on.

02:09:33.956 --> 02:09:35.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Just another week and then I don't care.

02:09:36.418 --> 02:09:41.124
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I'm heartless Japan still has a lot of games to develop

02:09:54.759 --> 02:09:58.461
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting, but it doesn't say anything about whether for sure this arcade is shutting down or not.

02:09:58.481 --> 02:10:00.723
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the part that's kind of like getting me here.

02:10:00.783 --> 02:10:03.624
[SPEAKER_14]: But I guess, I don't know, it kind of said here near the end.

02:10:03.664 --> 02:10:04.605
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't read this whole story.

02:10:04.665 --> 02:10:06.006
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a feature here.

02:10:06.426 --> 02:10:11.389
[SPEAKER_14]: But they do intend to keep the arcade open strictly for the same reason he goes to work, the people.

02:10:11.809 --> 02:10:13.550
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows most of the people out there are like a friend.

02:10:13.591 --> 02:10:16.412
[SPEAKER_14]: The arcade to me is a business, but the people out there are now my friends.

02:10:16.452 --> 02:10:17.913
[SPEAKER_14]: I get excited for the games that are played.

02:10:18.614 --> 02:10:20.755
[SPEAKER_14]: So he doesn't say it's closing yet.

02:10:21.135 --> 02:10:25.598
[SPEAKER_04]: That mentality closed all of the arcades back in Wichita.

02:10:26.258 --> 02:10:26.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

02:10:26.739 --> 02:10:27.499
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of sad.

02:10:27.839 --> 02:10:29.020
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they don't actually close.

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:29.620
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be sad.

02:10:31.301 --> 02:10:31.962
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

02:10:33.203 --> 02:10:34.303
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw sent us another link.

02:10:34.323 --> 02:10:35.784
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let him have two tweets tonight because I'm nice.

02:10:36.445 --> 02:10:40.567
[SPEAKER_14]: Capcom will add Playboy advertising in Dead Rising 2 apparently is one of the big things.

02:10:40.587 --> 02:10:45.630
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, there are magazines and actual magazine pictures on the wall and then actual magazines you can pick up that are Playboy.

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:48.993
[SPEAKER_14]: But this whole inserting

02:10:49.873 --> 02:10:53.699
[SPEAKER_14]: Product placement or what have you in video games is kind of starting to become more and more of a trend.

02:10:53.759 --> 02:10:56.743
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet another way to make money off of games besides the $10 thing.

02:10:56.843 --> 02:11:01.670
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw Alan Wake this morning had the sync for the cars.

02:11:02.892 --> 02:11:05.796
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what it's called beyond sync, but that was in there.

02:11:06.737 --> 02:11:11.819
[SPEAKER_14]: So now the Playboy Bunny will show it up in the game along with some sexy ladies on the cover of the magazines.

02:11:11.859 --> 02:11:12.199
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

02:11:12.239 --> 02:11:12.959
[SPEAKER_14]: She's not wearing a bra.

02:11:13.199 --> 02:11:13.980
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that, Miklatov?

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:15.080
[SPEAKER_14]: She has no bra on.

02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:16.020
[SPEAKER_04]: I have bad eyes.

02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:16.700
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell.

02:11:17.141 --> 02:11:17.841
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just letting you know.

02:11:17.861 --> 02:11:20.042
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to have saggy boobs when she's old.

02:11:22.622 --> 02:11:23.603
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she's not wearing a bra?

02:11:24.823 --> 02:11:26.644
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why women wear a bra.

02:11:27.244 --> 02:11:28.945
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we don't want to know her when she's old.

02:11:29.045 --> 02:11:30.005
[SPEAKER_11]: We just want to know her now.

02:11:32.208 --> 02:11:35.549
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Iannami wants to send us this too about a story about Death Smiles.

02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:37.950
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently it's getting a US localization.

02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:40.591
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be coming out later this June by Axis.

02:11:40.951 --> 02:11:42.432
[SPEAKER_14]: It was originally developed by Cave.

02:11:42.872 --> 02:11:46.733
[SPEAKER_14]: They did Don Donpachi, Espegluta, and all these fun games.

02:11:47.433 --> 02:11:49.074
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there's going to be a localization.

02:11:49.094 --> 02:11:49.954
[SPEAKER_14]: The game is in English.

02:11:50.034 --> 02:11:51.315
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray, Death Smiles.

02:11:51.415 --> 02:11:55.636
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out in a limited edition set with a faceplate and soundtrack.

02:11:57.702 --> 02:11:57.943
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

02:11:59.405 --> 02:11:59.705
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:11:59.946 --> 02:12:01.589
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

02:12:01.629 --> 02:12:04.614
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.

02:12:04.634 --> 02:12:08.760
[SPEAKER_14]: Show us your tweets a little bit like the ladies in the Playboy magazine like to do.

02:12:09.679 --> 02:12:11.721
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's get back into some news, Loki.

02:12:40.022 --> 02:12:43.503
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, before this lawsuit, I did not know there was an active.com.

02:12:43.583 --> 02:12:53.426
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll have to see what happens or what that's going to do with EA Sports Active 2, which will be out this fall.

02:12:56.347 --> 02:12:56.667
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

02:12:57.428 --> 02:12:58.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds stupid.

02:13:01.949 --> 02:13:02.629
[SPEAKER_14]: More lawsuits.

02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:03.410
[SPEAKER_14]: This is America.

02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:04.490
[SPEAKER_14]: God bless America.

02:13:04.821 --> 02:13:15.065
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft.com wants some money sorry I was a little bit of dead air there I was looking at Space Poncho tweets on Twitter because apparently somebody actually made a Twitter account called Space Poncho now how long did that take like five seconds

02:13:16.033 --> 02:13:18.215
[SPEAKER_14]: A++ to whatever All Games Listener did that.

02:13:18.255 --> 02:13:20.177
[SPEAKER_14]: If it wasn't All Games Listener, it might have been somebody, I don't know.

02:13:20.317 --> 02:13:22.218
[SPEAKER_14]: Some other people are having fun with that little title now, too.

02:13:22.879 --> 02:13:23.159
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:24.400
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:30.805
[SPEAKER_14]: This game, I saw this actually originally on an Oh No They Didn't post earlier this week, but it also hit Destructoid.

02:13:30.846 --> 02:13:35.690
[SPEAKER_14]: It's apparently a game called Hey Baby, and I'm not talking about the No Doubt song.

02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:39.213
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this is a game called Hey Baby where you play a woman

02:13:39.833 --> 02:13:43.077
[SPEAKER_14]: who gets aggressively catcalled by men.

02:13:43.538 --> 02:13:48.164
[SPEAKER_14]: They will say, hey baby, nice ass, or hey, I wanna fuck you, or whatever they're gonna say.

02:13:48.805 --> 02:13:54.192
[SPEAKER_14]: And in this game, you take your aggressions out on these men by killing them.

02:13:54.813 --> 02:13:56.495
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when you kill them, they turn into tombstones.

02:13:56.635 --> 02:13:57.476
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like fun.

02:13:58.277 --> 02:14:02.858
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, um, it looked pretty awful, I gotta say, actually, from the little trailer I saw.

02:14:03.278 --> 02:14:10.060
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the comment I posted on OhNoTheyDidn't when I saw the little graphics, I was like, I think Hexen in 1996 had better graphics than this game.

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:12.840
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually a little trailer here we can actually look at here.

02:14:12.860 --> 02:14:14.420
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a thing on Twitter here.

02:14:16.441 --> 02:14:17.901
[SPEAKER_14]: It's payback time, boys!

02:14:17.921 --> 02:14:18.581
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at the graphics.

02:14:20.722 --> 02:14:21.762
[SPEAKER_14]: The graphics are terrible.

02:14:23.762 --> 02:14:25.483
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna see if we can get some of the, uh...

02:14:33.748 --> 02:14:36.349
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those guys said, God bless you, and you're going to shoot him?

02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:37.950
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a nice thing to say.

02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:40.031
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you're only supposed to shoot the bad people.

02:14:40.051 --> 02:14:41.611
[SPEAKER_14]: Some women are dopes.

02:14:41.812 --> 02:14:42.832
[SPEAKER_14]: Not all, just some.

02:14:42.892 --> 02:14:45.493
[SPEAKER_14]: But somebody saying, God bless you, that's not hitting on you.

02:14:45.533 --> 02:14:48.314
[SPEAKER_14]: You're probably ugly if you think that's the case, okay?

02:14:53.416 --> 02:14:55.357
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you shoot them and they turn into one-two stones.

02:14:56.761 --> 02:15:25.420
[SPEAKER_14]: and the tombstones say such awesome things as I love you and you should leave your man and come with me and wow you're so beautiful this game looks stupid and yep she shot the guy and said god bless you here's a flamethrower instead don't play this game this looks stupid like I'm all for like woman power and stuff but play Metroid it sounded like it would be fun for just a little waste of time as a flash game but that looked really dumb

02:15:33.712 --> 02:15:34.273
[SPEAKER_14]: That's funny.

02:15:35.535 --> 02:15:36.336
[SPEAKER_14]: What, the game?

02:15:36.596 --> 02:15:36.897
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:15:36.917 --> 02:15:38.098
[SPEAKER_14]: It just looks terrible.

02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:39.941
[SPEAKER_14]: It is terrible.

02:15:39.981 --> 02:15:40.422
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I get it.

02:15:40.482 --> 02:15:42.264
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a nice concept for a game.

02:15:42.344 --> 02:15:45.389
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny, but it's just executed terribly.

02:15:47.078 --> 02:15:56.625
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to get into another part of the show here that, gosh, we have not done this in a very, very, very, very, very long time.

02:15:57.106 --> 02:15:58.427
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm excited tonight.

02:15:58.467 --> 02:16:02.890
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to bring back the Orange Lounge Radio match game.

02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:03.450
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's right.

02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:07.073
[SPEAKER_14]: Video game match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:16:17.365 --> 02:16:22.152
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, some breaking news, and I'm not going to play the theme, but apparently the space ponchos just lit up green.

02:16:24.194 --> 02:16:26.197
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are we not going to this tomorrow?

02:16:27.399 --> 02:16:28.000
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to work.

02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:28.440
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

02:16:29.021 --> 02:16:30.944
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you, they're going to do the year 2000 thing.

02:16:33.702 --> 02:16:34.023
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:16:35.364 --> 02:16:36.325
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, let's get into the match game.

02:16:36.345 --> 02:16:45.553

02:17:49.180 --> 02:17:53.023
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll give it about 30 more seconds for our chatters to get their space ponchos in.

02:17:54.305 --> 02:17:58.809
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me ask XLink real quick while he's on the line, what are you really excited about for E3 over this next week?

02:17:58.849 --> 02:17:59.990
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything you're really looking forward to?

02:18:00.825 --> 02:18:01.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Space ponchos.

02:18:04.126 --> 02:18:05.047
[SPEAKER_14]: They're demanding it.

02:18:05.087 --> 02:18:06.307
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to get them.

02:18:06.447 --> 02:18:07.508
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't go.

02:18:07.908 --> 02:18:09.429
[SPEAKER_04]: Cough a little more.

02:18:09.449 --> 02:18:10.249
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds sicker.

02:18:11.630 --> 02:18:11.970
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:18:12.710 --> 02:18:15.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I count these people that are saying ponchos in space?

02:18:15.231 --> 02:18:15.511
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:18:15.531 --> 02:18:15.811
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:18:16.171 --> 02:18:16.792
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll count them.

02:18:17.052 --> 02:18:21.073
[SPEAKER_14]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

02:18:21.994 --> 02:18:22.834
[SPEAKER_14]: Ten people want to play.

02:18:22.874 --> 02:18:24.195
[SPEAKER_14]: Pick a number between one and ten.

02:18:25.115 --> 02:18:25.455
[SPEAKER_14]: Who, me?

02:18:25.575 --> 02:18:26.376
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov, yes.

02:18:26.516 --> 02:18:31.338
[SPEAKER_14]: You can pick a number between 1 and 10, Miklatov, because you're our guest.

02:18:31.698 --> 02:18:31.338
4.

02:18:31.718 --> 02:18:33.799
[SPEAKER_14]: 1, 2, 3, 4.

02:18:32.118 --> 02:18:33.799
[SPEAKER_14]: Ziba is going to get to play tonight.

02:18:33.859 --> 02:18:36.900
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to Ziba and say congrats.

02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:39.641
[SPEAKER_14]: You are playing...

02:18:41.838 --> 02:18:43.479
[SPEAKER_14]: Stand by.

02:18:43.939 --> 02:18:48.282
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so whether you like it or not, we're playing against Ziba.

02:18:48.742 --> 02:18:50.864
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, any, oops, wrong music.

02:18:51.004 --> 02:18:52.365
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, match game theme, hello.

02:18:52.425 --> 02:18:53.966
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a little while since we've done match game here.

02:18:54.006 --> 02:18:55.767
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little bit rusty here at Orange Laundry Studios.

02:18:56.487 --> 02:19:00.850
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan, do you have any words of discouragement for Ziba tonight, your opponent?

02:19:01.731 --> 02:19:02.111
[SPEAKER_14]: I win.

02:19:04.192 --> 02:19:05.213
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see what happens.

02:19:05.233 --> 02:19:06.033
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't argue that.

02:19:06.193 --> 02:19:07.654
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let me explain.

02:19:08.035 --> 02:19:09.716
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me explain how the match game works.

02:19:10.899 --> 02:19:11.219
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

02:19:38.117 --> 02:19:38.657
[SPEAKER_14]: Just for tonight.

02:19:39.097 --> 02:19:40.819
[SPEAKER_14]: The one and only Techmaster Loki.

02:19:41.319 --> 02:19:41.699
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:44.641
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, the biggest celebrity of them all, me.

02:19:45.582 --> 02:19:45.982
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

02:19:46.623 --> 02:19:48.884
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one and only Miglatov.

02:19:49.024 --> 02:19:50.065
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what else to call him.

02:19:51.086 --> 02:19:53.627
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Max Technica not playing Miglatov.

02:19:53.647 --> 02:19:55.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Arcade Infinity is going to close.

02:19:55.429 --> 02:19:58.811
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the drive back up, Sunnyvale is going to burn down or something.

02:19:58.891 --> 02:20:00.272
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just can't win.

02:20:02.677 --> 02:20:03.438
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:20:21.314 --> 02:20:24.035
[SPEAKER_14]: So all our followers on Twitter will get to see whatever you want to plug.

02:20:24.496 --> 02:20:25.976
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and you can plug it here on the show as well.

02:20:26.016 --> 02:20:27.397
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a fabulous prize, is it not?

02:20:27.897 --> 02:20:29.218
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

02:20:29.758 --> 02:20:30.458
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one.

02:20:31.299 --> 02:20:31.999
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number one.

02:20:32.059 --> 02:20:32.439
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is.

02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:39.803
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight.

02:20:41.444 --> 02:20:43.805
[SPEAKER_14]: Leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.

02:20:45.151 --> 02:21:03.868
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing Let me read that one more time

02:21:05.037 --> 02:21:12.622
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.

02:21:13.082 --> 02:21:17.325
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing.

02:21:21.688 --> 02:21:21.948
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

02:21:23.089 --> 02:21:23.589
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan is in.

02:21:23.629 --> 02:21:24.570
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding for me, too.

02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:25.310
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:26.251
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki's in.

02:21:26.411 --> 02:21:26.731
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

02:21:27.411 --> 02:21:28.812
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura has given the thumbs up.

02:21:28.852 --> 02:21:30.113
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the equivalent of a ding.

02:21:30.133 --> 02:21:32.835
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just waiting on Ziba to send me a private message.

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:34.920
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:38.382
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as Ziba sends me a private message there in chat, we'll be good to go.

02:21:39.922 --> 02:21:44.164
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, of course, if any of our folks are struggling, they can always read chat here.

02:21:45.184 --> 02:21:47.605
[SPEAKER_14]: Need and... Okay, there we go.

02:21:47.625 --> 02:21:48.485
[SPEAKER_14]: We got an answer from Ziba.

02:21:48.826 --> 02:21:49.146
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:21:49.746 --> 02:21:50.126
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

02:21:50.206 --> 02:21:51.186
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number one tonight.

02:21:51.487 --> 02:21:56.949
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.

02:21:57.389 --> 02:22:01.610
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing.

02:22:02.071 --> 02:22:03.091
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, what is your answer?

02:22:03.726 --> 02:22:26.387
[SPEAKER_14]: Space ponchos Space ponchos they will be showing What a surprise that that answer came up Alright, Ziba says They don't want people finding out about all the Games they will be showing What a serious answer Which means she's not gonna win It's like the poor person on the show That gets booed No, don't boo, it's a good answer If it was a real game show

02:22:27.489 --> 02:22:27.769
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:28.350
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know.

02:22:28.971 --> 02:22:29.571
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know.

02:22:29.992 --> 02:22:31.534
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe DarkSakura's like, I'm sick.

02:22:31.614 --> 02:22:33.556
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to write funny answers tonight.

02:22:33.876 --> 02:22:39.302
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the... Watermelon smashing.

02:22:39.563 --> 02:22:41.685
[SPEAKER_14]: Watermelon smashing they'll be showing.

02:22:41.745 --> 02:22:44.268
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, that is not a match with Space Poncho.

02:22:45.228 --> 02:22:51.190
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, they don't want people to find out about all the... Survey says space ponchos.

02:22:51.210 --> 02:22:52.650
[SPEAKER_14]: Space ponchos!

02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:54.330
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

02:22:54.430 --> 02:22:56.131
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan gets a match.

02:22:56.231 --> 02:22:58.091
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, Ryan.

02:22:58.111 --> 02:23:00.872
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one, Ziba, none.

02:23:00.932 --> 02:23:01.612
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay, Ziba.

02:23:01.632 --> 02:23:02.773
[SPEAKER_14]: There's four questions tonight.

02:23:02.813 --> 02:23:04.153
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a chance.

02:23:04.193 --> 02:23:05.413
[SPEAKER_14]: Ziba just sent me a cry.

02:23:05.573 --> 02:23:06.754
[SPEAKER_14]: Emote icon, don't cry.

02:23:06.814 --> 02:23:07.574
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a good answer.

02:23:08.868 --> 02:23:09.568
[SPEAKER_14]: Good thing there's no money

02:23:26.019 --> 02:23:26.640
[SPEAKER_14]: Half point.

02:23:27.481 --> 02:23:29.283
[SPEAKER_15]: I give a half point too.

02:23:29.343 --> 02:23:30.724
[SPEAKER_15]: Half point?

02:23:30.905 --> 02:23:34.068
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually think ports are games, so I say games.

02:23:34.148 --> 02:23:35.189
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I'm outvoted.

02:23:35.209 --> 02:23:37.051
[SPEAKER_14]: A half point for Ziba on that one.

02:23:37.211 --> 02:23:38.553
[SPEAKER_14]: And judges' rules are final.

02:23:39.274 --> 02:23:40.715
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't real TV.

02:23:41.095 --> 02:23:41.336
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:23:43.739 --> 02:23:44.699
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my answer.

02:23:44.739 --> 02:23:51.765
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the Bukkake-covered space ponchos they will be showing.

02:23:52.345 --> 02:23:53.066
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there you go.

02:23:53.106 --> 02:23:53.886
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the surprise.

02:23:53.927 --> 02:23:55.948
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why they have to wear the splash zone there.

02:23:56.789 --> 02:23:58.350
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a match with space ponchos, though?

02:23:58.770 --> 02:24:01.232
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't say Bukkake-covered, and I think that part is important.

02:24:01.733 --> 02:24:04.475
[SPEAKER_14]: Could be a half point because the other half is Bukkake.

[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:24:05.495 --> 02:24:06.036

[SPEAKER_14]: I could with her voice.

02:26:35.806 --> 02:26:36.947

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

02:26:55.902 --> 02:26:59.125
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna have space punchalities in the game.

02:27:01.027 --> 02:27:01.888
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be crazy.

02:27:02.288 --> 02:27:04.049
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Ponchalities.

02:27:04.210 --> 02:27:06.131

[SPEAKER_14]: Stryker in the movie.

02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:18.281
[SPEAKER_14]: Why Stryker?

02:27:18.301 --> 02:27:19.501
[SPEAKER_14]: Because everybody hates him.

02:27:21.519 --> 02:27:23.760
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, where the hell did the dinosaur answer come from?

02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:27.161
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you thinking about Mortal Kombat 2 where you could do the animalities?

02:27:40.848 --> 02:27:43.910
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking Jurassic Park and Mortal Kombat.

02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:44.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

02:27:44.451 --> 02:27:46.833
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to have something worth fighting.

02:27:47.073 --> 02:27:47.593
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

02:27:48.154 --> 02:27:48.534

[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan is leading with one and a half points to Ziba's half point, but it's still anybody's game.

02:28:00.049 --> 02:28:01.629
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's still anybody's game.

02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:03.490

[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

02:29:34.859 --> 02:29:35.220

[SPEAKER_14]: Ziba says, we forgot to add bouncing balls into the game.

02:29:43.927 --> 02:29:45.569
[SPEAKER_14]: Were there bouncing balls in Portal?

02:29:45.749 --> 02:29:45.829

02:34:58.463 --> 02:34:59.364
[SPEAKER_14]: You got a half point.

02:34:59.885 --> 02:35:02.127
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan, X-Link, you got two and a half points.

02:35:02.347 --> 02:35:03.228
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link is our winner.

02:35:03.348 --> 02:35:04.429
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

02:35:04.449 --> 02:35:05.130
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, good job.

02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:06.251
[SPEAKER_14]: A round of applause.

02:35:06.291 --> 02:35:07.572
[SPEAKER_14]: A good effort for Ziba.

02:35:07.692 --> 02:35:08.813
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

02:35:08.893 --> 02:35:09.414
[SPEAKER_14]: But she lost.

02:35:09.454 --> 02:35:10.015
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Ziba.

02:35:10.315 --> 02:35:10.815
[SPEAKER_14]: But good effort.

02:35:11.336 --> 02:35:11.596
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:35:11.656 --> 02:35:12.557
[SPEAKER_14]: At least you got a half point.

02:35:12.617 --> 02:35:14.099
[SPEAKER_14]: Most times these are complete shutouts.

02:35:14.599 --> 02:35:15.260
[SPEAKER_14]: So good job.

02:35:16.457 --> 02:35:24.226
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, as the winner, you get to plug anything you want here on the show tonight and we will even post it to Twitter, so send it to me as a private message.

02:35:24.546 --> 02:35:26.208
[SPEAKER_14]: What would you like to plug on tonight's program?

02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know.

02:35:30.233 --> 02:35:34.018
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know about this ahead of time, so I really don't have anything to plug.

02:35:34.534 --> 02:35:35.395
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there you have it.

02:35:35.435 --> 02:35:36.296
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job, X-Lane.

02:35:36.356 --> 02:35:39.338
[SPEAKER_14]: He's plugging apathy.

02:35:41.981 --> 02:35:42.661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually funny.

02:35:42.681 --> 02:35:47.766
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just looking at Threadless and there's a shirt on there that apathy, our country's leading cause of whatever.

02:35:48.206 --> 02:35:52.050
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you plug Orange Lingerie, or plug Space Ponchos.

02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.931
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you do that?

02:35:52.951 --> 02:35:53.191
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

02:35:54.372 --> 02:35:55.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Ponchos.

02:35:55.072 --> 02:35:55.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

02:35:57.426 --> 02:35:57.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Night.

02:35:58.046 --> 02:35:58.286
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:35:58.706 --> 02:36:01.047
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to X-Link, our winner tonight.

02:36:01.707 --> 02:36:02.788
[SPEAKER_14]: Our completely apathetic.

02:36:02.828 --> 02:36:04.568
[SPEAKER_14]: I did mention the prize up front, right?

02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:07.289
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had like 30 minutes to think about that while that game went on way too long.

02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:08.090
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:36:09.170 --> 02:36:10.971
[SPEAKER_14]: How many listeners did we lose during the match game tonight?

02:36:10.991 --> 02:36:11.811
[SPEAKER_14]: Just out of curiosity.

02:36:11.871 --> 02:36:12.591
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, we gained some.

02:36:12.711 --> 02:36:12.971
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

02:36:13.912 --> 02:36:15.832
[SPEAKER_14]: We might have to do the match game every week.

02:36:17.493 --> 02:36:17.753
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:36:17.893 --> 02:36:20.414
[SPEAKER_04]: They just wanted to hear Space Poncho said over and over again.

02:36:20.434 --> 02:36:21.154
[SPEAKER_14]: They did.

02:36:21.174 --> 02:36:24.815
[SPEAKER_14]: The people that download the podcast tomorrow, it's not going to be funny anymore after tonight.

02:36:25.515 --> 02:36:26.876
[SPEAKER_14]: But now we're going to milk it up for all it's worth.

02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.550
[SPEAKER_14]: PowerGig

02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:59.663
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game, you know, which before the whole Rock Band 3 announcement of what exactly they're going to have there.

02:37:00.023 --> 02:37:03.705
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounded pretty cool and unique, but it will also be out this fall.

02:37:04.125 --> 02:37:11.429
[SPEAKER_11]: Their guitar, of course, is actually going to be an electric guitar, a real electric guitar that also will have fret buttons on it as well.

02:37:11.909 --> 02:37:19.573
[SPEAKER_11]: The real difference between that and, say, the Rock Band guitar is that you can plug this directly into an amp and actually play an electric guitar.

02:37:19.833 --> 02:37:21.696
[SPEAKER_11]: Dave Matthews Band, Kid Rock, Eric Clapton

02:37:36.229 --> 02:37:36.669
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

02:37:55.843 --> 02:38:03.289
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironically though, while their guitar may be really cool, they release pics and information about their drum set, which looks like shit.

02:38:03.989 --> 02:38:09.954
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason why it's pretty crappy is because you actually don't hit the drums.

02:38:10.254 --> 02:38:11.955
[SPEAKER_11]: You hit above the drums.

02:38:12.756 --> 02:38:14.417
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like playing air drums, I guess.

02:38:15.718 --> 02:38:18.020
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is kind of strange.

02:38:21.490 --> 02:38:24.452
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just excited we're actually going to get to see this game at E3 this year.

02:38:24.853 --> 02:38:27.054
[SPEAKER_14]: Because when they went to PAX, they didn't show anything.

02:38:28.816 --> 02:38:30.597
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I wish we'd see Scratch there too.

02:38:30.918 --> 02:38:32.179
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be kind of cool.

02:38:32.679 --> 02:38:35.581
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have it for the iPad or iPhone or whatever they were saying.

02:38:36.502 --> 02:38:40.766
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather see the PC version because that's one that's actually going to be kind of similar to the console release.

02:38:40.866 --> 02:38:41.066
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:53.145
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR It's not open yet, guys.

02:38:54.486 --> 02:38:56.247
[SPEAKER_14]: I like how the calls start coming in instantly.

02:38:56.287 --> 02:38:58.288
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I'm just looking at all the Space Poncho tweets.

02:38:58.308 --> 02:38:59.008
[SPEAKER_14]: It's doing pretty good.

02:39:00.169 --> 02:39:00.869
[SPEAKER_14]: It's doing pretty good.

02:39:01.329 --> 02:39:03.190
[SPEAKER_14]: It's catching on a little more than President Cat, I think.

02:39:03.631 --> 02:39:07.413
[SPEAKER_14]: It might actually... If the World Cup wasn't happening right now, it might trend.

02:39:07.473 --> 02:39:07.893
[SPEAKER_14]: We would see.

02:39:09.686 --> 02:39:10.287
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

02:39:10.367 --> 02:39:17.352
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on to one more story, guys, about a new game from the guy who was wearing a space poncho earlier, Itagaki.

02:39:17.733 --> 02:39:18.353
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

02:39:18.573 --> 02:39:19.174
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

02:39:19.654 --> 02:39:21.035
[SPEAKER_14]: Tomonobu Itagaki.

02:39:21.095 --> 02:39:28.961
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the guy who did Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden, and he's kind of known for, well, tit engines, basically.

02:39:29.042 --> 02:39:30.703
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if you play Dead or Alive.

02:39:30.743 --> 02:39:31.684
[SPEAKER_14]: Tit and blood engines.

02:39:31.724 --> 02:39:32.124
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

02:39:32.164 --> 02:39:32.604
[SPEAKER_14]: Good times.

02:39:32.985 --> 02:39:35.567
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he left Temco, and now he's at THQ.

02:39:36.407 --> 02:39:38.508
[SPEAKER_14]: And they debuted the game that he is working on.

02:39:38.568 --> 02:39:40.169
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Devil's Third.

02:39:40.649 --> 02:39:42.771
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from his new studio, Valhalla Games.

02:39:42.931 --> 02:39:46.172
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's violence, violence, violence, and gore.

02:39:46.573 --> 02:39:50.515
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's going to be on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

02:39:50.995 --> 02:39:53.876
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is a little trailer that's kind of surfing around the internet right now.

02:39:53.956 --> 02:39:58.679
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to take a look here at the trailer here for Devil's Third.

02:39:58.719 --> 02:40:00.500
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to see all the blood and violence in this game.

02:40:07.731 --> 02:40:11.253
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow, that shotgun made all the limbs explode.

02:40:11.273 --> 02:40:12.554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there were chunks coming off.

02:40:12.614 --> 02:40:14.075
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of gross, but funny.

02:40:15.816 --> 02:40:17.197
[SPEAKER_14]: See, this is cartoony.

02:40:18.097 --> 02:40:19.178
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that, the machine gun.

02:40:19.198 --> 02:40:20.439
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like I was flying up the building.

02:40:23.681 --> 02:40:25.201
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like a bad game.

02:40:25.261 --> 02:40:26.362
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised.

02:40:26.382 --> 02:40:26.902
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

02:40:28.964 --> 02:40:30.685
[SPEAKER_14]: See, there's a girl in this.

02:40:30.765 --> 02:40:32.646
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what the Hey Baby game should have been.

02:40:33.927 --> 02:40:34.387
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

02:40:35.973 --> 02:40:38.655
[SPEAKER_04]: The music kind of makes it more fun to watch, too.

02:40:38.715 --> 02:40:39.856
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, cars exploding.

02:40:39.956 --> 02:40:41.857
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you could do some great YouTubes to this, I bet.

02:40:43.018 --> 02:40:43.699
[SPEAKER_14]: Devil's Third.

02:40:43.839 --> 02:40:44.439
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like fun.

02:40:44.819 --> 02:40:45.620
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet we'll get to play it.

02:40:45.780 --> 02:40:46.100
Yay!

02:40:47.061 --> 02:40:48.422
[SPEAKER_04]: And then decide it's not fun.

02:40:49.623 --> 02:40:50.203
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

02:40:50.904 --> 02:40:56.228
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that's going to do it for our regular stories tonight, but we might have some last-minute stories.

02:40:56.788 --> 02:40:57.348
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:40:57.448 --> 02:41:03.593
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if any last-minute stories are on deck, and then we'll get to the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:03.953 --> 02:41:05.014
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you have some quick stories here?

02:41:05.932 --> 02:41:07.233
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, nothing pulled up, unfortunately.

02:41:07.393 --> 02:41:09.495
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, luckily for you, we have a call coming in.

02:41:09.515 --> 02:41:10.456
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:41:10.476 --> 02:41:10.816
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

02:41:12.517 --> 02:41:13.558
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.

02:41:13.818 --> 02:41:14.779
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Ray Ayanami.

02:41:14.799 --> 02:41:15.579
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind tonight?

02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:22.284
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, about the Desmos thing I posted earlier, I'm pretty sure I already posted something like that months ago.

02:41:22.404 --> 02:41:25.867
[SPEAKER_09]: The point I wanted to make was the dialogue that they localized.

02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:27.441
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the screenshots?

02:41:27.661 --> 02:41:29.883
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you noticed, did you see how all the dialogue was localized?

02:41:29.923 --> 02:41:30.083
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

02:41:48.689 --> 02:41:55.091
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, apparently someone posted this on Shmobs4, and people pretty much exploded over it just because of how badly it was done.

02:41:55.111 --> 02:42:01.753
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it kind of reminds me of how someone would go about dubbing a 4Kids anime.

02:42:04.674 --> 02:42:05.674
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to get this game, though?

02:42:05.694 --> 02:42:07.335
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to get the Death Smiles game when it comes out?

02:42:07.675 --> 02:42:09.275
[SPEAKER_09]: I've already pre-ordered it.

02:42:09.455 --> 02:42:14.697
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the shitty dialogue doesn't stop the game from being any less playable.

02:42:15.518 --> 02:42:45.099
[SPEAKER_09]: but it just worries but I have a slight feeling that some people might remember the game for the dialogue and not for the gameplay but then again it's a shmup and no one really plays the game for a shmup for the dialogue so I guess I'm not all that worried you play for the bullets everywhere let me ask you another question Ray and I'm going to ask this of all the callers tonight so if you're going to call into the show be prepared what are you most looking forward to about E3 next week besides Space Pontius I don't really know I don't really follow all the like

02:42:45.973 --> 02:42:47.494
[SPEAKER_09]: Big name stuff.

02:42:48.415 --> 02:42:49.555
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more of an E3 gamer.

02:42:51.437 --> 02:42:52.337
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, fair enough.

02:42:53.018 --> 02:42:54.659
[SPEAKER_14]: E3, I guess, isn't a big deal for everybody.

02:42:55.379 --> 02:42:55.839
[SPEAKER_14]: That's alright.

02:42:56.200 --> 02:42:57.841
[SPEAKER_14]: Every gamer gets a voice, even when you're wrong.

02:42:57.961 --> 02:42:58.381
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

02:42:58.801 --> 02:42:59.061
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:42:59.442 --> 02:43:02.484
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but do you have any last thoughts for our listeners?

02:43:03.504 --> 02:43:04.365
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

02:43:04.425 --> 02:43:07.907
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I got to play Escalude 2 this week.

02:43:08.247 --> 02:43:10.969
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'll talk about that on another call.

02:43:13.226 --> 02:43:13.486
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

02:43:13.586 --> 02:43:14.486
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what'd you think?

02:43:14.807 --> 02:43:16.287
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us a quick summary of what you thought.

02:43:17.147 --> 02:43:17.787
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fun.

02:43:17.807 --> 02:43:25.750
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like most bullet hell shooters, except being slowdown bullets and among other things.

02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:29.811
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you like it or pass?

02:43:30.251 --> 02:43:36.813
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fun, but I keep holding back from playing the game just because of how difficult it is to play for score.

02:43:37.933 --> 02:43:38.233
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:43:38.834 --> 02:43:41.757
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, keep playing and let us know what you think, all right?

02:43:42.297 --> 02:43:42.578
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:43:42.718 --> 02:43:42.938
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:43:43.078 --> 02:43:43.538
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

02:43:43.959 --> 02:43:44.299
[SPEAKER_14]: See you.

02:43:44.319 --> 02:43:44.459
[SPEAKER_14]: Later.

02:43:44.479 --> 02:43:44.800
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:48.123
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get some more calls here on the Skype line.

02:43:48.143 --> 02:43:48.883
[SPEAKER_14]: 877-GAME-OLR.

02:43:49.024 --> 02:43:51.286
[SPEAKER_14]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:51.346 --> 02:43:52.127
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get to another call.

02:43:52.507 --> 02:43:53.488
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:53.528 --> 02:43:53.908
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

02:43:57.472 --> 02:43:57.852
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

02:43:57.872 --> 02:43:58.533
[SPEAKER_14]: Hola.

02:43:58.573 --> 02:44:00.274
[SPEAKER_14]: Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:00.454 --> 02:44:00.815
[SPEAKER_14]: Quienes?

02:44:02.867 --> 02:44:04.809
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-oh, we have a bad call.

02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:09.194
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, call Echo 123 before you call Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:09.214 --> 02:44:11.777
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good way to test your connection to make sure it works.

02:44:12.939 --> 02:44:14.080
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:14.461
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

02:44:15.677 --> 02:44:16.578
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Scarzo.

02:44:16.598 --> 02:44:17.418
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, Rob?

02:44:17.498 --> 02:44:19.339
[SPEAKER_14]: What is up, Scarzo?

02:44:19.419 --> 02:44:20.440
[SPEAKER_14]: What is on your mind, buddy?

02:44:21.540 --> 02:44:24.702
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to tell Miklatov, you know, I jumped in my GMC DeLorean.

02:44:24.742 --> 02:44:26.323
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought I saw him on Friday night.

02:44:26.423 --> 02:44:29.164
[SPEAKER_12]: I totally forgot to post that on the chat line.

02:44:29.745 --> 02:44:35.788
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw somebody who was actually kind of bummed out about DJ Max Technica being down on Friday night.

02:44:35.808 --> 02:44:37.589
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys were there on Saturday, right?

02:44:37.689 --> 02:44:39.830
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just you, Miklatov.

02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:44.253
[SPEAKER_04]: I could imagine that a lot of people would be upset about that because it's supposed to be a really, really good game.

02:44:44.935 --> 02:44:50.396
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me tell you, Mikotov, straight up, dude, because Roosevelt Golf Land, Rob, go ahead and fill in your input.

02:44:51.077 --> 02:44:52.917
[SPEAKER_12]: Roosevelt Golf Land is crap, by the way.

02:44:53.357 --> 02:44:54.157
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the problem.

02:44:54.538 --> 02:44:56.418
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a problem with the hard drive.

02:44:56.918 --> 02:44:58.859
[SPEAKER_12]: This was when I started playing back in December.

02:44:59.459 --> 02:45:01.019
[SPEAKER_12]: They were getting a lot of blue screen of dev.

02:45:01.059 --> 02:45:02.079
[SPEAKER_12]: The game was lagging.

02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:03.040
[SPEAKER_12]: It was slowing down.

02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:03.860
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just horrible.

02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:07.561
[SPEAKER_12]: So the problem was they would just have to restart it, and I can just keep going.

02:45:08.342 --> 02:45:12.446
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't until like maybe a month ago where it just blue screened.

02:45:12.806 --> 02:45:17.191
[SPEAKER_12]: They would restart it because they know I'm the regular over there and I will always play during Arcade Mania.

02:45:17.672 --> 02:45:19.674
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like Friday, Saturday nights after I get off work.

02:45:20.435 --> 02:45:22.857
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem was it runs on Windows XP, by the way.

02:45:23.338 --> 02:45:25.901
[SPEAKER_12]: It starts up and it says that the program cannot start.

02:45:26.670 --> 02:45:28.491
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it about a thousand million times better.

02:45:45.259 --> 02:45:48.860
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to remember Miklatov is totally biased and partial towards Korean music.

02:45:48.880 --> 02:45:50.841
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very true.

02:45:50.941 --> 02:45:53.042
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you try to get it in DDR here in America?

02:45:53.102 --> 02:45:53.762
[SPEAKER_14]: Korean stuff?

02:45:53.802 --> 02:45:54.022
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

02:45:54.122 --> 02:45:54.362
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:45:54.882 --> 02:45:55.903
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you tried to do that.

02:45:55.963 --> 02:45:56.743
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that would be cool.

02:45:56.803 --> 02:45:57.423
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.

02:45:57.763 --> 02:45:58.324
[SPEAKER_14]: I might have.

02:45:58.384 --> 02:45:59.084
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember.

02:45:59.164 --> 02:46:01.465
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how much I'm allowed to talk about.

02:46:02.746 --> 02:46:06.729
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's assume, let's hypothesize you got to actually suggest songs for inclusion in the game.

02:46:07.189 --> 02:46:08.710
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't you have written down a bunch of Korean songs?

02:46:09.130 --> 02:46:13.834
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might have, but I was more always leaning towards 90s music.

02:46:14.114 --> 02:46:18.958
[SPEAKER_04]: Because who wouldn't want to do like, you know, Rhythm is a Dancer.

02:46:19.078 --> 02:46:20.879
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it all ended up in Hardest Party, and I was like...

02:46:20.919 --> 02:46:21.079
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Maxx

02:46:38.357 --> 02:46:42.301
[SPEAKER_04]: and I swear I played that for like eight hours straight because it was just that much fun.

02:46:42.341 --> 02:46:48.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've got mission mode, you've got, you know, really good songs and, you know, it's worth it.

02:46:49.027 --> 02:46:52.650
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really throw my support too much behind the American version.

02:46:53.051 --> 02:46:53.952
[SPEAKER_04]: It was decent.

02:46:54.672 --> 02:46:55.252
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Maxx Fever

02:47:21.199 --> 02:47:49.501
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not a terrible game it's just there were a lot of problems with it that they have not released an update to fix but you know you get some of the best songs from the first two games in it definitely if you can get it for like I don't know 10 or 15 bucks that's worth it I wouldn't pay more than more than 15 for it though okay and did you hear about the Technica 2 soundtrack being leaked because I can't find that yet and that's a tough one just the limited edition version

02:47:50.399 --> 02:47:58.723
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's on a Korean website because I'm friends with some of the Sunnyvale Golf Line players because that's where most of the top score, the elitist players are.

02:47:59.203 --> 02:48:04.005
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of them got their hands on it and they were telling me about it and I was just like, man, I gotta look for that.

02:48:04.325 --> 02:48:13.489
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought through a website the limited edition Technica soundtrack that came with the card and the keychain and the soundtrack.

02:48:14.689 --> 02:48:20.232
[SPEAKER_04]: and I actually have it with me too because it's a good card holder and I knew I'd get my hands on some of the Technica 1 cards.

02:48:21.233 --> 02:48:23.794
[SPEAKER_04]: The soundtrack is crap though.

02:48:23.954 --> 02:48:25.334
[SPEAKER_12]: I was hearing mixed reviews.

02:48:25.415 --> 02:48:26.215
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong.

02:48:26.295 --> 02:48:27.015
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the music.

02:48:27.095 --> 02:48:28.396
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something new for my ears.

02:48:28.876 --> 02:48:30.357
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong.

02:48:30.437 --> 02:48:31.157
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to give it a shot.

02:48:31.197 --> 02:48:32.418
[SPEAKER_04]: Technica has way better music.

02:48:32.458 --> 02:48:38.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Technica 1 and at least when Technica 2, if it's not already out for real, it will have most of that Technica 1 music on it.

02:48:39.681 --> 02:48:41.462
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

02:48:41.562 --> 02:48:44.563
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to jump in here because I do have to wrap up and get to other calls, but I like this caller.

02:48:44.603 --> 02:48:45.203
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got energy.

02:48:45.263 --> 02:48:45.723
[SPEAKER_14]: He's local.

02:48:45.763 --> 02:48:46.523
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows what he's talking about.

02:48:46.723 --> 02:48:49.844
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and I can talk about DJ Max, and that's something I can do for hours.

02:48:50.024 --> 02:48:51.885
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and so if I don't jump in here, that won't happen.

02:48:51.905 --> 02:48:54.186
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Rob, this is your boy, Jay Hugo, on Twitter, by the way.

02:48:54.206 --> 02:48:55.146
[SPEAKER_12]: Not trying to put a plug.

02:48:55.186 --> 02:48:55.846
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't follow me.

02:48:55.906 --> 02:48:56.466
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

02:48:56.526 --> 02:48:58.047
[SPEAKER_12]: This is your boy, Jay Hugo, okay?

02:48:58.167 --> 02:48:58.407
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:48:58.467 --> 02:49:02.428
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I appreciate it, and one of these days, if I actually go to Roseville Golf Land again, although you missed it.

02:49:02.468 --> 02:49:03.108
[SPEAKER_14]: I was there Saturday.

02:49:03.428 --> 02:49:04.048
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll meet up.

02:49:04.229 --> 02:49:05.509
[SPEAKER_14]: What was I going to say?

02:49:05.569 --> 02:49:07.049
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm asking all the callers this.

02:49:07.430 --> 02:49:08.830
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you looking forward to at E3 this year?

02:49:10.057 --> 02:49:13.981
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, you know, okay, like, I'm not a big, I don't play fighters, but I love watching it.

02:49:14.081 --> 02:49:15.443
[SPEAKER_12]: It feels like a competitive movie.

02:49:15.823 --> 02:49:17.865
[SPEAKER_12]: Marvel vs. Capcom, I got a bunch of friends.

02:49:18.346 --> 02:49:19.928
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks pretty cool, in my opinion.

02:49:20.188 --> 02:49:25.113
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I would go, if I could go to E3 with you, I'd be there for the bukkake, but you know, that's another radio show.

02:49:25.293 --> 02:49:25.774
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can't be

02:49:26.034 --> 02:49:27.735
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:49:28.815 --> 02:49:31.396
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you want that to be put in the podcast?

02:49:31.416 --> 02:49:32.636
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:49:32.676 --> 02:49:33.377
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

02:49:33.457 --> 02:49:34.117
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

02:49:34.297 --> 02:49:35.737
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can go bleep me out.

02:49:35.797 --> 02:49:36.478
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

02:49:36.498 --> 02:49:36.958
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, it's funny.

02:49:36.998 --> 02:49:37.258
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

02:49:37.598 --> 02:49:37.878
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:49:38.678 --> 02:49:39.138
[SPEAKER_12]: I like him.

02:49:39.179 --> 02:49:39.639
[SPEAKER_14]: He's funny.

02:49:39.679 --> 02:49:41.799
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to have to get him on the show at some point.

02:49:41.819 --> 02:49:42.079
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:45.201
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish he would be there and the Technica machine would be working.

02:49:45.221 --> 02:49:46.381
[SPEAKER_04]: We could always have a good time.

02:49:47.102 --> 02:49:50.688
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, one quick thing, Platinum Crew is great.

02:49:50.748 --> 02:49:54.836
[SPEAKER_12]: Technica 2, dual mixing, blah blah blah, the interface is a little weird.

02:49:55.076 --> 02:49:56.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love that interface for 2.

02:49:56.779 --> 02:49:57.560
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks so nice.

02:49:58.556 --> 02:49:58.756
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

02:49:58.836 --> 02:49:59.356
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful.

02:49:59.576 --> 02:50:03.538
[SPEAKER_12]: But not as hot as the classicalized singer, the female, when she had long hair, though.

02:50:03.578 --> 02:50:04.418
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I got to say.

02:50:04.738 --> 02:50:07.399
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming soon is going to be a new podcast, apparently.

02:50:07.739 --> 02:50:09.640
[SPEAKER_14]: Ironically, a music game podcast with these two.

02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:11.221
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just going to talk for hours about it.

02:50:11.421 --> 02:50:12.001
[SPEAKER_14]: I could do it.

02:50:12.401 --> 02:50:13.462
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

02:50:13.522 --> 02:50:14.582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you go.

02:50:14.682 --> 02:50:15.202
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you go.

02:50:15.262 --> 02:50:16.243
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you guys go.

02:50:16.483 --> 02:50:17.123
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good night.

02:50:17.143 --> 02:50:17.863
[SPEAKER_12]: First time calling.

02:50:17.903 --> 02:50:19.484
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for everything.

02:50:19.584 --> 02:50:21.845
[SPEAKER_12]: And, man, I've been missing out on the last eight years, but I'm here now.

02:50:22.185 --> 02:50:23.085
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's keep it going, guys.

02:50:23.205 --> 02:50:24.306
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad to have you, buddy.

02:50:24.486 --> 02:50:25.086
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a good one.

02:50:26.046 --> 02:50:26.586
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a good guy.

02:50:26.646 --> 02:50:28.907
[SPEAKER_14]: He always pimps our show on the Twitter and stuff.

02:50:28.927 --> 02:50:30.007
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't think I don't notice that stuff.

02:50:30.027 --> 02:50:30.907
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate that.

02:50:31.168 --> 02:50:32.428
[SPEAKER_14]: He's very enthusiastic about the show.

02:50:32.448 --> 02:50:33.628
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take another call from him.

02:50:33.648 --> 02:50:34.508
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate it.

02:50:34.628 --> 02:50:36.389
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we've got to get to more other calls.

02:50:36.949 --> 02:50:40.930
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, guys, I know you think I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's E3.

02:50:41.090 --> 02:50:44.391
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't control when there is breaking news.

02:50:45.131 --> 02:50:45.151
E3

02:50:52.967 --> 02:51:08.685
[SPEAKER_14]: Tom Brokaw here, Bukake, anyway, no, what I really wanted to point out was that it has been revealed that there is a Star Wars game, we mentioned this before, there is a Star Wars game for Kinect, and it has been announced it will feature controller-free lightsaber fighting.

02:51:10.088 --> 02:51:11.148
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, how does that work?

02:51:11.168 --> 02:51:11.468
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

02:51:11.849 --> 02:51:12.509
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's the thing.

02:51:12.589 --> 02:51:14.649
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to love Microsoft.

02:51:15.169 --> 02:51:16.090
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to love them.

02:51:16.130 --> 02:51:18.290
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you can hate them, but you've got to love them.

02:51:18.930 --> 02:51:23.711
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't even make it a secret that they just rip off other people's ideas and make it better.

02:51:24.012 --> 02:51:27.872
[SPEAKER_14]: What is everybody wanted on the Wii since the first day people put their hands on the controller?

02:51:28.433 --> 02:51:29.633
[SPEAKER_14]: Lightsaber battles.

02:51:29.673 --> 02:51:30.713
[SPEAKER_14]: But is it going to be better?

02:51:30.733 --> 02:51:32.173
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you won't have anything in your hands.

02:51:32.514 --> 02:51:33.614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the videos for...

02:51:34.634 --> 02:51:38.715
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just gonna find a random object, like, I don't know, like a pie roller.

02:51:38.755 --> 02:51:41.536
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to Kotaku right now, their top story there is showing the space ponchos, and they have video.

02:51:54.019 --> 02:51:54.419
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?

02:51:54.439 --> 02:51:55.100
[SPEAKER_11]: This is creepy.

02:51:55.120 --> 02:51:55.840
[SPEAKER_14]: They're plant people.

02:51:56.140 --> 02:51:56.500
[SPEAKER_14]: They're moving...

02:52:23.237 --> 02:52:25.259
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck does this have to do with video games?

02:52:25.279 --> 02:52:26.900
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we have to go tomorrow.

02:52:32.265 --> 02:52:35.428
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just... They're plant people.

02:52:36.969 --> 02:52:38.551
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought there was going to be video of the Space Ponchos.

02:52:38.571 --> 02:52:39.451
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought so too.

02:52:39.471 --> 02:52:39.952
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the plant people.

02:52:39.992 --> 02:52:41.033
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck the plant people.

02:52:41.053 --> 02:52:42.394
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's bald dude in the Space Poncho?

02:52:42.454 --> 02:52:42.954
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:58.701
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be really hot with all those people wearing those silvery space ponchos.

02:52:58.741 --> 02:53:02.003
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if you can go on YouTube.

02:53:02.783 --> 02:53:03.584
[SPEAKER_14]: I love commenters.

02:53:03.624 --> 02:53:06.265
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering if YouTube has some space poncho.

02:53:06.885 --> 02:53:07.866
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they'd be on Twitter.

02:53:08.366 --> 02:53:13.348
[SPEAKER_14]: I know our boy Bobby Blackwolf is monitoring the Twitters right now.

02:53:14.689 --> 02:53:17.150
[SPEAKER_14]: And he will let us know the incident of space poncho.

02:53:17.170 --> 02:53:18.911
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he's trying to get the space poncho thing to trend.

02:53:19.051 --> 02:53:19.331
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Rob.

02:53:19.611 --> 02:53:19.811
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

02:53:19.851 --> 02:53:21.433
[SPEAKER_02]: SpacePacho5.

02:53:23.915 --> 02:53:24.216
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

02:53:24.276 --> 02:53:26.037
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, comments from chat room here.

02:53:26.137 --> 02:53:30.902
[SPEAKER_14]: BlackWolf has apparently also read it as an on-rails lightsaber game.

02:53:31.563 --> 02:53:31.803
[SPEAKER_14]: Weird.

02:53:33.991 --> 02:53:37.152
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about Star Wars, it's whatever

02:54:01.997 --> 02:54:02.978
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:54:17.293 --> 02:54:19.434
[SPEAKER_11]: Project Under $100 is back on.

02:54:19.474 --> 02:54:31.740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically, as I put it, an experiment in frugality and engineering that's basically going to be tasked in building a working MAME machine.

02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:37.282
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a PC in an arcade cabinet with arcade controls under $100.

02:54:37.322 --> 02:54:37.602
[SPEAKER_11]: That's easy.

02:54:40.089 --> 02:54:41.090
[SPEAKER_11]: You would think it would be.

02:54:41.631 --> 02:54:42.031
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

02:54:58.411 --> 02:55:02.176
[SPEAKER_11]: Buying everything for under $100, a lot harder than it sounds.

02:55:02.337 --> 02:55:04.019
[SPEAKER_02]: So donations don't count towards your under $100.

02:55:04.319 --> 02:55:05.461
[SPEAKER_11]: Donations do not count.

02:55:06.102 --> 02:55:07.204
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything must be purchased.

02:55:08.365 --> 02:55:14.133
[SPEAKER_11]: Except, of course, construction materials like tape or glue and that kind of stuff.

02:55:14.313 --> 02:55:15.375
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming that you have that.

02:55:15.475 --> 02:55:18.418
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say in my backyard I have an empty arcade cabinet.

02:55:18.438 --> 02:55:20.981
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a ton of controllers and buttons.

02:55:21.021 --> 02:55:21.842
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes.

02:55:21.922 --> 02:55:23.464
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's worst case scenario.

02:55:23.684 --> 02:55:27.829
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you wanted to and you didn't have anything, could you do it under $100?

02:55:27.869 --> 02:55:29.230
[SPEAKER_11]: And the answer is yes.

02:55:29.430 --> 02:55:30.331
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta get back to the phones.

02:55:30.371 --> 02:55:31.793
[SPEAKER_14]: They are blowing up, you guys.

02:55:31.813 --> 02:55:32.554
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you give out the URL?

02:55:33.126 --> 02:55:59.431
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, the URL is under $100 $100 is the number under$100mame.blogspot.com There'll be a link on Orange Lounge later By the way guys, we need a Space Poncho page on Wikipedia, like right now and get it created and then link it to all of us before On our wiki I would think official Wikipedia should have Space Poncho Both Let's get to another call, we gotta try and blow through these calls Our phone lines are blowing up tonight Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:56:00.091 --> 02:56:00.952
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, this is Ingo.

02:56:01.233 --> 02:56:02.494
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Ingo, what's on your mind?

02:56:02.534 --> 02:56:03.536
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we can hear you this time.

[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

02:56:04.637 --> 02:56:06.199
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a space poncho.

02:56:06.259 --> 02:56:06.800
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too!

02:56:07.942 --> 02:56:09.303
[SPEAKER_13]: Sadly, I have to work tomorrow.

02:56:09.343 --> 02:56:10.545
[SPEAKER_13]: Boo hoo.

02:56:10.565 --> 02:56:11.486
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you're sick?

02:56:12.528 --> 02:56:12.928
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

02:56:12.948 --> 02:56:16.153
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell is going on with these Microsoft pictures?

02:56:16.173 --> 02:56:17.695
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like cavemen that are emo.

02:56:19.195 --> 02:56:21.377
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, cavemen that are emo, Microsoft?

02:56:21.437 --> 02:56:23.258
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you talking about the pictures from the event, or what?

02:56:23.358 --> 02:56:29.743
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's the one where they're like, it's like on a hill, and they're like, there's the big ol' logo there, and there's a TV or something.

02:56:29.823 --> 02:56:32.706
[SPEAKER_14]: Cirque du Soleil is like that modern art thing, you know?

02:56:32.726 --> 02:56:35.068
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't you be emo if you didn't have fire?

02:56:37.229 --> 02:57:06.356
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be emo if my space poncho wasn't changing colors like it's supposed to imagine if the space ponchos glowed blue you're just giving me more reason to make you call in sick tomorrow not calling in sick tomorrow what else was I going to say what do you most want to see at E3 Ingo Medal of Honor and Power Gig do you know any rumors about these different series and where they're going I think Medal of Honor is going to blow Modern Warfare 2 out of the water

02:57:07.006 --> 02:57:08.187
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, them's fighting words.

02:57:08.247 --> 02:57:08.667
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is that?

02:57:09.667 --> 02:57:12.969
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's... I don't know.

02:57:13.449 --> 02:57:14.470
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it looks awesome.

02:57:14.630 --> 02:57:16.250
[SPEAKER_13]: And the guy looks like ZZ Top.

02:57:18.652 --> 02:57:19.892
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's a good reason right there.

02:57:20.713 --> 02:57:21.013
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

02:57:21.613 --> 02:57:27.536
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, I hope you enjoy E3 and all the news that's coming out of it and get some stuff.

02:57:27.556 --> 02:57:29.257
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?

02:57:29.837 --> 02:57:30.697
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an announcement.

02:57:30.917 --> 02:57:31.118
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

02:57:31.238 --> 02:57:33.018
[SPEAKER_13]: I officially quit Infinity Ward.

02:57:34.219 --> 02:57:35.039
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my gosh.

02:57:35.079 --> 02:57:36.280
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, did you work for Infinity Ward?

02:57:36.997 --> 02:57:37.297
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:57:37.678 --> 02:57:38.059
[SPEAKER_13]: You did?

02:57:38.779 --> 02:57:39.060
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:57:39.561 --> 02:57:40.181
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know that.

02:57:40.201 --> 02:57:40.442
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

02:57:40.522 --> 02:57:42.945
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know we had listeners of Infinity Ward listening to this show.

02:57:44.047 --> 02:57:44.768
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, okay.

02:57:45.849 --> 02:57:50.415
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I work for a different developer that I don't want to talk about.

02:57:50.996 --> 02:57:54.420
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we ask you why you quit Infinity Ward, or is it one of those, like, it ought to be obvious, Rob?

02:57:56.121 --> 02:57:56.481
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of.

02:57:56.942 --> 02:57:59.622
[SPEAKER_13]: Pre-shift contract on Activision's side.

02:58:00.182 --> 02:58:00.663
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

02:58:00.883 --> 02:58:01.203
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:58:01.743 --> 02:58:02.283
[SPEAKER_14]: How about that?

02:58:02.363 --> 02:58:03.723
[SPEAKER_14]: I had no idea.

02:58:03.823 --> 02:58:04.124
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:58:04.164 --> 02:58:08.125
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, good luck to you on your new endeavors, whatever they may be.

02:58:08.405 --> 02:58:09.165
[SPEAKER_14]: Will we see you at E3?

02:58:09.205 --> 02:58:10.445
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to be at E3?

02:58:10.585 --> 02:58:12.026
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because they don't let programmers really go.

02:58:12.046 --> 02:58:12.506
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably.

02:58:13.266 --> 02:58:13.826
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be there.

02:58:14.006 --> 02:58:15.347
[SPEAKER_13]: You just probably won't see me.

02:58:16.347 --> 02:58:17.367
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well, okay then.

02:58:17.547 --> 02:58:17.807
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:58:18.748 --> 02:58:20.608
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, say hello if you do happen to see us, all right?

02:58:20.948 --> 02:58:21.368
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

02:58:21.388 --> 02:58:21.748
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

02:58:21.788 --> 02:58:22.349
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good E3.

02:58:23.129 --> 02:58:23.389
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

02:58:23.949 --> 02:58:24.309
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:26.090
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knew?

02:58:26.130 --> 02:58:28.652
[SPEAKER_14]: How often were we covering those Infinity Ward stories?

02:58:28.692 --> 02:58:30.693
[SPEAKER_14]: We had somebody listening who worked on it.

02:58:31.053 --> 02:58:31.593
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know.

02:58:34.155 --> 02:58:35.716
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I really hate to do this to you.

02:58:36.196 --> 02:58:39.898
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hate to do it, but at the same time, it's E3, guys.

02:58:40.598 --> 02:58:41.219
[SPEAKER_14]: What now?

02:58:52.430 --> 02:58:57.253
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently SingStar has a new game that is being revealed at E3.

02:58:57.374 --> 02:59:00.716
[SPEAKER_14]: It is called SingStar Dance.

02:59:01.536 --> 02:59:04.919
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's being revealed at Sony's press conference on Tuesday morning.

02:59:05.359 --> 02:59:08.721
[SPEAKER_14]: It's supposedly compatible with the PS3 Move controllers.

02:59:08.761 --> 02:59:09.922
[SPEAKER_14]: SingStar Dance.

02:59:10.022 --> 02:59:11.883
[SPEAKER_14]: News is leaking out about that tonight.

02:59:11.963 --> 02:59:16.346
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to hold the microphone and the Move controllers in your hand, how is that going to work?

02:59:16.426 --> 02:59:17.547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you actually sing.

02:59:17.587 --> 02:59:18.648
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just a dance game.

02:59:18.688 --> 02:59:19.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Call it out.

02:59:19.088 --> 02:59:21.269
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a SingStar title.

02:59:22.431 --> 02:59:23.572
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:23.612 --> 02:59:23.993
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

02:59:24.935 --> 02:59:27.779
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Space Poncho-less SSJ100 Matt.

02:59:27.819 --> 02:59:30.504
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt, our Space Poncho-loving friend.

02:59:30.544 --> 02:59:31.245
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind, buddy?

02:59:32.332 --> 02:59:32.732
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

02:59:33.512 --> 02:59:41.695
[SPEAKER_08]: I quickly want to get your guys' thoughts on, you know, I have a feeling that this E3, they're going to be ramming the 3D gaming down our throats.

02:59:41.995 --> 02:59:42.235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

02:59:42.375 --> 02:59:43.275
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think?

02:59:44.035 --> 02:59:48.817
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it can go suck my dick because I am not a big fan of E3.

02:59:49.497 --> 02:59:50.257
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

02:59:51.798 --> 02:59:52.638
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to get cut.

02:59:52.998 --> 02:59:54.340
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a big fan of E3.

02:59:54.380 --> 02:59:54.820
[SPEAKER_14]: I love them.

02:59:55.180 --> 02:59:56.262
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 3D.

02:59:56.362 --> 03:00:00.206
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not a big fan of it because it makes me sick when it gets to that level.

03:00:00.286 --> 03:00:03.990
[SPEAKER_14]: Like watching Avatar in the theater for like two hours and all that.

03:00:04.551 --> 03:00:08.375
[SPEAKER_14]: I think all these games are just too much.

03:00:09.915 --> 03:00:13.179
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it if I have to buy a new TV and glasses for it.

03:00:13.579 --> 03:00:20.407
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I will probably support the 3DS because it's all built in and I won't have a problem with that.

03:00:20.427 --> 03:00:21.888
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to buy updates to games.

03:00:21.908 --> 03:00:23.090
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to buy special glasses.

03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:24.131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a $2,000 TV.

03:00:24.151 --> 03:00:27.254
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want a $2,000 TV, but I don't want it for that reason.

03:00:29.076 --> 03:00:56.826
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm extremely apprehensive about the 3DS but I will check it out and give it a fair shot and may I be wrong I will come out on the show Tuesday night you'll know I will post the little Rob Roberts and pals at E3 and if I'm wrong I will say I was wrong this thing is awesome if they have a Pokemon game I'm sold if you want to blame anyone for this whole 3D thing you gotta blame the TV makers because everyone now is buying everyone pretty much has an HDTV I don't know the exact numbers household wise but

03:00:58.054 --> 03:01:02.296
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to try to crank out new hardware, new stuff for people to buy.

03:01:02.656 --> 03:01:06.018
[SPEAKER_04]: The HD TVs and 3D TVs are completely different.

03:01:06.539 --> 03:01:15.604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, but everyone pretty much has an HD TV now, so they're trying to get people to get the new upgrade, the new tech.

03:01:16.084 --> 03:01:16.645
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

03:01:16.685 --> 03:01:18.486
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm turning this on you, SSJ100Mal.

03:01:18.506 --> 03:01:19.727
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think of 3D games?

03:01:21.428 --> 03:01:25.210
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it could work, but I don't think now is the proper time.

03:01:26.453 --> 03:01:27.294
[SPEAKER_14]: Now is too early.

03:01:27.354 --> 03:01:28.715
[SPEAKER_14]: This is all happening too fast.

03:01:28.795 --> 03:01:31.637
[SPEAKER_14]: The movies are one thing and then the rest is just too much.

03:01:32.197 --> 03:01:32.498
[SPEAKER_14]: Too much.

03:01:32.518 --> 03:01:39.102
[SPEAKER_08]: And when our economy is a little more stable, when we're able to be a little more frugal to go out and spend these $3,000 TVs with $150...

03:01:43.450 --> 03:02:02.905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll look into it but you know right now very little TV is 3D now I mean I know ESPN has jumped on it I know different sports are doing it but you know it's just too early let me ask you this real quick what thing at E3 are you looking forward to the most?

03:02:04.346 --> 03:02:09.710
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Microsoft to give us more games for live you know like 1 vs 100

03:02:11.263 --> 03:02:12.224
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are those games?

03:02:12.444 --> 03:02:13.505
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, whatever happened to that?

03:02:14.145 --> 03:02:15.466
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I want to see?

03:02:15.506 --> 03:02:16.707
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see them do Match Game.

03:02:17.428 --> 03:02:18.509
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love Match Game.

03:02:18.529 --> 03:02:19.550
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be amazing.

03:02:19.650 --> 03:02:20.390
[SPEAKER_14]: Match with thousands of people.

03:02:20.410 --> 03:02:28.237
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing we need to do is just hook up a couple of Xbox 360 Slims and revive Charles Nelson Reilly.

03:02:28.757 --> 03:02:29.898
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, that would be wonderful.

03:02:29.918 --> 03:02:31.139
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be great.

03:02:31.479 --> 03:02:37.304
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, as of today, we're going to let you go so we can get at least one more call here on this long-running show tonight, but thanks so much for your call.

03:02:37.924 --> 03:02:38.064
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

03:02:38.305 --> 03:02:38.765
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one, buddy.

03:02:40.408 --> 03:02:41.829
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess the Kinect event is over.

03:02:41.929 --> 03:02:42.870
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what Black Wolf says.

03:02:43.010 --> 03:02:44.131
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what happened.

03:02:44.651 --> 03:02:46.573
[SPEAKER_14]: People probably just walked out.

03:02:47.153 --> 03:02:48.394
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they walked out.

03:02:48.955 --> 03:02:50.596
[SPEAKER_14]: Did it blow people's minds?

03:02:50.676 --> 03:02:51.337
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I want to know.

03:02:51.377 --> 03:02:53.999
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it a mind-blowing experience?

03:02:54.999 --> 03:02:56.801
[SPEAKER_14]: Were your minds blown?

03:02:58.662 --> 03:02:59.383
[SPEAKER_14]: Last call of the night.

03:02:59.423 --> 03:03:00.404
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:00.424 --> 03:03:00.784
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

03:03:01.965 --> 03:03:07.109
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'd rather walk around and wear a space poncho throughout Manhattan than play Final Fantasy VIII again.

03:03:08.351 --> 03:03:09.412
[SPEAKER_14]: Amen to that.

03:03:09.953 --> 03:03:10.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.

03:03:10.833 --> 03:03:11.434
[SPEAKER_14]: I do both.

03:03:11.674 --> 03:03:11.994
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

03:03:12.455 --> 03:03:12.735
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:03:13.035 --> 03:03:15.417
[SPEAKER_14]: What is on your mind tonight, Ranma?

03:03:17.139 --> 03:03:19.401
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make this quick because I know you guys are running late.

03:03:19.421 --> 03:03:25.246
[SPEAKER_10]: About a few weeks back, I finally got my hands on Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero Van Halen.

03:03:27.427 --> 03:03:27.788
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

03:03:28.188 --> 03:03:30.450
[SPEAKER_14]: So first tell us about Beatles Rock Band.

03:03:31.551 --> 03:03:33.473
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only played a couple of tracks of it and...

03:03:34.514 --> 03:03:38.295
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, my personal opinion, I would not have paid $59.

03:03:38.435 --> 03:03:41.756
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have paid $39 or $49 for it.

03:03:41.796 --> 03:03:44.337
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, I got it on clearance for $9.99 at Target.

03:03:47.057 --> 03:03:47.778
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm, okay.

03:03:48.378 --> 03:03:50.018
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, $9.99 for Beatles?

03:03:50.698 --> 03:03:53.119
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, select stores at the time were clearing them out.

03:03:53.199 --> 03:03:54.819
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm walking in, just checking what they had.

03:03:55.259 --> 03:03:57.620
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Van Halen for $15 on clearance.

03:03:57.660 --> 03:04:00.701
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked over and saw Beatles for $10, so I grabbed that too.

03:04:03.852 --> 03:04:04.253
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

03:04:04.793 --> 03:04:10.680
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, and you like the game or it's kind of one of those, well, I'm really happy I didn't pay $60 for this.

03:04:11.421 --> 03:04:17.287
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really glad I didn't pay $60 for either game because I was really hyped for Guitar Hero Van Halen.

03:04:17.347 --> 03:04:18.048
[SPEAKER_10]: I really was.

03:04:18.328 --> 03:04:20.210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I started playing through it and I'm like...

03:04:21.195 --> 03:04:22.796
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not so hyped anymore.

03:04:23.356 --> 03:04:28.978
[SPEAKER_10]: And the one thing that pissed me off is that I'm halfway through the game with the drums.

03:04:29.018 --> 03:04:32.380
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured, let me finish up the other half of the game on guitar.

03:04:32.820 --> 03:04:36.122
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have to go through everything all over again with the guitar.

03:04:36.782 --> 03:04:38.042
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, screw this.

03:04:39.683 --> 03:04:40.183
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

03:04:41.284 --> 03:04:41.564
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:04:42.444 --> 03:04:44.325
[SPEAKER_14]: What about Van Halen, Guitar Hero?

03:04:45.126 --> 03:04:46.706
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one I was talking about.

03:04:46.986 --> 03:04:47.427
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

03:04:47.587 --> 03:04:48.227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

03:04:49.483 --> 03:04:53.064
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still hoping that one of my favorite songs is in the game, but I don't think it is.

03:04:53.164 --> 03:04:55.785
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just enjoyed the music.

03:04:55.825 --> 03:04:58.206
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the main reason why I got it in the first place.

03:04:58.746 --> 03:05:04.888
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, I think Activision really needs to step their game up because we just got Green Day Rock Band and well...

03:05:06.531 --> 03:05:11.954
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really liking that a lot more and I think that's how you really need to do the expansion titles, more like that.

03:05:12.194 --> 03:05:24.581
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of having practically all the songs unlocked and all you're doing is unlocking venues and so forth, start out with six or seven songs and start unlocking all the songs as you play.

03:05:28.724 --> 03:05:30.545
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you play the Green Day Rock Band by chance yet?

03:05:32.014 --> 03:05:33.195
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we have it here.

03:05:33.595 --> 03:05:35.035
[SPEAKER_10]: My roommate picked it up last week.

03:05:35.215 --> 03:05:36.316
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to line up an interview.

03:05:36.336 --> 03:05:41.918
[SPEAKER_14]: If I've seen out of it, I'm trying to line up an interview for the last part of the show here, so I'm half listening and half doing this.

03:05:42.518 --> 03:05:44.979
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry if I'm the only one engaging our caller right now.

03:05:44.999 --> 03:05:47.300
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a caller?

03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:53.483
[SPEAKER_10]: Before this is over, I want to throw in my two cents on this whole Project $10 bullshit.

03:05:53.703 --> 03:05:54.343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please do.

03:05:55.003 --> 03:05:56.684
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we just got his 10 cents.

03:05:57.944 --> 03:05:58.625
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bullshit.

03:05:58.745 --> 03:05:59.405
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

03:05:59.485 --> 03:06:06.987
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean to tell me after I spent 50 bucks on live, I gotta spend another $10 for online gaming?

03:06:07.828 --> 03:06:08.568
[SPEAKER_11]: If you buy used.

03:06:10.268 --> 03:06:10.448
[SPEAKER_01]: Used?

03:06:10.769 --> 03:06:13.169
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:21.052
[SPEAKER_11]: And remember, GameStop now is deducting $10 from the price of their games, so in a sense, it's not really going to be any more money.

03:06:22.765 --> 03:06:27.207
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but then the new game buyers get screwed because now their games are worth way less.

03:06:27.507 --> 03:06:28.767
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the trade-ins will be worth less.

03:06:29.728 --> 03:06:30.008
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't.

03:06:30.268 --> 03:06:31.108
[SPEAKER_11]: They pay for it either way.

03:06:32.109 --> 03:06:37.071
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're saying that this money's going to go pay for the servers and the people that admin it?

03:06:37.331 --> 03:06:38.832
[SPEAKER_10]: That's bullshit.

03:06:38.852 --> 03:06:45.514
[SPEAKER_10]: That money's going to upper management to fatten their pockets because I'm on that echelon of code monkeys and tech guys.

03:06:46.375 --> 03:06:49.356
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the underappreciated folk in this world.

03:06:50.507 --> 03:06:54.329
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course it was a bullshit corporate speak, but we knew that.

03:06:54.890 --> 03:06:59.572
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week, as I've been asking everybody tonight?

03:07:00.312 --> 03:07:12.959
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually looking forward to hearing all of what Microsoft has to say, what Nintendo has to say, and I'm really curious about this supposed price cut to $199 by Sony.

03:07:13.499 --> 03:07:17.901
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really curious about this, because I heard that twice, and I'm like, that's too good to be true.

03:07:19.182 --> 03:07:19.402
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

03:07:22.313 --> 03:07:23.655
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else you want to say about E3?

03:07:23.675 --> 03:07:26.558
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's pretty much it.

03:07:26.658 --> 03:07:27.158
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

03:07:27.439 --> 03:07:27.739
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:07:28.260 --> 03:07:33.545
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show here and get out and all that fun stuff.

03:07:33.605 --> 03:07:35.147
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you so much for your call.

03:07:35.187 --> 03:07:36.629
[SPEAKER_14]: And sorry I was only like half listening.

03:07:36.669 --> 03:07:38.110
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes here.

03:07:38.210 --> 03:07:38.571
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad.

03:07:39.151 --> 03:07:39.632
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

03:07:39.672 --> 03:07:40.353
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you, too.

03:07:40.393 --> 03:07:41.574
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wait till you come out to Brooklyn.

03:07:41.614 --> 03:07:42.255
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, goody, goody.

03:07:42.355 --> 03:07:42.635
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:07:42.655 --> 03:07:43.096
[SPEAKER_14]: Mwah, mwah.

03:07:44.566 --> 03:07:46.167
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the skyline.

03:07:46.207 --> 03:07:53.533
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry guys, we're getting hammered tonight, but so many of you didn't get through and I'm sorry, but please feel free to send us some emails.

03:07:54.333 --> 03:08:01.479
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to get through a little in a different way, I guess you could say.

03:08:01.939 --> 03:08:07.903
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go ahead and go around and kind of start to wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:08:07.983 --> 03:08:09.384
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be an awesome E3.

03:08:09.444 --> 03:08:10.225
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited.

03:08:10.265 --> 03:08:12.467
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope I'm not sick or I'm going to be fucking mad.

03:08:13.087 --> 03:08:18.008
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll bring you, again, special shows Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, as soon as we can get them posted.

03:08:18.048 --> 03:08:20.048
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't see anything Tuesday night, don't freak out.

03:08:20.569 --> 03:08:21.409
[SPEAKER_14]: Something just went wrong.

03:08:21.449 --> 03:08:22.629
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to get an internet connection.

03:08:23.209 --> 03:08:24.930
[SPEAKER_14]: Or we went to play DJ Max.

03:08:25.010 --> 03:08:25.370
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps.

03:08:26.310 --> 03:08:27.450
[SPEAKER_14]: So, final thoughts.

03:08:27.490 --> 03:08:27.890
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we ready?

03:08:28.070 --> 03:08:28.930
[SPEAKER_02]: My water's boiling.

03:08:29.610 --> 03:08:29.831
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:08:29.851 --> 03:08:30.711
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, bye, Dark Sakura.

03:08:30.871 --> 03:08:31.691
[SPEAKER_14]: At least it's not breaking.

03:08:32.211 --> 03:08:32.491
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:08:33.951 --> 03:08:35.132
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:08:36.952 --> 03:08:41.453
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is this week will be fun to watch all the different press conferences.

03:08:42.355 --> 03:08:45.318
[SPEAKER_14]: My final thought is I'm excited to go home and take some NyQuil!

03:08:45.418 --> 03:08:46.098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

03:08:46.819 --> 03:08:49.441
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's one last thing I wanted to think about here.

03:08:49.982 --> 03:08:50.622
[SPEAKER_11]: Ponder, maybe.

03:08:51.223 --> 03:08:56.427
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if we'll have space ponchos for our avatars on Xbox Live.

03:08:57.648 --> 03:08:58.349
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be amazing.

03:08:59.270 --> 03:09:00.531
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd absolutely be amazing.

03:09:01.503 --> 03:09:03.004
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov, thank you for being here.

03:09:03.064 --> 03:09:05.666
[SPEAKER_14]: You came out all the way from Kansas just to be on the show, I'm sure.

03:09:05.847 --> 03:09:07.908
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was exactly my reason.

03:09:08.109 --> 03:09:09.430
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing to do with E3 or Technica.

03:09:09.630 --> 03:09:11.171
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostly Technica.

03:09:11.612 --> 03:09:12.613
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have any final thoughts?

03:09:13.754 --> 03:09:25.645
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I hope that leaked floor plans for E3 are true and I get to play Pokemon Black and White and see Dragon Age 2 because those are probably the games that will be my highlights of the show.

03:09:26.365 --> 03:09:26.645
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:09:26.945 --> 03:09:27.566
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we'll see.

03:09:27.646 --> 03:09:30.867
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just a few days away from the show floor being open.

03:09:30.907 --> 03:09:31.887
[SPEAKER_14]: It's less than 48 hours.

03:09:32.588 --> 03:09:33.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Excited.

03:09:33.148 --> 03:09:33.388
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:09:33.868 --> 03:09:39.690
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see you in a couple days with the Rob Robertson Pals special from E3, and then we will all be here in studio next week.

03:09:39.810 --> 03:09:41.151
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, DarkSakura, and myself.

03:09:41.231 --> 03:09:43.392
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki and DarkSakura will be scouring up and down the internet.

03:09:43.892 --> 03:09:44.894
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys for listening to our show.

03:09:44.914 --> 03:09:47.617
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for subscribing to our podcast or listening live, however you're doing it.

03:09:58.832 --> 03:10:02.818
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show.

03:10:03.098 --> 03:10:06.823
[SPEAKER_14]: Help us spread the word because we're not a big, we can't afford a booth at E3.

[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just put it that way.

03:10:07.985 --> 03:10:09.948
[SPEAKER_14]: Make sure that you help spread the word.

03:10:10.088 --> 03:10:12.992
[SPEAKER_14]: That is how we get more people exposed.

03:10:13.012 --> 03:10:15.355
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you afford a taco stand outside E3?

03:10:16.236 --> 03:10:17.437
[SPEAKER_14]: You heard the caller earlier.

03:10:17.497 --> 03:10:19.059
[SPEAKER_14]: You wish you'd known about this eight years ago.

03:10:19.159 --> 03:10:20.440
[SPEAKER_14]: So all you gotta do, tell your friend.

03:10:20.480 --> 03:10:20.760
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:21.641
