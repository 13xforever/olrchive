00:00.000 --> 00:19.720
Tonight, June 6th, 2010, a lawsuit is filed against Final Fantasy XIII.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.880
Rumors say a new dance game is coming to Project Atoll, and could you soon pay a new tax on

00:23.880 --> 00:31.760
your consumer electronics?

00:31.760 --> 00:35.840
Hello my friends and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.720
We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.720 --> 00:47.680
It is episode number 369 for this June the 6th of 2010, 69.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.680
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.400
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.840
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:54.840 --> 00:55.840
Hi.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.840
How are you?

00:56.840 --> 00:57.840
Ahhh.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.520
I see, needing a good oiling apparently.

01:01.520 --> 01:08.180
This is the first day I've actually felt somewhat decent, so I've been sick, but I am mostly

01:08.180 --> 01:09.940
over it, a little leftover.

01:09.940 --> 01:11.640
My voice may go out during the show.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.640
You know what you need?

01:12.640 --> 01:13.640
A lozenge.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.240
You need, well that, and you need salad.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.040
Because I took, I had salad today.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.400
I went to, just like, for anybody who listened to last week's show, I went to Fresh Choice,

01:22.400 --> 01:23.400
just like Jamie.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.720
I saw your picture of your lovely salad.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.520
I sent you a tweet.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.400
But I have been eating salad all weekend.

01:28.400 --> 01:32.160
I had an epic salad yesterday, Rob.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.160
Get this.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.560
And so there's different levels of salad.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.900
There's like, you know, there's level one salad, your like basic house salad, then there's

01:38.900 --> 01:40.920
epic salad of awesomeness.

01:40.920 --> 01:49.840
My epic salad had used red vein chard, which chard is delicious, and raw squash, and roma

01:49.840 --> 01:59.160
tomatoes, and dehydrated apples, and chives, and, what else did I put in that thing?

01:59.160 --> 02:01.880
Because I put a lot of, oh, pea sprouts.

02:01.880 --> 02:02.880
Pea shoots, sorry, pea shoots.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.880
And broccoli.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.120
And occasionally we do talk about video games here at Orange Lawns Radio.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.120
With a raspberry vinaigrette.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.120
Now is that-

02:08.120 --> 02:10.840
But don't put your video games in raspberry vinaigrette, it won't work anymore.

02:10.840 --> 02:11.840
Epic.

02:11.840 --> 02:12.840
It sounds pretty epic.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.840
It was really good.

02:13.840 --> 02:14.840
Alright.

02:14.840 --> 02:15.840
I'm gonna have gelato today.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.240
Also here, I've got to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.240
Hello.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.240
How are you doing, Loki?

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
I'm full.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.240
You're full?

02:22.240 --> 02:23.240
What have you been eating?

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
Not a salad.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
I can see that.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.240
I don't know, breadsticks.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.240
Breadsticks.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.240
Yeah.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.240
This should be like a food MMO.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.240
I don't know.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.240
Let's go to Sizzler, the MMO.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.240
No.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.240
Don't need that.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.240
Alright.

02:36.240 --> 02:44.200
Anyhow, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.640
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:47.640 --> 02:54.440
So, do pull up a chair and join us in our chat room if you are listening live, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.480
We're gonna be talking video games over the next few hours.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.520
Tonight, lots of E3 rumors and kind of things.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.480
You know, we're in that period where E3 is, you know, right around the corner.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.840
Obviously, we're, what, eight days away from the first?

03:05.840 --> 03:06.840
No.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.560
Actually, we're one week away from the first press conference.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.920
If you count the Cirque du Soleil project, the tall thing, where they're gonna announce

03:13.920 --> 03:19.600
the real name of it, which I heard a little rumor, take it with a grain of salt, Xbox

03:19.600 --> 03:20.600
Wave.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.600
Oh, no.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
How would you feel about that as the name?

03:22.600 --> 03:26.960
Do you think that's a good name for a peripheral, Xbox Wave?

03:26.960 --> 03:27.960
It's interesting.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.360
I could see them doing little like tidal waves.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.260
Jamie's like waving her hand.

03:31.260 --> 03:33.320
At least it's not the Xbox Flail.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.240
That's I guess a little better.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.280
That's, that would be if they put Para Para on it.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.280
We'll see.

03:39.280 --> 03:40.680
Take that with a gigantic grain of salt.

03:40.680 --> 03:46.360
I was, I just had a thought about the Natal thing and Para Para.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.360
What's that?

03:47.360 --> 03:48.600
Could you imagine that?

03:48.600 --> 03:49.600
It could happen.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.880
We actually have a story a little later on about what might be happening with Natal and

03:52.880 --> 03:53.880
music based games.

03:53.880 --> 03:54.880
It's very interesting.

03:54.880 --> 03:55.880
So we'll be getting into that a little while.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.960
Xbox just made me think about it and I was like, Pala Pala.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.160
This is gonna be a very interesting E3.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.120
Like, you know, last year's, I'm gonna admit, I'm just gonna be honest.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.840
I was kind of disappointed with last year's E3.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.840
I mean, sure.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.840
So was I.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
I didn't even go.

04:09.840 --> 04:13.040
There was a few things that came out of it that were kind of, you know, kind of cool.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.920
But otherwise the show was just kind of like a lot of it was behind closed doors.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.280
A lot of it was more conceptual because you had, you know, Natal and Moov being announced

04:21.280 --> 04:27.280
but nothing, and I guess the Vitality sensor to some extent, but nothing really being shown.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.840
You know, so I think this year we're really gonna see what is going to be out on the shelves

04:31.840 --> 04:32.840
this Christmas.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.400
And there's gonna be a lot fighting for your attention this year.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
It'll be very interesting.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.360
I like when things fight for my attention.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.360
All right.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.360
Usually to the death.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.240
Well, we'll be getting into E3 and rumors and news and all that in just a little bit.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.400
We are gonna start off tonight's show as we always do, however, with a little bit of how

04:46.400 --> 04:47.400
was your gaming week.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.640
So what was fighting to the death for your attention this week in your gaming world,

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
Dark Sakura?

04:51.640 --> 04:57.520
Well, as I was playing just a moment ago, I was playing some Portal, but I really have

04:57.520 --> 05:05.080
to owe it to a lot of Star Trek Online because I realized that I had three more ranks to

05:05.080 --> 05:11.520
go before I hit Commander and damn it, I'm almost there because I want that extra pip.

05:11.520 --> 05:17.920
Other than that, I also canned two of my crewmen and now have this weird purple dude or purple

05:17.920 --> 05:24.160
chick who just is bizarre looking, but she's got good stats or whatever.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.800
And I have to say the crystalline entity is a bitch.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
What is that?

05:29.800 --> 05:30.800
Okay.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.800
What is the crystal?

05:31.800 --> 05:32.800
I don't.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.800
I'm not a big enough nerd.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.800
It was a next generation foe.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.860
Okay.

05:35.860 --> 05:41.440
And it's this big crystal thing, spiky crystal thing floating in space.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.280
And in the show, they use a high pitched noisy.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.240
Did they inject the warp core to fix it?

05:45.240 --> 05:46.240
No.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.240
Because that's always how you fix the problem.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.240
You inject the warp core.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.240
They pretty much screamed at it.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.240
Oh, okay.

05:50.240 --> 05:51.240
Pretty much screamed at it.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.320
They used a high pitch harmonic or something.

05:53.320 --> 05:58.240
So you're saying that the purple chick is a butter face.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.880
She looks strange, but she has good stats.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.040
Okay.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.680
She has a nice body butter face.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.400
Is that what it is?

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
Yes.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
Okay.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.400
Whatever.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.400
Anyway.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:11.760 --> 06:12.760
Do we find a picture?

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
No.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.000
Uh, I want to ask you something Star Trek related.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.560
Have you heard the commercials on the radio?

06:18.560 --> 06:23.280
There is the Star Trek tour is apparently like right around the corner from my house.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.280
Yes.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
And McClellan.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
Yeah.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.280
That's not giving away where I live on the show, but that's right around the corner of

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
my house.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
Yeah.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
It's like one exit up the freeway.

06:31.280 --> 06:32.280
Oh, I didn't know.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.280
Yes.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.280
Oh, I know.

06:34.280 --> 06:35.280
Sorry.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
Well, now you know.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.280
And now the entire internet knows where I live.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.280
Send us cards and letters.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.280
I thought you lived in the butt end the other way.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
No.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.440
Dan's in the other room singing, knowing it's half the battle.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.020
We need to get Dan a mic in the living room.

06:43.020 --> 06:46.920
We need to get like a, we need to get like a really long cord just so Dan can give his

06:46.920 --> 06:51.280
MST 3k commentary during the show for the living room.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.280
Anyway.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.780
Well, why, how have you not gone yet?

06:54.780 --> 06:57.520
Are we going, are we going to have a date?

06:57.520 --> 06:59.840
I'm going to take you on a date to the Star Trek tour.

06:59.840 --> 07:02.120
Are you going to give me dinner and flowers?

07:02.120 --> 07:04.560
Um, sure.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.280
I'll go steal some flowers from the apartment complex.

07:07.280 --> 07:12.320
I picked them in the front and then, uh, you know, by, by dinner and flowers, um, he's

07:12.320 --> 07:16.360
going to get me that Saturn game where you raise plants and a burger time and then we'll

07:16.360 --> 07:18.640
have some fava beans and a nice can team.

07:18.640 --> 07:26.520
Anyway, um, but what I was thinking about the crystal and this is, this is an open letter

07:26.520 --> 07:31.160
of annoyance to people who play Star Trek online.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.120
First of all, the crystalline entity thing is an open instance.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.180
That means anyone can join it.

07:36.180 --> 07:41.660
Even the most retarded of the retarded, the buttharted can join this instance.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.400
Do not use mines.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.400
Do not use mines.

07:45.400 --> 07:48.800
The way that you beat the stupid thing is you eject the warp core breach.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.200
That's how you kill it.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.320
The way that you kill the thing is that when you get it down to 30% it's going to shoot

07:54.320 --> 07:56.400
out these large crystals.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.200
Don't shoot the fragments, shoot the big crystals because the big crystals go back and regenerate

08:00.200 --> 08:02.720
the damn thing and then it shoots out everything and kills you.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.320
We can't do it, captain.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.800
We don't have the power.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.540
Just people think strategy, please.

08:10.540 --> 08:12.760
Does anybody ever yell that in Star Trek online?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.640
We don't have the power.

08:14.640 --> 08:15.640
No.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.560
I'm sure somewhere somebody has.

08:18.560 --> 08:21.720
They keep mentioning Worf.

08:21.720 --> 08:25.640
And I actually enjoy all the instances that involve the Klingons because they're so much

08:25.640 --> 08:27.640
fun.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.480
I'm really enjoying the game, okay?

08:29.480 --> 08:32.360
And Rob, you were supposed to play with me.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.720
I will use the pass.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.720
I will.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.120
Let's just, you know, World of Warcraft addict, et cetera.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.120
Okay, look.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.120
I'm looking in our chat room.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.600
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

08:40.600 --> 08:45.000
And SSJ100Matt is saying that Tigerclaw has already found my house, apparently.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Oh, no.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Loki's house.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
What was it?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
I don't know.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.600
Well, because Tigerclaw is the expert in our chat room.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.600
Like, if we mention something, he'll have a link in five seconds.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.600
He's amazing.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.480
His Google flu is unmatched.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.480
Let's see.

08:58.480 --> 09:02.120
SSJ100Matt also commenting on the date between Dark Soccer and myself.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.120
Rob better put out.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.120
Yeah, Rob.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.120
Yeah.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.080
Put out the credit card to pay the bill.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.080
That's what I'll be putting out.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.080
That's right.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.080
All right.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.080
Let's see.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
And then, where was there?

09:15.080 --> 09:16.080
There was another one I wanted to say.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.080
Oh, yes.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.080
BobbyBlackWolf, our old pal buddy friend who does the show before us here at All Games

09:20.080 --> 09:21.080
Radio.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.080
He is hatin' on split second.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.200
Like, if you listen to his show tonight, it's just an hour of split second bashing.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.440
Not really, but it might as well have been.

09:27.440 --> 09:32.720
He says in his gaming week, he ejected the warp core breach that is split second, because

09:32.720 --> 09:34.320
he is not a fan, apparently, of split second.

09:34.320 --> 09:38.240
I have not played split second outside the demo, but maybe next week I'll have more of

09:38.240 --> 09:43.440
an opinion, and I'll either eject Bobby's opinion from the warp core or whatever.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.440
I don't know.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
We'll see.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.120
Well, I also have to say the thing that Dan's been playing, because I have totally just

09:49.120 --> 09:50.660
gotten a kick out of watching him play it.

09:50.660 --> 09:53.120
We don't have the other controller hooked up where I'd play it, because you can play

09:53.120 --> 09:57.880
simultaneous on it, is Super Mario Brothers X.

09:57.880 --> 10:02.360
Speaking of pals from All Games Radio, I noticed Derek H. from Dead Pixel Live is in our chat

10:02.360 --> 10:05.440
room, and if you don't listen to Dead Pixel Live, you're an idiot.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.800
It's on Monday through Thursday at All Games Radio, so they do lots of shows.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.140
And he's asking a good question I want to pose to Jamie.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.020
Is Star Trek Online anything like you're in the show?

10:15.020 --> 10:20.200
I did tell him that it's pretty episode-like and that I love it, but I will give a little

10:20.200 --> 10:22.240
bit more of an apt description.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.240
Okay.

10:23.240 --> 10:29.660
You have, you basically talk to your commanders, you can talk to them, be a subspace, and you

10:29.660 --> 10:30.980
get your missions.

10:30.980 --> 10:36.520
So you go to whatever system, sometimes it's just a patrol, sometimes you think you're

10:36.520 --> 10:41.640
going to some abandoned place to look on some research that you don't know why it killed

10:41.640 --> 10:44.840
everybody, and oh, the Romulans are there.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.080
Which is everything I was doing today.

10:48.080 --> 10:54.820
Sometimes you go, actually we had a Section 31 guy pull like a big double switch.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.080
I don't want to go into detail in case you play the game, because honestly the whole

10:58.080 --> 11:04.640
thing with this game for me is that it really is like, I look forward to the story.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.960
Every mission that you go through through the game forwards the story.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.760
And you know, they do new episodes with new missions and everything, and I think that

11:12.760 --> 11:18.520
that's pretty sweet, but really it's like you're playing through seasons of the show.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.520
For me, that is.

11:19.520 --> 11:24.960
I mean, and yeah, there's times where I'll scream at the stupid, you know, the Romulan,

11:24.960 --> 11:28.480
the Romulan medics are the worst because like, shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate, shoot, shoot,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.360
shoot, regenerate, shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate.

11:30.360 --> 11:36.680
But they really do, you know, pay a lot of attention to canon in this too.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.520
Like now, I've been reading the books.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.040
Keep in mind, this is a different universe than the books.

11:42.040 --> 11:45.600
The books were written before the new movie came out, and this is incorporating the new

11:45.600 --> 11:50.040
movie into the storyline, so basically Romulus go boom.

11:50.040 --> 11:56.000
Morph gets pissed off at everybody, pissed off.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.280
It really is like a good continuation, but it says something like 20 years later, so

12:01.280 --> 12:04.720
like you actually run into people who were children in the series.

12:04.720 --> 12:10.120
Like you run into Maral Paris, and you run into Kiriyoshi O'Brien, and it's really neat.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.080
I mean, it really is like being in the universe.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.560
Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.680
No, it's cool.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
It's cool.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.040
I do want to play a little more.

12:19.040 --> 12:24.200
I only played during the beta, and I wasn't totally absorbed with it, so it was the space

12:24.200 --> 12:25.360
combat turned me off.

12:25.360 --> 12:29.280
I liked the away team mode, but I didn't like the space combat at all.

12:29.280 --> 12:33.080
Actually, Rob, they've really, really addressed a lot of problems with space combat.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.080
Okay, cool.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.080
It's a lot smoother now.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.400
But the other thing too is that once you get a little bit more used to the controls, it

12:39.400 --> 12:41.200
actually is really fluid.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.200
Now, you and I may have had the same problem.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.400
My graphics card was crap.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.520
I fixed that though, and now I can run wow at like highest settings, and it's purty.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.520
Well, then you should have no problem.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.960
When I upgraded my graphics card, a lot of my problems with control stopped because I

12:57.960 --> 12:58.960
wasn't lagging.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.960
Okay, cool.

12:59.960 --> 13:04.040
Because it would literally, now the difference between graphics card lag is that it would

13:04.040 --> 13:06.360
be stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter.

13:06.360 --> 13:10.680
And internet lag is that you'll go forward, you'll row back a few steps, and you'll go

13:10.680 --> 13:12.440
forward again.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.600
But that's very few and far between.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.680
It's just a little lag, and it looks like you've gone back like a millimeter on the

13:19.680 --> 13:20.680
screen.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.960
Wow lag can suck when it's like seconds and seconds of lag.

13:23.960 --> 13:24.960
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.840
Yeah, just everything kind of freezes in place, and then everything happens in like half a

13:28.840 --> 13:29.840
second.

13:29.840 --> 13:30.840
I hate it.

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
Oh, it was bad.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.360
I mean, usually the game doesn't get too laggy, but when you get those lag spikes, oh man,

13:35.360 --> 13:36.360
world of hurt.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.360
No, I hated it.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.160
I mean, that was one of the reasons.

13:39.160 --> 13:43.200
I like the lag in Star Trek Online a lot better than the lag in World of Warcraft.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.920
In fact, I actually don't like World of Warcraft, so that helps.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.920
Well, I tried.

13:46.920 --> 13:47.920
Nine, eight.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.800
I got a character to 20, Rob.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
I know.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.800
I got one to 20.

13:51.800 --> 13:52.800
I know.

13:52.800 --> 14:01.080
So yeah, if anyone wants to play with me, just saying, my whole account name is DarkSakura.

14:01.080 --> 14:06.600
My character's name is Edarn, E-D-A-R-Y-N.

14:06.600 --> 14:11.180
So yeah, I'm playing a Trill, whatever, because Trills are cool.

14:11.180 --> 14:14.360
And so, yeah, we need a fleet, we need the O.L. Army fleet.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.360
So there you go.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.880
You can stalk DarkSakura on Star Trek Online.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
Yeah.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.200
I am right now hanging out in Romulan space.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.880
Anyway, what I was going to say about Super Mario Bros. X.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.880
Yes.

14:25.880 --> 14:26.880
It's a Flash game.

14:26.880 --> 14:34.120
You go to SuperMarioBrothers.org, and you know, I'll spell it out all over the word.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.680
Not B-R-O-S, not Bros.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.680
No, not Bros.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.840
You have to do the full brothers.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.560
Brothers, yeah.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.160
But you can download the Flash game.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.440
Dan's actually running it through our computer that's hooked up to our TV, so he plays it

14:46.440 --> 14:49.600
at 52 inch widescreen.

14:49.600 --> 14:54.880
But it's basically a rehashing of the Mario levels and things done in different, like

14:54.880 --> 14:59.560
I love the first game on the list, it's called the Princess Cliche.

14:59.560 --> 15:04.480
But it's basically this guy's made different, you know, Mario, Super Mario games that'll

15:04.480 --> 15:09.360
have elements from Super Mario World, Super Mario 3s, even the flurries from Super Mario

15:09.360 --> 15:10.840
2 are in the level.

15:10.840 --> 15:14.520
I thought it was a very good looking game, I mean, it just looked like Super Mario World.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.720
At least the little bit I saw, I didn't, you know, Dan tried to show it to me in about

15:17.720 --> 15:20.600
10 seconds, like, you gotta check this out, but I...

15:20.600 --> 15:23.480
He was playing levels last night that are really reminiscent of Super Mario 3.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.800
Well the part that made me go, oh neat, is that it was two players simultaneous.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.800
Yeah.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.360
Kind of like the new Wii game is all simultaneous.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.360
Yeah.

15:30.360 --> 15:35.120
Well, we and I haven't played it together yet, but I have to say that it's, dude who

15:35.120 --> 15:36.880
made that game, well done.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.440
Very much well done.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.960
Enjoy it while it lasts before Nintendo sues the pants off those people, although there

15:41.960 --> 15:46.520
is a big splash screen that's basically the equivalent of please don't sue me, I love

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
Nintendo.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
They've been around for a while though.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
Has it?

15:49.520 --> 15:50.520
Yeah, it's been around for a while.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.240
Yeah, well, like, the game on, one of the games he has on there is like the first one

15:52.240 --> 15:58.040
he ever did, which is really annoying because all you ever get is mushrooms in it, but it's,

15:58.040 --> 16:01.280
it's really, it's really, he did a great job, like there's this one level that Dan was going

16:01.280 --> 16:07.440
through where you have to, you get the buzzy beetle shells and you have to break purple

16:07.440 --> 16:10.240
blocks with them so you have to get to the purple blocks and everything to unlock a door

16:10.240 --> 16:15.760
and it really, it's got some definitely creative elements in it, I'm, I'm pretty, I think it's

16:15.760 --> 16:20.240
pretty cool when I have some time that I'm not feeling like, you know, crap, I'll play

16:20.240 --> 16:21.240
it.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.240
Alright.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.680
Well, let's move on with our gaming weeks.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.440
We're almost 20 minutes, and Darsaki, you played a lot tonight, actually most of that

16:27.440 --> 16:28.440
was Star Trek Babble.

16:28.440 --> 16:29.440
That's okay.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.440
I also still had to do a plug.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.440
Oh, yes.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.440
Well, let's do it during housekeeping.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.440
Okay.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.760
Because I, there, I do want to give that plug as well.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.480
Uh, Loki, what did you, oh, you're, you're chowing down over there.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.840
You ready to talk about gaming week?

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
Almost done eating.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
Alright.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.840
Sorry.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.840
Bad time.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.840
You want me to go my gaming week then?

16:43.840 --> 16:44.840
No, I'm ready.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.840
Okay.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
Okay.

16:46.840 --> 16:52.000
So this week I played really only three things, um, Red Dead Redemption, played a lot more

16:52.000 --> 16:59.880
system link co-op and the game is surprisingly, I don't know how to really put it, the system

16:59.880 --> 17:05.640
link games, we have trouble staying in the same game, like it will have trouble joining

17:05.640 --> 17:06.640
a system link game.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.880
I have never seen a game that has trouble joining a system link game.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.640
And the system link game means your Xbox are connected.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.800
You're not even on the internet.

17:13.800 --> 17:18.920
You are literally connected table to table and it's just like, can't find the other Xbox.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.360
It's like, oh, you're in your own game and I have to find a new game.

17:21.360 --> 17:22.880
Oh, you're in your own game again.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.880
Find new game up.

17:23.880 --> 17:24.880
There he is.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.840
And we're like, we know we finished the mission or whatever co-op mission is split us off

17:28.840 --> 17:30.040
into two different games again.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.020
I'm like, what the hell is wrong with this thing?

17:33.020 --> 17:34.960
But yeah, it's very buggy.

17:34.960 --> 17:42.600
Um, we had issues with, um, where we were playing and we got dynamite and the molotovs

17:42.600 --> 17:43.840
and stuff like that.

17:43.840 --> 17:52.280
And it stopped showing us the explosions and the blood splurts and also the fire.

17:52.280 --> 17:56.800
And then my friend had trouble going through a gate because on our screen, the gate was

17:56.800 --> 17:57.800
open.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.000
On our screen, the gate was shut and locked.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.600
So it was interesting.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.720
But um, yeah, it's, it's still really fun.

18:06.720 --> 18:12.520
Um, I haven't gotten to play a lot of online cause trying to join games online, at least

18:12.520 --> 18:15.480
at our work where connection's not so great.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.880
Um, it's near impossible to do it.

18:17.880 --> 18:23.120
So we just basically stick to System Link games cause at least that way if live drops,

18:23.120 --> 18:29.160
which it does all the time on our, um, connection there at work, it doesn't matter.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.420
So that's kind of fun.

18:31.420 --> 18:38.960
And then also this week I went and played, um, some Grand Theft Auto, lost, er, not lost

18:38.960 --> 18:42.920
in damn, but, uh, Battle of the Gay Tony, more of the Episodes of Liberty City stuff.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.320
Um, still playing through that.

18:44.320 --> 18:48.800
I'm actually still moving up the ranks cause I haven't lost a game in a few weeks.

18:48.800 --> 18:55.920
Um, I'm 63 now, which is pretty cool, and really frustrating the hell out of my coworkers

18:55.920 --> 19:00.800
cause they're getting pissed off now that I don't lose any games.

19:00.800 --> 19:05.720
They're saying, because there was a guy that used to play with us named Chris Marsh and

19:05.720 --> 19:10.300
they're saying he, what I'm doing is very Marshian because he would, you know, pull

19:10.300 --> 19:15.680
off these just crazy ass, um, kills and stuff.

19:15.680 --> 19:22.280
Like for example, in the old, um, PSP game, uh, Liberty City Stories, it was very glitched

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
out.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.740
I mean we had problems with like teleporting grenades and whatever, um, but he actually

19:26.740 --> 19:28.600
got one kill one time.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.640
He actually got two kills out of one death.

19:31.640 --> 19:35.880
It was just ridiculous because he killed somebody and somehow they had just driven over like

19:35.880 --> 19:39.340
health or something and then they got a second death.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.840
So he got two points for where he should have only gotten one.

19:42.840 --> 19:49.880
I've actually gotten assists off of, um, what was it, assists off of my own death.

19:49.880 --> 19:55.000
So I actually got points for me dying, which makes zero sense whatsoever cause you're not

19:55.000 --> 19:56.280
supposed to be able to do that.

19:56.280 --> 20:00.840
And it's not my fault, it's just the game is really glitchy and, you know, that's just

20:00.840 --> 20:02.560
the way things are.

20:02.560 --> 20:07.440
Speaking of glitchy games, I've gone back to Earth Defense Force 2017 and I am going

20:07.440 --> 20:08.760
to beat it this time.

20:08.760 --> 20:16.920
We actually, um, were playing some more and, uh, just going through the game and, uh, almost

20:16.920 --> 20:18.140
finished with the game now.

20:18.140 --> 20:21.320
So I will be finishing that game hopefully soon.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.240
Kind of, uh, just had to dust it off again.

20:24.240 --> 20:28.000
Actually cracked my copy, but thankfully a while back I bought the last three copies

20:28.000 --> 20:29.840
we had for five dollars each.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.840
Nice.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.040
So I have spares.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.260
Wow.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.000
You should, I don't know, give one of those away as a prize.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.920
I was playing on it some day, but I cracked the copy.

20:37.920 --> 20:38.920
Endorsed by Loki edition.

20:38.920 --> 20:39.920
It's awesome.

20:39.920 --> 20:40.920
I bet the developers would love that.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.920
Alright, uh, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

20:44.920 --> 20:48.240
Um, that's pretty much it as far as stuff I've played.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.960
I'm kind of working on something right now.

20:49.960 --> 20:54.720
Well, I'm working on a lot of things cause that's just the way things work.

20:54.720 --> 21:01.160
Um, working on painting the baby's room, which is game related because it's New Super Mario

21:01.160 --> 21:02.420
Brothers themed.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.420
That's gonna be cute.

21:03.420 --> 21:04.920
You just need to put pictures on the, um, LR feed.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.580
Oh yeah, there will be tons of pictures.

21:06.580 --> 21:07.960
That's gonna be pimped out.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.920
We got some of the wall decals, but we're gonna paint a lot of it, but we want the wall

21:11.920 --> 21:14.000
decals for the characters and some of the other stuff.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.320
You're doing Mario you said?

21:15.320 --> 21:17.440
Yeah, New Super Mario Brothers theme.

21:17.440 --> 21:22.840
I have a plan I can give you to make hampers look like the, um, the pipes.

21:22.840 --> 21:23.840
Huh.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.600
Well, I'll have to look at that.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.160
Cause I was just gonna get giant PVC and make it into a pipe, but.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.440
That was, well, it's something that I had planned cause that's what Dan and I were gonna

21:32.440 --> 21:33.440
do.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.440
Cool.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.680
And then I got some other stuff from ThinkGeek.

21:36.680 --> 21:42.520
Uh, like I got a, it was a open source, uh, music box.

21:42.520 --> 21:46.280
So we have it so that you can make the Super Mario Brothers theme on that.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.640
And then some Mario figurines.

21:48.640 --> 21:55.520
And we're planning on doing some, um, uh, question block shelving and custom carpet

21:55.520 --> 21:59.040
that's, or rug that's gonna have Mario Brothers stuff on it.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.440
Really there is no Mario Brothers furniture out there.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.320
But you would think, you know, with the popularity of Mario Brothers that there would be a ton

22:05.320 --> 22:06.320
of stuff out there.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.320
But it's not.

22:07.320 --> 22:12.200
There's a lot of handmade stuff on eBay that's just super expensive and really ugly.

22:12.200 --> 22:17.920
But um, yeah, a lot of it's just gonna be handmade and, uh, will be really awesome.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.640
Of course there'll be tons of pictures for it once it does get finished.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.200
Um, the other thing I'm working on right now, and this is just kind of an on a whim thing,

22:26.200 --> 22:32.480
uh, that I decided to do the other day is what, cause I love the, uh, phrasing project

22:32.480 --> 22:36.800
$10 that EA has been using, you know, cause they're charging people lots of money for

22:36.800 --> 22:38.960
stuff that should be in the games in the first place.

22:38.960 --> 22:46.920
Um, but I decided to come up with project under $100 and what project under $100 is,

22:46.920 --> 22:53.400
is building a working main cabinet under $100.

22:53.400 --> 22:56.440
And that's including everything, including shipping.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.800
Now, although I'm pricing stuff out now, I don't know if I can include shipping in there

22:59.800 --> 23:05.320
cause it's, I want to do a two player cocktail, but, um, it might be a little difficult.

23:05.320 --> 23:11.240
But basically though, um, you know, involving, uh, actually getting like an LCD monitor,

23:11.240 --> 23:16.120
computer, uh, all the arcade parts and that kind of stuff under $100.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.600
It might end up being $120.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.600
We'll see.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.440
Uh, after all that stuff, cause like I said, I don't want the extra buttons and joystick

23:21.440 --> 23:22.440
and stuff.

23:22.440 --> 23:26.360
Uh, so far I have the computer and the monitor for under $70.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.000
So I'm off to a good start.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.120
And um, the cabinet itself will be funny because it will be made out of cardboard.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.120
Nice.

23:35.120 --> 23:39.080
Thanks to the US postal service because you can get a ton of boxes from them for absolutely

23:39.080 --> 23:40.920
free and they ship them to you.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.920
Wow.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.400
That's kind of cool.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
Very cool.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.700
Uh, comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

23:46.700 --> 23:50.140

23:58.500 --> 24:03.140
Some comments from chat, ssj100matt, uh, talking about the baby room says diapers go in the

24:03.140 --> 24:05.660
chomp chomp bin.

24:05.660 --> 24:06.660
Get it?

24:06.660 --> 24:07.660
Cause yeah.

24:07.660 --> 24:08.660
Yeah.

24:08.660 --> 24:09.660
Yeah.

24:09.660 --> 24:10.660
All right.

24:10.660 --> 24:11.720
Uh, Derek H says, uh, if he does that, I'm assuming talking about the main cabinet, I'm

24:11.720 --> 24:12.720
doing it.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.840
My main cabinet is an old laptop, a monitor and an Xbox 360 controller.

24:15.840 --> 24:16.840
Yeah.

24:16.840 --> 24:17.840
Great.

24:17.840 --> 24:18.840
I mean, I could have done a lot of stuff.

24:18.840 --> 24:19.840
Hey, I've got some spare parts.

24:19.840 --> 24:24.560
I know this doesn't cost me anything, but I wanted it so that it can be somewhat reproducible

24:24.560 --> 24:28.720
because the problem is though, like shopping on eBay and buying new stuff, you never know

24:28.720 --> 24:32.320
what you're going to get for what price and I mean, you know, ideally you get one day

24:32.320 --> 24:33.320
is not a deal.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.400
You're gonna get another day.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.560
So I got lucky with some of that stuff.

24:36.560 --> 24:41.860
Like I said, I got a monitor for $32 an LCD monitor, 15 inch LCD monitor that has one

24:41.860 --> 24:43.500
dead pixel, but I don't give a shit.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.440
It's you know, going in a cardboard cabinets, who cares?

24:46.440 --> 24:54.400
Um, and I got a computer for $35 that's basically, uh, it's a 1.6 gigahertz processor, which

24:54.400 --> 24:59.480
is fine for MAME and I think a half gig of Ram, which is perfect for MAME.

24:59.480 --> 25:03.240
It's not going to be able to run anything really great, but it's just for MAME.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.560
That's all it really is going to be used for.

25:05.560 --> 25:11.660
Um, and then the cabinet itself, I'm kind of wondering, cause I'm not sure if I can

25:11.660 --> 25:18.800
do all of those boxes from the US Postal Service, uh, because they're only about a foot high

25:18.800 --> 25:22.560
and if I want like a cocktail cabinet, it's gotta be a few feet tall.

25:22.560 --> 25:26.640
So I may have to supplement it with some other stuff, but, um, I'm just kind of throwing

25:26.640 --> 25:27.640
around the idea.

25:27.640 --> 25:34.640
We got like this gift card from work for ironically enough selling split second and, um, so I'm

25:34.640 --> 25:36.100
using it for that.

25:36.100 --> 25:40.480
I bet Bobby would be proud to know that you got rewarded for selling extra copies of split

25:40.480 --> 25:42.440
second to people.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.440
Good job, Loki.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.000
It's a, it's a decent game.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.560
I mean, you know, I don't know.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
All right.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
Uh, anything else?

25:49.560 --> 25:50.560
Loki.

25:50.560 --> 25:51.560
That's it.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.560
All right.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.560
Let me get into, uh, my gaming week.

25:53.560 --> 25:54.560
Cause I, it was pretty busy.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.560
You know, we haven't been live the past two weeks.

25:55.560 --> 26:00.080
This is our first show live in, I guess what, three weeks then because we had two shows

26:00.080 --> 26:01.080
off.

26:01.080 --> 26:05.720
We had the show not planned to be off where my car broke down and I wasn't here in time,

26:05.720 --> 26:07.400
but we did have the podcast feed.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.560
So if you haven't heard episode three 68, we taped it later in the week, like a few

26:10.560 --> 26:11.780
days later, it went to the podcast feed.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.720
We couldn't do a live cause there's other all game shows on during the week, but we,

26:14.720 --> 26:16.400
we taped something and put it to the feet.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.680
Uh, and the Memorial day, we'd always plan to take off.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.800
Well, Memorial day, the reason why we were off, some of us are going on vacation.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.120
Uh, Alan and I went up to Portland and had a really good time, but what I wanted to share

26:26.120 --> 26:29.720
with you guys was this awesome place we found in downtown Portland.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.720
We had no idea this was there.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.100
I wasn't even looking for it.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.100
Just came across it.

26:33.100 --> 26:37.640
I saw a giant sign with the space invaders on it that said barcade.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.720
And I'm like, no way.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.000
It's like a bar in an arcade.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.880
And one of our friends that was with us was like, yeah, they have like old games there

26:42.880 --> 26:45.960
and you and I'm like, okay, we're going, we're going, let's go.

26:45.960 --> 26:49.080
It's classic arcade games and beer.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.360
And that's exactly what this place is.

26:50.360 --> 26:55.760
This place called ground control with a K. And I guess actually one thing I didn't realize

26:55.760 --> 27:00.400
it's one of those arcades that's also participating in the save the arcades to campaign.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.040
Uh, we had a story on that a couple of weeks ago because arcade infinity is also competing

27:04.040 --> 27:05.040
with this place.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.480
Well, I got to tell you, this place was awesome.

27:07.480 --> 27:12.560
I had a good time and, uh, you know, I, I didn't try to talk to anybody or I wasn't

27:12.560 --> 27:16.320
like, you know, I'm from Warren's Laundry, you know, I just, I went in as a, as a patron

27:16.320 --> 27:19.660
and I had a really good time just playing some of the classic games and that's really

27:19.660 --> 27:20.660
what this place was.

27:20.660 --> 27:22.740
It was full of classic games.

27:22.740 --> 27:24.120
I played burger time.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.520
I played Qbert.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.080
I played, uh, Marvel versus Capcom.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.640
I played pinball, like the upstairs was just pinball, pinball, and more pinball.

27:32.640 --> 27:36.920
I was like, I think I had to, I sent a message to Jamie on Twitter or a text or something.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.160
I was like, Jamie, you have to come here like right now.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.360
Here's pinball everywhere.

27:41.360 --> 27:45.800
I played theater of magic, which is one of my favorite tables they ever did.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.240
And uh, Arabian nights, which is awesome.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.240
That's the one with the giant genie lamp in the middle that spins around when you hit

27:51.240 --> 27:52.240
it.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.240
Awesome.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.520
I don't remember seeing it.

27:54.520 --> 27:55.520
They had a lot.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.040
They had more pinball machines than I've ever seen in an arcade at a lot.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.160
But there were like, somebody asked me if they had space jam.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.160
I didn't see space jam.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.160
I did see Dr. Who.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.600
That made me think of you.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.440
They had a Dr. Who table, so that was pretty cool.

28:07.440 --> 28:11.380
The only complaint I have about the place is that the game, the games are packed in

28:11.380 --> 28:14.920
so tight because the real estate there, there's not a lot of it.

28:14.920 --> 28:18.880
There's a lot of like brushing up against strangers and not a lot of elbow room.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.960
I got to say, I was there on a, was I there Friday or Saturday?

28:21.960 --> 28:22.960
No, we drove in Friday.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.360
So it was there Saturday night.

28:24.360 --> 28:26.080
It was pretty hopping.

28:26.080 --> 28:30.560
Like you would think this is kind of a niche thing, but just add booze, you guys.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.480
They have beers on tap and they were, they were a hopping place.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.480
There were quite a few people in there.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.480
Yeah.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.520
I mean, it's, it's kind of like Dave and Buster's for those of us that are into classic games.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.880
So I endorse this place.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.160
If you're in the Pacific Northwest, you need to check this place out.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.160
It's ground control.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.160
It's a lot of fun.

28:45.160 --> 28:48.520
Um, they do all sorts of theme nights, uh, apparently throughout the month too.

28:48.520 --> 28:51.240
And they have bands that, that perform there and everything.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.540
So I, yeah, I had a good time.

28:53.540 --> 28:54.540
So I'm surprised.

28:54.540 --> 28:59.200
And one thing, and Alan said the same thing, and I commented on this too, is that why in

28:59.200 --> 29:01.040
the hell don't they have this in San Francisco?

29:01.040 --> 29:03.800
Like there's nothing like it in San Francisco.

29:03.800 --> 29:08.360
And you would think of all places, kind of tech central, you know, NorCal would have

29:08.360 --> 29:10.200
something like it, but sadly it does not.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.920
Uh, SJ100Matt says that there is a barcade in New York City, Brooklyn to be exact.

29:13.920 --> 29:18.040
You know, I think I'd heard about that, uh, but I had not been there.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.520
Um, Bond006 in chat says, did you have a geek moment?

29:21.520 --> 29:24.560
Yes, I did have a geek moment when I went in there and squeed.

29:24.560 --> 29:28.240
And I watched my friend, get this guys, I know a long time OLR fans will appreciate

29:28.240 --> 29:32.960
this, they had a DDR Extreme machine that I watched my friend play for only 50 cents.

29:32.960 --> 29:33.960
Good times.

29:33.960 --> 29:34.960
And no tokens.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.600
They, that was another refreshing theme.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.200
Everything actually ran on quarters and they had to have signs on the machines that say

29:40.200 --> 29:42.580
don't use this for your laundry, buddy.

29:42.580 --> 29:43.740
That's old school.

29:43.740 --> 29:44.740
Good times.

29:44.740 --> 29:49.760
So yes, uh, A++ for ground control and I hope there's more places that spring up like it.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.640
Um, as far as other games that I've played that you don't have to be in Portland in order

29:53.640 --> 29:58.320
to, um, access, I did play a couple of new games since I was in Oregon.

29:58.320 --> 30:02.540
Oregon is infamous for not having sales tax, at least to those of us in California.

30:02.540 --> 30:03.840
So I loaded up on games.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.320
I bought four new games this week.

30:05.320 --> 30:09.360
I bought Blur, Split Second, Red Dead Redemption and Alan Wake.

30:09.360 --> 30:13.560
I bought all of those games so that I could save a little bit on sales tax cause I'm cheap.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.440
Although I bought four new video games.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.440
It wasn't that cheap.

30:16.440 --> 30:20.240
Uh, I played two of them this week cause I didn't have time to do everything and I was

30:20.240 --> 30:21.240
kind of focusing.

30:21.240 --> 30:24.680
I probably played Blur more than any other game that I got this week.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.120
Um, and Blur is pretty cool.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.380
It is exactly what they are marketing it as in the commercials.

30:30.380 --> 30:32.800
It is Mario Kart meets Burnout.

30:32.800 --> 30:38.000
It is, you know, Mario Kart for grownups, um, but it's, you know, obviously there's

30:38.000 --> 30:40.120
something to be said about the cute factor of Mario Kart.

30:40.120 --> 30:43.720
I don't think that Mario Kart is simply just a kid's game, but if you ever thought, gee,

30:43.720 --> 30:47.720
I'd like to play like old school Burnout, but with powerups, that is exactly why they

30:47.720 --> 30:48.720
made Blur.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.540
That's, that's the simplest way I could describe it.

30:50.540 --> 30:51.800
It's Burnout with powerups.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.240
Um, and it's a lot of fun.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.880
I think online especially has done very well.

30:55.880 --> 31:00.600
Um, I, I, it's very easy to find a game, join it, you get to vote on the track you want

31:00.600 --> 31:01.600
to do.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.880
It's kind of very easy to just get in there and play and have some fun online.

31:04.880 --> 31:09.160
There are noob only rooms that are restricted to those that are level 10 and under and I

31:09.160 --> 31:12.240
thought that was good so that you can play with people that are new to the game.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.960
I was actually able to win a game because of that, which shocked the hell out of me

31:15.960 --> 31:19.200
because I never win games on Xbox Live because you're always against some expert.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.200
Um, so I, I, I had a lot of fun with Blur.

31:22.200 --> 31:26.840
I do have some complaints about the game or things they could do better in the sequel

31:26.840 --> 31:30.000
because I, I, I'm, I'm pretty sure there will be a Blur 2.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.820
There deserves to be a Blur 2, um, and, uh, there are some things I would like to see

31:33.820 --> 31:35.440
them do better in the sequel.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.120
First off, my number one complaint about the game.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.360
The soundtrack blows.

31:39.360 --> 31:44.920
Um, it's non-existent in some parts and I don't really know like what the music score

31:44.920 --> 31:45.920
is.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.760
In some parts, like there's a movie in the beginning that kind of had a cool song I recognized

31:50.760 --> 31:56.120
in it that was neat and, and in the opening menus, there's some cool techno songs, but

31:56.120 --> 32:02.920
you would think something with that look of Blur, like the neon, the kind of like F-Zero

32:02.920 --> 32:07.680
but not in the future look that Blur sort of has the burnout meets F-Zero look, uh,

32:07.680 --> 32:11.320
you would think has some type of like techno thumping soundtrack to it, right?

32:11.320 --> 32:12.960
Or something like that's what burnout had.

32:12.960 --> 32:17.440
The burnout tracks, EA tracks, I mean, granted Blur is by Activision, but you would still

32:17.440 --> 32:20.600
expect there to be somewhat of a soundtrack, but it, it wasn't there.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.360
It wasn't notable for me.

32:22.360 --> 32:25.320
And from what I understand, you know, they had this agreement apparently signed where

32:25.320 --> 32:27.660
I guess Crystal Method produced a soundtrack.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.480
I was just expecting something a lot more.

32:30.480 --> 32:35.240
Um, I was tempted just to really use custom soundtracks the whole time.

32:35.240 --> 32:39.160
I was very disappointed in, in what should have been a better soundtrack.

32:39.160 --> 32:44.600
My other complaint is, believe it or not, the graphics are not awesome.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.040
You know, like they're, they're good.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.720
They're definitely next gen.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.040
They're a step above what you're going to see on the Wii.

32:50.040 --> 32:56.000
But I wasn't like blown away by the graphics, like, yeah, Blur has this neon thing going

32:56.000 --> 33:02.480
for it, but that neon is often mixed in many stages with Highway 50 going through Nevada,

33:02.480 --> 33:08.160
like that very brown, blonde, dusty kind of theme, which I don't know what they were trying

33:08.160 --> 33:11.920
to go for with it, but it, it didn't make the graphics look that notable.

33:11.920 --> 33:17.760
Honestly, the graphics were kind of comparable to Fuel, which didn't really have A++ graphics

33:17.760 --> 33:18.760
either.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.760
So I was a little bit disappointed.

33:20.760 --> 33:25.960
But in the end, graphics and sound are not the only important things in a video game,

33:25.960 --> 33:30.800
and the game itself is still a lot of fun, and I am having fun making my way through

33:30.800 --> 33:31.800
it.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.920
I am deserving of a sequel.

33:32.920 --> 33:35.880
I hope they just put a little more polish on it next time.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.040
That is what I would hope for.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.880
Comments from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

33:42.880 --> 33:48.480
Bond006 says, has anyone seen the underhand slap at Ninty, Nintendo, in the Blur ad at

33:48.480 --> 33:49.480
the end?

33:49.480 --> 33:52.280
Oh yeah, I think the Blur ad is great, and it's really perfect for what Blur is trying

33:52.280 --> 33:53.280
to be.

33:53.280 --> 33:54.280
Awesome.

33:54.280 --> 33:56.980
Deathwishing says, the graphics are better than Fuel.

33:56.980 --> 33:59.880
Trust me, I loved Fuel.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.880
I liked Fuel a lot too.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.640
I thought Fuel was severely underrated.

34:03.640 --> 34:08.400
But Fuel was also, the biggest problem with Fuel is that it was too ambitious, and there

34:08.400 --> 34:13.240
wasn't enough polish because the world was too big in Fuel.

34:13.240 --> 34:14.760
That was its biggest problem.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.840
Its ambition was its own worst enemy.

34:16.840 --> 34:20.500
And to some extent, maybe that was the biggest problem with Blur is that they spent so much

34:20.500 --> 34:25.320
time on the game itself, which is where you should spend the time, don't get me wrong.

34:25.320 --> 34:29.300
I think some of the graphics and sound I think suffered a little bit.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.600
But let me say this too, because this is important.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.800
One feature that's in Blur that I think a lot of people overlook, that does make it

34:34.800 --> 34:41.760
pretty awesome, and may explain why the graphics take a hit, it does have split screen multiplayer.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.220
So you don't just have to play this game on Xbox Live.

34:45.220 --> 34:49.200
You can play, like Mario Kart, two people on one screen.

34:49.200 --> 34:51.520
So that's kind of cool.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.040
So, you know, take it with a grain of salt, I suppose.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.160
Maybe that's why they had to make some concessions with the graphics and sound.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.560
The other game I played this week, Red Dead Redemption, which might surprise some of you

35:02.560 --> 35:03.560
guys who listen to this show.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.720
It's not usually the type of game I would play, but the reviews on it have been so stellar,

35:07.720 --> 35:10.640
and I've read such good things on it, I'm like, I have to pick this up and know what

35:10.640 --> 35:11.640
I'm missing.

35:11.640 --> 35:16.480
I'm gonna be honest, I haven't played a whole lot of this story, because I can't stop shooting

35:16.480 --> 35:17.940
random people.

35:17.940 --> 35:22.240
That's right, the minute they gave me a gun, I just walk up to random townspeople and shoot

35:22.240 --> 35:23.240
them.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.840
And I'm trying to find out all the different ways to kill them.

35:24.840 --> 35:28.560
Like, you can shoot them in the face, or run up to them and shoot them in the stomach,

35:28.560 --> 35:30.480
and I laugh maniacally every time to the point...

35:30.480 --> 35:32.640
You need to get the lasso.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.560
That's what I'm hearing, everybody tells me that.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.520
Once you get the lasso...

35:36.520 --> 35:39.200
Dan just said the same damn thing when I walked in there.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.200
It's just...

35:40.200 --> 35:43.480
Okay, my sister came over, she's been playing Red Dead Redemption as well, because I got

35:43.480 --> 35:49.840
her a copy, and she just comes over and just can't stop laughing at what she's been doing.

35:49.840 --> 35:55.080
She says one of the things she likes doing is lassoing a coyote and dragging it into

35:55.080 --> 36:01.280
the middle of town, and then letting it go, because it will attack whatever it sees.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.280
That's pretty funny.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.800
And then you can tie people up, throw them on the train tracks, you can tie people up

36:05.800 --> 36:08.760
and push them off a hill.

36:08.760 --> 36:13.600
My favorite is calling my horse over while I'm standing next to a cliff and it just dives

36:13.600 --> 36:16.680
off the cliff, because it's just stupid.

36:16.680 --> 36:20.240
Honestly, here it is with Red Dead Redemption.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.080
It's sandbox gaming at its finest.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.080
It really is.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.800
If you've ever wanted one of that Wild West sandbox...

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
Grand Theft Horse.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.800
There you go.

36:27.800 --> 36:28.800
Grand Theft...

36:28.800 --> 36:29.800
Well, it is.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.800
It's the same engine.

36:30.800 --> 36:31.800
It's that rock star engine...

36:31.800 --> 36:32.800
Rage.

36:32.800 --> 36:33.800
Yeah, Rage.

36:33.800 --> 36:34.800
They're proprietary engines.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.800
And they're euphoria.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.840
Tigerclaw says, wow, sky is sadistic, very uncharacteristic of you.

36:38.840 --> 36:39.840
Dude, I just...

36:39.840 --> 36:43.240
I don't play these games an awful lot, but when I do, it's really funny.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.120
I don't take it seriously.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.740
You guys know how...

36:46.740 --> 36:49.680
I know a lot of you guys must be kind of like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.960
Isn't Rob the same guy who went off on the Saw movies and now he doesn't like them because

36:52.960 --> 36:53.960
they're too violent?

36:53.960 --> 36:58.860
Well, yeah, but Saw is kind of like realistic and like Red Dead Redemption, like the graphics

36:58.860 --> 37:01.900
are good and all, but it's not realistic.

37:01.900 --> 37:02.960
You know what I mean?

37:02.960 --> 37:03.960
There's a difference.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.960
There's a huge difference.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.280
I can't explain it.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.680
If it makes me a hypocrite, well, screw you.

37:09.680 --> 37:14.360
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what would your mother say about this?

37:14.360 --> 37:16.880
Rob, that's just gross, Rob.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.240
My mom said we could call her by the way.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.240
Really?

37:19.240 --> 37:20.240
We're going to have to do that.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.240
I don't know if we should do it tonight.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.240
I'm going to say next week.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.240
We should.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.240
Yeah.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.240
And if you...

37:25.240 --> 37:26.240
Let's do it after E3 because I think the next two... because next week is the Microsoft

37:26.240 --> 37:31.680
thing, but definitely in the near future, we will make that work.

37:31.680 --> 37:36.080
Kitsune says, Red Dead Redemption feels so much more fun than Grand Theft Auto IV though.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.980
You know, I kind of agree.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.640
I don't know what it is, Kitsune.

37:39.640 --> 37:40.960
I feel the same thing.

37:40.960 --> 37:46.760
There's something about it where I don't know if it's just the environment or it's just

37:46.760 --> 37:52.280
the story or I just get drawn into Red Dead Redemption a lot more and I do Grand Theft

37:52.280 --> 37:53.280
Auto IV.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.280
I don't know.

37:54.280 --> 37:59.040
Deathwishing in chat says, Rob, I got mauled by 13 cougars at once.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.040
That's awesome.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.480
I was instantly thinking of...

38:01.480 --> 38:04.180
I was instantly thinking of Courtney Cox in Cougar Town.

38:04.180 --> 38:05.180
Is it just me?

38:05.180 --> 38:06.180
Is it just me?

38:06.180 --> 38:08.440
I was thinking of Blanche because you know she...

38:08.440 --> 38:09.440
Blanche.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.440
Ah, rest in peace, Blanche.

38:10.440 --> 38:11.440
I know.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.440
I know.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.440
I miss those old broads.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.440
All right.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.640
But Betty White has outlasted them all.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.640
That's right.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.640
There can be only one.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.080
And Betty White has proved she's the HBIC.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.080
That's right.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.080
Okay.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.480
That's pretty much it for my gaming week.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.160
We're literally 40 minutes into the show.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.680
Haven't touched a damn bit of news.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.720
So let me do some quick housekeeping, guys.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.280
There's some new articles at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

38:32.280 --> 38:37.160
There's been some great, great retro reviews, retro rear views written in the past couple

38:37.160 --> 38:38.160
of weeks.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.520
It's been done by baseballs, got some gameplay.

38:40.520 --> 38:41.840
There's a story on Metal Gear.

38:41.840 --> 38:47.000
A new segment that's being done by ActDeft called Video Stumble, which is kind of neat.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
So check that out, guys.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.760
Our website is expanding with all this kind of retro-ish content, and I thought that was

38:51.760 --> 38:52.760
really cool.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.320
I also uploaded some pics from my Portland trip.

38:54.320 --> 38:58.600
If you want to see the picture of the Burger Time machine and the OLR initials, I put those

38:58.600 --> 39:01.400
up at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, so check those out.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.400
I also want to give a plug.

39:02.400 --> 39:09.200
Maybe I'll let Jamie plug this, but she wrote a great article on our friend website.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.560
I don't want to say our sister website, but our BFF website.

39:12.560 --> 39:13.560
We'll say that.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.200
Our BFF at Geek-Life.com.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.600
Tell them a little bit about what you did, DarkSucker.

39:18.600 --> 39:24.560
Well, actually, I have a regular panel on there every week on Tuesday that's called

39:24.560 --> 39:32.520
Geek Cube, talking about how to incorporate your geeky life with your work life.

39:32.520 --> 39:36.760
But I also write other articles, like I did a review of this place called Fairy Tale Town

39:36.760 --> 39:38.480
for little kids.

39:38.480 --> 39:46.320
But I also did a write-up for OrangeLoungeRadio, since we get a nice big plug on the website.

39:46.320 --> 39:54.160
So I just basically kind of did the not-so-secret origin of OrangeLoungeRadio.

39:54.160 --> 39:59.120
Well, it was a historical type of thing, and kind of went through how we evolved from the

39:59.120 --> 40:03.240
show that was on the living room floor about DDR and 2DX to the show we are today.

40:03.240 --> 40:04.240
It was pretty cool.

40:04.240 --> 40:09.240
I mean, and really, it's the question, you know, we get asked it fairly often, like,

40:09.240 --> 40:13.480
how'd you come up with that name, and how'd you come up with this, and how long you been

40:13.480 --> 40:15.840
doing this, and what was it like, and blah, blah, blah.

40:15.840 --> 40:20.240
And there's a few of you who've been here since, you know, episode one, which I think

40:20.240 --> 40:24.680
are all in this room, and two people in chat.

40:24.680 --> 40:33.440
So but, you know, I really just wanted to go through and sort of give, you know, a little

40:33.440 --> 40:38.280
origin story, you know, how we evolved, how we've gotten to where we are now.

40:38.280 --> 40:42.800
By the way, I hear DarkSakura might not be the only OLR host writing something for Geek

40:42.800 --> 40:43.800
Life.

40:43.800 --> 40:44.800
Wahaha.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.800
Uh-huh.

40:45.800 --> 40:46.800
Uh-huh.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.800
I'll give you a hint.

40:47.800 --> 40:48.800
It's not me.

40:48.800 --> 40:56.400
Well, just to go ahead and do the call-out, we are looking for people to contribute content.

40:56.400 --> 41:02.080
Just basically go to geek-life.com, and we have a little link on there for submissions

41:02.080 --> 41:04.800
so you can submit to our will.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.240
Although I really need to be writing stuff for orangelawnsradio.com, too.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.240
Yes, I do.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.240
And we don't want to sadly neglect that.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.240
Well, we can, we can.

41:10.240 --> 41:14.360
But we've got great fan staff that's been doing a good job, so props to all of those

41:14.360 --> 41:15.360
kids.

41:15.360 --> 41:23.080
But yeah, keep a look out because, you know, and also you may see a few things cross-posted.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.080
Very cool.

41:24.080 --> 41:27.680
I'm actually going to have an interview up on the site next week, next week I hope.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.680
Interview, interview.

41:28.680 --> 41:34.480
With Jim McCann, who wrote New Avengers The Reunion and is writing the current Hawkeye

41:34.480 --> 41:40.920
Mockingbird and the Dazzler one-shot that was fabulous.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.920
Geek Life, indeed.

41:42.920 --> 41:47.120
Well, and that, that and he's just a really, really cool person, so.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.120
Sounds like fun.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.120
All right.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.120
Geek-life.com.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
The dash is important.

41:51.120 --> 41:52.760
What happens if they don't put the dash in?

41:52.760 --> 41:53.760
Do they get porn?

41:53.760 --> 41:54.760
Probably.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.760
All right.

41:55.760 --> 41:56.760
Let's see.

41:56.760 --> 41:57.760
Geek is porn?

41:57.760 --> 41:58.760
Could you imagine?

41:58.760 --> 41:59.760
Oh, it's probably is there.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.880
You know, actually, I don't know if you've noticed, but your ads on Geek Life, a lot

42:01.880 --> 42:03.200
of them are for geek dating sites.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.200
I don't know if you've noticed.

42:04.200 --> 42:05.200
Yeah.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.200
Yeah.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.200
There you go.

42:07.200 --> 42:12.320
So, and again, if you do click on ads, does, does, does it, does, does Maren get some kickback

42:12.320 --> 42:13.320
for the click, ad clicking?

42:13.320 --> 42:16.200
I think it's, yeah, I think it helps cover the site.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.200
Just goes to pay for the site.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.040
So, click on ads and have a good time.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.040
All right.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.160
Hey, I want to mention this too, because I got asked about this earlier tonight.

42:22.160 --> 42:26.360
I don't have a lot to say on this yet, but we were asked, apparently All Games Radio

42:26.360 --> 42:29.040
is putting together this thing called The Big Battle.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.920
And I was asked if we are participating.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.320
I literally found out about this today.

42:34.320 --> 42:39.380
But from what I understand in a nutshell, it is a bunch of the shows at All Games Radio

42:39.380 --> 42:40.380
kind of getting together.

42:40.380 --> 42:43.400
And it's kind of one of those things that when you hear the idea, you're kind of like,

42:43.400 --> 42:45.080
this should have been done like two years ago.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.360
Like, how obvious is this?

42:46.360 --> 42:48.760
And why haven't we done something like this a while ago?

42:48.760 --> 42:51.160
But our props, I don't know who is spearheading this.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.720
I think it might be Dead Pixel Live.

42:52.720 --> 42:53.720
I don't know.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.260
But props to them for putting it on.

42:56.260 --> 43:02.040
It's going to kind of bring the All Games community together in big battles on games.

43:02.040 --> 43:06.320
I can't 100% for sure confirm our participation yet, because I have to talk to Dark Soccer

43:06.320 --> 43:07.320
on Loki after the show.

43:07.320 --> 43:08.520
See what we can do.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.640
But why wouldn't we?

43:10.640 --> 43:11.640
I mean, really.

43:11.640 --> 43:14.920
I mean, I'm all about like trying to promote the All Games Network and other shows.

43:14.920 --> 43:21.040
And I think a lot of our greatest listeners has come from the cross kind of pollination

43:21.040 --> 43:22.160
of the shows.

43:22.160 --> 43:27.080
And I've always said, I realize Orange Lounge Radio is not for everybody.

43:27.080 --> 43:29.560
There's some games we just don't really talk about here on the show.

43:29.560 --> 43:30.560
Like Madden.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.720
Actually, we have a Madden story tonight, funny enough.

43:32.720 --> 43:35.320
Usually, we don't talk a lot about the sports games like Madden.

43:35.320 --> 43:36.720
But there's other shows on the network.

43:36.720 --> 43:39.160
They talk about that a lot.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.080
And they probably would go, DDR?

43:41.080 --> 43:43.240
What are those guys doing?

43:43.240 --> 43:48.080
So if you don't like us, surely there's another show on the network that caters to your interest.

43:48.080 --> 43:49.600
So I'm definitely all about that.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.400
So sure, I'm sure we're going to participate.

43:51.400 --> 43:55.280
It's just a matter of figuring out what games we will actually be able to play.

43:55.280 --> 44:00.060
However, as I understand it, this is not just a host versus host thing.

44:00.060 --> 44:03.520
This is a listener versus listener thing.

44:03.520 --> 44:10.840
So we're going to need you, OL Army, to sign up and represent us in some of these games.

44:10.840 --> 44:14.560
So I will hopefully have more details for you on that next week.

44:14.560 --> 44:19.440
Again, I'm not confirming our participation, but I'm just saying, it's probably going to

44:19.440 --> 44:20.440
happen.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.440
All right.

44:21.440 --> 44:24.240
Anyhow, hopefully I didn't say too much on that.

44:24.240 --> 44:27.560
But somebody asked in chat earlier, and I think the All Games folks know what's going

44:27.560 --> 44:28.560
on, so whatevs.

44:28.560 --> 44:31.000
Also, the other thing I want to plug.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.680
E3 is coming up next week.

44:33.680 --> 44:37.280
Believe it or not, E3 is kind of starting on a Sunday this year.

44:37.280 --> 44:38.280
I mean, not officially.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.240
The show itself does not start on a Tuesday.

44:40.240 --> 44:45.520
But while our show is going on, did you guys know, at I think about 8 o'clock Pacific,

44:45.520 --> 44:51.920
I could have the time wrong, but that is Xbox, Microsoft's Project Natal Cirque du Soleil

44:51.920 --> 44:54.280
show is a week from right now.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.000
So we're actually going to be here.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.520
We will be doing a show.

44:57.520 --> 45:01.800
We may cut live to the press conference if we can get some coverage.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.720
We will figure out how we can do that.

45:03.720 --> 45:06.320
I don't know if it's going to be much besides a show.

45:06.320 --> 45:10.000
I don't know what's all involved with that, but we will try to figure that out and bring

45:10.000 --> 45:11.780
you that live next week.

45:11.780 --> 45:17.320
Also here live next week, speaking of old school OLR, an old familiar guest of the show,

45:17.320 --> 45:20.360
Miklotov, is going to be here because he's going to E3 with me.

45:20.360 --> 45:23.640
So we don't leave till Monday night, so we will be here Sunday.

45:23.640 --> 45:26.400
We are not going to miss any OLR because of E3.

45:26.400 --> 45:30.120
In fact, there might be bonus OLR on the feed.

45:30.120 --> 45:36.880
I wouldn't see why myself and Miklotov and maybe Loki and DarkSakura via phone, depending

45:36.880 --> 45:42.160
on what we can do, or at least Bobby BlackWolf, I'm sure, if he's not too busy with all his

45:42.160 --> 45:46.260
appointments, will do some little mini podcast that will go to the feed during E3.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.260
So that'll be fun.

45:47.260 --> 45:52.200
Loki, I know you'll be hitting refresh on the sites nonstop, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.480
Now here's what I'm going to be doing during the week.

45:54.480 --> 45:58.760
And this is sad because I'm not very productive during E3.

45:58.760 --> 46:04.040
I watch the live conferences at my desk.

46:04.040 --> 46:05.040
Good times.

46:05.040 --> 46:08.920
Or, yeah, I refresh on like four different live feeds at once.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.800
I'd like to be able to stream it on my iPhone.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.960
I might be able to.

46:14.960 --> 46:19.000
Our internet's that crappy at work, so why not?

46:19.000 --> 46:21.480
All right, lots of housekeeping.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.080
Now we can finally get to gaming news.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.080
Hey, hey, hey.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.080
Gaming news.

46:26.080 --> 46:27.080
Oh, yeah, on Facebook.

46:27.080 --> 46:28.080
Facebook.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.080
Add us on Facebook.

46:29.080 --> 46:30.080
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.560
Twitter.com slash OLR.

46:31.560 --> 46:32.560
Have I named everything?

46:32.560 --> 46:33.800
I think I have.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.720
Let's get into the freaking show already.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.680
Loki, what is going on in gaming news?

46:38.680 --> 46:43.320
You know, I guess I could take time off during E3, too, because I do have a lot of time off.

46:43.320 --> 46:45.640
You should have just gone to the, well, you got your wife and the baby.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.360
She would not let me go to E3.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.280
She's having nightmares about me going to E3.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.280
I know, I know.

46:50.280 --> 46:53.720
Not nightmares, but dreams of which she is mad at me afterwards.

46:53.720 --> 46:54.720
I know.

46:54.720 --> 46:55.720
Oh, well.

46:55.720 --> 46:56.720
Maybe next year.

46:56.720 --> 46:57.720
Yeah, next.

46:57.720 --> 46:58.720
Well.

46:58.720 --> 46:59.720
Maybe not.

46:59.720 --> 47:00.720
Maybe in three years.

47:00.720 --> 47:01.720
Never.

47:01.720 --> 47:02.720
Yeah.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.600
So anyways, there's a rumor going around that Harmonics is working on a dancing game for

47:06.600 --> 47:08.240
Natal.

47:08.240 --> 47:15.800
And this is becoming, I guess, obvious due to some licenses that they are acquiring for

47:15.800 --> 47:22.280
different danceable tracks, including Cascada's Evacuate the Dance Floor, Timberland's The

47:22.280 --> 47:23.280
Way I Are.

47:23.280 --> 47:24.280
Wait a minute.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.560
This came up a couple weeks ago, I think, some of these licensing things.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.760
So now we've got clarity to what's being used for?

47:28.760 --> 47:32.880
Well, they're just guessing, I think, based on the fact that it's danceable music.

47:32.880 --> 47:34.080
I'm hoping for a DJ game.

47:34.080 --> 47:37.120
I remember that Timberland thing coming up before.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.760
So I think some of this is just, but I don't remember Cascada.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.640
I would remember something like that.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.640
Interesting.

47:42.640 --> 47:43.640
Yeah.

47:43.640 --> 47:51.800
And they're, you know, not really saying, this is coming also from Game Informer, the

47:51.800 --> 47:55.360
rumor that they're saying they're working on a dancing game.

47:55.360 --> 48:00.320
You know what, it makes sense if you think about it, because what game, you know, last

48:00.320 --> 48:05.880
fall was just incredibly popular, in fact, I think it's still popular now, that I would've

48:05.880 --> 48:11.120
never pegged to be at the top of some of these selling lists, and that would be Just Dance

48:11.120 --> 48:16.600
from Ubisoft, which is basically a game where you dance around to cues on the screen.

48:16.600 --> 48:22.000
And it makes sense that you would use this for, like, Natal or something.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
I don't know.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.600
I mean, it's not a big surprise to me, and I'm sure with Natal, and probably the same

48:26.600 --> 48:33.040
with the move, you're gonna see lots of these really gimmicky things that the Wii has had

48:33.040 --> 48:34.040
forever.

48:34.040 --> 48:38.400
Yeah, but, I mean, Loki, to be fair, that gimmicky game is kind of the roots of our

48:38.400 --> 48:39.400
show.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.720
I mean, DDR was a bit of a gimmicky game.

48:40.720 --> 48:45.680
I understand that, but there's a difference between, you know, following cues on screen,

48:45.680 --> 48:48.680
like, you know, arrows going down the screen, and you actually have to hit them in time

48:48.680 --> 48:53.280
with the beat, versus, I'm watching a person dance on screen, and I'm trying to emulate

48:53.280 --> 48:54.280
what they're doing on screen.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.600
I can watch MTV and do that, okay?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.000
I don't have to pay for a game.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.520
I get that, Loki, but here's the place where I have a little more hope than I do with all

49:02.520 --> 49:07.200
the rest of that, is the fact that Harmonix is rumored to be tied into this.

49:07.200 --> 49:11.240
Harmonix, I'm trying to think here, have they ever made a bad music game?

49:11.240 --> 49:14.120
Just a straight up bad music game?

49:14.120 --> 49:15.760
I can't think of one.

49:15.760 --> 49:19.560
Maybe the chatters will jump in, but Harmonix makes pretty good games.

49:19.560 --> 49:20.560
Guitar Hero.

49:20.560 --> 49:26.400
Well, but, well, the first Guitar Hero was revolutionary, and so the second one was good

49:26.400 --> 49:28.560
too, and then they jumped ship and made Rock Band.

49:28.560 --> 49:32.000
They didn't have anything to do with the third thereafter, remember that?

49:32.000 --> 49:36.440
So, I mean, Harmonix, the fact that they're involved gives me a little more hope.

49:36.440 --> 49:40.600
I mean, if you think about it, Rock Band 3, I mean, how much more programming is Rock

49:40.600 --> 49:41.600
Band 3 gonna take?

49:41.600 --> 49:46.080
I mean, it's probably just the Beatles and Green Day Engine souped up a little more with

49:46.080 --> 49:49.960
the keyboard, whatever's put in, you know, a little more something-something there.

49:49.960 --> 49:52.600
There's probably something else being cooked up over there.

49:52.600 --> 49:56.220
This makes perfect sense that this would be it.

49:56.220 --> 49:59.480
And who's to say that it's not necessarily a game like DDR?

49:59.480 --> 50:05.840
I mean, if Natal is supposed to be this magic thing that knows where you are in the room,

50:05.840 --> 50:09.440
it could work just like DDR with no dance pad.

50:09.440 --> 50:13.480
That's gonna look weird if it works like...

50:13.480 --> 50:14.600
I don't know.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.600
I think it's just gonna be just like Just Dance.

50:17.600 --> 50:23.160
I mean, it's probably not gonna be any more elaborate than that.

50:23.160 --> 50:27.480
It'll just be interesting because you'll be able to do multiplayer and that kind of stuff,

50:27.480 --> 50:32.500
and it'll be more accurate because it's using a camera instead of just sensors in a close

50:32.500 --> 50:34.560
approximation of whatever you're doing.

50:34.560 --> 50:39.080
Maybe the joke is that these are actually tracks for Rock Band 3, because Rock Band

50:39.080 --> 50:42.840
3 will also be incorporating dancers.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.800
Or maybe they're working on a DJ game.

50:45.800 --> 50:46.800
Perhaps.

50:46.800 --> 50:47.800
Because they never said anything.

50:47.800 --> 50:51.200
They're just saying, oh, it's gonna be an Natal-based dance game.

50:51.200 --> 50:55.840
And I don't know if they're just guessing because, you know, Natal coming out soon,

50:55.840 --> 50:59.800
and the fact that those types of games have done well in the past, and also because these

50:59.800 --> 51:00.800
are danceable tracks.

51:00.800 --> 51:04.680
I mean, there's a lot of speculation going on, unless they know something that we don't.

51:04.680 --> 51:13.440
But being the expert analyst that I am, I'm sure it'll be something gimmicky.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.960
Miklotov is actually in our chat room tonight, and he says, Rock Band Unplugged sucked.

51:16.960 --> 51:20.200
Well, I mean, opinion is relative or whatever, but I actually disagree.

51:20.200 --> 51:23.360
I think Rock Band Unplugged, it wasn't Rock Band.

51:23.360 --> 51:28.880
It was frequency amplitude PSP with rock songs, but I didn't think it was bad at all.

51:28.880 --> 51:32.240
And actually, the really cool thing about that game, remember, it was totally free.

51:32.240 --> 51:34.840
The demo would work with the download songs, remember that?

51:34.840 --> 51:35.840
Yep.

51:35.840 --> 51:36.840
Good times.

51:36.840 --> 51:37.840
So.

51:37.840 --> 51:42.280
Blaze in our chat room says, maybe we'll finally get a Dance Mania-esque game.

51:42.280 --> 51:46.080
Well, I mean, if these are the licensed songs, though, Blaze, I don't know if you're really

51:46.080 --> 51:48.660
getting a Dance Mania-esque game.

51:48.660 --> 51:52.360
Or are you thinking of Dance Maniacs, because there's Dance Mania, the CDs that inspired

51:52.360 --> 51:53.360
the VR.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.360
I think he's thinking Dance Maniacs.

51:54.360 --> 51:55.360
Maybe he's thinking Dance Maniacs.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.060
I'm gonna be honest.

51:57.060 --> 51:58.060
I hope not.

51:58.060 --> 51:59.240
I mean, don't get me wrong.

51:59.240 --> 52:03.880
I like Dance Maniacs for what it was, but it's a little bit gimmicky, and I think it's

52:03.880 --> 52:04.880
a $60 game.

52:04.880 --> 52:05.880
The technology's old.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.040
I just don't see it.

52:08.040 --> 52:10.960
And the technology's old, and they're not gonna do anything like that anymore, because

52:10.960 --> 52:15.440
now you can do full dancing games, because they have all these fun sensors that they

52:15.440 --> 52:16.440
can use.

52:16.440 --> 52:20.120
Couldn't they do better things with a Dance Maniacs-style soundtrack?

52:20.120 --> 52:21.880
I think that's what we should be looking for.

52:21.880 --> 52:27.040
I think we, especially as music game fans, I mean, OLR's been on for, what, eight years,

52:27.040 --> 52:29.080
and DDR was started in 1998.

52:29.080 --> 52:33.160
I mean, we've really got to start looking forward, not trying to emulate what's happened

52:33.160 --> 52:34.160
in the past.

52:34.160 --> 52:35.160
I think they-

52:35.160 --> 52:37.640
And this is where Konami is failing miserably, by the way.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.440
What happened to DDR out of Konami?

52:39.440 --> 52:42.320
I mean, I don't want to spoil a story that's coming up later in the show, but we're gonna

52:42.320 --> 52:45.400
be talking about the games that are gonna be shown at E3 this year.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.680
I noticed DDR was not on the list from Konami.

52:47.680 --> 52:51.120
I'm starting to wonder if that project was canceled.

52:51.120 --> 52:53.160
Enter Harmonix!

52:53.160 --> 52:56.280
Just like they did with Guitar Hero.

52:56.280 --> 52:57.280
I just-

52:57.280 --> 52:58.280
Time to start looking forward with our music game.

52:58.280 --> 53:01.640
I just don't understand how they can screw that up so much.

53:01.640 --> 53:08.880
I mean, the problem, I think, with DDR is they need new blood in the game, basically.

53:08.880 --> 53:13.920
They need someone, like myself, to come in and just completely overhaul the damn game,

53:13.920 --> 53:18.760
because what they're doing now, it's just not working.

53:18.760 --> 53:23.160
So they need to go back to square one and just-

53:23.160 --> 53:28.720
Maybe game companies, and maybe I'm giving this with too few examples, but maybe game

53:28.720 --> 53:32.840
companies are finally kind of starting to listen to what the fans want a little bit.

53:32.840 --> 53:36.200
And so Harmonix is like, gosh, the DDR fans kind of want something new.

53:36.200 --> 53:37.200
Here you go.

53:37.200 --> 53:41.940
Just like the Blur people were like, gee, people want to burn out Mario Kart game.

53:41.940 --> 53:42.940
Here you go.

53:42.940 --> 53:43.940
You know?

53:43.940 --> 53:44.940
I don't know.

53:44.940 --> 53:45.940
Maybe it's just me.

53:45.940 --> 53:47.800
It seems like there seems to be a lot more fan service.

53:47.800 --> 53:54.360
You're hearing a lot more, too, about old-ass games coming back from the dead on the iPhone

53:54.360 --> 53:57.560
or on DS, and you've seen that a lot lately.

53:57.560 --> 53:58.560
Unless it's Earthbound.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.160
Happy birthday, by the way, Earthbound.

54:00.160 --> 54:05.720
It's smart that they do listen to their fans, the people that are buying their games, to

54:05.720 --> 54:13.280
make stuff that they intend on purchasing instead of, oh, I don't know, let's recreate

54:13.280 --> 54:15.160
Karaoke Revolution again.

54:15.160 --> 54:16.160
Yeah.

54:16.160 --> 54:21.200
I remember that, because now instead of calling it Karaoke Revolution 4 or whatever the hell

54:21.200 --> 54:24.800
number they were up to, oh, they're just going to re-release this, or release a new game

54:24.800 --> 54:28.120
called Karaoke Revolution, and it's not going to be very different.

54:28.120 --> 54:32.580
It's supposed to have had all this support with download content, but that never happened.

54:32.580 --> 54:38.920
So I just can't buy what Konami's selling nowadays.

54:38.920 --> 54:40.960
I mean, I don't know.

54:40.960 --> 54:41.960
We'll see.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.760
Well, E3 could surprise us.

54:43.760 --> 54:48.760
Castlevania, because apparently that Castlevania game, the multiplayer one, is really legit,

54:48.760 --> 54:50.400
and it should be super awesome.

54:50.400 --> 54:57.840
No, I mean, the Silent Hill game got some good feedback on the Wii.

54:57.840 --> 55:03.160
Konami's got some hype points, but there's just, unfortunately for those of us that liked

55:03.160 --> 55:06.400
a certain aspect of what they were doing many years ago, that is no longer one of their

55:06.400 --> 55:07.400
hype points.

55:07.400 --> 55:12.120
You need to bring the Silent Hill and the Metal Gear Solid arcade games to the Wii.

55:12.120 --> 55:17.160
Or actually now you can bring them out to the PS3 and the Xbox 360, because that'd be

55:17.160 --> 55:18.160
awesome.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
Take a cue from Sega.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.880
Look at House of the Dead 2 and 3.

55:20.880 --> 55:22.120
Awesome game, sold well.

55:22.120 --> 55:25.360
Take a cue from that company who's doing the Rock of the Dead.

55:25.360 --> 55:28.120
That's even cooler.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.360
Come on.

55:29.360 --> 55:30.360
Come on.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.360
Don't do that look.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.360
No, we shouldn't encourage conspiracy.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.900
Yeah, the concept's cool.

55:33.900 --> 55:37.480
It's going to suck, though, unfortunately.

55:37.480 --> 55:41.920
Bond 006 and Chad seems to have a differing opinion on what I was saying about the fans

55:41.920 --> 55:42.920
service.

55:42.920 --> 55:44.640
Tell me about the company kissing the fan's ass.

55:44.640 --> 55:48.480
I take offense to Capcom making Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

55:48.480 --> 55:52.720
I enjoyed 10 years of utter arrogance in telling my friends there will never be Marvel vs.

55:52.720 --> 55:55.640
Capcom 3.

55:55.640 --> 55:59.800
I think you gave another good example of fan service right there.

55:59.800 --> 56:01.760
Like it or not, here it comes, right?

56:01.760 --> 56:02.760
Four words.

56:02.760 --> 56:05.880
Never say never ever.

56:05.880 --> 56:07.160
Especially in gaming, right?

56:07.160 --> 56:12.320
Especially with companies buying each other and people acquiring licenses that once were.

56:12.320 --> 56:15.920
Like who would have thought, going back a few months, who would have thought we would

56:15.920 --> 56:19.720
have ever got a sequel to Blaster Master?

56:19.720 --> 56:20.720
I mean, right?

56:20.720 --> 56:24.820
I mean, granted, it was not as good as it could have been, but it was a sequel to Blaster

56:24.820 --> 56:25.820
Master.

56:25.820 --> 56:30.200
If DC and Marvel can hook up, anything's possible.

56:30.200 --> 56:33.040
Buying a commando re-armed, that's all I have to say.

56:33.040 --> 56:34.600
That was awesome.

56:34.600 --> 56:38.880
Sin and Punishment Sky successor from Ray Ayanami in chat, that's true, that's Sin and Punishment

56:38.880 --> 56:39.880
games all.

56:39.880 --> 56:44.880
And, you know, what's sad about that is it's not gonna sell well, and it's gonna be considered

56:44.880 --> 56:48.840
probably a failure on Nintendo's part, and you won't see that many games like that.

56:48.840 --> 56:52.080
Big words, Loki, what's to say that?

56:52.080 --> 56:53.080
Why you say that?

56:53.080 --> 56:59.840
Because every single mature or niche game on the Wii has not sold well.

56:59.840 --> 57:00.960
All of them.

57:00.960 --> 57:02.080
Think about this topic for next week.

57:02.080 --> 57:04.560
I don't want to get into it tonight because we're running a little long anyway, but just

57:04.560 --> 57:07.800
think about this topic for next week and write it down mentally in case I forget, because

57:07.800 --> 57:12.560
I want to go through the different three press conferences, and I want to kind of ask this

57:12.560 --> 57:15.520
question, and maybe this is a good email topic, too, for those of you guys who want to email

57:15.520 --> 57:19.800
us this week, mailbagorangeandreadea.com, because we're gonna talk a lot pre-E3 next

57:19.800 --> 57:20.800
week.

57:20.800 --> 57:25.880
What could the big three do, Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, at their press conferences to make

57:25.880 --> 57:28.580
you a rabid fanboy all over again?

57:28.580 --> 57:32.160
And silly answers are fine, but give me some serious ones, too.

57:32.160 --> 57:36.480
I'm gonna tell you right now what Sony's gotta do, and it's so simple and so obvious.

57:36.480 --> 57:39.040
All right, all right, but now I want to change topics, because I don't want to ruin next

57:39.040 --> 57:40.040
week.

57:40.040 --> 57:42.360
And I feel really bad for not knowing the guy's name, but the guy that they have in

57:42.360 --> 57:46.960
their commercials right now needs to be running that damn conference.

57:46.960 --> 57:47.960
Really?

57:47.960 --> 57:48.960
Yeah.

57:48.960 --> 57:49.960
Interesting.

57:49.960 --> 57:55.640
He's the best marketing campaign ever for Sony.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.080
I would actually agree.

57:57.080 --> 58:03.080
For a company that's had lots of missteps, lots of missteps, remember the black and white

58:03.080 --> 58:04.080
PSP?

58:04.080 --> 58:05.080
Yeah?

58:05.080 --> 58:06.080
Remember that?

58:06.080 --> 58:07.080
Yeah.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.080
Remember the God of War lamb being served up?

58:08.080 --> 58:09.080
Yeah.

58:09.080 --> 58:10.080
For a company...

58:10.080 --> 58:11.080
Cover the crane, baby.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.080
Yeah.

58:12.080 --> 58:13.720
This is a direction they should stick with.

58:13.720 --> 58:14.720
I'll give you that.

58:14.720 --> 58:17.400
I totally agree, and I'm sure that guy will be at E3.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.800
Yeah, Kevin Butler, I think, was his name, or whatever.

58:20.800 --> 58:21.800
Yeah.

58:21.800 --> 58:24.160
He'll be there.

58:24.160 --> 58:25.480
And our chat is lighting up.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.480
Kevin Butler.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.480
He's great.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.680
He's the man, says Blaze.

58:28.680 --> 58:29.680
Black Wolf says he's an actor.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.120
I hope he does the intro.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.120
I don't care.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.120
I just hope he's there.

58:33.120 --> 58:34.120
We'll see what happens.

58:34.120 --> 58:35.680
All right, let's move on, though, guys.

58:35.680 --> 58:36.680
We'll talk a little more E3 next week.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.520
In fact, I hope he's in every press conference.

58:39.520 --> 58:41.600
Here's one of the rumors about what's going to be seen.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.960
Big, big, fat rumor, but it's kind of one of those rumors you look at and go, okay,

58:44.960 --> 58:46.400
I can see that.

58:46.400 --> 58:53.700
Apparently Hulu is being teased as a possible addition to the Xbox 360.

58:53.700 --> 58:56.640
This is coming from Gear Live, which is a tech site.

58:56.640 --> 59:00.560
Apparently they have picked up on a rumor that Hulu's streaming functionality, it's

59:00.560 --> 59:04.240
going to be in the Xbox 360, it's going to be announced at E3.

59:04.240 --> 59:09.480
One Up ran with the same rumor, saying that a Hulu application for the Xbox 360 definitely

59:09.480 --> 59:16.720
exists, but the problem right now, it's tied up with rights issues.

59:16.720 --> 59:20.000
Everybody wants a piece of the rights to the application.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
What do you guys think?

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Hulu on the 360.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.960
Again, for those of you that don't know Hulu, Hulu's a website.

59:24.960 --> 59:31.040
It was kind of launched as a competitor to YouTube, but instead of focusing on user-based

59:31.040 --> 59:33.960
content, it kind of takes your favorite TV shows.

59:33.960 --> 59:38.000
What I like best, a lot of old TV shows are showing up on there, too.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.180
When I say old, I mean old and forgotten.

59:41.180 --> 59:47.640
One of the awesome shows that's on there right now, the Dark Shadows revival from 1990 is

59:47.640 --> 59:50.280
on Hulu, all of the episodes.

59:50.280 --> 59:51.280
I know.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.280
It's awesome that it's there.

59:52.280 --> 59:56.160
I mean, prepare to be disappointed by the cliffhanger ending, because the show got canceled

59:56.160 --> 59:57.160
midway through.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.200
But, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff like that that I think would be a great addition

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.880
to the Xbox 360.

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.880
What do you guys think?

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.880
Fact or crap?

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.880
Hulu on the 360.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880
I think it definitely could happen.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880
It makes sense.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.600
I think it could happen.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.920
Going off the old standby that all rumors are, in fact, true, I could see it happening

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.200
too.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.600
It's just a good alternative to Netflix.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.540
The thing I didn't like, though, is they were saying that they were going to possibly charge

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:24.080
more money to access Hulu on the 360.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:30.360
Which, if that's the case, that's retarded, because, I mean, if you just use your PC and

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.040
stream your PC to your 360, you can watch Hulu for free.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.960
So why should I have to pay extra money?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.800
Bochikawa in our chat says, yeah, all the consoles have internets.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.440
Why couldn't you watch them on it already?

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.440
Well, I don't believe...

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440
They block it.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.240
Yeah, it's blocked on the PS3, right, and then I don't think the Wii has a high enough

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.480
flash version, and the Xbox 360, don't forget, it's missing a web browser.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:56.680
I know, a lot of people think, just assume, oh yeah, I can surf the web on my 360.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.680
Actually, you can't.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.440
Well, it makes sense why they don't do that, because there's already enough holes in their

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.200
security.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:10.620
And Wyland in our chat room says, if you want Dark Shadows, watch the original 1,245 episodes.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.560
Bring them to Hulu, and maybe I'll start.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:17.320
Although from what I understand, you don't really start watching Dark Shadows until about

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.360
episode, like, what is it, like 75, or whenever Barnabus is finally actually first introduced.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.160
You can just kind of skip the first few.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.920
That's what I'm understanding anyway, but I could be wrong.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:35.600
All right, anyhow, so it sounds like it could be a fact we will find out in a week.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.600
Because if it's not announced at E3, then it's not coming this year, that's for sure.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.560
Dark Soccer, what you got for us?

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:52.560
Well, this is more Xbox news, but basically, Robbie Bach, who is the entertainment dude,

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.560
has retiring.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.800
There was a memo that went out that said that he is retiring.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.120
The memo was out by Steve Ballmer.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:08.080
And also, Jay Allard is going to be retiring as well.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:14.280
You gotta wonder if that means, like, retiring, like the little quotes there, like, retiring,

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.320
or having their butt pushed out the door.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.200
Like, you know, there's always that kind of like, hmm, because, I mean, it's not like,

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.240
I don't think Jay Allard is 65.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.480
He's not quite of that retirement age.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:28.800
But they've just been there for a while, and basically Xbox is printing money.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.920
Although, weren't they tied to a failure that Xbox had?

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.560
Wasn't there something, not Xbox.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:40.600
I'd say that Microsoft was supposed to launch, was it a tablet computer or something?

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:41.600
Something like that.

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.440
Yeah, that didn't do, and I'm sure someone in chat will jump in, that didn't, I don't

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:50.280
think ended up happening at all, and now it's everybody's iPad, iPad, iPad, so, I mean,

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.440
it's just not going to happen there at Microsoft, so.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.480
I wonder how they thought they could compete with Apple over that.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:05.020
Some of our people in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, guest9595, I wish you'd change their name

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:09.640
so I could give them proper credit, but guest9595 says, hey, can't you watch Hulu and stuff

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.840
with play on for any of the systems?

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:19.720
That's right, that little software that lets you transfer your stuff over to the TV, right?

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:23.920
Well, I mean, there's that, there's, I prefer diversity.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:29.680
I mean, you can stream Hulu, I use my PS3 to do that, and that works really well, so,

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.720
I mean, it works just the same on a 360, but yeah, you can do that, and that's what I'm

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720
saying.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.720
Why should I pay the extra?

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.720
The thing I'm guessing is it's going to be HD streaming, maybe, and you're going to get,

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:47.120
you know, one of the rumors was they're going to start charging for Hulu if you want to

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.320
watch some of the archive episodes.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.240
The recent episodes will be free, but the stuff past, like, you know, the first or second

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.240
most recent episodes.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.360
Well, that's at the website now, isn't it?

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.180
Like, you can watch the last five episodes of Glee, but if you want to watch anything

01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.600
older than that, you can't.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.800
Yeah, but they're going to allow you to, but you're going to have the bill to pay, so.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:06.680
Good thing I don't want to watch any episodes of that.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:12.040
Well, you're missing out, and that's how Sue sees it.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.960
I tried, and it made me feel a little nauseous.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.400
You and Alan should start a club, because he hates it too.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.480
All right, what else was I going to say?

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.880
Oh, about the Hulu and the pay thing.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.320
I guess maybe this wouldn't really be tied together, because it's kind of, you know,

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.240
Microsoft and Hulu, but remember last week, I kind of went off on this whole project $10,

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.960
and I said, why the hell are we paying for Xbox Live anymore?

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.080
Well, I mean, this is a feature that maybe could keep me an Xbox Live Gold member.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.080
Hmm?

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.080
Maybe?

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.080
Hmm?

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:50.840
You know, and I'm just, and we're going to get into some project $10 stuff soon, but

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:56.760
just to kind of talk about it, I'm mad at the idea of it, and the reason I'm mad at

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.200
the idea is not necessarily that it affects me, but it affects a lot of other people,

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:05.040
because me personally, I either buy new games, or I don't buy the games, and not necessarily

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.240
that I wouldn't buy used games, but I mean, if there's a game that I don't think I'm

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.280
going to be playing, I probably won't pick it up, just because I know myself, and I know

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:20.200
that if I buy a game that I'm not so hot on, I won't end up playing it.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:28.040
It'll just be sitting, collecting dust, so for me, it's not such a big deal, but,

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:32.560
you know, if you just let one thing slide, then it's just going to be a whole mess of

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:39.080
crap that's going to, you know, come out later on, so that's why I'm kind of pissed off

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.880
that EA's doing the whole project $10 thing, and then now THQ's following suit with that,

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.560
and as I rumored last week, Microsoft will probably be following suit with that as well,

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:53.440
and if Microsoft does it, then we'll have other people doing it, and...

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440
Why not?

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.440
Go for it.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.440
You want to talk more project $10.

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:57.440
Who else?

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.440
Who's going in?

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:04.800
Sega is considering joining some sort of online pass system.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.880
This is me scolding Sega.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.880
Sega!

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:15.360
And, you know, basically, Ubisoft is also kind of liking the idea, and Sega is saying,

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:20.760
you know, it's a very clever idea, and they're certainly taking looks to see what happens

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:27.240
with it, and they're saying of course, you know, that they want to be careful to make

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.880
sure that, you know, the EA, you know, sports thing that they're doing right now actually

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:36.760
works out, and, you know, the backlash isn't too big, but if it ends up working out for

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:42.560
them, then perhaps they will allow you to, they will do something very similar.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:46.960
What's kind of funny, though, is, you know, we were talking about the whole online pass

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:52.520
thing and the project $10 stuff with EA, and one of the theories was they wanted to kind

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.600
of put this out there so that they can make some money from used sales, and also it may

01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:02.840
curb a little bit of the piracy because the fact that, you know, if you, at least if you're

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.080
pirating the game and you want to play it online, you still have to pay them some money.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.960
So, you know, that might be one reason.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:20.560
But then, EA's, I guess, UK General Manager Keith Ramsdale basically made a comment and

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:26.640
said, no, actually the project $10 online pass are not about that.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.320
It's all about the customer and improving their experience.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:37.440
It's simply not a defensive measure against pre-owned or piracy.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:41.760
I'm sorry, my bullshit meter was going off.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.200
I mean, if that isn't a bunch of corporate speak.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.320
Improving the customer experience, come on.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.320
That's retarded then.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.880
I would rather they come out and say, yeah, it's actually the curb piracy and used sales

01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:00.880
because now the fact that you're saying no, it's actually just to make your online play

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.360
even better, but the online play isn't changing, then that just means no, you're actually just

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.360
grabbing at money.

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:11.880
At least, you know, give it the, you know, excuse that, oh, we're actually just trying

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.440
to make some money off of used sales.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.240
Actually, don't even bother with the used sales.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.800
So say you're just using it to combat piracy.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.440
I mean, because everybody is like, okay, piracy, you know, that makes sense.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:29.480
But I'm sorry, I don't play a lot of EA games, at least not the sports stuff.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:35.940
So I mean, I'm guessing just looking at this stuff that, you know, Tiger Woods PGA Tour

01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:40.880
11 when it's coming out on Tuesday here, I'm guessing that the online play is not going

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.520
to be that different from Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:48.160
And by all means, people should really look into that, because if this is their claim

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.000
that, oh, we're doing this to the benefit of, you know, our consumers, then you need

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
to look at...

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.440
I think you should write a comparison for OrangeLongTraded.com.

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:59.640
I don't want to play Tiger Woods 10 or 11.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.840
Scour on the internet, or don't you get access to games through your job or something?

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840
No.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:11.960
You know, so they need to look at, you know, 10 and 11 to see, okay, was 10, the latency

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:19.200
better in 11, is, you know, the options better in 11, and all this stuff, because I bet you

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.640
if you look at that, it's not.

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.680
I bet you it's the same damn shit all over again.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.040
And it really doesn't make any sense that they're charging people they're buying used

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:32.000
for these games, because they've already gotten the money for these games.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.860
There's no reason they need more money for these games.

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:39.240
You're not adding more users to the online, because this is still one copy of a game that's

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.600
floating around out there.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.640
You've already made your money.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:47.520
So if you can't run your, you know, infrastructure on the money that you've made, you know, on

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.760
new games, it just doesn't make any sense, because what if, which is, it's not going

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:58.680
to happen, but what if, you know, say, you know, this whole online passing ends up flopping,

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.920
and you're not making any money for, you know, the online games.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.440
People aren't paying to play online more than that seven-day trial.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:08.760
Well then nothing changes.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.760
Then nothing changes.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.680
Because that's not going to motivate them to get rid of it, because they're still going

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.200
to make money off new games.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.200
Exactly.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.880
And if you think about it though, you know, what are they hoping to accomplish by this?

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.840
They're hoping that people either buy the game new, or they're going to basically, you

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.240
know, hope that they pay the ten dollars or whatever, five dollars, to actually play online.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:36.000
But if people don't pay that, and they don't receive enough revenue, then guess what?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.240
The online experience doesn't change at all.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:46.320
So basically making their whole point, you know, you know, nonsense.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.920
Because if they're not making money from this extra use sales, and using it to improve their

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.560
service, then they're full of shit.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.560
Alright.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.360
Uh, let's move on with another story, because this is like three weeks in a row we've talked

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.000
about this stupid thing now.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It's because it's dumb.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.600
I know, I know, I know, and it's something new is coming up every week, and sadly we're

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.560
probably going to hear even more about it at E3, and what other companies are going

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.040
to jump on board, yippie yippie.

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.000
Speaking of things that are full of bullshit, somebody has filed a lawsuit against Sony

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.760
and Square Enix, because Final Fantasy 13 caused severe and widespread damage to PlayStation

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.320
3 consoles.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.680
It was filed by Daniel Wolf, it's a class action lawsuit, meaning if he wins you'll

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.080
all get a piece of this.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:42.040
But Wolf reckons that it freezes, and PlayStation 3s, and when you play this you can get your

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:47.720
PS3 console to become totally and permanently inoperable.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:51.600
The lawsuit says both defendants are eminently aware of the damage being caused by their

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.360
defective products, and have chosen to do nothing about it.

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:02.040
They're being sued, I guess, for over 5 million in damages, and relief is being sought.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.600
Meaning that, you know, if you are affected by you having both of these things, you could

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.400
get your very own coupon for $5 in the mail, that'll probably be the piece of this that

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:11.620
you're entitled to.

01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:13.800
That's usually what happens with these class action lawsuits.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800
Whatever.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800
I mean...

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.800
It doesn't make any sense, because it's not widespread.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:25.220
Was Xbox, I know, did Xbox ever have to settle for the Red Rings of Death thing?

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.280
Because in my opinion, that was a much bigger problem.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:33.920
I think that's why they extended the warranty to three years, I thought.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920
But I could be wrong.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.120
But it doesn't matter, because this isn't widespread.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.360
Where are your data on this?

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.360
Where is the data?

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360
Seriously, because...

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.840
Rob, you own Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:51.000
Is your PS3 inoperable because of Final Fantasy XIII?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.720
No, but there was that one day, like what, March 1st or whatever, when all the clocks

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.780
were fucked up, remember that?

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:02.840
But that wouldn't be because of Final Fantasy XIII since it came out after that.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:06.720
So I mean, I don't know.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.120
I would think that that would be hard to prove in the first place.

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:18.020
That there is widespread damage, because it's like a dude, saying, oh, my system crashed.

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:23.520
By the way, just randomly asking this question, how many of you remember the one day the PS3s

01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.520
were down?

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.080
I bet most of you forgot.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.400
And that was only about three months ago.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.400
Just saying.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400
There was that, remember that one day?

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.400
Yeah, I remember that one day.

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.780
Yes, yeah, it was one day.

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.240
Three months ago, going retro here on a lot.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.480
In case you forgot, too, Activision was being total dicks to Infinity Ward as well.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.060
Just refreshing that.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.160
We should do that every week.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.880
We should have like, hey, you know, in case you forgot.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.480
Never, we'll have a segment called Never Forget.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.520
Never Forget.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520
Never Forget.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.040
Remember that time that Namco's really pissed off at us?

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.040
Never Forget.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.760
I like it, man.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.160
We're full of ideas this month.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160
I like that.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.320
I think that should be a segment that we do regularly.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320
For Forget.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320
Never Forget.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.320
Never.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.680
It should be Never Forget.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.680
Never Forget.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.680
Never Forget.

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.680
Oh, no, we should do that on the website.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.680
There you go.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.320
Oh, that is a wonderful idea for a series of articles.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:24.440
I don't, is there an OLR fan that maybe wants to pick that up?

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:29.680
But we need to do actually more stuff that's like, you know, a lot older than just the

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680
Infinity Ward thing.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680
Because that's pretty recent.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.520
Well, I bet some people are forgetting about it, though, already.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:35.520
I understand that.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.520
I mean, out of sight, out of mind.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:39.920
When that stuff stops getting reported in the media, people are like, oh, yeah, I was

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.400
really mad about that.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.400
Like, that happened.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.520
I was listening to an old OLR randomly the other day, I don't know why, and it was not

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.520
that old.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.520
Like, a couple months ago.

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:55.680
And I was talking about how the, remember when Xbox, Never Forget.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:59.940
When Xbox Live used to discriminate against the word gay being in your profile.

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.720
But they did get rid of that.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.200
But I remember when I, I think we were reporting it here on the show.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.560
And I was like, oh, yeah, I was really mad about that when that first happened.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.160
But I kind of forgot that that had happened.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.720
So we do need a Never Forget, so that, like, things that I get mad about, and you get mad

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.300
about, and Jamie gets mad about, we never forget.

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.800
Maybe it could be like a page on the wiki.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:28.600
And when one of us says, Never Forget this, somebody can add it to the wiki, so that way

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.160
we never forget.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.720
Ah, yes.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.720
I like that idea.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.560
People are crazy.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.360
Whatever.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.360
You know it's a good idea.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.360
It's a dark circle.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.480
Surely there's something in your mind.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.200
You're like, you know what, never forget that this happened.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.280
Never forget that people are bitches.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.360
Well that's just a given.

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.760
That has nothing to do with gaming.

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.760
It's alright.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:59.080
Okay, never forget the crystalline entity is a bitch.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.080
There you go.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.720
Now you're, now you're on the right track.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.640
Never forget Half-Life 2 Episode 3 still isn't out yet.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.160
But maybe, maybe that's why the Portal 2 thing was canceled, because they're gonna show Half-Life.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:14.560
Here's the thing, I think the Portal 2 thing is still happening, but I think that they're

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.640
under, you know, they're all, yeah, the event was canceled, but you know, then there's gonna

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.720
be like, oh haha, Aperture Science has trapped you all, and now you must run through this

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.720
maze.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.800
Let Jamie get her thought out, and then I've got an idea on that.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:31.320
Well, from what I was reading, though, Half-Life 3 is gonna have, actually, Shell from Portal

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:38.040
is supposed to be making her appearance, and then they also are talking about the, um,

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:41.800
what's the name of that ship that Aperture put out, that's supposed to show up?

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.160
Oh, it's a cameo at the end of Portal, isn't it?

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160
I think?

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:56.040
No, they, they mention it in that retooled portal, but um, but like, it's some ship that,

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.200
of Aperture's that crashed or something, but anyway, I don't remember the whole deal.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.280
Okay, here's what I was supposed to say about the Portal 2 party, um, is that, I bet what

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.120
they're doing, like, did you hear that really fucked up story, never forget this, by the

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.360
way, did you hear that really fucked up story about that school in, like, Mississippi or

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.240
whatever, where the, the girl wanted to go to the prom with her girlfriend, but they

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.120
were like, no, cause you're a dirty lesbian, and we're not gonna have that happen in our

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:24.200
prom, da da da, and what they did, you know what they ended up doing?

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:30.360
They threw another prom, and invited, like, her and her girlfriend and like, eight school

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:35.280
misfits to, like, the fake prom, and they had, like, a real prom somewhere else.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.280
Yeah, that was crap.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.040
That was fucked up beyond belief, right?

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.800
What if that's what they're doing with the Portal 2 party?

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:46.840
They're like, sorry guys, the Portal 2 party got cancelled.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.000
I seriously think- But then suddenly we'll see these reports

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
on the internet about, oh, oh, oh, well 1UP.com got invited to this, uh, this super secret

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
party.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.400
No, I seriously think that they're gonna actually have, it's gonna be this, you know, oh, it's

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.840
actually a secret surprise, and then, you know, the surprise is, oh, look at this, you

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:08.840
know, the, you know, GLaDOS has, uh, hacked the conference or something, you know, something

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.040
ridiculous like that.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.480
Salacious Pop saves the day, Dark Sakura.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.000
The Borealis is the ship.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
That was it.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
There you go.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.920
I knew it had some sort of celestial name.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:25.440
No, that's, like, the Aurora Borealis.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.160
And Bobby's reminding us that he was supposed to go to the Portal 2 party and he's a misfit

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.160
now.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.760
So, sorry, Bobby Black Wolf, but, uh, it very well could be that you have something in common

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.760
with a lesbian in Mississippi.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760
Off to the island with you.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.440
I'll throw you your improv.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.640
That's okay, Bobby.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.740
I didn't get invited to anything, so we can have drinks.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.740
I take that back.

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:47.200
I, I, I do have an appointment to see Rock Band 3.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.200
Whoo!

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.200
What?

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.200
So, there's that.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.200
Remember, steal a keytar.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.200
Okay.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.200
Lord.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.640
Then you'll really be reading about that on the blog, the blogs.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:00.800
All right, look, let's move on, uh, Dark Sakura.

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.840
We need, we need a dose of, like, something really cool and awesome in this show.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.840
How about some class?

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.840
All right.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:07.840
We need, this show could use a little class.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.560
Actually, this show could use a lot of class.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.640
More class than a class action lawsuit.

01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:18.280
Anyway, first, I must preface this by saying that it is about the recently knighted Sir

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.280
Patrick Stewart.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.240
Whoo!

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:23.240
That makes me happy.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.240
About damn time.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.440
So, now, you must address him as Sir Patrick Stewart.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.440
Sir Patrick Stewart.

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.440
Patrick Stewart.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:35.800
At, at, at any rate, um, he's basically on record saying that he loves his beautiful

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:41.640
iPhone, that it has become an extension of himself, that he couldn't imagine going without

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.480
it or his laptop, but that he has a stack of video games.

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.200
I want to hear Patrick Stewart narrate a story about how much he loves his iPhone.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.400
There's a video on this one, too.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400
Really?

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:53.400
Talking about it.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:20:02.440
Um, but, um, he's saying that, um, he has, um, in fact, I'll read the quote, the only

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:07.320
aspect of all this that I've never taken to in part because I have an addictive temperament

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.320
is gaming.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:12.240
I have a stack of games that I've never taken the covers off of because I feel that if I

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.960
do I'm finished.

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.840
Can I just listen to a little bit of Patrick Stewart?

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.840
Yes.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:18.840
Can I, can I just listen to his voice?

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840
Okay, first of all, Rob.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.840
What?

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:21.840
Did you see him in Jeffrey?

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.840
Yeah.

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:23.840
Years ago.

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.840
God, I love it.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.840
I love him in that movie.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.840
Shh.

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.840
Shh.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.840
Shh.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.840
Shh.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:31.840
Shh.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:32.840
Everybody worship.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.840
Seems to me to be a little bit simplistic.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.280
Maybe I like complexity and, uh, abstraction too much.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:47.000
Um, but on the other hand, I just handed someone my beautiful iPhone, which I never have out

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.960
of my hand and that I do everything with and has become an extension of who I am.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.520
I travel with my laptop everywhere.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.360
Emails are absolutely sexual in my life.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.360
His voice.

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.360
It sounds like he said sexual in my life.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.360
He did say sexual.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.360
Didn't he?

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.920
He could just read the phone book to me.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.920
Sorry.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.560
That was, and that was really quiet over the feed.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.560
I apologize guys.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.560
I don't know why it's so quiet.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.560
Oh, beautiful.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560
I know, right?

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:16.560
Sorry.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560
Patrick Stewart.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560
Sorry.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560
Tiger, sir.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:20.560
Patrick Stewart.

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.560
Sir Patrick Stewart.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.560
Sir.

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:23.560
Patrick Stewart.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.560
Sir.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:25.560
So haha.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:26.560
All you people who don't like Apple.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.560
Haha.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.560
All right.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560
Patrick.

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:30.560
Sir.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560
Patrick Stewart endorses it.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560
Haha.

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.560
It's just cause he hasn't touched a droid, right?

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:35.560
Loki.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:38.080
Not since the days of Star Trek, the next generation has he ever touched a droid.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.080
Uh, Loki.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.480
How about some release dates?

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.560
Release dates traveling around the globe, talking about what's coming out in a neighborhood

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:46.560
near you.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:47.560
Yes.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.920
Um, this week, yeah, not a lot.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.760
There's just some weird stuff and, uh, some decent stuff.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.320
So let's start with the weird stuff.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.320
America's next top model on DS and the Wii.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.320
Sorry.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.320
Wait a minute.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:04.320
I thought that was supposed to come out like two weeks ago cause I remember cracking a-

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.320
I'm sorry.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.000
As soon as Loki said that I had to yawn really bad.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Hey, listen.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.080
I remember cracking a Tyra Banks is crazy joke.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.760
I understand that and she is crazy, but you know, it'll come out when it's ready to come

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:17.760
out.

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.760
Just like Tyra.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:23.760
Uh, Call of Duty, the war collection, uh, making its way out on Xbox 360.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.760
Yes.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:25.760
It's a bunch of rereleases.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.760
Um, let's see.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.960
I wonder if the top model game will have a panty party in it.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:36.480
If you've never seen this YouTube, you need to YouTube, Google this on YouTube or whatever,

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.480
YouTube it.

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.240
Um, Tyra Banks panty party.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.680
It's the funniest thing I've ever seen on the Tyra Banks show.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:50.440
She goes, we're going to have a panty party.

01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:51.520
Sorry random piggy.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:56.480
I've been, I've been a woman most of my life.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.160
I was a girl before that.

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:01.360
I've never had a panty party.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.000
You haven't lived.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.880
How about a manty party?

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.600
No thank you.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:12.480
Uh, let's play ballerina on the DS.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.760
Let's hope they never put out let's play doctor because that will be very inappropriate.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:21.760
Uh, green day rock band coming out on Wii, PlayStation three and Xbox 360.

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.840
They also have a rock band green day rock band plus in case you don't want to pay for

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:31.200
the extra $10 to dump your songs.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.800
Um, it's included in the price this time and it's still $10 more, but you get some free

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:37.800
download content.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.800
So that's cool.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.800
I guess.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:47.240
Uh, vacation isle beach party on the Wii yet another sports game, uh, Western writing Academy

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.440
on the DS fund.

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.080
Uh, this is kind of cool.

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:56.360
Mega man zero collection on the DS, that'd be a pretty good one.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:05.320
Uh, Samantha Swift and the hidden roses of Athena on the Nintendo DS, uh, Disgaea infinite

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:06.320
on PSP.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:08.800
What are you giggling about over there?

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:15.680
Marissa can gusto's comment and chat green day rock band play three chords on your balls.

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:22.320
Maybe that's the new instrument in a rock band three, your balls.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.560
You can do harmonies with your balls.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:32.880
Clearly it's nothing but David Bowie songs, if that's the case.

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:39.760
Satisfashion rock the runway on DS and I think that's also on the Wii as well.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:46.520
Why do I know this, uh, Tiger Woods, PGA tour 11 on PlayStation three, Xbox 360 and PC.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:51.440
Oh, and also on the Wii, uh, Prince of Persia, the forgotten sands fans to make its way out

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.520

01:24:53.520 --> 01:25:00.840

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:14.720
Let's play garden on the Nintendo DS and that is it.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.840
Do you have the time to listen to me whine about a bunch of release dates for, uh, Japan?

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:25.040
Uh, stuff that's coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 grand theft auto episodes

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040
from Liberty city.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040
That's right.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.040
The localized version, uh, the retail release, June 10th, just cause to also this week in

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.080
Japan and saints row two gets a price reduction.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.480
The platinum collection, by the way, Loki, one of the big rumblings about what's coming

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.080
at E3 this year, saints row three.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.400
Yeah, but it's not being released until next year and that makes me sad.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.200
Although seeing how far that they went with, um, the red faction in the new red faction

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.800
Armageddon game, or I think it's Armageddon is the subtitle on that.

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.800
It looks awesome.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:55.300
And if that looks awesome, saints row three is going to be that much more awesome.

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.880
It's going to be more awesomer and that should be what's on the title.

01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:03.280
More awesomer than saints row two, uh, PlayStation three gets the same stuff.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.280
That's right.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.800
Grand theft auto episodes from Liberty city, just cause two and saints row two, all the

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:13.960
same stuff on the PS three over in Japan this week, Nintendo, we gets karaoke joy sound.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.760
We Enka that comes with a USB microphone, Enka game.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:19.960
That's what it says.

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.720
That's coming from Hudson.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:22.720
Do you know what Enka is?

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.480
Um, it's like the Japanese version of folk country music.

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.480
Oh yes.

01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:28.480
I have heard some of that.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.480
Remember me playing you Jero?

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.480
Yes.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480
I remember that.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.480
Oh boy.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480
Yeah.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:38.600
It looks like, I don't know if it's like a super popular version of their karaoke revolution

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.600
or what, but that is coming out over there.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.600
That's super popular though.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.840
I'm not surprised, I'm actually surprised it took this one to get an Enka game out.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.360
Well, there's also a duets game coming out if you want to check that out too.

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:51.680
So a dark Sakura might be importing the Wii Enka.

01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.680
I don't know.

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.680
A Zeno blade.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.680
I don't know any Enka songs.

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.680
Also comes out this week.

01:26:55.680 --> 01:26:59.600
Well, you can learn some, but Zeno blade, this is kind of a big deal.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.260
You guys, Zeno blade is coming out on the Wii in Japan this week.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.260
So there you go.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.840
That's, that's going to be a pretty big title out there.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.440
RPG of course.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.520
Coming over to the handhelds for a minute and checking out what's coming out on the

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:15.520
Nintendo DS this week.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:19.160
On the Nintendo DS this week, you have Rockman Zero Collection.

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.240
That's a pretty big deal.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:26.280
As well as Marugokaku Shikaku Dasu Gaishiyoshi Seiken comes out this week.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.000
Boy, that's a mouthful.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.120
What is this game all about?

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.120
I don't know.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.120
That's what she said.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:35.960
Because there's nothing on the cover that I can understand except a little picture.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.240
It looks like navigation software could be.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:42.000
So that's probably going to be completely useless to you here in the US and I just wasted

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.520
30 seconds of your time.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.960
So let's move to the PSP and talk about what is coming out on the PSP this week over in

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.320
Japan.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:54.320
Wand of Fortune Portable is the big release on the PSP this week.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.360
Wand of Fortune Portable from Idea Factory, an adventure game.

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:03.280
I don't see any screenshots, but the characters look like anime Harry Potter people, so I'm

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:04.320
sure that'll be fun.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.160
Never forget Zelda, Wand of Gamelon.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.520
Oh god, was that the 3DO game?

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.520
Yes.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.520
One of them.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:13.520
Oh, cry.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.400
I played that at a classic gaming expo a couple years ago.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.800
It was terrible.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.120
Good times.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.440
Alright, Dark Sakura.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.960
How about the old country?

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:29.160
Well, really not a whole lot.

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.760
On the 8th is Green Day Rock Band.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.760
Yay.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.960
9th is Joe Danger.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:42.080
And then toward the end of the week, on the 11th, we have King Arthur, Mega Man Zero Collection,

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:47.200
Naval Assault the Killing Tide, and Super Mario Galaxy 2.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:48.200
The end.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.800
It's over!

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:53.200
By the way, surprise that no one in studio had anything to say on Super Mario Galaxy

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.200
2.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.080
My Wii is still not hooked up, that's why I haven't bought the game yet, but I am hearing

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:59.800
phenomenal things about the game.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.800
So have I.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.800
I just kinda...

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.120
I know, it's kind of under the radar right now.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:05.600
It's kinda one of those games I hope I can go back to and play at some point, but for

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.000
right now it's kind of on the back burner.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.080
But yeah, I've heard lots and lots of good things about Mario Galaxy 2.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.560
Apparently outshines the first.

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.520
Well, that'll be impressive.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.760
Yeah, the first was not a bad game at all.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.160
Perhaps Nintendo can send me a free copy once I pimp out my room in New Super Mario Bros.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.160
Eh?

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:24.160
Eh?

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.160
You should try it.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.160
You never know.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160
You know, future gamer.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:28.160
No.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.520
Teaching them young.

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.000
I'm telling you, when you do that to your kid, your kid's gonna rebel.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.240
You're gonna have a kid that wants to go out and play football all day?

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.280
I don't care if he wants to go play football, that's fine with me.

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:44.000
I'm not forcing him to like video games, that's just the theme we're doing his room in.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000
He can do whatever he wants.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.160
If he wants to go work on cars and play football and that kind of stuff, that's fine with me.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:52.960
He won't though.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:59.800
My mom was a painter, and so she painted my room all in Sesame Street characters.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:06.760
See, I guess it could work that way, because my parents gave me a baseball mitt and football

01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:13.880
and stuff like that, but my dad, on the other hand, he bought a ColecoVision for himself

01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:18.380
and Atari games and stuff, and then I just naturally started playing those, they bought

01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:20.160
me a Texas Instruments computer.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.600
That's right, because you were born in like 81, right?

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600
When all that was out?

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600
I was 80.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.600
80?

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600
Okay, 80.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:31.080
When all that stuff came out, and just naturally I got into it, and the stuff that I was into

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:38.240
like when I was that old, you know, I'm into now even more so.

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.240
I don't know.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:42.320
I'm not going to force it upon them, I'm not going to like, you have to play games, because

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.040
my wife hates games, which is ironic that she suggested that we do a Mario Brothers

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:48.040
themed room.

01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.360
I never would have thought that.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.360
I know.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.360
I'm surprised.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.520
Well, your wife does have those random moments of gaming.

01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:56.760
Like you know, she loves Bejeweled, right?

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.380
And there's other stuff she's played too, right?

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:02.520
She said that we couldn't do the pixelated Mario on the wall.

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:06.840
She didn't want the old school Mario, because she wanted it cutesy and bright and colorful

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.720
and I guess Mario, you know, New Super Mario Brothers, you know, those stuff, because we

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.800
were originally just going to do just the decals on the wall, but the problem is those

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:22.520
decals that you buy for like $70 a sheet, which is really ridiculous, they only have

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:28.640
so much ground, it's like four feet worth of the ground vinyl, and we just can't circle

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.960
the room with that stuff, so we have to paint everything.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.800
I mean, I'm not going to spend, you know, money to buy enough sheets to cover the whole

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.800
room.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800
It'd be ridiculous.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.160
Why are all the guests leaving the funny comments tonight?

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:44.000
Guest 5872, please change your name, folks, when you get in there, type slash Nick, and

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.240
then the new name, and I can credit you if I really...

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.480
Or you get booted.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:53.560
Tsukibon Satu-rena, you should do this room in President Cat.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.960
Clearly it's a listener of the show.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:01.560
We almost did it in Stella theme, Stella would be my cat, so, but that would be weird.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:02.560
Kitty theme.

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.280
She is a little bitch.

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:13.300
She wants me to play, because we made her a toy out of bag handles, these little like

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:18.660
string handles or whatever, and we tied them together, and now she'll go like drag this

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:23.560
thing around me, and if I don't play with her, then she starts biting me, so she's a

01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:24.560
little bitch sometimes.

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.560
But I love her.

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.560
She locked her in a room with Shermie.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.560
Alright.

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:29.560
We gotta move on, guys.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:30.560
She wins.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.160
We're an hour and a half into part A, and we're not even done yet.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:34.200
But we haven't talked about my cat enough yet.

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.480
I'm sorry, I really want a cat, y'all.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.240
I'm getting to that point, I think it's time for me to be a daddy.

01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:42.640
Like Rob needs to be a daddy.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:43.640
What?

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.640
You're in luck.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.640
Because I have a cat for you.

01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.320
No, I don't want your cat.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.320
No, not my cat.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.320
Screw that.

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.320
My cat.

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:51.320
My cat.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.720
I'm talking about Barney, the female cat outside.

01:32:53.720 --> 01:32:59.520
That is, she's still a wild cat, but she, and yeah, I don't know why we call her Barney,

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.880
but we, that's the name we gave her before we found out that she was a girl, and so it

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.880
just stuck.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:10.680
But she actually is very friendly and comes up to us and stuff, so I will trap her for

01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:11.680
you if you want.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:15.760
I'm not, oh great, I brought you a kitty in a box.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.120
Adopt a cat, Rob.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:20.560
Yeah, I'm not gonna do it just yet, like I think I need to move.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.120
They're so easy to take care of though.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:25.340
I know, but remember, I'm gone every weekend, you guys.

01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:26.340
Every weekend I'm gone.

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.120
So I'll go take care of your cat on the weekends.

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:29.120
You won't.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.120
Yes I will.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.120
It's too far.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:33.200
No, I go take care of Susan's cat when she goes out of town.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.200
Really?

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.200
We'll see, we'll see, guys.

01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.800
Rob, I would take care of your pussy.

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.400
Would you pet my pussy when it needed it?

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:41.400
Yes I would.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.400
Thank you.

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.400
And give it a bath.

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.920
Hi, I'd wash your meat.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.960
Would you wash my pussy on the weekend?

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:52.720
Well, I got a schedule.

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.760
Never forget how mature we are here at Orange Laundry Radio.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:58.960
Alright, a couple quick stories for you, classic game of the week coming up.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.880
Loki, what do you got for us?

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:06.040
Yes, so we were talking a little bit about Project $10 and how EA likes to find ways

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:09.160
to milk you for your precious money.

01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:13.720
Well, now they're doing it again, and this isn't something that you necessarily have

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.280
to do, but it's something you may be tempted to do.

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:26.200
Madden 11 basically logs everything that you do online, your play calling, what tendencies

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:28.880
you do, and that kind of stuff, and it builds kind of a playbook.

01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:31.440
Wait, wait, wait, you can't see your porn collection, can it?

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:32.440
No.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:34.640
It can't see your porn collection.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:41.960
And it basically builds like a playbook that kind of revolves around what you do.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:49.040
And now, if you play, I guess, enough people or whatever, other people can get that from

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:58.480
you, but you can actually purchase these reports as well so that you can kind of get the dirt

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:02.800
on the other players that you're playing against.

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:07.680
And that's kind of strange, like I don't really have another word for that.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.680
That's just...

01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:09.680
I don't know.

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.720
Well, yeah, you of course sell it, take all that information and then sell it.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:15.560
It's kind of shady, but...

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.320
It's kind of like them selling the cheats that were in the games, you know, cheats that

01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:25.760
used to be just button presses, now you have to pay $2 to unlock and type stuff.

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.900
It's just...

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.760
It's such a desperate money grab.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:35.480
I mean, seriously, you're becoming that desperate chick, EA.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.280
Nobody likes a desperate chick.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.000
Anything they can do, right?

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.080
Any place they can just get more money?

01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.000
Stop being so obvious with it, though.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.080
I mean, it wouldn't be such a big deal if you put out Madden for $30 and then did all

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:49.080
this stuff.

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.660
Because at least that way, if you don't want to participate in it, you're getting a really

01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:53.660
good deal.

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:57.320
If you do want to participate in all this crap, then you may be spending a little bit

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.720
more than you would normally.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:35:59.720
I don't know.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.360
I mean, it's just...

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.280
There's no real benefit if you don't do it, I guess.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:06.560
You know what I mean?

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:11.080
If you're going to charge me for online for used or whatever, then the real game...

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:12.080
I don't know.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:13.600
But I guess since you're...

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.280
If you buy it, you knew it really doesn't affect you anyways.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.840
But seriously, though, don't let it slide.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.840
Never forget.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.600
Alright, this is going to make you even more angry, you guys.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:30.880
Apparently there is a draft, and it's not a law yet, this is just a draft that the Federal

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:36.160
Trade Commission here in the U.S. making this draft, they're making some proposals to Washington,

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:42.040
and apparently one of them is a 5% tax on consumer electronics.

01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:46.600
Now some folks are calling this the iPad tax, but it's not just iPads, you guys.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:49.000
It really should be just iPads, though.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:00.160
iPads, iMacs, Zunes, DSs, 360s, laptops, digital cameras, I mean, basically Best Buy is fucked.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.480
A lot of things you buy there are going to have a 5% tax on it.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.040
They're just going to pass it on to the consumer.

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.800
But why are they doing this, folks?

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.800
Why?

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.960
Because it will generate $4 billion for the U.S. government, which it could then use to

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:19.280
subsidize failing media outlets like newspapers.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.280
What?

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:24.680
Okay, instead of using that $4 billion to, I don't know, put a dent in the national debt,

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.400
let's blow it on more stupid shit.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:30.000
Or hire back teachers that they had to fire this year, I mean, I realize that was more

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.120
of a state thing than a federal thing, but I mean, I can think of more better uses for

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.120
this.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.680
I mean, wasn't there just a story, not that long ago, I remember reading it, maybe it

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:45.360
wasn't on this show, but about how the iPad is reinvigorating the old school media because

01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.280
like a lot of these newspapers are coming out with editions for the iPad that they're

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:52.240
selling subscriptions to, and they're actually doing quite well.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:56.800
And magazines are doing this too, like the iPad is becoming this new reading device.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:04.720
It's kind of like, why do we need to save your archaic ass if you're not going to evolve?

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:05.720
It just doesn't make sense.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:11.840
You know, again, it hasn't passed yet, but it's a dumb idea.

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.840
I just don't like what they're using the money for.

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:16.720
I think the money could go to the more, you know, important things.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.880
Why do we have to bail out the news media?

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:25.160
I mean, they sell ads, they eat, they need to evolve and adopt to where their readers

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.160
are.

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.160
Can I get some of that money?

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:35.640
We're media, we're floundering, we haven't made a dime since this show began.

01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.040
I want four billion dollars, wah.

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.360
It's just, it's stupid.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.040
Stop bailing out companies.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.040
Seriously.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:49.100
Alright, well let's move on to a part of the show that needs no bailing out.

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:53.300
It's very popular here on The Orange Laundrao, and every week you guys come to know and love

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.300
this segment.

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.440
It is the classic game of the week.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.440
Rob?

01:38:58.440 --> 01:38:59.440
Yes.

01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:04.360
I think that everyone's going to figure out what this game is when you play the opening.

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.960
Alright so then I, well let me just say though, every week, for those that maybe have never

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:11.280
listened to Orange Laundrao's radio before, every week Dark Soccer likes to go through

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:16.700
the vault, the classic video game vault, and pick out a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:21.320
little bastards playing on the lawn, you need to go play this classic video game immediately.

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:23.320
Get off my lawn and play this game.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320
Exactly.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.140
Maybe that's what we should rename this segment, get off my lawn and play this game.

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:41.600
Here is tonight's classic game of the week.

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:45.240
Now if you don't get what that is from that, you need to seriously crawl out from under

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:51.320
the rock you've been living under, and this is mostly dialogue, but yeah the game is Metal

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:55.520
Gear Solid.

01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:00.640
And who said Barbie, whatever, anyway.

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:08.720
Metal Gear Solid, a stealth action game that was directed and written by the guy I used

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.760
to run into every year at E3, Hideo Kojima.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:21.840
It first came out in 1998 for the Playstation, and it's actually the sequel to the MSX2,

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:28.160
Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake, not the one we got over here, the actual MSX version.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.800
Wait, what in the actual hell is this video?

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:34.640
It's actually 3 hours and 20 minutes long, like people can do this on YouTube now?

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.880
That's the playthrough of the first half of the game.

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:38.120
I thought you were limited to 10 minutes.

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.120
In theory.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.120
What?

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:47.160
I love the voice acting in this, and by the way, the guy who did Snake's voice was David

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.720
Hader and he also wrote the first two X-Men movies, which is why they were good.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:59.840
And the third one, Blue, he had written the third one, it would have been good.

01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:07.000
So this is the one that brought Metal Gear up to the current generation of gamers.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:16.360
Basically he's going in and stopping a group called Foxhound, which was his old unit, has

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:27.080
to liberate some hostages and basically stop them from, well, blowing up the earth, I guess.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.080
Creating...

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.720
Man, I hate it when people try to blow up the earth.

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.760
Let's play Thermonuclear War.

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:42.120
So yeah, it has amazing voice acting, and even with the limitations of the visuals back

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:49.080
in the day, they really did a good job in covering up the things that would have been

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:54.080
harder to show, like blurring the face a little bit, smoothing a line here or there.

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.160
It really did look very good for its day.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:03.480
You could get all kinds of bonus stuff to use in the game, because it's on-site weapons

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:08.200
procurement is how it's played, like the old ones.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:14.320
You can also get infrared goggles and a cardboard box, and he smuggles his cigarettes in through

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.320
his stomach.

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.320
Does that mean that he barfs up his cigarettes as soon as he lands?

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.320
Perhaps.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.320
I don't know.

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.320
Yeah.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.680
Actually, you have to use the cigarettes to get through a couple of stages too.

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.320
I think that's funny.

01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:33.120
There are, as you can tell from listening to all the speaking in the background, lots

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:39.160
of cut scenes and conversations, the game is very dialogue-heavy.

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:44.880
But on the plus side, it's very good voice acting, why don't you turn it up a little

01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:45.880
bit?

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.520
Unfortunately, it's a little bit quiet, but here you go.

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:52.080
Oh, that's when he's about to land, so...

01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:53.560
There's no voice acting, right?

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:59.180
There's some in a second, because we're at the part where he breaks through the water,

01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:03.240
and that's the start menu of the game.

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:07.160
Well, what we can do when we get school.

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.160
I love the music of this game.

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:09.160
I actually have the soundtrack.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:12.520
I have the soundtrack to all the Metal Gear Solid games.

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:16.760
And I also pick up all the art books for Dan every year.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:24.400
At any rate, the whole first part of the game is to teach you the whole stealth part of

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.260
the game, and once you get the stealth down, you can actually go through the whole game

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:31.360
for the most part without killing people.

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.920
You get bonuses, I think, for the fewer that you kill.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:42.560
But you also have to sort of maintain a working knowledge of how the entire facility is laid

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.240
out as you go through it, because you have to run back through it part of the way.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.600
The characters that you have in this one is...

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.560
I think this is funny.

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:58.440
The character designer said that Solid Snake's physique was based off Jean-Claude Van Damme,

01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.840
but his face was based off of Christopher Walken.

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:02.840
I don't see that.

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:08.200
I think he's a little bit better looking than Christopher Walken.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:14.640
So you've got Roy Campbell, who is his former CEO, and then you have Master Miller, and

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:21.280
Mei Ling, and Naomi Hunter, and Natasha Romanenko, who is a weapons person.

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:27.560
But you also get Otacon, later on, who is named after the convention.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.560
Here's some voice acting.

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.600
The elevator in the back is the only way up.

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:31.600
Just as I expected.

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:36.440
You'll have to take the elevator to the surface, but make sure nobody sees you.

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:39.440
If you need to, contact me by codec.

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:43.560
The frequency is 140.85.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:46.440
When you want to use the codec, push the select button.

01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:49.680
When we need to contact you, the codec will be...

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680
There you go.

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.800
That's the other thing I was going to bring up.

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:57.440
This game totally breaks the fourth wall all the time.

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:05.960
First of all, when you run into one of the other hostages, he tells you about a soldier

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:11.160
that Snake ran into earlier, who ends up being Meryl, said, yeah, you can contact her on

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.160
codec.

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:13.160
Oh, I remember.

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.000
Her number is on the back of the CD case.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.440
Nice.

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:24.840
And then when you fight Psycho Mantis, who is this telepathic telekinetic type of dude,

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:30.240
he proves his psychic powers for you by telling you to put your controller on the floor, and

01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:35.120
then making the vibrate function go off to make it move.

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:40.760
And then he reads your memory card, and at the time he was reading games that Konami

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:43.480
hadn't put out yet.

01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:50.440
So if you've got Xenogears later, it says, I see you like Xenogears.

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.400
I think I even had a Japanese game on there and it recognized it.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:55.920
Go Fig.

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:59.600
So yeah, but I mean, this is like the major Konami games at the time.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:06.760
But anyway, you go through the game and you've got this ninja that follows you around.

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:14.400
And he's Gray Fox, which I think he was in the second Metal Gear game, the MSX one.

01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:19.300
So yeah, you go through the game, you get to see Metal Gear Rex, and oh yeah, you also

01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:26.240
have an informant called Deep Throat, which I thought was a kind of neat nod towards,

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:29.880
well, you know, that there was an actual Deep Throat.

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:30.880
Towards the one in the Lovelace?

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:31.880
Oh, oh, sorry.

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:32.880
No.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:33.880
The actual, yeah, no, I know.

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:34.880
Of course, I know.

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:35.880
Finally.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:36.880
Oh, yeah.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:37.880
That's right.

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:38.880
Like right before he died, right?

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:39.880
Yeah.

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:40.880
Yeah.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:41.880
You know, I think he was declassified at the time.

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:42.880
Mm hmm.

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.920
So, um, man, that, that's something else though, being able to hold a secret that long, you

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:48.920
know?

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:56.440
Um, anyway, um, you go through the game, you have an epic battle with, uh, um, Liquid Snake,

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:01.320
who is the, uh, antagonist and, uh, Solid Snake's twin.

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:06.760
And you also have two endings based on what you do during the torture sequence.

01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:09.680
One of them, Meryl, gets to live.

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:12.280
The other one, Meryl, dies.

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280
Aw.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.680
And there's my favorite question in the whole game.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:22.280
Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on the battlefield?

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:25.880
Why does love always feel like a battlefield?

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:26.880
Battlefield.

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:27.880
Battlefield.

01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:35.920
Also, um, for tie-ins, and I know I've brought up police knots before, um, uh, Meryl was

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:47.820
a character in, um, police knots, so she was included, um, and then, um, there's, uh, references

01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:51.240
to, uh, Metal Gear in police knots.

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:57.080
And actually, I think scenes from police knots that go through when, um, Otacon is talking

01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:05.200
about being a big geek, basically, he's a big Otaco, um, he pees himself too.

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.080
The first time you meet him, seriously, he backs into a corner and pisses himself.

01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.080
Hello LP joke.

01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:14.080
I know, right.

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:21.200
Um, and there's also, um, preliminary, um, artwork that was an easter egg for police

01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:25.320
knots, um, pilot disc for the 3DO, which I think didn't come out, actually.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.760
Um, so yeah, there are, there were, um, some side stories.

01:48:29.760 --> 01:48:38.120
There was, um, Metal Gear Solid Integral, um, which, um, is based off of the expanded

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:45.200
Japanese version, except, um, it had, um, a VR mode with it.

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:50.320
We got the VR missions as a separate disc, um, but it had, like, a PS, uh, you remember

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:53.280
the, um, pocket station, Rob?

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.280
I do.

01:48:54.280 --> 01:49:01.880
It had a pocket station minigame, um, you could, uh, uh, call the codec frequency and

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:06.680
get commentary from the staff, and you had a first person, first person, first person

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:07.680
mode.

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:13.440
And then after, and then there was also, um, Metal Gear Solid the Twin Snakes, which came

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.880
out on GameCube.

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:22.600
And also one that people may not be familiar with, the Bleem version, for Bleemcast, which

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:27.200
basically, it ran it through with the Dreamcast superior rendering capabilities, and it was

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.200
really nice.

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:29.200
I've got it.

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:35.920
It, I mean, I, I, I totally suggest everyone look up, um, Bleem for Dreamcast, Metal Gear

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:39.560
Solid, and then compare them side by side, it really is my thing.

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:50.200
Um, the soundtrack was amazing, it was done by, um, Rika Muranaka, and, um, uh, well actually,

01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:57.760
the ending song was done by her, and it's, um, also sung in Irish, um, for the, uh, for

01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.760
the ending.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:49:59.760
I thought it was funny.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.760
I'm gay like I should say.

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:06.240
Um, so yeah, from there we got all kinds of others, we got digital comics, we got a graphic

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:11.200
novel, and then, um, of course, there were all of the sequels.

01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:19.640
Metal Gear Solid 2 The Avengers of Raiden Running Around Naked, um, did you ever play

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:21.720
that one?

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:22.720
Which one?

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.720
The second one?

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.600
Um, a very little, very, very little.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:32.640
It was Metal Gear, it was, uh, Sons of Liberty, where Snake is in there calling himself Iroquois

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640
Pliskin.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.640
Mm-hmm.

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:38.760
You know, Pliskin also from Snake, Pliskin, yeah.

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.960
And then Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, where he is actually playing as Naked Snake, who

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:45.760
turns out to be Big Boss.

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:46.760
Spoiler!

01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:49.120
Ooh, where have you been?

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:53.800
And then, uh, Metal Gear Solid 4, uh, Guns of the Patriots.

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:58.480
And then, of course, there's Metal Gear Solid Rising, uh, coming out, which is supposed

01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:02.920
to, I think, feature Raiden, who is running around naked boy.

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.360
Good times?

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:06.640
I love her.

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:07.640
In the game.

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:08.640
What's wrong?

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:09.640
Nothing.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:17.400
I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so... cute.

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:18.800
You're just flattering me.

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.800
No, I'm serious.

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:23.600
Well, I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.

01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:24.600
Come on.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:28.080
I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake.

01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:30.480
But, uh, I'm surprised.

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.480
Yeah.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:37.960
Anyway, um, if you keep talking to her, she'll give you, like, a little parable or a little

01:51:37.960 --> 01:51:39.480
phrase, you know what I mean?

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:41.320
She's basically your fortune cookie throughout the game.

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:45.880
But if you keep calling her, she'll eventually just get mad at you, and her answer will be

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:49.720
dot, dot, dot, and she'll have this big frowny face.

01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:52.320
And then, um, there's another...

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:55.800
I think it was in, um, the second one?

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:59.480
Or was it in the first one where you're in the locker, and if you look at the picture

01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:04.240
of, like, the girl that he... and then call someone on the codec, it sounds like he's

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.240
jerking off.

01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.240
Yeah.

01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:07.240
Okay.

01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:08.240
Yeah.

01:52:08.240 --> 01:52:10.280
There's Easter eggs in this game.

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:14.280
It was like, Otacon tells him, we don't have time for that, Snake.

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.920
That was the second one.

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:18.600
He's like, we don't have time for that, Snake.

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:20.720
And he's just got the O face.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:21.720
It's funny.

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.720
So, yeah.

01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:23.720
Ew.

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:25.520
I think I know a little bit too much about the Metal Gear games.

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:26.520
You sure do.

01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:27.520
Alright, but that's alright.

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.520
So, is that it for the wrap-up?

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:30.520
That's it.

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:31.520
Alright.

01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:32.520
We gotta move on with the show.

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:33.520
Yeah, we do.

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:36.320
But that was a good... that was an epic Game of the Week there.

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.320
Epic.

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:38.920
I'm already losing my voice again.

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:42.720
Metal Gear Solid is your classic Game of the Week, and a true classic at that.

01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:43.720
Yes.

01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:46.640
So, we're gonna take a quick break so that we can rest our voices and all that fun stuff.

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:47.640
We will be back.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:48.640
We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to go.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.440
It's gonna be a long episode tonight, you guys.

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:54.160
We're gonna talk about a new game from the creator of Parappa the Rappa.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:55.880
Possible upgrades of old PS2 titles.

01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.360
Goldeneye could be making a comeback.

01:52:57.360 --> 01:53:00.420
We're gonna talk all about that in Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:01.420
Don't go anywhere, folks.

01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:10.200
We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.360
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening.

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:19.280
June the 6th of 2010, where we are doing episode number 369 of our show.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.280
69.

01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.120
E3's just around the corner.

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:25.800
Of course, we've had a lot of news and rumors and stuff about what's coming up at E3.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:30.000
Also, I think our show is taping live tonight while the MTV Movie Awards are going on, I

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.700
think is the big thing tonight.

01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:35.240
And as to who's winning right now, I don't care.

01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.920
I mean, are those awards relevant?

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:37.920
Do they actually mean anything?

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.600
Or is it just an excuse to get a bunch of celebrities together for ratings?

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.600
Uh...

01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:44.600
Yeah.

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:45.600
Yeah.

01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:46.600
That's pretty much how I feel, too.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:48.960
All right, so let's get back into some gaming news, then.

01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:53.920
Some things we care about around here, and some rapid, quick stories for you guys here

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:58.480
before we get back to some Twitter topics, which we're gonna get to in a moment, at twitter.com

01:53:58.480 --> 01:53:59.480
slash O-L-R.

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:02.320
So you probably got, like, three minutes to get in your topics if you haven't yet.

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:05.720
In the meantime, let's do some rapid-fire news.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:11.200
Well, the first of hopefully many pieces of download content for Reddit Redemption will

01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:12.200
be coming out soon.

01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:20.000
On June 22nd, Outlaws to the End will be adding some new content to the game.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.120
Six online co-op missions for two to four players.

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:33.480
And also, they're gonna have some different, I don't know, different types of missions

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480
in there.

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:38.600
Looks like one where you're escorting a raft, which is kinda cool.

01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.400
And that'd be great, because I don't know about people that have played Reddit Redemption,

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:47.040
but the gang hideouts that you can actually play during free mode, I think we've gone

01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:49.360
through all of those at least six times now.

01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.640
It's getting old fast, and we need some more things to play.

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:57.760
So that would be awesome.

01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:04.080
And of course, that is gonna be free on the 22nd.

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:08.760
Wii Party is gonna be one of the games that are gonna be showing off this year at Nintendo's

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.760
press conference.

01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:20.440
And it's gonna feature 80-plus games, including some interesting ones, remote control hide-and-seek.

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:21.440
That's kinda cool.

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:26.360
I guess the players will hide their Wii remote somewhere in the room, and the other players

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:31.240
have to search for it by the sound coming from the controller's speaker.

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:33.160
Wow.

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.440
Groundbreaking and revolutionary.

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.200
I will give them props for being somewhat unique.

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.880
Some of the other games they were talking about called Wanwan Karuta.

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:47.160
Wouldn't it be funny if, like, you hid the thing too good, and then it's too far away

01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:50.440
from the Wii to make a noise or whatever, so it gets lost forever?

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:51.440
That would be funny.

01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:53.680
Sucker, gotta buy another $40 controller.

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:59.520
Wanwan Karuta is a game where the Wii remote will make a sound, and the players will have

01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:03.960
to match the noise with an on-screen image, for example, an animal.

01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:09.480
They also have a game called Sensitive Bomb, which players will pass a single remote to

01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.080
one another without trying to jostle it too much to trigger the explosion.

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:21.000
So what you do is you pass that to another player, and then you push them.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:24.900
That's playing with power.

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:30.440
And that'll be, of course, shown at the press conference on June 15th.

01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:31.440
Some other fun stuff.

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.200
Will Reggie Fils-Aime come out and try to blow somebody up and push them and all that

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:36.200
stuff, you think?

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:42.300
He won't, because he's probably endorsing family play that's not destructive like that.

01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:45.000
I don't give a shit.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.880
There are no rules in Wii parking.

01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:54.920
Connex is apparently teaming up with Nintendo to make some Mario Kart toys, and this is

01:56:54.920 --> 01:57:01.000
supposed to be happening sometime in 2011, but that is awesome that you can make toys

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:06.820
based on Mario Kart and Connex, because, you know what, hey, if it's not Lego, it's Connex,

01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:11.440
so that would be fun.

01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:18.040
I would love to have Lego or Connex toys based on the Mario stuff.

01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:23.360
So Salacious Pop is keeping us updated in chat on the MTV Movie Awards.

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:24.960
Here's why you're glad you're not watching.

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:26.200
You ready for this?

01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:30.560
Best Female Performance, Kristen Stewart in Twilight, New Moon.

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:34.120
Best Male Performance, Robert Pattinson in Twilight, New Moon.

01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:39.480
We're clearly not the demographic for- Best Movie, The Twilight Saga, New Moon.

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:42.960
We are not the demographic for MTV anymore.

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.120
You have to understand.

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:49.380
The MTV we knew and loved is gone.

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.380
It's dead.

01:57:50.380 --> 01:57:51.920
You know what Twilight needs?

01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:52.920
Simon Belmont.

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.720
That's what Twilight needs.

01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:00.400
Hey, going on to some quick fire news and some other stuff that's coming out.

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:02.620
Rock Band Weekly updates.

01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:04.000
Deftones are coming out.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Whoop-de-doo.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.960
Grown up in Sacramento, I've heard way too much Deftones.

01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.320
Cherry Waves, Hole in the Earth, and Minerva, whoopee whoopee.

01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:15.640
Individual songs, Boys Like Girls with a Great Escape, and Crown of Thorns with Rock Ready.

01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:18.800
I will be buying none of those songs.

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:19.800
But maybe you're interested.

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.680
I too will be buying none of those songs.

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:25.340
Here's a game that might actually catch my interest.

01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:26.580
Maybe I will buy this.

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:29.360
It's a game called Hardcore Uprising.

01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.320
Hard Corps, but I think the P is silent when you say it like that.

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:36.840
Hardcore Uprising for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.040
Why am I interested in this game?

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.520
Apparently it's a spiritual successor to Contra.

01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:42.820
It plays like Contra.

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.080
It feels like Contra.

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:45.080
It's high def.

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:46.080
It's a side scroller.

01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.080
It's guns.

01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:49.760
It just doesn't have Contra in it.

01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:56.200
But the game looks awesome because it's, you know, done by Axes, I think, or not Axes.

01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:01.080
The people that did it are like BlazBlue, because it's all hand drawn stuff and looks

01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.080
awesome.

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:05.440
Well, you might remember there was a Genesis game called Contra Hard Corps.

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:09.400
This is apparently a successor to that game, but for whatever reason, they've just decided

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:10.400
not to call it Contra.

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:14.500
I guess they just didn't want people to know what this game was.

01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:15.500
So whatever.

01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:18.240
It still looks cool.

01:59:18.240 --> 01:59:19.240
There it is.

01:59:19.240 --> 01:59:20.600
Uh, who is it?

01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.600
Uh, let's see.

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:23.440
Yeah, Arc System Works apparently is doing this game.

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.440
Yes, Arc System Works.

01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:25.440
That's what I was thinking.

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:26.440
There it is.

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.840
So it will be beautifully animated.

01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.840
That's for sure.

01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:36.360
Alright, also coming out, Earthworm Jim HD.

01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:38.800
Apparently that is the big release next week.

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.680
Also some deals.

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:42.320
Worms 2 is getting a price reduction.

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:44.520
Kegel goes down to 400 points.

01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:46.320
Duke Nukem 3D is down to 400 points.

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.400
I might have to finally pick that up.

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:52.080
So yeah, lots of good deals on Xbox Live next week, and of course, Earthworm Jim, or as

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:54.080
the intro says, Earthworm Jim.

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:55.240
You know, a little burping thing.

01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:58.200
Uh, HD comes out on this Wednesday, June the 9th.

01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.200
And that's going to be awesome, because you can play four-person co-op.

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:01.720
Yeah, four-person co-op.

02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:02.720
That's right.

02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:04.160
That'll be fun.

02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:05.160
So there it is.

02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:10.160
A couple of little stories about things coming out very soon on the downloadable platforms.

02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:11.160
Dark Sakura.

02:00:11.160 --> 02:00:18.440
In other news, Sony Online Entertainment is actually releasing some information about

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:24.160
PlayStation 3 and PC MMO for DC Universe Online.

02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:27.440
But they really haven't said too much more about it.

02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:31.480
There's no real release date, but they said that both versions will come out at the same

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:32.860
time.

02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:35.920
It's likely to be in November.

02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:41.320
Which actually is what they finally came out and said.

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.400
So that's cool, I guess.

02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:47.720
I don't know how it'll play, but hey.

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:56.680
Also the voice actor, Phil Snyder, who we better know as the voice of Jiminy Cricket,

02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:03.240
said that he's working on an unannounced project called Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:17.040
And said that that's likely a sequel to the mobile phone game, Kingdom Hearts Coded.

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:22.120
Could be a redrawn, you know, an upscaled version or ported too.

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:23.120
Could be.

02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:26.080
You know, when you're going from mobile phone to PSP, you expect things are gonna be upgraded

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:27.640
quite a bit.

02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:29.880
Not really.

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:31.120
I would hope so.

02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120
Could be an iPhone title.

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:34.440
Oh, that could be too.

02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:36.680
I don't know how I feel about that.

02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:48.360
And then we've had some more Sims titles, well, domains actually being registered by

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:51.440
corporate domains.

02:01:51.440 --> 02:02:04.720
There are the Sims Medivial, or the Sims Get Medivial, so could possibly be old school

02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:12.160
jousting Sims with chamber pots and chastity belts and tight lacing and lights.

02:02:12.160 --> 02:02:16.960
What if they have it where you can design your castles and stuff like that?

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:21.520
Well, not that you can't design castles and add moats, cause hell, I was doing that in

02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:22.520
Sims 1.

02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:23.520
Well, the moats part.

02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:28.920
And they've actually got out a Ren Faire set officially through the Sims store.

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:35.400
And then Mod The Sims, which is one of the mod sites I go through, they actually did

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.000
a Medivial challenge.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.880
You know what piece of equipment they could put in a Sims Medivial game that would make

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:41.880
me buy it?

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:42.880
A guillotine.

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:43.880
With his head!

02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:50.040
Yes, and then I could literally sit in the throne, or I'm sorry, my Sim could sit in

02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.040
the throne in the house.

02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:52.040
Off with his head!

02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.240
And then you also need an Iron Maiden.

02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:55.240
Yes.

02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:56.240
Iron Maiden!

02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:57.240
Excellent!

02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:58.240
Execute them!

02:02:58.240 --> 02:02:59.240
Bogus!

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:00.240
Wow.

02:03:00.240 --> 02:03:05.240
Yes, I've seen that movie.

02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:06.240
1987 called.

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:07.240
A lot.

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:08.240
It misses you.

02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.240
Hey, I got it right.

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:14.320
Alright, never forget.

02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:16.240
I am the Duke of Ted.

02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:17.240
Never forget.

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:20.000
Dark Sakura is a frickin' nerd.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000
So?

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Nerd.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.360
That's why we love you, you nerd.

02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:25.360
So?

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:28.320
Alright, so you're just a nerdy nerd.

02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:29.320
That's all.

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:35.600
Alright, we're gonna get into a segment here on the show we like to call the Twitter Topics.

02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:37.560
But I'm missing the theme music for Twitter Topics.

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.320
Can we do Twitter Topics with no theme music?

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:40.320
Can we?

02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:41.320
I don't know.

02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:42.320
Doo doo doo doo doo.

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:43.320
I don't know.

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.320
Do we have, like, music?

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.320
Are you gonna sing the theme music?

02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:46.320
No, I'm not.

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.320
Alright.

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.320
Well, you're saved anyway.

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.320
I found it.

02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:50.320
See?

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:53.160
It's what we call stretching for time while I look for stuff for Twitter Topics.

02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:55.520
Not a lot of tweets tonight.

02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:58.320
I'm frowning with disappointment at our listeners.

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.320
Here's my frown to all of you.

02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:03.320
Alright.

02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:06.760
Let's see.

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:08.680
Lots of plugs for articles on the website.

02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:10.320
See, I got those in earlier.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:13.480
Dr. Noir sent his condolences to the Golden Girl-loving crew.

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:16.680
Yeah, I guess we didn't really talk about this enough earlier in the show, but there

02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:18.640
was a lot of celebrity death, obviously.

02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:21.680
I don't buy the whole death comes in threes things.

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:24.760
I think people just look for coincidences wherever they want to.

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.480
Um, cause didn't, like, Art Link let her die, too?

02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:29.040
And nobody cares about him, though.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.040
So, whatever.

02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:31.040
Who?

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:32.040
Well, I'm saying, you know.

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:33.040
And Gary Coleman.

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.040
Right.

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.040
Who technically does have a video game tie-in.

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.040
He was in Portal 2.

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.040
Or, Portal 2.

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:40.480
Postal 2.

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.720
Much different.

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:43.320
He still could be in Portal 2.

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:48.600
Or, importantly, he's in Avenue Q. And, um, uh...

02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:49.600
Rue McClanahan, of course.

02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:50.600
No, no, no, no.

02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:51.600
The man.

02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:52.600
Our zombie man.

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:53.600
Dennis Hopper.

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:54.600
Yeah.

02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:59.600
I put on my Facebook that Dennis Hopper was going to come back as a zombie riding a motorcycle

02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:01.600
cause, what, wasn't he an easy rider, or?

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.600
Yeah, he was.

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:03.600
He rode it, or something, didn't he?

02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:04.600
Yeah.

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:05.600
Well, that's what I mean.

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:08.600
That was his big movie and all the Romero flicks.

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:14.040
But, um, my, I think my uncle added on there that Gary Coleman would be in the sidecar.

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.640
Alright, um, Tigerclaw sends us a link.

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:19.520
He sent us a lot of links, but some of them we're actually tackling a little later in

02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:20.520
the show.

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.520
But I will use this one.

02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:25.400
I think somebody had pulled this up and wanted us to use this to see if you, maybe, I think

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:28.240
you showed this to me earlier, Dark Soccer, but I'll go ahead and read it now.

02:05:28.240 --> 02:05:33.520
Cause, um, Tigerclaw sent it in, but this is, this is straight up fucked up, you guys.

02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:35.920
This is straight up fucked up.

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:42.640
Um, Predator used Call of Duty to coerce kids into sending nude pics.

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:46.360
I don't know how appropriate the stupid newborn music came on.

02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:47.360
Here we go.

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:53.320
Um, a New Jersey man convinced four 13 and 14 year olds to send him pictures of their

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:58.320
genitals by saying that it was a membership condition of the clan he was starting in Call

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.160
of Duty World of War.

02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:04.800
Jonathan Prime is 20 years old and faces four felony counts of communication with a minor

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:06.920
for immoral purposes.

02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:12.120
He also has a previous conviction on a child porn charge related to this case in his home

02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:14.680
state.

02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:19.320
He's in jail on a $25,000 bond and all this stuff.

02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:25.600
Just, kids, don't send pictures of your penis over Xbox Live ever.

02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:30.320
And don't, he shouldn't really send pictures of your penis like anywhere.

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.360
And let me tell you why.

02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:38.480
It gets bigger until, when do you stop growing like 23 or something?

02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:44.080
I mean, just wait, wait until you're fully mature.

02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:45.280
And it's gross.

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.280
Come on.

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:47.280
That's the real reason.

02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:48.760
You don't do that.

02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:52.000
Don't send pictures of your dongle over the internet.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.560
All right.

02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:55.200
Um, let's see.

02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:58.920
Meow Frog sent us some tweets saying, first time listening to OLR live.

02:06:58.920 --> 02:06:59.920
Well, welcome.

02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:01.840
And ah, what's the chat for OLR?

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:07.480
Well, I saw Meow Frog in chat earlier, so I know they made it to chat, but it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:11.640
for anyone else who is listening and wanting to know how to join us in our chat room.

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:17.080
Um, although if you ask in the All Games chat, um, they'll probably tell you how to get over

02:07:17.080 --> 02:07:18.080
there too.

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:19.080
All right.

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:20.080
Um, let's see.

02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:24.000
Uh, what else do we have?

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
That's about it.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:30.400
Except Jay Jugo, and I hope I'm saying this right, Jay Jugo, uh, I hope it's not Hugo.

02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:34.440
Jay Jugo says, uh, the never forget segment should be added to the show.

02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:35.440
Never forget.

02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:39.440
I'm just not sure how to make that like a piece of the show.

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.440
So I don't know.

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:45.200
Uh, Loomis sends us a tweet saying, OLR, will you be going to BlizzCon, Sky?

02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:46.720
I would love to buy you a drink.

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:47.720
No homo.

02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:51.200
Oh, I forgot about that saying.

02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:52.200
Thank you.

02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:56.640
Uh, well sadly, uh, homo or no homo, I'm not going to BlizzCon because I didn't know what

02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:00.560
was justified, $150 for the tickets.

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:05.080
Um, so I didn't buy the tickets because I didn't know what I'd be paying for, except

02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:07.960
that probably there's sneak peeks in new BlizzCon games.

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:12.760
However, Dark Soccer and I are, we're thinking about just going down to Anaheim anyway, if

02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:14.280
finances will allow.

02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:16.960
We'll go down to Anaheim anyway and just go to Disneyland.

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:19.840
It'll be called, uh, USCon.

02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:20.840
Yes.

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:23.080
So you can buy us a drink there, I suppose.

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.080
No homo.

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:32.080
By, by the way, Rob, I had to, I had to describe to somebody what the difference between girly

02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:33.080
and gay was.

02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.080
Oh my gosh.

02:08:34.080 --> 02:08:35.080
And decorating.

02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:40.960
I, I don't, I, I just cannot even possibly understand.

02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:42.460
All right.

02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:43.460
That's it.

02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:44.460
That's it for tweets.

02:08:44.460 --> 02:08:45.460
We didn't get a lot of tweets tonight.

02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:47.760
Well we got, I mean, Tiger class has other stories, there are things that are coming

02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:54.320
up later, so you know, we appreciate his Google foo, but I don't want to spoil upcoming stories.

02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:56.440
All right.

02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:59.240
How about some other topics we want to talk about tonight?

02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:00.240
Loki.

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:01.240
Yes.

02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:05.640
Let's talk about how Parappa the Rapper, um, well, the creator of Parappa the Rapper is

02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:09.640
putting out a new music game for the iPhone and iPod.

02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:12.440
Um, it looks interesting, I guess.

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:19.900
It's called, uh, it looks like Winta or War is Not the Answer.

02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:23.040
And it's, um,

02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:24.560
What is it good for?

02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:26.600
What is it good for?

02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:27.600
Butter.

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:28.600
Uh, yeah.

02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:39.080
They didn't really say, uh, what exactly the game, um, is going to be like, but it's basically

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:42.540
tapping squares on the screen to time with music.

02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:48.360
So kind of looks a little bit like it could be, um, you know, similar to like Lead Beat

02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:49.520
Agents or something like that.

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.520
Well I mean, Coolin' All.

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:52.480
Is the art done by Mr. Greenblatt?

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.480
It's just squares.

02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:54.480
Yeah.

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:55.480
The art could have been done by anybody.

02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:56.480
Here's the thing.

02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.640
I get all excited when I hear it's the Parappa the Rapper dude, and then I'm like, oh, it's

02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:03.220
just like neon squares that I push with my finger.

02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:04.220
This sounds riveting.

02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:09.920
I mean, I guess if the music's cool, then it's worth checking out, but come on.

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:14.360
How about a new like actual like Parappa or Umjama Lamy type game?

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:18.960
I mean, tell me that like Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, I suppose more appropriately, would

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.800
not be like the perfect platform for a game like that.

02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:22.800
Come on.

02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:23.800
Yeah.

02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:24.800
It'd be cool.

02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:25.800
It'd be awesome.

02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:26.800
You got to believe.

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:27.800
Never going to happen.

02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:33.680
By the way, the butter, you know, that comes from cheap, cheap, cheap level.

02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:39.120
We used to just for months, Dan and I would go around going crack, crack, butter.

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:41.960
So he laughed in the other room.

02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.280
I feel happy.

02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.620
And Derek H took my question literally saying a war saved us from the Nazis and war freed

02:10:48.620 --> 02:10:49.620
the slaves.

02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:52.760
I was singing a song, I don't forget it.

02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:53.760
It's all right.

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:58.480
All right, moving on.

02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:04.640
Could Sony possibly be possibly be planning more PS2 remakes?

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.160
For example, you know, they did the God of War remakes earlier.

02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:09.560
Well, guess what?

02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:11.560
It's a survey going around again.

02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:12.560
Yep.

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:13.560
That's right.

02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:15.200
The surveys sometimes leak things that Sony are thinking.

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.200
Survey says.

02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:20.720
Oh, you didn't see that joke coming.

02:11:20.720 --> 02:11:21.720
One of the things on the survey.

02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:25.760
Well, the survey said, what titles would you like to see in a future collection?

02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:31.440
Two or more PS2 titles upgraded with similar features to God of War collection.

02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:35.120
And I like this because there's this little screen shot that shows like Shadow of the

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:41.760
Colossus, Ico, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, Yakuza, Silent Hill, like just every single

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:44.300
freaking franchise is being listed in there.

02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:48.160
But I guess it's kind of cool that they're going back and thinking about doing that.

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:49.160
But you know what?

02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:51.720
Show me Twisted Metal.

02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:53.280
You know, Metal Gear.

02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.360
You know, what's interesting about this, though, is that they're asking about what do you want

02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:02.480
to see upgraded and not just like what backwards compatibility would you like to have on your

02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:04.200
PS3?

02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:08.320
You know, I realize, yes, there's that first generation of consoles that does have it,

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.080
but most of us don't have a better console and we all figured that they would end up

02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:13.520
selling it at some point.

02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.120
But I don't know, like I feel like there's there's something missing here.

02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:22.640
Yes, I'm one of those douchebags that has the fully backwards compatible system and

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.800
doesn't play any PlayStation 2 games on it.

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:25.800
Douchebag.

02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:30.200
You want to trade PS3s because I could sort of play like Final Fantasy 12.

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.840
No.

02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:34.960
Did you ever upgrade your PS3 to lose the other OS feature?

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:35.960
Nope.

02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:36.960
You're still holding out, huh?

02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:37.960
Still holding out.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:43.040
Haven't played 3D Dot Game Heroes 2 because that would upgrade my system.

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:44.320
So I'm loading it to a friend.

02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:49.760
ToaGak in our chat room says, very eloquently, fuck PS2 remakes.

02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.720
I mean, are they necessary?

02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:54.080
I mean, maybe he's posing a good question there.

02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:55.080
Is this really necessary?

02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:56.080
No.

02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:57.900
Well, the God of War collection was pretty cool, though.

02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:02.020
I mean, HD, widescreen, sexy.

02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:03.020
Come on.

02:13:03.020 --> 02:13:04.020
It was kind of cool.

02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:05.020
Right?

02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:10.520
It'd be kind of cool if the system did that on its own, but it kind of doesn't.

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:15.080
Derek H. says, if they redo Gran Turismo 2, people will realize it has more cars and tracks

02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.000
than GT5.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Might be a good point.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.280
Maybe they don't want us to go back and play some of those old games.

02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.040
I don't know.

02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:27.320
DarkTet Suvia thinks you should be a game show host, by the way.

02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:28.320
Me?

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:29.320
Yeah.

02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:30.320
Why?

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:31.320
I don't know.

02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:32.320
Maybe he liked your survey says.

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.320
Survey says?

02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:34.320
Survey says.

02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:35.320
You should do a game show about porn.

02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.520
I could see you doing that.

02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.320
Wheel of porn.

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:41.320
Remember way back in the day?

02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:42.840
Let me give you an OLR flashback.

02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:43.840
Never forget.

02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:46.120
This is many, many, many, many, many years ago in the OLR history.

02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.440
It was probably in the first or second year of OLR.

02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:49.440
Never forget.

02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:57.440
Loki hosted a competition, and the competition was called Make Edit Get Porn.

02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:00.240
I got second place in that, didn't I?

02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:01.240
I don't remember as long as I'm good.

02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:02.240
I placed in it.

02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:03.240
I know I did.

02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:04.560
I think you and I both placed.

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:09.400
But this was where basically you would make an edit to a DDR song, because back in the

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:13.040
day you could make edits in the home version of DDR and put them in the machines.

02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:17.080
And Loki's favorite edits would receive a free gift of pornography.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.280
We did the hell edits.

02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:19.280
That's right.

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:20.960
And it was called Make Edit Get Porn.

02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.720
It was the best contest the stations ever had.

02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:25.320
I did the DXY version called Another.

02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:33.800
I think I did one to kick the can called Big Cans.

02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:35.240
I think that was it.

02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:37.640
And then there was the one with the big gap in the middle that you could run around all

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:40.360
over the arcade and then come back in time to finish it.

02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:41.360
Yes.

02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:42.360
That was fun.

02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:43.360
Good times.

02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:47.480
Yeah, so I don't know how we got from PS2 titles to make edit get porn, but there you

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:48.480
go.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:51.080
I got all that Excel saga in the hell edit contest.

02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.080
That was it.

02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:53.080
That's right.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.680
A lot of the porn was actually softcore Skidamax porn, but it was still...

02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:56.680
It was not good stuff.

02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:57.680
No, it was...

02:14:57.680 --> 02:14:59.600
Well, there was a reason why Loki was giving away...

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:00.600
The winner...

02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:01.600
Whatever happened to Dave?

02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:02.600
Whatever happened to him?

02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:03.600
He got two boxes.

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:09.520
Boxes of like 60 titles in there.

02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:10.800
Boxes of porn.

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:14.320
He took it home and we never heard from him again.

02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.320
Exactly.

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:16.320
Oh my God.

02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:17.320
Is he still alive?

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:18.320
We need to...

02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:19.320
That, that, that.

02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:22.120
Or is he still fapping right now?

02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:23.120
I don't know.

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:24.120
All right.

02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:25.120
Moving on.

02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.120
Dark Sakura.

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:27.120
What you got for us?

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:28.120
More news.

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:29.120
Yeah.

02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:30.120
More news.

02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:33.040
Although Robin Gaughan is going to have to ask you your help with the mailbag today.

02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:34.040
Dark Tetsuya is pointing out...

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:35.040
That's fine.

02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:36.040
I'll do me a mic.

02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:38.440
Dark Tetsuya is pointing out that, uh, that highlight is on the best hits that you can

02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:41.940
download at orangelaundry.com.

02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:43.640
So check it.

02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:50.280
Well, um, there is, um, something about Activision working on a golden eye title for the Wii

02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:53.640
and the DS to be released in November.

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:59.600
And it's theorized to be, um, a remake of the Nintendo 64 version that Rare put out.

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:03.440
I'm going to actually just interrupt you real quick because our stream actually just went

02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:05.640
down while you were reading the beginning of that story.

02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:06.640
Well, crap.

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:07.640
We had a little bork in the feed.

02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:08.640
I don't know what happened.

02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:09.640
It went down.

02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:11.560
But I do show we are reconnected right now.

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:15.360
It's still recording for the podcast anyway, so I apologize, but we're going to do just

02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:16.820
like a live take two.

02:16:16.820 --> 02:16:19.840
So Dark Sakura, would you start in again with that lovely story while people reconnect?

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:22.120
And here I was using my porn voice.

02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.120
Anyway.

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:24.960
Oh man, you guys missed it.

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:25.960
It was so hot.

02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:28.960
No, I'm just kidding.

02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:36.080
So, Activision is working on a James Bond game, a golden eye title, Rob.

02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:40.720
And it's supposed to be out for Wii and the DS, um, in theory released in November.

02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:46.480
Uh, one of the, uh, going rumors about it is that it will be a remake of the Nintendo

02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:51.200
64 version, which as we all know is epic, classic, the game.

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:54.120
The game made me sick.

02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.120
Sick to my stomach.

02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.840
Perfect Dark was redone recently and it was pretty, pretty awesome.

02:16:58.840 --> 02:16:59.840
That's true.

02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:07.440
Um, but, um, Activision basically let it off, um, at the point that they registered domain

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.000
names that were named after the film.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:18.000
So we might see that coming and, you know, they also did work on, um, The World Is Not

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Enough, right?

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.880
Uh, they've done the last few Bond films.

02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:28.680
They have, you know, the rights to do the games for them.

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:35.080
So, I mean, if they bring us out and if they bring us out a remade golden eye, that will

02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:36.080
be pretty hot.

02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:37.080
That's going to be fun.

02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:38.080
But you know what?

02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:39.400
I don't think it'll be as good as the original.

02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:40.400
That's just the problem.

02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:42.040
You know, nothing is really as ever good as the original.

02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.120
I don't think anything's going to accurately capture the magic of the original.

02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:52.680
Well, I beg to differ, because as I said in part A, when Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes

02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:57.680
came out on the GameCube, it was a fairly kick ass version.

02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:04.640
And don't forget the Resident Evil update, where they did Resident Evil on GameCube,

02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:05.640
and it was really hot.

02:18:05.640 --> 02:18:07.320
Alright, I'll give you that.

02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:09.400
There have been remakes done right.

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:10.400
Alright, we'll see.

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:13.640
They just have to make sure to stick with the essence of the game.

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:14.640
Alright.

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:18.800
I do want to remind folks, sometimes we can't control the downtime of the feed.

02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:22.440
There's just random hiccups, although I like this comment from SSJ100Matt.

02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:26.720
Speaking of porn, who's watching it in studio, he said right as the feed went down.

02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:28.840
Not me.

02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:29.840
It's comcastic.

02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:30.840
What can I say?

02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.320
It happens sometimes.

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:37.000
Anyhow, let's move on with a few more news stories, then we're going to get to the mailbag.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.440
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, we answer your emails live, on air.

02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:41.440
Good times.

02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:42.440
Loki.

02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:46.720
Grand Theft Horse, awesome.

02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:53.760
So apparently there's been some ratings that have leaked up from the Korean ratings board,

02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:57.720
and these are some Dreamcast titles that are going to be ported to Xbox Live Arcade.

02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:04.280
Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi, they have been submitted for ratings, and of course

02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:08.600
Sega was unable to officially comment on the ratings.

02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:15.400
But Sonic Adventure has popped up before, I guess they had some screenshots leak out

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:21.200
a little bit ago, and Crazy Taxi, I think the same thing.

02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.880
Not that I know or anything, but Sonic Adventure is most definitely real.

02:19:25.880 --> 02:19:28.400
Crazy Taxi is probably the same.

02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:33.200
I would not be surprised if these get announced at E3.

02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:36.280
Do you think there's a chance they're going to come out and say, and they're out today!

02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:37.280
Because that happens once in a while.

02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:40.120
Sonic Adventure is done, so yeah, I can see that.

02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:41.120
You can see that happening.

02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:42.120
It's been done for a while.

02:19:42.120 --> 02:19:43.120
Definitely can see that happening, huh?

02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:48.000
Same as Sonic 4, but they're taking their damn time.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.240
Well, let's move on with some more news, and then I guess I'm going to do the mailbag tonight.

02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:54.120
Dark Sakura is not feeling up to it.

02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:55.120
No, that's fine.

02:19:55.120 --> 02:19:57.120
My voice has finally decided to crap out.

02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:58.120
Alright, that's fine.

02:19:58.120 --> 02:20:02.520
But I'll talk about this, and maybe this is the perk up that Dark Sakura needs, because

02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:03.520
this will be fun.

02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:05.880
There's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:12.680
It's from Ubisoft, the makers of Let's Dance, and it's called Dance on Broadway.

02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:15.680
That's right, 20 songs from Broadway musicals.

02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.560
Dude, what's in it?

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:28.040
All That Jazz, Roxy, Cabaret, Money Money, Dream Girls, One Night Only, Luck Be a Lady,

02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:32.840
We're in the Money, Lullaby of Broadway, You Can't Stop the Beat, Good Morning Baltimore,

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:45.240
Fame, My Favorite Things, Bend and Snap, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Little Shop of Horrors, Aquarius,

02:20:45.240 --> 02:20:54.920
Let the Sun Shine In, and, and, and, and, The Time Warp, Dark Sakura's making woo-face

02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:57.920
right now, but you can't hear her.

02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:02.080
I already know how to do The Time Warp, it's just a jump to the left, and then a step to

02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:03.080
the right.

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:05.240
But this is supposed to be like Just Dance.

02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:07.640
It's pretty much a sequel to Just Dance, right?

02:21:07.640 --> 02:21:10.800
Yeah, except they're going to have Just Dance too, so.

02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:14.400
Well, it's like Guitar Hero 80s edition.

02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:20.480
It's Just Dance, super duper gay edition, and that's okay.

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.880
There's nothing wrong with that.

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:26.840
This actually reminds me that people need to stay tuned for Cage Match tonight, speaking

02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:27.840
of show tunes.

02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:29.880
Oh heavens, why is that?

02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:33.080
Speaking of show tunes, that's all.

02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:36.760
By the way, for those of you guys that have never listened live before, you should tune

02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:40.160
in, because we do some extra stuff live that we don't do on the podcast, just a little

02:21:40.160 --> 02:21:43.900
bit, nothing too much, we don't want to leave our podcasties in the dark, but there's certain

02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:48.920
things we can do live that we can't do on the podcast, like play copyright music, so,

02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:53.960
you know, and clips of extended things, so do listen live sometime.

02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:58.440
Anyhow, in the meantime, we're going to do something we can do on the podcast and live,

02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:10.160
we love to do this segment every week, it is the mailbag.

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:14.000
Next link in our chatroom says, nothing from Wicked, fail.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.800
No, I actually don't like Wicked.

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:16.800
Really?

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:17.800
Oh my gosh.

02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:20.240
Well, no, because I read the book.

02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:26.440
I can't listen to this as a musical, because the book was so dark and gorgeous.

02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:30.620
Alright, let's see the emails, because there's a lot tonight, because we kind of have a backlog

02:22:30.620 --> 02:22:34.800
from all the shows that we didn't do the past couple weeks, so I'm going to start off tonight

02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:42.000
with this one from, oh, that's a spam email that came in.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:48.600
Let's do, I don't see a name on that one, let's try this one instead.

02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:52.760
Let's do, and I'm not going to be able to get to all the emails tonight, because there's

02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:56.480
so many guys, sorry guys, Redertainment.

02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:00.640
Dear OLR, I was listening to your midweek discussion of the inclusion of a keytar in

02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:03.400
the next Rock Band game, and a thought came to my mind.

02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:07.060
If this keytar is a plastic instrument with the keys on the body instead of the neck,

02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:10.220
isn't that like playing the plastic guitar backward?

02:23:10.220 --> 02:23:14.640
I don't mean playing it left-handed, but playing the guitar turned 180 degrees with the keys

02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:15.640
on your lap?

02:23:15.640 --> 02:23:21.680
Also, it seems to me that every numbered version of Rock Band gives the gaming public another

02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:25.820
gaming-related plastic dust magnet that is incompatible with other games, but gamers

02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:28.320
feel compelled by to play the game.

02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:33.360
Rock Band gave us a guitar, Rock Band 2 gave us a complete band set, Rock Band 3 will give

02:23:33.360 --> 02:23:35.200
us a keytar.

02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:38.000
That makes me wonder, I know, hold on, we got a correction there.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:41.760
That makes me wonder what useless plastic space hog Rock Band 4 will bring us.

02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:44.200
I vote for maracas, wait.

02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:47.620
Actually, one small correction to your email, dude, I get what you're saying, but here's

02:23:47.620 --> 02:23:53.380
the thing, Rock Band, think of the name, Rock Band, it actually was the full set.

02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:57.880
Rock Band was the guitar, drum, and microphone, even in the first game.

02:23:57.880 --> 02:24:02.000
Here's where you might be getting confused, because Harmonix did originally make Guitar

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.960
Hero, which was just the guitar, but you might remember they relinquished control of that

02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:11.300
to Activision, or Activision took control back, whatever, and made Neversoft make Guitar

02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:15.520
Hero 3, and that's the year that Rock Band also came out.

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:18.720
So that might be where your confusion's coming from.

02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:23.160
Nevertheless, I get what you're saying, but I kind of forgive them, because they're not

02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:24.720
doing a new game every year.

02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.460
I mean, yes, there was Beatles, yes, there was Green Day, but it's been a little while

02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:30.140
since Rock Band 2 now.

02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:34.720
So if it's one more plastic instrument to put in my house after two years, eh, I'm okay

02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:39.240
with it, especially if they are selling this in the configuration where I only have to

02:24:39.240 --> 02:24:43.960
buy the one instrument and the game, because all my other old-ass instruments still work.

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.240
My Guitar Hero 2 guitar still works, and it's fine.

02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:51.720
So there you go.

02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:59.080
Our good buddy Rob with two B's, Rob-a-ba-ba-ba, sends us some impressions on Prince of Persia.

02:24:59.080 --> 02:25:03.520
Says, my boyfriend is a non-gamer, but he really enjoyed the Prince of Persia, The Sands

02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:04.520
of Time.

02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:05.840
I thought it was fun to watch, too.

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:10.540
The criticism that Jake Gyllenhaal was too Caucasian for the role were unfounded.

02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:14.280
That's because the other two princes in the movie were whiter.

02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:15.880
Funny.

02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:21.360
Again, another thing I'm surprised I'm not hearing a lot of comment on this week.

02:25:21.360 --> 02:25:23.120
Loki, did you happen to see the movie?

02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:24.120
No.

02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:25.880
I didn't bother either.

02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:33.040
The only movie I watched this week is not out yet, so obviously not legally.

02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:34.720
But it was a good movie!

02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:37.680
And hopefully it will come out over here at some point, but it's just not yet.

02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:42.520
Now, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Rob Wake continues, I can't put my finger on why Super Mario

02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:46.160
Galaxy 2 is so much more fun when compared to Super Mario Galaxy.

02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:51.220
I like both, but the star gathering in Super Mario Galaxy 2 does not feel like work.

02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:53.920
Some of those SMG stars were hard work.

02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.560
There doesn't seem to be as much pressure to replay levels for stars, either.

02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:01.520
I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the game, especially after hearing the Super Mario 64

02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:03.440
classic as the game of the week.

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:07.360
Tune into a future episode when one of us has actually played the damn game, but my

02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:08.560
Wii's just not hooked up right now.

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:11.640
My Wii's semi-bricked from New Super Mario Brothers.

02:26:11.640 --> 02:26:14.200
Blur and these other games that play it.

02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:15.520
Really, your Wii got bricked?

02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:16.520
Semi-bricked.

02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:17.520
What's that mean?

02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:21.640
Semi-bricked is when you play a game of a different region on your system, and what

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:27.760
happens is a second update gets put in there, and so now I can play games on it, but I can't

02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.040
go into the system menu and change settings, so I have to fix it.

02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:36.960
I've just been so lazy to fix it, I just, I really don't care, to be honest.

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:42.840
It's just, I've been too busy playing other games and to actually go and play, you know,

02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:48.200
New Super Mario Brothers or Super Mario Galaxy 2, it's just, I just don't feel compelled

02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:52.100
to do so, even if it's super awesome.

02:26:52.100 --> 02:26:55.000
It's just, I don't know.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.880
Although my trait other end looks pretty nice.

02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:01.440
I watched a new video of that this weekend, it looks pretty cool.

02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:03.920
It's just getting to be a busy time of year, especially with it's summer and all, it's

02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:04.920
only going to get worse.

02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:05.920
It is.

02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:06.920
It's only going to get worse.

02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:11.840
And like, you know, as far as games coming out, man, as far as what I'm planning on getting,

02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:14.200
pretty much just cracked down to this summer and that's it.

02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:17.160
I mean, there's going to be a few months where I'm not really playing anything new, which

02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:21.220
is fine because I have tons of other stuff to play, but it's just, I don't really want

02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:24.960
to get anything that I don't think I'm going to play.

02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:25.960
Metroid Other M?

02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:30.040
Uh, well I guess Metroid Other M, but I mean, that's like at the very end of the summer.

02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:33.040
And actually, you know, I might not get it right away because, you know, Kid will be

02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:34.040
born right then, so.

02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:35.040
Oh yeah, that's true.

02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:36.040
We'll have time.

02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:40.120
Im2good in our chat room, I like that nickname by the way, Im2good says, Prince of Persia

02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:44.400
is an average movie, but that means it's like the moon landing for video game movies.

02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:50.400
One small step for man, one giant leap for video game movies to not be a turd of shit.

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:54.160
I like the turd is now a measurement of shit, as opposed to just being another name.

02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:55.160
Alright.

02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:56.760
I thought it was the Keurig.

02:27:56.760 --> 02:27:57.760
Forget it.

02:27:57.760 --> 02:27:59.960
Moving on.

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:03.400
Another email from Rob Babula that I want to bring up here, he's suggesting that we

02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:06.200
should play the 3-6-9 music from Schoolhouse Rock for the show.

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:08.480
I'm sorry, I didn't have it queued up, my bad.

02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:10.920
But I do want to address this other point in the email.

02:28:10.920 --> 02:28:16.120
Also, two weeks ago, I saw my first Tron-a-rail in Disney World, that's just what we called

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:19.240
it, but it turned out to be the official name for the decorated trains.

02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:20.920
Any sightings in Disneyland?

02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:25.640
I don't believe they've redone the monorail as Tron, I don't think they're planning to

02:28:25.640 --> 02:28:29.520
do that, but you never know, when it gets a little closer to the movie releases.

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:33.620
There was a rumor that the people mover with Tron was going to come back, but I'm not holding

02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:37.200
my breath on that, I think if it does, it ain't happening this year.

02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:39.040
But no, nothing in Disneyland yet.

02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:43.040
So we're all waiting on pins and needles that hopefully the people mover will reopen.

02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:47.160
And also of note, not to turn this into a Disney podcast, but in about what, one more

02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:48.160
month?

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:54.760
Star Tours will close, and Star Tours is no longer going to be there in its current form.

02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:55.760
They're redoing it for...

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:58.720
There's going to be a Star Wars 2.0 that comes out later.

02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:02.640
And they're going to make it all stupid in the prequels, so whatever.

02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:06.680
If it's the pod race, I'm okay with that, because the pod race, that's the rumor that

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:10.140
it's a pod race right now, and that might be kind of cool.

02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:13.960
And hopefully you get to run over Jar Jar Binks, that would be amazing.

02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:16.720
And if Greg Proops is still one of the commentators, that's also amazing.

02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:18.720
That would be awesome.

02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:21.640
Oh, that's right, yeah, he was a commentator.

02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:22.640
He was one of the two heads.

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:23.640
I remember that.

02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:29.600
No, it'd be funny though, like Robot Chicken and stuff, where they have all the Jar Jar

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:35.960
Binks stuff, they should just make it look like it's going to be some sort of pod race,

02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:40.160
lock the doors, and then it's just all Jar Jar Binks talking to you for a good like five

02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:41.160
minutes.

02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:44.440
Oh god, children would cry and run screaming away.

02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:48.040
I would complain that my day was not magical.

02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:49.040
I was not magical.

02:29:49.040 --> 02:29:51.840
I am not having a magical day now.

02:29:51.840 --> 02:29:54.760
Alright, moving on.

02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:58.520
This comes from Shook.

02:29:58.520 --> 02:29:59.520
Big S, Big K.

02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:01.160
Hi, OLR.

02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:02.880
I'm here for a rant.

02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:05.480
Lately in zombie discussions or something similar.

02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:08.960
People act like they know everything about shotguns and.44s, etc.

02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:12.460
When really they're from a big city and have been nowhere near a gun except maybe in their

02:30:12.460 --> 02:30:13.460
little gang.

02:30:13.460 --> 02:30:17.240
I'm not trying to sound like some country bumpkin, but it really pisses me off when

02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:18.480
they act like know-it-alls.

02:30:18.480 --> 02:30:19.480
What are your thoughts?

02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:20.480
Well...

02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:23.600
Don't make me bust out my Glock.

02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:27.600
I don't think anyone like really wants to shoot somebody in the face.

02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:32.720
Like in Red Dead Redemption, it's just like funny to see, does that make sense?

02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:37.280
I am an adult, I understand what is fiction and what is real, I'm not gonna go shoot someone

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:40.000
in the face if it's gonna kill them.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.600
And I will be the first to admit, I don't know the difference between all these different

02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:46.680
types of guns because I don't like guns and I would never own a gun.

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:47.680
Wait, what guns?

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:48.680
What are we talking about guns?

02:30:48.680 --> 02:30:49.680
Shotguns and.44s, etc.

02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:51.880
They're just saying I know everything about these guns.

02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:53.600
Not me specifically, but just people.

02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:54.800
You know how I learned a lot about...

02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:57.000
I can't wait until I own a gun.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.040
You know how I learned a lot about guns from playing Airsoft.

02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:03.800
Because a lot of the guns that they have out there are modeled in...

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:09.840
Now I can say, hey, that's an MP7, oh hey, that's a G36.

02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:11.280
So it's kind of cool.

02:31:11.280 --> 02:31:16.720
You know how I learned about guns very well?

02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:17.720
Writing G.I.

02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:19.640
Joe fan fiction about ten years ago.

02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:20.720
I'm not joking.

02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:22.120
This is a human.

02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:24.080
Ten years ago, I was writing G.I.

02:31:24.080 --> 02:31:25.960
Joe fan fiction.

02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:27.420
And I did my research.

02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:34.400
I have no interest in firing a gun that is not of the laser variety or the shooting range.

02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:36.960
I do still want a Hello Kitty assault rifle.

02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:38.440
We should go out to the shooting range.

02:31:38.440 --> 02:31:39.440
I wanna go.

02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:41.480
My friend used to go down there.

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:43.520
I was gonna go with him, but he moved too soon.

02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:45.040
I'll have to take a picture of this.

02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:46.040
Santa Cruz.

02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:48.380
Dan got to shoot off a.50 caliber.

02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:52.000
One more, you guys, from dragonboy69.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.880
I was wondering if any of you might know why some games, specifically Vagrant Story and

02:31:55.880 --> 02:32:00.600
Breath of Fire 3, show up on the Japan and European PSN store, but not on the North American

02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:01.600
store.

02:32:01.600 --> 02:32:02.600
Thanks for any help you can provide.

02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:03.600
Keep up the great work.

02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:07.760
Because Vagrant Story sucked?

02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:08.760
But here's the thing.

02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:10.120
Just sometimes it's a rights issue.

02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:12.520
And Final Fantasy 9, I think, is another big one, right?

02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:16.480
It's showing up in other stores, but not the current one.

02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:20.240
It's rights issues and sometimes timing and other things.

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:21.920
It's sometimes kind of complicated.

02:32:21.920 --> 02:32:25.460
I think it has to do with the fact that sometimes different companies publish different games

02:32:25.460 --> 02:32:28.160
in different countries, and that sometimes complicates things.

02:32:28.160 --> 02:32:30.320
But I think Wikipedia keeps a pretty good list of what's available.

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:31.320
Time localization, too.

02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:32.320
Yeah, it's true, too.

02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:40.000
I'm posting this picture up on the site of my Hello Kitty holding a.50 caliber shell.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:45.720
And also, too, it's sometimes just the ability for that company to be able to distribute

02:32:45.720 --> 02:32:47.480
the game in a timely manner.

02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:53.880
For example, Morph-X, which was a game that came out in Europe just recently, is actually

02:32:53.880 --> 02:32:57.920
region coded for both Europe and the North American regions.

02:32:57.920 --> 02:33:02.280
So in theory, you could actually release the game here, and it would be just fine.

02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:06.660
But for whatever reason, it may have not passed the ratings board yet.

02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:11.280
Maybe they don't have enough manpower to actually duplicate the units that they need.

02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:19.480
Because some of these companies, like Graffiti Entertainment or Zoo Games and stuff, their

02:33:19.480 --> 02:33:25.280
titles go for sometimes years if delays before they're actually released.

02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:26.280
It's ridiculous.

02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:27.280
Graffiti Entertainment.

02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:30.200
That's going to do it for our mailbag.

02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:31.720
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:33.720
If you'd like to send us an email, please do.

02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:36.160
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:40.560
After the mailbag is usually the section of the show where we get a little irritated,

02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:44.160
and we do a little segment on the show called the FUs of the Week.

02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:45.160
Why?

02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:46.160
Because we can.

02:33:46.160 --> 02:34:05.840
And if you need a little inspiration, we have an inspiration for your FU story tonight.

02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:10.440
It's about a Virginia man named Bruce Jamar Walston.

02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:15.200
Apparently authorities were called to his apartment by the girlfriend, because apparently

02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:20.800
a couple nights ago, the woman called 911.

02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:22.280
You're not going to like this, folks.

02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:24.640
You're really not going to like this, okay?

02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:28.520
And this really doesn't have anything to do with video games, but it does, because it's

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:30.480
making the rounds on video game blogs.

02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:33.320
But you're not going to like it.

02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:36.400
You're really not going to like this, okay?

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:42.720
Apparently the guy here that was arrested, Bruce Walston, was angered that the video

02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:48.440
game he was playing was disconnected by his girlfriend's new kitten.

02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:50.960
So he picked up the animal.

02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:56.400
I'm not going to say what happened, but the animal died.

02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:04.600
And this all occurred, wait for it, wait for it, in front of the woman's children.

02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:08.780
He's being held without bond at the Middle River Regional Jarrell in Verona, in case

02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:11.400
you want to send him your cards and letters.

02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:14.640
For killing a kitten for unplugging the video game console.

02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:18.360
Not only did he kill the cat, he did it in front of the children.

02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:19.360
Way to go!

02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:20.360
Psychopath.

02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:21.360
You ass!

02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:22.360
God.

02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:25.160
That's mental problems.

02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:26.160
You know what, though?

02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:27.480
Can I side rant?

02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:31.600
I realize, you know, I'm out of order here, but can I just side rant here?

02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:35.680
I really hate it when video game blogs kind of run with these stories, and maybe I hate

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:40.440
myself for bringing this up, or bringing it up in this context of this guy is an asshole.

02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:44.800
But like, this really has nothing to do with video games, and it just gives video gamers

02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:46.220
a bad name.

02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:50.960
This guy is a parasite of society, end of story.

02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:55.460
He needs to be shot out of a cannon into a land far, far away, where we will never see

02:35:55.460 --> 02:35:57.480
or hear from him again.

02:35:57.480 --> 02:35:58.480
That's really it.

02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:03.520
I mean, why would you throw a kitten against the, I almost said what happened there, and

02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:07.680
I said I would not, because it would happen to the cat, but why would you kill a cat in

02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:09.360
front of the children?

02:36:09.360 --> 02:36:11.480
That is just effed up beyond belief.

02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:13.640
Oh my god, this guy's picture?

02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:18.560
I know, he just looks like a winner, doesn't he?

02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:19.560
I know.

02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:20.560
I know.

02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:22.120
What a piece of shit.

02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:24.680
Alright, so anyway.

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:25.680
Who would like to start?

02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:26.680
Good without Bond.

02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:28.200
Would you like to start off with the FUs of the week, Darcy?

02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:29.800
Do you have some inspiration now?

02:36:29.800 --> 02:36:30.800
I'm disgusted.

02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:34.280
I know, it's disgusting, I thought you wouldn't like it.

02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:36.280
My turn up.

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:37.280
What?

02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:43.680
Dan said it's better he didn't kill the kid, it's better than him.

02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:46.840
Dan is yelling from the living room, Jamie would be less mad if the guy had killed the

02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:47.840
kid.

02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:48.840
Whatever.

02:36:48.840 --> 02:36:52.760
It's still messed up, no matter what, it's messed up.

02:36:52.760 --> 02:36:53.760
Alright.

02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:54.760
I'm gonna make mine quick.

02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:55.760
Yes.

02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:00.640
My first FU goes towards losing my voice and a little bit of cough I have left.

02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:11.160
My next one is a humongous FU to Helen Thomas, who is one of the senior White House press

02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:19.040
corps members who basically went on record saying that Jews should get out of Palestine

02:37:19.040 --> 02:37:21.360
and go back to Germany or Poland.

02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:22.360
Yeah.

02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:28.000
She didn't say go back to Jew land.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:35.360
Well, it's, first of all, telling people to go back to places that, you know, they basically

02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:43.120
left due to, how about being murdered, you know, to go back to their homeland is just

02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:44.120
really insensitive.

02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:47.960
Maybe Helen Thomas should go back to her homeland, because I don't think she's Native American,

02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:52.640
so um, boat's coming, get on it, bye.

02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:58.440
It's just really, really, and you know, the only reason, she did apologize for it, but

02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:03.200
the only reason I think she apologized for it is because they called her on it, and now

02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:09.080
they're calling for her resignation, or her to get sacked, and honestly, I agree.

02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:15.840
Now if she had her own personal private blog and said this as herself with a these views

02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:22.640
do not reflect White House blah, blah, blah, fine, insensitive, shitty as hell, you're

02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:27.640
still a bitch, but, but this is America.

02:38:27.640 --> 02:38:28.640
We do.

02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:31.020
She has the right to be a bitch and we have the right to call her a bitch.

02:38:31.020 --> 02:38:36.960
That's a free speech is all about to say it in her capacity in a public forum as a representative

02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.240
of the White House press corps as a senior representative.

02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:45.200
Now tell me that's just not highly irresponsible and incredibly insensitive.

02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.560
I think she should get sacked and drawn behind a cart by her toes.

02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:53.760
I want to see Obama just punch her on the White House lawn, that'd be amazing.

02:38:53.760 --> 02:39:01.480
She's a good bitch, but yeah, and that's not that I'm advocating violence, but in special

02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:02.480
circumstances it's okay.

02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:08.320
And you know what, it's funny because her apology is not even, she's saying that she

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:12.960
deeply regretted the comments I made last week regarding Israelis and Palestinians.

02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:17.280
They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when

02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:21.760
all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance, may that day come soon.

02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:24.760
She didn't really address what she said.

02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:25.800
Not at all.

02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:30.120
She just let out a blanket statement to appease everybody that doesn't really address the

02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:31.120
problem.

02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:34.900
She, if she was going to have any sincerity of it, she needs to say, you know what?

02:39:34.900 --> 02:39:40.360
I was wrong, sorry.

02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:41.360
Nasty woman.

02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:42.560
She looks nasty.

02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:46.080
I'm seriously, she looks like, like the picture of a hag.

02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:48.440
Alright, let's move on.

02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:49.440
Loki!

02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:56.480
Uh, F you to myself for having the obsessive compulsion to spend money on stupid things

02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:02.560
that I really don't need to spend money on, like Project Under $100, for example.

02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:08.400
Not that that's going to stop me from doing it, and also F you to the fact that I don't

02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:12.960
have any airsoft guns, because, or, and I'm also not in the airsoft gun really right now

02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:17.520
because I don't have any airsoft guns, because I really want the Magpulpty SFPG.

02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.800
The folding pocket gun looks so awesome, and it's a gun that folds out of a briefcase shape

02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:27.680
into a, like a little personal assault rifle, and that's awesome, good times, but it's also

02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:31.320
really expensive and I don't need it, at least I'm not buying that.

02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:36.720
Um, my F you of the week goes to, um, the returning side panes that I've been having,

02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:40.040
because, uh, yeah, that's why I went to the hospital a couple years ago and I really don't

02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:41.040
want to go back.

02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:44.240
Um, maybe it's Mother Nature trying to tell me I need to go on a diet again.

02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:47.120
I don't know, but I don't like being freaked out like that.

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:48.120
It sucks.

02:40:48.120 --> 02:40:50.280
I F you to my body.

02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:51.280
Wah.

02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:55.680
Alright, uh, let's move on with, uh, just a couple more news stories for you guys, then

02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:57.320
the Skype line.

02:40:57.320 --> 02:40:58.600
We'll get to the Skype line here.

02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:01.840
Uh, admittedly it's going to be a little bit shorter Skype line tonight, because, uh, we

02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:05.640
had a really long show, and we still have an afterbirth yet too before it gets too late,

02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:08.240
but, uh, we will at least take some calls here in just a little bit.

02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:10.800
In the meantime, Loki, what you got for us?

02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:17.560
Games Convention Online in Leipzig is actually going to be going, um, industry only this

02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:18.560
year.

02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:27.320
Apparently, um, I guess they had 43,000 attendees in 2009, and, um, you know, now they're just

02:41:27.320 --> 02:41:34.740
saying the number of registered public exhibitors was insufficient, and that the satisfied interest

02:41:34.740 --> 02:41:40.440
of the visitors, whose past experiences bring them with high expectations to Leipzig, um,

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:46.680
it doesn't make sense why they're going to cut it, but they're planning on, um, I guess,

02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:52.640
um, having 30 companies attending this year, which is already bigger than last year, but,

02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:55.440
um, it will not be open to the public.

02:41:55.440 --> 02:42:00.600
So it's basically, this show's got too many common folk at it, so, uh, in order for our

02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:01.600
show to get bigger-

02:42:01.600 --> 02:42:02.600
For business to happen.

02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:03.920
It's basically what E3 did.

02:42:03.920 --> 02:42:04.920
Yeah.

02:42:04.920 --> 02:42:10.560
But, I mean, this is a good, maybe a good example of why we don't have E3 open to the

02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:14.520
public, because it would be a nut house.

02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:17.120
Alright.

02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:21.120
Let's move on with one more story here, and this is more of a wrap-up here.

02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:25.400
There's, um, actually some things going around out there that show what some of the confirmed

02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.640
games that are going to be shown at E3 are.

02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:30.280
Let me run down some of the, uh, companies here and some of the games that they're going

02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:31.280
to be showing.

02:42:31.280 --> 02:42:34.160
2K Games is going to be showing Mafia 2.

02:42:34.160 --> 02:42:39.360
And keep in mind, this is only announced stuff, because there's always surprises, always,

02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:40.960
always, always surprises at E3.

02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:45.200
So don't take this as, like, the definitive list of the only things being shown at E3.

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:47.600
This is just what is confirmed thus far.

02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:54.000
2K Games is showing Mafia 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V, Spec Ops The Line, and XCOM.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.440
I didn't even know they were remaking XCOM, right?

02:42:56.440 --> 02:43:01.060
Yeah, it's supposed to be not so much like, it's more like a first-person shooter now.

02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:04.640
I might remember hearing it on a previous show or something, but this is the first time

02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:07.880
I remember hearing it, um, right now, so.

02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:13.440
Uh, let's see, Activision has Call of Duty Black Ops and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock,

02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:16.560
and supposedly that's it, I somehow doubt that.

02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:22.680
Bethesda's bringing Brink, Fallout New Vegas, Hunted the Demons Forge, and Rage.

02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:28.120
Capcom 2 has Dead Rising 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and an untitled sequel.

02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:32.400
Uh, let's see, and that's, I'm ignoring the mobile stuff.

02:43:32.400 --> 02:43:37.640
Disney Interactive Studios has Epic Mickey, Guilty Party, Pirates, are they really gonna

02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:38.960
call that game Epic Mickey?

02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:40.600
I think that's a stupid title.

02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:42.400
Maybe it's just the working title right now.

02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:46.640
God, I hope it is, cause that's a, let me go on record saying that is a stupid name

02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:48.280
for a video game.

02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:53.760
Pirates of the Caribbean Armada of the Damned, Toy Story 3, Tron Evolution, and Tron Legacy.

02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:55.640
Hey, I'm all about checking out the Tron.

02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:56.640
Those are supposed to be cool.

02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.280
I wanna see what that looks like, that's gonna be awesome.

02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:06.320
Uh, EA is showing APB, Bulletstorm, Crysis 2, Dead Space 2, EA Sports Active 2.0, FIFA

02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:13.000
Soccer 11, Madden NFL 11, Medal of Honor, NBA Jam, NCAA Football 11, NHL 11, Tiger Woods

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.320
PGA Tour 11, lots and lots of sporty games.

02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:23.080
Hudson Soft, Beyblade, Metal Fusion, Bomberman Live, Battlefest, Bonk, Brink of Extinction,

02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:28.920
Deca Sports 3, Lost in Shadow, and Oops! Prank Party on the Wii.

02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.280
Oops, I crapped my pants party.

02:44:33.280 --> 02:44:35.880
Oh my god, Oops! Prank Party.

02:44:35.880 --> 02:44:41.840
Konami has Castlevania Puzzle, Angkor of the Night, Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Def Jam

02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:49.880

02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:57.720
2010, Rocket Knight, Russian Attack Ex-Patriot Saw 2, and the Cages Pro Style Batting Practice.

02:44:57.720 --> 02:45:01.640
As I said earlier in the show, notice no DDR in that list.

02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:03.000
Could DDR be dead?

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.200
Nope, I will tell you what they're probably gonna do.

02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:07.200
Surprise announcement?

02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:11.160
They're gonna make an announcement that's gonna support N-Tall.

02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:12.160
You think?

02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:13.720
Yeah, I have a feeling.

02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:15.000
Alright, we'll see what happens.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.400
Because you know, Konami, they like doing gimmicky shit that doesn't make any sense

02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:20.120
for the franchise whatsoever.

02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:25.280
For example, what they were showing off at last E3 with Dance Dance Revolution, playing

02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:29.880
Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii Fit balance board using your ass.

02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.800
That made no fucking sense.

02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:37.320
Do you guys want some video at E3 of me playing Def Jam Rap Star?

02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:39.960
You know who I want to see video playing that?

02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:40.960
What?

02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:41.960
Irene.

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:45.120
Ah, I wish she could go to E3 this year.

02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:46.120
Good times.

02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:47.960
My heart, Irene.

02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:52.600
LucasArts is bringing Lego Star Wars 3, Monkey Island 2 Special Edition, The Force Unleashed

02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:54.680
2, and Star Wars The Old Republic.

02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:55.800
Lots of stuff there.

02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:01.680
Majesco is bringing Crafting Mama, Greg Hastings, Paintball 2, Swords, and Zumba Fitness.

02:46:01.680 --> 02:46:02.680
Microsoft.

02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:04.800
No Babysitting Mama?

02:46:04.800 --> 02:46:05.800
Apparently not.

02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:06.800
Disappointment.

02:46:06.800 --> 02:46:12.040
Uh, let's see, Microsoft is bringing Fable 3, Gears of War 3, Halo Reach, and Project

02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:13.680

02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:19.640

02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:27.840
Splatterhouse.

02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:34.000
Natsume is bringing Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar, and Lufia, Curse of the Sinistrals.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Yes?

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.280
Dude, I remember Lufia.

02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:37.760
It's coming back.

02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:39.480
It's I think a remake of the old games.

02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:40.660
I think I have Lufia.

02:46:40.660 --> 02:46:43.280
It's coming back.

02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:48.520
Tokyo's bringing Metroid Other M, The Legend of Zelda Wii, Wii Vitality Sensor Games, and

02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:50.080
all their 3DS games.

02:46:50.080 --> 02:46:52.640
No mention of Pokemon Black and White yet, which is interesting.

02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:55.480
I would thought that that would be out on the floor, but maybe they're just not ready.

02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:59.440
Maybe that'll be a Tokyo game show, I don't know.

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:01.360
Sega's got Conduit 2.

02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:03.200
I didn't know they were making a Conduit 2.

02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:04.200
Yeah.

02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:05.200
Nice.

SNK is bringing The King of Fighters XIII.

Ooh, The Last Guardian.

02:47:36.880 --> 02:47:38.880
That was that epic trailer last year, huh?

02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:39.880
Yeah, it was.

02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:40.880
I remember.

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:41.880
I want to see that.

02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:44.560
Sounds awesome.

02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:45.560
Let's see what else we got.

02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:51.480

Kane and Lynch 2, Dog Days, and Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.

02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:58.680
I know that sounds kind of weird that that's at the Squeenix booth, but there's that whole

02:47:58.680 --> 02:47:59.960
merger now.

02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:02.280
That's how it works.

02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:03.560
We got a few more for you guys.

02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:09.480
THQ is going to be showing DaBlob, The Underground, Homefront, Red Faction 4, Saints Row 3, The

Harry Potter Years 1-4, Lord of the Rings Aragon's Quest, Lord of the Rings War in the

North, and last but not least, Super Scribblenauts.

02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:00.160
Now with the verbs.

02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:02.000
There it is, a list of what is being shown at E3.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:05.680
Sounds like it's going to be a fun year, isn't it?

02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:10.320
I'm excited, I'm sorry, that's what I meant, adjectives, not verbs, don't you have all

02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.880
of it though it seems like?

02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:12.880
No.

02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:15.880
It'd be hard to spawn a verb.

02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:17.880
Spawn run.

02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:24.760
Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we're going to get to some last minute

02:49:24.760 --> 02:49:28.640
stories because, well actually I take that back, we already have calls coming in, let's

02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:34.120
go to the Skype line, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:36.880
we're going to go to the Skype line right now, we've already got calls coming in, hi,

02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:39.880
you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:40.880
It's Ray Iyanami.

02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:44.520
Hey, Ray Iyanami, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:47.400
I've been bad from Fanime for about a week now.

02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:52.500
Fanime was over Memorial Day weekend, sadly I was not there, I was in Portland, but how

02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:55.840
was Fanime this year?

02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:02.800
Pretty fun, it seems to get better every year, and there's a few crappy parts, but it doesn't

02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:06.200
detract from the experience as a whole usually.

02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:10.080
Well first things first, I've got to ask, since it is a video game show, how is the

02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:11.720
game room at Fanime?

02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:17.960
Okay, I can't take it back, so, gaming room for arcades, they had, like the usual stuff

02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:23.840
from last year, but this time they have a few new things like Mushihime-sama and Digimax-Technica,

02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:28.760
I was the special side to see Technica, even if they have the Platinum Crew servers, but

02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:31.600
I expected it not to be there anyway.

02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:35.320
Did they wheel that all over from SVGL or something?

02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:40.320
Actually no, from what I've heard, like some years ago, there was some fallout between

02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:47.720
Fanime and Golf Land, so now Fanime gets their machines from University arcades, like, someone

02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:49.640
from San Jose State and UCLA.

02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:50.640
Oh, okay.

02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:51.640
Gotcha.

02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:55.120
So we ended up getting UCLA's machine.

02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:57.360
Hmm, interesting.

02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:00.520
Well that's cool, it sounds like game room was fun.

02:51:00.520 --> 02:51:03.680
Most of the game room was a bit of a letdown this year, mainly because there weren't as

02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:09.600
many TVs, like, the concentration of people playing fighting games and people playing

02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:14.520
other games like Class D, Jameson's Smokes and such was really high this year, like,

02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:22.160
like you pick a random TV, like 4-5 times, it's probably going to be Brawl or something

02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:28.080
else like, or Rock Band or something, or like something I say pretty much every damn con

02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:31.220
gaming room.

02:51:31.220 --> 02:51:32.220
What about some cosplay?

02:51:32.220 --> 02:51:33.840
Was there any good gaming cosplay?

02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:37.280
I know DarkSakuro showed me a picture earlier, I don't think it was from Fanime, but some

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:38.680
Metal Gear cosplay.

02:51:38.680 --> 02:51:41.520
Was there any good gaming cosplay you saw?

02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:43.680
Umm, yeah.

02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:46.480
Well, like what?

02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:50.680
I saw a picture of a Vanille from Final Fantasy XIII that looked really cute, I thought she

02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:51.680
did a good job.

02:51:51.680 --> 02:51:52.680
What'd you see?

02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:56.360
I saw a lot of Touhou cosplay, though that's mainly because I went to the Touhou Gathering

02:51:56.360 --> 02:52:02.440
and the explosion of, like, Touhou related events on Sunday, I was sad to not see any

02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:04.560
Bimani cosplay like usual.

02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:08.360
Well, I hate to tell you, but Bimani's kind of fading out.

02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:09.360
Yeah, I know.

02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:14.960
It's just like, I saw a few 2DX cosplayers at SoccerCon, which I didn't get pictures

02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:19.200
of much from my Chagrin, or Chagrin, however I'll pronounce that.

02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:22.240
I'm looking at some of your pictures, it looks like there was a Pac-Man there I'm looking

02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:27.700
at and I'm looking at a Black Mage and a Sackboy, Loki's Sackboy costume is better though.

02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:30.680
I saw some BlazBlue cosplay like Hazama and Lychee.

02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:32.320
Oh, that's cool.

02:52:32.320 --> 02:52:36.760
I saw a couple Captain Falcons, which is one of the alternate palettes from Super Smash

02:52:36.760 --> 02:52:37.760
Brothers, interestingly.

02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:45.820
There's also the guy that does British cosplay every year, so glad to see him every year.

02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:48.800
Now what's this about, there were some protesters?

02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:50.600
Were people protesting Faname?

02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:51.600
What's up with this?

02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:57.320
Uh, they weren't protesting Faname per se, it's basically, you know about those fire

02:52:57.320 --> 02:53:03.120
and brimstone preachers that go turn or burn and such like that?

02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:07.160
Oh yeah, yeah, you always see them out, like even when I was in Portland there was one

02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:12.780
out at the fair, they do like a cute little fair downtown where a lot of local vendors

02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:16.820
come out and sell their local goods and there was some guy standing there on the street

02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:22.160
corner spouting their whole thing about, you know, everybody's going to hell, and that

02:53:22.160 --> 02:53:23.160
whole thing.

02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:24.960
So Faname got a little bit of that?

02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:25.960
Yeah.

02:53:25.960 --> 02:53:27.960
Good times.

02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:38.200
Oh, I came across a Guitar Freaks V4 machine with EMU slots, but it's not connected to

02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:39.200
EMUs.

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:40.200
Interesting.

02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:43.840
Did you actually play some of the Guitar Freaks?

02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:47.680
No, I don't really play Guitar Freaks or Drummania.

02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:50.920
I'm more of a 2DX person and a DJ Maxx person.

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:52.920
Did they have 2DX?

02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:58.400
Um, yeah they did, but interestingly it was a hacked version of 2DX Empress with DJ Maxx

02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:00.560
crossovers and other things on it.

02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:01.560
Huh.

02:54:01.560 --> 02:54:05.160
I didn't play it because the screen was laggy and laggy screens make me rage quit.

02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:11.360
Wait, wait, wait, there was, there was Technica, I'm sorry, DJ Maxx crossovers in this game?

02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:12.360
How was that?

02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:13.360
Is it a hack?

02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:19.320
Yeah, someone has some DJ Maxx songs into 2DX, which is very interesting.

02:54:19.320 --> 02:54:22.800
I've seen a video of it on YouTube before.

02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:26.240
Hmm, interesting.

02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:30.240
Well I didn't even know something like that existed, but that's cool.

02:54:30.240 --> 02:54:36.160
Well any other thoughts on Faname you want to tell us before we let you go?

02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:40.160
I think what Faname could do next year for the console gaming is maybe have one section

02:54:40.160 --> 02:54:46.080
where it's like no fighting games or anything like that, like classic games and shooters

02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:51.720
and other things that don't require you to kick ass and have fun.

02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:54.680
I'm all about a classic game room like they have at PAX.

02:54:54.680 --> 02:54:55.680
Good stuff.

02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:59.960
Yeah, they had one at SoccerCon, they had a retro gaming room where it was mostly like

02:54:59.960 --> 02:55:06.320
stuff, like N64 era stuff and earlier.

02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:07.320
Very cool.

02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:08.920
Well hopefully we'll be able to make it out next year.

02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:11.680
I know we skipped this year, but maybe we'll be back.

02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:15.880
I haven't seen you guys since 2007, so I'm getting worried if I'll ever see you at Faname

02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:16.880
again.

02:55:16.880 --> 02:55:17.880
Well, we'll try to make it work.

02:55:17.880 --> 02:55:18.880
When's California Xtreme?

02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:19.880
I saw you asking about that.

02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:20.880
That already happened.

02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:21.880
I'll go to Faname next year.

02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:22.880
When's California Xtreme?

02:55:22.880 --> 02:55:27.920
I think it's in July, aka next month.

02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:31.160
Maybe we'll go to that, because I've never been to California Xtreme and I'd really like

02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:32.160
to go.

02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:33.160
What do you think there, Sakura?

02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:34.160
Do it.

02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:35.160
Think we'll make that happen in July?

02:55:35.160 --> 02:55:36.160
We'll see what we can do.

02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:39.640
I'm not going to make any promises yet, but July would be a lot better than June.

02:55:39.640 --> 02:55:40.640
So maybe.

02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:45.160
Alright, well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank

02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:47.160
you so much for your call and have fun.

02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:49.160
Alright, see ya.

02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:50.160
Later.

02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:54.000
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRady if you want to give us a

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:55.000
call.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:56.480
Loki, do you have any other last minute stories for us real quick?

02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:58.960
Yeah, I got some interesting things.

02:55:58.960 --> 02:56:05.840
There's a rumor that they're going to be doing a Street Fighter versus Tekken game.

02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:06.840
That's kind of interesting.

02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:07.840
Interesting.

02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:08.840
Sounds like fun.

02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:09.840
Yes.

02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:16.840
So maybe that's going to be kind of the title they're going to announce at E3, I don't know.

02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:19.520
July 17th through 18th for California Xtreme.

02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:20.520
Let's go to the phones.

02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:21.840
Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.

02:56:21.840 --> 02:56:22.840
Who's this?

02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:24.840
Hi, this is Spazinator.

02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:28.600
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

02:56:28.600 --> 02:56:36.440
I had one question that kind of ties in very loosely to the last call that you had.

02:56:36.440 --> 02:56:37.440
Alright, but just one.

02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:38.440
No, I'm just kidding.

02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:39.440
What's up?

02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:45.920
I was kind of wondering, is there any like retro games that you would love to see either

02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:53.600
in Microsoft's game room or on PSN that's not already there or hasn't been announced?

02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:55.120
Ooh, good question.

02:56:55.120 --> 02:56:59.440
I would definitely like to see PS2 somehow able to get some of my old PS, because believe

02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:02.440
it or not, PS2 is getting to be, you know, when did the PS2 come out?

02:57:02.440 --> 02:57:03.440
About 10 years ago.

02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:05.360
So it's going to be a little bit retro.

02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:09.040
As far otherwise, I would say I would like to see a little bit more of the Commodore

02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:10.240
64 love.

02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:14.220
There's a little bit of that on the Wii, but we don't have enough of it, especially here

02:57:14.220 --> 02:57:15.220
stateside.

02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:18.660
I realize Commodore 64 was a bigger deal over in Europe, but like I would love to see stuff

02:57:18.660 --> 02:57:21.600
like Impossible Mission and so forth released over here.

02:57:21.600 --> 02:57:26.400
And I hope that my earlier inkling, that if Game Room is going to reach thousands of games,

02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:31.840
then they're going to dip into the old like Apple IIe library and the Commodore 64 library

02:57:31.840 --> 02:57:32.840
and some of that.

02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:35.880
I hope my inkling there is correct, because there's lots of Commodore 64 games I would

02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:37.080
love to see get the treatment.

02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:41.080
I mean, you guys should see some of the EA games back when they were ECA.

02:57:41.080 --> 02:57:42.800
They made some pretty epic games.

02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:46.200
Mule, M-U-L-E, was a great game on the 64.

02:57:46.200 --> 02:57:47.680
I'd love to see make a comeback.

02:57:47.680 --> 02:57:52.960
You know, there's a lot of those like classic computer games of yesteryear I would love

02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:53.960
to see.

02:57:53.960 --> 02:57:56.200
And if that happens on PSN, that would be great too.

02:57:56.200 --> 02:58:01.040
Although I sort of see the classic stuff on PSN as being more of a like Sony-based thing

02:58:01.040 --> 02:58:02.040
usually.

02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:03.560
I don't usually see a lot of old stuff.

02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:04.560
But you know what's interesting?

02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:06.120
There has been some obscure stuff.

02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:07.840
Let me give you one retro title.

02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:12.720
Digger HD is out on PlayStation Network, and it's kind of an overlooked title, but it's

02:58:12.720 --> 02:58:15.120
a remake of an old, old PC game.

02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:20.000
And what's really cool, the old PC game is in there and playable.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:25.200
It's not one of my favorite classic games and not one that necessarily necessitated

02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:31.360
the treatment it got, but I think it's an example of a retro remake done really well.

02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:34.100
And that is on PlayStation Network and not on 360.

02:58:34.100 --> 02:58:36.040
It's only on PSN, Digger HD.

02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:37.040
It's worth a look.

02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:38.040
Oh, yeah.

02:58:38.040 --> 02:58:40.040
Yeah, I got that one too.

02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:44.640
In fact, I got that two I want to see roughly about a month and a half ago.

02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:45.640
That's pretty good.

02:58:45.640 --> 02:58:46.640
Yeah.

02:58:46.640 --> 02:58:48.640
I mean, it's cute for a retro game.

02:58:48.640 --> 02:58:49.640
Yeah.

02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:50.640
Yeah.

02:58:50.640 --> 02:58:59.560
At least in terms of game room, what I would love to see is like virtually any old classic

02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:01.560
Capcom game.

02:59:01.560 --> 02:59:07.440
I mean, Capcom, before they really started going gung ho on home consoles, they've been

02:59:07.440 --> 02:59:15.320
known for their arcade titles, whether it be the 1940 series, the Street Fighter series

02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:21.360
that's pretty much a given, Ghosts and Goblins, and so on and so forth.

02:59:21.360 --> 02:59:27.600
Game room badly needs other publishers on board because right now the only game room

02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:34.040
games that are coming out are Atari, Activision, Intellivision, and Konami.

02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:35.040
That's it.

02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:38.040
I have not seen games from, at least I can think of, off the top of my head.

02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:42.040
I don't believe there are any other publisher's games showing up in game room, which is odd

02:59:42.040 --> 02:59:45.920
because they promised this thousand games thing earlier.

02:59:45.920 --> 02:59:51.060
And what's also strange to me, this week in game room, let me take a step back.

02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:57.680
Game packs like three and four in the other expansions we got were packs of 14 games split

02:59:57.680 --> 02:59:59.480
into two weeks worth of releases.

02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:01.440
In other words, they were timed release.

03:00:01.440 --> 03:00:06.040
It's like when you downloaded pack three, you got seven games one week and then seven

03:00:06.040 --> 03:00:07.040
games the next.

03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:11.680
Well, game pack five just came out and we got five games this week, which makes me think

03:00:11.680 --> 03:00:13.960
it's going to be three weeks worth now.

03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:18.920
They're stretching these game packs out longer and longer, like they are going to run out

03:00:18.920 --> 03:00:21.200
of games.

03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:25.320
My hope is that they are going to make some big announcements at E3 and that's kind of

03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:29.940
why we're waiting because right now, okay, well the three weeks for game pack five would

03:00:29.940 --> 03:00:32.440
take us right through the end of E3.

03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:34.860
There was also a delay this week.

03:00:34.860 --> 03:00:38.920
Game pack five was held up by a day and I don't know if maybe this all plays into it,

03:00:38.920 --> 03:00:43.560
but I really hope that they are coming out at E3 and saying, hey, we have these other

03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:46.000
publishers on board for game room.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:52.040
If they don't do that, game room is doomed and it's really a bummer because there's so

03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:53.840
much potential with game room.

03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:57.960
Although I fired up video pinball this week, which was one of the releases.

03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:00.960
Yeah, not what I remember when I was six.

03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:03.520
I was kind of disappointed.

03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:15.200
Yeah, in fact, I had just recently bought Super Breakouts and as Bobby Blackbroker,

03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:21.800
he had pointed out on his show, Without the Pail is kind of a pain in the arse to play

03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:28.200
that game, but still, even with that being said, you know, there's the whole nostalgia

03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:35.560
factor considering that there was, I think the first game I ever played at Syphon Blackjack

03:01:35.560 --> 03:01:42.160
on the 2600, so there's something behind that.

03:01:42.160 --> 03:01:47.020
I think a lot of people also, when they think about the old Breakout games, they're really

03:01:47.020 --> 03:01:49.520
thinking about Arkanoid.

03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:53.120
You might know the difference between the games, and I'm sure someone like Bobby certainly

03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:57.080
knows his video games and all that, but I think when a lot of us think about Breakout

03:01:57.080 --> 03:02:01.960
and the retro goodness of that game, you're really remembering Arkanoid and some of the

03:02:01.960 --> 03:02:07.640
better Breakout games that came out later on, and Tidal would be a good publisher to

03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:08.640
buddy up with too.

03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:12.280
You could get Arkanoid, Bubble Bobble, lots of good stuff.

03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:18.480
The next few weeks are really crucial for game room, and I've gone on this tangent in

03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:20.920
previous shows.

03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:24.600
I'm really worried the game room is going to be a giant disappointment, and it's almost

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:29.000
more disappointing because if it doesn't work, you're not going to see anyone else want to

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:34.640
try it, and there was such good ideas here, but I really think those chrome layoffs affected

03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:38.920
things harder than they claimed it was going to, but I hope they're at E3, because I'm

03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:39.920
going to ask some questions.

03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:40.920
I can't wait.

03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:41.920
Oh yeah.

03:02:41.920 --> 03:02:42.920
Can't wait.

03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:50.440
Yeah, I really hope that despite the layoffs, they do manage to really turn out the games

03:02:50.440 --> 03:02:57.480
for you, and they get all the support from the gaming community that they deserve, because

03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:04.360
I just hate to have to wait another generation or two for something similar to game room.

03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:05.360
Let's hope.

03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:06.360
Let's hope.

03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:08.760
Spaznator, I got to let you go, because we're going to go and wrap up the show, but thanks

03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:10.760
so much as always for your call, okay?

03:03:10.760 --> 03:03:11.760
Sure.

03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:12.880
Have a good one.

03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:13.880
You too, buddy.

03:03:13.880 --> 03:03:14.880
All right.

03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:16.680
That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:21.600
I'm sorry to close the phones, but we're kind of running long tonight because part A was

03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:23.000
really, really long tonight.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:26.320
It was almost two hours long, so unfortunately I am going to close up the Skypline so we

03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:28.880
can kind of wrap up the show, because we still have an afterword to get to and all that fun

03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:30.720
stuff, and last minute stories.

03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:34.800
We haven't let Loki finish last minute stories, but I did want to invite callers, please email

03:03:34.800 --> 03:03:35.800
us right now.

03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:37.360
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.

03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:39.600
Get your thoughts out so we can read them on next week's show.

03:03:39.600 --> 03:03:40.600
Loki.

03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:41.600
Yes.

03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:42.600
Other things.

03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:46.160
There was a game that I think we talked about a long time ago.

03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:50.740
It was a Grand Theft Auto kind of demake, I guess.

03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:55.040
They were doing like an 8-bit version of it.

03:03:55.040 --> 03:03:59.340
There's a guy working on like a ROM hack, or actually just kind of a custom game that

03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:04.240
was going to be based on, I guess, Grand Theft Auto.

03:04:04.240 --> 03:04:10.840
Well, now this game is being retitled and losing all of its Grand Theft Auto ties, but

03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:17.560
it's going to be coming out on WiiWare as Retro City Rampage, and it looks pretty awesome.

03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:23.200
They're going to have a bunch of different parodies on different things like Metal Gear,

03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:27.600
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and whatnot, Sonic, and the game itself is pretty much

03:04:27.600 --> 03:04:33.380
an open world action game, just like the old school top down Grand Theft Autos.

03:04:33.380 --> 03:04:35.360
So that's pretty sweet.

03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:36.360
Interesting.

03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:37.360
Yeah.

03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:47.840
Apparently, some of the Nintendo portables, the DSi XL, they are getting some new colors

03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:49.680
of the DSi XL.

03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:56.440
There's going to be yellow, blue, and green coming out in Japan, and also in time for

03:04:56.440 --> 03:04:59.740
all that stuff, they're going to be dropping the price as well.

03:04:59.740 --> 03:05:07.040
So cutting it down from 20,000 yen to 18,000 yen, and the DSi will also drop down from

03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:14.480
18,900 yen to about 15,000 yen.

03:05:14.480 --> 03:05:19.680
So that's kind of interesting, I guess getting ready for the 3DS.

03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:21.800
That blue one is kind of pretty though, so is the green one.

03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:24.320
Yellow one I could do without.

03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:29.600
Then also in the UK, the DSi is getting the price drop as well.

03:05:29.600 --> 03:05:31.880
Could they be announcing one on stage next week?

03:05:31.880 --> 03:05:32.880
Yeah, that would be my guess.

03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:34.880
Could that possibly be happening?

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:41.120
Yeah, and the funny thing is, these are all starting on June 18th.

03:05:41.120 --> 03:05:42.120
June 18th.

03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:48.560
Yeah, that doesn't coincide with something, I'm sure, if I put my mind to it.

03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:55.520
And yeah, they will be dropping the price as well from 150 euros to, looks like 120

03:05:55.520 --> 03:06:04.560
to 130 euros around there, so interesting.

03:06:04.560 --> 03:06:08.640
There's a rumor that Kim Kardashian is going to be the next Lara Croft.

03:06:08.640 --> 03:06:09.640
Whatever.

03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:14.080
Well, she's got the assets to be Lara Croft, but that's about it.

03:06:14.080 --> 03:06:19.080
She can't act way out of a box, so I don't really care.

03:06:19.080 --> 03:06:25.920
MotorStorm 3 apparently is going post-apocalyptic, and this is coming from some screens leaked

03:06:25.920 --> 03:06:30.040
on the French website PS3 Gen.

03:06:30.040 --> 03:06:36.720
They have what they claim to be some stolen images of MotorStorm 3 showing kind of a,

03:06:36.720 --> 03:06:42.840
I guess, San Francisco map that has buildings crumbling and whatnot.

03:06:42.840 --> 03:06:49.440
To me, if this is actually real, this is kind of what fuel should have been, but I kind

03:06:49.440 --> 03:06:50.440
of like that.

03:06:50.440 --> 03:06:51.440
I think that'd be kind of cool.

03:06:51.440 --> 03:06:54.880
I didn't really get into the last MotorStorm game, but the first one was pretty good.

03:06:54.880 --> 03:06:56.240
Could be interesting.

03:06:56.240 --> 03:06:58.160
I'm interested.

03:06:58.160 --> 03:07:03.800
And then finally, Def Jam Rapstar is going to be coming out, I guess, this year.

03:07:03.800 --> 03:07:08.200
Europe October 5th and North American November 6th.

03:07:08.200 --> 03:07:14.560
The game will retail for $69.99 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and $59.99 on the Wii.

03:07:14.560 --> 03:07:17.800
I'm assuming it comes with one microphone.

03:07:17.800 --> 03:07:24.560
And some of the songs that have been announced for it, they've got Biz Marquee's Just a Friend,

03:07:24.560 --> 03:07:31.960
Drake's Best I Ever Had, Ice Cube's with It Was a Good Day, Outkast's So Fresh, So Clean

03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:40.960
by Pete Rock, and CL Smooth's The Reminisce is Over You, Troy.

03:07:40.960 --> 03:07:47.840
And also Redman's and Method Man's Da Rock Wilder and Salt Peppers.

03:07:47.840 --> 03:07:48.840
Push it.

03:07:48.840 --> 03:07:49.840
Biz Marquee.

03:07:49.840 --> 03:07:52.480
Push it real good.

03:07:52.480 --> 03:07:59.480
They're going to have a freestyle mode as well as a couple of original instrumental

03:07:59.480 --> 03:08:02.920
tracks, which I guess will tie in with the freestyle mode.

03:08:02.920 --> 03:08:05.960
So, interesting.

03:08:05.960 --> 03:08:06.960
Comments from our chat room.

03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:07.960
Chat.org.com.

03:08:07.960 --> 03:08:12.320
Salacious Pop commenting on the Kim Kardashian role.

03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:15.800
You can't do backflips with an Ask That Fat.

03:08:15.800 --> 03:08:19.080
I'm Too Good says if the second Lara Croft movie was the first one, it wouldn't have

03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:20.080
bombed.

03:08:20.080 --> 03:08:23.480
It wouldn't have been the first.

03:08:23.480 --> 03:08:24.960
So I never saw either one.

03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:25.960
I got to admit.

03:08:25.960 --> 03:08:27.280
I don't watch a lot of video game movies.

03:08:27.280 --> 03:08:28.460
I did see like Resident Evil.

03:08:28.460 --> 03:08:30.600
Silent Hill was obviously the last one I saw.

03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:31.600
That's a good one.

03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:32.600
I want to go back and watch that again.

03:08:32.600 --> 03:08:36.920
I thought it was underrated by most people, but whatevs.

03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:38.440
Different movies for different people, I suppose.

03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:39.440
All right.

03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:40.440
Is that it?

03:08:40.440 --> 03:08:41.440
That's it.

03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:42.440
We're done.

03:08:42.440 --> 03:08:43.440
We're out.

03:08:43.440 --> 03:08:45.880
It's time for us to wrap up the show and say our good nights.

03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:50.200
Of course, we'll be back here next week with our big pre-E3 show.

03:08:50.200 --> 03:08:54.040
Some folks are asking for an OLR game the week before E3.

03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:56.280
We might just have to give them what they want.

03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:59.440
We are the show where every gamer has a voice after all, so we'll be doing that.

03:08:59.440 --> 03:09:01.940
We might be actually doing a press conference live.

03:09:01.940 --> 03:09:06.120
I just have to steal the audio from another site, so we'll have to figure that out.

03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:09.680
If anybody knows of a site that's doing the audio live Sunday, please...

03:09:09.680 --> 03:09:10.680
Which one is it?

03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:11.680
Microsoft?

03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:12.680
The Cirque du Soleil one.

03:09:12.680 --> 03:09:13.680
It's the tall one.

03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:14.680
It'll probably be on Xbox.com.

03:09:14.680 --> 03:09:15.680
Well, maybe it will be.

03:09:15.680 --> 03:09:16.880
We can steal the audio.

03:09:16.880 --> 03:09:21.320
We'll rebroadcast it over here with our own commentary, because it's not stealing if we

03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:24.140
provide a certain percentage of original content.

03:09:24.140 --> 03:09:26.340
And Miklotov will be here, and we'll be talking E3.

03:09:26.340 --> 03:09:29.760
It's going to be a very packed show next week, so stay tuned for that.

03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:33.760
And of course, thank you guys very much for tuning into our show and downloading it, listening

03:09:33.760 --> 03:09:35.200
live, however you did.

03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:39.900
All we ask you guys, if you enjoy what you've heard, please tell two people about our program.

03:09:39.900 --> 03:09:44.200
Help us spread the word, because we are not a big magazine or a big website.

03:09:44.200 --> 03:09:49.040
We are by the people, for the people, and we really only get our advertising done via

03:09:49.040 --> 03:09:50.240
word of mouth.

03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:51.240
That's it.

03:09:51.240 --> 03:09:52.800
We don't play any advertising on the show, so that's all we ask.

03:09:52.800 --> 03:09:54.240
Help us advertise instead.

03:09:54.240 --> 03:09:55.600
So that's it.

03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:59.080
We can't close out the show, though, until we go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

03:09:59.080 --> 03:10:00.760
Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

03:10:00.760 --> 03:10:02.480
What's your final thought, Loki?

03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:04.880
My final thought is...

03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:07.680
I'm going to be busy this week.

03:10:07.680 --> 03:10:09.440
My final thought is...

03:10:09.440 --> 03:10:12.400
I want a teriyaki chicken bowl from Jack in the Box.

03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:14.640
That sounds really good right now.

03:10:14.640 --> 03:10:19.520
Dark Soccer, what's your final thought?

03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:21.160
How's that voice coming along good, huh?

03:10:21.160 --> 03:10:22.160
What voice?

03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:23.160
You need some WD-40.

03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:24.160
All right.

03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:25.260
I've got Ricola.

03:10:25.260 --> 03:10:27.880
Thank you guys very much for listening once again.

03:10:27.880 --> 03:10:28.880
Have a wonderful week.

03:10:28.880 --> 03:10:32.240
We will see you here next week for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:36.480

03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:39.480
