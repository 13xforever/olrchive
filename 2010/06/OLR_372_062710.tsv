0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki
14000	21000	Tonight June 27th, 2010, Xbox Live might stop Final Fantasy 14 from showing up on 360
21000	26000	A classic PC game show is set to come back, and are people leaving their Facebook games?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
37000	42000	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle
42000	47000	You know what, it is that show, as we say, where every gamer has a voice
47000	51000	And joining me over the next three hours, say hello, oh my name is Rob Roberts in case you didn't know
51000	55000	Joining me over the next few hours, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
55000	56000	Hi
56000	57000	How are you?
57000	58000	Hi
58000	59000	Happy birthday
59000	60000	Yay
60000	61000	Happy birthday
61000	62000	We're old
62000	63000	Yay
63000	65000	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki
65000	66000	Hi
66000	67000	Happy birthday
67000	68000	It's not my birthday
68000	70000	Well it's the show's birthday
70000	71000	Oh
71000	76000	Orange Lounge Radio turned eight years old this week on June 23rd, was our first show
76000	77000	So there you go
77000	79000	That's why I'm saying happy birthday to everybody
79000	84000	Now I did have an actual birthday yesterday, but we don't talk about that because I really am old
84000	86000	I'm four times the age of the show
86000	88000	Who's older than you in this room?
88000	89000	Um
89000	90000	Me
90000	91000	So shut up
91000	98000	Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and introduce tonight a special guest we have here in studio
98000	104000	A very special, I almost said spatial guest because he takes up space, as he usually does here on this show
104000	106000	We always give him a hard time
106000	107000	He takes up less space than each of us
107000	111000	Actually yes, he's actually a skinny motherfucker, I hate him for it, but that's okay
111000	117000	Say hello, he has not been here in probably what, like four years or something?
117000	118000	It's been a long time
118000	119000	About a year
119000	120000	About a year, I don't know
120000	122000	Last time you were here we were at the other studio
122000	123000	By the way, say hello
123000	126000	No further ado, the 23rd Magus, also known as Drewnami
126000	128000	Do you have a new name now?
128000	129000	Drewnami
129000	130000	Drewnami still, okay
130000	133000	Because I know back in the day you were 23rd Magus for about the first three years of the show
133000	136000	Then you were Drewnami for about another, you know, I guess till now
136000	138000	I'm not due for another handle change anytime soon
138000	139000	Okay, just checking
139000	140000	So how are you?
140000	143000	Well, I heard you guys kind of missed me, so here I am
143000	144000	Well
144000	146000	And now you're in targeting range
146000	148000	Our aim consistently improves
148000	153000	Actually, it's kind of funny because you have something in common with Orange Lounge Radio, don't you?
153000	155000	Yes, I share a birthday with you guys
155000	157000	So happy birthday to you as well
157000	159000	And has a toilet paper joke book
159000	162000	Well, there's all these little in-jokes that go with Drewnami
162000	166000	Because you used to come to the show a lot back in the heyday
166000	170000	You know, we all play DDR and all those, you know, arrow stomping and arm waving
170000	174000	And button mashing and all those fun music games we used to play back in the day
174000	179000	But I gotta say, I don't know if you heard, but there's like more than 12 people listening to Orange Lounge Radio now
179000	180000	It's really
180000	181000	No!
181000	182000	I know, right?
182000	183000	Like, who would have thought, right?
183000	188000	So, catch up some of the people who've never heard you on this program before
188000	189000	What kind of games do you play?
189000	193000	What are you into and why are you here on this show?
193000	196000	Well, I'm still kind of the big Bimani buff
196000	203000	Although that's kind of waned a bit in the past couple of years since, you know, the genre's kind of waned
203000	207000	I'm the RPG, the MMO buff
207000	212000	If it's Square, if it's BioWare, I've probably played it
212000	216000	I just play a very diverse set of games
216000	221000	You must be looking very much forward to that new Star Wars game that's by BioWare
221000	223000	It's like, it's an MMO
223000	224000	The Old Republic?
224000	227000	The new one, what's the new one? Oh, I can't even remember
227000	228000	Star Wars The Old Republic
228000	229000	Is it? Okay
229000	231000	A lot of people say it's gonna be a WoW killer
231000	235000	Me, as the kind of WoW addict, I say no
235000	237000	Why does there have to be a WoW killer?
237000	240000	I mean, yes, I realize 11 million people are subscribed to WoW
240000	245000	But, you know, there's a lot more people on the planet, you know what I mean?
245000	250000	Like, I don't think WoW is gonna die by the hands of one game
250000	253000	It may die by the hands of itself one day?
253000	257000	Well, I'll get into that later because I'm really, really mad at WoW this week
257000	258000	Really mad
258000	261000	The Roman Empire was responsible for its own destruction
261000	263000	And who hears about EverQuest anymore?
263000	267000	There's gonna come a day where WoW is gonna have to go through a major overhaul
267000	271000	To kind of catch up, or, you know, to stay current
271000	274000	And, you know, sometimes these overhauls are not received very well
274000	276000	But I don't know, I mean, I don't want to get too far off topic
276000	278000	Because it's too much crystal ball and, you know
278000	281000	Well, a lot of people just don't juggle multiple MMOs
281000	284000	And I think the market's sort of reaching saturation if you ask me
284000	287000	Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangelaundraidio.com
287000	290000	And look at some comments as you folks chat live with us
290000	293000	Because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio
293000	296000	www.allgames.com
296000	299000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, he's on at about 5 Pacific
299000	301000	We're on at about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern
301000	304000	But, you know, sometimes we run late, you know, it's just a deal
304000	310000	Alright, but we're here taping live, so please, if you're listening live to us on All Games
310000	314000	Join our chat room at chat.orangelaundraidio.com
314000	316000	Okay, Ziba in our chat room says
316000	319000	Every new MMO is said to be the WoW killer
319000	322000	Remember when Warhammer Online was gonna be the WoW killer?
322000	325000	Remember when Ion was gonna be the WoW killer?
325000	327000	Remember when Eve was supposed to be the WoW killer?
327000	330000	Well, Eve still has a pretty strong cult following
330000	333000	Yeah, but it's still very niche
333000	335000	Star Trek Online
335000	339000	I was gonna say, here we have Jamie and her thing is Star Trek Online
339000	340000	And it was Ragnarok
340000	344000	And I think Star Trek Online is a good example
344000	346000	Does it have as many people as WoW? No
346000	350000	But is it probably doing successful for itself? Sure
350000	353000	It's probably making money, you know, it's so
353000	358000	Probably, I doubt Star Trek Online took all these people away from WoW
358000	362000	I think it kind of carved itself to a new audience that maybe wasn't playing WoW before
362000	365000	Like Jamie, Jamie quit WoW before STO was out
365000	369000	Well, it just seems to me that WoW is sort of like
369000	375000	Remember when we discussed Guitar Hero versus say Beatmania?
375000	380000	How it was, it brought accessibility to the genre, brought it into the mainstream
380000	381000	Oh yeah
381000	386000	A lot of MMOs are kind of following the WoW formula, so to speak, or incorporating
386000	388000	And vice versa
388000	393000	There were so many people when Guitar Hero first came out, especially the group listening to this show
393000	395000	That grew up on the Bomani Games that were like
395000	398000	Freaking ripoff of Guitar Freaks
398000	400000	This is just a stupid ripoff
400000	402000	And Guitar Freaks is better
402000	403000	And the music's better
403000	405000	And Guitar Freaks, well, okay
405000	408000	And then when Beatmania US finally came out
408000	410000	Reviews called it a ripoff of Guitar Hero
410000	412000	Well that was ignorant
412000	415000	I mean, that was just straight up written by an intern
415000	417000	Ignorant intern that should never
417000	418000	Ignant
418000	420000	Ignant intern that should never
420000	421000	That's an insult to interns everywhere
421000	422000	I'm digress, sorry
422000	424000	Sorry Do Not Me, but you know
424000	425000	But I digress
425000	429000	The thing is that Guitar Hero, you hit the nail on the head
429000	432000	Succeeded where Guitar Freaks failed because
432000	435000	Harmonix, who was the developer at the time, took a risk
435000	437000	A huge risk and made it accessible
437000	440000	Konami, too stubborn to take risks
440000	443000	And I still say that's the case with them to an extent today
443000	445000	Too stubborn to take risks
445000	447000	Anyhow
447000	449000	Wow, fun show already
449000	450000	We haven't gotten into the news
450000	451000	Let's start off with How Was Your Gaming Week?
451000	453000	We always like to talk about the games we've been playing
453000	456000	Ladies first, Dark Soccer, How Was Your Gaming Week?
456000	459000	Well, it was
459000	461000	I don't know, it actually wasn't too bad
461000	463000	Because I have a DSI now
463000	466000	I will not say how we acquired such a thing
466000	467000	Huzzah!
467000	468000	You stole it
468000	469000	Killed a hobo
469000	471000	Killed a hobo, exactly
471000	476000	So, I've actually started back into The World Is Not Enough
476000	477000	It's a cool game
477000	478000	Awesome game
478000	480000	Oh yeah, I've heard a lot of neat things about that
480000	481000	I haven't spent a lot of time with that myself
481000	483000	Wait, The World Is Not Enough, that was a Bond movie
483000	484000	The World Ends With You
484000	485000	The World Ends With You
485000	487000	Because, well, I'll tell you what my brain did
487000	489000	Okay, here's an insight into how my brain works
489000	491000	I said The World Is Not Enough, then my brain went
491000	493000	That's not right, because that spells out twine
493000	495000	What game?
495000	496000	What?
496000	497000	I just think of the garbage song
497000	498000	That's how my mind works
498000	499000	I think of the song from the James Bond movie
499000	502000	The World Is Not Enough, T-W-I-N-E
502000	503000	Yeah, I get it, T-wine
503000	505000	So I was like, I was like twine
505000	508000	Like the biggest ball of twine in, no that wasn't it
508000	510000	That's how my brain, that's the cycle that my brain went through
510000	511000	T-Pain's younger sister, T-wine
511000	514000	And then that's when I realized I was playing Sam and Max
514000	516000	And that's when I realized
516000	517000	The World Ends With You
517000	519000	And that's when I realized Joshua is still an asshole
519000	522000	And I started actually trying to play Oh And On again
522000	524000	Which spells out T-weh
524000	529000	So, also we've been watching the Mario marathon
529000	531000	Because that's super awesome
531000	534000	And I've also been sending Dan YouTube videos of this guy
534000	536000	Playing a bunch of brass instruments
536000	538000	You know, re-recording himself
538000	540000	Doing like the Mario 64 theme
540000	541000	And playing the euphonium
541000	543000	Which is one of my favorite instruments
543000	545000	I just like to say it, euphonium
548000	550000	That's really about, oh yeah yeah yeah
550000	551000	I played some Portal
551000	553000	I lusted over Portal 2 some more
553000	557000	And um, oh yeah lots
557000	558000	I love your description
558000	561000	I lusted over Portal 2
561000	563000	And I played a crap
563000	565000	You sound like you're watching YouTube
565000	567000	And your tongue is on the floor
567000	569000	That's not what you do when you lust Rob
569000	571000	So pretty
571000	574000	Anyway, and I played a crap ton of Star Trek Online
574000	577000	I played enough Star Trek Online in two days
577000	580000	To get from Commander 2 to Commander 7
580000	584000	So, because you have ten ranks in each rank
584000	587000	So I'm three ranks away from Captain
587000	588000	Mini ranks
588000	591000	Yeah, I said you have degrees of your rank
591000	595000	So I am now at Commander level 7
595000	599000	And I will be probably Captain before my surgery
599000	602000	My goal is to get to Captain before I go out for surgery
602000	604000	Let's talk about your surgery for a minute
604000	606000	Because it's going to impact the show coming up
606000	607000	Oh shit, that's right
607000	608000	Well we don't have to, you know
608000	609000	No we can tell, it was fine
609000	611000	Well you're going to be having surgery, what?
611000	612000	On the hand again, right?
612000	615000	Yes, I will be a little technical here
615000	617000	I have trigger finger
617000	619000	It's also called flexor tendinitis
619000	621000	I have it in my middle two fingers on my right hand
621000	623000	And if you want to really know what the surgery goes into
623000	624000	Just look it up online
624000	626000	I'll post something in the chatroom and gross everybody out
626000	628000	But I was awake during my last one
628000	629000	And I don't really care about my new one
629000	630000	Because I'll be awake through that too
630000	633000	I'm just glad I get my benefits
633000	635000	No, insurance, seriously
635000	638000	Healthcare is the big hot issue here
638000	642000	And thankfully I'll be on FMLA during the layoffs at my company
642000	645000	So I will still have employment at my old company
645000	647000	And still have benefits
647000	648000	And then I get laid off
648000	650000	Work that system, work it
650000	651000	And then I get laid off
651000	653000	Aww, wah wah wah
653000	655000	Hire me, I'm a designer
655000	659000	So the whole thing about this though
659000	664000	Is that basically they're going to fly my hand at the palm
664000	668000	And cut the tendon sheaths around the middle two fingers
668000	670000	And then leave it open
670000	672000	Because what's going to happen is there's a big knot in there
672000	674000	And it's going to grow over the knotting
674000	676000	So that the swelling will go down
676000	679000	And as a result I won't be able to use my right hand for at least a week
679000	681000	And it'll be replaced by a monkey paw
681000	683000	No
683000	685000	Although actually a chimpanzee would be cool
685000	687000	She really will be Jamie Summers
687000	689000	Because they're going to give her a bionic arm
689000	690000	I want a bionic hand
690000	693000	Will you be able to go go go gadget finger?
693000	698000	Is his middle finger the water pistol one?
698000	700000	Yes
700000	702000	Damn it Rob, you stole my joke
702000	706000	But no, so I'm going to go in and have my hand flayed open
706000	708000	By a specialist
708000	710000	Ooh
710000	711000	And I will
711000	713000	They have specialists that flay hands?
713000	714000	Yes they do
714000	716000	I want to be that specialist
716000	718000	So I will be here for the show
718000	721000	I just will be very slow with
721000	723000	You know, probably will not be hanging out in the chat room
723000	725000	Or I might be in the chat room just, you know, ghosting
725000	728000	Slamming down random keys
728000	731000	And the best thing about it is Vicodin
731000	733000	It'll sound like a Zaku call
733000	735000	When he doesn't stop typing on the keyboard
735000	737000	Thump thump thump thump thump thump thump
737000	738000	No
738000	740000	Jamie's slamming her monkey paw down on the keyboard
740000	742000	She's communicating
742000	744000	One thump means she's angry
744000	746000	What I want is chimp fingers
746000	748000	Or like orangutan fingers, the really long ones
748000	750000	That I can grab things and poke holes in fruit
750000	752000	So
752000	754000	But the best part is drugs
754000	756000	That's always the best part of a surgery
756000	758000	I will be on, probably on Vicodin
758000	760000	They don't really care if you hurt or not
760000	762000	They just want you to not care that you hurt

774000	776000	I love Blue Dragon
776000	778000	It's like playing a Dreamcast game
778000	780000	Hey

782000	784000	Okay

856000	858000	String quartet follow me around every time I run
858000	860000	Cause you know
860000	862000	They always play that string music whenever
862000	864000	She starts running
864000	866000	Cause the bionic man gets the
866000	868000	sound you know
868000	870000	I want the string quartet to follow me
870000	872000	Since it'll be my hand they have to play when I type
872000	874000	Alright
874000	876000	Spyro's in our chat room saying
876000	878000	Even though I'm British I still celebrate the 4th
882000	884000	Stick it to the king
884000	886000	No that's kind of like feeding
886000	888000	a cow a hamburger but okay
888000	890000	Alright
890000	892000	Double the beef why

894000	896000	I bet alright look
896000	898000	Occasionally on this program
898000	900000	We talk about video games. Loki how was your
900000	902000	Gaming week?
902000	904000	It was okay I actually played some different
904000	906000	Stuff this week because I am being
906000	908000	Forced to
908000	910000	Sit on a jury
910000	912000	Oh crap did you get picked?
912000	914000	I got picked
914000	916000	Jokes on them
916000	918000	Actually
918000	920000	Alright we're going to ask you all about
920000	922000	The case when it's done it's still going right?
922000	924000	Yeah
924000	926000	Okay so I know you can't talk about it cause but
926000	928000	Well I can't but
928000	930000	Actually
930000	932000	You want to get dismissed real quick here's your
932000	934000	Form
934000	936000	That's not dismissed that's contempt
936000	938000	When they're doing the interview she'll go
938000	940000	I support killing them
940000	942000	But it wouldn't be
942000	944000	That's okay cause Inspector Gadget can get you out of jail
944000	946000	It wouldn't be so bad if it was like
946000	948000	You know a criminal
948000	950000	Trial but no it's a civil
950000	952000	Trial you know in other words somebody
952000	954000	Is mad and so they're suing for
954000	956000	Money and that's
956000	958000	What's going it
958000	960000	I kid you not I couldn't roll
960000	962000	My eyes more than at this
962000	964000	Trial and on top of that
964000	966000	The prosecution lawyer is an idiot
966000	968000	Who talks like Andy Griffith
968000	970000	And it's hilarious
970000	972000	So is the case anything like this
972000	974000	When you're in the courtroom like you know
974000	976000	You'll just kind of be sitting there and then you know
976000	978000	Now the
978000	980000	Prosecution is going to call a witness to the stand
982000	984000	No it's not even that dramatic
984000	986000	It's like
986000	988000	Okay I kid you not we're not supposed to talk about
988000	990000	The case but we're going to talk about like this
990000	992000	Cause it doesn't really
992000	994000	No no no no listen it doesn't really talk
994000	996000	About the case at all they spent
996000	998000	An hour and a half discussing the
998000	1000000	Difference between a phone
1000000	1002000	A speaker phone
1002000	1004000	And a loudspeaker
1004000	1006000	PA system because they were
1006000	1008000	Confused or I should say
1008000	1010000	The prosecution lawyer was
1010000	1012000	Confused and we were
1012000	1014000	Falling asleep we went
1014000	1016000	Then we finally had our afternoon break we all
1016000	1018000	Walked out into the you know
1018000	1020000	Hallway and just kind of looked at each other and
1020000	1022000	Shook our heads like this is going to last
1022000	1024000	Until November
1024000	1026000	Great you got the lawyer who watched
1026000	1028000	Too much Matlock
1028000	1030000	Oh my god the guy is like it's
1030000	1032000	Seriously Andy Griffith
1032000	1034000	He introduced
1034000	1036000	He introduced himself as
1036000	1038000	Okay I'm going to screw up people's
1038000	1040000	Names I'm going to forget things
1040000	1042000	I'm going to repeat stuff I'm going
1042000	1044000	To um get
1044000	1046000	Confused but don't hold that against
1046000	1048000	My client I'm like how much
1048000	1050000	Did you pay for this guy
1050000	1052000	Hey at least he's modest Tigerclaw wants
1052000	1054000	To know court appointed Tigerclaw in our chat
1054000	1056000	Room wants to know if the case is a little more like
1056000	1058000	Night court
1058000	1060000	I'd say it's more
1060000	1062000	Night court than law and order
1062000	1064000	Oh god look out for bull
1068000	1070000	Great
1070000	1072000	So we got inspector gadget we got
1072000	1074000	Night court I don't know I
1074000	1076000	Dread what might be coming for me but that's alright
1076000	1078000	Anyways so because I've had to
1078000	1080000	Endure um
1080000	1082000	Court
1082000	1084000	I've been playing a lot of stuff on my DS
1084000	1086000	Including peggle knights
1086000	1088000	Which is
1088000	1090000	Pretty fun and of course
1090000	1092000	Um some
1092000	1094000	Planet puzzle league
1094000	1096000	And I actually played a little bit
1096000	1098000	Of grand theft auto
1098000	1100000	Chinatown wars
1100000	1102000	But I got to say man
1102000	1104000	Chinatown wars I just don't
1104000	1106000	Dig the 2D
1106000	1108000	Well not really 2D
1108000	1110000	The top down old school grand theft auto
1110000	1112000	Stuff I mean once you've been spoiled by
1112000	1114000	Number 3 and beyond
1114000	1116000	Just why go back
1116000	1118000	I will admit I don't think I ever played more
1118000	1120000	DS than when I had um
1120000	1122000	Jury duty so I feel ya
1122000	1124000	And it's just so
1124000	1126000	Terrible cause like I have to go there
1126000	1128000	At like 7 in the morning
1128000	1130000	To get a parking spot because
1130000	1132000	Our jury is
1132000	1134000	Our jury parking lot's in downtown
1134000	1136000	Sacramento where there's
1136000	1138000	No parking because they're
1138000	1140000	Dick holes that don't you know
1140000	1142000	Provide adequate parking for the jury
1142000	1144000	So you have to get there that early in order to get
1144000	1146000	Parking and then our trial
1146000	1148000	Doesn't actually start until 9 AM
1148000	1150000	So I'm sitting there just bored
1150000	1152000	Out of my mind um
1152000	1154000	For 2 hours
1154000	1156000	They waste so much time it's just ridiculous
1156000	1158000	But um in fact
1158000	1160000	We were off Thursday
1160000	1162000	Friday and Monday of next week
1162000	1164000	Because our judge is on vacation
1164000	1166000	Thank you for taking
1166000	1168000	The case right before you go on vacation
1168000	1170000	That's awesome
1170000	1172000	Um okay but anyways
1172000	1174000	Other than that um I've been playing
1174000	1176000	More Grand Theft Auto of course um
1176000	1178000	I made
1178000	1180000	Back I guess um
1180000	1182000	The ranks that I
1182000	1184000	Lost from playing some sloppy
1184000	1186000	Games um I've been taking it
1186000	1188000	Out on my co-workers so I've been beating the
1188000	1190000	Crap out of them very
1190000	1192000	Viciously uh quadrupling
1192000	1194000	Their scores at times um
1194000	1196000	And then um
1196000	1198000	What else
1198000	1200000	Earth Defense Force 2017
1200000	1202000	Because that game is still fun uh finished
1202000	1204000	Uh the
1204000	1206000	Uh the hardest
1206000	1208000	Difficulty on that so it was fun so we're going backwards
1208000	1210000	Now playing around with the genocide gun
1210000	1212000	And then uh I actually played a little bit
1212000	1214000	Of the Crackdown 2 demo hopefully
1214000	1216000	Gonna be playing the full game
1216000	1218000	By the end of this week I just have to convince them
1218000	1220000	To give me my copy because they've been sitting
1220000	1222000	On it for 2 weeks um
1222000	1224000	But yeah it's pretty fun
1224000	1226000	And Crackdown 2 uh pretty much just like
1226000	1228000	You remember the first one it's kind of cool
1228000	1230000	If you've actually played the first game you'll recognize
1230000	1232000	A lot of the stuff in the game a lot of the
1232000	1234000	Locations are very similar if not
1234000	1236000	The same in fact I was just kind of
1236000	1238000	Walking around going wow hey I reckon
1238000	1240000	Oh my god I wonder if this is here from the first
1240000	1242000	Game oh yeah it is there it is um
1242000	1244000	So that's kind of fun and the game itself
1244000	1246000	You know pretty cool
1246000	1248000	So I can't wait to pick that up and actually play
1248000	1250000	Some maybe uh co-op online and what not
1250000	1252000	Um
1252000	1254000	But yeah that's pretty much it for right now
1254000	1256000	Uh let's see my
1256000	1258000	Gaming week then if we move on to me um
1258000	1260000	Not a whole lot of new stuff
1260000	1262000	I'm still making my way through Alan Wake
1262000	1264000	One of these days I'll beat it um
1264000	1266000	But I did spend quite a bit of time on wow this
1266000	1268000	Week you know addict uh which I'll
1268000	1270000	Come back to in a minute um I also um
1270000	1272000	Play a little bit of game room cause you know I love
1272000	1274000	Me some classic games and one of my all time
1274000	1276000	Favorite classic games came out on
1276000	1278000	Game room this week H E R
1278000	1280000	O from the Atari 2600 now
1280000	1282000	I played this a little more on the Commodore 64
1282000	1284000	With the slightly better graphics but you know it's still
1284000	1286000	The same game I remember in a nutshell
1286000	1288000	Uh the H E R O it's it's
1288000	1290000	Helicopter rescue operation basically
1290000	1292000	Um and you play this little guy
1292000	1294000	That has a helicopter on his back and it's
1294000	1296000	This cute little control mechanism and you kind of
1296000	1298000	Explore caves but in
1298000	1300000	The cave there are monsters and lava
1300000	1302000	And all these things you have to avoid and
1302000	1304000	Sometimes boats that you take actually
1304000	1306000	For 2600 game it was pretty
1306000	1308000	Darn impressive I mean they really
1308000	1310000	Packed a lot into the cartridge
1310000	1312000	Um I would kind of compare it to like
1312000	1314000	Imagine like if you could fly around in pitfall
1314000	1316000	It's kind of like that cause you know pitfall was an
1316000	1318000	Activision game too but it was one of my favorite games
1318000	1320000	Uh that came out for the 2600 but it came out right
1320000	1322000	Before the big crash so I think a lot of people
1322000	1324000	Missed this game but it's on game room now and you know
1324000	1326000	It's it's worth at least checking out the demo
1326000	1328000	And see if you like it um
1328000	1330000	I'm I tried to get a top 20 score but
1330000	1332000	I found it was it was
1332000	1334000	Very scary how much I remembered like
1334000	1336000	Go down through the left tunnel instead
1336000	1338000	Of the right tunnel or go down the third passage
1338000	1340000	Like I actually remembered how to get through a lot of levels
1340000	1342000	It kind of freaked me out so
1342000	1344000	Uh yeah there was that that was fun
1344000	1346000	Let me go back to WoW for a minute cause
1346000	1348000	Something happened on World of Warcraft
1348000	1350000	This week that kind of it actually
1350000	1352000	Really ticked me off it really ticked me off
1352000	1354000	I want to say this is what I think it is
1354000	1356000	It is it's it's um a new feature well
1356000	1358000	Here's the thing you know World of Warcraft one thing
1358000	1360000	They do very well is that they release
1360000	1362000	Content patches all the time
1362000	1364000	That add new stuff to the game
1364000	1366000	New dungeons new features you know
1366000	1368000	One of the greatest things they've added to WoW
1368000	1370000	Was just a couple patches ago the dungeon finder
1370000	1372000	Uh was an amazing addition to the game
1372000	1374000	That made leveling so different
1374000	1376000	Yeah it was a great addition
1376000	1378000	This patch
1378000	1380000	Sprays diarrhea
1380000	1382000	All over World of Warcraft
1382000	1384000	It was a terrible content patch
1384000	1386000	And I'll tell you why
1386000	1388000	For one now the game crashes
1388000	1390000	Every so often now if you have
1390000	1392000	Souped up settings on your computer
1392000	1394000	The draw distance it can't handle
1394000	1396000	Then um and uh
1396000	1398000	The Ruby sanctum I guess was released
1398000	1400000	But it's not even open yet so what else
1400000	1402000	They can't open it until they get the patch
1402000	1404000	Deployed to yeah
1404000	1406000	And then they release they release this thing
1406000	1408000	Called real ID
1408000	1410000	Real ID is what
1410000	1412000	Allows you to cross communicate
1412000	1414000	Through servers through factions
1414000	1416000	To other players that you want to
1416000	1418000	Communicate with that's what I thought it was
1418000	1420000	It's kind of their way of being
1420000	1422000	Xbox live or steam I
1422000	1424000	Guess well you know the battle nets
1424000	1426000	Kind of slowly trying to kind of poke
1426000	1428000	Poke at the steam
1428000	1430000	And the uh actually I would say it's most
1430000	1432000	You know what most reminds me of is Xfire I don't know if you remember
1432000	1434000	Xfire but the whole way
1434000	1436000	Battle nets going really reminds me of what Xfire
1436000	1438000	Kind of was or is I guess
1438000	1440000	I guess they're still going well they kind of want to integrate
1440000	1442000	The Starcraft 2 players are going to be coming up
1442000	1444000	With the wild players
1444000	1446000	But real ID here's the thing
1446000	1448000	Real ID
1448000	1450000	Allows you to communicate with players
1450000	1452000	On any server
1452000	1454000	And on any faction while you're still in wow
1454000	1456000	So that's cool
1456000	1458000	But it doesn't use handles
1458000	1460000	It doesn't use numbers
1460000	1462000	It uses your real name
1462000	1464000	To communicate with other people
1464000	1466000	It uses the name you picked
1466000	1468000	When you signed up with battle net
1468000	1470000	Which defaulted to the same name
1470000	1472000	That was on your credit card that you signed up with
1472000	1474000	To pay the game
1474000	1476000	You cannot change your name
1476000	1478000	So you must use your real name to communicate with people
1478000	1480000	And I'm okay with that
1480000	1482000	Because it is for your real life friends
1482000	1484000	You're not supposed to be giving this to people
1484000	1486000	You just randomly play wow with
1486000	1488000	That's what the normal Warcraft friends list is for
1488000	1490000	I'm okay with this
1490000	1492000	Here's what I'm not okay with
1492000	1494000	And this is where I truly feel like
1494000	1496000	Blizzard hijacked my privacy this week
1496000	1498000	Is that
1498000	1500000	They copied a feature from Xbox Live
1500000	1502000	Where you can view
1502000	1504000	Your friends list and you can go into
1504000	1506000	Any of your friends and view
1506000	1508000	Their friends list
1508000	1510000	Complete with their real name
1510000	1512000	So in other words
1512000	1514000	If I add a friend
1514000	1516000	On this battle net system
1516000	1518000	Somebody
1518000	1520000	That might be trying to
1520000	1522000	Find out my real name
1522000	1524000	Because I don't know
1524000	1526000	If it's a big secret or what have you
1526000	1528000	But I don't use my real name on this program
1528000	1530000	Neither does Jamie
1530000	1532000	Loki obviously isn't his real name either
1532000	1534000	You know we use fake names on the show
1534000	1536000	That people do out there in the world
1536000	1538000	Like you know Bono
1538000	1540000	That's not his real name
1540000	1542000	Cher is probably a shortened name
1542000	1544000	Madonna really is her name
1544000	1546000	Cher is actually Cher's name
1546000	1548000	But it's a shortened
1548000	1550000	I thought she was Esther now
1550000	1552000	Forget it
1552000	1554000	My point is there's a lot of people out there that don't use their real names
1554000	1556000	And we don't either
1556000	1558000	I actually thank Travis
1558000	1560000	Back from Understation Live for making me use a fake name
1560000	1562000	Because it's been really good
1562000	1564000	I don't like my day job
1564000	1566000	And my night job to conflict
1566000	1568000	It's nothing personal you guys
1568000	1570000	But just realize I have a day job
1570000	1572000	Where I
1572000	1574000	Privacy is a huge component of my day job
1574000	1576000	And I can't have
1576000	1578000	What I do during the day and what I do during the night
1578000	1580000	Conflict with each other
1580000	1582000	And like if that were to happen
1582000	1584000	I couldn't do this show anymore
1584000	1586000	Because I have to pay my bills
1586000	1588000	This show pays me nothing
1588000	1590000	So I realize that most people are pretty respectful of that
1590000	1592000	But here's kind of my problem with Battle.net
1592000	1594000	And I know a lot of people are like
1594000	1596000	Well if you don't like it, don't use it
1596000	1598000	No shit Sherlock
1598000	1600000	But there's a lot of social pressure
1600000	1602000	To use it
1602000	1604000	I have friends of mine asking
1604000	1606000	Why won't you add me as a friend
1606000	1608000	And I tell them
1608000	1610000	I can't have you
1610000	1612000	I can control adding you as a friend
1612000	1614000	But I can't control who you put on your friends list
1614000	1616000	Well I'm not going to put anybody on there
1616000	1618000	You don't understand
1618000	1620000	That and you might know that
1620000	1622000	But there's some really messed up people in the world
1622000	1624000	I
1624000	1626000	Many years ago
1626000	1628000	Because of this program
1628000	1630000	Had a stalker
1630000	1632000	I had a stalker because of Orange Lawns Radio
1632000	1634000	I don't like to talk about it a whole lot
1634000	1636000	Because it's one of the few cases where
1636000	1638000	I almost quit doing this show
1638000	1640000	Because it was one of those cases where
1640000	1642000	The day job and the night job were starting to come together
1642000	1644000	I was getting inappropriate phone calls
1644000	1646000	On my cellular telephone
1646000	1648000	With somebody who
1648000	1650000	I had an association with
1650000	1652000	Orange Lawns Radio
1652000	1654000	I don't often talk about it
1654000	1656000	But it happened
1656000	1658000	And it's not something I want to happen again
1658000	1660000	How do I know
1660000	1662000	Knowing that there's people like that out in the world
1662000	1664000	These people might try to use my friends
1664000	1666000	To get to me
1666000	1668000	And you might be looking at that
1668000	1670000	Going wow that sounds very tinfoil hat-ish
1670000	1672000	Or wow that sounds really kind of like
1672000	1674000	You're just like obsessing
1674000	1676000	But I'm telling you
1676000	1678000	Until it's happened to you
1678000	1680000	You don't know what lengths people will go to
1680000	1682000	I know
1682000	1684000	How do you think this person
1684000	1686000	Got my phone number
1686000	1688000	That's what I'm talking about
1688000	1690000	And so
1690000	1692000	I am totally with you guys
1692000	1694000	If you don't like it don't use it
1694000	1696000	And I don't use it
1696000	1698000	Because I don't want that to happen ever again
1698000	1700000	But the problem is
1700000	1702000	It's there and now there's these social pressures
1702000	1704000	And hearing guilds out there
1704000	1706000	Are requiring people to use it
1706000	1708000	That is so screwed up
1708000	1710000	Here's my point
1710000	1712000	Blizzard is smarter than that
1712000	1714000	They should have known this would happen
1714000	1716000	When they implemented it
1716000	1718000	I don't know what in the hell they were thinking
1718000	1720000	With this
1720000	1722000	And it's not just my problem
1722000	1724000	I mean what I talked about I believe is very serious
1724000	1726000	But let's also consider that you have kids out there
1726000	1728000	16 and 17
1728000	1730000	Whose parents are paying for their Warcraft account
1730000	1732000	Absolutely
1732000	1734000	Do you think parents know how to use it?
1734000	1736000	Think
1736000	1738000	When you were 16 or 17
1738000	1740000	Did your parents know how to totally control your gaming
1740000	1742000	Because I'll tell you mine sure didn't
1742000	1744000	And it definitely wasn't because they were bad parents
1744000	1746000	It was just because I knew computers more than they did
1748000	1750000	I was playing Nintendo with my mom
1750000	1752000	And so
1752000	1754000	If
1754000	1756000	World of Warcraft had been around when I was 16
1756000	1758000	I guarantee you I would be on battle net
1758000	1760000	With my real ID with my mom's name
1760000	1762000	And that's
1762000	1764000	This is like incredibly messed up
1764000	1766000	So basically Blizzard failed
1766000	1768000	To account for the stupidity
1768000	1770000	And maliciousness of its players
1770000	1772000	Mhmm
1772000	1774000	Sorry potential stupidity and maliciousness
1774000	1776000	Of its players
1776000	1778000	Guilds requiring that?
1778000	1780000	That is insane
1780000	1782000	Because they want to know
1782000	1784000	If you're online
1784000	1786000	It's these really stupid reasons
1786000	1788000	To use real ID
1788000	1790000	That's just like
1790000	1792000	Common sense
1792000	1794000	Or you can do what I do and don't play World of Warcraft
1794000	1796000	So
1796000	1798000	With Star Trek Online
1798000	1800000	They don't require you to have that stuff
1800000	1802000	I know I'm trying to look at some of the
1802000	1804000	Comments in our chat room
1804000	1806000	Chat.orangelaunsradio.com if you want to join in
1806000	1808000	Salacious Pop says
1808000	1810000	It only takes one person in an IRL guild
1810000	1812000	To add random pickup people to ruin it
1812000	1814000	For everybody else they know
1814000	1816000	I don't control my own list but I can't control my friends list
1816000	1818000	And that's what I really don't like about real ID
1818000	1820000	So honestly like I understand
1820000	1822000	Blizzard in a board room somewhere
1822000	1824000	Must have thought this was like
1824000	1826000	A good idea to combat I don't know
1826000	1828000	Gold sellers or something
1828000	1830000	I have, you know what? No
1830000	1832000	I can't think of why this is a good idea. I really can't
1832000	1834000	Well hopefully they'll tone that down
1834000	1836000	I realize we have people
1836000	1838000	And I'm surprised every week
1838000	1840000	At who is actually listening to Orange Lounge Radio
1840000	1842000	Cause like didn't we have a guy email or call
1842000	1844000	That was like oh yeah I worked at Infinity Ward
1844000	1846000	I was there
1846000	1848000	I was like really? I didn't know we had
1848000	1850000	People that worked there to listen to this show
1850000	1852000	If we have anyone that works at
1852000	1854000	Active Blizzard that listens to this program
1854000	1856000	Will you please
1856000	1858000	Please help us get this
1858000	1860000	Fixed because it is
1860000	1862000	Just an embarrassment to World of Warcraft
1862000	1864000	Right now. You know it
1864000	1866000	Makes about as much sense as
1866000	1868000	Locking down your Facebook privacy
1868000	1870000	Settings and I think they need to do
1870000	1872000	The same thing. I know they tried to make
1872000	1874000	Battle.net a little more social
1874000	1876000	A little more Facebook like
1876000	1878000	But they stumbled on
1878000	1880000	The same problem that Facebook had
1880000	1882000	Privacy, seeing friends of
1882000	1884000	Friends that you might not want to see
1884000	1886000	I mean I keep my Facebook
1886000	1888000	Locked down tighter than a frog's ass
1888000	1890000	For a reason
1890000	1892000	Well yeah if they want to go the Facebook route though
1892000	1894000	Facebook lets me change my name
1894000	1896000	I use my radio name on Facebook
1896000	1898000	Because I actually don't want day people to find out
1898000	1900000	It's just crazy
1900000	1902000	I don't want to say it's a dual life I live because I have one life
1902000	1904000	But I'm just very conscious about
1904000	1906000	My internet trail
1906000	1908000	And I think you have to be in this day and age
1908000	1910000	And I find the easiest way to separate your internet trail
1910000	1912000	Is to use two names. It's very easy
1912000	1914000	When you do it that way
1914000	1916000	Well you know actually I'm going to tell you this
1916000	1918000	The reason why I leave my actual name up there
1918000	1920000	Is because I'm looking to get hired
1920000	1922000	Right and I don't need that right now
1922000	1924000	I'm marketing myself
1924000	1926000	And everyone's got their own reasons for it
1926000	1928000	I think that actually it's
1928000	1930000	But you know Facebook has this thing that
1930000	1932000	In their little rules or whatever
1932000	1934000	That says if they find out that you're using a pseudonym
1934000	1936000	That they can't delete your account
1936000	1938000	So anyway
1938000	1940000	Tiger Claw Chat says
1940000	1942000	If Blizzard listens to this show they need to pay attention
1942000	1944000	Sky is their biggest customer
1944000	1946000	I appreciate the sediment
1946000	1948000	And usually I'm one of the biggest proponents of Blizzard
1948000	1950000	But people that actually get suckered into
1950000	1952000	Going to Blizzcon are much bigger
1952000	1954000	Customers than I am
1954000	1956000	Yes I think you're kind of a sucker if you go to Blizzcon
1956000	1958000	And there's people I know and love that go to Blizzcon
1958000	1960000	And it's you know
1960000	1962000	It's just my personal feeling
1962000	1964000	Well and that's the whole thing is that
1964000	1966000	It's not like Blizzard doesn't get enough money out of you
1966000	1968000	Why don't you come attend for $150
1968000	1970000	This three day commercial
1970000	1972000	No thanks I'd like to be able to afford your next expansion
1972000	1974000	Exactly
1974000	1976000	That's what Blizzcon basically
1976000	1978000	I'd rather just play your damn game
1978000	1980000	Anyhow I'm getting way off topic and there's people
1980000	1982000	That really don't want to hear this whole spiel
1982000	1984000	I'm just saying
1984000	1986000	I think this is important to talk about
1986000	1988000	For a lot of different games
1988000	1990000	Because you know Blizzard sets the standard
1990000	1992000	With a lot of things
1992000	1994000	This is one scary ass standard I don't want them setting
1994000	1996000	I don't complain about Xbox Live
1996000	1998000	Because I can change my name on Xbox Live
1998000	2000000	I don't complain about Facebook
2000000	2002000	Because I can change my name on Facebook
2002000	2004000	And I can lock it down to quote the ever eloquent
2004000	2006000	Drunami tighter than a frog's ass
2006000	2008000	I cannot change my name on Blizzard
2008000	2010000	They hijacked it from my credit card
2010000	2012000	And gave me what they would be using my name for
2012000	2014000	And that was wrong
2014000	2016000	That was wrong
2016000	2018000	Ok
2018000	2020000	Yay rant stud happy show happy birthday
2020000	2022000	Happy show
2022000	2024000	Alright Drunami what have you been playing
2024000	2026000	Oh god how was my gaming year
2026000	2028000	Well yeah in a nutshell
2028000	2030000	I've been playing a whole crap load of WoW lately
2030000	2032000	I've actually been getting into the ratings scene
2032000	2034000	Staying in the ratings scene
2034000	2036000	Right now I imagine Arthas is just
2036000	2038000	Sitting on his throne like Conan looking bored
2038000	2040000	R.P. Guild
2040000	2042000	But I've also been taking advantage
2042000	2044000	Of a lot of Steam sales
2044000	2046000	I am a consumer whore
2046000	2048000	And how
2048000	2050000	I'm buying a hell of a lot of Steam games
2050000	2052000	Playing a whole lot of Steam games
2052000	2054000	Oh have you seen the sale this week
2054000	2056000	Oh god I did take advantage of Left 4 Dead 2
2056000	2058000	Civ 4 is on sale again today
2058000	2060000	I took advantage of Left 4 Dead 2
2060000	2062000	Two days ago
2062000	2064000	Yesterday they cut the price in half
2064000	2066000	Don't you hate that
2066000	2068000	And I raged
2068000	2070000	Steam is like gambling sometimes
2070000	2072000	And then I shot zombies
2072000	2074000	Then I shot zombies
2074000	2076000	I have been really getting into
2076000	2078000	The Mass Effect series
2078000	2080000	I played through Mass Effect 2 for the past couple months
2080000	2082000	Loved the hell out of it
2082000	2084000	Waiting for the third game in the trilogy
2084000	2086000	I gotta jump in here real quick
2086000	2088000	This is a very important question in chat I want to answer
2088000	2090000	Blaze in our chat room says
2090000	2092000	Is this real ID nonsense going to be in
2092000	2094000	Starcraft 2 and or more importantly
2094000	2096000	To me at least Diablo 3
2096000	2098000	Yes
2098000	2100000	So that's why even if you don't play WoW
2100000	2102000	Blizzard has a lock on some other PC gaming
2102000	2104000	And I think it's important that
2104000	2106000	You check
2106000	2108000	Check it out because you know
2108000	2110000	That's why they rushed this patch
2110000	2112000	Because Starcraft 2 is hitting shelves what next week
2112000	2114000	July 27th
2114000	2116000	Oh I thought it was like July 7th ok but soon
2116000	2118000	So they had to implement the patch anyway sorry
2118000	2120000	I just wanted to get that out there because it's a very important question
2120000	2122000	That needed answering from our chat room
2122000	2124000	Lots of Mass Effect 2 lots of Killing Fool
2124000	2126000	A very underrated
2126000	2128000	First person shooter
2128000	2130000	It's no Left 4 Dead but it's definitely underrated
2130000	2132000	Console wise
2132000	2134000	Not a whole lot
2134000	2136000	The new Tales
2136000	2138000	The Tales Symphonia sequel was good
2138000	2140000	I've been replaying that
2140000	2142000	Finally got around to beating No More Heroes
2142000	2144000	But otherwise it's just been a whole lot of WoW
2144000	2146000	And a surprising amount of FPS
2146000	2148000	I did finally get to play WoW
2148000	2152000	Saints Row 2
2152000	2154000	Mostly because a friend of mine gifted it to me
2154000	2156000	And Loki you were into that right?
2156000	2158000	Saints Row 2?
2158000	2160000	Yeah
2160000	2162000	It had a lot of bugs for the PC port though
2162000	2164000	The PC port wasn't very good
2164000	2166000	Oh yeah it just
2166000	2168000	It was still a fun game
2168000	2170000	Just not as fun
2170000	2172000	And let's see I was playing Trine
2172000	2174000	Not Twine, Trine
2174000	2176000	Had a lot of fun
2176000	2178000	Not Twine, Trine
2178000	2180000	Had a lot of fun with that
2180000	2182000	Yeah it was a lot of fun
2182000	2184000	Isn't that a LucasArts game?
2184000	2186000	No
2186000	2188000	It was an indie game
2188000	2190000	They had it on sale a couple months back
2190000	2192000	I think they had it on sale the first day of this big segment
2192000	2194000	Oh god
2194000	2196000	Valve wants my money
2196000	2198000	They really do
2198000	2200000	Other than that, that's about it
2200000	2202000	I want your money as well
2202000	2204000	You're not getting my money
2204000	2206000	So Dan is here in studio
2206000	2208000	We can't hear him because he's not on the mic
2208000	2210000	How you doing Dan?
2210000	2212000	Greetings
2212000	2214000	Since you decided to bless our show
2214000	2216000	I don't want to talk about games
2216000	2218000	But I want a moment of your show's time
2218000	2220000	I want everyone to have a very very brief moment of silence
2220000	2222000	Can I just say it's our birthday
2222000	2224000	To mourn the passing of Game Crazy this week
2224000	2226000	As of Wednesday
2226000	2228000	All Game Crazies closed down
2228000	2230000	Wasn't Wednesday our birthday?
2230000	2232000	Leaving me super unemployed
2232000	2234000	Wednesday was our birthday
2234000	2236000	Happy Birthday!
2236000	2238000	So everybody, send me your money
2238000	2240000	I'm not worried about identity
2240000	2242000	If you want to send me some money
2242000	2244000	I'll just give you my name
2244000	2246000	It's Rob
2248000	2250000	Rob
2250000	2252000	Send your money to Rob
2252000	2254000	He'll get it to me
2254000	2256000	Yes, send Rob your money
2256000	2258000	I'll be sure Dan gets all of it
2258000	2260000	Be sure to send cash
2260000	2262000	I want his real name and address
2262000	2264000	I got it
2264000	2266000	I will hook you up
2266000	2268000	I know where he'll be every Sunday
2268000	2270000	Every Sunday
2270000	2272000	I know right where he's at
2272000	2274000	I got this
2274000	2276000	Dan, you're ignoring OLR tonight
2276000	2278000	To partake in the Mario Marathon, correct?
2278000	2280000	No, not really
2280000	2282000	If I was ignoring OLR
2282000	2284000	I would be talking to you
2284000	2286000	You were a minute ago
2286000	2288000	You were on the couch watching Mario Marathon
2288000	2290000	Those guys are not very good Mario players
2290000	2292000	But it's for a good cause
2292000	2294000	Okay, it's for a good cause
2294000	2296000	We were actually sort of talking about that we should do something like that
2296000	2298000	Except you need to play Sonic
2298000	2300000	Except for you though
2300000	2302000	Something awesome
2302000	2304000	Hey, Tigerclaw's got a great suggestion in our chatroom
2304000	2306000	Maybe Dan can be on OLR more often
2306000	2308000	Now that he's jobless
2308000	2310000	And he can tell game crazy stories
2310000	2312000	I never worked on Sunday
2312000	2314000	I just didn't want to talk to y'all
2314000	2316000	I live with him
2316000	2318000	So I'm going to be on medical leave while he's off
2320000	2322000	Oh my god, one of you two is going to kill the other
2322000	2324000	Because you're both not going to be working
2326000	2328000	Yeah, tell me about it
2328000	2330000	So anyways, if anyone knows a job
2330000	2332000	I don't care what it is
2332000	2334000	I'll shovel crap
2334000	2336000	I'll play Sega games, whatever
2336000	2338000	Just give me your money
2338000	2340000	That means you, Andrew
2340000	2342000	Next week on
2342000	2344000	Next week on Orange Lounge Radio
2344000	2346000	It's the Jamie and Dan
2346000	2348000	Household survivor
2348000	2350000	Dan?
2350000	2352000	I know where you live
2352000	2354000	Only one of them can survive
2354000	2356000	I know
2356000	2358000	A fight to the death
2358000	2360000	I know you know
2360000	2362000	We're going to do Paper Plate Battle Royale again
2362000	2364000	What are you talking about?
2364000	2366000	By the way, by the way
2366000	2368000	I just saw something that makes me incredibly excited
2368000	2370000	For my big DS9 fangirlism
2370000	2372000	Is that episode 2 for Star Trek Online
2372000	2374000	Is going to be launching on July 15th
2374000	2376000	And they're including mini games
2376000	2378000	And one of them is Dabo
2378000	2380000	Oh, Rama in chat says Dan should apply to Best Buy
2380000	2382000	Uh, no
2382000	2384000	I was waiting for a comment from the living room
2384000	2386000	Dan!
2386000	2388000	Are they hiring?
2388000	2390000	Are they hiring?
2390000	2392000	I don't think he values his soul that much
2392000	2394000	Oh, oh, oh my god
2394000	2396000	Tigerclaw, brilliant
2396000	2398000	Dan can try to sign in
2398000	2400000	To be a contestant in the latest
2400000	2402000	Season of the tester
2402000	2404000	That showed that they're casting
2404000	2406000	For season 2 of the tester
2406000	2408000	Dan should go on the tester
2408000	2410000	Oh, you know every other thing he says would be
2410000	2412000	And I play this beep game beep beep
2412000	2414000	Beep game beep
2414000	2416000	That's a brilliant idea, Dan!
2416000	2418000	What?
2418000	2420000	You need to go on reality television
2420000	2422000	I thought I was on reality television
2422000	2424000	No, we're going to put you on season 2
2424000	2426000	Of the tester
2426000	2428000	Yeah, I mean you're on reality radio now
2428000	2430000	No one listens to this show
2430000	2432000	And no one watches the tester
2432000	2434000	It'll be a perfect transition
2434000	2436000	Chirp chirp
2436000	2438000	Oh, Dan's back, hooray, my yelling worked
2438000	2440000	The tester, you know that reality show on
2440000	2442000	PlayStation Network season 2 is coming up
2442000	2444000	There's shows on PlayStation Network?
2444000	2446000	Yes, you could be
2446000	2448000	Is PlayStation Network where you go on when you're not on Xbox Live?
2448000	2450000	Yes, there's actually going to have this whole
2450000	2452000	Plus thing soon too, it's crazy
2452000	2454000	The only reason I want to go on PlayStation Network is
2454000	2456000	What is that new game that looks like Strider
2456000	2458000	That's four players
2458000	2460000	I don't know, but
2460000	2462000	You could be a Sony game tester
2464000	2466000	Sony games kind of suck
2466000	2468000	Don't screw yourself
2468000	2470000	$10,000 to the winner
2470000	2472000	Necromachina
2472000	2474000	That's not really that much money
2474000	2476000	Yeah, Necromachina, you should check that out
2476000	2478000	That game looks awesome
2478000	2480000	It's on PlayStation Network
2480000	2482000	Are you playing Mario Crossover?
2482000	2484000	Yeah, they have the new version
2484000	2486000	Are you in it now?
2486000	2488000	I set mine up to work with my gamepad
2488000	2490000	It's Rad to the Max
2490000	2492000	So I've been playing Mario Crossover this week
2492000	2494000	And I've still been playing Mario Brothers X
2494000	2496000	There's my weekend gaming
2496000	2498000	And I finished Red Dead Redemption and it was sad at the end
2498000	2500000	Really?
2500000	2502000	Jimmy wants this game too
2502000	2504000	Jimmy wants everything
2504000	2506000	I got no money
2506000	2508000	Unless you send me some, send me money so I can buy my wife games
2508000	2510000	Good luck to you in the job search
2510000	2512000	Is this done by the same guy that did Strider?
2512000	2514000	You're a hard worker
2514000	2516000	You know, we have people that listen to this show
2516000	2518000	That knew you
2518000	2520000	From your store
2520000	2522000	That was like, oh my god, Jamie's married to the guy at that store
2522000	2524000	Jamie's married to that big jerk
2524000	2526000	Who works at Funkoland
2526000	2528000	That poor woman
2528000	2530000	You guys don't know what it's like here
2530000	2532000	She's insane
2532000	2534000	Alright
2534000	2536000	Let's move on, we gotta get into gaming news
2536000	2538000	Thank you, Dan
2538000	2540000	Alright, housekeeping
2540000	2542000	And things that are coming up
2542000	2544000	No show next week
2544000	2546000	We already talked about that
2546000	2548000	Oh, I wanna mention this real quick
2548000	2550000	iOS 4 is out
2550000	2552000	Which is the iPhone thing
2552000	2554000	You know, iPad software
2554000	2556000	One of the things that's new in the iOS 4
2556000	2558000	And I'm not just talking about the iPhone 4
2558000	2560000	I mean, yes, that's out too
2560000	2562000	But we realize a lot of people listen to this show
2562000	2564000	On their iPhones, their iPods, their iTouches
2564000	2566000	There's other devices too
2566000	2568000	We are aware
2568000	2570000	One of the new things
2570000	2572000	In iOS 4 is that the show descriptions
2572000	2574000	Are actually now displayed
2574000	2576000	On the screen while you listen to the podcast
2576000	2578000	So we're gonna try in a couple weeks
2578000	2580000	Something new with the notes for the show
2580000	2582000	And we think you'll really like it
2582000	2584000	But they're gonna be kind of expanded
2584000	2586000	And time stamped
2586000	2588000	So we're gonna try something new
2588000	2590000	And we're hoping you guys will like it
2590000	2592000	But that'll be in two weeks
2592000	2594000	On the podcast, or really the next podcast
2594000	2596000	That'll hit the feed after this one
2596000	2598000	It's gonna take more work that goes into it though
2598000	2600000	So, alright
2600000	2602000	Appreciate it
2602000	2604000	Yeah, I think people will like it
2604000	2606000	It's kind of been a requested feature for a while
2606000	2608000	So we'll see what happens
2608000	2610000	Alright, anyhow, we're only 45 minutes into the show
2610000	2612000	And it barely touched gaming news
2612000	2614000	How about some video game news?
2614000	2616000	We'll start off tonight with the one and only Loki
2616000	2618000	Yes, so it's been confirmed
2618000	2620000	That the 3DS is coming out in 2011
2620000	2622000	Now, of course
2622000	2624000	Before Reggie actually
2624000	2626000	Appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show
2626000	2628000	Yes, apparently
2628000	2630000	Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is now a news
2630000	2632000	Source
2632000	2634000	It was announced that the
2634000	2636000	3DS would be out in
2636000	2638000	Fiscal 2010
2638000	2640000	I believe that's Fiscal 2010
2640000	2642000	Which would be
2642000	2644000	Between now and
2644000	2646000	March 31st, 2011
2648000	2650000	But now it's been confirmed that it's actually
2650000	2652000	Gonna launch in 2011
2652000	2654000	Do the math, it's gonna be the first 3 months
2654000	2656000	Of the year
2656000	2658000	And, uh
2658000	2660000	Yeah, that's neat I guess
2660000	2662000	Hmm
2662000	2664000	Kinda disappointing I guess if you're looking forward
2664000	2666000	To it for Christmas, but hey
2666000	2668000	There's enough crap coming out during Christmas
2668000	2670000	One less thing, I can deal
2670000	2672000	With that
2672000	2674000	I totally agree that it's very
2674000	2676000	Strange that Jimmy Fallon has now become
2676000	2678000	This kind of launching point for games, cause I guess
2678000	2680000	It was actually part of like a week of games or something
2680000	2682000	Cause I don't know if you watch
2682000	2684000	I don't know if you watch the clip
2684000	2686000	But Reggie kinda takes a jab
2686000	2688000	I believe it's Sony because he says something about
2688000	2690000	And, uh, it's not like the guys that were here last night
2690000	2692000	You don't need glasses to see this 3D
2692000	2694000	He said something like that in the clip
2694000	2696000	So it was, you know, it was just Reggie being Reggie
2696000	2698000	You know
2698000	2700000	And, um, yeah
2700000	2702000	I mean, kind of a bummer though that it's
2702000	2704000	Not coming out until 2011
2704000	2706000	But I totally wanna bet with GamerEidi
2706000	2708000	And now I'm getting a lunch spot for me
2708000	2710000	So GamerEidi, if you're listening
2710000	2712000	I like steak, just saying
2712000	2714000	I'm just kidding
2714000	2716000	Well, I'm actually not kidding, I did win a bet
2716000	2718000	But, um
2718000	2720000	Do you think it was intended
2720000	2722000	Maybe for Reggie to say this on the show
2722000	2724000	Cause this seems like an odd place
2724000	2726000	To give details about the release date
2726000	2728000	Or do you think it just kinda slipped
2728000	2730000	I don't think it slipped, I think it's just that people
2730000	2732000	When they, I mean, they announced
2732000	2734000	Fiscal 2010
2734000	2736000	And people were like, oh my god, I'm buying it in 2010
2736000	2738000	Woooo
2738000	2740000	And so, instead of just everybody being disappointed
2740000	2742000	You know, by figuring out that, hey
2742000	2744000	It's not coming out at holiday
2744000	2746000	He just went ahead and announced it
2746000	2748000	So that, you know
2748000	2750000	You don't have to assume anymore
2750000	2752000	Um
2752000	2754000	What do you think this leaves for
2754000	2756000	Cause a lot of people were speculating that 3DS
2756000	2758000	And on our nightly shows for me
2758000	2760000	3, 2, I know Shane and I were having some discussions
2760000	2762000	On this, that the
2762000	2764000	3DS really had to come out this year
2764000	2766000	Like, what else does Nintendo have for Christmas
2766000	2768000	So what do you think the holidays
2768000	2770000	What do you think the holiday season's gonna look like for Nintendo
2770000	2772000	I think it's gonna be all their games
2772000	2774000	The Kirby and the Donkey Kong
2774000	2776000	Not everything, I mean
2776000	2778000	Donkey Kong I think and Kirby are gonna be this year
2778000	2780000	I think Kirby's gonna be the one that's in November
2780000	2782000	Um, there's a lot of stuff
2782000	2784000	I think for October, there's also a lot of stuff that they
2784000	2786000	Haven't announced, or announced last year
2786000	2788000	Uh, stuff that was shown on
2788000	2790000	E3 last year is coming out
2790000	2792000	I know there's a game on
2792000	2794000	The Wii, or
2794000	2796000	I can't remember if it was the Wii or DS
2796000	2798000	It was one of the ones I saw last year though
2798000	2800000	Um, so there's still stuff
2800000	2802000	That come out
2802000	2804000	For live me, I can't remember the timeline for uh
2804000	2806000	Was it Metroid Other M?
2806000	2808000	It's August 31st
2808000	2810000	It was supposed to be out a couple days ago
2810000	2812000	Cause I remember it was my birthday weekend
2812000	2814000	Actually today, I think it was supposed to be out today
2814000	2816000	But it got pushed back
2816000	2818000	Well, that'll be a Christmas gift idea
2818000	2820000	Yes, that's right, that came out instead
2820000	2822000	Nope, I have not played it yet
2822000	2824000	Yeah, I didn't really play the first one to be honest
2824000	2826000	My Wii is still not hooked up
2826000	2828000	I will probably not be hooking it up until Metroid Other M comes out
2828000	2830000	Cause I gotta play that
2830000	2832000	I've gotta play Metroid Other M
2832000	2834000	It does look cool
2834000	2836000	Um, but yeah, I just
2836000	2838000	I haven't played
2838000	2840000	Um, the Wii console since
2843000	2845000	November, I think?
2845000	2847000	Some comments in our chat room about
2847000	2849000	Pokemon Black and White
2849000	2851000	Pokemon Black and White is asking
2851000	2853000	Is Pokemon Black and White cancelled?
2853000	2855000	Um, no
2855000	2857000	I believe they even announced a release date
2857000	2859000	October 19th in Japan
2859000	2861000	Wasn't it even sooner than that?
2861000	2863000	Like the 18th of September, I thought I read?
2863000	2865000	No, it was October
2865000	2867000	Regardless, it's fall in Japan
2867000	2869000	Yeah, fall in Japan
2869000	2871000	So it won't have 3DS support
2871000	2873000	I bet you anything it'll be out April
2873000	2875000	In the US
2875000	2877000	Because that's usually when they've been releasing
2877000	2879000	Pokemon games around the April time frame
2879000	2881000	Alright
2881000	2883000	Well, we'll see if you're right or not
2883000	2885000	I guess that's true, this last little one with the Pokewalker
2885000	2887000	Ball came out in April-ish
2887000	2889000	Uh, that's March
2889000	2891000	That's right, it was right before PAX East
2891000	2893000	But, Pokemon
2893000	2895000	HeartGold, SoulSilver, that was March
2895000	2897000	Pokemon Platinum was March
2897000	2899000	Pokemon
2899000	2901000	Explorers of the Sky
2901000	2903000	Explorers of Time, that was April
2903000	2905000	Uh
2905000	2907000	Diamond Pearl was April
2907000	2909000	So, yeah
2909000	2911000	It's usually March or April
2911000	2913000	Uh, AlphaCananagram is speculating
2913000	2915000	in our chatroom at chat.orangetonjr.com
2915000	2917000	I wouldn't doubt Pokemon Black and White
2917000	2919000	will have 3DS compatibility
2919000	2921000	Remember, Pokemon Red and Blue
2921000	2923000	had colors written in the programming for
2923000	2925000	Super Game Boy
2925000	2927000	But the 3DS cards are a little bigger
2927000	2929000	Maybe it won't matter, I don't know
2929000	2931000	Could be like the advanced dungeons in Zelda
2931000	2933000	That's what I think of
2933000	2935000	They might, I mean
2935000	2937000	I would say if anything it's gonna have
2937000	2939000	DSi support, probably not
2939000	2941000	3DS
2941000	2943000	It might have some really silly stuff, like the whole game
2943000	2945000	won't be in 3D, but maybe like the evolution scenes
2945000	2947000	or something silly, just like little one-off
2947000	2949000	things will be in 3D, little little things
2949000	2951000	We'll see
2951000	2953000	I don't think so, and the only reason why is because they're gonna be in the old carts
2953000	2955000	and it's gonna be too hard to
2955000	2957000	hold that extra data on there
2957000	2959000	But DSi support's been something that they've been doing
2959000	2961000	a lot with different games, not necessarily
2961000	2963000	You don't have to play it on the
2963000	2965000	DSi, but if you do, you can
2965000	2967000	do different things
2967000	2969000	Also some other comments in chat
2969000	2971000	Rama's a big fan of the 3DS
2971000	2973000	saying, I will get a 3DS and I will shank someone
2973000	2975000	if I have to, I think a lot of people feel that way actually
2975000	2977000	Frisbee is trying to top us all
2977000	2979000	saying, I haven't played my Wii since 2008
2979000	2981000	I'm curious though
2981000	2983000	if Frisbee's gonna break it out for anything
2983000	2985000	that Nintendo announced this year
2985000	2987000	I did play Wii Sports Golf
2987000	2989000	on
2989000	2991000	Friday because they were setting up something
2991000	2993000	for some company
2993000	2995000	that we had coming into our work
2995000	2997000	They were having a Wii Sports Golf tournament
2997000	2999000	I don't think day job stuff should count though, to be honest
2999000	3001000	Well in that case, I don't play Grand Theft Auto ever
3001000	3003000	Well
3003000	3005000	Okay, you do that on your break though, but I get what you're saying
3005000	3007000	Well technically it wasn't working
3007000	3009000	if I'm playing Wii Sports Golf
3009000	3011000	But I asked them
3011000	3013000	like, why don't you have Wii Sports
3013000	3015000	Resort Golf? That would be better
3015000	3017000	Maybe they're just not ready for that
3017000	3019000	No, they're just lame
3019000	3021000	Alright, well I believe Loki warned you about this
3021000	3023000	to go to another console real quick
3023000	3025000	I believe Loki warned you about this last week
3025000	3027000	when all the E3 news was hitting
3027000	3029000	but it does seem like it has been confirmed
3029000	3031000	In fact, a Microsoft representative this week actually spoke to the blog
3031000	3033000	Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q
3033000	3035000	I'm sure a lot of you know that blog
3035000	3037000	Microsoft representative confirmed to them that
3037000	3039000	a $199 version
3039000	3041000	of their new Xbox 360
3041000	3043000	which they're now calling the
3043000	3045000	short Xbox 360
3045000	3047000	let me put that in quotes
3047000	3049000	they're not calling it the slim now, which is good
3049000	3051000	because we talked about this last week
3051000	3053000	it is not the Xbox 360 slim
3053000	3055000	it has another name
3055000	3057000	so anyway, it is going to be coming out for $199
3057000	3059000	there is also
3059000	3061000	a new setup that's going to have the
3061000	3063000	Xbox system and Kinect together
3063000	3065000	which I think a lot of people knew
3065000	3067000	so there you go
3067000	3069000	$199 Xbox 360
3069000	3071000	system coming out soon
3071000	3073000	no date, no idea
3073000	3075000	probably what, fall-ish, I think you were predicting
3075000	3077000	Loki, before the holidays for sure
3077000	3079000	for the new system
3079000	3081000	I bet you
3081000	3083000	well the new with the
3083000	3085000	Kinect isn't coming out until when the
3085000	3087000	Kinect does, so that will be November 4th
3087000	3089000	I bet you the $199
3089000	3091000	system probably as
3091000	3093000	early as
3093000	3095000	September
3095000	3097000	just to cash in on Halo Reach
3097000	3099000	so in other words
3099000	3101000	if you were thinking about
3101000	3103000	getting an Xbox right now, wait
3103000	3105000	well wait and see
3105000	3107000	anyways because you know how they
3107000	3109000	saying that there is going to be a new $199
3109000	3111000	what if they're just dropping the price of the system
3111000	3113000	to $199
3113000	3115000	you never know
3115000	3117000	I would think though
3117000	3119000	if anything, I mean they do a lot of their
3119000	3121000	price drops and big pushes towards
3121000	3123000	the holiday and especially when they
3123000	3125000	want to capitalize on a game like Halo
3125000	3127000	Reach, just wait for
3127000	3129000	some better deals to be coming
3129000	3131000	out and besides, even if you wait longer
3131000	3133000	what they've been doing
3133000	3135000	in the past is bundling in some games
3135000	3137000	with your Xbox 360
3137000	3139000	system for free, so
3139000	3141000	if you do wait, you still might get some free stuff
3141000	3143000	AlphaKananagram in our chat room
3143000	3145000	at chat.org.com is asking, wait how much
3145000	3147000	is this bundle, did they say, I must
3147000	3149000	know for Child of Eden, everyone's speculating
3149000	3151000	what, $300? I think $300
3151000	3153000	well $299
3153000	3155000	is what the system is right now
3155000	3157000	it might be $399
3157000	3159000	hmm
3159000	3161000	I wonder if there'll be a basic version with
3161000	3163000	Kinect though, I bet there is
3163000	3165000	it's hard to say, if they're gonna
3165000	3167000	do, well
3167000	3169000	I don't know, they could do a smaller hard drive
3169000	3171000	because the hard drive is removable, it is
3171000	3173000	just like the PS3
3173000	3175000	I know, isn't that awesome?
3175000	3177000	it is awesome
3177000	3179000	alright, lowkey, how big is the hard drive
3179000	3181000	are you gonna try to put a terabyte drive in there?
3181000	3183000	I'm not getting a new system, oh yeah you don't need one
3183000	3185000	you have like five Xbox 360s
3185000	3187000	I wish I had five Xbox 360s
3187000	3189000	I don't know how many
3189000	3191000	Xbox 360s I have anymore
3191000	3193000	that's crazy, that's awesome though
3193000	3195000	alright, well speaking about the Xbox 360
3195000	3197000	it doesn't look like
3197000	3199000	they're gonna really be getting Final Fantasy 14
3199000	3201000	because
3201000	3203000	their system is so different
3203000	3205000	they were wanting to play
3205000	3207000	like a normal internet environment
3207000	3209000	and wanted to basically
3209000	3211000	for the console to mirror how it works on the PC
3211000	3213000	and Microsoft
3213000	3215000	has a closed environment
3215000	3217000	so they still can't work up an agreement
3217000	3219000	yet
3219000	3221000	seems so odd to me because
3221000	3223000	I remember being at E3
3223000	3225000	a couple years ago when the Xbox 360
3225000	3227000	was just coming out, like it was the big year
3227000	3229000	that they were gonna launch the 360 and one of the games
3229000	3231000	that they were highlighting as like
3231000	3233000	landmark on that platform was Final Fantasy 11
3233000	3235000	so it's not like
3235000	3237000	Xbox Live has never had an MMO
3237000	3239000	and ironically it was the game that came out
3239000	3241000	in the same series as this game
3241000	3243000	we're hearing about now
3243000	3245000	which looks suspiciously similar
3245000	3247000	well that's a whole other Oprah
3247000	3249000	but Final Fantasy 11
3249000	3251000	I don't think it did that well
3251000	3253000	on the 360 and I really don't have
3253000	3255000	anything to base it off of
3255000	3257000	but I'm just kind of knowing who played it
3257000	3259000	what systems they were playing on
3259000	3261000	I don't think it did well on the 360 because
3261000	3263000	most people who wanted to play it already had it
3263000	3265000	on PS2 and PC
3265000	3267000	you know what I mean? I don't know if that
3267000	3269000	set a bad precedent for MMOs in general
3269000	3271000	but if that was the case, that seems kind of crappy to me
3271000	3273000	but there's one other MMO
3273000	3275000	on Xbox 360 right now and that's Fantasy
3275000	3277000	Star Universe. Again, I don't think that
3277000	3279000	did very well either
3281000	3283000	They also were trying to get champions online
3283000	3285000	they said that the game
3285000	3287000	ran just fine, it was the business
3287000	3289000	end of getting everything in line
3291000	3293000	It seems strange to me that Microsoft
3293000	3295000	is kind of shooting themselves in the foot
3295000	3297000	with these MMOs, especially with Final Fantasy 14
3297000	3299000	and DC Universe, both slated
3299000	3301000	for the PS3 this fall
3301000	3303000	I mean, this could be where the
3303000	3305000	and what, PS3 has their own agency
3305000	3307000	we know it's coming out too? What MMOs
3307000	3309000	are on their way for 360? Are there any at this point
3309000	3311000	that we know of? No
3311000	3313000	If any, they need a recent
3313000	3315000	MMO like Final Fantasy 14
3315000	3317000	I mean, if trends
3317000	3319000	are to be believed, they got
3319000	3321000	MMOs that were sort of past their prime
3321000	3323000	It's kind of just our universe
3323000	3325000	but that didn't really take off
3325000	3327000	the way that PSO did
3327000	3329000	Or they're turning their nose up at MMOs
3329000	3331000	which, you know, they could get away with doing
3331000	3333000	possibly. MMOs have always
3333000	3335000	You know, Sony somewhat is
3335000	3337000	I don't know if they're necessarily taking a risk
3337000	3339000	but the developers are taking a risk putting the games out
3339000	3341000	on PS3, but I don't know
3341000	3343000	Like, again, I really enjoy
3343000	3345000	DC Universe on the PS3 that I
3345000	3347000	played at E3
3347000	3349000	and I could see myself paying money for that
3349000	3351000	on the PlayStation 3
3351000	3353000	If they succeed, then
3353000	3355000	they're just going to have to catch up
3355000	3357000	I don't know, it just seems very
3357000	3359000	strange to me that they would not
3359000	3361000	be trying to bend over backwards to get Final Fantasy
3361000	3363000	14 on their system, but maybe they're thinking
3363000	3365000	you know what, 11 didn't do that great
3365000	3367000	so 14's not going to either
3367000	3369000	I have no idea
3369000	3371000	I think Microsoft has their own agenda
3371000	3373000	Comment from Salacious Pop
3373000	3375000	in chat, and this is something he was telling me about
3375000	3377000	earlier today, and I want to share this with you guys too
3377000	3379000	Champions Online was developed
3379000	3381000	for a 360 release
3381000	3383000	Even playing the PC version
3383000	3385000	you can see the 360 integration
3385000	3387000	screaming at you from the UI
3387000	3389000	Champions Online was a huge flop
3389000	3391000	and it probably has to do with the fact that at least
3391000	3393000	50% of its platform audience never
3393000	3395000	actually got the game
3395000	3397000	So there you go
3397000	3399000	Champions Online
3399000	3401000	maybe was, unfortunately
3401000	3403000	did end by this whole fact that
3403000	3405000	the 360 was not going to be having its MMO
3405000	3407000	or made it too difficult
3407000	3409000	Unfortunate
3409000	3411000	Bochikawa says
3411000	3413000	PS3 is a free online service
3413000	3415000	same on PC, I think Microsoft lost
3415000	3417000	majorly because of that
3417000	3419000	Well keep in mind, I can't remember for PSU
3419000	3421000	but I know for Final Fantasy 11
3421000	3423000	it would work with a silver account
3423000	3425000	The really crazy thing about
3425000	3427000	Final Fantasy 11 I think people sometimes forget
3427000	3429000	is that it had this whole
3429000	3431000	play online front end
3431000	3433000	they're not going to have that for Final Fantasy 14
3433000	3435000	thank god
3435000	3437000	Play Online was cool for like 30 days
3437000	3439000	and then it was like, this thing is a pain in the butt
3439000	3441000	Play Online was never cool
3441000	3443000	Play Online was never cool
3443000	3445000	I thought it was cool when it first came out
3445000	3447000	but that was it. But anyhow
3447000	3449000	Play Online is on the 360 version
3449000	3451000	but here's the crazy thing about Play Online
3451000	3453000	It's a joint venture between
3453000	3455000	Square Enix and
3455000	3457000	and Sony
3457000	3459000	Play Online is a
3459000	3461000	Sony code and it was on
3461000	3463000	the 360
3463000	3465000	Final Fantasy 11
3465000	3467000	was a really not typical
3467000	3469000	game on the 360
3469000	3471000	it broke all the rules
3471000	3473000	but they were excited to have a Final Fantasy game on their
3473000	3475000	console, they let it break the rules
3475000	3477000	just like they let Castlevania
3477000	3479000	break the rules and it ended up setting a
3479000	3481000	precedent with the whole
3481000	3483000	Symphony of the Night coming out on the arcade
3483000	3485000	breaking the cap
3485000	3487000	Keep in mind, in Japan
3487000	3489000	Symphony of the Night did come out on the Saturn
3489000	3491000	What's that have to do with the 360
3491000	3493000	one though? Because
3493000	3495000	even back in the day
3495000	3497000	Sony didn't
3497000	3499000	have the whole exclusive
3499000	3501000	it was supposed to have been
3501000	3503000	exclusive and then the Saturn version came out
3503000	3505000	which apparently had all the stuff that the programmers
3505000	3507000	never got to put in. I see, I get you
3507000	3509000	so
3509000	3511000	I don't know, it would be interesting to see
3511000	3513000	what kind of comes of that
3513000	3515000	And the Saturn version was better. I think honestly
3515000	3517000	if you haven't heard of it by this point Final Fantasy 14
3517000	3519000	will not be on the 360
3519000	3521000	release date anyway. Can they add it
3521000	3523000	next year if the game becomes popular?
3523000	3525000	Maybe, but I don't know
3525000	3527000	I don't know
3527000	3529000	guys, I really don't
3529000	3531000	I'll try Final Fantasy 14 but I'm just kind of like
3531000	3533000	there's something about it
3533000	3535000	I have a really bad feeling
3535000	3537000	it's gonna flop
3537000	3539000	I don't know what it is
3539000	3541000	I think just because 11 was so received mixed
3541000	3543000	and I don't think the
3543000	3545000	PS3 is as adopted as the PS2
3545000	3547000	was and the 360
3547000	3549000	I don't know, call me crazy
3549000	3551000	What's funny is there's still a Final Fantasy
3551000	3553000	14 SKU on Xbox 360
3553000	3555000	it still exists
3555000	3557000	whether it's actually gonna come out or not
3557000	3559000	Well I think it's a place holder
3559000	3561000	You know what though, there might be a lot that
3561000	3563000	they're developing that they don't plan on releasing
3563000	3565000	I mean maybe a 360 version is further
3565000	3567000	along than any of us are giving credit for
3567000	3569000	because one other thing I don't know if we
3569000	3571000	talked about when we did the E3 report but
3571000	3573000	Final Fantasy 14 also supports 3D
3573000	3575000	right now. You can put on 3D glasses
3575000	3577000	if you have those uber monitors for your PC
3577000	3579000	you can play Final Fantasy 14 in 3D
3579000	3581000	so, but they
3581000	3583000	they took great caution to
3583000	3585000	tell us
3585000	3587000	we're messing with this right now, we don't know if it's
3587000	3589000	gonna be in the full release
3589000	3591000	this is a concept thing that you're seeing
3591000	3593000	so, who knows there
3593000	3595000	Bochikawa in our chatroom
3595000	3597000	says 14 will suck, yes, but it will still sell
3597000	3599000	we'll see, we'll see
3599000	3601000	again, I hate to base my opinion
3601000	3603000	off an early build of the game
3603000	3605000	I do believe though, I think
3605000	3607000	if 14 gets delayed to next year
3607000	3609000	it's not bad news
3609000	3611000	but that's just me
3611000	3613000	anyhow, Loki, what do you got for us?
3613000	3615000	Apparently there's a rumor coming
3615000	3617000	from Bloomberg saying
3617000	3619000	that Sony may
3619000	3621000	close a deal
3621000	3623000	securing the rights
3623000	3625000	to bring Hulu
3625000	3627000	to the PlayStation Network, it says the partnership
3627000	3629000	could be announced as soon as next
3629000	3631000	week and
3631000	3633000	that's kind of interesting since
3633000	3635000	you know, apparently there's
3635000	3637000	also a similar report saying that
3637000	3639000	it might be coming to Xbox 360
3639000	3641000	and the iPad as well
3641000	3643000	and would offer a premium Hulu
3643000	3645000	service where you could possibly pay
3645000	3647000	for maybe streaming of old
3647000	3649000	you know, archive stuff
3649000	3651000	kind of
3651000	3653000	interesting actually that
3653000	3655000	they're thinking about bringing to that platform
3655000	3657000	I don't know, I think it'll eventually
3657000	3659000	probably make its way to
3659000	3661000	each console platform
3661000	3663000	except for the Wii maybe
3663000	3665000	but why not, you can kind of
3665000	3667000	do it right now with, well you could have done it
3667000	3669000	before with the web browser, you can do it with
3669000	3671000	third party software like diversity and stuff
3671000	3673000	like that, but
3673000	3675000	I could definitely see this happening
3679000	3681000	It's interesting that Hulu keeps coming up
3681000	3683000	time and time again, like it's just like
3683000	3685000	it happened already, darn it
3685000	3687000	yeah
3687000	3689000	it's just
3689000	3691000	a matter of time
3691000	3693000	we're just waiting to see what
3693000	3695000	happens
3695000	3697000	alright, well something I really don't think
3697000	3699000	you need to wait much longer to see if it happens or not
3699000	3701000	has to do with the price of Kinect
3701000	3703000	you know what we've been saying
3703000	3705000	you know, as have most of the gaming press
3705000	3707000	that Kinect is going to cost you
3707000	3709000	$150, but Microsoft for whatever reason
3709000	3711000	just won't confirm it, like
3711000	3713000	they will not tell you the price of Kinect
3713000	3715000	but then this week, on the official
3715000	3717000	Microsoft store, that's right
3717000	3719000	online, you know, Microsoft has a store online
3719000	3721000	just like Apple does, and a lot of different companies do
3721000	3723000	they now are selling the Kinect
3723000	3725000	sensor for the Xbox 360 for
3725000	3727000	$149.99
3727000	3729000	so there you go
3729000	3731000	that's like, what a week costs
3731000	3733000	yeah, interesting, huh
3733000	3735000	I really hope this comes with
3735000	3737000	a bundle in game, cause just
3737000	3739000	$150 for the device itself
3739000	3741000	it better come with a bundle of several games
3741000	3743000	ow, I shot myself in the foot
3743000	3745000	well
3745000	3747000	the rumor is, it is
3747000	3749000	coming bundled with a game
3749000	3751000	oh really, Loki, what have you heard?
3751000	3753000	um, I heard that there's going to be a pack-in game
3753000	3755000	not sure what it is
3755000	3757000	um, I don't think it's anything that's probably been
3757000	3759000	announced yet, it's probably just tech demos
3759000	3761000	well not tech demos, but like
3761000	3763000	remember how Wii Sports was
3763000	3765000	that was all their tech demos
3765000	3767000	that'd be my guess
3767000	3769000	it could be very well
3769000	3771000	one of like, Kinect Sports or something like that, you never know
3771000	3773000	well one other quick thing on Kinect I want to get
3773000	3775000	out there is that if you were unable to go to
3775000	3777000	E3, and you happen to
3777000	3779000	live near a Microsoft store
3779000	3781000	there's not a lot of these, there's like
3781000	3783000	four, I think there's like two in Southern California
3783000	3785000	one in Arizona, I want to say
3785000	3787000	there's not a lot of these, there's like four Microsoft
3787000	3789000	stores, they're kind of like Apple
3789000	3791000	stores, but instead of Apple
3791000	3793000	it's Microsoft
3793000	3795000	you can play the Kinect in the stores
3795000	3797000	they actually have the demos right now
3797000	3799000	Kinectimals, according to the official
3799000	3801000	Twitter for the stores, which is at
3801000	3803000	the Microsoft store on Twitter
3803000	3805000	is the game that's being shown off right now
3805000	3807000	so it sounds like they were going to rotate in
3807000	3809000	different Kinect games
3809000	3811000	you know what I noticed when they have a new piece of
3811000	3813000	interface technology, remember when the DS
3813000	3815000	was just released and they just
3815000	3817000	had games
3817000	3819000	that amounted to just tech demos, I mean like
3819000	3821000	Yoshi Touch and Go
3821000	3823000	and then for the first
3823000	3825000	first part of the lifespan of the Wii
3825000	3827000	they just had games that were mostly just tech demos
3827000	3829000	I would hope since
3829000	3831000	the motion sensor technology has matured by now
3831000	3833000	that Microsoft would have
3833000	3835000	more than glorified tech demos
3835000	3837000	well the technology has matured but unfortunately
3837000	3839000	people and developers
3839000	3841000	have not matured and
3841000	3843000	I understand that developers
3843000	3845000	can do way better than what's out there
3845000	3847000	right now, but people like what's
3847000	3849000	out there right now and so that's why they're
3849000	3851000	emulating the same stuff you see on other systems
3851000	3853000	like a Wii sports type game
3853000	3855000	a Wii sports resort type game
3855000	3857000	a party game
3857000	3859000	you know that kind of stuff
3859000	3861000	since you brought up the DS launch titles though
3861000	3863000	I have to say this because this always cracks me up
3863000	3865000	you know what DS game
3865000	3867000	I don't know if it was a launch title but it came out in the first
3867000	3869000	three months, it was a launch
3869000	3871000	I owned Ping Pals
3871000	3873000	Oh it was so terrible, Ping Pals was so
3873000	3875000	I bought two copies, I was coerced into buying
3875000	3877000	two copies
3877000	3879000	it was so terrible, but here's why
3879000	3881000	it was this awesome DS game
3881000	3883000	I say awesome very sarcastically by the way
3883000	3885000	where you could chat
3885000	3887000	with other people on their
3887000	3889000	nearby DS's by like
3889000	3891000	drawing and you could do these
3891000	3893000	draw chats back and forth
3893000	3895000	and that's what Ping Pals was all about
3895000	3897000	it was PictoChat with avatars
3897000	3899000	boy Nintendo fucked them over
3899000	3901000	didn't they by putting that in their system
3901000	3903000	and it was $30 times two
3907000	3909000	it's like yeah you can pay for this
3909000	3911000	or you can play it for free now
3911000	3913000	yeah Ping Pals wasn't even online
3913000	3915000	it had these avatars
3915000	3917000	I guess there was some type of game
3917000	3919000	you may remember Rob
3919000	3921000	that when the DS came out
3921000	3923000	they didn't have online
3923000	3925000	that's right
3925000	3927000	it was like that hidden thing
3927000	3929000	Nintendo always puts that magical
3929000	3931000	thing in their new system
3931000	3933000	they'll tell you later, gotcha
3933000	3935000	it was in there the whole time
3935000	3937000	there's always something like that
3937000	3939000	seriously, with the DS it was the internet
3939000	3941000	secretly it was there the whole time
3941000	3943000	the Wii has some slumbering
3943000	3945000	stuff like that too, the channels
3945000	3947000	that they come out with
3947000	3949000	so since the buying public
3949000	3951000	is used to it, Microsoft's gonna
3951000	3953000	pick up a shovel and Sony's gonna pick up
3953000	3955000	a shovel and just start shoveling
3955000	3957000	games our way
3957000	3959000	well here's what I'm saying
3959000	3961000	I understand that
3961000	3963000	the Wii has the advantage of the price
3963000	3965000	point because it's $150
3965000	3967000	now
3967000	3969000	and they do have the
3969000	3971000	disadvantage that they're getting
3971000	3973000	you have to buy the extra sensor
3973000	3975000	if you wanna play those games
3975000	3977000	um
3977000	3979000	but I mean once again it's all about
3979000	3981000	perception because yeah, Wii costs
3981000	3983000	you know, $150 but
3983000	3985000	let's say if you're playing, you know, setting it up
3985000	3987000	for a family of four, it's gonna
3987000	3989000	cost a lot more to do that with the Wii
3989000	3991000	than it would be on the Xbox 360
3991000	3993000	I mean
3993000	3995000	even though you may, you know, it may seem
3995000	3997000	that the Wii's a better choice with all the extra
3997000	3999000	added crap to it, it's gonna
3999000	4001000	add up and
4001000	4003000	with Sony it's the same thing, you're gonna have to
4003000	4005000	buy all these different accessories, now I know you
4005000	4007000	don't have to buy all these accessories if you
4007000	4009000	wanna play by yourself, that's fine
4009000	4011000	or if you wanna play with just one other person
4011000	4013000	you know, then you can save yourself a little bit
4013000	4015000	of money but at least with the Kinect
4015000	4017000	it'll support up to as many players
4017000	4019000	as the game will support
4019000	4021000	alright, before we get to Jamie's next
4021000	4023000	story and then the release dates here, I've gotta read this
4023000	4025000	real quick because this was linked to us in chat by Robocoon
4025000	4027000	linked us to the official Ping Pals
4027000	4029000	Wikipedia article and I've gotta read this
4029000	4031000	excerpt cause it's gold, ready?
4031000	4033000	Keep in mind this is Wikipedia
4033000	4035000	Ping Pals was released on December 8th
4035000	4037000	2004, although it was marketed
4037000	4039000	as a non-violent, girl-friendly game
4039000	4041000	it was frequently criticized as not
4041000	4043000	being interactive enough to be called a game
4043000	4045000	in addition to this, the DS has a
4045000	4047000	built-in chat program called PictoChat
4047000	4049000	PictoChat includes features that
4049000	4051000	Ping Pals lacks and due to this, the game
4051000	4053000	received poor ratings, for instance
4053000	4055000	Nintendo Official Magazine gave
4055000	4057000	it 9% in its Nintendo
4057000	4059000	DS special with the opening
4059000	4061000	sentence saying, with PictoChat
4061000	4063000	coming as standard, this is
4063000	4065000	a bit like paying money to breathe air
4065000	4067000	the reviewer
4067000	4069000	gave a one-word written summary reading
4069000	4071000	pointless
4071000	4073000	uh, let's see, uh, Electronic
4073000	4075000	Gaming Monthly gave the game an average of
4075000	4077000	.5 out of 10
4077000	4079000	with the game receiving two zeroes and
4079000	4081000	one 1.5
4081000	4083000	it was really shiny, girl-friendly air
4083000	4085000	that's my favorite, girl-friendly
4085000	4087000	ha ha ha
4087000	4089000	yeah, that's why I had to buy two
4089000	4091000	copies, I love it, maybe even a brain-dead
4091000	4093000	vegetable hooked up to life support girl-friendly
4093000	4095000	the GM, GMR magazine
4095000	4097000	gave it a 0 out of 10
4097000	4099000	it's below their normal scale
4099000	4101000	nice, alright, Dar Sakura
4101000	4103000	what do you have for us, do you have a girl-friendly story for us?
4103000	4105000	I have something that makes me happy, okay
4105000	4107000	Facebook games are going poop
4107000	4109000	um, and keep
4109000	4111000	in mind the only thing that I play is Hotel City
4111000	4113000	good, I'm a fan of not playing Farmville
4113000	4115000	yeah, I hate Farmville
4115000	4117000	Farmville is like the poop
4117000	4119000	that dung beetles poop
4119000	4121000	Farmville's free on the iPhone
4121000	4123000	right now, you know
4123000	4125000	they'd have to pay me, at any rate
4125000	4127000	my friends are now playing Frontierville
4127000	4129000	Gamasutra, um
4129000	4131000	keeps up with, you know, who's
4131000	4133000	playing what on Facebook games
4133000	4135000	and, um, basically
4135000	4137000	uh, the
4137000	4139000	the big Zynga games have gone down
4139000	4141000	um, Farmville went from
4141000	4143000	66.6 million, ooh, evil
4143000	4145000	to 63.9 million
4145000	4147000	Treasure Isle dropped 2.5
4147000	4149000	million, and Cafe World lost 1.5
4149000	4151000	million, um, the only
4151000	4153000	thing there that's really keeping it
4153000	4155000	steady is, uh
4155000	4157000	well, that's attracted new players is
4157000	4159000	Texas Hold'em Poker
4159000	4161000	they got 28.6 million players
4161000	4163000	you gotta wonder how many of those are actual people
4163000	4165000	I, you know
4165000	4167000	I hate the stupid games
4167000	4169000	I think people are finally starting to go
4169000	4171000	I'm wasting my time
4171000	4173000	I could do something
4173000	4175000	have you ever heard the music in Farmville?
4175000	4177000	oh, they made new ones
4177000	4179000	what?
4179000	4181000	oh god, when I played Farmville, nevermind
4181000	4183000	when I used to play Farmville
4183000	4185000	the theme song was so horrible, it was this
4185000	4187000	one thing that would loop over and over
4187000	4189000	and over again, I guess now
4189000	4191000	I tried it once
4191000	4193000	and then I was like
4193000	4195000	ugh, why
4195000	4197000	and like, it's not even why is a question
4197000	4199000	it's why is a statement
4199000	4201000	like, if I was typing it
4201000	4203000	it would be, it would have no capitalization
4203000	4205000	and have a period at the end
4205000	4207000	it would just be why
4207000	4209000	or what
4209000	4211000	what
4211000	4213000	yeah, it would be a statement, it wouldn't even
4213000	4215000	require grammar
4215000	4217000	but see, here's the thing
4217000	4219000	I'm actually really looking forward to the Civilization
4219000	4221000	Facebook game
4221000	4223000	like, there's some really cool sounding stuff around the corner
4223000	4225000	you're a civ nerd
4225000	4227000	I really am
4227000	4229000	go by civ
4229000	4231000	like 7-Elevenville
4231000	4233000	I don't think I'll play 7-Elevenville
4233000	4235000	but no, I would go into 7-Elevenville
4235000	4237000	that's not a joke, is it?
4237000	4239000	Zanga Zanga Zanga Zanga
4239000	4241000	whatever has really taken over 7-Eleven
4241000	4243000	it's kind of disgusting
4243000	4245000	what kind of Slurpees do they have?
4245000	4247000	I didn't even look
4247000	4249000	at the Iron Man stuff
4249000	4251000	did you see what was in my kitchen?
4251000	4253000	I have a War Machine Slurpee cup
4253000	4255000	I don't even drink Slurpees
4255000	4257000	and I got a War Machine cup because I'm gonna repaint it
4257000	4259000	what's great though is some of the Farmville parodies
4259000	4261000	I gotta say, because there's one called Farmvillain
4261000	4263000	that's great
4263000	4265000	that I guess, like Robocoon is saying
4265000	4267000	you can now collect horse semen on your farm
4267000	4269000	like, there's, you know, horrible things that happen there
4269000	4271000	Rama says in our chat room
4271000	4273000	and this is why I play Pot Farm
4273000	4275000	that's gonna be a reality
4275000	4277000	in California after November
4277000	4279000	I don't know if you heard
4279000	4281000	it's qualifying for the ballot
4281000	4283000	do you want to smoke weed?
4283000	4285000	yes or no, in a nutshell
4285000	4287000	oh god, what is my anti-nausea medication
4287000	4289000	it'll pass
4289000	4291000	well, not even a question
4291000	4293000	it's gonna pass
4293000	4295000	I'm glad you asked, because it's coming in November
4295000	4297000	no, no, no, no
4297000	4299000	the anti-nausea medication FROM
4299000	4301000	all that
4301000	4303000	yeah, but that actually is good for anti-nausea
4303000	4305000	they're actually allergic to it, but then again some people also allergic to cigarette smoke
4305000	4307000	dude, California's gonna be the only place
4307000	4309000	where you can go to Taco Bell
4309000	4311000	and get a number one that comes with a quesadilla
4311000	4313000	two crispy tacos
4313000	4315000	a gordita
4315000	4317000	and BUD
4317000	4319000	and a joint
4319000	4321000	we're gonna be
4321000	4323000	Amsterdam the sequel
4323000	4325000	oh my god, it's a good time to stay indoors
4325000	4327000	just need the hookers now
4327000	4329000	here's the thing
4329000	4331000	for like 60 days
4331000	4333000	ahh, it's too far away
4333000	4335000	for 60 days, it's gonna be the most
4335000	4337000	lolsy thing you could ever imagine
4337000	4339000	everybody will be
4339000	4341000	eye for like 60 days
4341000	4343000	not everybody, I don't smoke pot
4343000	4345000	California stood still
4345000	4347000	there's gonna be so many people
4347000	4349000	just like, it's 4.20 every day
4349000	4351000	and then, you know what
4351000	4353000	it's gonna, ok, alright
4353000	4355000	it's like when prohibition was eliminated
4355000	4357000	drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, pass out, wake up
4357000	4359000	ok, we're over
4359000	4361000	I'm gonna get political for a second, Rob, may I?
4361000	4363000	oh hell why not
4363000	4365000	disclaimer, ok, let's go ahead
4365000	4367000	and look back at history, and this is why
4367000	4369000	this whole stupid war on drugs thing is
4369000	4371000	pretty much bullshit
4371000	4373000	when they made booze
4373000	4375000	illegal, what happened?
4375000	4377000	an increase in crime
4377000	4379000	we had the heyday of the
4379000	4381000	old school gangster
4381000	4383000	you know, but Dick Tracy was here
4383000	4385000	to make it all better
4385000	4387000	but my point is
4387000	4389000	that when you made booze illegal
4389000	4391000	crime went up
4391000	4393000	now, and this is actually
4393000	4395000	the best way I can paraphrase it
4395000	4397000	ok, there was a Bloom County strip
4397000	4399000	a while back, you know where Opus the Penguin came from
4399000	4401000	and
4401000	4403000	he and Oliver Wendell
4403000	4405000	Jones
4405000	4407000	were selling
4407000	4409000	hair growing tonic made from cat sweat
4409000	4411000	and
4411000	4413000	the moment it became illegal, their prices
4413000	4415000	shot up, so they could charge more
4415000	4417000	for it, and then they were having people
4417000	4419000	you know, run guns and everything
4419000	4421000	and another one actually in the same comic
4421000	4423000	is when
4423000	4425000	Opus and Bill were running for president
4425000	4427000	and the drug traffickers came up and said
4427000	4429000	we hope you'll have tough gun laws, that makes
4429000	4431000	more profit for us
4431000	4433000	I mean, I know that that's
4433000	4435000	you know
4435000	4437000	a parody, you know, just a little political
4437000	4439000	commentary on it, but
4439000	4441000	the numbers are there
4441000	4443000	you know, gun free zones
4443000	4445000	have a higher
4445000	4447000	rate of gun related deaths
4447000	4449000	than
4449000	4451000	you know, places where it's legal to
4451000	4453000	carry a firearm
4453000	4455000	criminals don't really care if it's legal or not
4455000	4457000	no, but they're less likely
4457000	4459000	to use it when the other person might be armed too
4459000	4461000	I feel like Jamie should have a theme song when she's giving
4461000	4463000	history lessons here on the show
4463000	4465000	so do you want to continue with your history lesson
4465000	4467000	yes I do
4467000	4469000	I'll play a little bit of
4469000	4471000	God Save the Queen here
4471000	4473000	anyway
4477000	4479000	but I'm saying
4479000	4481000	I'm going to completely second what you said
4481000	4483000	Rob, the moment that the
4483000	4485000	pot loss pass
4485000	4487000	you're going to have a month where people are going to go
4487000	4489000	ahhhhh
4489000	4491000	and all of the right wing nut jobs
4491000	4493000	are going to go, ah see we told you
4493000	4495000	and then
4495000	4497000	a month later, two months later
4497000	4499000	it'll be nothing, no one will care
4499000	4501000	you mean I can go outside?
4501000	4503000	yes, it's safe
4503000	4505000	you mean I actually do go outside?
4505000	4507000	um, it's safe
4507000	4509000	but you know what this means
4509000	4511000	there will come a day
4511000	4513000	the Orange Lounge radio episode where we're all
4513000	4515000	high as fuck
4515000	4517000	and that will be just another episode
4517000	4519000	where I'm in the chat room
4519000	4521000	yeah, me too, it'll sound like every other episode
4521000	4523000	yeah, I'm allergic to pot too
4523000	4525000	but my whole point
4525000	4527000	my whole point, and this is the
4527000	4529000	biggest thing with, in fact
4529000	4531000	I've been listening to a lot of
4531000	4533000	history podcasts and maybe I'll plug
4533000	4535000	them later, but
4535000	4537000	the biggest thing for anyone
4537000	4539000	if you want to look at what's going on in business
4539000	4541000	right now, if you want to look at what's going on
4541000	4543000	in politics right now
4543000	4545000	if you want to see, is A or
4545000	4547000	B going to work, look
4547000	4549000	to about a hundred
4549000	4551000	to eighty years ago
4551000	4553000	and
4553000	4555000	you know, then tell me, will it work?
4555000	4557000	well I think
4557000	4559000	oh, it's the same idea, it's the same idea
4559000	4561000	I think in this year, 2010
4561000	4563000	the question is not, will it work
4563000	4565000	but will it blend
4565000	4567000	alright
4567000	4569000	but, okay, thank you for letting me rant
4569000	4571000	you're welcome
4571000	4573000	just the biggest thing is that
4573000	4575000	if you want to see if something's going to work now
4575000	4577000	look to the past
4577000	4579000	Frisbee in our chat room says, OLR with weed
4579000	4581000	is Orange Lounge foodie-o, like I said
4581000	4583000	just like every other week
4583000	4585000	have you ever done OLR
4585000	4587000	on weed?
4587000	4589000	you boys like Mexico?
4589000	4591000	and by the way
4591000	4593000	one last little political
4593000	4595000	snipe, if you
4595000	4597000	want to see what
4597000	4599000	for all the advocates that were
4599000	4601000	voting for unregulated business
4601000	4603000	look back to
4603000	4605000	Carnegie and to
4605000	4607000	Rockefeller and see how well
4607000	4609000	people fared when they were in control
4609000	4611000	of unregulated business
4611000	4613000	including moderation
4613000	4615000	alright, yes, moderate moderation
4615000	4617000	alright, that's redundant
4617000	4619000	alright, let's
4619000	4621000	thank you for calling the department
4621000	4623000	your redundancy is repetitive
4623000	4625000	alright, let's move on
4625000	4627000	release dates
4627000	4629000	weed is coming out November 4th
4629000	4631000	just kidding
4631000	4633000	alright, what's coming out in the US
4633000	4635000	you know that's kind of odd
4635000	4637000	it's timed right with the connect
4637000	4639000	connect
4639000	4641000	works off weed
4641000	4643000	anyways, there's
4643000	4645000	lots of stuff actually coming out this week
4645000	4647000	pretty decent release week which is good because
4647000	4649000	next week there's not a whole lot
4649000	4651000	so this week we've got
4651000	4653000	Sin and Punishment start successor
4653000	4655000	actually it's not this week, that's today
4655000	4657000	so you've missed out on it already
4657000	4659000	possibly
4659000	4661000	and you wasted your whole day watching the Mario
4661000	4663000	marathon and you could have been playing Sin and Punishment
4663000	4665000	Sin and Punishment, at least it's a good cause
4665000	4667000	Death Smiles
4667000	4669000	limited edition, making its way out to the
4669000	4671000	Xbox 360 this week
4671000	4673000	a pretty awesome shmup game, definitely worth
4673000	4675000	picking up, and plus you get a nice little
4675000	4677000	face plate for your Xbox 360
4677000	4679000	and the soundtrack, so
4679000	4681000	sounds like a good deal
4681000	4683000	Think Smart on Nintendo DS, yet another brain
4683000	4685000	training game
4685000	4687000	Lego Harry Potter on the
4687000	4689000	Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4689000	4691000	Wii, DS, and PSP
4691000	4693000	and probably the PC as well
4693000	4695000	A 10 Minute Solutions from
4695000	4697000	Activision, it's a fitness game
4697000	4699000	based off, I guess, a DVD series
4699000	4701000	99 Nights 2
4701000	4703000	now with more nights
4705000	4707000	Coming to Xbox 360
4707000	4709000	99 Nights 2, night harder
4711000	4713000	99 Nights 2, Electric Boogaloo
4715000	4717000	Singularity
4717000	4719000	on Playstation 3, Xbox 360
4719000	4721000	and PC
4721000	4723000	might call that Time Shift 2
4723000	4725000	The
4725000	4727000	Last Airbender, the game
4727000	4729000	based off the movie, based off the
4729000	4731000	anime, based off
4731000	4733000	another game, no
4733000	4735000	that's on DS and Wii
4735000	4737000	I'm sure it's going to be so much better than the
4737000	4739000	you know, the ones based
4739000	4741000	off the animated series
4741000	4743000	the twist is not
4743000	4745000	Sniper Ghost Warrior
4745000	4747000	on PC and Xbox 360
4747000	4749000	Sniper Ghost Warrior?
4749000	4751000	Yes
4751000	4753000	Sniper Ghost Warrior
4753000	4755000	It's not like a sci-fi movie
4755000	4757000	starring, you know, Debbie Gibson
4757000	4759000	I'm sorry, Deborah Gibson and Tiffany
4759000	4761000	They're like ghosts because they hide
4761000	4763000	in the shadows and snipe you in the head
4763000	4765000	I gotta start that tangent again
4765000	4767000	about why they need to make games out of sci-fi movies
4767000	4769000	because did you hear the one this week about
4769000	4771000	Debbie Gibson and Tiffany being in a movie?
4771000	4773000	Together?
4773000	4775000	I saw that article and I was just like
4775000	4777000	I don't care
4777000	4779000	You know what though? I do agree
4779000	4781000	with you because cheesy games do
4781000	4783000	end up being
4783000	4785000	pretty cool, which is why
4785000	4787000	once again I must
4787000	4789000	urge you D3
4789000	4791000	publishing, bring over the
4791000	4793000	simple series. Come on
4793000	4795000	you know you wanna
4795000	4797000	and I know Oni Chumbara didn't really do that well
4797000	4799000	over here, but Earth Defense Force 2017
4799000	4801000	is so awesome! All you need to do
4801000	4803000	is remake the second game. I know the
4803000	4805000	second game was almost the first game
4805000	4807000	all over again and the third game was basically the
4807000	4809000	first game all over again, but
4809000	4811000	it's, you don't really need to do anything
4811000	4813000	all you need to do is put more levels
4813000	4815000	and they only have to be that different
4815000	4817000	just more levels, completely forget
4817000	4819000	the last games existed, add a few different
4819000	4821000	enemy types, I think you should make a
4821000	4823000	level editor in there, and four player co-op
4823000	4825000	and four player system link
4825000	4827000	or four player over live
4827000	4829000	Speaking of gold
4829000	4831000	speaking of Ludacris, you might like this Logie
4831000	4833000	I was listening to Bobby's show on the way over here
4833000	4835000	in the car, on the handy dandy all games
4835000	4837000	iPhone app, and he was
4837000	4839000	talking about risk factions, and I'm kind of
4839000	4841000	paraphrasing here because I haven't played the game myself
4841000	4843000	but he did, but he was talking about
4843000	4845000	how, you know, there's classic risk in there
4845000	4847000	where you can play as all the different countries and dah dah dah dah
4847000	4849000	but in one of the new modes, like a story mode
4849000	4851000	or whatever, like the different factions are like
4851000	4853000	humans, zombies
4853000	4855000	and cats
4855000	4857000	and robots
4857000	4859000	I'm like, this sounds awesome!
4859000	4861000	So, you can
4861000	4863000	lead an army of cats against an army
4863000	4865000	of zombies. Amazing!
4865000	4867000	So we need more cheesy games
4867000	4869000	like, uh, Tachyon
4869000	4871000	starring Bruce Campbell. President cat, hello
4871000	4873000	whatever happened with that, don't think I even forgot
4873000	4875000	I mean, look at the symbol series over in Japan
4875000	4877000	on the Playstation 2, they've released
4877000	4879000	like a good 50 games
4879000	4881000	at least, in that series
4881000	4883000	you know, for like 20 bucks
4883000	4885000	they just take these really weird, independent
4885000	4887000	games, I guess, and then throw them out there
4887000	4889000	I mean, they have one with
4889000	4891000	versus with, you know, miniguns
4891000	4893000	you know, mowing down zombies
4893000	4895000	they have zombies versus ambulance
4895000	4897000	you drive an ambulance and you run over
4897000	4899000	zombies, it's awesome
4899000	4901000	and then, you know, there's actually a lot of games
4901000	4903000	with zombies now that I think of it
4903000	4905000	for the simple series, because there's only
4905000	4907000	Chambara, which is basically you fighting zombies
4907000	4909000	with a samurai sword and a chick wearing a bikini and a cowboy hat
4909000	4911000	but Earth Defense Force
4911000	4913000	is so awesome though
4913000	4915000	it's an incredible game
4915000	4917000	and I really want to go back and play the Playstation 2
4917000	4919000	version of Earth Defense Force 2
4919000	4921000	because they have like a chick with a jet pack
4921000	4923000	you can fly around as
4923000	4925000	they have these different
4925000	4927000	different looking characters
4927000	4929000	I mean, they're the same
4929000	4931000	they have the robot types and the UFOs and stuff like that
4931000	4933000	but the one robot type in there
4933000	4935000	kind of looks like a tripod from War of the Worlds
4935000	4937000	and that's really cool!
4937000	4939000	and it's just, the whole point is cheesy stuff
4939000	4941000	even like, you know
4941000	4943000	Zombies Ate My Neighbors
4943000	4945000	a perfect example of how you can make a game that's cheesy
4945000	4947000	that parodies a bunch of like, you know
4947000	4949000	old sci-fi horror movies
4949000	4951000	I think it's a great idea
4951000	4953000	but anyways, we're getting on a tangent here
4953000	4955000	so
4955000	4957000	O.S. we do!
4957000	4959000	More stuff coming up this week
4959000	4961000	Fallen Earth Blood Sports on PC
4961000	4963000	Kind of wonder, what sports
4963000	4965000	are they playing in Fallen Earth?
4965000	4967000	I don't know
4967000	4969000	It doesn't say
4969000	4971000	I think it's an expansion
4971000	4973000	Uninterested
4973000	4975000	Missed on DS
4975000	4977000	I'm guessing that must be re-released
4977000	4979000	because I could have sworn that's been released before
4979000	4981000	or maybe it's a different publisher now
4981000	4983000	but if you haven't picked that up
4983000	4985000	you can pick it up now
4985000	4987000	play a game that's really, really old
4987000	4989000	Let's see
4989000	4991000	What other fun stuff do we have here?
4991000	4993000	Oh yeah, Just Sing
4993000	4995000	with microphone for the DS
4995000	4997000	so you can sing karaoke
4997000	4999000	on your DS
4999000	5001000	Not quite
5001000	5003000	Different company
5003000	5005000	I wonder if you can sing
5005000	5007000	Brew
5007000	5009000	Naughty Bear
5009000	5011000	on Playstation 3
5011000	5013000	There's a lot of those in San Francisco
5013000	5015000	Did you see the trailer for that?
5015000	5017000	That looks like fun!
5017000	5019000	No, I haven't seen it
5019000	5021000	I'll YouTube it right now
5021000	5023000	It's like Hitman with teddy bears
5023000	5025000	You're trying to get revenge on all the other teddy bears
5025000	5027000	in the village
5027000	5029000	and the whole point is to be as evil as possible
5029000	5031000	you have an evil meter
5031000	5033000	or a naughty meter
5033000	5035000	and you can kill them but you get more points
5035000	5037000	for torturing them and being witnessed
5037000	5039000	torturing them
5039000	5041000	So it's Overlord with teddy bears
5041000	5043000	It's beautiful
5043000	5045000	It's horrible and beautiful at the same time
5045000	5047000	I love it
5047000	5049000	Oh wait, this is an ad
5049000	5051000	fucking YouTube, hold on
5051000	5053000	Crackdown 2
5053000	5055000	is an excellent game that will be coming out next week
5055000	5057000	on the 6th
5057000	5059000	I want Naughty Bear
5059000	5061000	But it's way better than Naughty Bear, sadly
5061000	5063000	Naughty Bear though, you can set traps for them
5063000	5065000	Do you know how much fucking traffic
5065000	5067000	those naughty bears caused in San Francisco today?
5067000	5069000	I had to go around
5069000	5071000	Oh, here we go
5071000	5073000	360
5073000	5075000	Shut up
5081000	5083000	This is quality radio ladies and gentlemen
