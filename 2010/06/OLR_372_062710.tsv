19352	22497	14 from showing up on 360, the classic PC game showing
32014	36777	Hello, my friends on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36837	42121	We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
42141	42481	You know what?
42561	46463	It is that show, as we say, where every gamer has a voice.
46904	49045	And joining me over the next three hours, say hello.
49105	50586	Oh, my name is Rob Roberts, in case you didn't know.
50826	54689	Joining me over the next few hours, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55029	55449	Hi.
55589	55950	How are you?
56590	57071	Hi.
57331	58152	Happy birthday.
58553	59154	Yay.
59254	59895	Happy birthday.
59935	60475	We're old.
60576	60936	Yay.
61357	64201	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
64841	65242	Hi.
65422	66304	Happy birthday.
67537	68318	It's not my birthday.
68418	69779	Well, it's the show's birthday.
70279	70379	Oh.
70579	75183	Orange Lounge Radio turned eight years old this week on June the 23rd was our first show.
76144	76704	So there you go.
77365	78946	That's why I'm saying happy birthday to everybody.
79466	83850	Now, I did have an actual birthday yesterday, but we don't talk about that because I really am old.
84590	86111	I'm four times the age of the show.
86231	87853	Who's older than you in this room?
88813	89074	Me.
89974	90555	So shut up.
91455	91695	All right.
92316	98198	Anyhow, let's go ahead and introduce tonight a special guest we have here in studio.
98238	104040	A very special, I almost said spatial guest because he takes up space, as he usually does here on this show.
104740	105941	We always give him a hard time.
105961	107301	He takes up less space than each of us.
107461	107962	Actually, yes.
108022	109602	He's actually a skinny motherfucker.
109642	110663	I hate him for it, but that's okay.
111423	111783	Say hello.
111823	112984	He has not been here in...
114324	115365	Thanks for watching!
129394	129554	23rd Magus
159304	161826	Well, there's all these little in-jokes that go with Drew Nami.
162447	166230	Because you used to come to the show a lot back in the heyday.
166731	173577	We all played DDR and all those arrow stomping and arm waving and button mashing and all those fun music games we used to play back in the day.
173897	179282	But I gotta say, I don't know if you heard, but there's more than 12 people listening to Orange Lounge Radio now.
179362	180743	It's really... No!
180783	181404	I know, right?
181424	181764	Really?
182004	182945	Who would have thought, right?
182965	183005	So...
184346	187969	Catch up some of the people who've never heard you on this program before.
188029	189170	What kind of games do you play?
189250	193133	What are you into, and why are you here on this show?
193494	202781	Well, I'm still kind of the big Bomani buff, although that's kind of waned a bit in the past couple of years since, you know, the genre's kind of waned.
204082	206684	I'm the RPG, the MMO buff.
207245	207365	Um...
208971	212454	If it's Square, if it's Bioware, I've probably played it.
214156	215918	I just play a very diverse set of games.
217099	220582	You must be looking very much forward to that new Star Wars game that's by Bioware.
221863	222644	It's an MMO.
223224	223925	The Old Republic?
224666	225566	The new one.
225626	226147	What's the new one?
226327	227068	I can't even remember.
227088	228269	Star Wars The Old Republic.
228409	228669	Is it?
228749	229190	Okay.
229610	231272	A lot of people say it's going to be a WoW killer.
231612	234635	Me, as the kind of WoW addict, I say no.
235015	237036	Why does there have to be a WoW killer?
237176	244540	I mean, yes, I realize 11 million people are subscribed to WoW, but, you know, there's a lot more people on the planet.
244740	245380	You know what I mean?
245420	250022	Like, I don't think WoW is going to die by the hands of one game.
250702	252703	It may die by the hands of itself one day.
253043	256625	Well, I'll get into that later because I'm really, really mad at WoW this week.
256845	257325	Really mad.
257566	259887	The Roman Empire was responsible for its own destruction.
261007	262408	And who cares about EverQuest anymore?
263118	270526	There's going to come a day where WoW is going to have to go through a major overhaul to stay current.
271247	273569	And sometimes these overhauls are not received very well.
273589	274270	But I don't know.
274590	277373	I don't want to get too far off topic because it's too much crystal ball.
278054	284341	Well, a lot of people just don't juggle multiple MMOs and I think the markets sort of reach in saturation if you ask me.
284941	297644	Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and look at some comments as you folks chat live with us because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
297724	298984	He's on at about 5 Pacific.
299064	303125	We're on at about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, but sometimes we run late.
303445	304246	It's just a deal.
304566	313948	All right, but we're here taping live, so please, if you're listening live to us on All Games, join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
314608	318731	Okay, Ziba in our chatroom says, every new MMO is said to be the WoW killer.
319351	322573	Remember when Warhammer Online was going to be the WoW killer?
323153	325555	Remember when Ion was going to be the WoW killer?
325595	327516	Remember when Eve was supposed to be the WoW killer?
328437	330158	Eve still has a pretty strong cult following.
330478	334580	Yeah, but it's still very niche.
334600	335321	Star Trek Online always.
335341	339403	I was going to say, here we have Jamie, and her thing is Star Trek Online.
339724	340344	And it was Ragnarok.
340703	345727	And I think Star Trek Online is a good example Does it have as many people as WoW?
346067	349390	No But is it probably doing successful for itself?
349830	364721	Sure It's probably making money I doubt Star Trek Online took all these people away from WoW I think it kind of carved itself to a new audience that maybe wasn't playing WoW before Like Jamie, Jamie quit WoW before STO was out
364901	374491	Well, it just seems to me that WoW is sort of like... Remember when we discussed Guitar Hero versus, say, Beatmania?
375392	379837	It brought accessibility to the genre, brought it into the mainstream.
381138	387204	A lot of MMOs are kind of following the WoW formula, so to speak, or incorporating, and vice versa.
387845	405475	There were so many people when Guitar Hero first came out, especially the group listening to this show that grew up on the Bomani games that were like, freaking rip-off of Guitar Freaks, this is just a stupid rip-off, and Guitar Freaks is better, and the music's better in Guitar Freaks, well, okay.
405575	410558	And then when Beatmania US finally came out, reviews called it a rip-off of Guitar Hero.
410618	411879	Well, that was ignorant.
412259	416965	I mean, that was just straight up written by an intern, ignorant intern that should never... Ignant.
417445	417765	Ignant.
418406	421189	Ignant intern that should never... That's an insult to interns everywhere.
421229	421770	I digress.
421790	422050	Sorry.
422531	423852	Sorry, Drew Nami, but, you know.
424273	424993	But I digress.
425314	431821	The thing is, is that Guitar Hero, you hit the nail on the head, succeeded where Guitar Freaks failed because...
432622	437627	and Harmonix, who was the developer at the time, took a risk, a huge risk, and made it accessible.
437887	439628	Konami, too stubborn to take risks.
440529	443111	And I still say that's the case with them to an extent today.
443352	444373	Too stubborn to take risks.
446094	446374	Anyhow.
447636	448857	Wow, fun show already.
448877	449757	We haven't gotten into the news.
450098	451599	Let's start off with how was your gaming week?
451619	453181	We always like to talk about the games we've been playing.
453461	455463	Ladies first, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
456864	458345	Well, it was...
459600	463181	I don't know, it actually wasn't too bad, because I have a DSi now.
464302	466283	I will not say how we acquired such a thing.
466843	467243	Huzzah!
467403	467943	You stole it.
468283	468824	Killed a hobo.
469704	470884	Killed a hobo, exactly.
472705	475686	So, I've actually started Back Into The World Is Not Enough.
475706	477067	It's a cool game.
477688	477948	Awesome.
478049	478749	Oh, yeah.
478789	479911	I've heard a lot of neat things about that.
479931	480892	I haven't spent a lot of time with that myself.
480912	481593	The world is not enough.
481633	482714	That was a Bond movie.
482734	483455	The world ends with you.
483475	484617	The world ends with you.
484877	486959	Because, well, I'll tell you what my brain did.
487480	489142	Okay, here's an insight into how my brain works.
489703	490684	I said, the world is not enough.
490704	493027	Then my brain went, that's not right because that spells out twine.
494849	495189	What game?
495209	495449	What?
496130	497330	I just think of the garbage song.
497531	498371	That's how my mind works.
498411	499712	I think of the song from the James Bond movie.
499732	500613	The world is not enough.
500673	501734	T-W-I-N-E.
501814	502234	Yeah, I get it.
502274	502754	T-Wine.
503075	504896	So I was like Twine.
505336	508338	Like the biggest ball of Twine in... No, that wasn't it.
508499	510320	That's the cycle that my brain went through.
510620	515103	And then that's when I realized I was playing Sam and Max.
515123	516324	The world ends with you.
516725	518606	That's when I realized Joshua is still an asshole.
519082	522325	and I started actually trying to play Oendon again.
522485	523846	Which spells out Tiwe.
526989	531372	So, also we've been watching the Mario Marathon because that's super awesome.
532373	542701	And I've also been sending Dan YouTube videos of this guy playing a bunch of brass instruments, you know, re-recording himself, doing like the Mario 64 theme and playing the euphonium, which is one of my favorite instruments.
543782	544503	I just like to say it, euphonium.
544523	544903	Euphonium.
548455	550036	That's really about... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
550096	550856	I played some Portal.
552076	553497	I lusted over Portal 2 some more.
554998	558159	And... Oh, yeah, lots... I love your description.
558399	560600	I lusted over Portal 2.
562080	566862	And I played a crap... It can sound like you're watching YouTubes and your tongue is on the floor.
568163	569763	That's not what you do when you lust Rob.
569803	570284	So pretty.
571284	574766	Anyway, and I played a crap ton of Star Trek Online.
574786	580130	I played enough Star Trek Online in two days to get from Commander 2 to Commander 7.
581911	584932	Because you have ten ranks in each rank.
585633	587754	So I'm three ranks away from Captain.
588034	588655	Many ranks.
589315	591438	Captain before my surgery Captain before my surgery
603123	606304	Let's talk about your surgery for a minute because it's going to impact the show coming up.
606364	606865	Oh, shit.
606925	607265	That's right.
607285	608165	Well, we don't have to, you know.
608245	608785	No, we can tell.
608805	609165	It's fine.
609526	612207	Well, you're going to be having surgery, what, on the hand again, right?
612347	612527	Yes.
613827	614828	I will be a little technical here.
615088	615328	Okay.
615348	616168	I have trigger finger.
617849	619430	It's also called flexor tendonitis.
619490	621270	I have it in my middle two fingers on my right hand.
621730	624432	And if you want to really know what the surgery goes into, just look it up online.
624472	626212	I'll post something in the chat room and gross everybody out.
626272	630414	But I was awake during my last one, and I don't really care about my new one because I'll be awake through that, too.
630774	632135	I'm just glad I get my benefits.
633792	634592	No, insurance.
635072	637873	Seriously, healthcare is the big hot issue here.
638514	642075	And thankfully, I'll be on FMLA during the layoffs at my company.
643195	646937	So I will still have employment at my old company and still have benefits.
647857	648557	And then I get laid off.
648617	649538	Work that system.
649618	650098	Work it.
650538	651398	And then I get laid off.
652179	655040	So, hire me, I'm a designer.
657400	675307	So, the whole thing about this though is that basically they're going to cut up, they're going to flame my hand at the palm and cut the tendon sheaths around the middle two fingers and then leave it open because what's going to happen is there's a big knotting there and it's going to grow over the knotting so that the swelling will go down.
676187	678889	and as a result, I won't be able to use my right hand for at least a week.
679189	680850	And it'll be replaced by a monkey paw.
681891	682311	No.
683192	685573	Although, actually, a chimpanzee would be cool.
685613	688415	She really will be Jamie Summers because they're going to give her a bionic arm.
689636	690617	I want a bionic hand.
690637	692318	Will you be able to go go-go gadget finger?
694880	697922	Isn't his middle finger the water pistol one?
699162	699423	Yes.
699843	700944	Damn it, Rob, you stole my joke.
702395	707537	But no, um, so I'm gonna go in and have my hand flayed open by a specialist.
707918	708338	Ooh.
709738	712660	And I will- They have specialists that flay hands?
712880	713400	Yes, they do.
713600	714821	I wanna be that specialist.
715461	718362	So, um, I will be here for the show.
718542	725806	I just will be very slow with, uh, you know, probably will not be hanging out in the chat room, or I might be in the chat room just, you know, ghosting, but-
726626	728066	Slamming down random keys.
728226	731747	And the best thing about it is Vicodin.
731987	737028	It'll sound like a Zaku call when he doesn't stop typing on the keyboard.
737468	739848	Jamie's slamming her monkey paw down on the keyboard.
740309	741589	She's communicating.
741849	743089	One thump means she's angry.
743109	744029	What I want is chimp fingers.
745369	746910	Or like orangutan fingers.
746930	750490	They're really long ones that I can grab things and poke holes in fruit.
752611	753551	But the best part is drugs.
754812	756033	That's always the best part of a surgery.
756313	760036	I will be probably on Vicodin because they don't really care if you hurt or not.
760056	762418	They just want you to not care that you hurt and that's what Vicodin does.
762458	764619	Be sure to play tons of video games while you're on drugs.
766101	766681	Okay, get this.
766761	769163	Last time I had my surgery, do you know what I was doing two days later?
769723	772726	Playing Blue Dragon all night.
772846	773947	Did you think the game was good?
774347	775228	I love Blue Dragon.
775508	776068	There you go.
776209	777109	It's like playing a Dreamcast game.
777129	778070	See what drugs do.
778410	782654	Hey, I liked it because it was like playing a Dreamcast game.
784415	794556	by the way, I also cleaned out a closet today in this preparation for not being able to do any housework and I found my Dreamcast shirt and a crap ton of stuff that I'm sending to our buddy Rob in England
795319	796099	Wasn't that nice of you?
796540	796700	Yes.
796740	797980	All right, so no show July 4th.
798000	799141	You send me dirty cards every year.
799741	802982	No show July 4th because that is the day that America celebrates fire.
803423	805744	So we're, I mean, that's a very important holiday to us.
805764	808825	And we're having a block party for my neighborhood on the 3rd, so you totally have to come.
809225	810366	Oh, we just might, actually.
810706	812547	So we got that going on.
812787	815888	But then come July 11th, Orange Lounge Radio will be back.
815908	816228	You said it.
816469	819310	And it'll be something like this when Orange Lounge Radio is back on the 11th.
828954	838100	Orange Lounge Radio, starring Rob Roberts, Loki, and featuring... No, no, no, no.
838120	839481	See, Rob.
839601	840722	You have to do the right thing.
840742	842203	You have to play the bionic level.
845245	847847	And you know that's seriously what I got my name after?
848387	848788	No, I know.
848928	849148	I know.
850028	858034	See, totally... I want to be all bionic and have the little string quartet follow me around every time I run.
860171	860711	Thank you for watching!
873129	873449	All right.
874609	878350	Spyro's in our chat room saying, even though I'm British, I still celebrate the 4th.
882031	883891	Stick it to the king!
884952	887472	No, that's kind of like feeding a cow a hamburger, but okay.
888312	888592	All right.
889553	890793	It's double the beef.
890933	891293	Why?
891493	893053	You know, that's what caused mad cow disease.
893714	893994	I bet.
894034	894234	All right.
894354	894854	Are you mad?
895314	895574	No.
895794	896694	Then you're fit for food.
897034	899175	Occasionally on this program, we talk about video games.
899295	900375	Loki, how was your gaming week?
901823	912248	It was okay, I actually played some different stuff this week because I am being forced to sit on a jury Oh crap, did you get picked?
912608	921893	I got picked Joke's on them actually Alright, we're gonna ask you all about the case when it's done, it's still going right?
923401	923861	Yeah.
923901	925122	Okay, so I know you can't talk about it.
925742	931465	Well, I can't, but... Actually, you want to get dismissed real quick?
931505	932786	Here's your form.
932846	933627	No, you better not.
933867	935347	That's not dismiss, that's contempt.
936708	939810	When they're doing the interview, she'll go, I support killing them!
940530	943293	That's okay because Inspector Gadget can get you out of jail.
943614	950862	It wouldn't be so bad if it was a criminal trial, but no, it's a civil trial.
950922	954366	In other words, somebody is mad and so they're suing for money.
955787	956768	And that's what's going on.
958088	962490	I kid you not, I couldn't roll my eyes more than at this trial.
962830	969253	And on top of that, the prosecution lawyer is an idiot who talks like Andy Griffith and it's hilarious.
970233	973254	So is the case anything like this when you're in the courtroom?
973554	979817	Like, you know, you'll just kind of be sitting there and then, you know, now the prosecution is going to call a witness to the stand.
982862	983563	Thanks for watching!
1002714	1007296	and a loudspeaker PA system because they were confused.
1007576	1012998	Or I should say the prosecution lawyer was confused and we were falling asleep.
1014098	1015739	Then we finally had our afternoon break.
1015779	1022902	We all walked out into the hallway and just kind of looked at each other and shook our heads like, this is going to last until November.
1023902	1024883	Great.
1024943	1027024	You got the lawyer who watched too much Matlock.
1027844	1028384	Oh my God.
1028424	1030805	The guy is like, it's seriously Andy Griffith.
1032935	1033955	Get his autograph for me.
1033975	1038437	He introduced himself as, okay, I'm going to screw up people's names.
1038677	1039677	I'm going to forget things.
1039837	1041057	I'm going to repeat stuff.
1041497	1044598	I'm going to get confused.
1044818	1046599	But don't hold that against my client.
1047579	1049459	How much did you pay for this guy?
1049720	1051140	Hey, at least he's modest.
1051300	1052220	Tiger Claw wants to know.
1052240	1052900	Probably court appointed.
1053100	1056241	Tiger Claw in our chat room wants to know if the case is a little more like night court.
1059902	1062063	I'd say it's more night court than law and order.
1063402	1064849	Oh god, look out for Bull Great
1070367	1075671	So we've got Inspector Gadget, we've got Night Court, I don't know, I dread what might be coming for me, but that's alright.
1076071	1097126	Anyways, so because I've had to endure court, I've been playing a lot of stuff on my DS, including Peggle Nights, which is pretty fun, and of course some Planet Puzzle League, and I actually played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 2.
1098607	1115257	Chinatown Wars, but I gotta say man, Chinatown Wars, I just don't dig the 2D, well not really 2D, the top down old school Grand Theft Auto stuff I mean, once you've been spoiled by number 3 and beyond, it's just, why go back?
1116378	1122021	I will admit, I don't think I ever played more DS than when I had Jury Duty, so I feel ya
1122876	1124356	And it's just so terrible.
1124536	1129178	Because I have to go there at like 7 in the morning to get a parking spot.
1129598	1136780	Because our jury parking lot is in downtown Sacramento where there's no parking.
1136840	1142021	Because there are dickholes that don't provide adequate parking for the jury.
1142101	1144382	So you have to get there that early in order to get parking.
1144762	1147823	And then our trial doesn't actually start until 9 a.m.
1147923	1148783	So I'm sitting there...
1149423	1150284	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1170862	1175285	Um, okay, but anyways, other than that, um, I've been playing more Grand Theft Auto, of course.
1175706	1184632	Uh, I made back, I guess, um, the ranks that I lost from playing some sloppy games.
1185272	1193137	Um, I've been taking it on my coworkers, so I've been beating the crap out of them very viciously, uh, quadrupling their scores at times.
1193858	1193978	Um...
1195139	1221220	and then what else Earth Defense Force 2017 because that game is still fun finished the the hardest difficulty on that so it's fun so we're going backwards now playing around the Genocide Gun and then I actually played a little bit of the Crackdown 2 demo hopefully going to be playing the full game by the end of this week I just have to convince them to give me my copy because they've been sitting on it for two weeks and
1223001	1223962	But yeah, it's pretty fun.
1223982	1231347	And Crackdown 2, pretty much just like you remember the first one, it's kind of cool if you've actually played the first game, you'll recognize a lot of the stuff in the game.
1231647	1234609	A lot of the locations are very similar, if not the same.
1235029	1240173	In fact, I was just kind of walking around going, wow, hey, I recognize, oh my god, I wonder if this is here from the first game.
1240253	1241153	Oh yeah, it is, there it is.
1242294	1242994	So that's kind of fun.
1243355	1245536	And the game itself, you know, pretty cool.
1246016	1249999	So I can't wait to pick that up and actually play some maybe co-op online and whatnot.
1252162	1253625	but yeah, that's pretty much it for right now
1255539	1257661	Let's see my gaming week then if we move on to me.
1258641	1260022	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
1260122	1261683	I'm still making my way through Alan Wake.
1262084	1263004	One of these days I'll beat it.
1264025	1268668	But I did spend quite a bit of time on WoW this week, you know, addict, which I'll come back to in a minute.
1269268	1279655	I also played a little bit of Game Room because, you know, I love me some classic games, and one of my all-time favorite classic games came out on Game Room this week, H-E-R-O, from the Atari 2600.
1279735	1284819	Now, I played this a little more on the Commodore 64 with the slightly better graphics, but, you know, it's still the same game I remember.
1285439	1290242	In a nutshell, the H-E-R-O, it's helicopter rescue operation, basically.
1290782	1295465	And you play this little guy that has a helicopter on his back, and it's this cute little control mechanism.
1295485	1303289	And you kind of explore caves, but in the cave there are monsters and lava and all these things you have to avoid, and sometimes boats that you take.
1303789	1307431	Actually, for a 2600 game, it was pretty darn impressive.
1307491	1309512	I mean, they really packed a lot into the cartridge.
1310433	1313795	I would kind of compare it to, like, imagine if you could fly around in Pitfall.
1314255	1342780	it's kind of like that because you know Pitfall was an Activision game too but it was one of my favorite games that came out for the 2600 but it came out right before the big crash so I think a lot of people missed this game but it's on Game Room now and you know it's worth at least checking out the demo and see if you like it I tried to get a top 20 score but I found it was very scary how much I remembered like go down through the left tunnel instead of the right tunnel or go down the third passage like I actually remembered how to get through a lot of levels it kind of freaked me out so yeah there was that that was fun
1343755	1344035	Oh, thank God.
1372582	1373767	I liked the Dungeon Finder.
1378095	1407015	It sprays diarrhea all over World of Warcraft It was a terrible content patch And I'll tell you why For one, now the game crashes every so often now If you have souped up settings on your computer The draw distance it can't handle Like my game crashes every now and then And the Ruby Sanctum I guess was released But it's not even open yet They can't open it until they get the patch deployed to everyone else They released this thing called Real ID
1408484	1416678	Real ID is what allows you to cross communicate through servers, through factions to other players that you want to communicate with.
1416718	1417619	That's what I thought it was.
1418559	1422280	It's kind of their way of being Xbox Live or Steam, I guess.
1422460	1431284	Well, you know that Battle.net's kind of slowly trying to kind of poke at the Steam and the... Actually, I would say it's most... You know what most reminds me of is X-Fire.
1431304	1432444	I don't know if you remember X-Fire.
1432964	1438026	But the whole way Battle.net's going really reminds me of what X-Fire kind of was or is, I guess.
1438086	1438946	I guess they're still going.
1439166	1443368	Well, they kind of want to integrate the StarCraft 2 players that are going to be coming up with the WoW players.
1443848	1445809	But Real ID, here's the thing.
1446784	1454012	Real ID allows you to communicate with players on any server and on any faction while you're still in WoW.
1454112	1454833	So that's cool.
1455814	1457676	But it doesn't use handles.
1458517	1459398	It doesn't use numbers.
1460499	1463563	It uses your real name to communicate with other people.
1465137	1465938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1490427	1491867	Here's what I'm not okay with.
1492348	1495868	And this is where I truly feel like Blizzard hijacked my privacy this week.
1496769	1507151	Is that they copied a feature from Xbox Live where you can view your friends list and you can go into any of your friends and view their friends list.
1507732	1509452	Complete with their real name.
1510732	1516174	So in other words, if I add a friend on this Battle.net system...
1517561	1544993	somebody that might be trying to find out my real name because I don't know if it's a big secret or what have you but I don't use my real name on this program neither does Jamie Loki obviously isn't his real name either you know we use fake names on the show just like a lot of people do out there in the world like you know Bono that's not his real name Cher is probably a shortened name Madonna really is her name but you know it's you know what I mean Cher is actually Cher's name
1545553	1547795	And I'm not trying to, well, but it's a shortened, she goes by one.
1547815	1549136	I thought she was Esther now.
1549717	1550077	Forget it.
1551078	1554241	My point is, there's a lot of people out there that don't use their real names, and we don't either.
1554881	1561106	And, you know what, I actually thank Travis, back from Under Sedation Live, for making me use a fake name, because it's been really good.
1561687	1565430	And I don't like my day job and my night job to conflict.
1565630	1573617	It's nothing personal, you guys, but just realize, I have a day job where I, privacy is a huge component of my day job.
1574497	1589024	and I can't have my what I do during the day and what I do during the night conflict with each other and like if that were to happen I couldn't do this show anymore because I have to pay my bills you know what I mean this show pays me nothing so I realize that most people are pretty respectful of that
1590523	1591344	Battle.net
1605880	1613646	I can't control adding you as a friend, but I can't control who you put on your friends list.
1613866	1615327	Well, I'm not going to put anybody on there.
1615827	1616568	You don't understand.
1617288	1621992	You might think that, and you might know that, but there's some really messed up people in the world.
1623673	1628096	I, many years ago, because of this program, had a stalker.
1628717	1630398	I had a stalker because of Orange Lounge Radio.
1631513	1632334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1661738	1662258	DarkSakura.com
1687307	1710301	that's that that's what I'm talking about and so I I am totally with you guys if you don't like it don't use it and I don't use it because I don't want that to happen ever again but the problem is it's there and now there's these social pressures and I'm hearing like guilds out there are requiring people to use it that is so screwed up here's my point Blizzard is smarter than that
1711101	1711542	Bet your ass.
1711582	1712302	Bet your ass.
1734301	1739444	Think, when you were 16 or 17, did your parents know how to totally control your gaming?
1739464	1740664	Because I'll tell you, mine sure didn't.
1740924	1742885	And it definitely wasn't because they were bad parents.
1743406	1745867	It was just because I knew computers more than they did.
1747428	1750049	I was playing Nintendo with my mom.
1750790	1759374	And so if World of Warcraft had been around when I was 16, I guarantee you I would be on Battle.net using real ID with my mom's name.
1760314	1763655	That's... Like, I'm like, this is, like, incredibly messed up.
1763895	1770197	So, basically, Blizzard failed to account for the stupidity and maliciousness of its players.
1770578	1770818	Mm-hmm.
1771658	1774459	Sorry, potential stupidity and maliciousness of its players.
1774919	1776199	Guilds requiring that?
1777360	1778860	Yeah, I've heard... That is insane!
1779280	1784222	Because they want to know if you're, like, online and to rate... It's these really stupid reasons.
1784482	1786783	Do not join a guild that requires you to use real ID.
1786863	1788564	I mean, that's just... That's just, like...
1790865	1817942	or you can do what I do and don't play World of Warcraft so Star Trek Online, they don't require you to have that stuff I know, I'm trying to look at some of the comments in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join in Salacious Pop says it only takes one person in an IRL guild to add random pickup people to ruin it for everybody else they know that's true, you know, I can control my own list but I can't control my friends list and that's what I really don't like about Real ID
1818402	1827588	So honestly, I understand Blizzard, in a boardroom somewhere, must have thought this was a good idea to combat, I don't know, gold sellers or something.
1828989	1829390	You know what?
1829450	1831151	No, I can't think of why this is a good idea.
1831231	1831771	I really can't.
1832572	1833753	Well, hopefully they'll tone that down.
1834344	1846530	I realize we have people, and I'm surprised every week at who is actually listening to Orange Lounge Radio, because like, didn't we have a guy email or call that was like, oh yeah, I worked at Infinity Ward, you know, I was there, I was like, really?
1847531	1849431	I didn't know we had people that worked there to listen to the show.
1850172	1858596	If we have anyone that works at Act of Blizzard that listens to this program, will you please, please help us get this fixed?
1859276	1862558	Because it is just an embarrassment to World of Warcraft right now.
1863194	1870439	You know, it makes about as much sense as locking down your Facebook privacy settings, and I think they need to do the same thing.
1870499	1880165	I know they tried to make Battle.net a little more social, a little more Facebook-like, but they stumbled on the same problem that Facebook had.
1880445	1881006	Privacy.
1881266	1884008	Seeing friends of friends that you might not want to see.
1884388	1888391	I mean, I keep my Facebook locked down tighter than a frog's ass for a reason.
1889431	1893694	Well, yeah, if they want to go the Facebook route, though, Facebook lets me change my name.
1893954	1898237	I use my radio name on Facebook because I actually don't want to date people to find out my name.
1898297	1899318	It's just crazy.
1899338	1907163	I don't want to say it's a dual life I live because I have one life, but I'm just very conscious about my internet trail, and I think you have to be in this day and age.
1907423	1910425	And I find the easiest way to separate your internet trail is to use two names.
1911006	1912767	It's very easy when you do it that way.
1913007	1914788	Well, you know, actually, I am going to tell you this.
1914808	1918711	The reason why I leave my actual name up there is because I'm looking to get hired.
1919371	1921413	Right, and I don't need that right now.
1921433	1922334	I'm marketing myself.
1923435	1927239	Everyone's got their own reasons for it.
1927719	1934345	But you know, Facebook has this thing in their little rules or whatever that says if they find out that you're using a pseudonym that they can't delete your account.
1936528	1941930	So anyway, TigerClaw in chat says, if Blizzard listens to this show, they need to pay attention.
1941990	1943310	Sky is their biggest customer.
1944550	1953473	I appreciate the sentiment, and usually I'm one of the biggest proponents of Blizzard, but people that actually get suckered into going to BlizzCon are much bigger customers than I am.
1953773	1955994	And yes, I think you're kind of a sucker if you go to BlizzCon.
1956234	1961736	And there's people I know and love that go to BlizzCon, and it's, you know, it's just my personal feeling.
1962176	1966017	Well, and that's the whole thing, is that, you know, it's not like Blizzard doesn't get enough money out of you.
1966497	1970058	Why don't you come attend for $150 this three-day commercial?
1970578	1970958	No, thanks.
1970998	1972759	I'd like to be able to afford your next expansion.
1973199	1973679	Exactly.
1973899	1974359	Exactly.
1974399	1976220	That's what BlizzCon basically rolls down to.
1976260	1977740	I'd rather just play your damn game.
1977900	1978220	Anyhow.
1978340	1978561	Anyhow.
1978661	1981141	I'm getting way off topic and there's people that really don't want to hear this whole spiel.
1981521	1987183	But I'm just saying, I think this is important to talk about for a lot of different games.
1987283	1990944	Because, you know, Blizzard sets the standard with a lot of things.
1991324	1993745	This is one scary-ass standard I don't want them setting.
1994205	2015486	I don't complain about Xbox Live because I can change my name on Xbox Live I don't complain about Facebook because I can change my name on Facebook and I can lock it down to quote the ever eloquent Drunami tighter than a frog's ass I cannot change my name on Blizzard they hijacked it from my credit card without truly telling me what they would be using my name for and that was wrong that was wrong okay
2016687	2017747	Yay, rant's done.
2017767	2018248	Happy show.
2018288	2019628	Happy birthday, OLR.
2019648	2020949	Yay, happy show.
2021429	2023469	All right, Drew Nami, what have you been playing?
2023610	2025130	Oh, God, hell is my gaming year.
2025530	2027311	Well, yeah, in a nutshell, what have you been playing lately?
2027331	2029332	I've been playing a whole crap load of WoW lately.
2029372	2032313	I've actually been getting into the raiding scene, staying in the raiding scene.
2034033	2038355	Right now, I imagine Arthas is just sitting on his throne like Conan, looking bored.
2039575	2040336	RP Guild.
2041836	2052721	But I've also been taking advantage of a lot of Steam sales, I am a consumer whore and how I'm buying a hell of a lot of Steam games, playing a hell of a lot of Steam games Oh, have you seen the sale this week?
2052901	2064947	Oh god, I did take advantage of Left 4 Dead 2 Civ 4 is on sale again today No, I took advantage of Left 4 Dead 2 two days ago Yesterday, they cut the price in half
2065367	2066048	Don't you hate that?
2066248	2066968	And I raged.
2067268	2069170	Steve is like gambling sometimes.
2069390	2070531	And then I shot zombies.
2070771	2071291	Buy low.
2071992	2072913	Then I shot zombies.
2073613	2077176	I have been really getting into the Mass Effect series.
2077276	2079858	I played through Mass Effect 2 for the past couple months.
2080718	2083801	Love the hell out of it, waiting for the third game in the trilogy.
2084461	2087964	I gotta jump in here real quick because this is a very important question in chat I want to answer.
2088284	2095049	Blaze in our chatroom says, is this real ID nonsense going to be in StarCraft 2 and or more importantly to me at least, Diablo 3?
2096110	2096470	Yes.
2097831	2105657	So that's why even if you don't play WoW, Blizzard has a lock on some other PC gaming and I think it's important that you check that.
2106761	2107863	Check it out.
2108223	2109586	That's why they rushed this patch.
2109626	2112290	It's because StarCraft 2 is hitting shelves, what, next week?
2112370	2112991	July 27th.
2113211	2114533	Oh, I thought it was like July 7th.
2114573	2115755	Okay, but soon.
2115835	2116816	So they had to implement the patch.
2117017	2117798	Anyway, sorry, Drunami.
2117818	2121183	I just wanted to get that out there because it's a very important question that needed answering from our chat room.
2121673	2128077	So yeah, lots of Mass Effect 2, lots of Killing Fool, a very underrated first-person shooter.
2128117	2130559	It's no Left 4 Dead, but it's definitely underrated.
2132720	2136003	Console-wise, not a whole lot.
2137264	2141586	The new Tales Symphonia sequel was good, I've been replaying that.
2141967	2143628	Finally got around to beating No More Heroes.
2145040	2145740	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2162870	2165494	It had a lot of bugs for the PC port though.
2165654	2167717	The PC port wasn't very good.
2168258	2172924	Oh yeah, it was still a fun game, just not as fun.
2174727	2177030	I was playing Trine, not Twine, Trine.
2177711	2178632	Had a lot of fun with that.
2180914	2182695	I want your money as well Give it to me
2204031	2205072	Dan is here in studio.
2205152	2207253	We can't hear him because he's not on a mic, but that's okay.
2207433	2207953	How you doing, Dan?
2208534	2209935	Greetings.
2210155	2211756	Since you decided to bless our show.
2211796	2215398	I don't want to talk about games, but I want a moment of your show's time.
2215938	2224163	I want everyone to have a very, very brief moment of silence to mourn the passing of Game Crazy this week.
2225244	2228226	As of Wednesday, all Game Crazies will close down.
2228746	2229967	Wasn't Wednesday our birthday?
2230387	2231728	Leaving me super unemployed.
2232406	2233387	Wednesday was our birthday.
2233427	2234668	Happy birthday, LLR!
2234748	2235649	Happy birthday, LLR!
2235889	2237751	So, everybody, send me your money.
2240133	2241234	I'm not worried about identity.
2241254	2243175	If you want to send me some money, I'll just give you my name.
2243476	2244136	It's Rob.
2249181	2249701	Rob.
2250742	2251743	Send your money to Rob.
2251783	2252744	He'll get it to me.
2253044	2254625	Yes, send Rob your money.
2254866	2256827	I'll be sure Dan gets all of it.
2257348	2258609	Be sure to send cash.
2258959	2261661	because if you want his real name and address, what number of the works?
2261741	2262141	I got it.
2262261	2262922	Oh, shut up.
2263202	2264183	I will hook you up.
2265063	2267905	In related topics, Dan will never be added to Battle.net.
2268626	2269326	Every Sunday.
2269607	2271348	I know right where he's at.
2271508	2273469	I got this.
2273709	2277232	Now, Dan, you're ignoring OLR tonight to partake in the Mario Marathon, correct?
2278448	2279049	No, not really.
2279069	2283292	I mean, if I was ignoring all, I would be talking to you.
2283332	2284532	Well, you were a minute ago.
2284572	2286374	You were on the couch and watching Mario Marathon.
2286414	2287715	How's Mario Marathon going?
2288815	2290617	Those guys are not very good Mario players.
2291697	2292798	But it's for a good cause.
2292818	2293419	Okay, it's for a good cause.
2293719	2296101	We were actually sort of talking about that we should do something like that.
2296861	2297802	Except you play Sonic.
2298662	2300984	Except for, you know, something awesome.
2301380	2310086	Hey, TigerClaw's got a great suggestion in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com Maybe Dan can be on OLR more often now that he's jobless and he can tell game crazy stories.
2310486	2311667	I never worked on Sunday.
2312067	2313248	I just didn't want to talk to y'all.
2315189	2318612	I live with him, so I'm going to be on medical leave while he's off.
2319913	2324816	Oh my god, one of you two is going to kill the other because you're both not going to be working.
2326177	2327158	Yeah, tell me about it.
2328689	2358055	so anyways if anyone knows a job I don't care what it is I'll shovel crap I'll play Sega games whatever just give me your money that means you Andrew next week on next week on Orange Lounge Radio it's the Jamie and Dan household survivor Dan I know where you live only one of them can survive I know a fight to the death I know you know
2359195	2360976	We're going to do Paper Plate Battle Royale again.
2360996	2361756	What are you talking about?
2363036	2367858	By the way, I just saw something that makes me incredibly excited for my big DS9 fangirlism.
2369779	2374441	Episode 2 for Star Trek Online is going to be launching on July 15th.
2374981	2376882	They're including mini-games and one of them is Dabo.
2377802	2380243	Oh, Ranma in chat says Dan should apply to Best Buy.
2381403	2381923	Uh, no.
2382143	2384164	I was waiting for a comment from the living room.
2384864	2385465	Dan!
2387065	2387885	Are they hiring?
2387905	2392127	I don't think he values his soul that much.
2392387	2392507	Oh!
2392927	2393047	Oh!
2393427	2394788	Oh my god, Tigerclaw!
2395268	2395888	Brilliant!
2397048	2401430	Dan can try to sign in to be a contestant in the latest season of The Tester.
2402557	2405318	that show that they're casting for season two of The Tester.
2406019	2407119	Dan should go on The Tester.
2407399	2413562	Oh, you know, every other thing he says would be, you know, and I play this beep game, beep, beep, beep game, beep.
2414242	2415303	That's a brilliant idea.
2415443	2415883	Dan!
2415903	2417584	What?
2417644	2419544	You need to go on reality television.
2419564	2422266	I thought I was on reality television.
2422286	2424827	No, we're going to put you on season two of The Tester.
2425087	2427088	Yeah, I mean, you're on reality radio now.
2429116	2432639	No one listens to this show and no one watches The Tester.
2432679	2433840	It'll be a perfect transition.
2433880	2435221	Chirp, chirp.
2435281	2435882	Chirp, chirp.
2435902	2436362	Oh, Dan's back.
2436382	2436682	Hooray.
2436882	2437563	My yelling worked.
2438083	2440906	The Tester, you know that reality show on PlayStation Network?
2440946	2442107	Season 2 is coming up.
2442327	2443868	There's shows on PlayStation Network?
2443968	2444929	Yes, you could be.
2445089	2447451	Is PlayStation Network where you go on when you're not on Xbox Live?
2447471	2447711	Yes.
2447911	2450894	There's actually going to have this whole plus thing soon, too.
2450934	2451494	It's crazy.
2451594	2456699	The only reason I want to go on PlayStation Network is what is that new game that looks like Strider but it's four players?
2457864	2459365	I don't know, but it's amazing.
2459525	2462306	You could be a Sony game tester.
2464067	2465548	Sony games kind of suck.
2466888	2467749	Don't screw yourself.
2468329	2469950	$10,000 to the winner.
2470910	2471811	Necromashina.
2471951	2473352	That's not really that much money.
2473532	2474572	Yeah, Necromashina.
2474952	2475833	You should check that out.
2475973	2476853	That game looks awesome.
2477213	2478134	It's on PlayStation Network.
2478354	2479595	Are you playing Mario Crossover?
2482858	2487751	It's so good, it's got Ryu in it now I set mine up to work with my gamepad It's rad to the max
2490566	2492207	So I've been playing Mario Crossover this week.
2492407	2493568	And I've still been playing Mario Bros.
2493788	2495309	X. There's my week in gaming.
2495650	2497831	And I finished Red Dead Redemption and it was sad at the end.
2498572	2498852	Really?
2499032	2499152	Yes.
2499252	2500533	Jimmy wants this game too.
2500673	2500973	Alright.
2501534	2502414	Jimmy wants everything.
2502694	2502995	Alright.
2504055	2504916	I got no money.
2505256	2505857	Dan, good luck to you.
2505877	2506637	Unless you send me some.
2506677	2508238	Send me money so I can buy my wife games.
2508378	2509859	Good luck to you in the job search.
2509879	2511981	Dude, is this done by the same guy that did Strider?
2512001	2512621	You're a hard worker.
2512962	2513582	Everyone loves it.
2513622	2518686	You know, we have people that listen to this show that knew you from your store.
2519446	2522368	that was like, oh my god, Jamie's married to the guy at that store.
2522748	2525950	Jamie's married to that big jerk who works at Funkoland.
2527051	2528072	That poor woman.
2529292	2530773	You guys don't know what it's like here.
2531614	2532434	She's insane.
2533335	2533675	Alright.
2534636	2535336	Let's move on.
2535356	2536677	We gotta get into gaming news.
2536717	2537178	Thank you, Dan.
2537578	2537838	Alright.
2539419	2541380	Housekeeping and things that are coming up.
2542881	2543922	No show next week.
2543962	2544902	We already talked about that.
2545063	2546664	Oh, I want to mention this real quick.
2547708	2552875	IOS 4 is out, which is the iPhone thing, iPad software.
2553276	2557381	One of the things that's new in the IOS 4, and I'm not just talking about the iPhone 4.
2557421	2563890	I mean, yes, that's out too, but we realize a lot of people listen to this show on their iPhones, their iPods, their iTouches.
2564250	2566012	There's other devices too, we are aware.
2566112	2568113	Some people just listen straight up on their PC and that's cool.
2568494	2576120	But one of the new things in iOS 4 is that the show descriptions are actually now displayed on the screen while you listen to the podcast.
2576500	2581664	So we're going to try in a couple weeks something new with the notes for the show and we think you'll really like it.
2582565	2585968	But they're going to be kind of expanded and time stamped.
2586348	2587609	So we're going to try something new.
2588650	2613731	and we're hoping you guys will like it but that'll be in two weeks on the podcast or really the next podcast that'll hit the feed after this one so we hope you guys like it it's gonna take more work that goes into it though so all right appreciate it yeah I think people will like it it's kind of been a requested feature for a while so we'll see what happens all right anyhow we're only 45 minutes into the show and I barely touched gaming news how about some video game news we'll start off tonight with the one and only Loki
2614747	2619909	Yes, so it's been confirmed that the 3DS is coming out in 2011.
2621130	2630474	Now, of course, before Reggie actually appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show, yes, apparently Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is now a news source.
2632455	2636456	It was announced that the 3DS would be out in fiscal 2010.
2637077	2637737	I believe that's fiscal 2010.
2640758	2660232	Which would be between now and March 31st, 2011 But now it's been confirmed that it's actually going to launch in 2011 So, do the math, it's going to be the first three months of the year And, yeah, that's neat, I guess
2661690	2670532	hmm kind of disappointing I guess if you're looking forward to it for Christmas but hey there's enough crap coming out during Christmas one less thing I can deal with that
2672322	2677544	I totally agree that it's very strange that Jimmy Fallon has now become this kind of launching point for games.
2677564	2680185	Because I guess it was actually part of like a week of games or something.
2680245	2682525	He does games a lot on his show.
2682545	2685806	I don't know if you watched the clip, but Reggie kind of takes a jab.
2685867	2690248	I believe it's Sony because he says something about... And it's not like the guys that were here last night.
2690288	2692169	You don't need glasses to see this 3D.
2692509	2693689	He said something like that in the clip.
2694229	2697050	So it was just Reggie being Reggie, you know.
2698311	2698431	And...
2699671	2707836	Yeah, I mean, kind of a bummer, though, that it's not coming out until 2011, but I totally won a bet with GamerEaty, and now I'm getting a lunch bot for me.
2707896	2710798	So, GamerEaty, if you're listening, I like steak.
2711038	2711498	Just saying.
2711599	2712239	No, I'm just kidding.
2712619	2713059	I'm just kidding.
2713720	2714841	Well, I'm actually not kidding.
2714861	2715441	I did win a bet.
2717762	2721625	Do you think it was intended, maybe, for Reggie to say this on the show?
2721645	2723446	Because this seems like an odd place.
2723942	2725643	to give details about the release date?
2725663	2726803	Or do you think it just kind of slipped?
2727803	2728504	I don't think it slipped.
2728544	2737127	I think it's just that people, when they announced fiscal 2010, and people were like, oh my god, by the end of 2010, woo!
2737287	2750092	And so instead of just everybody being disappointed by figuring out that, hey, it's not coming out at holiday, he just went ahead and announced it so that you don't have to assume anymore.
2752262	2753543	What do you think this leaves for?
2753563	2765736	Because a lot of people were speculating that 3DS and on our nightly shows from E3 too, I know Shane and I were having some discussions on this, that the 3DS really had to come out this year because what else does Nintendo have for Christmas?
2766116	2769880	So what do you think the holiday season is going to look like for Nintendo?
2769920	2771882	I think it's going to be all their games.
2772603	2797163	The Kirby and the Donkey Kong Not everything, I mean Donkey Kong I think and Kirby are going to be this year I think Kirby is going to be the one that's in November There's a lot of stuff I think for October There's also a lot of stuff that they haven't announced Or announced last year Stuff that was shown on E3 last year is coming out I know there's a game on the Wii I can't remember if it was the Wii or DS It was one of the ones I saw last year though
2798264	2800548	Um, so there's still stuff to come out.
2801609	2804934	Never lied to me, I can't remember the timeline for, uh, was it Metroid Other M?
2804954	2806537	It's August 31st.
2806978	2810803	It was supposed to be out a couple days ago, because I remember it was my birthday weekend.
2810843	2811304	Actually, today.
2811324	2813487	I think it was supposed to be out today, but it got pushed back.
2814110	2816131	Well, that'll be a Christmas gift idea.
2816932	2817492	Yes, that's right.
2817512	2818333	That came out instead.
2818993	2819774	Have you checked that out?
2820354	2820614	Nope.
2820874	2821995	I have not played it yet.
2822095	2823636	Yeah, I didn't really play the first one, to be honest.
2824036	2825277	My Wii is still not hooked up.
2825877	2829399	I will probably not be hooking it up until Metroid Other M comes out, because I've got to play that.
2829439	2833662	I've got to play Metroid Other M. It does look cool.
2834403	2839806	But, yeah, I haven't played the Wii console since...
2843536	2845078	November, I think?
2845418	2848041	Some comments in our chatroom about Pokemon Black White.
2848362	2852246	Spyro in our chat is asking, is Pokemon Black and White cancelled?
2852947	2856370	No, I believe they even announced a release date.
2856511	2858032	October 19th in Japan.
2858373	2859414	Wasn't it even sooner than that?
2859434	2861676	Like the 18th of September, I thought I read?
2861716	2863098	No, it was October, I think.
2863178	2864880	Regardless, it's fall in Japan.
2865440	2879175	Fall of Japan So it won't have 3DS support I bet you anything it'll be out April in the US because that's usually when they've been releasing the Pokemon games around the April time frame
2880757	2882478	All right, well, we'll see if you're right or not.
2883038	2883619	I guess that's true.
2883679	2886700	This last little one with the Pokey Walker ball came out in April-ish.
2886840	2887561	That was March.
2887981	2888261	Was it?
2888581	2888901	Yeah.
2888921	2890462	I'm sorry, it was right before PAX East.
2890582	2892383	Everybody had one of those stupid things there.
2892523	2895725	Okay, Pokemon HeartGold, SoulSilver, that was March.
2896325	2897726	Pokemon Platinum was March.
2898226	2903249	Pokemon Explorers of the Sky and Explorers of Time, that was April.
2906070	2907331	Diamond Pearl was April.
2909545	2911487	So yeah, it's usually March or April.
2925844	2927044	The 3DS cards are a little bigger.
2927185	2927725	Maybe it won't matter.
2927745	2928285	I don't know.
2928866	2931187	Could be like the advanced dungeons in Zelda.
2931207	2932028	That's what I think of.
2932288	2934249	I don't think that they're... They might.
2934449	2938032	I mean, there's... I would say, if anything, it's going to have DSi support.
2938412	2939793	Probably not 3DS.
2939933	2946017	It might have some really silly stuff, like the whole game won't be in 3D, but maybe like the evolution scenes or something silly.
2946097	2948098	Just like little one-off things will be in 3D.
2948179	2948779	Little, little things.
2949239	2949559	We'll see.
2949960	2950640	I don't think so.
2950700	2956344	And the reason why is because they're going to be in the old carts and it's going to be too hard to hold that extra data on there.
2956745	2960187	But DSI support's been something that they've been doing a lot with different games.
2960387	2966572	Not necessarily, you know, you don't have to play it on the DSI, but if you do, you can, you know, do different things.
2967770	2968952	Also some other comments in chat.
2969272	2973378	Ranma is a big fan of the 3DS, saying, I will get a 3DS and I will shank someone if I have to.
2973418	2974761	I think a lot of people feel that way, actually.
2975201	2978687	Frisbee is trying to top us all, saying, I haven't played my Wii since 2008.
2980836	2984198	I'm curious, though, if Frisbee's going to break it out for anything that Nintendo announced this year.
2984958	2994664	I did play Wii Sports Golf on Friday because they were setting up something for some company that we had coming into our work.
2994724	2996465	They were having a Wii Sports Golf tournament.
2996485	2998706	I don't think day job stuff should count, though, to be honest.
2999166	3001448	Well, in that case, then I don't play Grand Theft Auto ever.
3002388	3005530	Well, okay, you do that on your break, though, but I get what you're saying.
3006190	3009072	Well, technically it wasn't working if I'm playing Wii Sports Golf.
3011024	3011965	WeSportsResortGolf
3034818	3049395	Microsoft representative confirmed to them that a $199 version of their new Xbox 360, which they're now calling the short Xbox 360, or they put that in quotes, they're not calling it the Slim now, which is good, because we talked about this last week.
3049516	3051558	It is not the Xbox 360 Slim, right?
3051918	3052860	It has another name.
3053420	3057541	Alright, so anyway, it is going to be coming out for $199.
3057821	3064503	There is also a new setup that's going to have the Xbox 6 system and Kinect together, which I think a lot of people knew.
3066624	3070605	So there you go, $199 Xbox 360 system coming out soon.
3071145	3075806	No date, no idea, but probably what, fall-ish, I think you were predicting, Loki?
3076086	3077186	Before the holidays for sure.
3077686	3078787	For the new system?
3079227	3079307	Um...
3080903	3086949	The new SKUs with the Kinect isn't coming out until when the Kinect does, so that'll be November 4th.
3087890	3096879	I bet you the $1.99 system, probably as early as September, just to cash in on Halo Reach.
3098300	3099842	That's also when they've done price drops.
3100102	3103166	If you were thinking about getting an Xbox right now, wait.
3104047	3109173	Well, wait and see anyways because you know how they're saying that there's going to be a new $199 SKU?
3109313	3111275	What if they're just dropping the price of the system to $199?
3113803	3141045	you never know I would think though if anything they do a lot of their price drops and big pushes towards the holiday and especially when they want to capitalize on a game like Halo Reach just wait for some better deals to be coming out and besides even if you wait longer what they've been doing in the past is bundling in some games with your Xbox 360 system for free so if you do wait you still might get some free stuff
3141625	3145847	Alpha Catanagram in our chat room at chat.org.com is asking, Wait, how much is this bundle?
3145887	3146467	Did they say?
3146807	3148108	I must know for Child of Eden.
3148568	3149708	Everyone's speculating, what, $300?
3149948	3150669	I think $300.
3150869	3151649	Yeah.
3151729	3154870	Well, $299 is what the system is right now.
3155651	3155971	It might be $399.
3158052	3158292	Hmm.
3159332	3161473	I wonder if there'll be a basic version with Kinect, though.
3161493	3162013	I bet there is.
3163054	3163474	We'll see.
3163494	3164054	It's hard to say.
3164294	3165195	If they're going to do...
3167386	3170388	I don't know, they could do a smaller hard drive because the hard drive is removable.
3170868	3171148	It is.
3171648	3172669	Just like the PS3.
3174109	3175130	I know, isn't that awesome?
3176010	3176571	It is awesome.
3177211	3178832	Alright, Loki, how big is the hard drive?
3178852	3180313	Are you going to try to put a terabyte drive in there?
3181073	3181853	I'm not getting a new system.
3181893	3182794	Oh yeah, you don't need one.
3182814	3184315	You have like five Xbox 360s.
3184895	3187016	I wish I had five Xbox 360s.
3187917	3190498	I don't know how many Xbox 360s I have anymore.
3190518	3191098	That's crazy.
3191238	3191839	That's awesome though.
3193460	3202747	Speaking about the Xbox 360, it doesn't look like they're going to be getting Final Fantasy XIV because their system is so different.
3203387	3211393	They were wanting to play like a normal internet environment and wanted for the consoles to mirror how it works on the PC.
3212654	3217498	Microsoft has a closed environment so they still can't work up an agreement.
3218171	3219912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3246434	3265180	but Final Fantasy XI I don't think it did that well on the 360 and I really don't have anything to base it off of but I'm just spec you know just kind of knowing who played it what systems they were playing on I don't think it did well on the 360 because most people who wanted to play it already had it on PS2 and PC you know what I mean
3265760	3271003	I don't know if that set a bad precedent for MMOs in general, but if that was the case, that seems kind of crappy to me.
3271503	3275645	But there's one other MMO on Xbox 360 right now, and that's Phantasy Star Universe.
3275945	3277786	Again, I don't think that did very well either.
3281307	3283168	They also were trying to get Champions Online.
3283889	3286010	They said that the game ran just fine.
3286050	3288831	It was the business end of getting everything in line.
3291176	3307496	it seems strange to me that Microsoft is kind of shooting themselves in the foot with these MMOs especially with Final Fantasy XIV and DC Universe both slated for the PS3 this fall I mean this could be where the PS3 has their own agency we know is coming out too what MMOs are on their way for 360?
3308037	3309318	are there any at this point that we know of?
3310280	3310400	no
3310916	3315382	If any, they need a recent MMO like Final Fantasy XIV.
3315942	3321209	I mean, if trends are to be believed, they got MMOs that were sort of past their prime.
3321509	3321770	Or their...
3326463	3353944	or they're turning their nose up at MMOs which you know they could get away with doing possibly MMOs have always you know Sony somewhat is I don't know if they're necessarily taking a risk but the developers are taking a risk putting the games out on PS3 but I don't know like again I really enjoy DC Universe on the PS3 that I played at E3 and I could see myself paying money for that on the PlayStation 3 if they succeed then Microsoft's gonna have to catch up
3356141	3356401	I don't know.
3356421	3362029	It just seems very strange to me that they would not be trying to bend over backwards to get Final Fantasy XIV on their system.
3362049	3363311	But maybe they're thinking, you know what?
3363612	3366095	XI didn't do that great, so XIV's not going to either.
3367697	3368338	I have no idea.
3369360	3370722	I think Microsoft has their own agenda.
3371951	3377133	Comment from SalaciousPop in chat, and this is something he was telling me about earlier today, and I want to share this with you guys too.
3377534	3380835	Champions Online was developed for a 360 release.
3381275	3386177	Even playing the PC version, you can see the 360 integration screaming at you from the UI.
3386598	3393921	Champions Online was a huge flop, and it probably has to do with the fact that at least 50% of its platform audience never actually got the game.
3396342	3396882	So there you go.
3398075	3406437	Champions Online maybe was unfortunately did in by this whole fact that the 360 was not going to be having its MMO or made it too difficult.
3407258	3407778	Unfortunate.
3409978	3412739	Bochikawa says PS3 is a free online service.
3412779	3413559	Same on PC.
3413619	3415880	I think Microsoft lost majorly because of that.
3416160	3422242	Well, keep in mind, I can't remember for PSU, but I know for Final Fantasy XI, it would work with a silver account.
3422782	3423583	PlayOnline was never cool
3443477	3445698	I thought it was cool when it first came out, but that was it.
3445978	3450860	But anyhow, the interesting thing, and PlayOnline is on the 360 version, but here's the crazy thing about PlayOnline.
3451400	3456602	It's a joint venture between Square Enix and Sony.
3457902	3461144	PlayOnline is a Sony code, and it was on the 360.
3464400	3467683	Final Fantasy XI was a really not typical game on the 360.
3468824	3470305	It broke all the rules.
3471025	3473307	But they were excited to have a Final Fantasy game on their console.
3473427	3475389	They let it break the rules.
3475529	3479372	Just like they let Castlevania break the rules and it ended up setting a precedent.
3479752	3482674	With the whole Symphony of the Night coming out on the arcade.
3483075	3488319	Keep in mind, in Japan, Symphony of the Night did come out on the Saturn.
3490114	3491635	What's that have to do with the 360 one, though?
3492036	3499782	Because, I mean, even back in the day, Sony didn't have the whole exclusive... I see.
3500162	3505746	It was supposed to have been exclusive, and then the Saturn version came out, which apparently had all the stuff that the programmers never got to put in.
3505946	3506227	I see.
3506387	3506707	I getcha.
3509489	3509729	I don't know.
3509749	3512512	It'd be interesting to see what kind of comes of that.
3512532	3513633	And the Saturn version was better.
3514033	3519839	I think, honestly, if you haven't heard of it by this point, Final Fantasy XIV will not be on the 360 release date anyway.
3520259	3522882	Can they add it the next year if the game becomes popular?
3523322	3523702	Maybe.
3524183	3524683	But I don't know.
3524703	3524723	I...
3526678	3527399	I don't know, guys.
3527959	3529080	I really don't.
3529140	3532943	I'll try Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm just kind of like, there's just something about it.
3533003	3536165	I have a really bad feeling it's going to flop.
3536345	3537546	I don't know what it is.
3538807	3547714	I think just because XI was so received mixed, and I don't think the PS3 is as adopted as the PS2 was, and the 360, I don't know.
3547974	3549135	Call me crazy.
3549255	3553258	What's funny is there's still a Final Fantasy XIV skew on Xbox 360.
3553539	3556501	It still exists, whether it's actually going to come out or not.
3557133	3558453	Well, I think it's a placeholder.
3559013	3559654	You know what, though?
3560054	3562995	There might be a lot that they're developing that they don't plan on releasing.
3563035	3566635	I mean, maybe a 360 version is further along than any of us are giving credit for.
3567136	3573497	Because one other thing, I don't know if we talked about when we did the E3 report, but Final Fantasy XIV also supports 3D right now.
3574017	3577038	You can put on 3D glasses if you have those Uber monitors for your PC.
3577078	3580199	You can play Final Fantasy XIV in 3D.
3580339	3583560	But they took great caution to tell us
3584520	3612681	we're messing with this right now we don't know if it's going to be in the full release this is a concept thing that you're seeing so who knows there Bochikawa in our chatroom says 14 will suck yes but it will still sell we'll see we'll see I again I hate to base my opinion off an early build of the game I do believe though I I think if 14 gets delayed to next year it's not bad news but that's just me anyhow Loki what do you got for us
3613441	3626239	Apparently there's a rumor coming from Bloomberg saying that Sony may close a deal securing the rights to bring Hulu to the PlayStation Network.
3626359	3629423	It says the partnership could be announced as soon as next week.
3630304	3646971	and that's kind of interesting since you know apparently there's also a similar report saying that it might be coming to Xbox 360 and the iPad as well and would offer a premium Hulu service where you could possibly pay for maybe streaming of old
3648131	3674760	Archive stuff kind of interesting actually that they're thinking about bringing it to that platform I don't know I think it'll eventually probably make its way to each console platform except for the Wii maybe but why not you can kind of do it right now with well you could have done it before with the web browser you can do it with third party software like Diversity and stuff like that but I could definitely see this happening
3678726	3682268	It's interesting that Hulu keeps coming up time and time again.
3682388	3684209	It's just like, happen already, darn it.
3685790	3686030	Yeah.
3688191	3690352	It's just a matter of time.
3691893	3693374	We're just waiting to see what happens.
3694915	3701119	Alright, well, something I really don't think you need to wait much longer to see if it happens or not has to do with the price of Kinect.
3701980	3710746	You know what we've been saying, you know, as have most of the gaming press, that Kinect is going to cost you $150, but Microsoft, for whatever reason, just won't confirm it.
3710806	3712667	Like, they will not tell you the price of Kinect.
3712987	3713768	But then this week...
3714608	3716369	on the official Microsoft store.
3716569	3717529	That's right, online.
3717549	3720650	You know, Microsoft has a store online just like Apple does and a lot of different companies do.
3721370	3724131	They now are selling the Kinect sensor for the Xbox 360 for $149.99.
3724191	3728693	So there you go.
3729093	3730894	That's like, what do we cost?
3731554	3733254	Yeah, interesting, huh?
3733615	3738676	I really hope this comes with a bundle in-game because just $150 for the device itself.
3739417	3741357	It better come with a bundle of several games.
3741877	3743438	Ow, I shot myself in the foot.
3743658	3748379	Well, the rumor is it is coming bundled with a game.
3748779	3749839	Oh, really, Loki?
3749879	3750499	What have you heard?
3751179	3752980	I heard that there's going to be a pack-in game.
3753380	3754320	Not sure what it is.
3754340	3755040	Do you know which one?
3755720	3757481	I don't think it's anything that's probably been announced yet.
3757501	3758721	It's probably just tech demos.
3758741	3762361	Well, not tech demos, but remember how Wii Sports was?
3763102	3764342	That was all their tech demos.
3765242	3766122	That would be my guess.
3767722	3770543	It could be very well one of Kinect Sports or something like that.
3770583	3771003	You never know.
3771323	3780493	Well, one other quick thing on Kinect I want to get out there is that if you were unable to go to E3 and you happen to live near a Microsoft store, there's not a lot of these.
3780513	3781173	There's like four.
3781233	3785037	I think there's like two in Southern California, one in Arizona, I want to say.
3785057	3785818	There's not a lot of these.
3786118	3787980	There's like four Microsoft stores.
3788080	3792004	They're kind of like Apple stores, but instead of Apple, it's Microsoft.
3792925	3807863	you can play the Kinect in the stores they actually have the demos right now Kinectimals according to the official Twitter for the stores which is at Microsoft Store on Twitter is the game that's being shown off right now so it sounds like they're going to rotate in different Kinect games
3808483	3812125	You know what I noticed when they have a new piece of interface technology?
3812145	3818348	Remember when the DS was just released and they just had games that amounted to just tech demos?
3818408	3820649	I mean like Yoshi Touch and Go.
3821709	3827152	And then for the first part of the lifespan of the Wii, they just had games that were mostly just tech demos.
3827992	3834356	I would hope since motion sensor technology is matured by now that Microsoft would have more than glorified tech demos.
3834396	3857832	Well, the technology is matured but unfortunately people and developers have not matured and I understand that developers can do way better than what's out there right now but people like what's out there right now and so that's why they're emulating the same stuff you see on other systems like a Wii Sports type game, a Wii Sports Resort type game, a party game, that kind of stuff.
3858652	3863114	Since you brought up the DS launch titles though, I have to say this, because this always cracks me up.
3863554	3867516	You know what DS game, I don't know if it was a launch title, but it came out in the first three months.
3867556	3869617	Rob, I owned Ping Pals.
3869677	3870878	Oh, it was so terrible.
3870938	3872418	Ping Pals was so terrible.
3872438	3873619	I bought two copies.
3873719	3875620	I was coerced into buying two copies.
3875660	3877841	It was so terrible, but here's why.
3878061	3878401	Here's why.
3878861	3880622	It was this awesome DS game.
3880962	3882723	I say awesome very sarcastically, by the way.
3883104	3889747	Where you could chat with other people on their nearby DSs by drawing.
3890228	3892769	And you could do these draw chats back and forth.
3892829	3894470	And that's what Pink Pals was all about.
3895171	3897152	It was PictoChat with avatars.
3897372	3899773	Boy, Nintendo fucked them over, didn't they?
3899873	3900754	And it was $30 times two.
3907027	3911133	It's like, yeah, you can pay for this, or you can play it for free now.
3911914	3913656	Yeah, Pink Pals wasn't even online.
3914217	3916019	It had these avatars.
3916059	3917481	I guess there was some type of game.
3917521	3922848	You may remember, Rob, that when the DS came out, they didn't have online.
3923749	3947605	that's right but it was like it was like that hidden thing it was that secret thing that Nintendo always puts that magical thing in their new system that they'll they'll tell you later gotcha it was in there the whole time there's always something like that seriously with the DS it was the internet like oh secretly it was there the whole time the Wii's kind of had I don't know it has some slumbering stuff like that too the channels that they come out with and stuff you know just interesting
3947873	3955778	So since the buying public is used to it, Microsoft's gonna pick up a shovel and Sony's gonna pick up a shovel and just start shoveling games our way.
3958099	3959440	Well, here's what I'm saying.
3959460	3966024	I understand that the Wii has the advantage of the price point because it's $150 now.
3966964	3975349	And they do have the disadvantage that you have to buy the extra sensor if you want to play those games.
3975829	3975929	Um...
3977230	3979912	But I mean, once again, it's all about perception.
3979952	3991342	Because yeah, Wii costs $150, but let's say if you're setting it up for a family of four, it's going to cost a lot more to do that with a Wii than it would be on an Xbox 360.
3991922	3999649	I mean, even though it may seem that the Wii is a better choice, with all the extra added crap to it, it's going to add up.
3999849	3999929	And...
4001170	4002391	With Sony, it's the same thing.
4002411	4004312	You're going to have to buy all these different accessories.
4004592	4007954	Now, I know you don't have to buy all these accessories if you want to play by yourself.
4008294	4008934	That's fine.
4008974	4013416	Or if you want to play with just one other person, then you can save yourself a little bit of money.
4013496	4017898	But at least with the Kinect, it'll support up to as many players as the game will support.
4019019	4025304	Alright, before we get to Jamie's next story and then the release dates here, I've got to read this real quick because this was linked to us in chat by Robocoon.
4025724	4030007	Linked us to the official Ping Pals Wikipedia article and I've got to read this excerpt because it's gold.
4030147	4030368	Ready?
4031068	4032209	Keep in mind this is Wikipedia.
4032950	4034711	Ping Pals was released on December 8th, 2004.
4066834	4069884	The reviewer gave a one-word written summary reading, pointless.
4071914	4072274	Let's see.
4072754	4080537	Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game an average of .5 out of 10 with the game receiving two zeros and one 1.5.
4080797	4083297	But it was really shiny, girl-friendly air.
4083337	4083978	That's my favorite.
4084278	4085258	Girl-friendly.
4087399	4089539	Yeah, that's why I had to buy two copies.
4089899	4093340	Maybe being a brain-dead vegetable hooked up to life support girl-friendly.
4093440	4095821	The GMR magazine gave it a 0 out of 10.
4097161	4098322	It's below their normal scale.
4099022	4099242	Nice.
4100109	4101530	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4101550	4102950	Do you have a girl-friendly story for us?
4103250	4104431	I have something that makes me happy.
4104731	4105031	Okay.
4105251	4106752	Facebook games are going poop.
4108693	4110714	And keep in mind, the only thing that I play is Hotel City.
4111154	4113175	Good, I'm a fan of not playing Farmville.
4113815	4114836	Yeah, I hate Farmville.
4114896	4118437	Farmville is like the poop that dung beetles poop.
4120118	4121899	Farmville's free on the iPhone right now, you know?
4122139	4122579	Yeah.
4123340	4124080	They'd have to pay me.
4124160	4124660	At any rate.
4124700	4126321	My friends are now playing Frontierville.
4127481	4144953	Gamasutra keeps up with the who's playing what on Facebook games and basically the big Zynga games have gone down Farmville went from 66.6 million to 63.9 million Treasure Isle dropped 2.5 million and Cafe World lost 1.5 million
4150617	4158099	The only thing there that's really keeping it steady that's attracting new players is Texas Hold'em Poker.
4158899	4160780	We've got 28.6 million players.
4161340	4163261	You've got to wonder how many of those are actual people.
4165301	4168082	I hate the stupid games.
4168122	4171363	I think people are finally starting to go, I'm wasting my time.
4172483	4173483	I could do something.
4173724	4175224	Have you ever heard the music in Farmville?
4175244	4175284	No.
4177503	4178605	Oh, they made new ones.
4178806	4179046	What?
4179647	4179928	Oh, God.
4179948	4181250	When I played Farm... Never mind.
4181691	4184576	When I used to play Farmville, the theme song was so horrible.
4184716	4188202	It was this one thing that would loop over and over and over again.
4188242	4189705	I guess now... I tried it once.
4192156	4194578	And then I was like, why?
4195619	4198221	And like, it's not even why as a question, it's why as a statement.
4199902	4204385	Like, if I was typing it, it would be, it would have no capitalization and have a period at the end.
4204966	4205786	It would just be why.
4207228	4207928	Or what.
4208468	4208689	What.
4210376	4211637	Yeah, it would be a statement.
4212017	4214158	It wouldn't even require grammar.
4214419	4215399	But see, here's the thing.
4216760	4219622	I'm actually really looking forward to the Civilization Facebook game.
4220262	4223104	Like, there's some really cool sounding stuff around the corner.
4223304	4224365	You're a Civ nerd.
4224665	4225385	I really am.
4226446	4227106	Go buy Civ.
4227627	4228667	Like 7-Elevenville?
4230889	4232230	I don't think I'll play 7-Elevenville.
4232990	4234952	That's not a joke, is it?
4235473	4239818	Zynga, Zynga, Zynga, Zynga, whatever has really taken over 7-Eleven.
4239858	4240659	It's kind of disgusting.
4242221	4243802	What kind of Slurpees do they have?
4244743	4245464	I didn't even look.
4245865	4247627	They still have the whole Iron Man stuff.
4248683	4249444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4274044	4277167	Hey, that's going to be a reality in California after November.
4277187	4281470	I don't know if you heard, but it's qualifying for the ballot.
4281750	4283111	Do you want to smoke weed?
4283171	4283831	Yes or no?
4283851	4285192	In a nutshell.
4285392	4288154	Oh God, what is my anti-nausea?
4288314	4288915	It'll pass.
4289955	4291456	Well, not even a question.
4291476	4292157	It's going to pass.
4292217	4294959	I'm glad you asked because it's coming in November.
4296147	4296627	Outro Music
4319621	4322824	No, we're gonna be Amsterdam the sequel.
4322964	4323444	Oh my god.
4323645	4324946	It's a good time to stay indoors.
4324966	4326267	Just need the hookers now.
4326547	4326988	Here's the thing.
4328677	4329598	for like 60 days.
4329698	4330898	They had to go to Reno for that.
4331478	4332338	It's too far away.
4332379	4333059	For 60 days.
4333079	4334319	They'll never be able to make it on the pot.
4334359	4337560	It's going to be the most lulzy thing you could ever imagine.
4338241	4340801	Everybody will be high for like 60 days.
4340821	4341302	Not everybody.
4341382	4342022	I don't smoke pot.
4342342	4344563	The day California stood still.
4344983	4349485	There's going to be so many people just like it's 420 every day.
4349605	4350545	And then you know what?
4352726	4355186	It's like when Prohibition was eliminated.
4355206	4357447	Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, pass out, wake up.
4357527	4358267	Okay, we're over it.
4358607	4360448	I'm going to get political for a second, Rob.
4360468	4360688	May I?
4361828	4362528	Oh, hell, why not?
4362968	4363488	Disclaimer.
4363849	4365929	Okay, let's go ahead and look back at history.
4366049	4369950	And this is why this whole stupid war on drugs thing is pretty much bullshit.
4371411	4374371	When they made booze illegal, what happened?
4374892	4375432	Black market.
4375852	4376832	An increase in crime.
4376892	4380093	We had the heyday of the old school gangster.
4382132	4383774	But Dick Tracy was here to make it all better.
4410014	4428964	and the moment it became illegal their prices shot up so they could charge more for it and then they were having people run guns and everything and another one actually in the same comic is when Opus and Bill were running for president and the drug traffickers came up and said we hope you'll have tough gun laws that makes more profit for us
4431346	4440954	I know that that's a parody, just a little political commentary on it, but the numbers are there.
4442355	4451683	Gun-free zones have a higher rate of gun-related deaths than places where it's legal to carry a firearm.
4453564	4455226	Criminals don't really care if it's legal or not.
4455951	4458733	No, but they're less likely to use it when the other person might be armed too.
4458953	4462355	I feel like Jamie should have a theme song when she's giving history lessons here on the show.
4463175	4465557	So do you want to continue with your history lesson here?
4465597	4465917	Yes, I do.
4466057	4466797	I'll play a little bit of...
4469404	4470324	God Save the Queen here.
4470625	4471125	Oh, Lord.
4472605	4473006	Anyway.
4477107	4493014	But I'm saying, and I'm going to completely second what you said, Rob, the moment that the potloss pass, you're going to have a month where people are going to go, and all of the right-wing nutjobs are going to go, ah, see, we told you.
4494015	4497837	And then a month later, two months later, it'll be nothing.
4498017	4498777	No one will care about it.
4499437	4500900	You mean I can go outside?
4500920	4502784	Yes, it's safe.
4502804	4504267	You mean I actually do go outside?
4505490	4506572	Is it safe?
4507574	4508596	But you know what this means?
4509097	4509939	There will come a day...
4510902	4514044	The Orange Lounge Radio episode where we're all high as fuck.
4515384	4518106	And that will be just another episode where I'm in the chat room.
4518126	4519326	I'm actually allergic to pot, by the way.
4519346	4519887	Yeah, me too.
4519927	4521207	It'll sound like every other episode.
4521348	4525370	Yeah, I'm allergic to pot, too.
4525410	4533554	But my whole point, and this is the biggest thing with... In fact, I've been listening to a lot of history podcasts, and maybe I'll plug them later.
4534194	4534414	But...
4535615	4550919	The biggest thing for anyone, if you want to look at what's going on in business right now, if you want to look at what's going on in politics right now, if you want to see, is A or B going to work, look to about 100 to 80 years ago.
4552819	4554840	And then tell me, will it work?
4557060	4558861	Oh, it's the same idea, it's the same idea.
4558881	4558961	Yeah.
4559594	4564236	I think in this year, 2010, the question is not will it work, but will it blend?
4566537	4566817	Alright.
4568258	4569279	Thank you for letting me rant.
4569619	4569999	You're welcome.
4570219	4575902	Just the biggest thing is that if you want to see if something's going to work now, look to the past.
4576722	4579984	Frisbee in our chatroom says, OLR with weed is Orange Lawn's foodio.
4580104	4582425	Like I said, just like every other week.
4583737	4586838	Have you ever done OLR on weed?
4586858	4590019	You boys like Mexico?
4590759	4593420	And by the way, one last little political snipe.
4593800	4594021	Yes?
4595281	4609866	If you want to see what, you know, for all the advocates that were voting for unregulated business, look back to Carnegie and to Rockefeller and see how well people fared when they were in control of unregulated business.
4610426	4611388	Everything in moderation.
4611948	4613690	Exactly.
4613770	4614711	Moderate, moderation.
4616033	4616994	That's redundant.
4617374	4619857	I know.
4620157	4622040	Your redundancy is repetitive.
4623561	4624382	Let's move on.
4624783	4625644	Release dates.
4627325	4628967	Lead is coming out November 4th.
4630148	4630569	Just kidding.
4630909	4631189	All right.
4631990	4633051	What's coming out in the U.S.?
4633151	4637456	You know, that's kind of odd that it's timed right with the Kinect.
4639178	4640139	It works off weed.
4640539	4641560	Now, anyways.
4642557	4644558	There's lots of stuff actually coming out this week.
4644578	4648919	It's a pretty decent release week, which is good because next week, there's not a whole lot.
4649180	4652421	So this week, we've got Sin and Punishment Star Successor.
4652461	4653261	Actually, it's not this week.
4653481	4654322	That's today!
4654862	4657503	So you've missed out on it already, possibly.
4658543	4663268	and you wasted your whole day watching the Mario Marathon and you could have been playing Sin and Punishment.
4663328	4664209	At least it's a good cause.
4664649	4665530	Yes.
4666191	4670114	Death Smiles Limited Edition making its way out to the Xbox 360 this week.
4670474	4672056	A pretty awesome shmup game.
4672096	4674058	Definitely worth picking up and plus you get a
4674338	4675639	99 Nights 2, Now With More Nights
4706153	4707536	Coming to Xbox 360 99 Nights 2 Night Harder
4712218	4721041	99 Nights 2, Electric Boogaloo Singularity on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4721561	4722681	Might call that Time Shift 2.
4724842	4731444	The Last Airbender, the game based off the movie, based off the anime, based off another game.
4733365	4734425	That's on DS and Wii.
4734805	4740207	I'm sure it's going to be so much better than the ones based off the animated series.
4743940	4748887	Sniper Ghost Warrior on PC and Xbox 360 Sniper Ghost Warrior?
4749608	4749868	Yes.
4751129	4752309	They're reaching for titles.
4752429	4758471	It sounds like a sci-fi movie starring Deborah Gibson and Tiffany.
4758972	4762993	They're like ghosts because they hide in the shadows and snipe you in the head.
4763653	4767235	I gotta start that tangent again about why they need to make games out of sci-fi movies.
4767695	4772437	Did you hear the one this week about Debbie Gibson and Tiffany being in a movie together?
4772937	4775758	I saw that article and I was just like, I don't care.
4777455	4778216	You know what though?
4778516	4783741	I do agree with you because cheesy games do end up being pretty cool.
4784361	4791788	Which is why, once again, I must urge you, D3 Publishing, bring over the simple series.
4792088	4794050	Come on, you know you wanna.
4794330	4796832	And I know Oni Chambara didn't really do that well.
4796852	4800054	All you need to do is put more levels and they only have to be that different.
4800414	4803596	Just more levels, completely forget the last games existed, add a few different enemy types.
4803616	4806417	I think you should make a level editor in there and four player co-op.
4823832	4826755	and 4Player System Link or 4Player Over Live.
4828416	4828736	Gold!
4828916	4830678	Speaking of ludicrous, you might like this, Loki.
4831118	4835382	I was listening to Bobby's show on the way over here in the car on the handy-dandy All Games iPhone app.
4835962	4838164	And he was talking about risk factions.
4838284	4841327	And I'm kind of paraphrasing here because I haven't played the game myself, but he did.
4841687	4847052	But he was talking about how, you know, there's classic risk in there where you can play as all the different countries and da-da-da-da-da.
4847452	4848113	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4859798	4863940	So you can lead an army of cats against an army of zombies.
4864801	4865541	Amazing.
4866222	4869744	So we need more cheesy games like Tachyon starring Bruce Campbell.
4869764	4871905	President Cat, hello, whatever happened with that?
4871945	4872846	Don't think I ever forgot.
4873066	4875247	I mean, look at the symbol series over in Japan.
4875367	4879930	On the PlayStation 2, they've released like a good 50 games at least.
4880550	4886655	In that series, for like 20 bucks, they just take these really weird independent games, I guess, and then throw them out there.
4886675	4887316	I mean, they have what?
4887716	4892200	They have one with nurses with miniguns mowing down zombies.
4892260	4894922	They have zombies versus ambulance!
4895182	4897584	You drive an ambulance and you run over zombies!
4897944	4898825	It's awesome!
4899045	4909314	And then, you know, there's actually a lot of games with zombies now that I think of it for the simple series, because there's only Chambara, which is basically you fighting zombies with a samurai sword and a chick wearing a bikini and a cowboy hat.
4910115	4912999	Um, but Earth Defense Force is so awesome, though.
4913539	4921871	It's an incredible game, and I really want to go back and play the PlayStation 2 version of Earth Defense Force 2 because they have, like, a chick with a jetpack you can fly around as.
4922672	4924995	Um, they have these different, um...
4926056	4953907	different looking characters I mean they're the same like they have the robot types and the UFOs and stuff like that but the one robot type in there kind of looks like a tripod from War of the Worlds and that's really cool and it's just the whole point is cheesy stuff even like you know Zombies Ate My Neighbors a perfect example of how you can make a game that's cheesy that parodies a bunch of like you know old sci-fi horror movies I think it's a great idea but anyways we're getting on a tangent here so
4954987	4956329	OLR Tangents?
4956530	4957351	No, never.
4957671	4958913	More stuff coming out this week.
4958953	4961116	Fallen Earth Blood Sports on PC.
4961897	4965623	Kind of wonder what sports are they playing in Fallen Earth?
4966945	4967646	I don't know.
4968687	4969348	It doesn't say.
4969989	4971111	I think it's an expansion.
4972802	4973223	DarkSakura
4988663	4991366	Let's see, what other fun stuff do we have here?
4992287	4995370	Oh yeah, just sing with microphone for the DS.
4995531	4998274	So you can sing karaoke on your DS.
4998294	5000156	So just dance, but sing?
5000776	5001197	Not quite.
5002438	5003019	Different company.
5003980	5005261	I wonder if you can sing brew.
5007346	5009768	Naughty Bear on PlayStation 3.
5009888	5013370	There's a lot of those in San Francisco this weekend.
5013390	5015072	Did you see the trailer for that?
5015492	5016473	That looks like fun.
5016833	5018094	No, I haven't seen it.
5018954	5020295	I'll YouTube it right now.
5020555	5023017	It's like Hitman with teddy bears.
5023037	5029321	You're trying to get revenge on all the other little teddy bears in the village and the whole point is to be as evil as possible.
5029381	5031323	You have an evil meter, or naughty meter.
5032063	5037931	and, like, you can kill them, but you get more points for torturing them and being witnessed torturing them.
5038492	5039954	So it's Overlord with teddy bears.
5041516	5042277	It's beautiful.
5042437	5044299	It's horrible and beautiful at the same time.
5044359	5044820	I love it.
5045020	5046682	That looks like Crackdown 2.
5046883	5048725	Oh, wait, this is an ad.
5048805	5049506	Fucking YouTube.
5049546	5049826	Hold on.
5052527	5053768	Crackdown 2 is an excellent game.
5053788	5055230	That'll be coming out next week on the 6th.
5055290	5057012	Yeah, but that's not what I want to see the video for right now.
5057052	5058373	I want Naughty Bear.
5058393	5061196	But it's way better than Naughty Bear, sadly.
5061297	5063759	Naughty Bear, though, you can set traps for them and get their feet caught.
5063799	5066863	Do you know how much fucking traffic those Naughty Bears caused in San Francisco today?
5066903	5067784	I had to go around.
5068124	5068384	Okay.
5068825	5069686	Oh, here we go.
5070347	5070947	Naughty Bear.
5070967	5070947	360.
5071168	5071408	Shut up.
5081204	5092836	The game revolves around earning naughty points and a scoring system that is deep but easy to understand.
5093356	5096640	There are over 250 different ways of being naughty on the island.
5097160	5101885	Basically, you earn points for any naughty things you do and any naughtiness that the other bears witness.
5102125	5111534	Any actions, even basic ones like disabling a car or smashing a window, will start building your multiplier, and this will boost your points for as long as you keep your naughtiness going.
5111855	5118061	There are dozens of weapons to use, from pistols and machetes to more unusual weapons like umbrellas and frozen legs of lamb.
5118541	5126169	There are also mundane everyday objects like refrigerators, cars, and barbecue grills to experiment with, each one having its own hilarious finishing move.
5127682	5130029	You know who needs to narrate this game is Super Nanny.
5135745	5137607	You've been extremely naughty.
5137767	5139708	Go sit in the naughty corner.
5141549	5145072	...and they'll give you way more points as they witness all the chaos you're causing.
5145732	5151296	Part of the fun of the game is discovering all the different actions that you can do, each one viciously naughty in its own special way.
5151857	5157521	You can play the game any way you want to and do what you think is best for your current situation to get the most points out of it.
5158041	5164686	Keep in mind, though, that taking risks, being creative, and changing your tactics often will reward you with a lot more naughty points.
5165674	5165934	PS3 and Xbox 360
5195943	5199256	I gotta say, I might have been joking about this, but now it sounds kind of cool.
5199537	5201686	Thank you, Jamie and Matt for pointing this one out.
5202106	5209308	A couple expansions being released this week for Arma 2, Operation Arrowhead, and Combined Operations on the PC.
5210828	5213089	Junior Classics, Books and Fairy Tales.
5213389	5214089	That's crap.
5214869	5217770	Hot Shots Tennis coming out on PSP.
5218810	5230833	Trinity Universe, another kind of culmination of a bunch of different RPG franchises, including Nippon Ichi and... I want to say, like...
5231613	5242965	It's kind of the people behind the other crossover games like, not Namco X, Capcom, but Cross Universe, that kind of stuff.
5244066	5246709	But that is coming from Nippon Ichi, and it'll be fun.
5246949	5248230	Lots of Disgaea stuff in there.
5249431	5253736	TNA crossed the line on PSP and DS.
5256792	5262019	Vampire Legends The Power of Three It's an adventure game featuring vampires.
5263861	5264382	Yay.
5264422	5265904	What more can I say about that?
5266805	5267126	Nothing.
5268467	5268648	And...
5270751	5277017	That's it Question from our chatroom at chat.orange.com SSJ100 Matt says, do the bears wear a space poncho?
5277057	5282282	This is relevant to my interests No Oh, APB, coming out this week Really?
5282723	5295435	Awesome MMO game Plus, I love the fact that you pay for your time So it comes with 50 hours free If you play like I do, that will last you for a long, long, long time Yeah, about a week
5296834	5297835	Depends on who you are, I suppose.
5298315	5301878	But you can pay the time, or you can pay a more traditional monthly fee.
5301918	5305020	Yeah, you can pay a monthly fee, you can pay for just hours.
5305740	5306301	It's pretty cool.
5306701	5307582	And the game is pretty awesome.
5307602	5308422	Yeah, I was in the beta.
5308482	5309263	It was okay.
5309783	5313306	It needed a little bit more polish, but it looks like... Betas do.
5313526	5318829	Yeah, if you're a GTA or a Saints Row fan, you'll probably like it.
5319210	5322012	If you're not, you'll probably just be really confused by it.
5323075	5326517	Shall we go to Japan and check out the Japanese releases then, if Loki's all done?
5326597	5327017	We shall.
5327197	5327517	Alright.
5328117	5331199	Going to Japan and checking out what's coming out on their systems.
5331219	5334160	You know, sometimes they get stuff before we do, but sometimes they get stuff after we do.
5334560	5338462	BlazBlue Continuum Shift gets its release in Japan this week on July the 1st.
5338522	5341023	That comes in a limited edition or a version with a fighting stick.
5341204	5341764	Yay, high scores.
5342404	5345406	Big, big release on the 360 over there in Japan this week.
5345446	5349009	Going to the PlayStation 3, I think it's pretty much the same story.
5349049	5353592	Yeah, BlazBlue, Continuum Shift is also coming out over there.
5354512	5356313	That is also the big PS3 release.
5358415	5362498	White Knight Chronicles 2 is next week, though, and there's a part of me that's kind of like, wow, already?
5363198	5365980	Like, the first one didn't come out that long ago.
5366440	5368562	Anyhow, nothing new on the Wii this week.
5368602	5371203	That's kind of surprising, but there is no new games on the Wii this week.
5371744	5379489	Still some games coming out on the PlayStation 2, including Sacred Rider X-E-C-H-S.
5379629	5380730	I would say Shex.
5382931	5385173	I'll take Shex for 100, Alex.
5386994	5388375	Sacred Rider Shex.
5389724	5392446	I want to take your mother ass.
5392526	5394247	I'll take an old bum cover.
5394687	5396268	You ready for Orange Lounge Radio Tangent?
5396288	5399229	Because seriously, seriously, Jamie, this is like the funniest thing I saw all week.
5399389	5400630	The rapist for five bucks.
5400690	5404852	Next to the dog shitting at the Vuvuzela, this was the funniest thing I saw all week, okay?
5405873	5408554	There's Alex Trebek, I guess, on Jeopardy this week.
5408574	5411196	There was a category that was like auto-tune questions.
5411656	5412056	Oh no.
5412116	5414738	And so Alex Trebek's voice was all auto-tuned.
5415138	5416279	It was hilarious.
5416639	5416919	You gotta...
5418163	5419044	I'm going to have to YouTube that.
5419284	5420886	Tiger Claw will have a link in five seconds.
5420926	5421286	Just wait.
5421386	5422627	And we'll play it on the show here in a minute.
5422948	5423228	All right.
5425450	5428593	So Sacred Rider Shreks is coming out this week.
5429834	5431656	I don't know the rest of it, but my mother's a whore.
5435680	5437180	and Sacred Rider Shaxx.
5438441	5441422	Troops of otherworldly aliens are invading Earth.
5441922	5449484	To protect the planet and humanity, six chosen youths are recruited into the Sacred Rider team under you, their commander.
5450264	5453025	That's right, they are under me, their commander.
5453085	5454746	Why don't you get under, Shaxx?
5456166	5457186	Are you a bad enough dude?
5459547	5460247	Alright, joke's old.
5460807	5462748	I like it when my team is under me.
5464562	5466663	Moving on to the PSP.
5467563	5469023	Some games coming out on the PSP.
5470084	5474745	Hanayaka Kana Warega Ichizoku comes out on the PSP.
5475605	5482727	I don't have any clue what that game is, but it looks like a game about a train conductor and a samurai, if the box art is any...
5484764	5485124	I don't know.
5485304	5486825	I got nothing.
5487505	5491807	They're really pimping up those train sims, man.
5491867	5492968	Secretly they're friends.
5493008	5495409	And then one more, and then I got something for DarkSakura.
5496169	5497710	Oh, you wanted to see the box art for that game.
5497790	5498730	Oh, here we go.
5499751	5503273	Hanayaka Kanawarega Ichigosu.
5503293	5504733	See a train conductor and a samurai.
5504773	5505934	What's that look like to you?
5510697	5511518	Jamie knows some obscure shit.
5511538	5512999	I think that that's off of a manga.
5513619	5513900	Really?
5514540	5518764	But I know that there were a couple about... I think that that one's off of a manga.
5519725	5522867	So a samurai and a train conductor walk to a bar.
5523748	5527431	Also keep in mind that when trains... Here's another history lesson.
5527511	5531014	The very end of the samurai era in Japan...
5536098	5540742	was along the lines of the industrialization when they started getting train lines and everything.
5540822	5541823	So it makes sense.
5542084	5542364	All right.
5542444	5549170	So just so you guys know, the official Orange Lounge Radio Game of the Week we want released in the U.S.
5549290	5553194	because, you know, we were the show that started the whole President Cat thing.
5553674	5557258	So I think once in a while we do need to mention games that ought to come out here in the U.S.
5557538	5559660	I'm going to give that to Sacred Rider Shecksh.
5562721	5572606	Alex Meets Auto-Tune, you have to identify the song I am performing with technological help.
5572926	5575127	I have to try Alex Meets Auto-Tune 200.
5575527	5576388	Pay attention, players.
5576928	5578488	And the child takes the nurse.
5578849	5580169	The child takes the nurse.
5580890	5582130	I pull the carrier.
5582170	5583511	The child takes the nurse.
5584211	5584451	Paul.
5584671	5585752	What is The Farmer in the Dell?
5585932	5586112	Right.
5586952	5588313	Alex meets Autotune 400.
5588833	5589093	Listen.
5589773	5593014	I come from Alabama with my bench on my knee.
5593594	5596916	I'm going to Louisiana, my true love for to see.
5597796	5598056	Paul.
5598156	5599096	What is Oh Susanna?
5599296	5599697	Right.
5599777	5600597	Back to Autotune 600.
5600697	5611181	In the beauty of the sea, Christ was born across the sea with a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.
5611801	5612101	Paul.
5613596	5616398	What is the Battle Hymn of the Republic?
5616538	5618440	Oh, you got it in just in the nick of time.
5618480	5618880	Well done.
5619080	5620041	That's what she said.
5623643	5625104	I didn't even have to say it!
5629888	5630408	I'm sorry.
5630888	5631489	I give up.
5631609	5633170	I pass the crown to Loki.
5635111	5635452	I'm done.
5635752	5641416	I just think it's awfully sad that it took him that long to figure out what the song was.
5641880	5645244	Salacious Pop in our chat says, this is the worst thing I've ever heard.
5645304	5646105	Was this for real?
5646685	5653073	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
5655455	5656416	Shameless promotion.
5660160	5662601	Next week, we'll have the auto-tuned version.
5662921	5668744	One of the segments I always wanted to do on this program was Xtifer auto-tunes the Wii releases for the week.
5669484	5672766	And have the IMT, because there's an app on the iPhone called IMT Pain.
5673066	5680509	And we would actually have Xtifer sing what was coming out on virtual console for the week.
5680529	5681770	And then we would play that on the show.
5681810	5683231	But it just didn't work out.
5684592	5703087	Maybe in the future I am not opposed to Extifer and Autotune coming back for another segment on the show FUs of the week In Autotune Whole show in Autotune No Alright, DarkSakura, what's coming out in the UK?
5703800	5704200	Stuff.
5705281	5705521	Oh, yeah.
5705641	5706342	You want to know what stuff.
5707442	5711985	Arma 2, Operation Arrowhead, TNA Impact, Cross the Line.
5713086	5714107	Those are on the 29th.
5714847	5728075	On July 2nd, we have APB, Dragon Ball Origins 2, Pro Cycling Manager 2010, Tournament of Legends on Wii, Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 11, blah, blah.
5728636	5728956	That's it.
5730472	5734155	A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5734495	5739179	The game that DarkSakura says, hey, hey, listen, you should play this game.
5740040	5740940	Loki, what do you got for us?
5742382	5749567	Well, Microsoft, of course, didn't reveal anything 3D, I guess, this year.
5750808	5758815	But they're basically quoted as saying, we have the attitude that we're seeing what the adoption looks like of 3D.
5759435	5762216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5780243	5784164	It's really expensive and kind of unnecessary for 3D right now.
5784224	5786445	Unless you're going the route of 3DS.
5787025	5790286	Because I'm not buying a new TV for some fucking 3D game.
5790826	5793367	Nor am I buying really fucking expensive glasses.
5793527	5798429	And I seriously don't understand why they're not doing the fucking... What is it?
5798449	5805191	The Disney system that they have where those really cheap-ass glasses out there... I don't remember what it's called now.
5805471	5806611	But I've quoted it on the show.
5806851	5807352	I don't either.
5808152	5808252	Um...
5809453	5810113	Thanks for watching!
5828067	5833690	But the thing is, is that the cost of technology, especially in television, tends to fall down quick.
5834050	5842275	Like, I can remember a time only about four or five years ago where HD TVs cost shit tons of money like these 3D TVs do now.
5842375	5846257	I think in four or five years, 3D TVs will be fairly common.
5846457	5851700	And it makes sense for Sony to be pushing 3D in their gaming because they sell 3D TVs.
5852160	5853541	They're an electronics company.
5854181	5854801	Thanks for watching!
5876315	5877737	I mean, that's a big selling point.
5878277	5881680	And to add the 3D technology to it, I mean, it would be dumb not to do it.
5882041	5886125	But, is anyone, I mean, is everybody going to really jump on board with this?
5886865	5891870	Probably not, because honestly, yeah, it's kind of cool, Killzone 3 and stuff like that, but
5892891	5893632	Thanks for watching!
5911923	5939790	I gotta say the first time you see the 3DS you're gonna be like holy shit but I think even then you know even the 3DS is gonna be like okay it's a gimmick but it's a really good gimmick and I think especially the games to back up the gimmick are gonna make that system last but I think Nintendo's taking the right approach they're gonna make 3D affordable it's just they're gonna go on a smaller scale with it and if that's not for you you don't have to use it you don't have to use the 3D and at the end of the day it's just a more powerful gaming system for them
5942071	5950513	I think Microsoft will just wait until the next cycle of the game consoles, the Xbox 720, if you will, before they jump in on this.
5950553	5951133	I don't think so.
5951193	5952073	And here's why.
5952113	5954814	It's because they already have games that support 3D.
5955294	5960036	Not necessarily that they're going to be jumping on board with everything supporting 3D.
5960076	5963857	Game companies out there right now can use 3D.
5963877	5966418	For example, Avatar that came out on Xbox 360.
5967338	5967878	and DarkSakura.
5992717	5998443	All those Sony will like to spin it that it's going to be 3D on their system to make it seem like it's not going to be on the other systems.
5998543	6002127	But, I mean, it's capable of doing it.
6002447	6008253	It's just they may not be just jumping on board with the, oh, look at all these games that are in 3D.
6008594	6010816	Like you probably won't see any Xbox Live Arcade games come out 3D.
6012197	6038950	DarkTetsuya says I do want to see Tron in 3D though I want to see Geometry Wars updated for 3D BlackWolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio says force feedback in a controller was also a gimmick just saying, but it was a cheap gimmick still is a gimmick no, I get what you're saying though I do think though the whole 3D thing
6041648	6042589	It'll be cute for a while.
6042689	6044930	You remember when Sony... Never forget!
6045170	6049191	You remember when Sony said, Hey, force feedback's just crap.
6049251	6050232	We didn't really need it.
6050532	6051132	I do remember.
6051172	6052173	Yeah, it's overrated.
6052233	6052773	You don't need this.
6052953	6055474	Because they, you know, didn't pay somebody for the rights.
6055494	6058055	We were the pioneers of force feedback, but you know what?
6058235	6060917	That is so last gen.
6062352	6065853	That was so 1998, okay?
6066113	6069674	This is the PS3, bitches.
6069734	6071354	It's all about Six Axis now.
6071434	6073694	How many of those games support Six Axis?
6074035	6074915	Oh yeah, not a lot.
6076715	6079076	Six Axis now, that's a cheap gimmick right there.
6079896	6084517	But hey, thanks to Six Axis, I can move my head around in LittleBigPlanet.
6084537	6088778	Yes, thanks to Six Axis, I can wave my little fake hand in LittleBigPlanet.
6088818	6090258	What an amazing fucking feature.
6092682	6096403	Alright, one story I got for you guys and we'll get to the classic game of the week.
6096483	6109367	Nintendo has made an admission, oh my god, and heaven forbid, it's Reggie Fils-Aimé talking to Kotaku has said, we look at what we do well, we look at what we don't do so well.
6109907	6110267	DarkSakura.com
6130959	6131480	Good job.
6132001	6132922	Let's applaud.
6132942	6136126	The first step is admitting that you have a problem.
6136266	6138029	Good job, Nintendo.
6139010	6139511	Thank you.
6139531	6139771	11 to go.
6144430	6148994	I think we all know that Nintendo just throw the damn friend codes thing out.
6149034	6150255	Just copy Xbox.
6150655	6153577	Fuck, Microsoft's been copying you for how long, Nintendo?
6153957	6155579	How long have they been copying you?
6155919	6157600	Just steal from them.
6157900	6159221	It's okay.
6159542	6168448	We will forgive you because you'll still be giving us Kirby and Donkey Kong and you'll get up on stage and say, and here's a new game, and here's a new game, and it'll be fine.
6170069	6171190	Just steal Xbox Live.
6171230	6171570	It's fine.
6172451	6173292	Nobody's going to give you shit.
6175757	6185749	Alright, now's that part of the show where we're going to take a step back in gaming's history and DarkSakura is going to open up the vault and say, hey!
6187731	6206671	Hey listen, you kids Hey, listen Are playing these newfangled 3D games in your Kinect But you know what, you need to take a minute Or five, or twenty To go back and play a classic game It's DarkSakura's classic game of the week What have you picked for the lovely audience tonight?
6207273	6211995	The game of the night is Die Hard Arcade, a.k.a.
6212175	6213016	Dynamite DECA.
6213596	6214977	Yippee-ki-yay.
6214997	6217138	Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
6218038	6224061	So, yeah, basically, the game has the guys landing on, you know, a...
6225322	6234166	A building, and the main hero, his name was actually, what was his name, Bruno, I think.
6236287	6237067	Bruno Dellinger.
6237307	6242910	Anyway, but he looked a lot like the character of John McClane, so they made it, they said it worked.
6243390	6247992	And he's also landing on a building and fighting his way through the building to save the president's daughter from terrorists.
6249233	6250433	It's always the president's daughter.
6250934	6251754	I know, what'd she do?
6253274	6266619	But you have different quick time events in there and different cut scenes so you'd have to hit a button in a particular time limit to defeat the enemy or you'd have to, you know, so that you can avoid, you know, actually taking extra time to fight them.
6266940	6268660	So it actually plays though like a little brawler.
6269761	6270201	Like a...
6271858	6274019	I've never played this, but it's very Final Fight-ish.
6274219	6274459	Yeah.
6276360	6279161	But it's room-to-room type of thing.
6280482	6287044	And also, it was out for the AM1 systems when it was out in the arcades.
6287765	6290526	And it was also partially developed by Sonic Team.
6291386	6293067	You know, the amazing Sonic Team.
6294240	6301725	At any rate, the sequel, Dynamite DECA 2, came out on Dreamcast as Dynamite Cop.
6303066	6308349	And it actually, to draw another parallel, it actually resembled Speed 2 Cruise Control.
6308569	6310370	Here's some of the sequel here we've got.
6310870	6312792	I think it was really cool.
6313312	6315313	We've actually got Dynamite DECA 2.
6316053	6319015	Why would somebody try to emulate Speed 2 Cruise Control?
6319275	6319736	No idea.
6319756	6319836	Yeah.
6322817	6344419	but um with the sequel it's you know more having to save people but you also have a female character in that one so instead of just the two dudes and you can um you can actually uh handcuff them as you're going through the game too so it's it's just a fun good old punch them in the gut game
6347471	6354454	As far as other versions, Sega Ages on PS2 had a Die Hard Arcade version.
6355054	6360696	But, I mean, honestly, and for the record, Die Hard Arcade actually came out on the Saturn.
6362268	6366011	So, of course, it stands to reason that Dynamite Cop would be on Dreamcast.
6366892	6368132	I like the disco floor in that one.
6369373	6372636	But, yeah, they're just a couple of really fun games.
6374157	6376979	I'll put this under Dynamite DECA series.
6377639	6382083	All right, the Dynamite DECA series, but you might notice Die Hard Arcade on the Sega Saturn.
6382523	6385585	And Dynamite Cop on the Dreamcast.
6385866	6388167	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6389788	6390109	Enjoy.
6391518	6396642	Go beat some people up in the context of a video game.
6396862	6400004	However, don't just go outside and beat people up because that would be wrong.
6401745	6404307	Although, I don't know, maybe DarkSakura would approve of that depending on what they're saying.
6404827	6407229	I do not advocate going and beating people up.
6408610	6408850	Really?
6409851	6413553	I agree with hitting idiots over the head with the thin end of a fishing pole.
6414679	6419001	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, you guys, and we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6419021	6420802	We have plenty more to come in Part B tonight.
6421343	6424204	We have some more stories for you guys, some quick stories, of course.
6424224	6426326	We're going to do Twitter topics, so make sure you get those in.
6426886	6431649	We're going to be talking about new plans for the FBI to step up anti-piracy.
6431669	6433450	We're going to make Loki talk about that tonight.
6433470	6433970	That'll be fun.
6434330	6437272	Lots of comic book related stories coming too, so stay tuned, guys.
6437612	6441034	We will be right back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6447111	6473107	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio We are here live taping our 372nd episode I think if I got count correctly Yes, 372 Here for June the 27th of 2010 Which is technically our 8th anniversary show You know 8 is just one of those numbers It's like, you know, 8's not that special Unless you're talking about the old show 8 is enough Or 8 is enough, alright
6473627	6498327	Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news here of course I do want to make sure I plug real quick Because something I didn't talk about during my gaming week But one of the other games I played was Pinball this week Pinball FX, specifically on the Xbox 360 Because the big battle is going on right now I don't know if you heard over at All Games I believe the folks at Dead Pixel Live are really kind of the brains behind this But they're putting together this whole big battle between the various shows
6498967	6519865	And I believe some of the events just wrapped up I think the Soldner X and the Battlefield Bad Company ones were supposed to be ending this weekend So I think they are done I haven't heard anything about the results because I've been out of town But from what I understand, at least what the leaderboards say right now Dead Pixel Live is in first place with 108 points Guess how many points we have?
6520546	6521467	Zero Six
6524449	6535777	Okay, I'm just going to chalk that up to the fact that, you know, we got on this a little late and our listeners probably don't really have the Soldier X2 and the Battlefield Bad Company, but look, we can do better, OL Army, at the pinball games.
6535957	6548265	So, Zen Pinball, the Earth Defense Force table, that's on PS3, and Pinball FX, the Buccaneer table on the Xbox 360, those are on the systems that are going on right now.
6548745	6549726	So, check it out.
6550006	6554488	Now YYR in chat says, ugh, I tried registering for the big battle on Friday and I never got the friend request.
6554508	6556069	I would have been first on Soldner X2.
6556529	6559070	Unfortunately, dude, you might have just got in a little late.
6559170	6560171	And you know what?
6560331	6570876	Let's not forget, and I think one kind of like oopsie mistake that might have been made with this whole thing is that it was set up during E3, and then I think Derek, who was kind of putting this together, went to E3.
6571396	6577259	So, you know, there might have been some kinks in it the past couple weeks, but it will be better, I'm hoping.
6577927	6579208	I'm sorry about that, YYR.
6579268	6581329	Maybe we'll have to contest the results.
6581409	6581769	I don't know.
6583470	6584990	I don't know if I want to put up a stink, though.
6585951	6588252	I know these things are a pain in the butt to run, though.
6588692	6588952	All right.
6590253	6596276	Anyhow, but do sign up for the other competitions, at least the Zen Pinball and Pinball FX.
6596416	6597416	Actually, I'm looking.
6598096	6601098	YYR, there might be a reprieve because I'm looking on the main website.
6601138	6602098	It says Soldner X2 is...
6603579	6605462	July 9th, 2010 now.
6605523	6607526	So I think that might have been extended.
6608007	6608448	YYR.
6608728	6610010	So it might not be over yet.
6610391	6617143	That just might be the results from Battlefield Bad Company or something where I know we had one guy saying they were going to play.
6619125	6620646	So they probably got six points.
6621007	6622188	So thank you whoever played.
6622568	6623869	So YYR might not be over yet.
6623909	6626531	It looks like he might have extended it a week because of all the E3 madness.
6626551	6627312	So that's cool.
6627672	6631115	But anyway, you have until the 16th of July to do Zen Pinball and Pinball FX.
6631455	6639622	So that's thebigbattle.net or I believe another way to access that is bigbattle.allgames.com And YYR says, I will double my score.
6641343	6641643	That's right.
6641663	6642104	You show them.
6643244	6643805	I'll double mine.
6643825	6644165	Show them.
6644525	6645706	I'll double mine.
6645887	6646887	Zero times zero is zero.
6649881	6650161	All right.
6652103	6652623	Let's see.
6652943	6653504	Oh, Zappy.
6653544	6656626	Yes, Zappy is a good buddy at Dead Pixel Live and he's in the chat.
6656666	6658087	How was the Zappy show?
6658147	6659588	I didn't get to hear because I was at E3.
6659968	6664372	But he says, remember Derek's email is radio at deadpixellive.com if you want to know where to complain.
6664472	6671537	So YYR, if you're mad and your results don't show up, I would file an official grievance with Derek.
6672117	6693791	but it honestly looks like he just extended it out and that's cool maybe he realized that E3 was not the best time of the year to start something like this alright, anyhow, let's move on I'm going to work on my pinball scores this week so you guys should too I see all of you on my friends list I know the UL Army can do well at pinball what lady?
6695652	6696513	I've been playing real pinball
6698223	6699244	Like actual pinball tables?
6699385	6701568	Hey, Pinball FX and Zen Pinball is fun pinball.
6702209	6702749	Give it a try.
6703070	6704252	What real pinball have you been playing?
6705213	6705974	World Cup Soccer 94.
6706034	6712563	Since I can't make myself sit down to watch the real World Cup, I've just been living vicariously through pinball.
6713264	6713585	Cool!
6717032	6735382	and Revenge for Mars Zappy in our chatroom says the Zappy show got cancelled by work and other problems that's unfortunate it was replaced by the Vuvuzela show actually all week long during E3
6735987	6740332	Dance Central, a game that was shown off by Harmonix during the Microsoft Press Conference.
6754048	6756150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6786540	6787000	I don't know.
6808250	6812313	Monkey Island 2 is available on Steam, or at least you can pre-order it.
6812934	6817037	And what's awesome, though, is if you do pre-order it, you get the first one for free.
6817438	6821942	And that's awesome, because both those games are excellent, and you should definitely check them out.
6823223	6825445	The game will be launched on July 7th.
6826165	6832971	If you happen to pre-order it before then, you will get The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition for absolutely nothing.
6834639	6835259	I like Free.
6835900	6836520	Free is good.
6836741	6837681	Both games are awesome.
6838582	6839322	Definitely check it out.
6841144	6848950	And last but not least, Yut Sato has teased the possibility that Seaman may be returning on 3DS.
6850030	6854594	Soon you will be able to request that he friend your butt in full 3D.
6855194	6857756	If you don't know what we're talking about, please go back and listen to last week's show.
6857776	6859117	I think it came up at the very, very end.
6859197	6860198	Or maybe that was in the afterbirth.
6860438	6862640	No, I think we played the thing in the afterbirth that it came up on the show.
6863160	6863561	There you go.
6864923	6865304	Excellent.
6865764	6868489	Alright, some more news for you guys.
6868549	6876282	I wonder since it does have a human face on the front, if you can capture your face for the Seaman.
6878183	6879983	So you could be your own seaman.
6881404	6882544	You could friend your own butt.
6882804	6883084	Okay.
6885685	6887305	I bet there's a lot of people that would like to do that.
6887685	6888505	Alright, moving on.
6890146	6892666	Rock band news and the songs that are coming out this week.
6892726	6893206	Guess what?
6893266	6894867	Coming out June 29th.
6895327	6898027	It is all about Nickelback.
6906374	6907555	I thought this was not 2002.
6909356	6914319	Burn it to the ground, figured you out, never again, photograph, rock star in this afternoon.
6914379	6916921	All of those songs are coming to Rock Band this week.
6917321	6919342	Do you know what version of photograph they should do?
6919683	6919903	What?
6920443	6921204	The Def Leppard.
6922664	6926027	And this will forever be known as the week that Rock Band sucked.
6927147	6927748	Sorry, guys.
6928068	6929429	Now with jumping shark action.
6930665	6934206	MDK 2 is going to be released on WiiWare.
6934246	6935186	Remember MDK?
6935246	6936986	This game came out years ago.
6937647	6938427	Years ago.
6938547	6940207	I didn't realize it was a BioWare game.
6941047	6941567	Go figure.
6941967	6944788	Well, it's an action slash shooter slash puzzle.
6944968	6945448	You know what?
6945468	6946388	It was a really cool game.
6946488	6948229	And it's going to be coming out on WiiWare, apparently.
6949029	6954410	And they're also going to be releasing one on the PC via what's called the Beamdog Distribution Service.
6954470	6957691	I've never heard of this, but it was founded by somebody who used to work with BioWare.
6957771	6958951	So, big surprise there.
6959671	6964116	So, now, by the way, MDK2, that was kind of a game that was out before.
6964757	6966779	You can get that on Steam or good old games.
6966939	6968781	Those are available in both places there.
6968801	6969582	I like the first one.
6969662	6972465	I'm not too big of a fan of the second one, though.
6973266	6974828	All right, well, this is something pretty cool.
6974848	6979713	A little YouTube that was kind of circulating the Internet, and it even made its way to Loki's Twitter.
6979733	6980193	Yeah!
6981114	6995792	And it's this guy, he's playing Team Fortress 2 And apparently this Team Fortress 2 level had a giant cat That would shoot lasers out of his eyes And there were bees in the level Yeah, this is some server that I guess you can play on
6996633	7003157	It's basically an achievement map that you can run to play different things.
7003277	7011141	But the guy that created the map also created a special trigger that you can trigger by firing in the corner of one of the spots in the map there.
7011641	7015984	And that cat will come out and just destroy everything.
7016244	7016984	Oh my god, bees!
7017024	7017925	But it's hilarious.
7017985	7019105	He shoots bees at you.
7019185	7020346	That's not a nice thing to do.
7020766	7026300	There's a different video of that same thing, though, where this guy is getting sucked into the cat's mouth.
7026641	7027263	It's awesome.
7027870	7029431	Why do I never play this game?
7029691	7030612	I like Team Fortress 2.
7031133	7033074	It was dirt cheap on Steam for a while, Rob.
7033094	7033935	It still is.
7034015	7034996	It's on sale.
7035016	7035756	It's in the orange box.
7035776	7036757	I've got Team Fortress 2.
7036817	7037938	I'm going to have to pick it up.
7037958	7038378	You guys need to play.
7038398	7039399	Do you want to play Team Fortress 2 together?
7039419	7040840	Because I bet we'd both suck at it.
7040860	7041320	Oh, my God, yes.
7041340	7041701	Come on.
7041741	7042101	Come on.
7042141	7042762	I'll teach you.
7042782	7043782	I play still.
7043802	7044743	But you know who I took?
7044803	7049167	There's two characters I totally want to play, and one is the spy, and the other one's the scout.
7049207	7049427	All right.
7049587	7050267	We're going to play this game.
7050287	7050948	We're going to play it.
7051068	7051388	For real.
7051488	7051789	For real.
7052089	7053930	This week, we're playing Team Fortress 2.
7053970	7054671	We just shook on it.
7056192	7056912	DarkSakura.
7057072	7059713	The same way we're going to open my two magic decks and play them, huh?
7060173	7061513	No, we didn't shake on that.
7061573	7062534	We shook on this, though.
7062834	7063434	That's happening.
7063974	7064274	All right.
7065455	7067015	No going backs on shakies.
7067035	7067675	That's right.
7067975	7068335	You know what?
7068355	7070816	We're going to go back and play a game like it's 2007, y'all.
7074257	7076678	Did Drunami bring a magic deck with him?
7077338	7078818	That's my high school deck.
7079118	7080179	I need to double check this.
7083299	7083579	All right.
7083599	7084660	Green, red?
7084680	7085080	Fires.
7086294	7090437	DarkSakura, stop playing with the magic deck and do your quick news.
7090957	7093378	Then we'll get to the tweeter topics.
7094419	7096020	Well, I approve of that deck, by the way.
7096040	7099342	That's the same type of deck I would have played when I was in college the first time.
7101725	7110810	So, as far as news goes, Final Fantasy Tactics is coming out for the iPhone and iPod Touch on the 15th of September.
7111350	7116232	Don't know how much it is, but it's gonna be out.
7116352	7118914	So for those who liked it, yay for you.
7119034	7122315	I don't like it, but I'm not a Tactics fan.
7123796	7124637	Yay for you.
7129907	7131829	Rob, I can never be anybody but me.
7132130	7134172	I do love the way you report news on this show.
7134332	7138057	I don't give a shit, but if you like it, then yay for you.
7138077	7140760	If you're into crap, then you like crap.
7140820	7141461	Have fun.
7141861	7145105	I will never say that Final Fantasy Tactics is crap.
7145686	7147508	However, I'm not a tactics fan.
7148341	7165107	I like tactics I wouldn't consider myself a foamy at the mouth raving fanboy but I like it and I would once the iPhone 4 comes out with a processor well I mean I'm sorry it's out once I'm able to actually get one without having to wait in a five hour long line I will pick up the game probably
7166187	7177875	Well, in other news too, EA requested a trademark application for Alice Madness Returns.
7178916	7180337	We have an American McGee fan.
7181849	7182149	I love you.
7205425	7206687	Okay, I need to go back and watch them.
7207108	7212055	Yes, but the ones... That's where that went.
7212656	7217303	The last episodic thing on YouTube I watched any of, Rob, was Hope is Emo.
7219720	7220581	Marvel Costume Packs
7241980	7246662	So, and from what I can see on this little silhouette thing, I definitely see a Wolverine.
7248223	7249944	I see a Storm.
7250224	7251745	I see a Dr. Octopus.
7251785	7252825	I see a Spider-Man.
7253466	7254486	I see a Human Torch.
7255807	7257488	There's bound to be a Captain America.
7257548	7258608	There's an Iron Man.
7259509	7261189	I know my Marvel shit well too much.
7261210	7263991	They had a Captain America.
7264011	7266392	They showed off some of the costumes a while back.
7266932	7268313	And I know there was a Captain America in there.
7268713	7290160	Captain America, Daredevil, Doctor Octopus, Electra, Ghost Rider, Green Goblin, Hulk, Invisible Woman, Iron Man, Human Torch, Magneto, Mystique, The Punisher, Rogue, Spider-Man, Storm, The Thing, Thor, Venom, and Wolverine And a partridge in a pear tree My two favorite characters are not on this list
7294577	7295098	Deadpool, Blasphemy
7308806	7308946	Poo!
7326914	7335559	Oh, and by the way, plug, plug, plug, my interview with Jim McCann, who is the writer of Hawkeye and Mockingbird, is on geeklife.com.
7336700	7339962	Geeklife had the interview with the naked chick, too?
7339982	7341543	Yeah, the naked gamer.
7341723	7342164	Yeah.
7342724	7342964	Yeah.
7343224	7343785	There you go.
7344025	7345245	That was ratings right there.
7345305	7345746	Good job.
7346206	7350749	geek-life.com I left an uber comment on one of the stories this week.
7350789	7351750	You guys were reminiscing.
7351770	7352790	I don't know if you were in it, Jamie.
7352810	7353331	I can't remember.
7353371	7355072	But you guys were reminiscing about classic films.
7355372	7356933	Yes, I picked Transformers the movie.
7357133	7357574	Ah, that's right.
7357594	7358414	I do remember reading that.
7358834	7362617	I left an epic comment about my love of a certain 80s movie.
7362997	7363818	I was going to pick Xanadu.
7365606	7367107	I wish I'd been able to go Xanadu Xanadu
7383211	7386093	Alright, are we done with the quick fire news here, rapid fire news?
7386673	7387314	Um, yeah.
7387434	7392477	Alright, we're gonna get to Twitter topics, but first, I needed to play this for DarkSakura.
7392557	7393778	I'm sorry guys, I have to.
7394958	7397060	She is waiting in her bed to be murdered by her husband.
7397220	7398361	Hold on, let me start this over.
7398801	7400622	Meet Desdemona from Shakespeare's Othello.
7400942	7403064	She is waiting in her bed to be murdered by her husband.
7403424	7405945	This fate could have been avoided if she had a sassy gay friend.
7406125	7407006	What are you doing?
7407486	7407767	What?
7408227	7408507	What?
7408947	7409948	What are you doing?
7414002	7415343	Othello has ordered me to bed.
7415523	7419687	Yeah, well he's also ordered a pillow at Bed Bath and Beyond that's good for smothering.
7419747	7423030	So Tina Turner, we gotta private dance it outta here.
7423250	7424211	Why would he do that?
7424451	7425812	I have been faithful to him.
7426173	7429876	I know that, and you know that, but somehow your handkerchief ended up at Cassio's place.
7430677	7434961	So now Othello thinks your fingers have been all over Cassio's keyboard, so we gotta go!
7435421	7437783	I can understand why Othello would think that.
7438083	7438363	What?
7439004	7440665	First of all, stop saying Othello.
7440765	7441685	It sounds pretentious.
7441986	7443287	Second of all, what?
7443887	7448030	Some guy ends up with your handkerchief so your husband gets to murder you?
7448390	7448630	No.
7449091	7450952	I gave a cough drop to King Lear last week.
7450972	7452093	Does that mean I had sex with him?
7452373	7452613	No.
7452953	7454955	And I never would, because one, he's crazy.
7455095	7456336	Two, he wears pleated pants.
7456636	7457897	Why are you still in the bed?
7457957	7458878	All right, okay, you're right.
7458898	7459278	I'll go with you.
7459298	7459598	This is great.
7459618	7460239	I'll go with you.
7460839	7461239	Goodness.
7461580	7462780	Othello called me, though.
7462800	7463281	Oh, God.
7464713	7466535	He said I was false as hell.
7467236	7468377	False as hell?
7468798	7470059	Wow, he is black.
7470740	7472763	Speaking of which, does more mean more?
7473483	7475346	Oh, okay, now I'm being racist.
7475566	7476807	I'm such a stupid bitch.
7477588	7478910	I'm a stupid bitch.
7483069	7483530	There you go.
7483590	7484251	Now you've seen it.
7485613	7487896	By the way, that's the funniest one by far.
7488197	7489419	Otello's the funniest one.
7489699	7490841	Don't bother with the new one.
7490881	7491342	It's terrible.
7491422	7496770	What we need to do is harness the energy now from William Shakespeare rolling in his grave.
7496970	7498532	We could power this show for a year.
7503155	7518324	Alright, I apologize for ruining the show with Sassy Gayfriend Don't say it's hella, it makes you sound pretentious Look what I started That's gonna be me at work tomorrow Don't say that, it makes you sound pretentious Why are you still in the bed?
7518905	7522547	Alright Hey, how about the tweets?
7527196	7531198	Twitter.com slash OLR is where you can follow us on Twitter.
7531718	7533279	And you can send us some tweets.
7533399	7534159	Show us your tweets.
7534779	7536060	We like it when you show us your tweets.
7536960	7539341	Some folks are tweeting us stories we already talked about tonight.
7539421	7540402	So thank you.
7540442	7543923	Actually, we're going to get to some of these in a little bit, like the story that Alpha Pananagram linked us.
7543943	7544964	We're going to get to that in just a minute.
7546324	7546965	But let's see.
7547245	7549226	Jackson Man is passing along a congrats.
7549986	7550787	Been a fan since 2004.
7551708	7552329	Love you guys.
7552409	7554993	You all make getting older easier to deal with.
7555594	7556795	That's actually a really nice compliment.
7558067	7562529	YYR wants us to know, Sharpshooter and Falling Score contests are open.
7562630	7564991	Win $20 in Microsoft Points.
7565171	7566572	Both games now available.
7566652	7573996	Details at www.yyrgames.com So Sharpshooter, I guess, got released finally.
7574016	7574436	That's good.
7574716	7581159	Because he was showing that off at PAX East and looked kind of like the Hogan's Alley-ish kind of game, if you remember those.
7581360	7583601	I don't want to say maybe point blank, but a little bit like that.
7584329	7585090	That sounds like fun.
7585470	7585951	So check that out.
7586011	7588113	I like shooting games that don't have a dog laughing at you.
7588313	7590595	Those are indie games on Xbox Live, by the way.
7590615	7591576	You don't play them on the web.
7591596	7593017	You have to download them on the Xbox.
7593037	7594118	But they're super cheap.
7594158	7595599	Like, falling was like a buck.
7596500	7603186	Alright, Blade 3 says it would be cool if you could explain this whole iPhone 4 death grip thing I keep hearing about.
7603427	7607791	Okay, I don't have an iPhone 4, but I... Yes?
7608786	7610307	Dan and I actually wrote a press release about this.
7610527	7611909	Okay.
7612629	7616272	Basically, if you hold your iPhone forward in a particular way, you lose all reception.
7617113	7617993	It's just by holding it.
7618013	7619354	It doesn't matter what way you're pointing.
7619815	7620915	It matters how you hold it.
7621316	7624899	So when that was brought up to the powers that be, they said, Sorry.
7626320	7626960	In the press release.
7627861	7628161	Sorry.
7628661	7628942	What?
7630343	7630503	Yeah.
7630523	7630603	Yeah.
7631260	7631701	and DarkSakura.com
7647752	7658259	Uh, alright, Redertainment tweets us, has Consumer Reports looked at the new 360 Slim, don't call it that, comparing it to the older 360 and the PS3 in relation to error rates and graphics?
7658639	7659740	I don't know if they've had time.
7659980	7662662	Like, a lot of those types of things take time to really test.
7663142	7666384	So I don't know if they've really figured that out yet, but as far as Consumer Reports goes, no.
7666944	7671627	I would love to hear though if the 360 has as bad of a failure rate, but we're not going to know for a year.
7672307	7674008	You know, it takes a little while for those things to fail.
7674168	7674468	I doubt it.
7674488	7674889	Give it a week.
7675589	7676429	That's true.
7676529	7679051	My first Xbox I ever had failed in days.
7679231	7680011	Well, here's the thing.
7680292	7683413	They've already been showing some stuff about it.
7683533	7688236	It will shut off if it gets too hot before it gets to the fail point.
7688676	7689116	Thanks for watching!
7711161	7712622	So that was our last tweet, by the way.
7713023	7716827	Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet to read in a future week.
7717527	7721571	Alpha Cananagram in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com says, It's antenna basics.
7721711	7724454	Don't touch antenna on radios else you lose reception.
7726356	7728918	But are these people not using cases?
7729219	7731000	Maybe because the cases aren't really out yet?
7731141	7731461	Is that...
7732742	7735042	I mean, because I don't have a... Well, I don't know.
7735082	7744384	Because they were fucking geniuses and put the antenna and the metals on the actual case instead of keeping it internal like everybody else.
7744484	7755546	I'm hearing about how they show the actual bars dropping, but I'm not hearing about, especially from my friends that own them and are using them, oh shit, I can't make calls because I'm not allowed to hold my phone.
7755726	7756906	I'm not hearing any of that.
7756986	7760167	I'm just hearing, oh, the indicator dropped from four to two bars.
7761167	7764490	But I'm not hearing anyone saying, and it's affecting the quality of my call.
7765050	7767332	No, AT&T is just affecting the quality of your call.
7767512	7770034	Well, that's a whole other issue.
7770455	7771115	It's a feature.
7771576	7772156	It's a feature.
7773297	7774658	It teaches you patience.
7775619	7777360	Let's move on with some other news.
7777881	7780363	Loki, I can't wait to hear you talk about this next story.
7781574	7782654	Ah, yes, the White House.
7782674	7803158	They're planning on increasing FBI anti-piracy by employing over 50 special agents exclusively devoted to pursuing intellectual property investigations operating in field offices throughout the country and for enhanced intellectual property squads.
7805059	7805839	Ah, yes.
7805859	7807319	You know what's hilarious?
7807639	7809700	Kind of sort of ties in with this, I guess.
7810380	7810460	Um,
7812032	7815494	There's a lot of piracy out there with BitTorrent and then, of course, Usenet.
7815874	7822297	There was a website that I used to browse called Newsbin, one of the proprietors of the NZB format.
7824158	7829501	They got in this big old lawsuit with MPA and stuff like that and got shut down.
7830521	7831082	I check it today.
7831422	7833223	NZB, or what was it?
7834403	7836665	It was Newsbin 2 is back.
7836845	7837425	So it's like...
7839531	7840832	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7861397	7861998	Oh, okay.
7862578	7868785	It'll be interesting to hear how that kind of affects, because don't most of these, if not all of these, pirate the huge operations run overseas?
7870087	7877374	True, and I would think, if anything, these guys are going to be going after probably actual pirate... well, not actual piracy...
7878155	7879216	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
7901969	7902750	That would be my guess.
7903431	7904052	I could be wrong.
7904212	7906094	Maybe they're going to be employed by the NPA.
7906334	7907035	That would make sense.
7907495	7908517	But, I mean...
7910370	7910630	Great!
7910810	7912191	More jobs, I guess.
7914873	7921597	And of course, the ESA, President Michael Gallagher, is very happy that they're doing this.
7922017	7932304	We deeply appreciate the efforts of Vice President Biden and the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in their leadership and vision in this critical area.
7932864	7938228	We also applaud the numerous federal departments and agencies that are committed to protecting intellectual property rights.
7939308	7948631	Here and in foreign markets, both of which are critical to our industry's continued growth and ability to deliver innovative entertainment experiences.
7951032	7957475	So, as Andrew said, it's not going to stop anything.
7957715	7959295	It's not going to slow down anything.
7959955	7961156	It's really not going to do anything.
7961536	7963337	But hey, 50 people have a job.
7964137	7964257	Cool.
7964277	7964377	Cool.
7966539	7967460	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7987378	7988520	DC Comics PlayStation Network
8002640	8003040	That's right.
8003100	8005582	It makes sense because DC Universe is coming out soon.
8005622	8006623	So this is kind of one of those.
8006663	8007184	Well, of course.
8007664	8018032	So DC Comics is actually coming to the PlayStation Network and you'll actually be able to use the PSP Digital Reader to read between 99 cents and $3 an issue over 80 different titles.
8018512	8019373	Batman Hush.
8019833	8040323	Green Lantern Rebirth also I guess there's an exclusive comic available on the PSN it is God of War and they're going to be doing a Resistance comic and Free Realms and I guess a joint Superman Batman title that's only on PSN kind of interesting there's a free 10 page preview of the 700th issue of Superman available on the store now
8041658	8042878	Not a fan, DarkSakura?
8042978	8044679	I'm not a DC fan.
8045599	8056901	The only thing that made me remotely interested in reading anything DC was The Blackest Night, and I tried to read that, and I was like, this is stupid.
8058981	8066543	I liked some of the writing, I thought it was kind of neat, but for the most part, I just look at most DC stuff and go, brain hurt, miss my Marvel.
8067600	8068801	So, yeah.
8084736	8089738	I just don't like... I... I will... Okay, okay.
8090138	8092839	I have to explain what my love-hate with DC is.
8092919	8093259	Alright.
8094479	8095459	They have great characters.
8096620	8097540	Shitty storylines.
8099060	8101361	Reinvent the universe every, you know, five minutes.
8103182	8107943	And I'm like, at least Marvel tries to maintain some degree of continuity along their lines.
8108403	8109284	One of the comics?
8110104	8110264	Huh?
8110284	8110344	Huh?
8111993	8137243	they try to have continuity in at least one of the comics the other ones go batshit crazy though we have a set universe for this one there are other universes and sometimes they cross over a little bit but you're not completely reinventing the main universe that the stories are told in and on top of that, honestly, they have some really hokey characters and I just could not get into it
8137543	8138984	and if you like DC, good for you.
8139124	8139884	I'm glad you like it.
8140245	8140865	Make mine Marvel.
8141725	8143787	I will say though, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 looks pretty sweet.
8144167	8144907	Hell yeah.
8145347	8149410	Jamie, don't worry if there's a continuity snarl in DC.
8149890	8152091	They'll just have Superboy Prime punch reality.
8154152	8159015	No, next time they decide that they don't like the universe, they'll just have another crisis or whatever the crap they do.
8160101	8166343	Salacious Pop in our chatroom says DC equals meh, DC Vertigo equals A++++ Vertigo, yes.
8166743	8174285	Vertigo, now I love, I have the Sandman book that Amano did the art for.
8175545	8177226	I love The High Cost of Living.
8177606	8179046	That was one of my favorites.
8179286	8182627	I am totally down with the Vertigo books.
8183107	8192517	But the main DC, the only thing that I have ever really, and this is my one thing that made me happy, was just Batman and his thing complaining about everybody.
8192557	8193538	It says, do they know who I am?
8193599	8194520	I'm the goddamn Batman.
8195340	8196201	And he hates chocolate.
8196862	8201667	And Flaming Toilet in our chat room says, all Marvel does is have their flagship character make a deal with the devil.
8202228	8202448	Nope.
8203910	8204090	Nope.
8204490	8204630	Nope.
8204771	8204911	Nope.
8205934	8207056	Alright, let's move on.
8207156	8213804	I will say I'm not as happy with the Spider-Man books as I used to be, but Spider-Man and the Avengers is freaking sweet.
8214425	8215126	Alright, let's move on.
8215166	8216948	DarkSakura, you got another news story for us.
8216988	8219451	It has nothing to do with comic books, but it's still cool.
8220132	8220993	I think, anyway.
8221273	8223136	When I heard about this, I was like, oh, cool.
8223872	8225133	This is pretty cool.
8225853	8231436	Basically, the silver lining is actually going to be complete.
8231676	8232216	That's pretty cool.
8232236	8233197	It's Phoenix Online.
8234917	8239840	We're working on this, actually, as a King's Quest sequel, and we talked with them, and we thought they were cool.
8239860	8240280	Yeah, they were.
8240880	8242041	Do we have them on the show?
8242081	8242801	I can't even remember.
8242841	8244282	I know I went to one of their pressy things.
8244322	8246623	I think we did have them on the show years ago.
8246643	8246983	We did.
8247504	8250125	This was before the first time they got shut down by Vivendi.
8250666	8252007	Yeah.
8252387	8254409	Anyway, there's actually, the website is up.
8254589	8261934	It's www.tsl-game.com and they basically are coming back.
8261954	8265697	They have a release date of July 10th and made the big statement about it.
8266638	8279227	And so now it's not, you know, still not King's Quest, but you will be able to assume the role of King Graham when he saves his children, Rosella and Alexander.
8279907	8281187	From a mysterious curse.
8281327	8283048	But they don't call it King's Quest.
8283108	8284588	It's just kind of one of those wink wink.
8285288	8285568	Yep.
8287769	8290329	But you know what the best thing about this whole thing is?
8291370	8291970	It's free.
8292310	8293030	I know.
8294570	8295831	And who here likes free?
8296331	8296931	Me.
8297671	8298731	Loki's hand is not up.
8298771	8299732	How is this possible?
8299952	8300612	Okay, he raised it.
8300832	8302092	And remember, Yaris doesn't count.
8303133	8304093	Yeah, Yaris doesn't count.
8304313	8305113	And it's episodic.
8306724	8307805	Please, please.
8308385	8318009	Even that little demo I played of Silver Lining back when the guy was on the show with the interview like four or five years ago, the little demo we played was better than Yaris by leaps and bounds.
8318129	8320611	So I'm sure the full game is plenty fine.
8321791	8323572	The art in the game is pretty gorgeous, too.
8325513	8325813	All right.
8326734	8327454	Loki, what you got for us?
8328844	8331565	Yes, there's some interesting stuff coming from Konami.
8331905	8337587	Mainly just talk about Metal Gear and how well it's going to do for them.
8338247	8342068	They expect that Metal Gear Solid, the Peace Walker, to sell 3 million copies.
8344668	8346589	Which is according to their expectations.
8347489	8353731	And predicting, I guess they're saying that... I wonder if they're talking about 3 million copies...
8356063	8357184	No, it must not be this month.
8357704	8358965	No way that it's going to sell that many.
8360166	8364688	They're also talking about Metal Gear Arcade, which we had heard a little bit about.
8366129	8370191	Obviously, it was delayed since it didn't come out in March as it was originally released.
8371672	8381558	The company, though, is putting some extra time on the title, which apparently... I think it's only coming out in arcades in Japan.
8381578	8381678	Japan.
8383683	8385624	But at least it's still on the way.
8387044	8387425	Kind of neat.
8388085	8394648	Man, it's a bummer all the arcades here have just turned into ticket spitters because some of these games sound sweet.
8395528	8395688	Yeah.
8397629	8403573	Alright, another bit of Konami related news has to do with Castlevania Harmony of Despair.
8403933	8407576	You might remember this was the Xbox Live title that was shown at E3.
8407616	8415461	It's kind of the Symphony of the Night style graphics, but now it's like a multiplayer and I talked about the Neo Geo effect where things like zoom in and out and all that fun stuff.
8415821	8426028	Well, it's kind of funny because I kind of got into some words on Twitter this week with somebody who's very anti-Microsoft and is kind of pissed off that Konami won't release this on PSN.
8426508	8426809	Well,
8427549	8428210	Hint, hint, hint.
8444341	8451891	But my thought is, okay, so how are the Sony fanboys who hate Microsoft supposed to get the Microsoft version of this to sell?
8453073	8454154	Does not compute.
8454595	8458260	And at the same time, why not just really, I mean, is the game that hard to port?
8458460	8459001	I don't get it.
8459061	8459521	What's the problem?
8461761	8476151	All these other arcade games come out for both all the time I don't know, that comment from Igarashi just kind of I mean, I hate to say it, but it sucks Like, there's something else there he's not saying Something about the business or something, I don't know
8479053	8490937	Maybe they think people in Japan aren't going to play this because it's on Xbox Live and they're really worried about how it's received and so they don't want to go to PlayStation Network because that's how everybody will buy it in Japan.
8491657	8492277	Could it be that?
8494218	8494558	I don't know.
8499119	8501060	Anyhow, I guess we'll never know.
8501120	8502360	We'll have to see how the game sells.
8502740	8508782	But on the bright side, PSN fans, it is part of that whole Summer of Arcade thing going on so, you know,
8510071	8511672	It probably will do pretty well.
8512632	8513033	Let's see.
8513593	8519336	DarkTetsuya says, My guess is it's Konami playing favorites or something similar to what happened in the SNES Genesis days.
8519976	8524779	It just seems so weird for companies nowadays to just come out and say, Well, we love this system best.
8525299	8531903	Even though that's kind of what happened at the Sony press conference when Gabe from Valve came out and said, The best version of Portal 2 will be on the PS3.
8533464	8534144	In so many words.
8535705	8536345	What?
8537946	8539467	Were you asleep last week?
8540276	8543137	Yeah, but the only reason they say... I know, it still boggles the mind.
8543197	8546058	But here's why they say it's the best version of Portal 2.
8546358	8547699	It's because it has Steam.
8547939	8549119	And he got paid a lot of money.
8549859	8550720	Yeah, that too.
8551080	8553741	And it was during the PlayStation press conference.
8554141	8554581	That'd be funny.
8554601	8556702	He's like, Fuck y'all, it's gonna be Xbox 360.
8556742	8558062	See ya.
8559723	8561383	No, but that's the only reason why.
8561423	8562384	It's because of Steam.
8564104	8568386	Steam is wonderful on PC, but I don't give a flying fuck about Steam on PlayStation 3, so...
8569372	8570272	I think it's interesting.
8570452	8577074	I think the news about the Steam cloud support is almost in a way more interesting than what was said about Portal.
8577194	8577734	Who cares?
8578314	8579035	Cloud support!
8579115	8580835	I can take my save game with me!
8581335	8584096	Do I really go play in other people's houses on the PlayStation 3s?
8584236	8584416	No.
8584616	8585976	Do I actually play in my PlayStation 3?
8586276	8586496	No.
8586777	8589597	So why do I even care about the stupid cloud support?
8589617	8590317	Some people do.
8590537	8592278	Could they work with the PC versions of the game?
8592318	8594679	Yeah, I go to Alan's house and back all the time.
8595059	8596279	I would benefit from that.
8596959	8600221	I used to go, you know, play games at my friend's house a while back.
8600261	8604304	You know, wouldn't this have been great when we were all doing our big Bimani swap?
8604664	8605145	Hell yeah.
8605885	8607506	We've got everyone's unlocks, yay!
8609848	8613510	You can just also easily copy a save onto a memory card.
8614771	8615772	Alright, let's move on.
8616432	8617553	Let's get to the mailbag!
8624252	8632098	Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of your emails and read them here on the show for you guys.
8632738	8634299	We want to read some of our favorites.
8634740	8639563	I'm taking you over for DarkSakura for one more week and she'll be back to reading next week.
8640284	8640944	Well, the week after.
8640964	8644867	Because as you can tell, my voice is a lot better, but it's not 100%.
8646570	8650293	That's alright, we got some quick emails tonight here, so we're just gonna get through these real quick.
8650573	8651113	Oh, look at this.
8651634	8663622	One of our very frequent emailers got his account hacked, because, hi, I would like to recommend you a very good company, and the website is blah blah blah blah blah, cell phones, LCDs, oh, you poor thing.
8663962	8665463	That's been happening a lot to people lately.
8665583	8666084	Isn't that weird?
8667785	8669466	Anyway, I bet you guys really care about that.
8669506	8670247	Watch your emails!
8671648	8675731	This email comes to us from TheShadowSniper, and it's not spam.
8676690	8682112	Just started playing Final Fantasy XIII a couple days ago and I'm about 9-10 hours in the game and there's nothing wrong with it.
8682592	8684193	Don't know why people are complaining about it.
8684333	8688274	I've been a gamer for over 10 years and I've seen much worse games than Final Fantasy XIII.
8688795	8693717	Yeah, I agree, it could have been better, but you can't really expect to have games tailored exactly to your needs.
8693837	8694097	Why?
8694457	8696938	Because every gamer will have a different view of any game.
8697558	8709224	Also, expecting a game to be absolutely amazing will only add to the disappointment when you realize it's not exactly what you wanted and it's not always about what we want because it's impossible to have games tailored exactly to what we want.
8709584	8710684	We can only hope for the best.
8711305	8714546	Again, too much hype and expecting too much will only add to the disappointment.
8714626	8715587	Sorry for the long read.
8715687	8717588	I could go on and on, but let's just leave it at that.
8717868	8718888	And you guys have a good night.
8718988	8720089	Thanks, TheShadowSniper.
8720589	8726775	Yeah, a lot of people were hating on Final Fantasy XIII, but you know, it did, it was really slow to build.
8726835	8732580	Like, I think, you know, and this game's been out a couple months now, but I realize, you know, with price drops and everything, folks get into it later on down the road.
8733361	8743831	It's kind of like, it's like a, I think I called it like a banana or a piece of fruit that peels back its layers very slowly to show all the, you know, different components of it.
8744355	8746696	Final Fantasy games usually take a little while to get going.
8746916	8748937	But XIII especially so.
8750057	8750657	Just saying.
8751978	8754639	I actually thought though Final Fantasy XIII had a lot in common with VII.
8754679	8757280	I mean VII was very linear in the beginning of the game too.
8757960	8760581	And nobody hated on that as much as they're hating on XIII.
8760621	8761841	Well, actually I take that back.
8761861	8764082	There's very vocal people that hate on VII quite a bit.
8764282	8765682	Nobody hated on it back then.
8765942	8767363	But yeah, they didn't hate on it.
8767543	8770244	Yeah, at the time it was revolutionary.
8772799	8773659	Let's go to another email.
8773679	8774599	We got two emails left.
8774639	8779380	This one is from... He does not really have a nickname, but he signed it Colby, so we'll go with that.
8779420	8781001	Colby, hello OLR crew.
8781781	8783741	I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice.
8783961	8786082	I'm visiting the Rockland Roseville area.
8786262	8787302	Oh, this is a local question.
8787682	8788762	To visit my friend Chris.
8789282	8790643	I wonder if he wanted this read on air.
8791043	8794824	Oh, well, the guy who worked at John's Incredible Pizza and recognized you guys a while back.
8794864	8795284	Remember that?
8795404	8795904	Yeah, I do.
8796024	8796644	Yeah, I remember that.
8796724	8797124	He was cool.
8797805	8800067	I was wondering if you guys could give me some ideas for things to do.
8800107	8804531	We've already been to the Golfland Arcade, San Francisco, including the Metreon in Japantown.
8804932	8806693	I'm so sorry you had to see the Metreon.
8807234	8808715	You should have seen the Metreon years ago.
8809096	8809857	And Cusar.
8810317	8814902	It seems like we have similar tastes and hobbies in general, so I figure there's no one better to ask than you guys.
8815495	8817697	Ooh, tough questions.
8818057	8818438	Stars?
8819879	8820700	Isn't that the name of the place?
8820740	8821781	The place in Vacaville?
8821961	8822842	I haven't been there in years.
8822862	8823623	No, not Vacaville.
8823643	8826405	I'm talking about the place, the bowling alley in Roseville.
8826585	8828607	Oh, yeah, the bowling alley out in Rockland, Roseville.
8828627	8830369	Yeah, Stars, I think.
8830589	8831490	I think that's the name of it.
8831918	8833799	Starz is in Vacaville.
8833839	8834720	Starz is the Vacaville.
8834740	8836401	There's one in Rockland, though.
8836581	8836982	Strikes.
8837222	8837802	That's it.
8837882	8838583	That's a good place.
8838743	8839483	They have a good arcade.
8839984	8842725	If you like the nerdy stuff, Dave & Buster's is now open in Roseville.
8843086	8844386	I hear it's not that great.
8844486	8846568	I haven't been there myself yet, but I hear it's kind of eh.
8847428	8851831	You've got to go to the Jelly Belly Factory out in Fairfield.
8852112	8855554	Anybody visiting NorCal has got to go to the Jelly Belly Factory and get them some belly flops.
8856154	8868161	If you're thinking about trekking back over to the Bay Area, if you didn't do the Tea Gardens, I know you said you went to Japantown, but if you didn't do the Japanese Tea Gardens, which are closer, I believe, to Golden Gate Park than Japantown is, you gotta check that out.
8868361	8868762	Beautiful.
8868842	8870262	And the pier.
8870282	8871803	Pier 39 is a great tourist trap.
8872104	8872744	Have the donuts.
8873937	8894462	Oh, and um In the bucket Get the donuts in the plastic bucket They're amazing If you haven't though If you haven't ever eaten at a Bubba Gump's And you really like seafood They're actually pretty good And they have a pomegranate margarita That is amazing If Riptide's still there on the pier No, they're not They got replaced by a sports bar It's been a while Yeah They got replaced by a sports bar There's a sports bar there now At least last time I was there
8895755	8899097	I was there like... We did a live broadcast from there when it was... Yeah.
8899177	8900217	Never mind.
8900277	8901358	It's back from B3.
8901598	8901798	Yep.
8903058	8907980	And that was when Megumi and I left to go to Japan town on the last day.
8908280	8909021	I don't know.
8909161	8916224	Colby didn't say where he was from, so I don't know what he gets in his neck of the woods, but it might be worth it, especially if you're coming during this time of year, drive up the other way.
8916264	8921726	Instead of going to the bay, drive up the hill and go to Tahoe because they've got some gambling if you're into that, but...
8921966	8922406	DarkSakura.com
8943383	8943843	Lots of good stuff.
8943863	8945283	Or Fort Bragg or something like that.
8945443	8947344	So that was a very local question.
8947484	8948824	I hope we gave you some good ideas.
8949744	8953905	It seemed like he mentioned a lot of nerdy things, so I was trying to make sure we got all the nerd spots out.
8953925	8954365	But I think we did.
8954385	8961427	But I do have to say, though, it is... And this is... Kristen and I, we went to Point Reyes and missed the lighthouse while it was open.
8961807	8967988	But we just sat out on this cliff face, looking out over the ocean, watching the mule deer play, and it was awesome.
8969028	8988240	If you have a couple days to play with, drive to Disneyland Alright, let's see, let's move on Ray Ayanami saying go to SVGL and play Technica They have that at Roseville Golf Land now, granted it's broken, but you know, still What isn't?
8989280	8993443	Let's see, moving on, let's go to this last email here
8995126	9000486	and this email is from is there a signature somewhere here?
9001560	9027154	Hey OLR, this is MC here, I've never called you guys up on Skype, rarely participated in chat, and certainly never sent an email your way before However, with this being your 8th anniversary and all, I figured it was time to finally jump in and say hello But more so to say thanks for the years of enjoyment you've brought to me and the countless others of the OL Army I first began tuning into OLR somewhere in 2003 Wow, this is this guy's first email
9027774	9028114	Wow.
9028134	9028675	That's awesome.
9028815	9029855	Well, thank you for writing us.
9030416	9032017	Yeah, I wish you'd done it sooner.
9032337	9032757	That's okay.
9033118	9037821	Hell, if I remember how I even found out about you guys, but I think someone mentioned it on a forum.
9038321	9039562	Maybe my DDR freak, Sig.
9039922	9040622	Hell, it could have been me.
9041363	9046026	I'd just gotten a PS2 and DDR Max 2 for a middle school graduation gift and fell in love.
9046506	9054752	None of my friends were especially interested in rhythm games, much less DDR, so OLR satiated my need for conversation on my favorite topic, music games.
9055592	9060496	I'd listen whenever possible and upon the advent of the to-go edition, I would download them overnight.
9060857	9062118	Thank you, dial-up connection.
9062458	9064019	And listen away during classes.
9064460	9068964	Perhaps this was detrimental to my grade a bit, but it didn't matter because I had more OLR.
9069524	9070185	That's really sweet.
9071786	9078392	Then came the day when it became official that OLR was no longer solely a music game show, but one for all video games.
9078893	9080034	And that's when I stopped listening.
9080054	9080434	No, I'm kidding.
9081936	9086941	Sure, other games had always come into the dialogue of the show, but my young self felt a little betrayed.
9087421	9087721	Oh, that's sweet.
9112182	9140574	you know what's funny though he really does have a point like if we wanted to be a music games only show or maybe like a website it would be really easy to do that in fact yeah I've thought about maybe we should take our website back in that direction have a little fun with it kind of like kind of like a site like DDR Freak Bomani style but you know with our eyes open to the fact that you know American audiences play other games too you know I mean maybe yeah but Bomani style kind of does that now they do they do to their credit they do
9141238	9143347	I've had thoughts on this before.
9143748	9145455	This is something we'll have to discuss offline.
9146354	9156162	I remember tuning in for episode 100 and thinking just how awesome it was that the show had lasted that long.
9156462	9159924	I don't think I ever expected it to still be around as I inched towards the age of 21.
9160925	9163747	Hell, who could have ever predicted it would get into episodes in the 300s?
9164187	9168751	It's beyond awesome that you all have the dedication to continue this show and I'm beyond thankful that it's been around.
9169211	9174095	I'm sure almost everyone, if not all, who listens regularly would reiterate this sentiment in a heartbeat.
9174555	9175556	We love you, OLR.
9175916	9176378	No homo.
9177641	9178083	Sorry, Rob.
9181636	9185058	There actually is an extra note for me.
9185338	9188539	I have a note for Rob in particular, so feel free to skip on reading this a bit.
9188739	9189600	Extra stage, Rob.
9189980	9190740	Should I read this anyway?
9191060	9193101	Go for it.
9193461	9198504	I wanted to personally thank you, not for OLR, but for being who you are.
9198984	9202185	Yes, that sounds awfully saccharine, but there's reason for me saying this.
9202245	9207508	Throughout high school, I never had any gay friends, and I didn't know anyone in my family who fell anywhere on the LGBT spectrum.
9207928	9209829	However, I sure as hell knew I was gay.
9210549	9210849	DarkSakura.com
9232950	9238495	happened with or without my listening to OLR, but you really helped me realize it was okay to be me.
9238996	9242679	So, Rob, I love you in a purely platonic gay bro sort of way.
9242979	9243700	Thanks for reading.
9244521	9245862	That's... That's awesome.
9245882	9246342	That's sweet.
9246562	9248164	That's very... You know...
9250054	9277142	earlier in the show I talked about some very unfortunate things that have happened because of OLR but for every bad thing that happens like that there's moments like that and just knowing that there is not just this one particular email but a whole community of people who I know really do support this show and everything we do here the good outweighs the bad
9278403	9281086	And in that case, the pure evil, honestly.
9283209	9284951	That was actually really awesome.
9285112	9286413	That was wonderful.
9286654	9288196	That was a great birthday present.
9288496	9292021	Seriously, guys, over eight years, you've touched more hearts and minds than you realize.
9292443	9293444	And we've touched parts.
9294845	9295665	And other parts.
9295745	9304351	It's a little weird to think about because I'm kind of like, well, you know, it's not like we're freaking, you know, Oprah or, you know, a huge show watched by millions.
9304411	9311136	But it's neat to think that despite the little group we have here has been so thankful.
9311216	9312556	And, you know, we really do feel that.
9312937	9313957	It really is the motivation.
9313977	9318200	Because I'll tell you what, I can't tell you how many times I've been like, and why am I doing this?
9318360	9322183	Why am I rushing home from San Francisco to do this show tonight again?
9322864	9326973	and then an email like that shows up and you're like, oh yeah, that's why.
9327369	9331432	Well, and we've all made a lot of good friends through the show, too.
9331552	9335194	I mean, Ranma's been slept in my futon.
9337836	9339837	And, you know, come all that way.
9340178	9343200	And, you know, and Misty's come and, you know.
9343720	9347162	And I've met hella people at just shows, which has been great.
9347242	9356589	Like, you know, just recently at PAX East, there were some people, Gold Anthro, I believe, was telling me, like, dude, because of your show, I started doing podcasting stuff.
9356629	9356989	And I'm like,
9358250	9359971	Is there a better compliment you can get?
9360051	9360531	Yes or no?
9360611	9361431	I mean, there really isn't.
9361592	9365314	I mean, that's just awesome.
9365834	9379662	Actually, one thing that I really want to owe to the show, if I may, is that it actually did a lot in dealing with a little personal self-esteem issue that I used to have where I would freak out if anyone said anything negative about me.
9380603	9383345	And I would always say, yeah, I don't care, I don't care.
9383405	9384806	But after actually getting hate mail...
9385826	9386527	I know, I laugh.
9387427	9391129	It's sort of like, really cemented it for me that these people don't know who I am, I don't care.
9392390	9399615	And then after that, getting so much more positive in return and having people go on other forums to smack people down.
9400335	9403257	And I'm just watching it going, that's so cool.
9405508	9406669	It's quite interesting.
9407090	9411293	I mean, and I'm not saying that I'm really the retaliatory type anymore.
9412834	9417018	But, I mean, just having people that'll just jump to your defense like that, too, is pretty cool.
9418959	9422302	Abochi Kawan Chat says, Everyone group hug.
9422642	9425425	Black Wolf says, I was inspired by OLR back in the day.
9425465	9426966	And that just, like, blows my fucking mind.
9427046	9428027	Because when I listen to Bobby...
9428827	9430828	I feel like he's been doing what he's done.
9431348	9436269	At least, I would think, just listening, he's been doing what he's been doing just as long as we've been doing our show.
9436849	9440730	So to hear that he was inspired by us is kind of strange to me.
9440750	9442590	Flaming Toilets' first show was the fuck show.
9446891	9450252	And keep in mind, everybody, there's going to be more to come.
9450768	9454250	And Flaming Toilet also says hate mail just means you've arrived.
9454470	9455191	I know.
9455211	9458333	Do you know how many times I tried to tell DarkSakura that when the hate mail was coming in?
9458353	9460674	I'm just like, that means you're popular.
9462003	9488933	Okay, well, the other thing, too, and now, because keep in mind, I had never actually ever gotten hate mail in my life for anything, so it was kind of a new thing for me, and I know that, like, actual real celebrities go through this, too, but the other thing, too, and this is actually going back in my big history buff, you know, interest, is that typically whenever a woman is outspoken or tries to, you know, run with the boys...
9490013	9512904	Right, that's exactly it Or, you know, whenever someone has an issue with a woman It's, you know, not maybe because of her political platform or this It's, oh, well, she's a woman, so she's PMSing Or something like that, you know what I mean You know Well, we originally brought Jamie on the show hoping she'd bring us pie But I'm just kidding Rob, you bitch
9514321	9515522	See, I'm the bitch on this show.
9516142	9517583	You're a sassy bitch.
9517883	9518524	That's right.
9518644	9519785	I'm a stupid bitch.
9520065	9521806	No, you're a sassy bitch.
9522146	9523107	Apparently, I'm the bitch.
9523127	9526509	I'm the one who actually did bring pie on several occasions.
9526529	9527730	I have brought pie, too.
9527870	9529311	No, I think we've all brought pie at some point.
9529331	9530612	I've brought pie, and I've brought cookies.
9530972	9533554	Ironically enough, Loki's probably the biggest... I have never brought pie.
9533954	9534875	But you brought bacon.
9535555	9536176	Super bacon.
9536236	9537957	Rob, I made you lobster kebabs.
9539858	9544222	I made you lobster kebabs with risotto so you can't say anything there.
9544502	9547985	There's our eight year anniversary moment looking back thanks to that email.
9548025	9551028	That was awesome.
9551328	9552609	Thank you.
9554451	9555852	I'll get choked up if I say anymore.
9555872	9558335	You're feeling verklempt.
9558455	9560016	Talk amongst yourselves.
9560216	9561397	I'm going to need a nephew.
9561417	9562278	I'll give you a topic.
9564355	9573046	I'm going to need an FUs of the Week segment to find the anger within me because right now I'm being taken over by big fluffy pink hearts and it's pretty disgusting.
9573487	9573747	Alright.
9589625	9593687	Well, I was gonna have a big nasty F you, but I'm all full of joy now.
9594408	9595808	My heart is singing.
9595929	9599611	It's a flutter with, like, unicorn farts.
9601792	9603533	OLR, powered by unicorn farts.
9605107	9614877	Um, I do want to say a big F you to the team that's been coming back in my hand, and also to, um, Aquin, who purchased my company.
9614937	9616159	I'm gonna go ahead and friggin' say it.
9616299	9617100	Aquin sucks.
9617900	9624107	They outsource all of their, um, customer service, and, um, yeah, they suck.
9625568	9627250	So, I don't care.
9629272	9632514	and another FU goes to Dust.
9632714	9634015	Lots and lots of Dust.
9635036	9636677	But... Anyone?
9637097	9637437	No?
9637878	9638318	Dust.
9638938	9639299	Anyone?
9639779	9640139	No?
9640760	9641140	Dust.
9641320	9643762	But I will have to give an anti-FU.
9644242	9644822	An anti-FU.
9644862	9645163	I see.
9646043	9652788	To finding... To actually having gone down a size, thanks to my raw foodism...
9653973	9654253	Yay!
9654293	9655054	Happy birthday!
9655074	9655174	Yay!
9682159	9687202	I totally forgot to get into tonight that when I arrived you weren't wearing pants, but that's a whole other story.
9687623	9689204	Oh yeah, I was wearing shorts.
9689384	9690084	I know, it was just funny.
9690124	9692166	I just walked in here, but they were kind of short shorts.
9692186	9693587	Now I'm like, are you wearing pants?
9694748	9699089	F you to jury duty and for wasting my time with a civil trial.
9723920	9724962	It's not going to be pretty.
9727486	9729389	I actually don't have a lot of FUs this week myself.
9729449	9730010	Are you done, Loki?
9730030	9730371	I'm sorry.
9730491	9730771	I'm done.
9731331	9733252	I'll have a lot of FUs the week myself.
9733292	9734133	Things have been pretty good.
9734173	9735293	Like, you know, it's been my birthday.
9735333	9735633	Shit.
9735673	9736734	Like, how can I be in a bad mood?
9736814	9738675	I saw a lot of awesome people this weekend.
9738715	9740216	There was a great charity show last night.
9741157	9743558	I had a lot to drink and then got up on stage with a microphone.
9743598	9744138	It was awesome.
9745599	9747500	But... What?
9747540	9747820	What's that?
9748100	9748801	Sorry.
9748881	9751843	DarkTezia says at least it's better than the time she had to hide her bras.
9752083	9754464	For the record, my bras are hanging up in the bathroom.
9754624	9758666	I was just in the restroom during the break, but I was gonna be nice and not bring that up this week.
9760217	9760858	I don't care.
9762839	9763560	I really don't care.
9763580	9766242	Well, remember you guys, you can't put a bra in the dryer.
9766382	9767222	It warps.
9769384	9770385	We do all the time.
9770665	9771626	The more you know.
9774283	9780647	Seriously, word of advice ladies, spend the money on a good bra and get a bra bag, wash it gentle and hang it.
9780687	9781188	No, trust me.
9781688	9782028	Trust me.
9782769	9787872	I have saved myself at least 60 bucks a year in buying bras.
9787892	9794235	This is what you need to do when the current job fades out and you need to become a spokesperson for the bra bag.
9796138	9797018	Rob, do you know where I get mine?
9797178	9799539	Hi guys, DarkSakura here for the bra bag.
9799739	9802861	I buy my lingerie bags at the dollar store, three for a buck, so don't worry about it.
9803701	9805142	Maybe I should do a frugal cast.
9805942	9806902	Alright, you should.
9807282	9808263	Go back with your FUs, I'm sorry.
9808283	9809283	Alright, I'm sorry, FUs.
9809983	9813345	Okay, actually I'm in a pretty good mood, but my one FU is that I've been...
9814125	9835056	I had this weird thing going on a couple weeks ago that was giving me side pain and I thought I was over it but like once in a while my side will still go boop I hate you boop I hate you and it kind of sucks to have that happen on your birthday but I think it's getting better for the most part but just F you to phantom medical issues all right uh oh we can't forget uh intern Junami Junami do you have any FUs
9835600	9836701	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
9865621	9866301	Drunk Chicks.
9866782	9867302	On the internet.
9867382	9868062	On the internet.
9868102	9868702	They exist.
9868742	9869223	Are bad.
9869503	9870583	And they're bad players.
9872504	9873044	Who to thunk.
9874465	9885049	These kids today, Loki, like they just... We don't care that you... Like back in my day, Drunk Chicks... Like I'm even gay and I thought that was awesome when Drunk Chicks would come on Xbox.
9885530	9888211	We don't care that you spent your Saturday nights partying.
9888451	9889071	We don't care.
9889191	9892293	Back in my day, I'd be happy if any chick came on.
9895592	9897453	Alright, no, I know what you're talking about.
9897873	9898553	It is annoying.
9899473	9900874	Alright, let's move on.
9901794	9904395	Loki, we have just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
9905135	9909156	We might have to put a time limit on Skype calls tonight, just so you know, because I know a lot of people want to call in.
9909576	9914817	So I think we're going to put a three-minute lock on the calls tonight so that we can try and burn through some calls.
9914938	9920679	So we're going to quickly, quickly do calls tonight because I know a few people want to call in because of the anniversary show.
9920719	9922140	So a three-minute cap on calls tonight.
9922560	9922820	Loki...
9924401	9925662	Yes, this is kind of neat.
9926282	9929965	You Don't Know Jack is coming back.
9931367	9940434	Apparently, this was revealed on the Giant Bomb podcast and confirmed on the official Jellyvision site.
9941175	9943878	They are partnering up with THQ to bring the series back.
9944138	9947562	Now, more details, I guess, are expected later this year.
9948363	9956552	And they haven't figured out if it's going to be a new game or just a new way to play the old games like on Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network.
9957253	9958995	But it's coming back.
9960176	9960917	That's pretty cool.
9961677	9963318	And we're all going to get screwed.
9963558	9966919	Did you say the name of the podcast that announced that was the Giant Bomb podcast?
9967119	9967339	Yes.
9967519	9971360	Yeah, we have the theme song, I believe, of the Giant Bomb podcast over here.
9971480	9972441	Let's tune in here.
9972461	9984165	If I remember correctly, I believe Giant Bomb is run by Jeff Gerstmann.
9985565	9986425	Do you remember him?
9987506	9988066	Little, uh...
9989500	9992061	Jack the Ride was one that was out and yeah
10019140	10020661	I remember the short-lived game show.
10022742	10025143	Oh yeah, the one that was like Pee Wee Herman hosted, right?
10026884	10029085	I watched a show today.
10029445	10030686	It's some weird game show.
10030706	10032387	This is while I was eating chicken wings.
10033927	10042632	They had a show where apparently it's filmed in LA on a rooftop and they drop things off of a roof while answering trivia questions.
10042672	10045793	I'm going to out myself as a hella nerd here on the show.
10045853	10047414	I saw the commercial for that and I'm a little retarded.
10047614	10066717	but I actually subscribe one of my things I read is a game show blog thing that has all the news on game shows like foreign game show clips and stuff and I was reading about that game sounded kind of dumb though it does sound dumb but you know for people like me who think you know those trivia game shows are kind of dumb it is fun watching things fall off a roof
10066857	10069118	I heard they pushed Grandma off the roof in one episode.
10069178	10070398	No, actually, it's kind of cool.
10070418	10073059	They have people that, you know... Downfall, says Flaming Toilet.
10073080	10073640	Yes, Downfall.
10074120	10076481	They do have people that come with them or whatever.
10076521	10078802	Like, in this case, it was a woman and her husband.
10079142	10085064	And at one point, the husband does get on the conveyor belt because there's a giant conveyor belt that rolls off the roof.
10085524	10089186	So if she didn't answer the questions in time, he would fall off the roof.
10091061	10093163	with a safety harness, unfortunately.
10093183	10095465	Sweet, I want to go on that show and put Jamie on the conveyor belt.
10095485	10096126	That'd be awesome.
10097607	10098808	Yeah, let me think of this question.
10098828	10101871	Oh, God, I just, I don't know.
10101911	10102992	What is two plus two?
10103032	10104233	That's really hard, you guys.
10104693	10105494	It's math.
10105834	10107956	Oh, Jamie just fell.
10107996	10108517	That sucks.
10108677	10109217	Five?
10109698	10109958	No?
10111079	10112700	Ah, damn it.
10114762	10116263	Take bets on how many times she bounces.
10116283	10121844	Jamie, this is the worst radio ever, but Jamie is giving me the biggest side eye right now.
10123645	10127506	That's called the absolute death stare, and it makes Dan piss himself.
10129867	10132548	Speaking of Dan, he just texted me and says mini-doc.
10133869	10135809	He's somewhere where there's a mini-derby owners club.
10135989	10137770	I think he's at Dave & Buster's.
10138562	10139403	Oh wow, interesting.
10140483	10140823	Alright.
10141444	10143345	Is that where you ride miniature horses?
10145426	10146046	Dwarf ponies.
10146066	10146446	Mini ponies.
10146806	10147427	Dwarf ponies.
10149108	10150128	You know what they need to make?
10151189	10152910	Do we have Sega employees that listen?
10153250	10153870	Hey, Sega!
10154130	10154450	Sega!
10154951	10155191	Sega!
10155811	10156952	Listen up, okay?
10157112	10160976	There's this game you made a while back called Derby Owners Club, okay?
10161536	10162317	And it's awesome.
10162918	10165100	And, you know, more arcades need to embrace it.
10165200	10168043	And, you know, to some extent maybe it should have been out on the home consoles.
10168083	10169984	At least it's an arcade title, if nothing else.
10170865	10178591	But what I really think would be awesome, Sega, is if you made Derby Owners Club again, but this time it's unicorns.
10179351	10181413	Like... Like for the special breeds?
10181613	10183054	Yeah, no, just all the breeds.
10183154	10184475	It's Unicorn Owners Club.
10184495	10186757	No, I think it should be a special breed.
10187657	10189439	I just, I'm just, just, just think about it.
10189559	10192441	Like, you know, the special ones, like some could shit rainbows.
10193121	10196343	Some of them could, you know, like, you know, have sparkle horns.
10196743	10198745	Some of them could barf love.
10200526	10201186	And live in harmony.
10201206	10202367	I was thinking fart glitter.
10202707	10207250	I think that they should have a derby owners club that's not necessarily limited to horses.
10207810	10216176	They could have hobos, you know, RC cars, you know, hobos.
10219196	10226842	Anthropomorphic, you know, plants, I don't know, just ridiculous stuff.
10227662	10228062	Awesome.
10228903	10232486	I'm surprised nobody's tried to make that game, the bumfights the game.
10232726	10234587	I'm really surprised it's never happened.
10235167	10236328	Although I don't want Sega to make that.
10236388	10241412	No, Sega, Sega, you need to make Unicorn Owners Club, that's all I'm saying.
10242693	10244014	What are you doing over there?
10244560	10250664	I was trying to find my friend's webcomic by googling Hobo Jesus, and instead I found this picture.
10252085	10253225	I'm linking this in the chatroom.
10254506	10259989	Speaking of Sega, ironically enough, we do have a Sega story, and this is our last story of the night, and it's kind of funny.
10260790	10265593	They have announced a new feature for Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown.
10265753	10267594	And I'm like, wow, Virtua Fighter's still around.
10268455	10271937	But it's coming out in the arcade, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown will be out in the
10272597	10273178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10291932	10294094	DK Lau has earned the Dragon Wing item from a basic capsule rare.
10315489	10316089	You know what I'd like?
10316329	10319211	I'd like them to add the feature to make people care about that.
10320131	10320912	I know.
10321812	10322973	I'm not that excited.
10324954	10327635	I'm not that excited about extra Twitter spam, to be honest.
10327655	10328335	I'm sorry to say.
10328675	10330036	So there you go.
10331539	10332460	I don't like that trend
10362998	10367322	Yeah, and Frisbee in chat actually says, do people hate game updates on Facebook?
10367362	10368302	How is this any different?
10368443	10371625	So, yeah, I mean, it's just Twitter spam, honestly.
10371645	10373547	They're trying to make their game a trending topic.
10374067	10377790	Flaming Toilet says, really, linking things to Twitter and Facebook isn't a big deal.
10377870	10380492	Taking a dump is now linked to Twitter and Facebook.
10380993	10383274	Wow, wouldn't that be great if your toilet sent tweets?
10383915	10387058	Like, been on can for 10 minutes.
10387078	10388659	Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Twitter shitter.
10391129	10391550	No, no, no.
10391570	10393773	Oh, someone liked my status and I'm playing a game.
10393834	10394214	How is that?
10394314	10394795	I don't know.
10394855	10395997	I'm still playing a game.
10398822	10400965	Alright, shall we open up the phones and take some calls?
10401045	10401827	I think we shall.
10401907	10402428	Oh my god.
10403223	10404904	The phone lines are open.
10423482	10426285	Whatever you want to do, give us a call and we will talk.
10426866	10430009	In the meantime, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?
10431430	10432792	Never mind, we have a call coming in.
10432992	10433192	No.
10434313	10435395	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10435435	10435835	Who's this?
10436556	10437697	Hey, hey, hey, hey, fellas.
10437797	10441001	It's DJ Ranma S. Hey, hey, hey.
10441041	10442662	Don't forget there's one non-fella here.
10443803	10444724	Hi, Ook-chan.
10445953	10447494	Hi Ranchan!
10447934	10448715	How are you doing, Ranma?
10449755	10450636	I'm doing good.
10451437	10464925	The point of this call is that right before you announced the 8th anniversary show, I sent a text to my entire staff trying to get them all on Twitter so we can shout and congratulate you guys for 8 awesome years.
10465405	10466186	Oh, well thank you.
10466446	10466946	Did it work?
10468908	10472830	I have with me my awesome Super Producer Sailor Flare with me.
10473571	10473871	Hi!
10474131	10474751	Hi Super Producer!
10474791	10474892	Hello!
10476613	10477653	Hi, nice to meet all of you.
10477753	10478833	Hi, nice to meet you.
10479374	10481874	So you actually work with DJ Ranma S?
10482594	10483034	Here we go.
10483314	10483534	Yes.
10483774	10484915	I am so sorry.
10487275	10488856	Don't you find him difficult?
10488936	10492316	Not as sorry as I am.
10492776	10493917	We think he's awesome.
10493957	10497937	He's the best New York City guy next to all the other OLR listeners out there.
10498077	10498277	All right.
10499518	10500138	I'm just messing.
10500158	10501898	Well, thank you guys for calling in.
10501918	10503138	That's very cool of you.
10503158	10505699	You guys are still doing your thing over there at the Anime Jam, right?
10506448	10507429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10521428	10521808	E3 on an anime show.
10544051	10544671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10566741	10572884	One of our hosts, DJ Synthetic, she's not just an anime fan, but she's our resident gamer girl.
10572924	10575586	So she handles all the video games and everything for us.
10576006	10580969	And believe you me, she fangirled more about E3 than all of us put together.
10581409	10582409	Well, I will say this.
10582930	10586151	I did check out when I was at Microsoft's booth.
10586631	10589793	I did look over and I saw a new Naruto game was being demoed.
10589833	10591574	And it definitely made me think you anime fans.
10592918	10603484	Yeah, when the Naruto games started coming stateside, a lot of people got happy about it, and some kind of complained because the Japanese voices were eliminated, but give and take.
10603504	10605526	I call it Fox Boy Ball Z.
10606687	10608227	Alright, time's about up, Ranma.
10608347	10609428	I gotta let you guys go.
10609688	10610648	Wait, wait, wait.
10610748	10611148	One last thing.
10611208	10611688	One last thing.
10613109	10616169	Ranchan, I thought of you earlier today when I was cleaning out the closet.
10617870	10619770	I found my Tamari fan.
10620690	10621791	Awesome.
10621931	10624511	And I found, actually, I just found the rest of my costume.
10625231	10626192	Cool.
10626352	10626972	My time jump.
10627652	10632173	Ranma, we want to hear from your co-host a little more and the chat room is asking, your plug is working.
10632233	10636154	The chat room wants to know how can they hear to Anime Jam Session?
10638353	10639534	It's all you, Sailor Flare.
10640715	10641316	Oh, God.
10642777	10644699	I think you do this all the time on the show.
10644719	10647061	I think you should rattle off the list.
10647121	10648723	I will do the short version.
10649223	10650865	Oh, God, there's a short version?
10651005	10656610	Yeah, just go to AnimeJamSession.com or just follow us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash AnimeJamSession.
10656963	10659084	Alright, plug successfully given.
10659225	10659865	Alright, there you go.
10659885	10664968	And also, you guys have something special we threw to you guys on your main page on OLR.com.
10665148	10666649	An awesome Beatmania sketch.
10666930	10668251	You may want to check it out after the show.
10668531	10669431	I saw that.
10669511	10674194	I haven't had a chance to watch it because I've been tied to my phone all weekend, but I'm going to watch it when I get home.
10674515	10674795	Alright.
10675856	10676136	Awesome.
10676156	10678017	Thank you guys for calling in and good luck with your show, okay?
10678417	10678757	Thank you.
10679678	10680158	Bye.
10680859	10683621	I did really crappy with the three minute time limit on that call.
10683641	10683921	Alright.
10684861	10685221	But that's okay.
10685802	10686963	Well, technically it was two people.
10687543	10690165	So we'll let it slide.
10690305	10691766	I should have given him six, but that's okay.
10691786	10692286	We gave him four.
10692727	10693007	All right.
10693027	10698271	1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
10699752	10700592	Loki, got something?
10700612	10701213	We'll wait for a call.
10701773	10715884	Yes, Zombrek's Dead Rising Sun, the film created by, actually, the creator of Dead Rising, the game, made its directorial debut.
10716244	10727012	It will actually be coming to North America and Europe this summer and will be released online, possibly as part of the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live.
10728577	10730345	We got another call on the line, so let me go to it.
10730385	10731510	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10731530	10731892	Who's this?
10732625	10733565	Hey, this is X-Link.
10733625	10734486	Well, hi, X-Link.
10734506	10735026	How are you?
10735166	10735406	Hey.
10736007	10737647	Happy birthday, bladed princess.
10738468	10739808	For me or the show or both?
10740349	10740649	Both.
10740889	10741229	All right.
10741489	10742089	Well, thank you.
10742369	10743450	We appreciate it.
10743510	10746351	Yeah, the guild on WoW calls me princess because I make them.
10746832	10747072	All right.
10747092	10750433	Well, we don't want to – No, I did it just to make you happy.
10750793	10752974	I'm sorry, but your princess is in another castle.
10753415	10754215	Pretty much.
10755075	10757096	Look, I don't want to take too much of the three minutes.
10757116	10758477	What do you want to talk about tonight, X-Link?
10758991	10760232	I want to talk about the real ID.
10761053	10763095	Oh, please, please.
10763355	10768960	I know you feel... At least I know I kind of helped make you... I'm pissed because you're not my real ID friend.
10769000	10769861	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
10769881	10771662	I actually have good news for you.
10772063	10774124	I know one of your gripes was because you couldn't change your name.
10774264	10782432	Actually, you could, and actually some of the people from Blizz went on some of the forums to let people know, yes, you can change your name, but you would have to call up
10782972	10790174	Unfortunately, to the 800 number and talk to one of the representatives and have them change it for you because you can't do it manually through their website.
10790694	10797416	But if you explain to them why, which I'm sure in good terms says you have a show, they will be more than happy to change it over for you.
10798076	10799997	So you can't get a change.
10800017	10801017	That doesn't sound too bad.
10801577	10806041	Yeah, I mean, except for the part of waiting on hold for 30 minutes when I call Blizzard.
10806061	10807462	Yeah, that would be the downfall.
10807522	10818970	But at the same time, too, though, they were telling people and people know, hey, look, you can get changed if you need change or if you got married and it's a different name altogether or you want it, you know, but you can't have it something.
10819070	10824614	I don't think if you want to say, I am an awesome god or, you know, I'm super badass 242.
10826036	10834586	I'm totally going to call in and tell them I got gay married and I want to change my last name to Roberts and I'll be Rob Roberts.
10834906	10836428	I'm totally going to do it.
10843544	10843945	You can do it.
10844065	10844706	And explain to them.
10844766	10846228	Say, hey, look, I have a podcast.
10846268	10848791	And I want to be my pen name instead.
10848872	10850013	And this is my pen name.
10850113	10851195	And I'm sure they'll allow you.
10851355	10854019	There shouldn't be a reason to as to why they want it.
10854119	10856202	That is actually really fast.
10857043	10857724	It's interesting.
10857924	10858465	I still...
10859326	10866552	Feel strongly that Blizzard is doing the wrong thing overall because this is a huge hurdle that we're having to go over to get the name fixed.
10867032	10868954	But that's a really interesting development.
10869314	10870916	I think they took things a little too quickly.
10871656	10872917	That was my personal issue.
10873017	10877481	I think they took things a little too quickly and they didn't get a lot of feedback and they just put it out there.
10877501	10878502	They're like, here you go.
10878662	10879523	It's all out here.
10879983	10880604	Have fun.
10881124	10885828	and a lot of people, like I said before, I know on our guild forum, I love the story.
10886748	10890071	Somebody was cyberstalked, believe it or not, kind of, in a way, in a way.
10890231	10900439	It was kind of like done as a prank from another guild member, but it showed that these, like with your story, this type of stuff can actually happen to other people in real life.
10900939	10903081	And you don't have to be Britney Spears.
10903181	10910789	Google, put out Google and figure out where they work, where they live, what their phone number is, possibly what their cell number is.
10911930	10915494	Yeah, so it can be a very scary thing if not used properly.
10916134	10916555	Interesting.
10917636	10918537	I'm going to think about it.
10918617	10919418	I might try that.
10920169	10923050	And the friend of the friend thing too, it was really peeved.
10923130	10924591	I don't believe that should be on there at all.
10924731	10927132	I don't believe the friend of the friend should be looked at.
10927272	10930253	And I believe that should have been ticked off, and that was the only thing that really upset me.
10930353	10933914	But other than that, I've been having a lot of fun with it with some of the other guild people.
10934075	10937776	I gotta wrap up, X-Link, but I do want to say I'm gonna thank you for the tip.
10937936	10941257	I'm going to look into that, but I'm still gonna fight them to make it right.
10941397	10943558	I'm still gonna put up a good fight to make it right for everybody.
10943838	10944979	Definitely, just don't leave us.
10945799	10967626	I won't, alright Take care, excellent, bye No homo, bye Alright, 877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you want to give us a call And talk to us here 877-GAME-OLR, Orange Lounge Radio We got another call coming in already Let's pick it up and see who it is Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10968887	10973068	Hi, this is Spaznina Hi Spaznina, you sound kind of different tonight Are you on a new phone?
10974638	10996476	Yeah, I just switched from cell phone to traditional landline You actually sound a lot clearer, we like it Well, we're on a time limit tonight and I know you've been trying to get through for a little bit So quickly, tell us what's on your mind Condensed story, I have to take so many tasks yet again You know how I got the yellow light of death not too long ago on my Playstation 3?
10996676	10997576	I do, and then you were...
10999498	10999958	Guess what?
11000058	11002019	It happened again, not even two months later.
11002440	11003380	Shut up.
11005961	11007682	Is this a Slim or a regular PS3?
11008963	11010223	A regular PlayStation 3.
11010984	11011484	Wow.
11011504	11015106	You know, specifically the 40 gigabyte model.
11016006	11021229	And, you know, I can understand that, you know, systems fail occasionally.
11021769	11025611	But A, I just got the system repaired not even two months ago.
11026463	11029606	and they sent me a refurbished system.
11030046	11034990	You would think they would have checked the system over before they sent me a system.
11035631	11052424	So basically, luckily, my one favorite grace is they gave me a three month warranty on the repair so I don't have to shell out the $150 for the repair but it's still a major pain that you know what.
11053205	11055847	It's quite likely and once I get the system back
11064417	11067519	They gotta have your picture on the wall over there, Spazinator.
11067859	11069260	After all this that you've been through.
11069680	11070740	You know what you need to do?
11071021	11072901	Is you need to go on the second season of The Tester.
11076335	11077735	Yeah, I should.
11079736	11080376	That's my answer.
11081196	11086898	That should be your pitch is that I need to go on the tester because I have seen everything broken at Sony.
11090158	11091439	That really should be it.
11092659	11094379	Yeah, really.
11095199	11104542	Well, I'll try to keep everyone posted as to what's going on with the system either through Twitter or whatever.
11105042	11105742	Please do.
11108123	11117772	I know you guys are not going to have a show next week, but hopefully there will be some news out for the following show in two weeks.
11119273	11120294	Please let us know.
11120795	11123177	At any rate, happy 8th anniversary.
11126465	11127906	Well, thank you very much, Spazinator.
11127986	11135949	I know you haven't listened for the whole eight years, but I know you definitely have had your voice heard on this program over at least about, what, a year and a half, two years?
11136429	11144332	Yeah, I've been calling for about two years, but I haven't been listening since 2006, give or take.
11144812	11145653	We've enjoyed having you.
11146033	11153416	All right, well, Spazinator, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but good luck with the Sony mess, and I'm telling you, Tester, season two, and give OLR a shout-out when you get on.
11154887	11155528	Sure.
11155588	11157309	Have a good one.
11174471	11176972	And you've been an inter- Dude, Drew Nami.
11177652	11179693	There's this show on PlayStation Network.
11179833	11182354	Oh, shit.
11182895	11184415	I will help you shoot your audition video.
11185356	11186336	Come on, Drew.
11186676	11188197	I don't even own a PS3.
11190078	11190758	All the more reason.
11190818	11191538	All the more reason.
11191658	11193099	PlayStation Network what?
11195900	11196520	Exactly.
11196600	11197801	You get to test stuff.
11197841	11199222	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11199282	11199802	Who's this?
11201240	11203862	Hi, this is Gold Anthro.
11203922	11207044	I'm doing pretty good.
11207544	11216510	I've started listening to OLR again because I'm done with my high school and I'm kind of enjoying the summer now since I'm OLR with my friends.
11219858	11220398	Yes, I did.
11220438	11222859	Me and my friend Robocon in chat.
11222879	11223380	You say two friends.
11223440	11224300	I've done a lot of that.
11224320	11226201	Congratulations on your 8th birthday.
11226261	11227461	I'm proud to see it's your birthday.
11245589	11246249	Thank you very much.
11246369	11248330	I think you were listening.
11248370	11257473	I did tell listeners a little bit ago we met up at PAX East and I do remember what you said about that we inspired you to do your own thing and that I can think of no better compliment.
11257513	11266216	So amongst all the cray-crays that are out there in the world, it's nice that there's cool people, a lot more cool people that are into what we do here at OLR.
11267596	11268816	Yeah, it's nice.
11268877	11273458	I was glad to hear that you remembered that because I know there's a lot of people you meet up with and
11273834	11276637	So I really appreciate that when I heard that again today.
11276897	11278158	It's not as many as you'd think.
11278278	11279980	We're not, you know, I'm not Oprah.
11281642	11282383	And thank God.
11282523	11286647	I know you guys are with, like, you know, the All Games group.
11286687	11289610	I know there's a lot of people, a lot of listeners, and so I don't know.
11290792	11291513	It seems like a lot.
11291553	11292013	It's all good.
11292073	11292534	It's all good.
11293895	11297859	We have fun here at All Games Radio holding down the Sunday nights with our buddy Bobby.
11297919	11298759	The more the merrier.
11299100	11300321	Yeah.
11300581	11302363	There's a lot of other great All Games shows though too.
11302423	11310050	I hear the girls at TQ Crush gave me a birthday shout out but I didn't hear it and I looked at their podcast feed and I didn't see anything there and I don't know.
11310610	11310770	So...
11311531	11314614	Yeah, I honestly love all games.
11314694	11315515	It's pretty cool.
11315595	11316636	It's a great little network.
11317316	11320920	Loki, are you going to be out when the baby's born for a little bit?
11321360	11323442	I couldn't remember if we had talked about that or not.
11323722	11324663	Probably a couple weeks.
11324703	11325564	Probably a couple weeks.
11325664	11336895	We might, I don't know, we have to talk about a contingency plan, but one idea I have is that we might actually reach out to some of the other all games hosts, or just in general, just podcast, indie podcast hosts, to kind of help out.
11337783	11339044	That sounds cool.
11339084	11340145	Temporarily promote the intern?
11340165	11340405	Wait, who?
11340425	11340745	Your dog?
11340765	11341005	Oh, cat.
11358949	11360130	Oh, well, hi, Kitty.
11360350	11360710	Hi, Kitty.
11360871	11362492	Oh, you named him after Macintosh?
11362512	11362912	That's awesome.
11362932	11363953	That's so cute.
11363973	11364933	That's cute.
11364973	11366775	My cat's named after a video game character.
11366835	11368276	I know you guys are going to get going, though.
11368416	11369156	You guys are going to get going.
11369176	11370137	There's other people that want to call in.
11370197	11373439	Was there anything else you wanted to say or any quick games you've been playing or shout-outs you want to give?
11375721	11376662	No, that's pretty much it.
11376782	11381225	I just wanted to let you talk to you guys and check in with you and congratulate you.
11381265	11384347	You guys have a nice night, and let's enjoy the rest of the podcast.
11384447	11384587	Bye.
11385328	11386108	Thank you so much.
11386148	11386669	You take care.
11388422	11390563	Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, have Travis do it.
11390663	11391564	No, wait, bad idea.
11391984	11395226	Travis is still trying to get us to do that whole sitting on the toilet thing.
11395266	11400649	And I'm just like, where do I go with this?
11400709	11401789	Like, I don't know.
11401829	11407292	It's kind of one of those like, I just don't think I really want to put that on myself on the internet.
11407312	11411294	I'm trying to think of how to do it funny, you know, but I don't know.
11411977	11412618	Have Drew do it.
11412678	11413840	He'll turn it into a train wreck.
11413960	11414661	Here's the problem.
11415302	11418347	E3 week is really not the best week to be starting stuff.
11421106	11425230	I think they threw down a contest and had the deadline on my birthday.
11425971	11431436	And it's kind of one of those... Okay, I'm all for having fun with USL.
11431977	11434139	Perfect Dark Knight was awesome.
11434179	11435580	I really want to do that again.
11436141	11437843	Sitting on the toilet video making?
11438323	11439304	Less awesome.
11440345	11442167	Let's go back to what counts.
11442187	11442767	Draw the line here.
11443629	11447380	I know he called me out on YouTube because he loves me.
11447560	11449345	Alright, let's go to more calls.
11449666	11451070	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
11451110	11451511	Who's this?
11452975	11453675	This is Ziba.
11454336	11455136	Well, hi, Ziba.
11455196	11455776	How are you?
11455936	11456336	Hi.
11456957	11457897	I'm doing great.
11458037	11458437	Hey.
11458457	11461878	Well, you guys were talking about pinball before.
11462138	11462379	Yep.
11462499	11466320	And it totally reminded me of a place I went to recently called the Silver Ball.
11466760	11467460	The Silver Ball?
11467480	11474223	It's a museum and an arcade, and it's this huge, huge, like, arcade room, like an arcade on, like, a boardwalk.
11475107	11479689	It's like wall-to-wall pinballs from the 1930s to 1999.
11480169	11480809	Where is this?
11480869	11482910	Jamie needs to be put on a plane immediately.
11483610	11485390	It's in Asbury Park, New Jersey.
11486131	11486951	I have heard of this.
11488011	11488751	I have heard of this.
11488891	11492452	Is that in North Jersey, South Jersey, Middle Jersey?
11493593	11496014	Middle Jersey, Central Jersey, near the shore.
11496834	11498554	I've probably driven right by there.
11499555	11503696	Is that by Red Bank or where the Jay and Silent Bob store is?
11505262	11505662	Maybe.
11505843	11506943	It's near the Stone Pony.
11507504	11507784	Okay.
11507884	11508805	You know the Stone Pony?
11508905	11515270	Well, keep in mind, I live on the total opposite coast, so I'm not so up on my Jersey geography, but I'm just trying to think if I've been close.
11515310	11515930	All right, well, anyway.
11516271	11517291	I totally want to go.
11517432	11519653	I've been to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.
11519673	11521715	Of course, that would involve going to Jersey.
11522515	11525218	I'm just kidding.
11525338	11527099	Small sacrifice.
11527179	11530582	I took my dad there for Father's Day, and he enjoyed it.
11530742	11532283	Oh, my God, you should have saw his face.
11532443	11533344	He found this once.
11533789	11535891	DarkSakura, you're gonna just have to come in the luggage
11561826	11565350	Let's start a fund right now, the Send DarkSakura to the East Coast Fund.
11566311	11569514	I'm going to open up my PayPal account so everyone can put in their pennies.
11571176	11571436	Alright.
11571697	11573198	You guys know she's never going to come back.
11574139	11579485	The thing is, you have to pay an admission fee and all the tumble machines are free.
11580226	11581467	Oh, that sounds like fun.
11581687	11582588	How much is the admission fee?
11582608	11583870	Is it probably like 10 bucks or so?
11585419	11612485	I think it's $7.50 for a half hour and then it goes up from there and here's the website I'll post it into the chat it probably has the cost and everything they are going to appreciate this fat plug you're about to give there silverballmuseum.com thank you Ziba YYR is going crazy I've definitely the daily pass would be perfect for me
11615084	11622370	I would be in there all day It's crazy Oh my god I was so overwhelmed when I went in there Okay, okay
11634962	11635762	No, not really.
11635942	11639884	My dad was a big pinball machine person, so I brought him there.
11640724	11644846	I'm not really a pinball machine person, but it was really, really cool.
11645006	11650908	If your dad has any of the consoles, check out the Williams Pinball Collection.
11651048	11652808	It's very worthy, and it's worth looking at.
11652868	11654109	It's probably only $20 right now.
11654429	11655069	It's great.
11655169	11655969	This is fantastic.
11655989	11658750	My dad's not really tech-savvy, so I don't think he would.
11659090	11659591	Oh, bummer.
11659691	11660591	Oh, well, it was worth a shot.
11661511	11666413	I'm looking at what's on the list, by the way, through here, and there are some actually amazing.
11666673	11668674	Do the Galaga Pinball.
11669394	11669694	All right.
11670795	11672676	Ziba, I think you made Jamie's day.
11672976	11675377	I think you've given Jamie a new mission in life.
11676397	11682639	Jamie and Rob Roberts are going to hit the road in a Blues Brothers-style comedy to go to Ashbury Park, New Jersey.
11683020	11683280	All right.
11683940	11686041	And for the record, if you ever go, let me know.
11686181	11686501	I'll come.
11687429	11688029	Absolutely.
11688370	11695034	And for the record, I'm looking at the later ones, and there's at least four of them on there that are in my house.
11696674	11700217	Ziba, we've got to let you get more calls, but thank you so much for the tip.
11700377	11701117	We appreciate it.
11701437	11703058	I think you've got a bunch of listeners interested.
11703098	11704759	The Silver Ball Museum, I'm sure, thanks you.
11704839	11707601	And on top of that, another straight No Chaser fan.
11709042	11709322	All right.
11710733	11713356	Ziba's currently on my upper list right now.
11714216	11720483	Ziba has ascended into the... Between pinball and being a straight no chaser fan, totally.
11722412	11725896	Ziba is kind of like DarkSakura's listener of the week type of thing.
11725936	11727017	My listener of the week.
11727077	11727678	Listener of the week.
11727798	11730120	All right.
11730521	11733724	We should have a little plaque and we should have like a listener of the month club.
11734224	11738089	We should put people in there who have earned the listener of the month.
11738849	11740791	Is that where they send us a new listener each month?
11741212	11741472	Yes.
11742113	11744976	And if we don't like it, we can send it back and get a refund.
11746465	11747286	What a freeze.
11747866	11753169	Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11753209	11756091	Looks like the phone lines have calmed down a little bit, but we'll see if any others come through.
11756111	11757052	We'll take about one more call.
11757412	11759613	In the meantime, Loki, any other news you want to get out there?
11759833	11760814	Yes, real quick.
11761374	11765057	Nintendo is still continuing to work on the Vitality Sensor.
11766097	11768559	It's apparently still about relaxing.
11769599	11773702	No word exactly on when it's going to be coming out, but who cares? !
11778466	11793973	Gran Turismo 5, hopefully coming out this November, is going to include a track editor, different weather effects, and go-karts, making it hopefully the last Gran Turismo game they ever release, because really, what more can they possibly add?
11793993	11800776	And then finally, the Wii menu has been updated to 4.3.
11800816	11800856	Um...
11804901	11815566	and apparently this is going to help you out by increasing the performance of the Wii menu system.
11816407	11820629	Oh, and removing all your homebrew stuff automatically because, you know, they don't like that.
11820909	11822670	They got you this time, Loki, right?
11822770	11823410	Hold on, we got a call.
11823690	11824611	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11824631	11824991	Who's this?
11826531	11828893	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
11828913	11829673	You forgot your own name.
11829713	11830673	Hey, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?
11833465	11834206	I'm doing alright.
11834346	11835528	What is on your mind, my friend?
11837089	11838050	Not much, not much.
11838451	11841154	First off, happy 8th year anniversary.
11841374	11842015	Thank you.
11842916	11843597	I don't know what you buy.
11843637	11845399	I mean, I've been listening for a long time.
11845419	11849003	I mean, to tell you the truth, I started listening to Outside the Box.
11850734	11851695	Thanks for watching!
11869818	11871458	Why are we not doing that again?
11872179	11880641	Like, true, we don't have control, per se, over a live network anymore, but there's this awesome technology called podcasting.
11883601	11885802	But, you know, outside the boxes, you know, pretty much it is.
11887002	11888003	Yeah, in some ways.
11888723	11889303	It is a little bit.
11889323	11893684	Yeah, it's true, because outside the box is more about the general gaming stuff, and that's kind of what we turned into, so, hey.
11894444	11894624	Yeah.
11895324	11897345	So, you know...
11898308	11899208	Good times all around.
11899609	11900289	Absolutely.
11900589	11901529	What else is on your mind?
11901549	11904931	Have you been playing any games lately or stuff you want to give a shout out to?
11904951	11909632	Well, I'm still working on Afterburner Climax.
11910793	11914474	Because me and Huawei are having a battle to the death with that.
11914594	11918096	But that's another thing.
11918196	11922457	But no, what I wanted to talk about next week, I'm doing a 4th of July party.
11922938	11926399	And I'm going to be doing a classic game thing.
11926858	11927298	Awesome!
11927618	11929319	Are you going to broadcast it or anything?
11930099	11930299	What?
11930319	11931939	Are you going to broadcast it or anything?
11931979	11934200	Or no, just your own little par-tay?
11935360	11936261	Just a little par-tay.
11936341	11937021	Okay.
11938721	11941562	Well, no, what I'm looking for is classic game suggestions.
11941822	11944503	Because right now I've got a couple games, including Blades of Steel.
11945243	11945723	Yes.
11948024	11950945	But, you know... Okay, what consoles?
11951285	11951865	What consoles?
11953005	11954026	You know, I got everything from...
11955957	11956481	Atari 400 to
11959242	11965064	Genesis, Nintendo, PS2, Dreamcast You want like party game type stuff, right?
11966124	11986950	Yeah Dreamcast, Power Stone, fuck yes, Power Stone is the best party game I don't know, Classic, Power Stone was a Capcom game on Dreamcast And it's like, everybody, it's kind of like a fighting game But it's more of like a fast action little thing, that's cool DarkSakura, you're the classic game guru Fun party games from the classic consoles
11987350	11989351	that would be awesome at this party?
11989611	11990092	Bomberman.
11990892	11991312	Okay.
11991933	11992713	With the multi-tap.
11993794	11994434	Mario Kart 64.
11994934	11997796	Or just Mario Kart, Super Mario Kart on the SNES.
11997816	11998616	That's only two players.
11999537	12000377	Can we get drunk?
12000658	12002098	Can we get drunk while we're playing it?
12003479	12005721	Pac-Man... Oh, Pac-Man Versus?
12005741	12007423	Yeah, that's always a fun one.
12007743	12009845	Not so classic, but ish.
12009885	12010926	GameCube, early GameCube.
12010986	12013227	You don't know Jack on 3DO.
12013788	12020454	I'm trying to think, oh gosh, when you get to four players, you really have to be on the Dreamcast.
12020554	12023857	The Castle Smashing... Gauntlet Legends.
12024517	12025338	Anything Gauntlet.
12025358	12026819	What was the Castle game?
12026839	12027340	Power Stone?
12033995	12047323	Rampart Joust We do have the old Tengen version of Tetris, which is pretty cool.
12047343	12050365	Tengen Tetris also has co-op play.
12050525	12052586	Or just Super Mario All-Stars.
12052846	12055168	Get drunk and try to beat the game without warping.
12056829	12060591	I tell you, meanwhile, I came up with a drinking game for After Burner.
12061494	12061854	Really?
12061954	12062514	How does it work?
12062534	12065255	Basically, whenever you get shot down, take a shot.
12066115	12067675	Oh, then you'll be really drunk.
12067855	12068236	I got one.
12069496	12073417	NBA Jam and or Maximum Hang Time.
12073957	12075017	How excited am I for that?
12075117	12079378	Or if you want to be festive, Fantavision on PlayStation 2.
12079598	12083839	Well, how about, though, if you want to get out, break out the sports, go for NBA Jam, dude.
12084159	12085579	Some comments from our chat room.
12085599	12086840	Chat has some awesome suggestions.
12086900	12088640	Gamer Girl with two R's.
12088960	12092461	Gamer Girl or Gamer Girl says Mario Party.
12092721	12093661	Hello, the cloud.
12093681	12094601	Hello, Mario Party.
12094621	12096321	But we're trying to look away from the obvious.
12096782	12099322	Rock and Roll Racing by Blizzard says Salacious Pop.
12099342	12099822	That was fun.
12100022	12100562	That's a good one.
12101542	12105223	Super Smash Brothers may be a little obvious too.
12105343	12107524	That's a staple to every party that I have.
12107544	12107984	Twisted Metal.
12108004	12108984	A lot of Gears of War, but...
12109244	12110325	Twisted Metal, that's a good one.
12111285	12115907	Or, break out and keep in mind, this was my first LAN experience ever.
12116607	12120109	Break out a whole crap ton of 486s and play some Duke Nukem.
12120209	12121449	You know what, Atari 2600?
12122210	12123910	Just go for Custer's Revenge.
12124050	12125651	Your party goers will love you.
12125891	12126752	TimeSplitters 2!
12126872	12129973	The best first person shooter ever!
12132434	12136696	Alright, SSJ100 Matt, we've given you about 50 games and you need to go and play them all.
12136716	12137076	Immediately.
12138777	12139277	It will do.
12141359	12144860	All you need is your little shit-talking machine, and you're going to have a blast.
12146081	12148443	I tell you, that thing broke, but I'm buying a new one.
12149123	12150764	As you should.
12150824	12160509	I'm telling you, when we have another USL match night, whenever Travis gets over this whole sitting on the toilet thing, you need to attend and bring your little shit-talker, because that thing's amazing.
12161230	12161510	I will.
12161930	12162410	Take care, buddy.
12163691	12164972	Take care.
12165672	12166473	That's a fun party.
12167253	12171598	I just want to point out, I was not invited to this party on that phone call, and I'm a little offended.
12171919	12172419	I'm just kidding.
12174522	12175943	It's only about 4,000 miles away.
12176384	12176724	All right.
12177145	12177946	We got to wrap up, guys.
12177966	12181269	We're going to close the Skype line for tonight, but thanks so much for the calls.
12181289	12182431	That was a fun Skype tonight.
12183783	12187627	We had some good callers tonight and some old favorites and good times.
12187968	12188528	Happy, happy.
12189009	12190611	All right, other quick stories from Loki.
12190631	12193994	I don't know if you have anything else you want to get out there, Loki, before we wrap it all up for you.
12194135	12198580	Queen, apparently the guitarist is hinting that there's going to be a Guitar Hero Queen game.
12198600	12199080	Who, Brian May?
12201062	12201263	Yes.
12202364	12204146	You know Brian May has a degree in astrophysics.
12205396	12232768	Wow Good for him You know what's awesome is that last night at our Rocky Horror Picture Show event We were actually doing a fundraiser for the Mercury Phoenix Trust Which is Freddie Mercury's kind of charity that was established in his honor And it just had me thinking like Freddie Mercury was so fucking awesome Like really Like just go YouTube some performance clips of Freddie Mercury They're really He was just fierce I mean he really was And that man could rock white spandex He really could
12233969	12242820	SSJ100Matt is sending me an invite to the party via Facebook.
12243101	12245724	I'll do the thing that everybody does and mark myself as a maybe.
12245984	12246405	That's wrong.
12249369	12258817	By the way, I had a flat tire on Saturday, so I totally couldn't do this, but they do this thing to help kittens out.
12259838	12262881	Basically, you go to PetSmart and help out with the adoption crew.
12263041	12264322	I saw something on your Facebook about that.
12264362	12267505	Yeah, I was going to do that, but then I had a big flat tire and it took forever.
12267825	12271949	And the owner of Makuni, we parked in his parking lot.
12272609	12272930	Oh, wow.
12273630	12278032	and the lug nuts were on too tight and he came out and then started talking to me in really fast Japanese.
12278753	12283915	So I was like, I just said what I could remember and he's like, oh, you know Japanese?
12283955	12288918	And he asked me and I was like, he's like, oh, that's very good.
12289358	12292940	And then he goes and kicks the lug nuts off of my car with the wrench.
12294121	12296622	Because they were on really tight so he puts them there and goes...
12297722	12298142	Like that.
12298162	12299943	I mean, seriously, this little guy.
12300984	12305065	Makuni, by the way, just to give some background, is kind of the hipster sushi chain here in Sacramento.
12305505	12311768	But I will say, they have this garlic edamame that is so good.
12312488	12313409	Oh my gosh, y'all, really?
12313429	12315129	I'm crying now, thanks.
12315289	12315950	Yeah, I know, me too.
12315970	12316990	But I totally gave him my card.
12317851	12318171	Nice.
12319211	12323293	I totally forgot when I was going with the guy, Makuni.
12324373	12324813	Nah, who cares?
12325254	12325494	Alright.
12328999	12329319	All right.
12330500	12330860	Let's see.
12330920	12335662	We're going to wrap it all up, guys, and get to the end of the show and all that.
12335702	12338963	But thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us tonight.
12339063	12342784	For eight years, we don't really do commercials during the show.
12342824	12344265	We do shout-outs for other indie stuff.
12344865	12346286	We are an indie podcast.
12346406	12347586	There's no magazine.
12347806	12349507	Our website really isn't the focus.
12349547	12354049	We don't do breaking news like the one-ups or the game spots of the world and all that.
12354909	12358171	or the giant drop the bombs and all that stuff.
12358211	12363975	We don't really get any money from doing that so we don't get advertising and we can't have big boosts at E3.
12364415	12367177	So really the only way we spread the word about our show is word of mouth.
12367257	12370999	So if you like what you hear, just tell a friend or two like Golanthro did earlier.
12371039	12374601	Tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about OLR.
12374641	12375462	That's all we really ask.
12375942	12391543	and if you're like seriously Rob none of my friends are into the podcast thing none of them will get it go leave a nice review on iTunes we really appreciate the five star reviews a couple more showed up this past week I think I saw one from Flaming Toilet who was here earlier I saw one from Internet Celebrity
12392803	12393343	DarkSakura
12419948	12421869	I miss Lesat Scourge Lounge.
12423410	12424390	We could do that in the afterbirth.
12424570	12425111	Let's do that.
12425951	12427572	Actually, maybe not tonight because we're running a little long.
12427592	12428112	Let's do that next week.
12428132	12429052	Alright, two weeks.
12429493	12430693	Alright, we're going to wrap up.
12430953	12431434	Final thoughts.
12431454	12432414	Let's go around to final thoughts.
12432894	12434655	My final thought is...
12440471	12444136	Zappy says the only indie podcast I know that has a magazine is Electric Sisterhood.
12444476	12445518	They're different though.
12445598	12447000	They're still indie.
12447360	12450364	Ninja Sister and I always seem to run into each other at cons except E3.
12450384	12451285	They have a magazine.
12451946	12453587	I guess they started their own little magazine.
12453627	12454467	I think that's awesome.
12454607	12455167	That's cool.
12455227	12456488	Well, they're kind of artists, too.
12456788	12457988	It's still an independent magazine.
12458008	12458849	It's still independent.
12458869	12459229	They count.
12459269	12459809	They count.
12459869	12466071	I actually wanted to do something like that for us since I'm big in publishing, you know, because that's actually what I want to do with my life.
12466091	12466892	It'll be fun.
12466912	12467652	It'll be fun.
12467672	12469613	There's no reason we can't have a little zine.
12469653	12472474	There's still sideways profile pictures of you guys.
12472935	12474176	You got a little camera right now?
12475957	12478178	Let's do our final thoughts before we have a business meeting.
12478619	12479960	This is what our business meetings are like.
12480440	12481120	No you!
12481501	12482181	No you!
12482501	12483122	No way!
12483382	12483822	Way!
12483842	12486884	Can we get one of the listeners to do it?
12489326	12489646	Alright.
12491628	12492650	Let's wrap up.
12492810	12493691	Final thoughts, everybody.
12493931	12496956	Drew Nami, thank you for being here to celebrate this landmark occasion with us.
12497336	12498438	Don't be a stranger.
12498738	12499739	I'll keep coming back.
12499880	12500601	All right, good for you.
12500621	12501982	But he keeps getting stranger and stranger.
12502063	12502383	All right.
12502944	12503925	Do you have a final thought for us?
12504045	12505447	By the way, how old did you turn this week? 25.
12506989	12507670	You're still a baby.
12507730	12510051	I was 17 when you guys started broadcasting.
12510071	12512053	Oh my god, I'm so old.
12512073	12513414	Our little Republican.
12514495	12515896	Our little Republican.
12516436	12519398	And we used to get into it on the politics.
12519619	12520399	Libertarian.
12521180	12522921	I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
12523181	12525403	At least he's starting to come around.
12525563	12528005	I grew up with you guys and look how I turned out.
12529162	12530423	Send him to a state school.
12530443	12531023	He'll get turned around.
12531043	12533926	Which is funny because I don't identify as libertarian anymore.
12533946	12534866	We're eight years in.
12534926	12537048	Keep listening or Axe Cop will chop up your head.
12537268	12539089	We've got to really try to get to ten.
12539730	12541991	Like, I know everybody's got their lives and all that stuff.
12542292	12544293	And, you know, we've really got to try to get to ten.
12544573	12545134	We can do it.
12545434	12545854	I know we can.
12546274	12546515	All right.
12548316	12549777	So thank you very much, Drunami, for being here.
12550017	12551398	And your final thought was?
12551618	12552819	That was my final thought.
12552859	12553560	Keep listening.
12553740	12555541	We're eight years in, but we're still going.
12555801	12556122	All right.
12556402	12557442	Still going like a bad STD.
12558323	12560663	DarkSakura, since I'm looking at you, what's your final thought?
12560683	12563224	We actually should promote him from intern to mailroom.
12564324	12565464	No, he was always going to be the intern.
12565504	12565724	Come on.
12566044	12567004	No promotions at OLR.
12567725	12569125	Mailroom means I actually get paid.
12569465	12572425	Unless you're like Dekeman or VXJasonXV.
12572465	12575366	They do a lot of work for the web stuff, so they get promotions.
12577146	12579347	Drew's an intern.
12579527	12579887	I'm chief.
12580007	12580907	Intern, I want coffee.
12582307	12582847	All right.
12584687	12586348	DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight.
12586588	12587508	Intern, update the wiki.
12588496	12589117	Work, work.
12590058	12595784	And seriously, I want our wiki to be thriving and gorgeous as it once was when it was new and shiny.
12596384	12597465	Update that bitch!
12597485	12607596	There are some people that like AJ Mix and Dark Tetsuya I see on there all the time, so they do get a sportsman-like pat on the bottom for that.
12607956	12610539	Well, I mean, like, some of our staple pages... That's no Pat.
12611460	12619828	Some of our staple pages are updated, and guys, I thank you so much for that, but we do, you know, and, you know, we all work right now.
12620809	12624233	But I do want to see some of our newer stuff updated on the wiki.
12624293	12625054	I mean, it would be nice.
12625715	12625935	Please.
12625955	12626075	Please.
12626821	12629422	SSJ100 Matt says, intern, break the soundboard table.
12629922	12630922	I can't!
12631443	12632743	It's now a soundboard chair.
12632803	12633963	We've made it intern proof.
12634244	12635804	I can't even tip it over!
12635824	12639425	We're using a very solid step stool.
12639485	12641426	I mean, it's like... It's Drew proof.
12641546	12646328	Alpha Cananogram's forcing a standoff, saying, we'll update the wiki if you give us shirts.
12648174	12650055	We're so indie that the shirts don't fit.
12650235	12652396	I remember when Intern made his own damn shirt.
12652536	12653396	That was pretty hardcore.
12653416	12655797	The Intern almost wore his damn shirt.
12655937	12656837	Almost dug it up.
12656977	12657498	Wow.
12657778	12658338	That's impressive.
12658418	12658898	Almost.
12660119	12666401	Well, all of the t-shirts that I have right now, though, all my gaming t-shirts have actually been worn and washed, so I don't know if you want to wear my leftovers.
12666661	12669922	We will... I'm waiting on my... I'll send you... Try what we can do.
12669942	12672303	I will send you a Metal Gear Solid pillowcase.
12672644	12674064	I'm waiting on my number 23 Oil Army shirt.
12674084	12674164	Loki...
12677045	12678826	Loki, your final thought tonight.
12679026	12679626	I'm tired.
12680647	12681087	Me too.
12681287	12684428	Because I was up until 1 in the morning last night.
12684668	12685689	Doing the show roll, by the way.
12686469	12692051	Actually, 1.30 I was up in the morning because I was working on the baby room mural.
12692712	12695593	So I'm on the third wall for that.
12695793	12696633	Baby.
12696773	12697934	Well, I have to get it done.
12698674	12699995	Well, the baby's going to be here soon.
12700675	12707202	Well, yeah, and because I need to... I need to get it all done so I can work on my Grand Theft Auto edits.
12708284	12709345	Alright, my final...
12710106	12710847	My final thought, wait.
12710907	12716110	Oh, and I had to wake up this morning at 6.30 to go work on the backyard and the front yard.
12716130	12717091	Remember this?
12717491	12718232	Oh, my God.
12718792	12720654	OL Army shirt, DarkSakura, zero.
12720674	12721454	That's pretty hard.
12721474	12722775	That's what I was talking about.
12723056	12724016	Put the picture on the website.
12724337	12728660	Okay, do the whole thing so the listeners can see it because us talking about it doesn't do it justice.
12729120	12729380	All right.
12730381	12731061	My final thought.
12731602	12732122	I don't have a lot.
12732503	12733964	I can't wait to go get tacos on the way home.
12734564	12735485	It's Taco Sunday.
12735545	12735645	Woo!
12738271	12754297	Alright, have a great night everybody Thank you for listening to OLR for the past 8 years We hope to bring you 8 more Have a wonderful night everybody See you in 2 weeks because there is no show So have a wonderful and safe 4th of July It's a celebration about fire But that doesn't mean you set yourself on fire
12754677	12755597	Don't be stupid.
12755838	12756618	See you in two weeks.
12781187	12785091	or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
12785651	12786492	See you next week!
