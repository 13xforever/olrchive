Tonight, June 20th, 2010, we talk about Nintendo going 3D, Microsoft going Kinect, Sony joining forces with Steam, and more on our E3 wrap-up show, live.
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome to another week of that video game talk show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
Joining you over the next three hours, my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
Hi, how are you Jamie?
I'm doing better.
You're doing a little better in the voice department, it sounds like.
Yeah, but yesterday the wind kicked up and allergies got crazy, so my voice was like... At least you don't sound as terrible as I did on some of those nightly shows for me three this week.
The Rob Robertson pals and laryngitis is what it really should have been called.
It was pretty bad.
Your pals with laryngitis?
Oh, the smartass over there is Loki, Techmaster Loki.
How are you?
I'm fine.
And did you have a good week?
and DarkSakura.
but also I do want to point out we want to talk about the stuff that you want to hear about live so make sure you join us in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening live on this Sunday night because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio www.allgames.com at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
E3 Week E3 Week
and what kind of games you played this week.
So DarkSakura, why don't you start us off.
How was your game of the week?
And by the way, actually, I should say this before you started.
DarkSakura and Loki were unable to go to E3 this year due to personal stuff.
Yeah, rub it in.
Well, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to rub it in.
But just, you know, in case the listeners are like, well, they're just going to talk about E3 all week.
No, no.
I mean, there was other games to be played besides just the ones at the LA Convention Center.
I played Star Trek Online, which I was playing when you guys got here.
And I wanted to thank Bobby for going ten minutes over because it gave me time to finish my mission.
So thank you, Bobby.
I was busy shooting Romulans.
Good times.
DarkSakura.com
Well, I do have to mention that I told you this earlier.
My teacher, I'm taking U.S.
History.
My teacher brought up the Oregon Trail.
Nice.
And she said, you remember that game, you know, where you have to stockpile meat and everything?
We're like, Oregon Trail.
She's like, yeah, that game.
It's like, well, people really did die from all this stuff.
And I told her about your shirt.
The one that said you have died of dysentery.
Yes.
And she laughed and then looked a little bit sick.
My teacher's also a little preggers.
Oh, I see.
So she carried a couple pounds back to the wagon.
Yes.
You know that game where you're on a trail to Oregon?
What's it called again?
I don't know.
All right.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
I just played Grand Theft Auto.
That's pretty much it.
That's it?
That's all I had time for.
I don't think I played anything else.
Oh, a little bit of Earth Defense Force.
Just getting through that some more.
But mainly just Grand Theft Auto because I had to go lose a game by $2 one day.
So that means I had to take it out on my coworkers by kicking the crap out of them.
It was funny, though, because one of the games actually quadrupled second place's score.
I had $4,000 and the person below me had $1,000.
I kicked the crap out of them that was in 15 minutes too by the way apparently my boss was bragging to Take-Two because they had a meeting with them about how wonderful I am at Grand Theft Auto to which I'm sure they didn't care yeah I was gonna say I don't think Take-Two would really be concerned with how good you are he's like did you know that there's somebody that works with us that's in the top 100 in the world no really
Which I was like, okay, whatever.
You were glued to the E3 press conferences all week though, right?
Yeah, I watched those instead of working because I can do that.
So were we.
We were watching from our hotel room because we don't get invited to fun stuff like that, but that's okay.
So we got to watch them all from the comfort of our historic hotel room in downtown LA, not far from where all the rioting was taking place after Game 7, but I digress.
What did you think of all the press conferences as you were watching them, Loki?
Okay.
They were pretty cool.
I mean, what was kind of unique, I guess, is no one really kind of failed at press conferences.
I mean, there wasn't any... Nintendo, thank God, did not show anything about the vitality sensor, which makes me believe that they're not putting it out anymore.
I think they kept, what's her name, Cammy Tied up in a burlap bag backstage somewhere She was unable to be freed Hopefully sufficiently beaten Aw, poor thing She's trying to do her job
I don't know, what do we want to talk about?
Just each press conference, or do we want to... Well, I want to talk about my gaming week, because I played about 40 games this week.
So let's get started.
Well, take your time.
Alright, no, no, I'm not going to repeat... Oh, I will talk about something, because it is gaming related, but not video games.
I've been working on the baby's room some more and doing stuff regarding that.
I'm building a custom mobile.
I've actually done the wiring for it and it works perfectly.
Well, except for yesterday because I broke it, but that was just from trying to show people and the wire came off, but I can fix that.
Anyway, so I have this thing now where if I flip a switch, an on-off switch, it basically plays an MP3 lullaby of the Super Mario Bros.
theme.
At the same time, it will also spin a motor.
That's pretty awesome.
I'm going to shove it into an acrylic cube that's going to become a question block and
And I've started drawing on the wall.
I posted on Twitter and Facebook the design I have for the room, which is looking like New Super Mario Bros.
That sounds so adorable I could barf, honestly.
I'm not going to recap everything I played at the actual E3 show because we had the daily shows and I'm sure a lot of them will come up as we go over tonight's news which is going to be a little more freeform tonight and if you guys have questions in chat and during the Twitter topics and calls if you want to know if I touched a certain game I'd be happy to give you my thoughts on it
Thanks for watching!
I think it takes a lot of guts to put your game out there on the show floor at E3.
Guts that clearly Activision and Blizzard don't have anymore from not having their booths open to the public, quote unquote, at E3.
But didn't they quit E3 last year?
Well, they still had a booth.
I mean, most everything was behind closed doors at that booth, but they've been scaling further and further back.
But I'm digressing a little bit.
I could go on this whole other tangent about BlizzCon and Blizzard and how I am a big stan of World of Warcraft.
I love that game.
It's amazing.
I am not fucking going to BlizzCon ever.
Ever.
Because it's a joke.
They should have just had a big sign out front of their booth that says, Seriously, you've seen this stuff before.
It's just more of the same.
Yeah.
Well, anyway, I'm getting off the path a little bit, because I actually did play games that weren't just at E3, so I want to get those out of the way, because I know most of the people listening to this show didn't go to E3, so you guys are probably playing a lot of standby games to catch up on, just like I was.
So I will mention this.
I played... You might remember a couple weeks on the show, I said, I'm going to beat three games this summer, and I'm falling a little behind on my goal, but I finally found a game I want to play to completion after getting about a third of the way through it.
Um...
I played Alan Wake, which is a game that was a long time in the making.
It was from Microsoft Game Studios, one of their internal development teams that created the game.
I guess you could say it's kind of Microsoft's answer to Silent Hill, but a little less of the crazy creatures and things of that sort.
and a little more of the like strange paranormal sort of stuff I really like how immersive the game feels to me I like a lot of the small touches that they've done with the game like there's these little TVs that when you come across them will play little episodes of the Twilight Zone or at least kind of their version of that I think they call it Night Springs is what they call it which Shane pointed out to me is because the town name is called Bright Falls so Night Springs is like the opposite of that and I didn't catch that right away it's funny
I really love the fog effects are very scary and I think they're done very well and I think it's a survival horror game it's it's pretty cool it's immersive it feels like you're watching a TV show and it's been compared to Twin Peaks in other places and I think that's a very fair comparison because you have a lot of those eccentric characters strange stories WTF is going on feeling and
and yeah, I'm really liking Alan Wake so far.
It's a good game.
Lots of little things to collect for achievements and so forth.
Great environments to interact with.
Very large environments where you'll be walking down a trail and then suddenly you get in a car and drive to the other side of the map and this is all seamless where you kind of maybe started the mission earlier but everything has changed since you were gone.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
so when I do beat this game I will kind of come back and let you know if I was as disappointed as some of the other reviewers were the episodic content that's coming out port 2 I think should be interesting oh yeah there's at least two coming out but they have a countdown timer in the game to when the first one's coming out by the way the game has major product placement which I found very shameless product placement like Alan Wake uses a Verizon telephone the car that he's driving in one scene has Sync by Microsoft in it
and Energizer Batteries are what you use in the light which is a very interesting battle mechanic it's not like Silent Hill where you kind of have to run away from everything you can do that but it's very much a kind of light versus dark sort of thing in Alan Wake and the goal is you have to you burn them down with your flashlight and then they're vulnerable to get shot
and you can kind of go through and kill things but you can use light from different sources not just your flashlight but you can use the headlights on a car you could attract the monsters towards a pole that has light shining from it and it would burn them down it's very interesting I'm surprised that Energizer would agree to have their batteries in a game where you have to keep collecting batteries because they keep running out really fast it's like
Uh, shouldn't I just collect one Energizer battery and be done with it for the whole game?
I mean, isn't that the message we're trying to send across?
Well, if you don't burn your batteries by, because like you can focus the light energy on a monster and that burns your batteries real quick.
But if you don't do that, you can burn them down very slowly, although it's tough to dodge them that way.
And then your batteries slowly recharge.
So if you're kind of smart about the way you do it, you don't ever burn through a battery.
DarkSakura.com
Well, maybe that's the trick.
I don't know.
So, yeah, Alan Wake.
I had a good time with that.
So that's one of the games I've been playing outside of the whole E3 show.
Also, we took a trip to Arcade Infinity one of the nights we were there at E3.
Just to go, you know, see what's new over there.
So what's new over there?
Well, new versions of all the same damn games we've been playing for 10 years.
I played Guitar Freaks X... What the hell are they on now?
X5, I think?
I don't know.
I just lost count.
It does.
It doesn't matter.
It's the same fucking game I played 10 years ago just with new music.
So whatever.
It was fine.
I played DJ Max Technica.
Don't the X games have like the... No way.
I didn't play it myself.
I watched Shane play it.
I thought I was playing it.
Were the X games the ones that have like the extra buttons on it or is that the different one I'm thinking of?
No.
I'm thinking of the DX ones or something or GX or I don't know what the hell it's called.
Who cares?
It's damn guitar free.
I played Poppin' Music The Movie.
I don't even know what version of the game that is.
It's like 16 or something.
Whatever.
I played that for a little bit.
You know, playing big buttons.
See, Konami?
This is the game you can put out 16 versions of.
Not beaten groovy.
I don't understand where you're getting confused.
How do we make this game again?
and then I played a little bit of DJ Max because Shane made me because I was like, oh, there's actually some songs in Technica I really like and he's like, really?
You gotta play DJ Max on the PSP?
You can play these songs?
And he's like, you can do four button, five button, six button.
So I ended up playing a little bit of that too and he was strongly encouraging me to buy DJ Max on the PSP which I might, maybe at some point.
There were some songs I liked.
It's not worth it.
Really?
I've tried it on PSP.
You can get it for like, with all the sales going on right now and used and everything, like 10 bucks.
That might be worth it then.
so alright so that was the games outside of E3 that I played I don't know you guys want to know just here in studio about anything at E3 were you curious about any of the stuff the games there that you might have heard I got my hands on um
Marvel vs. Capcom 3, did you try that at all?
I did.
They had about 10 characters playable on the show floor.
I got to actually play it twice.
The lines were excruciatingly long at Capcom's booth, but the game was also at Microsoft's booth and Sony's booth.
So the lines were much shorter at Microsoft's booth.
So I did play it.
I had a team of Ryu, Morgan, Felicia in one of them.
And I used Deadpool in another one just for Jamie because I know she'd be happy if I did that.
And I think I used Captain America.
And I'm not super into this series.
I was always more of a Capcom versus SNK fan.
But it played a lot like 2 to me.
It just had more stylistic graphics.
I like the way it looks.
it didn't flip into like that 3D as much as I thought it would like Street Fighter 4 does you know what I mean like I mean it's not a 3D game but you know Street Fighter 4 like a lot of it has the 3D elements it didn't do that as much as I thought it would I mean during some of the specials and so forth but I think if you're a fan of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 you're not going to be disappointed it's a high def widescreen cel-shaded stylistic game and I'm sure y'all will be happy
I saw the Iron Man vs. Morgan
well there's an extended trailer that's all those little cutscenes or whatever he has one part where he gets attacked by her she has like those like spikes or whatever that come out and he gets they hit him in the ass Dante looked like a badass character Shane was playing as Dante and he was whooping me and it took like two of my characters to bring Dante down but then I guess Chris is either really hard to use or just stinks or something because I took him out like that and then we were even again yeah
Dead Rising 2, Full of Lulz
So like you could pick this up and then like he would push it into the zombie and chop him in half.
Maybe like a mulcher?
Yeah, like a mulcher type of thing.
It was awesome.
I laughed my ass off.
They had that in the first game sort of.
Did they?
Well, it was different.
It was like an actual lawnmower that I remember.
I have a feeling Dead Rising 2 is really just kind of more of the same, but we laughed.
Who cares?
It's a great formula.
We laughed and laughed.
There's only one thing they needed to do and that was just fix the save system.
That's done.
We're good.
Look at our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you're listening to us live on Sunday night.
Why not come join us?
There's a lot of comments from chat about questions and comments.
TigerClaw says, I like how Deadpool yells, you pressed the wrong button when he loses in the game.
I didn't see that, but it's so loud on the show floor you can't really hear a lot of the games.
I will say though, one of the soundtracks that sounded like I could hear was the Tron game that they were demoing at the Disney booth.
I played the Tron game on PlayStation 3.
Okay, here's what it is.
Imagine Prince of Persia got totally re-skinned with Tron graphics.
That's what the fucking Tron game is.
See, I thought it was more of like the Force Unleashed in the Tron universe type thing.
I know.
It played like Prince of Persia.
Like even the demo, you do the wall walking, the big flips, the jumping over objects.
It really felt like Prince of Persia to me.
But it used the Daft Punk soundtrack, like I could tell.
And so I'm like, oh, this has a sweet soundtrack to it.
It was very nice and very stylistic with the discs being thrown and everything going in slow motion.
But I think a lot of people, like Shane never saw Tron and he's kind of looking at me playing the game and he's going, the graphics in this suck.
And I'm like, it's Tron.
They're wireframe graphics.
This is what it's supposed to look like.
He'll learn.
He didn't get it.
In due time.
I know.
He'll get it someday.
Um, let's see, other questions from chat at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
Uh, some folks wanting to know, it looks like, um, uh, who's asked it here?
Um, Ray Ayanami is saying it's yet another Symphony of the Night remake.
I guess they're talking about the Castlevania game.
Oh, Tiger Claw is asking, did you play the new Castlevania game?
I did.
Um...
It does use a lot of the same skins from Symphony of the Night and it plays very similar, but yet at the same time it feels a lot different because it has what I call this Neo Geo effect where it zooms in and out of parts of the castle.
Mode 7!
Well, you can control that.
It's not arbitrary.
You control that by clicking the left or the right button, one of them.
You would actually control that.
But I found it very hard to get through the maze.
It was a hard rush for 10 minutes.
The problem with the game is that no one was really explaining the game to us and there was no on-screen rules or whatever in the demo, so we just kind of had to figure it out.
And yeah, it really did feel a lot like Symphony of the Night.
But the multiplayer element does seem to add something pretty cool to it.
And yes, you can do co-op or competitive.
So that's kind of fun.
I think it'll be a fun little arcade title.
Depends what they charge for it.
If they try to charge like $30 for it, no.
$15 is fine.
It seems like it'll be a good deal for $15.
$15 is a new $5.
The other Castlevania game I can tell was not a Castlevania game when it started.
It looked a lot more like God of War or Bayonetta.
But it's really pretty.
And it's very stylistic.
And it has sparkle ponies.
And it has Sir Patrick Stewart doing some of the voiceover works in between montages.
I want him to be a playable character.
There was this cool little sequence where you're on a wolf that's kind of riding and you can jump onto the other wolf and throw the guy off.
It's Castlevania meets God of War.
But I think if people are expecting an old school Castlevania game...
The arcade game is for you, not this new one.
This new one is a different direction for the series.
What if they call that level Operation Wolf?
Let's see.
Other comments.
Oh, it looks like some folks are asking about the 3D Castlevania game there as well.
Let's see.
Folks talking about the Tron.
TigerClaw says, hopefully the multiplayer will kick ass.
Like if they have the classic light cycle versus light cycle from the original Tron in 3D.
That's the Wii game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I will tell you about a couple other games just kind of off the top of my head.
There's a few that I want to talk about for sure.
A couple of them are music based so bear with me a minute.
Rock Band 3 is going to be a worthy upgrade.
They talked very quickly about some of the stylistic changes that they've made to the menus where...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
they have put in filters on the song list and I know a lot of people are wondering this all of the Rock Band songs are importable into Rock Band 3 with the exception of the Beatles which I don't think comes as a surprise to anyone but this Uber machine that they were playing on had Rock Band 2, Lego Rock Band, Green Day Rock Band I mean everything else was importable this Uber machine they were playing on had like 1300 songs it was nuts I know all about that the realistic mode
I didn't understand it at all on guitar because I don't play the guitar guitar is really confusing 120 well essentially 120 I mean I'm sure it's just like
Yeah, I don't know how to play the guitar.
I don't know how to play the guitar, but watching the guy play that White Stripes song, and then they plugged in an amp at the same time, because there's two guitar peripherals.
One of them has all the buttons, and then the other one's like a real guitar that you can use to play rock band, basically, in this special mode.
I guess they double jacked it into the game and the amp, and what they did, they turned down the game volume and turned up the amp, and he was playing the White Stripes song.
It was like the real song.
So I think this will answer a lot of people's calls, like, well, if you
and especially music snobs and people in the bands.
Rock Band isn't real guitar players.
It is funny though, that game Power Gig gets announced way back and everyone's like, oh my god, it's a game that's going to teach you how to play guitar.
And then Rock Band 3 comes out, oh, it's exactly the same thing.
Ah, crap.
But I will say one instrument I know a little more about is the keyboards and getting to see the real keyboard mode.
I was like, whoa, cool.
I do want to correct one thing I had said, speculated, I guess I should say earlier on the show, and that is when you're playing in the five bar mode, I think that's what they call it, the five bar mode, which is, you know, like regular rock band on the keyboard.
Thanks for watching!
Uh, Dr945 in our chatroom, chat.orangeandre.com, excuse me, TheDr945 says, have you guys seen the complete track list wall?
That's a lot of songs on Rock Band.
Yes, it was in their booth.
It was right across from where we were playing Rock Band 3.
It is very impressive.
And they also had a bar graph.
I don't know if that made it into the pictures as well.
That says, here's how many they have in Rock Band, here's how many are in Guitar Hero.
There's a lot less.
Um...
I really really didn't want to like Dance Central but I do the Kinect games because I kind of and I'll let Loki kind of cover Microsoft's press conference and some of the highlights and lowlights in a minute but I think a lot of us walked away from Microsoft's press conference kind of going these Kinect seem like the gimmicky crap we saw on the Wii a couple years ago
Thanks for watching!
If you've ever taken a dance class, it's basically how they break it down in a dance class.
A long time ago in high school, I took a street dance class during sophomore year or something.
And it was fun for a summer.
And basically what they do is they teach you small little bits, different techniques or whatever, and then you string it together in a routine.
And that's basically what this game is.
They teach you a bunch of small techniques and then you string it together in a routine.
Which is cool.
I think that's... I'm not sure if I would actually play this a lot because my wife would just not get it.
She would just be like, you look like a dumbass.
I could see it right now.
It would be kind of fun though.
I still may get it anyways.
God, no.
It's not going to ever appear on the internet with me in a video.
Never ever.
Unless I get really good at it.
In which case, maybe.
But even still, no.
Um...
So, I mean, that's kind of cool, and the song list looks pretty cool on it, but if we're going to compare it to, say, Dance Masters, let me put it this way.
If you took what you learned from Dance Central and actually went to a club and did it, you might look alright.
If you took Dance Masters and did what they have in that game, you're going to look like an idiot.
I don't know if I go that far because I think it was hard to see what they were and I wanted to get into Dance Masters but for me the biggest difference between the two games is yeah the style of dance was definitely different between the two but it's the song list and that's really what's going to ultimately come down to
and if just I'm sorry if Dance Masters continues down this path of DDR looking songs there's going to be a niche audience for it which is most of the people that you know have grown up with this show for the past eight years since we started talking exclusively about DDR but Dance Central will be the game that sells superior to it in America anyway I don't think Dance Central is even going to come out in Japan and I think Dance Masters will rule over there
Here's the thing though about Dance Masters and actually Dance Central.
I'd be more willing to back Dance Central because I know how Harmonix is with download content.
They will deliver on download content.
Konami, they've promised to deliver on download content for every single dance game that's come out.
Even the Karaoke Revolution games that have come out.
Never have they actually come through.
It's just been, oh, we'll put out a couple things, download content, we're done.
and DarkSakura.com.
I know I clearly said, get over it.
Para Para Paradise is never coming to the U.S.
Absolutely will not happen.
Sure enough, here we are seven, eight years later.
Dance Masters is basically Para Para Paradise.
I mean, they're going to tell you different songs.
It's not all Eurobeat, professionally choreographed, but it's still the army.
Here's my thing.
Because the only song that I saw, I mean, they have like two songs that they showed.
They showed one, it was like some...
I can understand if those maybe have like para dancing to them because it's more Japanese, you know, the para club stuff.
Now, the other songs that are in the game that say are other genres of music, you know, do those have different types of dancing, different styles?
Because that might be kind of all right.
If it's all para, like if it's para to like some, you know, pink song or something like that.
That's a little weird
I actually thought though, I will say this, I actually thought Dance Masters was the more graphically appealing game in kind of looking at them both side to side.
I mean, I think in the end, Dance Central was the more like easier to follow kind of dance, but I thought Dance Masters kind of looked better in some ways.
It's hard to explain.
I think a lot of people...
are probably going to just end up picking up both especially the crowd that I think mostly listens to this show but I think ultimately Dance Central is going to prevail in the sales here I'll check out the other one but I think Dance Masters will do better overseas well absolutely so but yeah I had a good time with those games
Those were the music games.
How about something for the non-music game fans?
Real quick, I was going to say one thing.
It wasn't shown on the floor or anything, but one of the games that I saw footage of that I thought was really awesome is DJ Hero 2.
They're going to be doing the karaoke part.
I do like all the different stuff that they have now where the
Samples that you do during the freestyle portions are actually part of the song.
It's not just crappy Flava Flav samples over top of everything.
And also the freestyle scratching, the freestyle crossfading stuff looks pretty cool.
You know what game unfortunately I did not get my hands on but Shane did and he swears it was probably one of the best games he played at the show?
DJ Hero 3D.
Yes, I actually want to pick that up.
It looks awesome.
From what I understand, it was a really great experience on the 3DS, so I wish I'd seen it myself, but no, I got to play some other stuff.
I think I played Sims 3 on the 3DS, actually, funny enough, which takes your picture and then builds your little Sims character to look like you.
Do you know how huge my nose was?
I was a little offended, actually.
That's still a pretty cool feature.
I hope they have that in the other versions.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
I just don't want to see how fat my Sim's going to be.
Well, luckily it only takes pictures of your face.
Cannot fit on screen.
Only takes pictures of your face, luckily.
I'm like, I have more hair left than that.
That's for the 3DS version.
You never know with these Kinect cameras and moving stuff.
Harmonix, Dance Central, Dance Masters, Parapara
but when I say that it's not six streams that you break it is nothing like that at all it is tracing motions on the screen and then posing in certain ways it's like Parapar and Elite Beat Agents combined yes that's a good way of describing it actually
All right.
How about some non-music games for a minute?
Because there's one that really surprised me at the show.
They exist.
Yes.
Are you going to, by the way, Jamie, since you have the mic up for a minute, I want to ask you, is there a dance game that you're going to pick up?
Or are you like, no, thank you, I don't really want to dance, or what?
No, I think that I want to play Parapara at home.
And it's actually kind of funny because just a few days ago I was thinking about hooking up the biscuits.
No, what you should have done is done the, because you probably know the Night of Fire routine, right?
No, not by heart.
Oh, well.
What about Shane?
No, Shane doesn't play Para.
No.
I would have been able to do Boom Boom Fire.
It's probably the only one I still remember after all these years.
Hey, I went and played the Para around the corner on Arcadia, and I remembered my stuff.
I could shake my butt.
I probably could have remembered with the stuff on the screen, but why did I need to do it?
Bobby Blackwolf, there's a video of him on the internet doing the Night of Fire routine.
You should have done it.
Free publicity, Rob.
When I got up there, Shane specifically said, you better not play Night of Fire.
So I did the Smile DK song.
Thank you, Shane.
I did the Smile DK song.
All right.
I want to get past this.
I do want to say this, though, because somebody who was doing the Night of Fire dance right there at the booth the day I was there, Naoki was there on the floor.
I got a picture with him.
I got to put it on Facebook.
I promised you if I had a chance to meet Naoki, I would ask him one question.
And that question is, and this is how the interaction went, I said, you know,
Hi there, can I get a picture?
And then he said, you know, thank you.
And I said, hold on, just one question.
I said, is that Facebook really you?
And he doesn't speak very good English.
He was kind of like Facebook.
And I was like, Facebook.
And I kind of pointed at my phone because I don't know how else to describe Facebook.
I'm like, is it you?
And I'm kind of like pointing on Facebook.
And he's like, oh, yes, yes, me on Facebook.
And so, yes, that Naoki Facebook is really him.
They made the mistake, and I kind of feel bad.
They made the mistake of him actually speaking during the Konami press conference, and that was the most weird thing.
He's adorable.
Come on.
I know he's adorable, but he doesn't speak good English.
So give the guy a damn translator.
Same with the guy that was describing 99 Nights.
If you keep pushing X button and Y button, the game will suck.
Or you will be sucked.
Come on, dude.
You need a translator.
Don't just let this guy wing it.
Do not hate on Naoki on this show.
He is adorable.
You know what he looks like in person?
A hyper little kitty cat.
He was running around the stage taking little pictures with his iPhone.
He was so happy that people were playing the game and having fun with it.
He was so happy.
And more props to him.
And I know it's not his fault that...
some of the last DDR games have really been terrible and you know and I kind of feel bad in that sense because they've taken what he created and just kind of took a big dump on it like they did with Beat and Groovy but it's just it's not it's very awkward okay they had a lot of awkward moments during the Konami press conference speaking of which and I know it's just kind of like whatever Glee karaoke revolution game worst game I played at E3 yes I played it and it's terrible
and I officially don't give a crap about Glee it was one of those things when we walked in Konami's booth and I kind of looked over and I saw I mean it's huge it was no secret I was like I kind of did that moment of of course of course I should have fucking seen that coming I should have known should have had Shane play Def Jam rap star
No, no, no, no.
Here's why the Glee game was bad.
They've basically just done away with the character models and everything.
It just plays videos from Glee that sometimes match up with the song and sometimes just completely random videos.
And it just, it's, it's not that great.
I think I sat there.
I think we sang like, I don't even know what song we sang, but I was singing like this.
I was going...
Perfect!
Yep, 95%.
Granted, I was on the easiest level, but jeez.
Alright.
Alright.
Please, a non-music game.
Please, please, please, may I talk about a non-music game?
No.
Because there was a non-music game I played at the show.
Child of Eden looks awesome, by the way.
I'm done.
Shut up!
It does look very awesome, though.
There's Kinky Rockets in it.
They're doing the soundtrack.
Dude, I love Kinky Rockets.
Hey!
Hey, listen!
Who did you play?
Or did you make your own character?
it's all make your own character you cannot play as Batman or Wonder Woman or any of that they play as guys but all the raid gear quote-unquote is like clones of Wonder Woman and Superman and all that so it looks like you know we didn't get to do too much of the character creation it was all PvP but it looks like your characters can kind of go down a Batman-y path or a
Wonder Woman-y path.
And the guy who demoed it was really great.
He was one of the better demonstrators I was working with during E3.
He really was trying to kind of... He could tell we were WoW players, and he was kind of just trying to break it down, like what some of the differences were.
And he said that they don't want people to be kind of pigeonholed into these tank and healer and DPS roles.
They kind of want everybody to be able to do everything.
And I thought that was pretty cool, and
I just liked it.
It was more action-based.
Here's the thing you need to keep in mind.
DC Universe is a much more action-based MMO.
Like, the only action MMO I've really played to any extent is Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Universe.
I love PSO.
But, I mean, the action in that is really super slow compared to DC Universe.
I mean, Phantasy Star is like sword, sword, sword.
DC Universe Punch, Punch, Punch, Ice Storm Drink a soda to refuel Fly up I need to get this game when it comes out November 2nd Part of the PVP we were doing was Heroes vs. Villains All the people that were out on the show floor were basically the heroes The villains were the people in the private rooms getting screened the game The guy was like, I'm really not supposed to show you this but do this
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Boom!
All of the villains went flying out of the room because the EMP device, it's like a magnet thing that pushes them all out.
And I was like, that was fucking rad.
I can have this game now, please.
And the greatest part was knowing that all those villains were the mucky muck press people in the super secret screenings.
So I had a really good time with DJ Universe, DC Universe.
So I want to pick that full game up when it comes out.
Final Fantasy XIV, we had a demo of that as well, speaking of MMOs The game looks astonishing I feel like this game is not as far along as they would like it to be I can also say, just knowing some people that are in the private alpha right now The alpha
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Thank you!
I know, it seems like they've really fixed a lot of that.
As long as they got rid of the level cap quests, I'm good with that.
Now it's just a matter of making the game run smooth, because even in the Uber, I was noticing some frame rate issues, and I like my games to run very smoothly, so I was a little...
I don't know if this is out there a lot, but the PC and PS3 versions are not cross-server at this time.
Yeah, that's what they said last year too.
And it sounds like a lot of the reason because of that, it's not that the developer doesn't want to do it, but it sounds like a lot of the reason has to do with balancing issues.
It's really different when somebody's playing on the PS3 versus the PC.
And I do think Sony's kind of a little bit of a... Did you play it on the PS3 or the PC?
I played it on the PS3.
Yeah, PS3 was actually pretty easy to control.
Yeah, I was very surprised.
For an action-y game, it was cool.
TigerClaw in chat wants to know, and we're getting like 40 minutes into the show.
We'll get into some news here and stuff in a minute.
TigerClaw says, did you get a chance to check out the new Twisted Metal?
I watched other people play it, but I am not the big fan of the series that Loki is and so forth.
I was very excited that they talked about the new Twisted Metal.
I bet you were.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I do want to say some housekeeping real quick, though, because, you know, we're 40 minutes into the show, just now getting to housekeeping.
Next week is our eight-year anniversary of Orange Lounge Radio.
Actually, technically, it's during the week this week.
June 23rd, 2002 was our very first show, so happy eight week, or eight weeks, happy eight years to us next week.
Weeks seem like so long.
We're not doing anything special for it, really, just the same old thing we usually do.
But just, you know, kind of want to thank our listeners for the support over the eight years of this show.
there will be no show the week after that that next Sunday is the actual 4th of July which of course is a holiday here in the states and just due to other things we all want to do that night there will be no show on the 4th of July so that's really it for housekeeping otherwise join us on Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio join us on Twitter twitter.com slash OLR we're still taking Twitter topics if you have a story you want to share or questions about E3 you want to ask mailbag is always open as well mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
So the beginning of the show tonight, we wanted to keep it a little more freeform just in kind of wrapping up what happened at E3 and kind of summarizing the press conferences and what everybody kind of thought of the news.
Loki, what do you want to say about Microsoft?
Because they started everything off the first night before the actual floor show began.
Microsoft came out there, and in a nutshell...
focused mostly on Kinect and a bunch of games that we kind of already knew were coming.
There was no new games outside of Kinect that were announced besides the one game that I don't even remember the name of it now.
That's the type of impression it had on me.
I know what you're talking about, the Crytek Microsoft Game Studios.
Yes, that game.
That I thought was 300 The Game, because that's what it looked like, 300 The Game.
So that'll be interesting, because Crytek does some really good work.
Stuff that I thought was interesting about that press conference, and we'll go over every little detail, but just some of the basic stuff.
The ESPN stuff coming to Xbox Live Marketplace, the actual streaming, I think is kind of cool.
Not for me, perhaps, because I don't give a crap about sports, but for people that do like sports, and there's a lot of them out there, I think that's kind of neat.
The whole movie connect thing where you can control stuff just by voice command, almost like sync, and...
You know, motion gestures and stuff like that.
That's kind of neat.
Can I back up a little bit about the ESPN thing?
Because, you know, it kind of goes in that whole integrated television thing.
And I did think that was cool.
Like, I'm not into sports either as much as other people.
I thought it was, you know, I might put the local team in and just kind of try, you know, Sacramento Kings.
Because that way I'll know if my coworkers are going to be in a good mood or a bad mood the next day.
You know, I'll kind of track that in the ESPN thing.
But I don't think I'll use it for a lot more other than that.
But what really disappointed me was that when we were talking about TV integration, I think one of the things that Microsoft did so well in this past year was 1 versus 100.
And there was literally no news on that front.
Not that game, not any of the other types of games that they were talking about.
I was extremely disappointed that that subject didn't even come up.
Yeah, that's too bad.
But other stuff, obviously, Kinect was pretty cool.
They shot off a bunch of different game demo examples with that, including, of course, Kinectimals, which I think was pretty cool.
If you're going to do one of those sim animal games, that is seriously the way to do it.
To me, it was so well done.
I think it's going to be a really big game with...
And when you compare that to the eyepet stuff, it just seems a little more natural to me instead of just trying to play with this augmented reality creature type thing.
I don't know, it's like Milo in animal form almost.
I was bored watching it.
Yeah, but it's not meant for us.
Yeah, but I feel like hardcore gamers really got the shaft at Microsoft's thing.
We didn't get anything.
I mean, there's a bunch of games we already knew about.
Yeah, but they didn't have anything that was really meant for the hardcore gamer with Kinect.
And isn't that the mistake Nintendo made four years ago?
It is.
As recent as last year?
It's possibly that way, but they may be relying more on third parties to do that stuff.
But the problem is they've got the hardcore audience right now.
They're not trying to bring in more people necessarily.
They have the hardcore gamers.
They don't need to worry about the hardcore gamers leaving because there's no Kinect games for them.
They're trying to bring on the casual audience that's not playing the Xbox 360 right now.
I still kind of think, and I know some folks may argue with me and so forth, because the press conferences are for everybody and it's so that they can get the coverage and so forth.
But I'm like, but this is E3.
You know what I mean?
Even CNN, who's covering E3, sends their tech guys who play a lot of video games to E3.
And I don't think there is on the up and up on a lot of this stuff.
I mean, if Xbox wants to show off a lot of these Kinect things, I mean, I understand why it's a big part of the press conference, but...
Some of these games could have been relegated to being debuted on the Ellen Show or something for the appropriate audience.
You know what I mean?
I just feel like it's not just the 1 vs. 100 thing, but no mention of Game Room, which really doesn't surprise me, sadly, or just any other big holiday hardcore titles that we didn't already know about was a little disappointing to me.
Honestly, I think it would have been better if they never announced Gears 3 a couple months ago.
I think they should have kept it under wraps.
I don't think there was any advantage to them blowing that on the Jimmy Fallon show or whatever show it first showed up on.
um yeah I understand that but at the same time you know like I said their focus with Kinect is not necessarily the hardcore gamers they've already got them with you know the stuff that they have coming out and there will be stuff later on that will support the hardcore gamer crowd but it's just not gonna be the launch stuff it's mainly just you know more of the casual audience that they're trying to capture in and then you know maybe they'll convert some of the hardcore gamers over later on to trying that stuff um
And so there's a lot of stuff that they showed off there.
Obviously, you've got your Wii Sports clone, your Wii Sports Resort type thing with Kinect Adventures, Kinect Sports.
Seriously, Kinect Sports.
Couldn't you have done something a little bit different?
Call it Kinect Athletics or something like that.
It's just so much of almost a ripoff, you know?
DarkSakura.com
and does he look kind of pissed?
He looks sour.
That could just be a bad freeze frame though, you know?
How like a video is what, like 30 pictures a second, you know?
Yeah.
But I still think it's kind of funny.
It is funny.
I'd like to see somebody make a comic out of that.
Um, and what I was going to say, some of the stuff that they did show that's kind of borderline on the hardcore games that they showed, like integration or possible integration with Forza.
And to me, that looked just kind of dumb.
I mean, okay, look, with Kinect, you can look around a car, like a virtual car, and look at different stuff on the car.
I don't care.
Or you can drive, you know, by holding your hands in the air like a steering wheel.
My arms would get tired.
Especially, you know, gamers out there, we're not in the best shape, and that's gonna be, you know... Didn't Joyride look like Excite Truck to you, though?
No.
Joyride totally looked like Excite Truck to me.
I mean, I guess the colors and stuff are the same.
I heard Joyride was on Rails, someone was saying.
Was it?
I don't know, I didn't play it at all.
I looked like they were doing the tricks and jumping through rings and stuff.
They really reminded me of Excite Truck.
And what happened to Joyride being a free game?
Hello, it was supposed to be a free game on Xbox Live Arcade, and then with paid download content and stuff, it was supposed to be a whole new different experiment.
And they just decided, yeah, you know what, we're just going to charge $60 for it.
That game is not worth $60.
Maybe it'll be a pack-in game with the Kinect?
Because a lot of folks are speculating Kinect is $150 right now, which is fine, but, I mean, if you have to buy a game separately, then aren't you really paying $210 to play a game on Kinect?
It's the same thing if you even talk about, like,
Look at the bundles that they have right now for the PlayStation Move.
You can get a bundle that comes with the Move controller, the camera, and a game for $130.
And that's not including the extra controller that you need for some of the other games.
Kind of the nunchuck for the Move type thing.
Which you don't necessarily need, but come on.
You're going to need it if you want to be able to play everything out there.
I've been looking at pictures from it.
That's one thing that would have made me a little happier.
See, that's more of like a hardcore game.
Yes, exactly.
Why waste my time with Wii Sports clones?
We all know you're going to rip off the Wii.
Quit wasting my time.
That's just pretty.
I think they should have shown the Child of Eden demo.
But maybe it wasn't ready or whatever.
I'm just absolutely... Look, the fail whale made an appearance.
What?
I think a lot of times though with these demos they're really nervous about things going wrong like the things have to be exactly perfect case in point what happened with the Zelda demonstration Nintendo's press conference they were having a lot of problems and what's funny is that was the first thing I don't mean to skip ahead but that was the first thing Nintendo was showing at their press conference and it started to make a lot of us go here we go in Nintendo's fail conference 2010 and then Reggie just kind of was like you know
No, we'll get into that in a minute.
But definitely the tone changed quickly.
What did you think of yourself fitness on the Kinect?
I thought that was kind of neat.
I think that's Kinect's biggest strength.
I think that's where Kinect stands to make a lot of money right now.
And if they're smart, they're going to do tie-ins with the Biggest Loser TV show and some of these exercise platforms.
They do have a Biggest Loser game coming.
And who called it here on the show?
And you were like, no, they already have a Biggest Loser game.
Okay.
I'm a games analyst.
Anyway, all joking aside, I think the exercise gaming is going to be Kinect's biggest strength and I think is where they should go with it.
Get off the couch, Fatty, play some Kinect.
Other things that they had out of the conference, let's see, Fable 3.
I could care less about Fable 3.
Basically, Fable 3 to me, you could have just shown me footage from Fable 2, it would look the same.
I played what they had available on the show floor I didn't understand what the hell was going on because it was kind of in the middle of a quest already I noticed that the little golden trails were still there telling you what to do and you still had the dog and in the particular quest I was doing you got to put on a big chicken suit and I guess round up chickens and I was amused by the fact that you were in a chicken suit but yes otherwise I really didn't see anything that felt different to me than Fable 2
But, hold on, I do want to say, I mean, you make it sound like Fable 2 is a bad game, though.
I think a lot of people would be perfectly content if Fable 3 is just more Fable 2, because it was a great game.
I got bored with it after a while.
Okay, one of the coolest trailers I thought that they showed during the whole Microsoft press conference was for Metal Gear Solid Rising, where you can cut things pretty much wherever you want.
That was awesome.
Absolutely awesome.
I can get behind a game like that.
Poor Raiden and his metal jaw.
Other cool things, Reach, they were talking a little bit about some of the single player campaign.
They showed some footage from that.
It looks really epic and now they're going to have space dog fighting and stuff like that.
That'll be pretty cool.
It's going to be a great game, of course.
I don't know, other than that, I'm trying to think what else they really showed.
They didn't really talk too much about Xbox Live Arcade either, I don't think.
Well, there's a Summer of Arcade promo they're doing that has a lot of high-profile games, like the Hydro Thunder, I believe, is a part of that.
And the Hydrophobia, I think, is in there too, and the Castlevania game that we talked about a little earlier.
You know, that's back, and that's kind of where Arcade's going.
I was personally disappointed in the lack of Game Room news, and I think just further cements the fact that I think Microsoft's already written it off.
Um...
Yeah, I think that's about it.
Of course, the new Xbox looks kind of sexy and stuff.
All the rumors are true, of course.
Please, America, Europe, Japan, everybody out there listening to the show, Canada, stop calling it the Xbox 360 Slim.
It's not slim.
Have you seen it?
Have you seen it next to the old Xbox 360?
It's still fat.
That's like saying a guy who went from 300 pounds to 280 pounds is now skinny.
I mean, they're still fluffy.
And not that there's anything wrong with that, not that there's anything wrong with the new Xbox 360, but it is not slim enough.
Thanks for watching!
and then of course you know it has the integrated GPU CPU into one chip and the internal 250 gigabyte hard drive which I heard was actually you can interchange it like the PlayStation one but I'm not positive.
That's what I'm hearing too is that it's not as hardwired in there as the old drives were but here's the thing I don't think those systems are for the people who already own Xboxes.
Yeah it's for
It's to piss off those of us that just bought an Xbox a few months ago.
Thank you.
It's a push into the holiday season.
All it is is basically just an upgrade to the current stuff that they have out there.
You bet your ass they're going to do another fucking price drop in the fourth quarter.
You might as well just wait.
Seriously, they're going to do another price drop.
I think they've already said that they're going to be doing something new towards the holidays.
Just be patient.
All right.
So anything else you want to say about Microsoft or Microsoft-related stuff?
DarkSakura?
Booty shaking.
She's going to be picking up a Kinect to shake her booty.
That's fine.
All right.
How about Nintendo?
Let me give you my impression of Nintendo's press conference this year because, you know, Nintendo, everybody's expectations were very low for Nintendo.
You know, everybody was expecting something more on the 3DS, but I think other than that, everybody kind of went in there with their expectations low, but it basically went something like this.
Reggie Fils-Aimé comes out on stage.
Hi, I'm Reggie Fils-Aimé.
Prepare to have your minds fucking blown.
Here's the new Zelda game we've been talking about for a little while.
And now, here's a new Wii game, Kirby.
Here's a new Wii game, Goldeneye.
Who doesn't love Goldeneye?
Here's a new Wii game, Donkey Kong Country.
Here's a new Wii game... I mean, he's just naming game after game after game after game.
and then, oh, and by the way, the Wii is still selling well.
All those reports about the people are not buying games for the Wii are bullshit.
So don't you ever talk fucking bad about my system again.
Here comes Iwata to tell you about the 3DS.
That was basically what the press conference was.
And then they talk about the 3DS and it's real, y'all.
I mean, having seen the thing in person now, I can tell you it really does work.
It's a pretty impressive piece of technology.
Here's how I interpreted the press conference.
The Zelda game came out and they were showing off stuff.
Honestly, they should have just shown a trailer because I could care less watching him try to play the damn Zelda game.
And I do like the way it looks.
It's kind of a cross between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.
I like how it's very colorful.
It's got that kind of cel-shaded look to it, but it's still... It looks like cel-shaded watercolor.
That's my take on it.
It's more pastel-y and less like toilet water filter that the last game had.
Well, it looks like a Wii game and not like, oh look, it's a GameCube game.
Or even a Nintendo 64 game or something like that.
So that's cool.
The demonstration, though, they seriously needed to cut down that demonstration because it was not exciting.
It did go on a little long.
It was long.
But they know people are excited about Zelda, and that was one of the big things that everybody wanted to hear about.
But SSJ100Matt in our chatroom says, By the way, Reggie has gotten more and more chubby each E3.
He hasn't been playing his Wii Fit.
Dude, SSJ100Matt, I would be careful because Reggie will bring out some charts and fuck your shit up if you decide to...
I'm sorry, I don't buy his, oh, people haven't been playing the Wii, or people are playing the Wii and all that stuff.
Where's your data?
You coming out here and saying this, I don't buy it.
He cited MPD figures.
Yeah, MPD figures, they cover what games are selling.
And yeah, I'm sure a lot of people are buying Super Mario Galaxy and that kind of stuff, but every other game of other genres, like say some of the hardcore games and whatnot, those are not selling well.
And I can't say that the whole system is a success, but it's definitely certain genres are doing well and certain ones are not.
it's perhaps just because they don't have all I don't think they have the hardcore demographic they have kind of like the families playing the game and the people that are big Nintendo fanboys playing just the Nintendo products and that's about it um
I think a lot of folks in chat are wondering, because they know I'm a hardcore Kid Icarus fan from back in the day, what I was thinking when that Project Sora thing happened.
You can pretty much imagine it.
My jaw was on the floor.
And then as they were announcing it, I was like, oh my god, this makes perfect sense.
This is why they kept it such a big secret.
The whole Kid Icarus thing made perfect sense.
And it was really the defining moment of Nintendo's press conference for me, where I was like, oh my god, they're back.
Thank you.
Whoever hid Cammy under the rafters and whoever put the Wii Vitality Sensor somewhere far, far away, thank you so much.
Mario Sports is kind of dumb.
Played it.
It's a kid's game.
I wasn't a huge fan of it.
I did think Wii Party was better than a lot of people are passing it off as, though.
But the interesting thing is, my question is, if the 3DS is not coming out this holiday season, which I don't know, I kind of think it's not going to.
I think it is.
Well, I mean, and the one good reason I'm hearing for why it is coming out this holiday season, what else does Nintendo have?
Because we know Zelda got pushed back to 2011, so what are the big releases?
Goldeneye, that'll be a big title.
Kirby, I think.
Kirby, which was certainly worthy.
Epic Mickey, so they're putting a lot of stock in a third-party title, but it's a worthy title.
I did play a little bit of that, too.
It looks very good.
Wii Party, I think, will be one that they really back this holiday season.
for more short attention span folks
Kirby looked okay.
I never really have been a big fan of Kirby, but I definitely like the style of the game.
It's definitely unique.
There's nothing out there like it.
So that was kind of cool.
Wii Party, my mind turned off during the whole Wii Party thing.
I just don't care.
It's fine.
You play these little mini games, and what's funny is that one of them looks just like that rafting game they were showing in Microsoft's Adventures thing.
But it was funny.
We played this boat stacking game where you had to stack people on a boat and the size of the people was determined on how well you did in the minigame.
And Shane and I were getting competitive and we were cracking up when all the people were falling off the boat.
You know what's funny?
Metroid Other M just kind of had to be on the same level as all these other games.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I'm still really excited about that game.
But there was so much for Nintendo to show that this year Metroid wasn't able to stand out like it did last year.
Metroid Other M, and it's sad with the people I'm talking to, don't really seem to understand how awesome this game is going to be.
I think it looks really, really cool.
So it'll be interesting to see when that comes out.
The new Donkey Kong game.
I kind of like how they're going back to the old school stuff with that.
See, that's the thing.
Even with new Super Mario Bros., you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
Just put out a good game that's in that genre.
You don't even have to go all brand new with it.
Just a new game.
I played the new GoldenEye game.
It's a lot of fun.
I played this odd job and kept killing Shane with my hat.
It was a lot of fun.
Good times.
You threw a shoe?
Seriously?
Who throws a shoe?
It was fun.
It was fun.
I had a good time.
With Goldeneye.
Thank you for watching!
There was a stage that we were looking at during the demo where you get sent by one of the characters to collect masks.
And what you can do is you can go collect one mask, take it to him, and he'll say, okay, now get me two more.
And what you can do is you go around to the back of the shop, use your thinner to break down the door so you can just go into the back of the shop, take that same mask you just turned in, then go back to the front of the store and say, here's mask number two.
And he'll go, hmm, I don't remember them coming in a set, but okay, and he'll give you credit.
so you can play the game as kind of like good Mickey or bad Mickey which really surprised me that you'd be able to do that in a Mickey Mouse game you know what I mean like Mickey's supposed to be like now here's the thing heart of gold remember how they have like the concept art for epic Mickey and they have the really twisted creepy ass looking characters were any of them in there because it seems to me that they really like g-rated the whole damn thing it's not as like cool and epic as it was before
Um, yes and no.
I think a lot of that just wasn't in the demo they were showing on the show floor, but with the whole pate thinner angle and the fact that Mickey can be deceptive, I think it could be in there.
We just didn't see it at E3.
I wouldn't lose hope on that front yet, Loki.
As far as Nintendo goes, I do want to talk just a minute about the 3DS because I know a lot of people are really curious about what the system kind of feels like.
Don't expect things to fly out at you like in some of those commercials.
Imagine you're kind of like looking out this window or looking down a hallway that has depth that kind of goes in.
That's what the 3DS kind of looks like.
I don't know how they do the technology.
I don't know if it's functioning on prisms is what I hear.
No, it's basically they've got a different layer on there that directs light to both your eyes.
It's like, you know how interlaced TV works, how they have different lines that update every so often?
Well, imagine that but vertical and instead of it being updated differently, half of those lines are going to your right eye, half of those lines are going to your left eye.
That's crazy.
It's basically like... What do they call it?
Not a lithograph...
Lenticular.
Have you ever seen those boxes for Saw, for example, the 3D one?
Final Destination 3D.
That one that they had where you look at it and it looks like the stuff's kind of popping out because they've got basically this piece of plastic that has ridges on it that acts like a prism and pushes it to your left eye and right eye.
That's basically how it works.
They focus the image to two different eyes.
Cool.
It's like the Virtual Boy, but less headache-inducing.
Well, let me tell you, though.
The red migraine box?
The best thing... I noticed the pull on my eyes.
And I was kind of like, okay, this is not going to be a healthy thing for me to play for a couple hours.
Here's the best thing about it.
There's a slider that you can adjust the intensity of the 3D.
And if the 3D gets too gimmicky and too dumb for you, you just turn it off.
Presto Chango 2D.
One of the demos they were showing was Disney's Tangled, one of the movies.
I guess it's out in theaters.
They had a little trailer.
And that was some of the most impressive use of 3D they had.
I was not seeing artifacting or anything on the screen.
It was only the top screen.
Didn't really use the bottom screen at all.
But this will be great for kids.
Even some adults, too.
I don't think they're talking about a lot of adult movies on the 3D technology yet, but certainly the kid stuff, I think there's going to be a lot of people...
And of course, the developers list, which I'm not sure if we're getting into later, but lots of cool stuff.
All the big games, Mario Kart and stuff.
Wish they had a WarioWare game right there.
Still, if you go by the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
This thing has the games to back it up.
The cartridges are different from the regular DS.
The graphical power felt more like a PlayStation 2 in there.
Not quite at that level.
I don't think especially a lot of the rendering will be...
The Kingdom Hearts little demo I saw looked like the freaking game on the PS2.
A lot of it is going to be pretty impressive.
There's the games to back it up at the end of the day.
It's not like the PlayStation Move where I can't think of a single game I really want to buy the Move for.
And Kinect, I'm kind of teeter-tottering.
I'm like, well, I guess there's the two dance games.
Connect, I'm actually planning on picking up.
And I actually kind of want to pick up the Connect Adventures thing because I think that would be a fun party game.
The Dance Central stuff, I think that would be pretty fun.
The fitness game, I'm not sure because I bought Wii Fit.
I'm like, oh, I'm going to do that and stuff.
I need an excuse to work out.
But I don't know if I'd actually do that.
It's just like, games like that make me feel, like, awkward, you know what I mean?
Whereas, like, you can do, I mean, playing DDR, I guess, would be kind of awkward looking, too, but I never felt awkward playing the game, you know what I mean?
So, I don't know.
Alright.
Let's move on, I guess, then, to Sony, if we've kind of talked enough about the 3DS and so forth.
What did Sony do, Loki?
Okay.
Um, Sony had, of course, their, their big thing was, uh, they showed off the move stuff and 3D.
3D was the big thing for them.
Of course, they were talking about partners, um, with third comp, you know, third party companies for different 3D things.
Now it's a little deceptive in how they were talking about 3D because certain games like Crysis 2 will not only be 3D on the PlayStation platform, they will be 3D also on the Xbox 360 as well.
Not all games, though, I think, were going to be 3D, but as one of their big focuses, obviously the 3D Blu-ray is going to be available with a firmware update, which that is pretty cool because if you don't have that, you would have to actually buy a whole new Blu-ray player.
Also, they were showing off some new games, different franchises, like Twisted Metal was one of the big ones that they announced, which is kind of cool, Motorstorm Apocalypse, which I think looks pretty fun.
LittleBigPlanet 2 I got some hands on time with on the show floor and the level we were playing was a race level but it introduced the grappling hook and not only could you grapple on certain parts of the scenery but you could grapple the other players and that made it a lot of fun we had a lot of fun with that
Otherwise, stylistically, it really just looks like the first game, and graphically, but this upgrade is really more about the extra tools that are in it than anything else, which I think most people do.
I do like how you can have good control over everything, how you can make puzzle games and top-down action games or whatever, RPGs.
That's pretty cool.
So, it'll be interesting to see what levels are created by that, because I know I'm pretty creative, but I just don't have time to do it, so...
Thankfully, there's a community of millions of players out there to do it for me.
I don't know.
There wasn't a lot at Sony's press conference that really made me jump up and down and scream, except for Kevin Butler coming on stage.
That was awesome.
I know what makes me giddy.
What's that?
The P word.
The P word?
The second of the P words.
You lost me.
Portal 2.
Ah, Portal 2, of course.
How could we forget?
That was the big ending to Sony's press conference where Valve is basically saying...
Oh yeah, I guess we will make stuff for the PlayStation 3 after all.
That's basically what it was.
We'll stop ignoring you.
But I think even more so than just the fact that Portal 2 is coming out for the system is more the fact that Steam is going to have some integration with the PS3.
That was the biggest newsworthy thing to me.
Did you see the trailer for Portal 2?
I sure did.
You monster.
I know.
But now, I've watched, and we were actually able to, you know, we've got our TV out front with a computer hooked up to it so we can watch YouTube videos at the high res.
And we watched the playthrough demonstrations.
and that was really exciting but there was also an interview that G4 had up with one of the designers talking about the story that you know you didn't escape it's in the future the far future and you're still there oops and but it's gonna have they they said that there's gonna be they're actually in the playtesting part for both of the storylines and
I noticed that.
I thought that was pretty cool and makes sense for a game like Portal.
It would be very hard to integrate them both in the same game.
But by the way, just kind of in case it hasn't already been mentioned or you didn't hear, you know why that Portal 2 party got canceled after all?
It wasn't because Valve wanted to show something else out.
They were going to announce the PlayStation thing at that party.
But Sony came to them and said, you know, basically in so many words, actually, could you wait and come out on stage at our press conference?
That's why no Portal 2 event happened.
Okay.
Killzone 3 looked awesome, and I can only imagine what that looks like in 3D, so that was kind of cool.
The PlayStation Move stuff, I just couldn't get too excited about what they were showing.
I know it's going to have support for SOCOM 4 and stuff like that, and I know that they have a new Time Crisis game, which, by the way, never forget that they did come out with a gun con for the Time Crisis game.
What a waste of money that was.
Thank you, Namco.
Did you hear that in the Time Crisis game there's going to be a mode that's off-rails?
I'm like, that's not Time Crisis.
What do you mean it's off-rails?
They had that in the last one.
Did they really?
Yeah.
Oh, I didn't know that.
But see, the gun con in the last one was actually pretty cool because they did have, you know, the kind of a dual grip for it and they had, you know, one analog stick on your, you know, left hand where you'd be holding it at the front of the gun and the right analog...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
New Time Crisis Game, and whoop-dee-shit.
Where the hell did The Last Guardian go?
That was one of the big standouts from last year, and it just kind of disappeared, didn't it?
Yeah, they didn't mention anything, but it's supposed to be still coming out.
Hmm, I found that to be a little strange.
Maybe it was just me.
I was very disappointed.
It's still on my list for November.
Interesting.
I like how Gran Turismo 5 has a date again.
Let's see if they actually hit that date this time.
We'll see.
All right, so I guess we're done with press conferences.
Let's kind of go around and see what everybody's... Oh, you have something else you want to add?
No, I want to talk about some of the other smaller press conferences real quick.
Sure, sure.
Just make a quick mention.
Please do.
It wasn't really called a vitality sensor.
I forget what they were calling it, but it was like a breathing, relaxing game or something, which I thought was funny because I wonder if that, you know, you would think that they aren't actually coming out of the vitality sensor now since that thing basically is the vitality sensor and that, you know, Nintendo would be suing them if that were the case.
So that was interesting.
They showed a lot of games that weren't really games.
Like, they had a PC laser tag game, but all the PC did was basically keep score.
It was actually, you know, a real laser tag, like, pack and crap that you bought and put on and went and shot your friends and stuff like that.
And Joel McHale looked really awkward hosting the Ubisoft thing.
The new Rayman game looks awesome.
Have you seen that?
The episodic one?
Mm-hmm.
It's all really pretty hand-drawn and just really awesome.
And then the last one that they showed, which also was kind of weird, and it was funny because they were saying it wasn't really a game.
was Mania Planet which I'm kind of a fan of the Track Mania series but they're going to be having two new PC titles that you're going to be able to make your own custom games out of Shoot Mania which is going to be like a first person shooter kind of editor creator type thing and RPG Mania which you'll be able to make your own RPG type games and of course a new Track Mania game that's going to be coming out which looks very pretty so those are pretty cool
That's pretty much it for right now.
Alright.
Let's go around.
I just kind of want to get everybody's thoughts on the, you know, in your opinion, the best thing about E3 and the worst thing about E3.
I'll start.
The best thing about E3 was by far the 3DS.
I mean, just actually getting to see it and use it and behold this new piece of technology was really something else.
Even if the lines the first day were pretty ugly, but they got a little more manageable as the show went on.
So I would say the best thing was by far 3DS.
Worst thing about E3 was flaky flakes like Activision and Blizzard, you know, being under the same umbrella, just deciding they don't even need a booth anymore.
I realize they had their own off event.
I realize they think they're at a level where they can just not put up with the show of E3, but I just, I don't know, it's kind of...
I get... Sounds tacky.
It's a little tacky to me.
I mean, they're kind of reeking of that kid who takes the ball and goes home because they don't like the rules of the game.
You know, it's just... It's unfortunate, I think.
And just the fact that Blizzard will not show anything at E3 because basically they can charge people $150 who will go see it at their own convention and then the tickets get scalped on eBay so basically people are really paying like $400.
to go see these demos of games they're going to end up buying regardless anyway.
Personally, I think BlizzCon's a big fat joke, but I guess I'll save that rant for another edition of OLR.
Anyhow, best and worst of E3.
Loki.
I kind of have to agree with the Activision thing, just because I wish there was more coverage of the Activision games.
To me, and you were mentioning BlizzCon and stuff, a lot of the stuff that Activision does seems like a cash grab, and believe me...
If they had thought about the whole charging people for online play when you buy a used game first, they would have been doing it first.
And I have a feeling they're going to be falling suit with that because they can make a lot of money off those Call of Duty games, Black Ops and whatnot.
Speaking of which, Black Ops looked fucking awesome.
Or no, it wasn't Black Ops.
Future Warrior, actually.
They were showing off the new Ghost Recon game looked awesome in the Ubisoft thing.
I mean...
Really cool.
One of the best moments of E3, I think, was when Kevin Butler came on stage and did his little rant.
That was actually really cool.
Completely scripted, well-acted rant.
I don't care.
He's a great actor.
He's funny.
I have no problems with... I understand he's not a real... He's a real person, but he's playing this character, and that's fine.
I think it's a great advertising ploy.
So that was really cool.
You know what's funny?
I was talking to Bobby about this one of the nights, and Shane was probably there too, and we were talking about this.
Many years ago here on the show, maybe a couple years ago, I kind of said one of the problems Sony's having right now is that they don't really have a good voice.
Xbox 360 has Major Nelson, Nintendo has Reggie Fils-Aimé, but who does Sony have?
Sony has not really had a spokesperson.
But they sure do now, don't they?
My how a lot has changed in a year.
It seems to me like the Stephen Colbert of the video game world.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
I need to retract my Activision thing.
Activision was not the worst part.
And sadly enough, it does tie in with Kevin Butler.
Who the fuck is this new kid pimping out the PSP stuff?
He is so fucking annoying.
Why would you even have someone else handling that when you have Kevin Butler?
It's like, hey, look, we have this fine caviar, but instead we're going to serve you dog shit on a plate.
I mean, why would you do that?
Why would you?
You're going backwards.
You took a big step backwards with this kid.
At the end of the day, they still eat crayons.
Kevin Butler or not, remember that.
Sony's still eating crayons.
I understand, but seriously, what the hell?
Rob, you gotta admit, the kid wears the bicycle helmet.
And then they played like two commercials with him in it.
I'm like, stop.
I already hate him already.
Enough to be redundant.
SSJ100 Matt in our chat room.
Exactly right.
Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com says, Seriously, think of the games they could have shown instead of Kevin Butler's rant.
But it was an epic time-killing moment.
Toa Gak believes that dog shit is actually better than caviar.
Alright, fine.
We can serve you filet mignon wrapped in bacon in the most delicious food you could possibly ever have or a steaming pile of dog shit.
In fact, we'll just put the dog over your face and he can shit straight into your mouth.
So it's absolutely fresh.
Loki, we get it.
God.
I don't think you do.
Well, I'm done with that.
This dog has been constipated forever.
Don't make me bring out the Dalek.
DarkSakura, please.
The best thing about E3 for you and the worst thing about E3 for you.
It's a combination of getting my little bit of Portal 2 crack.
Because you know I've been waiting for that.
Did they say anything about Half-Life 3?
That's what I wanted to ask.
You're funny.
Valve acknowledging Half-Life.
That's funny.
No, they didn't.
Anyway.
and the other good thing would be Kid Icarus with the 3DS so yay and the worst thing is there was no me there that was pretty awful so I couldn't have my epic running into Kojima but he wasn't there anyway that's why you couldn't go it's a constant in the universe that every E3 that I go to I have to run into Kojima literally
and you know what else is kind of dumb not quite the worst thing of E3 what are they doing with the PSP oh look we have a new God of War game props to you, new God of War game awesome they're still trying to kind of recover from that whole PSP go debacle I think Sony's going to save that PSP 2 for next year guaranteed there'll be a PSP 2 next year
They're gonna have to.
Alright.
They can't lose by much more.
How about some release dates?
Because meanwhile, while expos are going on, there's still games coming to a store near you, and we probably should acknowledge some of the upcoming releases!
Yes, this week there's going to be some Transformers.
The Cybertron Wars will be coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and of course two versions on the DS because they have to have one for every faction and one on the PSP, one on the PC.
Way too many Transformers, but that's fine.
Also this week, crappy DS games including Western Riding Academy Awesome, because there's no horse riding games on the DS at all TNA Cross the Line, that's going to be coming out on PSP and DS this week Just Sing, it's a karaoke game for the DS that comes with a microphone That plugs into your DS so you can look like a tool on the subway
10-Minute Solutions coming from Activision.
It's their fitness game based off a DVD exercise series.
Wipeout based off the, I guess it's a popular TV show on DS and Wii.
Thank you, Activision.
Why can't they just have Takashi's Castle the game?
I know they did way back in the day, but a new one.
That would be kind of cool.
Ah, the Wii.
What junk you have.
Calvin Tucker's Redneck Racing on the Wii from Zoo Games.
Thank you very much.
And some generic brain training games.
Think Smart on DS.
And then they also have Think Smart Kids on DS.
And then that's also on the Wii.
Okay.
Let's see here.
A couple more.
Field and Stream Total Outdoorsman Challenge on the Xbox 360.
Puzzle Quest 2 on the DS.
That's going to be the old school Puzzle Quest game.
None of this crappy hexagon space Puzzle Quest crap.
Play that at the show.
It has a lot of new mini games too.
Yes.
And then finally, an actual game from Nintendo and kind of a cult classic, or soon to be a cult classic, Sin and Punishment Star Successor, coming out this week.
Get it now before it's gone.
Yeah.
So, that's it.
If you want Nintendo to put out more titles like that, you might want to get it now.
Although it does look like Nintendo's got a lot of, I guess you could say, hardcore quote-unquote games coming out for the rest of the year.
Monster Hunter Frontier Online Online Adventure
I would probably stop short of saying MMO, but you're going to have 11 different types of weapons and you'll be able to use the Xbox 360 live basically to go into a plaza, chat with other hunters for tips.
Capcom's going to be regularly updating the game, so keep an eye on that one.
I bet if anybody's importing a game, that would be one of them.
Sengoku Hime 2 is also coming out this week from System Soft, a little strategy game there featuring anime characters, as a lot of the games in Japan end up being.
There's also, by the way, a special new keyboard coming out for the Xbox 360 Monster Hunter game, so keep a lookout for that.
In other Japanese release dates, there are some games coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well.
There's a game called White Album.
Suzurariyu Fuyu no Omoide is coming out, and this is an adventure game.
Basically, your idol is your girlfriend, and the more popular she becomes, the less time she has for you.
Tottorino Atelier
Arland No Rekonjushushi 2 it comes out this is a sequel to Rorona No Etler it takes place 10 years after that it's an RPG you have you know synthesis and go on swashbuckling adventures etc etc it's a JRPG at its finest
Going over to the Nintendo Wii, SD Gundam Gashapon Wars comes out this week.
Oh, I love SD Gundam.
They're so cute.
There's also a version coming out with a classic controller, it should be stated.
So check that out.
By the way, Goldeneye, I played completely on a classic controller.
That's how they were demoing it.
I meant to get that out at some point.
You don't have to use motion control at all in Goldeneye.
The way it should be.
on the Nintendo DS this week in Japan Love Plus comes out this week and there's like all these little play stands and things coming out to support it but that's what it's called it's called Love Plus it's like a experience school and you go on vacations and mountain climbing with three girls and you date it's another dating sim okay guys
It's basically a sequel to the one where the guy married the character.
Yes, it is.
It is that same series.
Also, if that's not enough for you, Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side, third story.
So if Love Plus is not for you, maybe you want to play the Girl's Side.
You know what the Girl's Side ones are, right?
It's basically where you are now the female lead and you're trying to get a boyfriend before graduation.
So I like that, that they're both coming out the same week.
You know, Rob, I have a Laserdisc of Tokimeki Memorial OEV.
Really?
Yeah, and I bought it because it had a big Konami logo on it.
Fun.
That really pretty much does it for release dates.
I'm looking at the Sony PSP.
I guess I should say Hatsune Miku Project Diva is coming out this week.
I think this has been covered on a previous show.
It is a rhythm game.
There's a number of people in the chat room who have been all kinds of hyper about getting it too.
It's the Vocaloid.
It's the Sega Rhythm Game, so I bet there's some people... Oh, you know what it is?
I'm sorry.
It's a price reduction.
It's not the initial release.
But you know who Hatsune Miku is?
The Vocaloid.
Remember sending you all those videos of the electronic girl voice singing?
Yeah, I do.
That's her.
Chaos Head Noah is the last game I'm going to mention this week, also on the PSP.
That's an adventure game that's coming out there on the PSP in Japan.
Alright, DarkSakura, how about the Old Kingdom?
Well, um, eh.
That's my official answer.
No, um, we've got a number of things.
On the 23rd, we have Land Bandit and Puzzle Quest 2.
Excuse me.
And on the 25th, we have Armada 2526, Backbreaker, Demon's Souls, Lego Harry Potter Years 1 through 4, Naughty Bear.
That just sounds like a bedroom nickname.
Someone's been a Naughty Bear.
Oh, my Naughty Bear.
Singularity, Transformers War for Cybertron, and that is it for this week.
All right.
That's going to do it for release dates for right now.
What's that?
Are you a naughty bear?
I'm a very naughty bear.
YYR in our chatroom, I love this, talking about Love Plus, although Alpha Cananigram is saying it's Love Plus Plus.
Hey, I just read it like it was written, okay?
YYR says, I'll be waiting for the depressing sequel, Love Minus.
It takes place after all the girls dump the main character's sorry ass.
There you go, that's the real game right there.
Chat.OrangeSoundsRadio.com if you want to join in the fun.
It's such a weird game.
At least you don't poke witches in it.
So E3, of course, was pretty big.
And there was 45,600 attendees.
And next year, you can expect E3 to be coming out slightly earlier.
June 7th through the 9th, it will be also at the LA Convention Center.
And of course, they're expecting probably an even bigger turnout for that as well.
alrighty 300 exhibitors this year as well you know what though the show's starting to get a little big like I that was oddly worded the way I said but I mean I don't want it to get as big as it was in 2006 especially when Kensha Hall is now a parking lot which is what they use Kensha Hall for now by the way just so you know it's a parking lot?
yes it's a parking lot people park their cars in there in the hall?
in the hall when did that get dirty?
I think the floor is probably removable they can do that now
I'm not kidding when I went down there to use the bathroom at one point I looked in the doors there's all these cars parked in there I don't know if it was the exhibitors or what but that's what they use Kensho Hall for now weird well you know what this is a good story for us to kind of sort of end on here on this part A and that is that you know the news doesn't stop just because E3 is over and apparently Hideo Kojima is and they were saying he was at E3 this week showing off Metal Gear Solid Rising but at the press conference
Yeah, apparently he is sitting on a massive PS3 exclusive that was not ready to show at E3.
They're going to show it at Tokyo Game Show.
So don't forget, the news does not end at E3.
There are still other expos that people are going to show their big news.
This is coming from a CVG computer and video game source that apparently there is a PlayStation 3 exclusive that is supposed to, quote, own the show in Tokyo.
They really wanted to have it ready for E3, but it unfortunately just was not ready.
And maybe they didn't want to steal the thunder from Metal Gear Solid Rising anyway.
No idea what it could be.
Could it be an existing Kojima series like Bokutai?
Probably not.
Zone of the Enders?
I somehow doubt that too.
Yeah, I think this is probably going to be a whole new thing.
Or maybe another just Metal Gear Solid game.
Nah, probably not that.
I think it'll be an all new Kojima game.
Metal Gear Solid Move Party.
Snake Party.
Oh wait, that sounds bad.
Alright, well we can't end Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio without doing a segment we love here at Orange Lounge Radio.
The classic game of the week.
Yes, this is a game that I love.
Sylphia
Sylphia.
Yeah, and I had to go to different sources to find more information about it because I haven't played the game for a little while myself.
But it's a fun, fun little shooter.
It's a 2D shooter set in mythological Greece.
You have a ton of extra lives and you get a special attack called the Giga Fairy Beam.
Fairy Beam?
Yes, because you play as a fairy.
You're a fairy.
It's not really one of the greatest games because it's really not super challenging, but it's just really, really nice.
You start off with this woman warrior who dies protecting Athena's temple, and so she turns into a Sylphia.
Yeah.
So, um, she can go and, uh, you know, basically stop all the people who, uh, who, uh, you know, tried to hurt all of them.
So, that's sort of the main story.
Anyway, you fly around and you get power-ups, and, um, your power-ups are bee icons, and, um, you have, like,
Thank you for watching!
But it really goes for things from pretty much Greek mythology.
You have a flying chariot that's pulled by manticores.
It's pretty fun, pretty flight of fancy sort of game.
And it is put out by Compile, and Compile has brought out a lot of good games.
And there's your reason right there to play it, honestly.
It's the people who did the Guardian Legend, need I say more.
Yeah.
But it's pricey to try to find a copy of it now.
It really is.
I have a copy.
It goes for about $100 average on eBay.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Yeah.
Look at that.
Some type of golem, I think.
Skimpy little bra.
Perverts.
But too bad about that Medusa head.
Yeah.
Alright, there it is.
And that's the one thing I also wanted to point out too, is that your attack can go directional based on proximity.
Very cool.
So it makes fighting the bosses a little bit more dynamic than your average 2D shooter.
Your classic game of the week for the PC Engine, a compile classic, Sylphia is the classic game of the week.
A game so crazy rare, DarkSakura had to really scour the web to find more information on it.
All right, that's going to do it for your classic video game of the week.
We have plenty more to come here at Orange Lounge Radio.
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live with our 371st episode on this June the 20th of 2010 where we are taping live, of course, as we do every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
Speaking of All Games, amongst all the E3 madness, I nearly neglected to mention this and I definitely wanted to mention this at some point tonight.
But this has been kind of building for a couple weeks here, and that is the Big Battle, which is a competition between several of the shows on the All Games Network.
It is not the hosts, it's the listeners that actually are going to be doing some of the competing in these games.
And there's still more games to be announced.
Think of it as like a gaming Olympics, and you can get all the information at thebigbattle.net.
Thank you for watching!
on there right now.
And I don't think we can really rest until we're the largest team being represented in the big battle.
But then we actually have to win some of the competitions too.
And really wrapping up soon, Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Soldner X2.
Both of those battles wrapping up very soon.
I believe there's going to be a live Battlefield competition on the 26th.
And then Soldner X2 is basically get the highest score you can in the next week.
But I will say some new competitions were added because we got a lot of Twitter feedback
When we first announced the big battle, like, well, where are the games that I own?
I don't own those games.
Well, remember, guys, it's like the Olympics.
There's going to be more and more games that are added as this event goes on.
And some of the new games that were added, Pinball.
That's right, Zen Pinball and Pinball FX.
So you can play the Earth Defense Force Table for high score in Zen Pinball, or you can play Pinball FX, the Buccaneer Table on the 360.
Both those events end on July 9th, and more information is available on thebigbattle.net.
And it's just high score.
Thank you for watching!
So check that out again.
One more time, TheBigBattle.net and we'll bring you the results for Soldner X2 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 hopefully for next week's show.
Hopefully the folks behind the All Games Radio Big Battle will be able to get those results to me soon.
Moving on with show stuff, we're going to do some rapid fire news here in part B and then get to the Twitter topics.
So if you still need to get your Twitter topics in, you have just a few more minutes.
All right, Loki, why don't you start us off with some of the stuff that may be amiss at E3 amongst all these 3DSs and Valve on PlayStation and all this other stuff that was going on.
this is kind of neat Secret of Mana is coming to the iPhone later this year basically going to be a port of the SNES game and they didn't really say when exactly it's going to be ported over but sometime in 2010 so keep on looking out for that one also by the way just because I noticed it's not mentioned here Final Fantasy Tactics is also in that same boat very cool
Another game coming to the iPhone is Bit.Trip.Beat.
That's going to be coming out as well.
No word on exactly when that is, but it is coming out soon.
That's kind of cool.
They're going to use the tilt controls to move the paddle just like the Wii version.
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is getting an arcade game.
It's going to be exclusive on the PlayStation Network for a certain period of time.
It will be coming out August 10th.
Of course, this game looks absolutely amazing.
Really, I don't understand why people before when I was posting that we should do...
What was it?
Remember we had that list list or whatever for the versus games and I picked a really obscure reference of the guy that did the, you know, king of 9 billion percent or whatever.
Yes.
Yes.
I do remember that.
Yes.
That was many weeks ago.
That's the guy that animated this game.
Oh wow, okay.
And it looks freaking awesome.
Alright.
I don't remember the guy's name, but I'm sure the chat room will figure that out.
But it looks awesome.
Like, I actually think about, I may pick this up on the PlayStation Network.
Maybe.
If I have the patience, I guess I could wait, but it looks so cool.
Who did that?
I'm trying to remember now.
Uh...
I don't remember.
I'll look it up and chime in later.
And then, let's see here.
Last thing, rock band stuff coming out this week because, yes, unlike certain other music game platforms, they actually do have stuff that comes out every single week.
Not always good though.
This week we will be getting the Miley Cyrus pack.
Number one, which means I guess there's going to be more than one later on.
Included in that will be a few Miley Cyrus tracks including Seven Things, Can't Be Tamed, Fly on the Wall, See You Again, and Start All Over.
Those are each available for $2 or the equivalent in your fictional points.
and the whole pack will be available for 680 Microsoft points.
I have no idea what that translates to in real world money but I can guarantee it's going to be slightly cheaper than buying them all separate if you're really going to buy them all separate or if you were even going to buy them at all.
Those will be available June 22nd.
I thought the listeners would appreciate a little taste of Miley Cyrus there.
She's more talented than her dad.
Because I'm built like that.
Really?
I have a funny story about this.
Can I tell it real quick?
Tell.
I was admiring the wall of songs that they had at the Harmonix booth, and one of the gals that worked for Harmonix kind of caught me looking at it and said, yeah, it's an impressive list, huh?
And I said, you know, it could really use some more Lady Gaga.
You know, I was just kind of joking, right?
And she said, well, you better stay tuned for next week.
She says, there won't be Lady Gaga.
I can't tell you who it is yet, but there's definitely a lady coming to XY.
She was talking about Miley Cyrus.
I kind of want to go back and find her and say that's not what I meant.
Or you want to punch her in the face?
No, she was nice.
I don't want to punch her in the face, but I just want to set her straight that Miley Cyrus is not, not, not the same as Lady Gaga.
Thank you.
And the person that I was looking for that did the Scott Pilgrim game, Paul Robertson.
He's the guy doing the sprites, and that guy can animate like nothing else.
It is one sexy-looking game.
And if that's not cool enough, apparently there's a chiptune rock band, Anamanaguchi, that's going to be providing the soundtrack for the game.
So...
Seriously, pick it up.
If you have to wait for it to come out on Xbox Live, then fine.
By the way, can I read some of the chatroom comments here?
Toagak says, fucking shit, Sky, turn it off.
TheDr945 says, my achy, breaky ears.
Shadowrunner says, Sky, you just blew out my eardrum with that god-awful music.
Thanks, JK, lols.
There you go.
So our chatroom, always appreciative of the antics here at Orange Lounge Radio.
chat.orangelandsradio.com if you want to yell at me for playing certain songs on the air going over to some other quick news this might have been the game of the show for Loki had he gone Hello Kitty Seasons is coming to the Wii that's right finally Hello Kitty is getting a Wii game I believe she had a GameCube game but now she's getting a Wii game Hello Kitty Seasons will be on the Wii this holiday I don't really know what it's about I think it's a puzzle game but does anybody really fucking care
I know Loki cares, but I'll send him the link so he can read it offline.
Hey, I bought Kitty the Cool so you could play it.
By the way...
If you were thinking of picking one of these up, not Hello Kitty, but a Microsoft racing wheel, you might want to get that now, because Mad Catz is saying that Microsoft will no longer be having them produce this.
They really had to kind of carefully say this, but they were saying, you're going to have to check with Microsoft for further information.
But it's Mad Catz understanding that Microsoft is exiting the wheel market.
That was from Mad Catz's PR manager, and obviously...
I can see why.
With Natal, Kinect, whatever you want to call it coming out soon.
I bought one of those to use with my arcade cabinet actually because I have one of those wireless adapters for the 360 controllers and I love my 360 controller for PC games like I use it with Crysis and I use it with Grand Theft Auto on there.
I haven't tried the racing wheel yet with any actual games but
I can't wait to use it for like, you know, driving games on MAME.
It's Grotius with boobies And it's a sequel to the Grotius boobie game that was on the Japanese 360 No, Otomedia's Gorgeous
Gorgeous was the original.
Excellence is the sequel.
Whatever.
Boobs and Gradius.
That's what they should just call the game.
Boobs and Gradius.
Gratuitous Boobius.
Our friends, buddy pals at BomaniStyle.com had actually a little interview with Naoki Madea at E3 asking about some of the hard questions about what the hell happened to DDR.
and DarkSakura.
So some of the other things that had come up was they called out the direct comparison to the Power of Hard Ice series and Loki said, yes, I did some work on that, but my team is no longer a part of Bomani.
So Dance Masters is not a Bomani game.
That's something important to point out.
They also said we have professional dancers and choreographers from all over the world creating routines for Dance Masters.
So I'm hoping with that in mind that they are actually doing different styles of dance and
and it's not just the Paras stuff that perhaps the Paras stuff was able to be finished first because you know maybe they either have the motion capture data for it or they already have routines down for that kind of stuff I'm hoping I also thought this was interesting and I really hope Naoki means this when he says this he was asked a question by MamadiStyle about given that you've worked on all these different types of games do you think that peripheral based games have a strong future in America?
And he says, Okay, at Konami we did Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, 2DX, DDR, and these games created the atmosphere of playing an instrument or dancing.
And then in America, Rock Band, DJ Hero, Guitar Hero made it feel more real while still being a game.
We are trying to create an even more real experience while still being the most fun possible, so we would like to be flexible.
Here's the part I think you should pay special attention to.
Hmm.
Which I think is a good idea.
I think that's a great idea, so we'll see if it actually pans out.
Arguably, the game, you know, DDR, some of the best music in DDR was the music coming from Konami.
So it makes sense.
Alright, how about some Twitter topics, you guys?
Shall we go to Twitter and see what the listeners are showing us on their tweets?
By the way, if you want to show us your tweets, all you have to do is follow OLR on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
And you can send us our tweets.
We always say, hey, you guys have a few minutes to get those topics in for whatever you want to talk about.
Keep in mind, I'm not going to read every tweet we get because sometimes you guys link to stories that are going to come up a little later in the show.
So it's not because I don't like you, I promise.
Uh, let's see.
Um, I thought this was an interesting link here from Tigerclaw305 on Twitter sending us this.
Sony downplays the 3DS.
Because, you know, Sony was trying to show a lot of 3D at their conference, too, and then Nintendo just kind of came out and said, well, you don't need glasses for ours.
Haha.
So here it is.
Sony kind of downplayed this a little bit.
Kaz Hirai specifically.
He said, Here's the problem, Mr. Hirai.
They've got the games to back it up.
Whereas,
I don't know, I guess I should say some of the games that sound like they're pretty awesome on the Sony 3D experience sound pretty cool, but the move I'm a little less excited about.
It's just that they, I mean, when they come up with questions like that, what's he going to say?
That's amazing, wish we had thought of that.
He's obviously going to try to put something... Microsoft and Nintendo, up until Kinect was announced, was kind of trading these little hearts for each other.
They used to kind of compliment each other until Microsoft decided they were not going to have any of this competition anymore and go right after it.
DarkTetsuya links us to a story where apparently Reggie has said, you know, maybe young kids should probably not play the 3DS.
But he actually means very young children.
We recommend that very young children not look at the 3D images.
That's because in young children, the muscles for the eyes are not fully formed.
This is the same messaging that the industry is putting out with 3D movies, so it is a standard protocol.
We have the same type of messaging for the virtual boy as an example.
Nintendo made my baby cross-eyed.
Seven years or older, according to Reggie Fils-Aimé.
Again, I think the disclaimers on this thing are going to be a mile long.
Alpha Cananogram is saying, Child of Eden 3DS.
Good idea.
Am I right?
I mean, it would look cool on 3DS.
It's from Alpha Cananogram.
It'd be a little... That might be too much going on.
That might be too much for the eyes.
They could do it, but it would be a little tough.
I think something that's more wireframe, like Rez, would lend itself a little easier to the 3D stuff than maybe Child of Eden.
I would like to see a Rez 3D port.
You know, something we didn't talk a lot about, but there's... I apologize if I'm mentioning a story that's coming up, but there's hella, hella ports everywhere.
being planned for the DS.
Like, you know, if you think it was bad, all the stuff that's coming out now, man, they want to go back and do all these games.
One of the games I played on the 3DS was the old shooter, old shooter by Namco, Xevious.
Dude, that's a great game.
And it was 3D.
That's fantastic.
And there's all these other old school 3D games they're going to go back and do.
You probably heard about Ocarina of Time.
And I guess there's this list somewhere that details all these games that Nintendo wants to do in 3D.
So...
Those are actually not games that they want to do.
They're in development already.
Jeez.
What?
My brain just did something weird.
It combined Ocarina of Time with Weird Al doing the soundtrack.
What?
The Pokerina of Time.
That'd be the greatest thing ever.
You are so strange.
I had to share that.
It just popped into my head.
Seriously?
Weird Al game?
Where is it?
There has not been a Weird Al game.
Gallagher had a video game.
That is just blasphemy that there has been no Weird Al video game.
And also I want to say I am also very disappointed with TV being the way it is nowadays.
We should really seriously have our own UHF channel by now.
Ray Ayanami... Oops, sorry, that was a retweet, not a question.
Richard Zard says, I'm very upset I cannot meet up with you at E3.
I tried to meet up with you at E3, but that didn't go so well.
I was really looking forward to meeting you after three years of listening.
Well, unfortunately, E3 is probably the worst possible place to do a meetup because there's so much going on at E3.
Unfortunately, it doesn't lend itself as well to meetups as things like PAX and so forth.
We were just...
There's just too much going on.
But honestly, I didn't know there was an interest beforehand for folks to kind of want to meet up.
I didn't think enough of our listeners really went to the show.
But now that I know there are some, I guess next year, maybe we'll plan like a dinner one night or something we could probably do.
But just on the show floor is just really like the worst possible place to have, you know,
OLR Reunions, and so forth.
STO100Matt is asking us, out of all the E3s you guys slash gal have gone to, which is your fave, worst, and where does this one stack up to those?
Easy.
My favorite was my first one because you never forget your first.
Carameldansen
My least favorite year was 2006.
The year right before the break.
Because that was the year where Paris Hilton had a line going around.
There was just too damn many people at E3.
And it kind of became a little bit of a joke.
And then this year would be my second favorite E3.
I felt that I just... I got to do so much this year that I hadn't done in years past.
And I was keeping myself so busy with stuff that I was very pleased with the show this year.
And I think there was just a lot of good tech to see.
Because I don't think last year's show was very good either.
That would probably be my second least favorite show next to the 06 show.
So I would rank them 04, 10, 05, 09, 06.
Well, I can't really rank any of mine.
I mean, there's good experiences and bad experiences.
And not all of them I link with the convention itself.
So I would say...
I think that I really did like 2006 just because I got in a ton of awesome interviews that year.
And the year before that was pretty cool too because I piggybacked on my friend's press pass.
And the year before that was great because it was my first E3.
and I got in.
I'd actually have to say though that my favorite experience of all the E3s was meeting Koji Kondo and getting it.
I found the little book with his autograph and that was just fantastic for me.
Of course, Dan, his highlight is, well, the picture that's up there of him meeting Yu Suzuki.
I know that other than that though I did have a really massive migraine and having aching feet was kind of suck and Paris Hilton sucked but you know what was actually cool was meeting the Harlem Globetrotters oh cool and they were doing that charity thing so that was pretty cool
Takeo Rei sends us a message on Twitter.
Have you seen the Penny Arcade comic about the E3 press conferences?
Pretty accurate retelling.
Oh, God, yes, I did see that, and it was great.
I laughed so hard.
Somebody actually sent that to me on my phone while I was at E3, and I love the Reggie Fils-Aimé in the middle panel.
New Zelda, new Goldeneye, new Kirby, new Metroid, new Kid Icarus, new 3D shit, no glasses.
Santa Claus is real.
He's in our booth, and he's giving out fucking hand jogs.
Nintendo bitches, we out.
That's a great retelling of what actually happened.
That's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
Twitter.com slash OLR.
Thank you guys who submitted topics tonight.
How about some more news?
Loki, what you got for us?
All right.
Well, let's see.
There's some stuff I kind of talked about a little bit earlier.
Ubisoft, they had a lot of things that were announced during their press conference that kind of had people scratching their head because they weren't really video games, perhaps.
I mean, they were sort of...
and DarkSakura.
They're going to be having a beta coming out for that.
You can test it out on this fourth quarter of this year.
Shootmania, which is going to be the new kind of first person shooter type of game that you'll be able to create custom levels for.
They're going to have a beta for that sometime the first quarter of 2011.
And finally, Questmania, which is going to be kind of like their RPG maker type of game.
That will be available for beta at some point.
They haven't really said when.
DarkSakura,
BattleTag is a game that is basically laser tag.
You've got a vest and these pistols that you run around with and these different targets that you can use for checkpoints or whatever.
You can create your own games out of it.
and it ties in with your PC which is kind of the scorekeeper, kind of like the game master for the stuff.
And so they announced that.
It's kind of neat.
It's something you would probably see at like Kensha Hall if there was a Kensha Hall anymore.
But that's something else coming out later this year on PC.
Not really like a game per se that you can't like just play like a first person shooter game with it on your PC.
It's actually just something that uses your PC for like scoring which is interesting.
and then the game that was pretty much the Wii Vitality Sensor but not, Energy.
And apparently Energy was a game that had a sensor that you would put on your finger or penis because you know that's going to happen and you would use this to kind of relax.
They had a breathing exercise that you could do.
They made Joel McHale do that because he was hosting the whole event.
and, um, it's interesting, I guess.
I don't know.
It's supposed to make you feel good.
Make you feel real good.
Which I guess putting your penis in the sensor might do that.
I don't know.
And that's why Santa Claus is at E3.
I did post that.
I'm like, well, energy, what are they thinking?
Time to penis is what?
Vatra Shattered Memories, Silent Hill Homecoming
also missing from this Silent Hill and this is huge Akira Yamaoka is not going to be a part of the new Silent Hill game so this means the new replacement will be Daniel Licht he does the theme song for Dexter the TV show and he also has done Hellraiser and Children of the Corn so I guess that's kind of cool sadly it's going to be not the same without Akira Yamaoka but at the same time I'm looking forward to seeing what Silent Hill and New People's Hands is going to be
by the way the story if you haven't seen the trailer yet it's about a prison inmate in the transport vehicle basically overturned or something and now he's in the fog of Silent Hill which I noticed looked a lot like the movie so I guess they're incorporating the movie into the canon or something I don't know so
they are talking about evolving the combat in a different direction as opposed to doing one or the other from the previous games so I don't know DarkSakura I know you're a big Silent Hill fan are you are you hopeful about the new Silent Hill game are you kind of like oh too much has changed this isn't gonna be Silent Hill anymore I'd really have to see I'm gonna reserve judgment
Fallout New Vegas Trailer
Everything at Bethesda was appointment only, and I didn't see that trailer online, no, because I haven't even played Fallout 3.
Well, the trailer was online, and it was great.
Cool.
Yeah.
It was pretty funny, actually.
Bobby was telling me it was very neon in there.
Yeah, well, Fallout Online is actually starting to solicit for betas, for their open beta.
So, if you go to the Fallout Online website, you should, actually I filled out the little form, it's just like a little form, you sign up for their mailing list and they'll send you information on the beta.
Eventually.
But Interplay had some legal issues for a while, but now it finally seems like it's going forward, so let's hope so.
I could deal with some post-apocalyptic killing of people.
Too many MMOs.
So many.
I'm still stuck on Star Trek Online.
Nothing's going to get me off of that.
I know you are.
But it doesn't mean I cannot flirt a little bit.
I'm not in a serious, committed relationship.
I have an open relationship with Star Trek Online.
You can look, but you just can't touch.
I can touch all I want to.
I'm trusted.
I'll always come back.
Alright, let's go to one more news story and then we got the mailbag coming at you.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com One of the things that was shown off during the Konami press conference is of course Def Jam Rapstar.
What's kind of interesting though is they're going to have this whole online aspect.
A lot of community features, different taunts and stuff like you can do rap battles or whatever and actually record different things and
Have a community.
I guess there's going to be Def Jam talent scouts and stuff like that.
Keeping an eye on the good rap star players and whatnot.
I don't know, it's a lot of community stuff, which is really cool You know what's interesting is that Def Jam Rapstar actually looks like a really solid game It's a bummer that I'm not as interested in the content there, you know, I can't rap, please But it actually, you know, just kind of looking at it and watching other people playing it and then hearing about all this community stuff I was kind of like, why can't some of the other music games...
Take a page from this.
Konami, seriously, you have this framework built for Rapstar.
Just now make it into a singing game and call it Karaoke Revolution.
Or you put this next to the Glee game that they were also showing off and the Glee game looks pathetic.
Absolutely pathetic.
The Glee game is just a simple try to grab at the market for the Glee stuff because those damn Glee albums are at the top of the charts.
Great, we have people covering songs and it's popular now.
I don't know.
It's interesting.
But if they actually put out a solid music game and supported it with enough download content and had all the community stuff, I think it would do really well.
I agree, because yeah, the Def Jam game actually, it actually, I gotta say this, I actually kind of wanted to play it, you know, in the privacy of my own home when nobody's watching.
I kind of want Irene to play it.
She would be a lot of fun.
You know, my birthday is coming up.
Maybe I should ask the birthday fairy for some Irene playing Def Jam Rapstar.
She could get discovered by a Def Jam scout talent.
You know, they had some Rapstars actually there at E3 doing the rapping.
Lucha Libre AAA
They didn't just have the game at Konami's booth, but then I guess the developers or somebody else had a whole huge area right behind it where they were doing the whole who's going to be on the box for the game.
That's awesome.
And just all these wrestling matches going on all day.
I guess I was glad it kind of drew people in and kept them away from other stuff, but I was just like, dang, there was a heck of people over there.
I didn't realize wrestling was so popular.
Yeah.
Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Every week we dive in the mailbag and read emails for you guys.
I'm going to take over this week since DarkSakura is still a little bit rough over there with her voice.
So hopefully she'll be better soon.
Although I should say there's not a lot to read.
I'm very disappointed in the listenership that during E3 week there's only two emails.
that you guys want us to read.
I'm hoping we get more this week after the wrap-up show.
Please send us some emails.
Mailbag at orangeandre.com I especially want to hear from people who have never emailed us before.
Because sometimes we get these emails.
I've been listening for two years and I've never emailed you guys.
Why not?
We want to hear from you guys.
What do you guys think of E3?
Come on.
We won't make fun of your spelling and grammar too much.
We promise.
First email from Robert M. Do you think the announcement of Portal 2 and Steamworks for the PS3 is related to the introduction of Steam on the Mac?
Yes and no.
I don't think they're necessarily directly related.
I think it's more of a, you know, hey, yay, Valve and PS3 are playing nicely.
But I think definitely it is a huge card in Steam's pocket that it's multi-platform.
I'm going to go off in a different direction though.
Speaking of gaming on the Mac and so forth, one thing we haven't talked much about, that OnLive was there at E3 and they had a pretty big presence.
And from the demos they were showing, it looked pretty good.
The games were playing pretty well over those little console boxes.
And apparently the system is out now on the PC and the Mac.
And apparently, I'm even seeing the feedback on Twitter and so forth, it actually runs pretty well.
Well, I'll be damned.
I know, I'll be damned, huh?
Who knew?
Who knew?
But as far as Steam goes, you know, I think certainly Steam is trying to expand all these different places because it definitely looks good for them.
I don't know why I went on the tangent of online, but I guess just the whole like new stuff on the Mac.
Mac gamers, what a niche audience.
No, I'm just kidding.
Mac gamers have had a lot to celebrate this year.
I'll tell you that much.
That's for sure.
Going to this other email from Brian S., who didn't have a fancy little nickname, but we'll say Brian S. Hey, OLR gang.
While reading the news on the PS Move and the MS Connect, I started wondering.
These two items are really just expensive peripherals for a console, but have any console peripherals really been successful?
Sure, during the NES era, I loved Power Glove and Play Track and Field on the Power Pad.
But just like ROB, they never have more than one or two games for them.
Ignoring peripherals that are specifically made for a game, i.e.
music and dance genre games, most peripherals like the Super Scope, Sega CD, 32X, PS2 Hard Drive, iToy, and probably quite a few others I can't remember, seem to lack support and third-party game development initial launch titles.
Do you think the same could happen to Kinect slash Move if initial game sales are low?
um no I say well I say yes as far as at least the move is concerned um I think though it's it's tricky because you say well you can count these games but you can't count these well-selling games I mean I realize that the music and dance things are a little more niche but if you look at connect as like really opening up the exercise exercise gaming thing then it's a little niche too well let's look at the Wii Fit balance board they use that in a lot of games
I mean, it's an add-on thing, but they use that.
Wii Motion Plus, it's being used in a lot of things.
And iToy was used a lot more than I think you might be giving it credit for, especially in games for the younger audience.
I mean, those aren't really specialized peripherals or anything, but if you think about it, a lot of the stuff that they put out that's specialized peripherals, I mean, it's specialized for a reason.
It's only going to be used for a few things.
I mean, I understand what you're talking about, like the whole eye toy and the PlayStation eye camera or the Xbox 360 motion camera, which was a big waste of money, and I need to turn that in for some, like, store credit somewhere, because, man.
Oh, what a waste that turned out being.
Yeah, exactly.
So...
Yeah, I mean, I understand that.
Expectations, I guess, for that were a little bit greater than they were now.
Because I think with the PlayStation, well, even with the motion camera on the Xbox 360, I think they were thinking it's going to be doing these kind of Kinect things, but it just doesn't have the technology to really support that.
YYR in our chats is saying yes, absolutely yes to this question of will the same fate be met if initial game sales are low.
He's saying this is why Kinect should be $99 and not a penny more.
I agree that if they don't have a really awesome game pack in with this game or with Kinect, the $150 is unfortunately past the sweet spot.
a lot of people are going to be in for an unpleasant shock too that if Kinect is $150 and it's sitting right next to a Wii that's also $150 there's going to be people out there that don't realize you need an Xbox 360 to actually use Kinect and it's going to be depressing for some people
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura and Sky, I hope you're both feeling better.
If not, I hope you get well soon.
Aw, thank you.
I'm doing much better than I was the nightly show.
I am better, it's just that my throat was really damaged and it hasn't fully healed yet.
and that's from Brian S again and also one more thing.
P.S.
Part of the reason I wrote this email was to have a reason to write I love to power glove.
It's so bad.
There you go.
That's your emails for this week.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Please fill up our mailbag and so that way when DarkSakura's voice is all better she has some work to do.
We like giving DarkSakura lots of work to do, don't we?
Alright, some more gaming news for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR but don't call yet.
It ain't open yet.
Loki.
one of the last things that they showed off during the Ubisoft press conference and they didn't really show anything they just kind of hinted at that it's coming the Michael Jackson game the one that was rumored to be in development is now being developed by Ubisoft and no word exactly on what it is but it's something that's possibly going to be some singing dancing game that does support the Kinect I think it's very sad that it's not Sega
PSP, Wii, and DS
Anywhere they can milk that guy for more money in the afterlife, they will.
In other words.
Yeah.
Am I right?
You're right.
Hey, this is pretty cool because I remember these games.
They were a lot of fun.
Apparently, Burger King is going to be coming back to the 360.
That's right.
The Burger King guy is coming back, and this time it has to do with Kinect Games.
Buying all of them.
Every single one.
I don't care how terrible they are.
I am buying all of them.
No news on the details, no news on the style, no news on the number of games.
All that's being said so far is from Burger King Chief Marketing Officer Mike Capit saying, Our first endeavor with Xbox 360 took the gaming world by storm, so we couldn't pass up the chance to come together on another cutting edge program.
During this year's promotion, our guests can look forward to an even greater adventure that will stimulate the imaginations of gamers and entertainment lovers of all shapes and sizes.
They were so...
Like, Sneak King was so creepy.
You don't understand.
You cannot get more creepier than that game.
It is absolutely worth the money.
I don't care how terrible they are.
Because terrible games can sometimes be good games.
Like, for example, Driver 3.
Terrible game.
Let's not forget, the games were $5.
$4.
$3.99.
My bad.
$4.
It was an amazing deal.
Hopefully they're just as expensive this year.
That'd be great.
That should be the packing right there.
There you go.
There's your reason to plunk $150 on Kinect.
There you go, skeptics.
Sneak King 2 featuring Kinect.
I think it's going to be pretty awesome.
I have high hopes for the Kinect.
Don't screw me again, damn camera games.
I learned my lesson with I actually bought the camera for every single damn system they've all failed me so far except I did not buy the camera that was on the Wii because I don't like exercise games but whatever anyways so yeah
There's some more features being announced for LittleBigPlanet 2.
Lots of cool stuff that they're showing in the whole community features.
One aspect they're saying that, of course, getting revamped is all the stuff that they had.
It's going to be easier to find players' creations.
And, of course, they're going to have a different interface now.
No longer will you have to search across planets to find different levels.
and you'll be able to actually bring them up in a list.
Also different metrics like genres, keywords, etc.
And they're also saying that they're going to be
www.lilbigplanet.me
And in it, of course, you can see the pages in the browsers.
The games will be automatically queued up the next time you play your game if you pick different levels on there.
Also, you can just, I guess, print out one of the QR barcodes assigned to each level and you pop it in front of your PlayStation Eye.
and your creations come up.
That'd be kind of cool if you made some games or whatever, put it on your business card, put that little barcode on there and then people can scan your barcode or your business card and your level pops up.
Or, Rob, let's think here for a second.
Wouldn't it be awesome to get LittleBigPlanet 2?
You make business cards with, say, our website on it with that barcode.
And when you load that level, it has a bunch of information about our website, the podcast, all that stuff in the level.
It's like a playable business card.
Or those shirts we've been talking about doing for seven years.
You could put the barcode on the shirt.
Or maybe we need OLR pants.
So that way the barcode is on the butt, and it could be, here, scan my butt.
And you could play LittleBigPlanet 2, the Orange Lounge Radio Experience, using your butt.
I think that's a great idea.
We need to oil our pants.
DarkSakura, do they let you make your own pants with logos on the butt?
It wouldn't be hard.
There's gotta be a way to do it.
I mean, who cares about shirts when you can have OLR with a barcode butt?
You can do that.
You can do, I think, on those cafe press and stuff like that, you can do boxers and stuff.
OLR underwear with the barcode on your butt.
It wouldn't be too hard to design a transfer.
It really wouldn't.
That's an even better idea.
I wanna play the OLR level.
Pull down your pants.
Oh, this is just wrong.
I'll show you my little big planet.
That's what you say on the back.
It would say little big planet.
And on the front, it would just say big planet.
With two moons that orbit it.
All right.
I'm in a room with children.
Tonight's show has been way too serious.
E3 is serious business.
We needed some barcodes on your ass to break the tension a little bit.
SSJ100 Matt asks, will that barcode make it easier to friend your butt?
Maybe that's what Nintendo plans to do with Friend Codes.
We need to have a repeat of the Seaman video.
Maybe after the show.
I know.
Maybe later.
We'll do that.
Maybe later.
Alright, but we gotta... Serious business, guys.
E3 is serious business.
What are you laughing at?
You mentioned that he's all, fuck clothes, I want an OLR tattoo.
I actually saw the other day when I was searching for stuff to do the stencils for the baby's room.
They do have
things you can get where you can print your own temporary tattoos that could happen
An OLR temporary tattoo?
Yes.
That's about what the giveaways were at E3 this year, by the way.
I know people think you walk out of E3 with bags and bags of crap and them giving away 360s at the one press conference.
Yeah, it used to be that way, but now in this economy, you're lucky if you get a temporary tattoo.
My boss brought me a Tron Evolution t-shirt that has the disc on the back.
What?
I didn't get that.
And also I got a Power Gig t-shirt.
I fucking played Tron.
I didn't get the Tron shirt.
I have a Tron shirt.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right.
Oh, and BlackWolf is mad now.
He didn't get a Rock Band 3 shirt.
Good.
We're even.
All right.
We are officially even.
All right.
One more story for you guys.
Then we're going to take some calls at 877-GAME-OLR.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
And that is a new controller coming out for the PlayStation 3 that was being shown at E3.
It was from Hori.
And they are marketing a PS3 MMO controller.
Final Fantasy XIV, DC Universe
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know, it kind of reminds me of, remember how they had that keyboard for Phantasy Star, I think, on the GameCube or something like that?
Yes.
It's like that.
But honestly, though, just buy a USB keyboard.
You don't need this fancy piece of shit.
Toagak wants to know the time to penis for this controller because it does have a little curvature there where it looks like you would grab that little controller thing.
I would expect it to be longer than, say, the other We Relax type thing just because it's not obvious to put your penis in there.
And it'll probably come out in Japan first, and they're not as disgusting as we are here in America.
So I would say it's going to be at least a few days.
You think they're not?
You think, Rob?
I guess that's true.
Let me say, it's not as obvious all over the internet.
You think, with underwear vending machines, Rob, and moe lap pillows...
That's true.
This is the country that's ooga booga.
This is the country that brought us the Hello Kitty vibrator.
Hold on, hold on.
Because they're not so repressed by having all of that, there's no need to put your penis on an MMO controller.
That's true.
Because you have all these other.
But here in America where everybody's sheltered, everybody gets freaky deaky behind closed doors.
They call it the pecan.
All right.
What?
Eh, whatever.
See, see, Bobby agreed.
I think I'm on to something, though, with the fact that we don't notice it as much because they're not as repressed as we are over here.
Oh, shoot.
Yeah, the same country that gave us La Blue Girl.
I guess that's true, too.
But still, they're not...
Tentacle porn, Rob!
Tentacle porn.
You're not hearing about them putting their dicks in things.
It's just that they marry inanimate objects.
No, wait, that was in Japan anyway.
Actually, I was listening to a podcast just recently called Stuff Mom Never Told You.
Uh-oh.
It's by the people that did Stuff You Missed in History class.
Yeah, those are the podcasts I listen to, hello.
But they were talking about how there actually is an epidemic sort of going around now in Japan where men are sort of withdrawing from dating and it's not that, you know, it's just that they're not interested in sex at all.
That's why they have, the guy married his lap pillow and the guy married his video game and all of this and...
TigerClaw in our chatroom says, don't be surprised when people start taking photos of their 3D penis on the 3DS.
Some... Some...
Chick or whatever, plain scantily clad, you know, God, whatever, Just Dance, Just Lap Dance, you know.
Upskirt Cam 3D.
Or, you know, Dance Central.
Pole Dance Central, yeah.
BlackWolfInChat says, Sky is thinking about Craigslist 3D penis postings.
Wave of the future, folks.
Wave of the future.
I don't want to see that wave of the future.
I had to share the image with our chat room.
Of?
Of the poster for Lovely Girl Live Action.
So what you're suggesting is that it's Chatroulette 3D.
Oh, God.
What do you think is worse on the internet?
Craigslist or Chatroulette?
Chatroulette.
Even though you got robbed of a several hundred dollar machine on Craigslist, you still think Chatroulette is worse?
Probably.
I've never been on Chatroulette, so I can only imagine, though.
Nice.
We should do OLR on Chatroulette one night just for fun.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
What?
What's that?
You guys are gay.
Okay.
All right.
Let's open up the Skype line.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
The Skype line is now open for business.
Ossifer is saying I should go to Chatroulette right now.
No, I'm not going to go to Chatroulette right now.
I'm not going to derail the show completely with Chatroulette.
Although I would like to see maybe a podcast with some of the video game people just playing on Chatroulette.
It would be fun.
Although the joke would probably get old real quick.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Give us a call if you want to ask us anything about E3 or talk about anything at E3 or maybe there was something on the show floor you didn't get to see enough of.
I don't know.
Give us a call and we'll have some words.
In the meantime, Loki, you got any last minute stories for us?
Yes.
Let's talk about the Summer of Arcade.
Coming out, of course, this summer, they have announced the lineup for Summer of Arcade, including Castlevania Harmony of Despair, Hydro Thunder Hurricane, Lorecraft and the Guardian of Light, Limbo, and Monday Night Combat.
If you buy all of those, you will get a refund for 800 Microsoft Points or $10.
Ooh, $10!
$10!
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Legend of Zaku
Just here on my bed with my Mac.
Let's see.
All that post E3 stuff that you're still trying to digest, I suppose.
And you too.
I guess the highlight of that event for me was basically seeing the Gran Turismo 5 trailer.
Ah, that was completely missed by us here at OLR.
That's right.
Finally, a freaking date for Gran Turismo 5.
I don't just play dancing games.
I'm a big sucker for those racing games.
racing simulator games if you're a fan of racing games let me tell you this on the 3DS there was a demo on the floor for Ridge Racer it looked great but it played like garbage so I really hope this was just like a concept demo and that the real thing is fixed because when you run into a wall it's like not even realistic your car will turn like 45 degrees when you run into a wall it's crazy I like the PSP Ridge Racer games the
I can't imagine it'd be too hard to port that stuff over.
But Mario Kart, that concept video looked great, but I know that's not realistic racing, but I just thought I'd throw that in there.
I mean, when I actually saw the trailer, I couldn't imagine how detailed
How much effort was put into actually making it look almost realistic.
Hence the reason for the number of delays.
So, at least in this video game generation, Duke Nukem Forever kind of got lost.
Whereas, well, in other words, GT5 managed to beat out Duke Nukem Forever and
and like Vaporware that never actually became Vaporware.
But it's going to happen.
It's going to happen.
Hey, Duke Nukem at least has the Manhattan game for whatever it's worth.
Let me ask you this, Zaku, since you're a racing game fan and you kind of bring up what happened at the press conferences.
What did you think of Microsoft showing off Forza with no wheel?
Is that interesting to you or are you just kind of like gimmick, gimmick, this is lame?
I need a wheel.
I need a physical wheel to grab onto.
Something tangible.
Not some Mickey Mouse pretend wheel.
If I want to do that, I could just do that right now by just moving my hands at 10 and 2 in the air.
So you're probably pissed about Mad Catz having to discontinue that wheel, huh?
No, I want like a Logitech wheel or something.
Mad Catz is taking over production of that wheel.
Microsoft is continuing it.
Mad Catz is taking over production of it.
I took it away from the story that it just wasn't happening, period.
No, because I thought that they even had a picture of the Mad Catz one that looked exactly like the other one, unless that was Photoshopped, which it could have been.
I was going to say what would be kind of cool is with these new camera peripherals and whatever, to have something that incorporates where you actually play the game, say, with a controller, and then you can make a gesture or something like that to...
Right, shift up and down, break.
But then you need enough space to actually get... You need enough surface area to actually get the actual... You know, the person...
to actually get their image in there for the camera to do its logic to detect moves.
Or not even necessarily anything that has to do with shifting, but perspective change or something like that so you can do a little bit of head tracking.
Head tracking, they already said, Sony already said that it's going to be supported for Gran Turismo 5 via the camera.
It's just that I guess head tracking would make sense if you actually had...
Like a VR headset, not just through a TV.
It wouldn't feel right if I'm just tilting my head one way and I couldn't even see that angle.
If it was trying to do that sort of head tracking.
Unless I actually saw it in front of me.
Alright, well, Zaku, I want to change the topic one more time here before we let you go.
Because I know you've been a long-time listener of the show and you know a lot about music games.
Surely you have an opinion on Dance Masters.
Yeah, you mean that new Konami game for the Kinect, right?
Yes.
Yeah, I actually read the interview on Bamani Style with Naoki, and he's basically trying to, you know, he's trying to pitch that game, trying to, like, because, you know, I mean...
It's going to be a tough battle between what Harmonix is dishing out.
Because I think, if anything, Konami's pretty much missed the boat on some of these major events in the past 10 years of where they could have capitalized on the whole rhythm gaming genre in this country.
And their failure to do it resulted in the prominence and rise of folks like Activision, Harmonix And they missed the boat on so many occasions I don't really think I can take them seriously But that's not to say that I'm going to shun this game completely
I know with the new motion control scheme, it kind of replaces the pads.
From that perspective, you don't have to worry about buying a dedicated peripheral just for that game.
If the camera can actually see your whole body and accurately detect all the movements...
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, if Microsoft really, really wanted to impress me, those rooms, the little bubbles that they were showing Kinect in on the show floor, instead of being bright, light rooms, would have looked like actual people's living rooms.
But maybe they weren't ready to take that chance.
Last year when I actually heard of Project Natal, I didn't realize, I actually didn't take them that seriously just because they were doing something that Nintendo's already done.
and Sony to an extent with the PS, with the Itway back in the PlayStation days.
And then one year later we see how far, how advanced this camera is and it's pretty much something in its own, that can stand on its own.
Because it's not just any old Mickey Mouse camera that tries to detect a 2D image.
of that actor, it actually has another dimension to it.
So if it's that accurate with that type of detection, that could really push Microsoft far in this whole new genre that they're trying to dish out.
All right.
Well, Zaku, we've got to let you go to get more calls, but thank you very much for your call, and happy racing or dancing, whatever you choose to do.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call and interact with our program here tonight.
Meanwhile, I'll ask Loki if there's some other news he wants to touch on.
Yeah, we can talk a little bit about how...
The, uh, well, different games that they have for the PlayStation Move.
They did announce, like, their full list of games that are, um, well, I guess coming soon.
First party, they've got Beach Sketchers, which I have no idea what the hell that is.
SOCOM 4, Ipet, Kung Fu Rider, which is that one that you ride down the office chairs, but now they added Kung Fu to it, I guess.
Sports Champions, Start the Party, Echo Chrome 2, Tumble, Hustle Kings, The Fight Lights Out, The Shoot, TV Superstars, High Velocity Bowling, because they always need bowling, Pain, which is that demo for Pain, Heavy Rain is going to be getting support later on, Sing Star Dance, Little Big Planet 2, The Sly Collection, Heroes on the Move, which looks terrible, Killzone 3, and Sorcery, which looks really terrible.
You didn't like the sorcery demo?
That looks stupid.
Alright, let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Sterlok.
Hey, Sterlok, what's on your mind?
Uh, not much.
I was, uh, just wanted to give my thoughts and impressions about E3.
Yeah, please do.
What'd you think?
Um, I was pretty impressed.
Um...
I'm actually... You probably wouldn't expect me to say this, but I'm actually looking forward to the 3DS.
Now, of course, for listeners that may not know why that's a surprise, because they're new to Orange Lounge Radio, why would that be a surprise to people?
Because I'm totally blind.
The 3D aspect of it is kind of meaningless to me, but the reason I'm looking forward to it is because apparently
There's going to be a much higher capacity for data storage.
I'm looking forward to how the audio is going to improve especially with the really impressive lineup of games.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Absolutely.
I mean, certainly the games are part of what wins me over as well.
You know, as neat as 3D is.
Star Fox 64, Ocarina of Time, Paper Mario, Super Street Fighter 4, I'm really looking forward to that.
See how they do that.
You know what's really sad that they did not have a demo for or even in development?
A new F-Zero game with 3D.
Yeah, you know what?
I'm surprised with everything else that was announced.
Maybe in 24 years.
I immediately thought of you when that was announced.
Funny enough, I think a lot of listeners did.
Also,
I don't know if you guys got to see it
The new Mortal Kombat looks just freaking insane.
You know, sadly, there was a huge line just to get in and see it, although apparently it was playable in that little room that they were showing, and unfortunately we didn't get in there.
It was just a matter of prioritizing.
As much of a fan of Mortal Kombat as I am, there was just other stuff I wanted to see more.
It was getting a lot of very positive buzz, though, from the people that saw it.
It sounds like the franchise is going back in the right direction, which is good.
Thank goodness, yeah.
Thank God, it's what it needed.
I think that trailer is all you really need to see.
With the exception of DC Universe, I was not too impressed with the last few games.
Especially with that stupid story mode slash RPG element that was in a lot of them.
Yeah, and then they tried to do the puzzle combat, and it just spread itself too thin, I think.
Puzzle combat and, what was it, motor combat, where they were trying to be like Mario Kart.
Oh, yeah, I remember when the Mortal Kombat game just randomly had the Mario Kart mode in it.
Like, what the hell was that?
I think that was more for, like, just being funny.
I mean, that was the whole point, is like, ha, like, we're funny.
Yeah, it still sucked.
Yeah.
Well, Sterlok, was there anything else out of E3 that really made you excited besides just the 3DS?
Um...
Not really, I thought the move looked kind of stupid.
It seemed like, okay, it's kind of like what you guys thought.
It's basically the Wii, but with better graphics.
I think when you put these new things side by side, the move and the 3DS, the reason why, you know, Loki just read off the big list of games that are coming to the move, and I'm kind of just going, eh.
either I already played it with a controller or I can play it with a controller or I'm just not really interested in dropping the money just to play it with a move.
I am kind of looking forward to connect though with seeing how the voice commands work.
I'm really curious because voice recognition kind of has this reputation of being a little iffy.
So I'm really curious how that's going to
Me too, because that's not something they were really showing off at E3 again.
I think they might have been a little nervous about that technology.
They mentioned it a little bit.
And I guess what you do is you just say, you know, Xbox Play or whatever.
But yeah, they didn't show it off very extensively.
Alright, later.
See ya.
Quick question from SSJ100Matt Why is it that when Nintendo ports GameCube to the Wii, we poo-poo it, but when the 3DS ports a lot of N64 games, we praise them?
That's a good question.
I don't.
I actually think all the porting makes me nervous.
I don't really praise it.
In fact, I think Ocarina of Time, once again, overrated damn game.
Um...
I could care less that it's on there.
Star Fox 64 was kind of fun, but yeah, I don't want to see a bunch of old 64 games just being ported over because they can.
It's neat to see these things in 3D for the first time, I'll give you that, but is it $30 neat or however much they're going to charge for these games?
You know they're going to be more expensive than a regular DS game.
This is just going to be an excuse to jack up the price 5-10 bucks.
You know that, right?
You know that.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is DT.
Hey, DT.
What's on your mind, buddy?
You know, watching the E3 coverage all week.
How is E3 from the comfort of your living room?
Oh, it's still pretty good.
Oh, everything Nintendo had is pretty surprising.
Oh yeah.
All those first party games coming?
Mm-hmm.
Lots and lots of stuff.
What did you think of Connect and Move?
I thought that was cool.
You know, we pretty much called it as far as the Dance Masters goes.
That was the first thing we said was they should have like a Paratype game for...
I'm not sure if I said it but I think someone here did and yeah they got it right you guys hit the nail on the head whereas I said yeah right you're never going to get a para para game in the US and here it is but I think we can all agree this is as close as you're ever going to get if Dance Masters is not enough for you have a night of fire in it with the actual para dance from back in the day I don't think there's really going to be anything that's going to make you happy at all
You know what's really funny is that was actually one of my future RetroReview articles was going to be about all those motion-controlled dancing games like ParaPara and Dance Maniac and all of that.
I was just watching some videos of it randomly Wow
Oh, wow.
Oh yeah.
It's not that hard to set up.
Yeah, it's very interesting that that was the most popular thing though.
Probably the only other thing that really had a line was maybe either 2DX Sirius or DJ Max Technica.
I was like, hold notes?
What are these hold notes in my 2DX?
You know I have Dance Maniacs.
Huh.
I have a Dance Maniacs.
The actual machine?
I have the arcade board.
I have a working arcade.
I have a System 573 board.
It's sitting at my desk.
It's a footrest right now.
Hook it up, dummy!
Let's play.
Well, DT, did you have anything else you wanted to share with our listeners today?
Alright, thank you so much for all the hard work you do on those articles We really appreciate it at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Lots of good stuff there Alright, thanks so much GT, you have a good week You too Alright, that's our own Dark Tetsuya Who writes articles for OrangeLoungeRadio.com You can rig that up, it wouldn't be that difficult to do I know, and I think you've got a new project now
I have to finish the ones I have right now.
Yeah, apparently you can use the PlayStation 3 DualShock controller instead of the Moves navigation controller.
This navigation controller costs $30 by itself.
Seriously, $30.
$80 per controller if you add the two together.
This is interesting.
Bobby Kotick, evil guy that works for Activision.
Whose idea it probably was to not have a booth and instead have that party.
Call of Duty Online Call of Duty Online
in other words he thinks that people that buy Call of Duty are suckers and that they're willing to pay extra money to play online with Call of Duty and to be honest with those $15 map packs that sell like crazy he might be right
Which is really sad.
Of course, everyone wants to compare console versus console.
Well, now Amazon has different interests, of course, that show on their website for pre-orders, whatever, for Kinect and for the Move.
And right now...
Apparently, Kinect holds the number one spot on their top selling video games list, with the Xbox 360, the new one, right behind it.
And the first mention of the PlayStation Move is the navigation controller, which is at number 44, and the Move starter bundle at number 46.
So apparently, right now, there is more interest in the Xbox Kinect.
TigerClaw TigerClaw
I played the volleyball game because the dodgeball wasn't demo-able.
It was cute, but I think it's more of a kid's game.
It's too simple.
It's basically Mario Tennis, but they just have a bunch of different sports re-skinned and stuff.
The basketball's kind of neat because it's a little bit like that Mario 3 on 3 basketball game they have on the DS.
Speaking of basketball, here's a game I didn't mention.
NBA Jam on the Wii was out there on the show floor.
It looked pretty awesome, I gotta say.
I'm very, I'm interested in it.
Yes, I'm interested in a sports game, OMG.
YYR in our chat room speaking on the Bobby Kotek story just said, says, Bobby Kotek, to increase our profit margins further, I would love to personally fuck all of our customers in the ass.
Of course they would have to pay me for it first.
I'm not sure how that increases profit margins.
Might increase something.
There's some pictures that came out showing the baby, babysitting mama controller, which looks like mama's head on a baby.
I guess, it's kind of creepy I want to say My Babysitting Mama That could be a song I got distracted, Rob
I think it would have been funnier if the baby mama had looked like cooking mama, but was black.
Rob, I got distracted.
What?
By our own wiki.
Why?
I found the Kmart page.
Our wiki's pretty awesome.
I know.
If you've never been to the Orange Lounge Radio wiki, you can either access it at orangeloungeradio.com, and then in the little box on the left-hand side, there's a W, or just go to orangeloungeradio.wikia, W-I-K-I-A dot com, and there's all this like...
And I mean that in the most positive, thankful way to our listeners that put it together.
Useless information about our show.
We need much more of that, too.
Did they ever put up our Never Forget?
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.
I don't know if I saw it.
You better seek that out.
TigerClaw says it was Bionic Commando Rearm 2 playable at E3.
Not out in the open.
No.
Capcom was showing off some other stuff.
Any other quick stories, Loki?
Dancer's Revolution X2 the arcade version will be out in Japan July 7th.
It's kind of neat, I guess.
Maybe we'll see it over here at some point.
Um...
and I think that's pretty much it.
Alright.
Well, before we get to the final thoughts, I've got to say this, because we've been so dominated with E3 news, I didn't have a chance to say this earlier in the show, so unfortunately it just was a bad week, but seriously, a very, very happy Father's Day to all the gaming daddies listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
I know there's a few of you, and I hope you had a wonderful Father's Day.
Loki, very soon to join those ranks.
Well, duh.
Again, yeah.
Yeah.
So, happy Father's Day to all the OLR daddies listening.
Now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up the show.
DarkSakura, your final thought for tonight.
Our wiki is awesome and needs more stuff.
My final thought is tacos are awesome and need more stuff.
Loki?
I need to paint the baby's room and I have a lot of work ahead of me.
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
All we ask and all we've asked for the past eight years, if you enjoy our show, just tell people about the show.
Help us spread the word of the show through word of mouth.
you know retweet and post links on Facebook and help us get more fans that's all we ask because we don't have a lot of marketing dollars or anything like that to pour into this show it would be nice if we had a million dollars but we don't and if you do get a million dollars apparently if you are a million dollar operation not only do you get invited to the conference but they'll just throw 360s at you who knew
So no, we really appreciate it, you guys.
Thank you guys so much.
Have a wonderful week.
Until next time, we will be back at Orange Mountain Radio for our 8th year anniversary.
But until then, have a wonderful week.
We'll see you next week.

Okay so um something happened tonight that hasn't happened in uh 370 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio um that's pretty amazing or actually 371 episodes of Orange Lounge Radio we completely forgot the FUs of the week that we've been doing ever since episode one but Loki as the credits were rolling thank you Loki was like hey wait a minute we didn't do the FUs of the week
So, uh, thank God the recording is still recording and we can squeeze in right here at the very, very end the We Didn't Procrastinate FUs of the Week.
Um, no voice, fuck it.
Sucks.
My FU of the week goes to the fact, A, that I forgot the FUs of the week, and B, that I've been so tired.
I've been running on empty this week.
And just FU, no joke, to calling my phone.
I was up very late last night taking Shane to the airport, which is fine.
I volunteered to do that.
We had fun.
But FU to the unnamed individual who called my phone.
I am not exaggerating nine times this morning because I didn't answer the first pickup.
Seriously, that was excessive.
Knock it off, I'm trying to sleep.
Loki.
F you to Jury Duty.
I thankfully have dodged it for tomorrow, but I'm still on standby for possibly the day after, so it sucks.
I hate wasting my day at Jury Duty.
Also, I hate downtown Sacramento because I hate parking there.
Jury Duty's fun if it's like Law & Order.
But it never is.
It's like, hey, we're going to be having a four-month trial that talks about spousal abuse.
Guilty!
You're out.
All right.
There we go.
We fit in the FUs of the week just barely in the nick of time.
So now we can fade to black.
Good night, everybody, and thanks for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
