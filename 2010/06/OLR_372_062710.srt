00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,497
14 from showing up on 360, the classic PC game showing

2
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:36,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, my friends on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:42,121
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:42,481
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

5
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It is that show, as we say, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:46,904 --> 00:00:49,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And joining me over the next three hours, say hello.

7
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:50,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my name is Rob Roberts, in case you didn't know.

8
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:54,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Joining me over the next few hours, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,449
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

10
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:55,950
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

11
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,071
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

12
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday.

13
00:00:58,553 --> 00:00:59,154
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay.

14
00:00:59,254 --> 00:00:59,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday.

15
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:00,475
[SPEAKER_09]: We're old.

16
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:00,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

17
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:04,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

18
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:05,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

19
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:06,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday.

20
00:01:07,537 --> 00:01:08,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not my birthday.

21
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's the show's birthday.

22
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:10,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

23
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:15,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio turned eight years old this week on June the 23rd was our first show.

24
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:16,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

25
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:18,946
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm saying happy birthday to everybody.

26
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:23,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I did have an actual birthday yesterday, but we don't talk about that because I really am old.

27
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm four times the age of the show.

28
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's older than you in this room?

29
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:29,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Me.

30
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:30,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So shut up.

31
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:31,695
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

32
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:38,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's go ahead and introduce tonight a special guest we have here in studio.

33
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:44,040
[SPEAKER_09]: A very special, I almost said spatial guest because he takes up space, as he usually does here on this show.

34
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,941
[SPEAKER_09]: We always give him a hard time.

35
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,301
[SPEAKER_04]: He takes up less space than each of us.

36
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:47,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, yes.

37
00:01:48,022 --> 00:01:49,602
[SPEAKER_09]: He's actually a skinny motherfucker.

38
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:50,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate him for it, but that's okay.

39
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:51,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello.

40
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:52,984
[SPEAKER_09]: He has not been here in...

41
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

42
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:09,554
[SPEAKER_09]: 23rd Magus

43
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:41,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's all these little in-jokes that go with Drew Nami.

44
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:46,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you used to come to the show a lot back in the heyday.

45
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:53,577
[SPEAKER_09]: We all played DDR and all those arrow stomping and arm waving and button mashing and all those fun music games we used to play back in the day.

46
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:59,282
[SPEAKER_09]: But I gotta say, I don't know if you heard, but there's more than 12 people listening to Orange Lounge Radio now.

47
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:00,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really... No!

48
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:01,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right?

49
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:01,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

50
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:02,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Who would have thought, right?

51
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:03,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

52
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:07,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Catch up some of the people who've never heard you on this program before.

53
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,170
[SPEAKER_09]: What kind of games do you play?

54
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,133
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you into, and why are you here on this show?

55
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:22,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm still kind of the big Bomani buff, although that's kind of waned a bit in the past couple of years since, you know, the genre's kind of waned.

56
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:26,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the RPG, the MMO buff.

57
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:27,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

58
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:32,454
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's Square, if it's Bioware, I've probably played it.

59
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:35,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I just play a very diverse set of games.

60
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,582
[SPEAKER_09]: You must be looking very much forward to that new Star Wars game that's by Bioware.

61
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:42,644
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an MMO.

62
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:43,925
[SPEAKER_09]: The Old Republic?

63
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,566
[SPEAKER_09]: The new one.

64
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:46,147
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the new one?

65
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even remember.

66
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:48,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Star Wars The Old Republic.

67
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:48,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

68
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:49,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

69
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,272
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people say it's going to be a WoW killer.

70
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:54,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Me, as the kind of WoW addict, I say no.

71
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does there have to be a WoW killer?

72
00:03:57,176 --> 00:04:04,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yes, I realize 11 million people are subscribed to WoW, but, you know, there's a lot more people on the planet.

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,380
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

74
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't think WoW is going to die by the hands of one game.

75
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It may die by the hands of itself one day.

76
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:16,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll get into that later because I'm really, really mad at WoW this week.

77
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:17,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Really mad.

78
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:19,887
[SPEAKER_04]: The Roman Empire was responsible for its own destruction.

79
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:22,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And who cares about EverQuest anymore?

80
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:30,526
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to come a day where WoW is going to have to go through a major overhaul to stay current.

81
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,569
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes these overhauls are not received very well.

82
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:34,270
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

83
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to get too far off topic because it's too much crystal ball.

84
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:44,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a lot of people just don't juggle multiple MMOs and I think the markets sort of reach in saturation if you ask me.

85
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:57,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com and look at some comments as you folks chat live with us because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

86
00:04:57,724 --> 00:04:58,984
[SPEAKER_09]: He's on at about 5 Pacific.

87
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:03,125
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on at about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, but sometimes we run late.

88
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:04,246
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a deal.

89
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:13,948
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, but we're here taping live, so please, if you're listening live to us on All Games, join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

90
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:18,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Ziba in our chatroom says, every new MMO is said to be the WoW killer.

91
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:22,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when Warhammer Online was going to be the WoW killer?

92
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when Ion was going to be the WoW killer?

93
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:27,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when Eve was supposed to be the WoW killer?

94
00:05:28,437 --> 00:05:30,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Eve still has a pretty strong cult following.

95
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it's still very niche.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,321
[SPEAKER_23]: Star Trek Online always.

97
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:39,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, here we have Jamie, and her thing is Star Trek Online.

98
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:40,344
[SPEAKER_23]: And it was Ragnarok.

99
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:45,727
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Star Trek Online is a good example Does it have as many people as WoW?

100
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:49,390
[SPEAKER_09]: No But is it probably doing successful for itself?

101
00:05:49,830 --> 00:06:04,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure It's probably making money I doubt Star Trek Online took all these people away from WoW I think it kind of carved itself to a new audience that maybe wasn't playing WoW before Like Jamie, Jamie quit WoW before STO was out

102
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:14,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it just seems to me that WoW is sort of like... Remember when we discussed Guitar Hero versus, say, Beatmania?

103
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:19,837
[SPEAKER_07]: It brought accessibility to the genre, brought it into the mainstream.

104
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:27,204
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of MMOs are kind of following the WoW formula, so to speak, or incorporating, and vice versa.

105
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:45,475
[SPEAKER_09]: There were so many people when Guitar Hero first came out, especially the group listening to this show that grew up on the Bomani games that were like, freaking rip-off of Guitar Freaks, this is just a stupid rip-off, and Guitar Freaks is better, and the music's better in Guitar Freaks, well, okay.

106
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:50,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when Beatmania US finally came out, reviews called it a rip-off of Guitar Hero.

107
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was ignorant.

108
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that was just straight up written by an intern, ignorant intern that should never... Ignant.

109
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:57,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Ignant.

110
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Ignant intern that should never... That's an insult to interns everywhere.

111
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:01,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I digress.

112
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

113
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:03,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Drew Nami, but, you know.

114
00:07:04,273 --> 00:07:04,993
[SPEAKER_09]: But I digress.

115
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:11,821
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is, is that Guitar Hero, you hit the nail on the head, succeeded where Guitar Freaks failed because...

116
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:17,627
[SPEAKER_09]: and Harmonix, who was the developer at the time, took a risk, a huge risk, and made it accessible.

117
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami, too stubborn to take risks.

118
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:23,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And I still say that's the case with them to an extent today.

119
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:24,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Too stubborn to take risks.

120
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:26,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

121
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:28,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, fun show already.

122
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:29,757
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't gotten into the news.

123
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start off with how was your gaming week?

124
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:33,181
[SPEAKER_09]: We always like to talk about the games we've been playing.

125
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:35,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Ladies first, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

126
00:07:36,864 --> 00:07:38,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was...

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it actually wasn't too bad, because I have a DSi now.

128
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:46,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not say how we acquired such a thing.

129
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:47,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Huzzah!

130
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:47,943
[SPEAKER_10]: You stole it.

131
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:48,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Killed a hobo.

132
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:50,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Killed a hobo, exactly.

133
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,686
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I've actually started Back Into The World Is Not Enough.

134
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:57,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cool game.

135
00:07:57,688 --> 00:07:57,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

136
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:58,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

137
00:07:58,789 --> 00:07:59,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard a lot of neat things about that.

138
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:00,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't spent a lot of time with that myself.

139
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:01,593
[SPEAKER_04]: The world is not enough.

140
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:02,714
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a Bond movie.

141
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:03,455
[SPEAKER_04]: The world ends with you.

142
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:04,617
[SPEAKER_09]: The world ends with you.

143
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, well, I'll tell you what my brain did.

144
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's an insight into how my brain works.

145
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:10,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, the world is not enough.

146
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:13,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Then my brain went, that's not right because that spells out twine.

147
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:15,189
[SPEAKER_04]: What game?

148
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:15,449
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

149
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think of the garbage song.

150
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,371
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how my mind works.

151
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I think of the song from the James Bond movie.

152
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,613
[SPEAKER_04]: The world is not enough.

153
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:21,734
[SPEAKER_04]: T-W-I-N-E.

154
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:22,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I get it.

155
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:22,754
[SPEAKER_09]: T-Wine.

156
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like Twine.

157
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the biggest ball of Twine in... No, that wasn't it.

158
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the cycle that my brain went through.

159
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that's when I realized I was playing Sam and Max.

160
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,324
[SPEAKER_04]: The world ends with you.

161
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when I realized Joshua is still an asshole.

162
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,325
[SPEAKER_04]: and I started actually trying to play Oendon again.

163
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:43,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Which spells out Tiwe.

164
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:51,372
[SPEAKER_04]: So, also we've been watching the Mario Marathon because that's super awesome.

165
00:08:52,373 --> 00:09:02,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've also been sending Dan YouTube videos of this guy playing a bunch of brass instruments, you know, re-recording himself, doing like the Mario 64 theme and playing the euphonium, which is one of my favorite instruments.

166
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:04,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like to say it, euphonium.

167
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:04,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Euphonium.

168
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really about... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

169
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:10,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I played some Portal.

170
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:13,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I lusted over Portal 2 some more.

171
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:18,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And... Oh, yeah, lots... I love your description.

172
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I lusted over Portal 2.

173
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And I played a crap... It can sound like you're watching YouTubes and your tongue is on the floor.

174
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what you do when you lust Rob.

175
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,284
[SPEAKER_04]: So pretty.

176
00:09:31,284 --> 00:09:34,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, and I played a crap ton of Star Trek Online.

177
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:40,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I played enough Star Trek Online in two days to get from Commander 2 to Commander 7.

178
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you have ten ranks in each rank.

179
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm three ranks away from Captain.

180
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:48,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Many ranks.

181
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Captain before my surgery Captain before my surgery

182
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:06,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about your surgery for a minute because it's going to impact the show coming up.

183
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:06,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit.

184
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:07,265
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

185
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:08,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we don't have to, you know.

186
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:08,785
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we can tell.

187
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:09,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

188
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you're going to be having surgery, what, on the hand again, right?

189
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:12,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

190
00:10:13,827 --> 00:10:14,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be a little technical here.

191
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:15,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

192
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I have trigger finger.

193
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also called flexor tendonitis.

194
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it in my middle two fingers on my right hand.

195
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to really know what the surgery goes into, just look it up online.

196
00:10:24,472 --> 00:10:26,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll post something in the chat room and gross everybody out.

197
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:30,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was awake during my last one, and I don't really care about my new one because I'll be awake through that, too.

198
00:10:30,774 --> 00:10:32,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just glad I get my benefits.

199
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:34,592
[SPEAKER_04]: No, insurance.

200
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:37,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, healthcare is the big hot issue here.

201
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:42,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And thankfully, I'll be on FMLA during the layoffs at my company.

202
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:46,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will still have employment at my old company and still have benefits.

203
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:48,557
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get laid off.

204
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:49,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Work that system.

205
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:50,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Work it.

206
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:51,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get laid off.

207
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:55,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hire me, I'm a designer.

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:15,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the whole thing about this though is that basically they're going to cut up, they're going to flame my hand at the palm and cut the tendon sheaths around the middle two fingers and then leave it open because what's going to happen is there's a big knotting there and it's going to grow over the knotting so that the swelling will go down.

209
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:18,889
[SPEAKER_04]: and as a result, I won't be able to use my right hand for at least a week.

210
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:20,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And it'll be replaced by a monkey paw.

211
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:22,311
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

212
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:25,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, actually, a chimpanzee would be cool.

213
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,415
[SPEAKER_09]: She really will be Jamie Summers because they're going to give her a bionic arm.

214
00:11:29,636 --> 00:11:30,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a bionic hand.

215
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:32,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you be able to go go-go gadget finger?

216
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't his middle finger the water pistol one?

217
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:39,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

218
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:40,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it, Rob, you stole my joke.

219
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:47,537
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, um, so I'm gonna go in and have my hand flayed open by a specialist.

220
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:48,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

221
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:52,660
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will- They have specialists that flay hands?

222
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they do.

223
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna be that specialist.

224
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:58,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I will be here for the show.

225
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:05,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I just will be very slow with, uh, you know, probably will not be hanging out in the chat room, or I might be in the chat room just, you know, ghosting, but-

226
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Slamming down random keys.

227
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:11,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best thing about it is Vicodin.

228
00:12:11,987 --> 00:12:17,028
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll sound like a Zaku call when he doesn't stop typing on the keyboard.

229
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's slamming her monkey paw down on the keyboard.

230
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: She's communicating.

231
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:23,089
[SPEAKER_04]: One thump means she's angry.

232
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,029
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want is chimp fingers.

233
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like orangutan fingers.

234
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,490
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really long ones that I can grab things and poke holes in fruit.

235
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: But the best part is drugs.

236
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,033
[SPEAKER_09]: That's always the best part of a surgery.

237
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:40,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be probably on Vicodin because they don't really care if you hurt or not.

238
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:42,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They just want you to not care that you hurt and that's what Vicodin does.

239
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to play tons of video games while you're on drugs.

240
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:46,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, get this.

241
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:49,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time I had my surgery, do you know what I was doing two days later?

242
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:52,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing Blue Dragon all night.

243
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:53,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you think the game was good?

244
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:55,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Blue Dragon.

245
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,068
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

246
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,109
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like playing a Dreamcast game.

247
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,070
[SPEAKER_10]: See what drugs do.

248
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I liked it because it was like playing a Dreamcast game.

249
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:14,556
[SPEAKER_04]: by the way, I also cleaned out a closet today in this preparation for not being able to do any housework and I found my Dreamcast shirt and a crap ton of stuff that I'm sending to our buddy Rob in England

250
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't that nice of you?

251
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

252
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,980
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so no show July 4th.

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,141
[SPEAKER_04]: You send me dirty cards every year.

254
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:22,982
[SPEAKER_09]: No show July 4th because that is the day that America celebrates fire.

255
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:25,744
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're, I mean, that's a very important holiday to us.

256
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're having a block party for my neighborhood on the 3rd, so you totally have to come.

257
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we just might, actually.

258
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:32,547
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got that going on.

259
00:13:32,787 --> 00:13:35,888
[SPEAKER_09]: But then come July 11th, Orange Lounge Radio will be back.

260
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:36,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You said it.

261
00:13:36,469 --> 00:13:39,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And it'll be something like this when Orange Lounge Radio is back on the 11th.

262
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:58,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, starring Rob Roberts, Loki, and featuring... No, no, no, no.

263
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,481
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Rob.

264
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:00,722
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do the right thing.

265
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:02,203
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to play the bionic level.

266
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know that's seriously what I got my name after?

267
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:08,788
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know.

268
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:09,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

269
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:18,034
[SPEAKER_04]: See, totally... I want to be all bionic and have the little string quartet follow me around every time I run.

270
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:20,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

271
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:33,449
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

272
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:38,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Spyro's in our chat room saying, even though I'm British, I still celebrate the 4th.

273
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Stick it to the king!

274
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,472
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's kind of like feeding a cow a hamburger, but okay.

275
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:48,592
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

276
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:50,793
[SPEAKER_04]: It's double the beef.

277
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

278
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,053
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's what caused mad cow disease.

279
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:53,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet.

280
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:54,234
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

281
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:54,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you mad?

282
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:55,574
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

283
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're fit for food.

284
00:14:57,034 --> 00:14:59,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Occasionally on this program, we talk about video games.

285
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

286
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:12,248
[SPEAKER_10]: It was okay, I actually played some different stuff this week because I am being forced to sit on a jury Oh crap, did you get picked?

287
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:21,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I got picked Joke's on them actually Alright, we're gonna ask you all about the case when it's done, it's still going right?

288
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:23,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

289
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I know you can't talk about it.

290
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:31,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can't, but... Actually, you want to get dismissed real quick?

291
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:32,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's your form.

292
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:33,627
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you better not.

293
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,347
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not dismiss, that's contempt.

294
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,810
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're doing the interview, she'll go, I support killing them!

295
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,293
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay because Inspector Gadget can get you out of jail.

296
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:50,862
[SPEAKER_10]: It wouldn't be so bad if it was a criminal trial, but no, it's a civil trial.

297
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:54,366
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, somebody is mad and so they're suing for money.

298
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:56,768
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what's going on.

299
00:15:58,088 --> 00:16:02,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I kid you not, I couldn't roll my eyes more than at this trial.

300
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,253
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, the prosecution lawyer is an idiot who talks like Andy Griffith and it's hilarious.

301
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:13,254
[SPEAKER_09]: So is the case anything like this when you're in the courtroom?

302
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:19,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, you'll just kind of be sitting there and then, you know, now the prosecution is going to call a witness to the stand.

303
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:23,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

304
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:47,296
[SPEAKER_10]: and a loudspeaker PA system because they were confused.

305
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:52,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I should say the prosecution lawyer was confused and we were falling asleep.

306
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we finally had our afternoon break.

307
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:02,902
[SPEAKER_10]: We all walked out into the hallway and just kind of looked at each other and shook our heads like, this is going to last until November.

308
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:04,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

309
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:07,024
[SPEAKER_10]: You got the lawyer who watched too much Matlock.

310
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:08,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

311
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:10,805
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy is like, it's seriously Andy Griffith.

312
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:13,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Get his autograph for me.

313
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:18,437
[SPEAKER_10]: He introduced himself as, okay, I'm going to screw up people's names.

314
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:19,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to forget things.

315
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to repeat stuff.

316
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:24,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to get confused.

317
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:26,599
[SPEAKER_10]: But don't hold that against my client.

318
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,459
[SPEAKER_09]: How much did you pay for this guy?

319
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, at least he's modest.

320
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw wants to know.

321
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably court appointed.

322
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw in our chat room wants to know if the case is a little more like night court.

323
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:42,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say it's more night court than law and order.

324
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:44,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh god, look out for Bull Great

325
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:55,671
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got Inspector Gadget, we've got Night Court, I don't know, I dread what might be coming for me, but that's alright.

326
00:17:56,071 --> 00:18:17,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so because I've had to endure court, I've been playing a lot of stuff on my DS, including Peggle Nights, which is pretty fun, and of course some Planet Puzzle League, and I actually played a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 2.

327
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:35,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Chinatown Wars, but I gotta say man, Chinatown Wars, I just don't dig the 2D, well not really 2D, the top down old school Grand Theft Auto stuff I mean, once you've been spoiled by number 3 and beyond, it's just, why go back?

328
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:42,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I will admit, I don't think I ever played more DS than when I had Jury Duty, so I feel ya

329
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just so terrible.

330
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:49,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have to go there at like 7 in the morning to get a parking spot.

331
00:18:49,598 --> 00:18:56,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Because our jury parking lot is in downtown Sacramento where there's no parking.

332
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there are dickholes that don't provide adequate parking for the jury.

333
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:04,382
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to get there that early in order to get parking.

334
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:07,823
[SPEAKER_10]: And then our trial doesn't actually start until 9 a.m.

335
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:08,783
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sitting there...

336
00:19:09,423 --> 00:19:10,284
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

337
00:19:30,862 --> 00:19:35,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, okay, but anyways, other than that, um, I've been playing more Grand Theft Auto, of course.

338
00:19:35,706 --> 00:19:44,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I made back, I guess, um, the ranks that I lost from playing some sloppy games.

339
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:53,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I've been taking it on my coworkers, so I've been beating the crap out of them very viciously, uh, quadrupling their scores at times.

340
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:53,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

341
00:19:55,139 --> 00:20:21,220
[SPEAKER_10]: and then what else Earth Defense Force 2017 because that game is still fun finished the the hardest difficulty on that so it's fun so we're going backwards now playing around the Genocide Gun and then I actually played a little bit of the Crackdown 2 demo hopefully going to be playing the full game by the end of this week I just have to convince them to give me my copy because they've been sitting on it for two weeks and

342
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:23,962
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, it's pretty fun.

343
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:31,347
[SPEAKER_10]: And Crackdown 2, pretty much just like you remember the first one, it's kind of cool if you've actually played the first game, you'll recognize a lot of the stuff in the game.

344
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,609
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of the locations are very similar, if not the same.

345
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:40,173
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I was just kind of walking around going, wow, hey, I recognize, oh my god, I wonder if this is here from the first game.

346
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:41,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, it is, there it is.

347
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:42,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of fun.

348
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,536
[SPEAKER_10]: And the game itself, you know, pretty cool.

349
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:49,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't wait to pick that up and actually play some maybe co-op online and whatnot.

350
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:53,625
[SPEAKER_10]: but yeah, that's pretty much it for right now

351
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see my gaming week then if we move on to me.

352
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a whole lot of new stuff.

353
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still making my way through Alan Wake.

354
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,004
[SPEAKER_09]: One of these days I'll beat it.

355
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:08,668
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did spend quite a bit of time on WoW this week, you know, addict, which I'll come back to in a minute.

356
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:19,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I also played a little bit of Game Room because, you know, I love me some classic games, and one of my all-time favorite classic games came out on Game Room this week, H-E-R-O, from the Atari 2600.

357
00:21:19,735 --> 00:21:24,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I played this a little more on the Commodore 64 with the slightly better graphics, but, you know, it's still the same game I remember.

358
00:21:25,439 --> 00:21:30,242
[SPEAKER_09]: In a nutshell, the H-E-R-O, it's helicopter rescue operation, basically.

359
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:35,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And you play this little guy that has a helicopter on his back, and it's this cute little control mechanism.

360
00:21:35,485 --> 00:21:43,289
[SPEAKER_09]: And you kind of explore caves, but in the cave there are monsters and lava and all these things you have to avoid, and sometimes boats that you take.

361
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:47,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, for a 2600 game, it was pretty darn impressive.

362
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they really packed a lot into the cartridge.

363
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:53,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I would kind of compare it to, like, imagine if you could fly around in Pitfall.

364
00:21:54,255 --> 00:22:22,780
[SPEAKER_09]: it's kind of like that because you know Pitfall was an Activision game too but it was one of my favorite games that came out for the 2600 but it came out right before the big crash so I think a lot of people missed this game but it's on Game Room now and you know it's worth at least checking out the demo and see if you like it I tried to get a top 20 score but I found it was very scary how much I remembered like go down through the left tunnel instead of the right tunnel or go down the third passage like I actually remembered how to get through a lot of levels it kind of freaked me out so yeah there was that that was fun

365
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:24,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank God.

366
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:53,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the Dungeon Finder.

367
00:22:58,095 --> 00:23:27,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It sprays diarrhea all over World of Warcraft It was a terrible content patch And I'll tell you why For one, now the game crashes every so often now If you have souped up settings on your computer The draw distance it can't handle Like my game crashes every now and then And the Ruby Sanctum I guess was released But it's not even open yet They can't open it until they get the patch deployed to everyone else They released this thing called Real ID

368
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:36,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Real ID is what allows you to cross communicate through servers, through factions to other players that you want to communicate with.

369
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:37,619
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I thought it was.

370
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,280
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of their way of being Xbox Live or Steam, I guess.

371
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:51,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know that Battle.net's kind of slowly trying to kind of poke at the Steam and the... Actually, I would say it's most... You know what most reminds me of is X-Fire.

372
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you remember X-Fire.

373
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:58,026
[SPEAKER_09]: But the whole way Battle.net's going really reminds me of what X-Fire kind of was or is, I guess.

374
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:58,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're still going.

375
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:03,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they kind of want to integrate the StarCraft 2 players that are going to be coming up with the WoW players.

376
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,809
[SPEAKER_09]: But Real ID, here's the thing.

377
00:24:06,784 --> 00:24:14,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Real ID allows you to communicate with players on any server and on any faction while you're still in WoW.

378
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:14,833
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's cool.

379
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:17,676
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't use handles.

380
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,398
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't use numbers.

381
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:23,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It uses your real name to communicate with other people.

382
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:25,938
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

383
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:51,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what I'm not okay with.

384
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:55,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is where I truly feel like Blizzard hijacked my privacy this week.

385
00:24:56,769 --> 00:25:07,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that they copied a feature from Xbox Live where you can view your friends list and you can go into any of your friends and view their friends list.

386
00:25:07,732 --> 00:25:09,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Complete with their real name.

387
00:25:10,732 --> 00:25:16,174
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, if I add a friend on this Battle.net system...

388
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:44,993
[SPEAKER_09]: somebody that might be trying to find out my real name because I don't know if it's a big secret or what have you but I don't use my real name on this program neither does Jamie Loki obviously isn't his real name either you know we use fake names on the show just like a lot of people do out there in the world like you know Bono that's not his real name Cher is probably a shortened name Madonna really is her name but you know it's you know what I mean Cher is actually Cher's name

389
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:47,795
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not trying to, well, but it's a shortened, she goes by one.

390
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:49,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought she was Esther now.

391
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:50,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

392
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:54,241
[SPEAKER_09]: My point is, there's a lot of people out there that don't use their real names, and we don't either.

393
00:25:54,881 --> 00:26:01,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know what, I actually thank Travis, back from Under Sedation Live, for making me use a fake name, because it's been really good.

394
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:05,430
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't like my day job and my night job to conflict.

395
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:13,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing personal, you guys, but just realize, I have a day job where I, privacy is a huge component of my day job.

396
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:29,024
[SPEAKER_09]: and I can't have my what I do during the day and what I do during the night conflict with each other and like if that were to happen I couldn't do this show anymore because I have to pay my bills you know what I mean this show pays me nothing so I realize that most people are pretty respectful of that

397
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:31,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Battle.net

398
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:53,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't control adding you as a friend, but I can't control who you put on your friends list.

399
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not going to put anybody on there.

400
00:26:55,827 --> 00:26:56,568
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't understand.

401
00:26:57,288 --> 00:27:01,992
[SPEAKER_09]: You might think that, and you might know that, but there's some really messed up people in the world.

402
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:08,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I, many years ago, because of this program, had a stalker.

403
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:10,398
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a stalker because of Orange Lounge Radio.

404
00:27:11,513 --> 00:27:12,334
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

405
00:27:41,738 --> 00:27:42,258
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

406
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:30,301
[SPEAKER_09]: that's that that's what I'm talking about and so I I am totally with you guys if you don't like it don't use it and I don't use it because I don't want that to happen ever again but the problem is it's there and now there's these social pressures and I'm hearing like guilds out there are requiring people to use it that is so screwed up here's my point Blizzard is smarter than that

407
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:31,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Bet your ass.

408
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:32,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Bet your ass.

409
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:59,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Think, when you were 16 or 17, did your parents know how to totally control your gaming?

410
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:00,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'll tell you, mine sure didn't.

411
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:02,885
[SPEAKER_09]: And it definitely wasn't because they were bad parents.

412
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:05,867
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just because I knew computers more than they did.

413
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:10,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing Nintendo with my mom.

414
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:19,374
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if World of Warcraft had been around when I was 16, I guarantee you I would be on Battle.net using real ID with my mom's name.

415
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:23,655
[SPEAKER_09]: That's... Like, I'm like, this is, like, incredibly messed up.

416
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:30,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So, basically, Blizzard failed to account for the stupidity and maliciousness of its players.

417
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:30,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.

418
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:34,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, potential stupidity and maliciousness of its players.

419
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Guilds requiring that?

420
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've heard... That is insane!

421
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they want to know if you're, like, online and to rate... It's these really stupid reasons.

422
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not join a guild that requires you to use real ID.

423
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:48,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's just... That's just, like...

424
00:29:50,865 --> 00:30:17,942
[SPEAKER_09]: or you can do what I do and don't play World of Warcraft so Star Trek Online, they don't require you to have that stuff I know, I'm trying to look at some of the comments in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to join in Salacious Pop says it only takes one person in an IRL guild to add random pickup people to ruin it for everybody else they know that's true, you know, I can control my own list but I can't control my friends list and that's what I really don't like about Real ID

425
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:27,588
[SPEAKER_09]: So honestly, I understand Blizzard, in a boardroom somewhere, must have thought this was a good idea to combat, I don't know, gold sellers or something.

426
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:29,390
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

427
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,151
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I can't think of why this is a good idea.

428
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:31,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I really can't.

429
00:30:32,572 --> 00:30:33,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hopefully they'll tone that down.

430
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:46,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize we have people, and I'm surprised every week at who is actually listening to Orange Lounge Radio, because like, didn't we have a guy email or call that was like, oh yeah, I worked at Infinity Ward, you know, I was there, I was like, really?

431
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know we had people that worked there to listen to the show.

432
00:30:50,172 --> 00:30:58,596
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have anyone that works at Act of Blizzard that listens to this program, will you please, please help us get this fixed?

433
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:02,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it is just an embarrassment to World of Warcraft right now.

434
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:10,439
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it makes about as much sense as locking down your Facebook privacy settings, and I think they need to do the same thing.

435
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:20,165
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they tried to make Battle.net a little more social, a little more Facebook-like, but they stumbled on the same problem that Facebook had.

436
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Privacy.

437
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:24,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing friends of friends that you might not want to see.

438
00:31:24,388 --> 00:31:28,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I keep my Facebook locked down tighter than a frog's ass for a reason.

439
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:33,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, if they want to go the Facebook route, though, Facebook lets me change my name.

440
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:38,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I use my radio name on Facebook because I actually don't want to date people to find out my name.

441
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just crazy.

442
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:47,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to say it's a dual life I live because I have one life, but I'm just very conscious about my internet trail, and I think you have to be in this day and age.

443
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,425
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find the easiest way to separate your internet trail is to use two names.

444
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,767
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very easy when you do it that way.

445
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, actually, I am going to tell you this.

446
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:58,711
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason why I leave my actual name up there is because I'm looking to get hired.

447
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:01,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and I don't need that right now.

448
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:02,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm marketing myself.

449
00:32:03,435 --> 00:32:07,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's got their own reasons for it.

450
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:14,345
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, Facebook has this thing in their little rules or whatever that says if they find out that you're using a pseudonym that they can't delete your account.

451
00:32:16,528 --> 00:32:21,930
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, TigerClaw in chat says, if Blizzard listens to this show, they need to pay attention.

452
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Sky is their biggest customer.

453
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:33,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the sentiment, and usually I'm one of the biggest proponents of Blizzard, but people that actually get suckered into going to BlizzCon are much bigger customers than I am.

454
00:32:33,773 --> 00:32:35,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, I think you're kind of a sucker if you go to BlizzCon.

455
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:41,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's people I know and love that go to BlizzCon, and it's, you know, it's just my personal feeling.

456
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:46,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and that's the whole thing, is that, you know, it's not like Blizzard doesn't get enough money out of you.

457
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:50,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you come attend for $150 this three-day commercial?

458
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:50,958
[SPEAKER_07]: No, thanks.

459
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:52,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to be able to afford your next expansion.

460
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:53,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

461
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:54,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

462
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,220
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what BlizzCon basically rolls down to.

463
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather just play your damn game.

464
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

465
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

466
00:32:58,661 --> 00:33:01,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm getting way off topic and there's people that really don't want to hear this whole spiel.

467
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:07,183
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just saying, I think this is important to talk about for a lot of different games.

468
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:10,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, Blizzard sets the standard with a lot of things.

469
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,745
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one scary-ass standard I don't want them setting.

470
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:35,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't complain about Xbox Live because I can change my name on Xbox Live I don't complain about Facebook because I can change my name on Facebook and I can lock it down to quote the ever eloquent Drunami tighter than a frog's ass I cannot change my name on Blizzard they hijacked it from my credit card without truly telling me what they would be using my name for and that was wrong that was wrong okay

471
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:37,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, rant's done.

472
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:38,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy show.

473
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:39,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, OLR.

474
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:40,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, happy show.

475
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:43,469
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Drew Nami, what have you been playing?

476
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God, hell is my gaming year.

477
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, in a nutshell, what have you been playing lately?

478
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:49,332
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing a whole crap load of WoW lately.

479
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:52,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I've actually been getting into the raiding scene, staying in the raiding scene.

480
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:58,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, I imagine Arthas is just sitting on his throne like Conan, looking bored.

481
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:00,336
[SPEAKER_07]: RP Guild.

482
00:34:01,836 --> 00:34:12,721
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've also been taking advantage of a lot of Steam sales, I am a consumer whore and how I'm buying a hell of a lot of Steam games, playing a hell of a lot of Steam games Oh, have you seen the sale this week?

483
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:24,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh god, I did take advantage of Left 4 Dead 2 Civ 4 is on sale again today No, I took advantage of Left 4 Dead 2 two days ago Yesterday, they cut the price in half

484
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:26,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you hate that?

485
00:34:26,248 --> 00:34:26,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And I raged.

486
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:29,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve is like gambling sometimes.

487
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,531
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I shot zombies.

488
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:31,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy low.

489
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:32,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I shot zombies.

490
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I have been really getting into the Mass Effect series.

491
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I played through Mass Effect 2 for the past couple months.

492
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:43,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Love the hell out of it, waiting for the third game in the trilogy.

493
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:47,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta jump in here real quick because this is a very important question in chat I want to answer.

494
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:55,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Blaze in our chatroom says, is this real ID nonsense going to be in StarCraft 2 and or more importantly to me at least, Diablo 3?

495
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

496
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:05,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why even if you don't play WoW, Blizzard has a lock on some other PC gaming and I think it's important that you check that.

497
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:07,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Check it out.

498
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:09,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why they rushed this patch.

499
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:12,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because StarCraft 2 is hitting shelves, what, next week?

500
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:12,991
[SPEAKER_09]: July 27th.

501
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I thought it was like July 7th.

502
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:15,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but soon.

503
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:16,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So they had to implement the patch.

504
00:35:17,017 --> 00:35:17,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry, Drunami.

505
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:21,183
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to get that out there because it's a very important question that needed answering from our chat room.

506
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:28,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, lots of Mass Effect 2, lots of Killing Fool, a very underrated first-person shooter.

507
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:30,559
[SPEAKER_07]: It's no Left 4 Dead, but it's definitely underrated.

508
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Console-wise, not a whole lot.

509
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:41,586
[SPEAKER_07]: The new Tales Symphonia sequel was good, I've been replaying that.

510
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:43,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally got around to beating No More Heroes.

511
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,740
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

512
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,494
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a lot of bugs for the PC port though.

513
00:36:05,654 --> 00:36:07,717
[SPEAKER_07]: The PC port wasn't very good.

514
00:36:08,258 --> 00:36:12,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, it was still a fun game, just not as fun.

515
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:17,030
[SPEAKER_07]: I was playing Trine, not Twine, Trine.

516
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:18,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Had a lot of fun with that.

517
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I want your money as well Give it to me

518
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:45,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan is here in studio.

519
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:47,253
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't hear him because he's not on a mic, but that's okay.

520
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:47,953
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, Dan?

521
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:49,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings.

522
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Since you decided to bless our show.

523
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:55,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to talk about games, but I want a moment of your show's time.

524
00:36:55,938 --> 00:37:04,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I want everyone to have a very, very brief moment of silence to mourn the passing of Game Crazy this week.

525
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:08,226
[SPEAKER_12]: As of Wednesday, all Game Crazies will close down.

526
00:37:08,746 --> 00:37:09,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't Wednesday our birthday?

527
00:37:10,387 --> 00:37:11,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Leaving me super unemployed.

528
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:13,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Wednesday was our birthday.

529
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:14,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, LLR!

530
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:15,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy birthday, LLR!

531
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,751
[SPEAKER_12]: So, everybody, send me your money.

532
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:21,234
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not worried about identity.

533
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:23,175
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to send me some money, I'll just give you my name.

534
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:24,136
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Rob.

535
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:29,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob.

536
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:31,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Send your money to Rob.

537
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:32,744
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll get it to me.

538
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, send Rob your money.

539
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be sure Dan gets all of it.

540
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:38,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to send cash.

541
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:41,661
[SPEAKER_12]: because if you want his real name and address, what number of the works?

542
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:42,141
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it.

543
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:42,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, shut up.

544
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:44,183
[SPEAKER_12]: I will hook you up.

545
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,905
[SPEAKER_04]: In related topics, Dan will never be added to Battle.net.

546
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:49,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Every Sunday.

547
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:51,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I know right where he's at.

548
00:37:51,508 --> 00:37:53,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this.

549
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:57,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Dan, you're ignoring OLR tonight to partake in the Mario Marathon, correct?

550
00:37:58,448 --> 00:37:59,049
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not really.

551
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:03,292
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if I was ignoring all, I would be talking to you.

552
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:04,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you were a minute ago.

553
00:38:04,572 --> 00:38:06,374
[SPEAKER_09]: You were on the couch and watching Mario Marathon.

554
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:07,715
[SPEAKER_09]: How's Mario Marathon going?

555
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:10,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Those guys are not very good Mario players.

556
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:12,798
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's for a good cause.

557
00:38:12,818 --> 00:38:13,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, it's for a good cause.

558
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:16,101
[SPEAKER_04]: We were actually sort of talking about that we should do something like that.

559
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:17,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Except you play Sonic.

560
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:20,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Except for, you know, something awesome.

561
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:30,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, TigerClaw's got a great suggestion in our chatroom at chat.orange.radio.com Maybe Dan can be on OLR more often now that he's jobless and he can tell game crazy stories.

562
00:38:30,486 --> 00:38:31,667
[SPEAKER_12]: I never worked on Sunday.

563
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I just didn't want to talk to y'all.

564
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:38,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I live with him, so I'm going to be on medical leave while he's off.

565
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:44,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, one of you two is going to kill the other because you're both not going to be working.

566
00:38:46,177 --> 00:38:47,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, tell me about it.

[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do Paper Plate Battle Royale again.

569
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:21,756
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about?

570
00:39:23,036 --> 00:39:27,858
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I just saw something that makes me incredibly excited for my big DS9 fangirlism.

571
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:34,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode 2 for Star Trek Online is going to be launching on July 15th.

572
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:36,882
[SPEAKER_04]: They're including mini-games and one of them is Dabo.

573
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:40,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Ranma in chat says Dan should apply to Best Buy.

574
00:39:41,403 --> 00:39:41,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no.

575
00:39:42,143 --> 00:39:44,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I was waiting for a comment from the living room.

576
00:39:44,864 --> 00:39:45,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan!

577
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:47,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they hiring?

578
00:39:47,905 --> 00:39:52,127
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think he values his soul that much.

579
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:52,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

580
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:53,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

581
00:39:53,427 --> 00:39:54,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, Tigerclaw!

582
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:55,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Brilliant!

583
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:01,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan can try to sign in to be a contestant in the latest season of The Tester.

584
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:05,318
[SPEAKER_09]: that show that they're casting for season two of The Tester.

585
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan should go on The Tester.

586
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:13,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, every other thing he says would be, you know, and I play this beep game, beep, beep, beep game, beep.

587
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:15,303
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a brilliant idea.

588
00:40:15,443 --> 00:40:15,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan!

589
00:40:15,903 --> 00:40:17,584
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

590
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:19,544
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to go on reality television.

591
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:22,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I was on reality television.

592
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,827
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're going to put you on season two of The Tester.

593
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:27,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, you're on reality radio now.

594
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:32,639
[SPEAKER_09]: No one listens to this show and no one watches The Tester.

595
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,840
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be a perfect transition.

596
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Chirp, chirp.

597
00:40:35,281 --> 00:40:35,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Chirp, chirp.

598
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:36,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Dan's back.

599
00:40:36,382 --> 00:40:36,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray.

600
00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:37,563
[SPEAKER_09]: My yelling worked.

601
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,906
[SPEAKER_09]: The Tester, you know that reality show on PlayStation Network?

602
00:40:40,946 --> 00:40:42,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Season 2 is coming up.

603
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:43,868
[SPEAKER_12]: There's shows on PlayStation Network?

604
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:44,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you could be.

605
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:47,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Is PlayStation Network where you go on when you're not on Xbox Live?

606
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:47,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

607
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:50,894
[SPEAKER_09]: There's actually going to have this whole plus thing soon, too.

608
00:40:50,934 --> 00:40:51,494
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

609
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:56,699
[SPEAKER_12]: The only reason I want to go on PlayStation Network is what is that new game that looks like Strider but it's four players?

610
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,365
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, but it's amazing.

611
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:02,306
[SPEAKER_12]: You could be a Sony game tester.

612
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:05,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony games kind of suck.

613
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:07,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't screw yourself.

614
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:09,950
[SPEAKER_09]: $10,000 to the winner.

615
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:11,811
[SPEAKER_23]: Necromashina.

616
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,352
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not really that much money.

617
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:14,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Necromashina.

618
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:15,833
[SPEAKER_12]: You should check that out.

619
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,853
[SPEAKER_12]: That game looks awesome.

620
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,134
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on PlayStation Network.

621
00:41:18,354 --> 00:41:19,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you playing Mario Crossover?

622
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:27,751
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so good, it's got Ryu in it now I set mine up to work with my gamepad It's rad to the max

623
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:32,207
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've been playing Mario Crossover this week.

624
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,568
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've still been playing Mario Bros.

625
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:35,309
[SPEAKER_12]: X. There's my week in gaming.

626
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,831
[SPEAKER_12]: And I finished Red Dead Redemption and it was sad at the end.

627
00:41:38,572 --> 00:41:38,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

628
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:39,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

629
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:40,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Jimmy wants this game too.

630
00:41:40,673 --> 00:41:40,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

631
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:42,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Jimmy wants everything.

632
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:42,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

633
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:44,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I got no money.

634
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:45,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan, good luck to you.

635
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:46,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you send me some.

636
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:48,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Send me money so I can buy my wife games.

637
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:49,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck to you in the job search.

638
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, is this done by the same guy that did Strider?

639
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:52,621
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a hard worker.

640
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:53,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone loves it.

641
00:41:53,622 --> 00:41:58,686
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we have people that listen to this show that knew you from your store.

642
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:02,368
[SPEAKER_09]: that was like, oh my god, Jamie's married to the guy at that store.

643
00:42:02,748 --> 00:42:05,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie's married to that big jerk who works at Funkoland.

644
00:42:07,051 --> 00:42:08,072
[SPEAKER_12]: That poor woman.

645
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:10,773
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys don't know what it's like here.

646
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:12,434
[SPEAKER_12]: She's insane.

647
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:13,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

648
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:15,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

649
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:16,677
[SPEAKER_09]: We gotta get into gaming news.

650
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:17,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dan.

651
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:17,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

652
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:21,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Housekeeping and things that are coming up.

653
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:23,922
[SPEAKER_09]: No show next week.

654
00:42:23,962 --> 00:42:24,902
[SPEAKER_09]: We already talked about that.

655
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I want to mention this real quick.

656
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:32,875
[SPEAKER_09]: IOS 4 is out, which is the iPhone thing, iPad software.

657
00:42:33,276 --> 00:42:37,381
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that's new in the IOS 4, and I'm not just talking about the iPhone 4.

658
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:43,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yes, that's out too, but we realize a lot of people listen to this show on their iPhones, their iPods, their iTouches.

659
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,012
[SPEAKER_09]: There's other devices too, we are aware.

660
00:42:46,112 --> 00:42:48,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people just listen straight up on their PC and that's cool.

661
00:42:48,494 --> 00:42:56,120
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the new things in iOS 4 is that the show descriptions are actually now displayed on the screen while you listen to the podcast.

662
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to try in a couple weeks something new with the notes for the show and we think you'll really like it.

663
00:43:02,565 --> 00:43:05,968
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're going to be kind of expanded and time stamped.

664
00:43:06,348 --> 00:43:07,609
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to try something new.

665
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:33,731
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're hoping you guys will like it but that'll be in two weeks on the podcast or really the next podcast that'll hit the feed after this one so we hope you guys like it it's gonna take more work that goes into it though so all right appreciate it yeah I think people will like it it's kind of been a requested feature for a while so we'll see what happens all right anyhow we're only 45 minutes into the show and I barely touched gaming news how about some video game news we'll start off tonight with the one and only Loki

666
00:43:34,747 --> 00:43:39,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so it's been confirmed that the 3DS is coming out in 2011.

667
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:50,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, of course, before Reggie actually appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show, yes, apparently Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is now a news source.

668
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:56,456
[SPEAKER_10]: It was announced that the 3DS would be out in fiscal 2010.

669
00:43:57,077 --> 00:43:57,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that's fiscal 2010.

670
00:44:00,758 --> 00:44:20,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Which would be between now and March 31st, 2011 But now it's been confirmed that it's actually going to launch in 2011 So, do the math, it's going to be the first three months of the year And, yeah, that's neat, I guess

671
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:30,532
[SPEAKER_10]: hmm kind of disappointing I guess if you're looking forward to it for Christmas but hey there's enough crap coming out during Christmas one less thing I can deal with that

672
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:37,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally agree that it's very strange that Jimmy Fallon has now become this kind of launching point for games.

673
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:40,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I guess it was actually part of like a week of games or something.

674
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:42,525
[SPEAKER_09]: He does games a lot on his show.

675
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:45,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you watched the clip, but Reggie kind of takes a jab.

676
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:50,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's Sony because he says something about... And it's not like the guys that were here last night.

677
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:52,169
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need glasses to see this 3D.

678
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:53,689
[SPEAKER_09]: He said something like that in the clip.

679
00:44:54,229 --> 00:44:57,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was just Reggie being Reggie, you know.

680
00:44:58,311 --> 00:44:58,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

681
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:07,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, kind of a bummer, though, that it's not coming out until 2011, but I totally won a bet with GamerEaty, and now I'm getting a lunch bot for me.

682
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:10,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So, GamerEaty, if you're listening, I like steak.

683
00:45:11,038 --> 00:45:11,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

684
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,239
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just kidding.

685
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:13,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.

686
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm actually not kidding.

687
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:15,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I did win a bet.

688
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:21,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think it was intended, maybe, for Reggie to say this on the show?

689
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:23,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this seems like an odd place.

690
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:25,643
[SPEAKER_09]: to give details about the release date?

691
00:45:25,663 --> 00:45:26,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you think it just kind of slipped?

692
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:28,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it slipped.

693
00:45:28,544 --> 00:45:37,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's just that people, when they announced fiscal 2010, and people were like, oh my god, by the end of 2010, woo!

694
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:50,092
[SPEAKER_10]: And so instead of just everybody being disappointed by figuring out that, hey, it's not coming out at holiday, he just went ahead and announced it so that you don't have to assume anymore.

695
00:45:52,262 --> 00:45:53,543
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think this leaves for?

696
00:45:53,563 --> 00:46:05,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Because a lot of people were speculating that 3DS and on our nightly shows from E3 too, I know Shane and I were having some discussions on this, that the 3DS really had to come out this year because what else does Nintendo have for Christmas?

697
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:09,880
[SPEAKER_09]: So what do you think the holiday season is going to look like for Nintendo?

698
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,882
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be all their games.

699
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:37,163
[SPEAKER_10]: The Kirby and the Donkey Kong Not everything, I mean Donkey Kong I think and Kirby are going to be this year I think Kirby is going to be the one that's in November There's a lot of stuff I think for October There's also a lot of stuff that they haven't announced Or announced last year Stuff that was shown on E3 last year is coming out I know there's a game on the Wii I can't remember if it was the Wii or DS It was one of the ones I saw last year though

700
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:40,548
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so there's still stuff to come out.

701
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:44,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Never lied to me, I can't remember the timeline for, uh, was it Metroid Other M?

702
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:46,537
[SPEAKER_09]: It's August 31st.

703
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:50,803
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to be out a couple days ago, because I remember it was my birthday weekend.

704
00:46:50,843 --> 00:46:51,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, today.

705
00:46:51,324 --> 00:46:53,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was supposed to be out today, but it got pushed back.

706
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that'll be a Christmas gift idea.

707
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:57,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.

708
00:46:57,512 --> 00:46:58,333
[SPEAKER_09]: That came out instead.

709
00:46:58,993 --> 00:46:59,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you checked that out?

710
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:00,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

711
00:47:00,874 --> 00:47:01,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I have not played it yet.

712
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:03,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't really play the first one, to be honest.

713
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:05,277
[SPEAKER_09]: My Wii is still not hooked up.

714
00:47:05,877 --> 00:47:09,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I will probably not be hooking it up until Metroid Other M comes out, because I've got to play that.

715
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:13,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to play Metroid Other M. It does look cool.

716
00:47:14,403 --> 00:47:19,806
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, I haven't played the Wii console since...

717
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:25,078
[SPEAKER_09]: November, I think?

718
00:47:25,418 --> 00:47:28,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Some comments in our chatroom about Pokemon Black White.

719
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:32,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Spyro in our chat is asking, is Pokemon Black and White cancelled?

720
00:47:32,947 --> 00:47:36,370
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I believe they even announced a release date.

721
00:47:36,511 --> 00:47:38,032
[SPEAKER_09]: October 19th in Japan.

722
00:47:38,373 --> 00:47:39,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't it even sooner than that?

723
00:47:39,434 --> 00:47:41,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the 18th of September, I thought I read?

724
00:47:41,716 --> 00:47:43,098
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was October, I think.

725
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:44,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Regardless, it's fall in Japan.

726
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:59,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Fall of Japan So it won't have 3DS support I bet you anything it'll be out April in the US because that's usually when they've been releasing the Pokemon games around the April time frame

727
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:02,478
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, we'll see if you're right or not.

728
00:48:03,038 --> 00:48:03,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's true.

729
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,700
[SPEAKER_09]: This last little one with the Pokey Walker ball came out in April-ish.

730
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,561
[SPEAKER_09]: That was March.

731
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:08,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it?

732
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:08,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

733
00:48:08,921 --> 00:48:10,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, it was right before PAX East.

734
00:48:10,582 --> 00:48:12,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody had one of those stupid things there.

735
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:15,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Pokemon HeartGold, SoulSilver, that was March.

736
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:17,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon Platinum was March.

737
00:48:18,226 --> 00:48:23,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Pokemon Explorers of the Sky and Explorers of Time, that was April.

738
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Diamond Pearl was April.

739
00:48:29,545 --> 00:48:31,487
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, it's usually March or April.

740
00:48:45,844 --> 00:48:47,044
[SPEAKER_09]: The 3DS cards are a little bigger.

741
00:48:47,185 --> 00:48:47,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it won't matter.

742
00:48:47,745 --> 00:48:48,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

743
00:48:48,866 --> 00:48:51,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be like the advanced dungeons in Zelda.

744
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:52,028
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I think of.

745
00:48:52,288 --> 00:48:54,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that they're... They might.

746
00:48:54,449 --> 00:48:58,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's... I would say, if anything, it's going to have DSi support.

747
00:48:58,412 --> 00:48:59,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not 3DS.

748
00:48:59,933 --> 00:49:06,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It might have some really silly stuff, like the whole game won't be in 3D, but maybe like the evolution scenes or something silly.

749
00:49:06,097 --> 00:49:08,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like little one-off things will be in 3D.

750
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:08,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Little, little things.

751
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:09,559
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

752
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,640
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

753
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:16,344
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason why is because they're going to be in the old carts and it's going to be too hard to hold that extra data on there.

754
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:20,187
[SPEAKER_10]: But DSI support's been something that they've been doing a lot with different games.

755
00:49:20,387 --> 00:49:26,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily, you know, you don't have to play it on the DSI, but if you do, you can, you know, do different things.

756
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Also some other comments in chat.

757
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:33,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma is a big fan of the 3DS, saying, I will get a 3DS and I will shank someone if I have to.

758
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:34,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of people feel that way, actually.

759
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:38,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee is trying to top us all, saying, I haven't played my Wii since 2008.

760
00:49:40,836 --> 00:49:44,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious, though, if Frisbee's going to break it out for anything that Nintendo announced this year.

761
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:54,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play Wii Sports Golf on Friday because they were setting up something for some company that we had coming into our work.

762
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:56,465
[SPEAKER_10]: They were having a Wii Sports Golf tournament.

763
00:49:56,485 --> 00:49:58,706
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think day job stuff should count, though, to be honest.

764
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in that case, then I don't play Grand Theft Auto ever.

765
00:50:02,388 --> 00:50:05,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, you do that on your break, though, but I get what you're saying.

766
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, technically it wasn't working if I'm playing Wii Sports Golf.

767
00:50:11,024 --> 00:50:11,965
[SPEAKER_10]: WeSportsResortGolf

768
00:50:34,818 --> 00:50:49,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft representative confirmed to them that a $199 version of their new Xbox 360, which they're now calling the short Xbox 360, or they put that in quotes, they're not calling it the Slim now, which is good, because we talked about this last week.

769
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:51,558
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not the Xbox 360 Slim, right?

770
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:52,860
[SPEAKER_09]: It has another name.

771
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so anyway, it is going to be coming out for $199.

772
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:04,503
[SPEAKER_09]: There is also a new setup that's going to have the Xbox 6 system and Kinect together, which I think a lot of people knew.

773
00:51:06,624 --> 00:51:10,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go, $199 Xbox 360 system coming out soon.

774
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:15,806
[SPEAKER_09]: No date, no idea, but probably what, fall-ish, I think you were predicting, Loki?

775
00:51:16,086 --> 00:51:17,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the holidays for sure.

776
00:51:17,686 --> 00:51:18,787
[SPEAKER_10]: For the new system?

777
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:19,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

778
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:26,949
[SPEAKER_10]: The new SKUs with the Kinect isn't coming out until when the Kinect does, so that'll be November 4th.

779
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:36,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you the $1.99 system, probably as early as September, just to cash in on Halo Reach.

780
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,842
[SPEAKER_09]: That's also when they've done price drops.

781
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:43,166
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were thinking about getting an Xbox right now, wait.

782
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:49,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, wait and see anyways because you know how they're saying that there's going to be a new $199 SKU?

783
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:51,275
[SPEAKER_10]: What if they're just dropping the price of the system to $199?

784
00:51:53,803 --> 00:52:21,045
[SPEAKER_10]: you never know I would think though if anything they do a lot of their price drops and big pushes towards the holiday and especially when they want to capitalize on a game like Halo Reach just wait for some better deals to be coming out and besides even if you wait longer what they've been doing in the past is bundling in some games with your Xbox 360 system for free so if you do wait you still might get some free stuff

785
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:25,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Catanagram in our chat room at chat.org.com is asking, Wait, how much is this bundle?

786
00:52:25,887 --> 00:52:26,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they say?

787
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:28,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I must know for Child of Eden.

788
00:52:28,568 --> 00:52:29,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's speculating, what, $300?

789
00:52:29,948 --> 00:52:30,669
[SPEAKER_09]: I think $300.

790
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:31,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

791
00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:34,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, $299 is what the system is right now.

792
00:52:35,651 --> 00:52:35,971
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be $399.

793
00:52:38,052 --> 00:52:38,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

794
00:52:39,332 --> 00:52:41,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if there'll be a basic version with Kinect, though.

795
00:52:41,493 --> 00:52:42,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet there is.

796
00:52:43,054 --> 00:52:43,474
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

797
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:44,054
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to say.

798
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,195
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're going to do...

799
00:52:47,386 --> 00:52:50,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, they could do a smaller hard drive because the hard drive is removable.

800
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:51,148
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.

801
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:52,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like the PS3.

802
00:52:54,109 --> 00:52:55,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, isn't that awesome?

803
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:56,571
[SPEAKER_10]: It is awesome.

804
00:52:57,211 --> 00:52:58,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Loki, how big is the hard drive?

805
00:52:58,852 --> 00:53:00,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to try to put a terabyte drive in there?

806
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:01,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not getting a new system.

807
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:02,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, you don't need one.

808
00:53:02,814 --> 00:53:04,315
[SPEAKER_09]: You have like five Xbox 360s.

809
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I had five Xbox 360s.

810
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:10,498
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many Xbox 360s I have anymore.

811
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:11,098
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

812
00:53:11,238 --> 00:53:11,839
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome though.

813
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:22,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking about the Xbox 360, it doesn't look like they're going to be getting Final Fantasy XIV because their system is so different.

814
00:53:23,387 --> 00:53:31,393
[SPEAKER_04]: They were wanting to play like a normal internet environment and wanted for the consoles to mirror how it works on the PC.

815
00:53:32,654 --> 00:53:37,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft has a closed environment so they still can't work up an agreement.

816
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:39,912
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

817
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:25,180
[SPEAKER_09]: but Final Fantasy XI I don't think it did that well on the 360 and I really don't have anything to base it off of but I'm just spec you know just kind of knowing who played it what systems they were playing on I don't think it did well on the 360 because most people who wanted to play it already had it on PS2 and PC you know what I mean

818
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that set a bad precedent for MMOs in general, but if that was the case, that seems kind of crappy to me.

819
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:35,645
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's one other MMO on Xbox 360 right now, and that's Phantasy Star Universe.

820
00:54:35,945 --> 00:54:37,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I don't think that did very well either.

821
00:54:41,307 --> 00:54:43,168
[SPEAKER_04]: They also were trying to get Champions Online.

822
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:46,010
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that the game ran just fine.

823
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the business end of getting everything in line.

824
00:54:51,176 --> 00:55:07,496
[SPEAKER_09]: it seems strange to me that Microsoft is kind of shooting themselves in the foot with these MMOs especially with Final Fantasy XIV and DC Universe both slated for the PS3 this fall I mean this could be where the PS3 has their own agency we know is coming out too what MMOs are on their way for 360?

825
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:09,318
[SPEAKER_09]: are there any at this point that we know of?

826
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:10,400
[SPEAKER_09]: no

827
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:15,382
[SPEAKER_07]: If any, they need a recent MMO like Final Fantasy XIV.

828
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:21,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if trends are to be believed, they got MMOs that were sort of past their prime.

829
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:21,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Or their...

830
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:53,944
[SPEAKER_09]: or they're turning their nose up at MMOs which you know they could get away with doing possibly MMOs have always you know Sony somewhat is I don't know if they're necessarily taking a risk but the developers are taking a risk putting the games out on PS3 but I don't know like again I really enjoy DC Universe on the PS3 that I played at E3 and I could see myself paying money for that on the PlayStation 3 if they succeed then Microsoft's gonna have to catch up

831
00:55:56,141 --> 00:55:56,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

832
00:55:56,421 --> 00:56:02,029
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems very strange to me that they would not be trying to bend over backwards to get Final Fantasy XIV on their system.

833
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,311
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe they're thinking, you know what?

834
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:06,095
[SPEAKER_09]: XI didn't do that great, so XIV's not going to either.

835
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea.

836
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Microsoft has their own agenda.

837
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:17,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Comment from SalaciousPop in chat, and this is something he was telling me about earlier today, and I want to share this with you guys too.

838
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:20,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Champions Online was developed for a 360 release.

839
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:26,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Even playing the PC version, you can see the 360 integration screaming at you from the UI.

840
00:56:26,598 --> 00:56:33,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Champions Online was a huge flop, and it probably has to do with the fact that at least 50% of its platform audience never actually got the game.

841
00:56:36,342 --> 00:56:36,882
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

842
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:46,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Champions Online maybe was unfortunately did in by this whole fact that the 360 was not going to be having its MMO or made it too difficult.

843
00:56:47,258 --> 00:56:47,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunate.

844
00:56:49,978 --> 00:56:52,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Bochikawa says PS3 is a free online service.

845
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:53,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Same on PC.

846
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,880
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Microsoft lost majorly because of that.

847
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:02,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, keep in mind, I can't remember for PSU, but I know for Final Fantasy XI, it would work with a silver account.

848
00:57:02,782 --> 00:57:03,583
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayOnline was never cool

849
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was cool when it first came out, but that was it.

850
00:57:25,978 --> 00:57:30,860
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyhow, the interesting thing, and PlayOnline is on the 360 version, but here's the crazy thing about PlayOnline.

851
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,602
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a joint venture between Square Enix and Sony.

852
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:41,144
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayOnline is a Sony code, and it was on the 360.

853
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy XI was a really not typical game on the 360.

854
00:57:48,824 --> 00:57:50,305
[SPEAKER_09]: It broke all the rules.

855
00:57:51,025 --> 00:57:53,307
[SPEAKER_09]: But they were excited to have a Final Fantasy game on their console.

856
00:57:53,427 --> 00:57:55,389
[SPEAKER_09]: They let it break the rules.

857
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:59,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like they let Castlevania break the rules and it ended up setting a precedent.

858
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:02,674
[SPEAKER_09]: With the whole Symphony of the Night coming out on the arcade.

859
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:08,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, in Japan, Symphony of the Night did come out on the Saturn.

860
00:58:10,114 --> 00:58:11,635
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that have to do with the 360 one, though?

861
00:58:12,036 --> 00:58:19,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, even back in the day, Sony didn't have the whole exclusive... I see.

862
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:25,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to have been exclusive, and then the Saturn version came out, which apparently had all the stuff that the programmers never got to put in.

863
00:58:25,946 --> 00:58:26,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

864
00:58:26,387 --> 00:58:26,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I getcha.

865
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:29,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

866
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:32,512
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be interesting to see what kind of comes of that.

867
00:58:32,532 --> 00:58:33,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Saturn version was better.

868
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:39,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, honestly, if you haven't heard of it by this point, Final Fantasy XIV will not be on the 360 release date anyway.

869
00:58:40,259 --> 00:58:42,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Can they add it the next year if the game becomes popular?

870
00:58:43,322 --> 00:58:43,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

871
00:58:44,183 --> 00:58:44,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

872
00:58:44,703 --> 00:58:44,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I...

873
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:47,399
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, guys.

874
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't.

875
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:52,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm just kind of like, there's just something about it.

876
00:58:53,003 --> 00:58:56,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a really bad feeling it's going to flop.

877
00:58:56,345 --> 00:58:57,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it is.

878
00:58:58,807 --> 00:59:07,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just because XI was so received mixed, and I don't think the PS3 is as adopted as the PS2 was, and the 360, I don't know.

879
00:59:07,974 --> 00:59:09,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Call me crazy.

880
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:13,258
[SPEAKER_10]: What's funny is there's still a Final Fantasy XIV skew on Xbox 360.

881
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:16,501
[SPEAKER_10]: It still exists, whether it's actually going to come out or not.

882
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:18,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it's a placeholder.

883
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:19,654
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, though?

884
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:22,995
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be a lot that they're developing that they don't plan on releasing.

885
00:59:23,035 --> 00:59:26,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe a 360 version is further along than any of us are giving credit for.

886
00:59:27,136 --> 00:59:33,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Because one other thing, I don't know if we talked about when we did the E3 report, but Final Fantasy XIV also supports 3D right now.

887
00:59:34,017 --> 00:59:37,038
[SPEAKER_09]: You can put on 3D glasses if you have those Uber monitors for your PC.

888
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:40,199
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play Final Fantasy XIV in 3D.

889
00:59:40,339 --> 00:59:43,560
[SPEAKER_09]: But they took great caution to tell us

890
00:59:44,520 --> 01:00:12,681
[SPEAKER_09]: we're messing with this right now we don't know if it's going to be in the full release this is a concept thing that you're seeing so who knows there Bochikawa in our chatroom says 14 will suck yes but it will still sell we'll see we'll see I again I hate to base my opinion off an early build of the game I do believe though I I think if 14 gets delayed to next year it's not bad news but that's just me anyhow Loki what do you got for us

891
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:26,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently there's a rumor coming from Bloomberg saying that Sony may close a deal securing the rights to bring Hulu to the PlayStation Network.

892
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:29,423
[SPEAKER_10]: It says the partnership could be announced as soon as next week.

893
01:00:30,304 --> 01:00:46,971
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's kind of interesting since you know apparently there's also a similar report saying that it might be coming to Xbox 360 and the iPad as well and would offer a premium Hulu service where you could possibly pay for maybe streaming of old

894
01:00:48,131 --> 01:01:14,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Archive stuff kind of interesting actually that they're thinking about bringing it to that platform I don't know I think it'll eventually probably make its way to each console platform except for the Wii maybe but why not you can kind of do it right now with well you could have done it before with the web browser you can do it with third party software like Diversity and stuff like that but I could definitely see this happening

895
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:22,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting that Hulu keeps coming up time and time again.

896
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,209
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, happen already, darn it.

897
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

898
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,352
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a matter of time.

899
01:01:31,893 --> 01:01:33,374
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just waiting to see what happens.

900
01:01:34,915 --> 01:01:41,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, something I really don't think you need to wait much longer to see if it happens or not has to do with the price of Kinect.

901
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:50,746
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what we've been saying, you know, as have most of the gaming press, that Kinect is going to cost you $150, but Microsoft, for whatever reason, just won't confirm it.

902
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:52,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they will not tell you the price of Kinect.

903
01:01:52,987 --> 01:01:53,768
[SPEAKER_09]: But then this week...

904
01:01:54,608 --> 01:01:56,369
[SPEAKER_09]: on the official Microsoft store.

905
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:57,529
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, online.

906
01:01:57,549 --> 01:02:00,650
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Microsoft has a store online just like Apple does and a lot of different companies do.

907
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:04,131
[SPEAKER_09]: They now are selling the Kinect sensor for the Xbox 360 for $149.99.

908
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:08,693
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

909
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:10,894
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like, what do we cost?

910
01:02:11,554 --> 01:02:13,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, interesting, huh?

911
01:02:13,615 --> 01:02:18,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope this comes with a bundle in-game because just $150 for the device itself.

912
01:02:19,417 --> 01:02:21,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It better come with a bundle of several games.

913
01:02:21,877 --> 01:02:23,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow, I shot myself in the foot.

914
01:02:23,658 --> 01:02:28,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the rumor is it is coming bundled with a game.

915
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:29,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really, Loki?

916
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:30,499
[SPEAKER_10]: What have you heard?

917
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:32,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that there's going to be a pack-in game.

918
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:34,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Not sure what it is.

919
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:35,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know which one?

920
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's anything that's probably been announced yet.

921
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:38,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably just tech demos.

922
01:02:38,741 --> 01:02:42,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not tech demos, but remember how Wii Sports was?

923
01:02:43,102 --> 01:02:44,342
[SPEAKER_10]: That was all their tech demos.

924
01:02:45,242 --> 01:02:46,122
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my guess.

925
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,543
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be very well one of Kinect Sports or something like that.

926
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:51,003
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know.

927
01:02:51,323 --> 01:03:00,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one other quick thing on Kinect I want to get out there is that if you were unable to go to E3 and you happen to live near a Microsoft store, there's not a lot of these.

928
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:01,173
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like four.

929
01:03:01,233 --> 01:03:05,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's like two in Southern California, one in Arizona, I want to say.

930
01:03:05,057 --> 01:03:05,818
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a lot of these.

931
01:03:06,118 --> 01:03:07,980
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like four Microsoft stores.

932
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:12,004
[SPEAKER_09]: They're kind of like Apple stores, but instead of Apple, it's Microsoft.

933
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:27,863
[SPEAKER_09]: you can play the Kinect in the stores they actually have the demos right now Kinectimals according to the official Twitter for the stores which is at Microsoft Store on Twitter is the game that's being shown off right now so it sounds like they're going to rotate in different Kinect games

934
01:03:28,483 --> 01:03:32,125
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I noticed when they have a new piece of interface technology?

935
01:03:32,145 --> 01:03:38,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember when the DS was just released and they just had games that amounted to just tech demos?

936
01:03:38,408 --> 01:03:40,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean like Yoshi Touch and Go.

937
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:47,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for the first part of the lifespan of the Wii, they just had games that were mostly just tech demos.

938
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:54,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hope since motion sensor technology is matured by now that Microsoft would have more than glorified tech demos.

939
01:03:54,396 --> 01:04:17,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the technology is matured but unfortunately people and developers have not matured and I understand that developers can do way better than what's out there right now but people like what's out there right now and so that's why they're emulating the same stuff you see on other systems like a Wii Sports type game, a Wii Sports Resort type game, a party game, that kind of stuff.

940
01:04:18,652 --> 01:04:23,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Since you brought up the DS launch titles though, I have to say this, because this always cracks me up.

941
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:27,516
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what DS game, I don't know if it was a launch title, but it came out in the first three months.

942
01:04:27,556 --> 01:04:29,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, I owned Ping Pals.

943
01:04:29,677 --> 01:04:30,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it was so terrible.

944
01:04:30,938 --> 01:04:32,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Ping Pals was so terrible.

945
01:04:32,438 --> 01:04:33,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought two copies.

946
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:35,620
[SPEAKER_09]: I was coerced into buying two copies.

947
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:37,841
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so terrible, but here's why.

948
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:38,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's why.

949
01:04:38,861 --> 01:04:40,622
[SPEAKER_09]: It was this awesome DS game.

950
01:04:40,962 --> 01:04:42,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I say awesome very sarcastically, by the way.

951
01:04:43,104 --> 01:04:49,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you could chat with other people on their nearby DSs by drawing.

952
01:04:50,228 --> 01:04:52,769
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could do these draw chats back and forth.

953
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:54,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what Pink Pals was all about.

954
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:57,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It was PictoChat with avatars.

955
01:04:57,372 --> 01:04:59,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, Nintendo fucked them over, didn't they?

956
01:04:59,873 --> 01:05:00,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was $30 times two.

957
01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:11,133
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, yeah, you can pay for this, or you can play it for free now.

958
01:05:11,914 --> 01:05:13,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Pink Pals wasn't even online.

959
01:05:14,217 --> 01:05:16,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It had these avatars.

960
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:17,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there was some type of game.

961
01:05:17,521 --> 01:05:22,848
[SPEAKER_10]: You may remember, Rob, that when the DS came out, they didn't have online.

962
01:05:23,749 --> 01:05:47,605
[SPEAKER_09]: that's right but it was like it was like that hidden thing it was that secret thing that Nintendo always puts that magical thing in their new system that they'll they'll tell you later gotcha it was in there the whole time there's always something like that seriously with the DS it was the internet like oh secretly it was there the whole time the Wii's kind of had I don't know it has some slumbering stuff like that too the channels that they come out with and stuff you know just interesting

963
01:05:47,873 --> 01:05:55,778
[SPEAKER_07]: So since the buying public is used to it, Microsoft's gonna pick up a shovel and Sony's gonna pick up a shovel and just start shoveling games our way.

964
01:05:58,099 --> 01:05:59,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's what I'm saying.

965
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:06,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that the Wii has the advantage of the price point because it's $150 now.

966
01:06:06,964 --> 01:06:15,349
[SPEAKER_10]: And they do have the disadvantage that you have to buy the extra sensor if you want to play those games.

967
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:15,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

968
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,912
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, once again, it's all about perception.

969
01:06:19,952 --> 01:06:31,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Because yeah, Wii costs $150, but let's say if you're setting it up for a family of four, it's going to cost a lot more to do that with a Wii than it would be on an Xbox 360.

970
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:39,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, even though it may seem that the Wii is a better choice, with all the extra added crap to it, it's going to add up.

971
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:39,929
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

972
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:42,391
[SPEAKER_10]: With Sony, it's the same thing.

973
01:06:42,411 --> 01:06:44,312
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have to buy all these different accessories.

974
01:06:44,592 --> 01:06:47,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I know you don't have to buy all these accessories if you want to play by yourself.

975
01:06:48,294 --> 01:06:48,934
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

976
01:06:48,974 --> 01:06:53,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you want to play with just one other person, then you can save yourself a little bit of money.

977
01:06:53,496 --> 01:06:57,898
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least with the Kinect, it'll support up to as many players as the game will support.

978
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:05,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, before we get to Jamie's next story and then the release dates here, I've got to read this real quick because this was linked to us in chat by Robocoon.

979
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:10,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Linked us to the official Ping Pals Wikipedia article and I've got to read this excerpt because it's gold.

980
01:07:10,147 --> 01:07:10,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready?

981
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep in mind this is Wikipedia.

982
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Ping Pals was released on December 8th, 2004.

983
01:07:46,834 --> 01:07:49,884
[SPEAKER_09]: The reviewer gave a one-word written summary reading, pointless.

984
01:07:51,914 --> 01:07:52,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

985
01:07:52,754 --> 01:08:00,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game an average of .5 out of 10 with the game receiving two zeros and one 1.5.

986
01:08:00,797 --> 01:08:03,297
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really shiny, girl-friendly air.

987
01:08:03,337 --> 01:08:03,978
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my favorite.

988
01:08:04,278 --> 01:08:05,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Girl-friendly.

989
01:08:07,399 --> 01:08:09,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's why I had to buy two copies.

990
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:13,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe being a brain-dead vegetable hooked up to life support girl-friendly.

991
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,821
[SPEAKER_10]: The GMR magazine gave it a 0 out of 10.

992
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:18,322
[SPEAKER_10]: It's below their normal scale.

993
01:08:19,022 --> 01:08:19,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

994
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:21,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

995
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:22,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a girl-friendly story for us?

996
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I have something that makes me happy.

997
01:08:24,731 --> 01:08:25,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

998
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook games are going poop.

999
01:08:28,693 --> 01:08:30,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep in mind, the only thing that I play is Hotel City.

1000
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:33,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, I'm a fan of not playing Farmville.

1001
01:08:33,815 --> 01:08:34,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I hate Farmville.

1002
01:08:34,896 --> 01:08:38,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmville is like the poop that dung beetles poop.

1003
01:08:40,118 --> 01:08:41,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Farmville's free on the iPhone right now, you know?

1004
01:08:42,139 --> 01:08:42,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1005
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:44,080
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd have to pay me.

1006
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:44,660
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate.

1007
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,321
[SPEAKER_09]: My friends are now playing Frontierville.

1008
01:08:47,481 --> 01:09:04,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamasutra keeps up with the who's playing what on Facebook games and basically the big Zynga games have gone down Farmville went from 66.6 million to 63.9 million Treasure Isle dropped 2.5 million and Cafe World lost 1.5 million

1009
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:18,099
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing there that's really keeping it steady that's attracting new players is Texas Hold'em Poker.

1010
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:20,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 28.6 million players.

1011
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,261
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to wonder how many of those are actual people.

1012
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:28,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate the stupid games.

1013
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:31,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are finally starting to go, I'm wasting my time.

1014
01:09:32,483 --> 01:09:33,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do something.

1015
01:09:33,724 --> 01:09:35,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever heard the music in Farmville?

1016
01:09:35,244 --> 01:09:35,284
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1017
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:38,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, they made new ones.

1018
01:09:38,806 --> 01:09:39,046
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1019
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:39,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

1020
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:41,250
[SPEAKER_09]: When I played Farm... Never mind.

1021
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:44,576
[SPEAKER_09]: When I used to play Farmville, the theme song was so horrible.

1022
01:09:44,716 --> 01:09:48,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It was this one thing that would loop over and over and over again.

1023
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:49,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess now... I tried it once.

1024
01:09:52,156 --> 01:09:54,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, why?

1025
01:09:55,619 --> 01:09:58,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it's not even why as a question, it's why as a statement.

1026
01:09:59,902 --> 01:10:04,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, if I was typing it, it would be, it would have no capitalization and have a period at the end.

1027
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:05,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just be why.

1028
01:10:07,228 --> 01:10:07,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what.

1029
01:10:08,468 --> 01:10:08,689
[SPEAKER_09]: What.

1030
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:11,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be a statement.

1031
01:10:12,017 --> 01:10:14,158
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't even require grammar.

1032
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:15,399
[SPEAKER_09]: But see, here's the thing.

1033
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually really looking forward to the Civilization Facebook game.

1034
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:23,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, there's some really cool sounding stuff around the corner.

1035
01:10:23,304 --> 01:10:24,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a Civ nerd.

1036
01:10:24,665 --> 01:10:25,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I really am.

1037
01:10:26,446 --> 01:10:27,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Go buy Civ.

1038
01:10:27,627 --> 01:10:28,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 7-Elevenville?

1039
01:10:30,889 --> 01:10:32,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I'll play 7-Elevenville.

1040
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:34,952
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a joke, is it?

1041
01:10:35,473 --> 01:10:39,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Zynga, Zynga, Zynga, Zynga, whatever has really taken over 7-Eleven.

1042
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:40,659
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of disgusting.

1043
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:43,802
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of Slurpees do they have?

1044
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:45,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even look.

1045
01:10:45,865 --> 01:10:47,627
[SPEAKER_07]: They still have the whole Iron Man stuff.

1046
01:10:48,683 --> 01:10:49,444
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1047
01:11:14,044 --> 01:11:17,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that's going to be a reality in California after November.

1048
01:11:17,187 --> 01:11:21,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you heard, but it's qualifying for the ballot.

1049
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to smoke weed?

1050
01:11:23,171 --> 01:11:23,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes or no?

1051
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:25,192
[SPEAKER_09]: In a nutshell.

1052
01:11:25,392 --> 01:11:28,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh God, what is my anti-nausea?

1053
01:11:28,314 --> 01:11:28,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll pass.

1054
01:11:29,955 --> 01:11:31,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not even a question.

1055
01:11:31,476 --> 01:11:32,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to pass.

1056
01:11:32,217 --> 01:11:34,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you asked because it's coming in November.

1057
01:11:36,147 --> 01:11:36,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Outro Music

1058
01:11:59,621 --> 01:12:02,824
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're gonna be Amsterdam the sequel.

1059
01:12:02,964 --> 01:12:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1060
01:12:03,645 --> 01:12:04,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good time to stay indoors.

1061
01:12:04,966 --> 01:12:06,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Just need the hookers now.

1062
01:12:06,547 --> 01:12:06,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

1063
01:12:08,677 --> 01:12:09,598
[SPEAKER_09]: for like 60 days.

1064
01:12:09,698 --> 01:12:10,898
[SPEAKER_09]: They had to go to Reno for that.

1065
01:12:11,478 --> 01:12:12,338
[SPEAKER_10]: It's too far away.

1066
01:12:12,379 --> 01:12:13,059
[SPEAKER_09]: For 60 days.

1067
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,319
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll never be able to make it on the pot.

1068
01:12:14,359 --> 01:12:17,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be the most lulzy thing you could ever imagine.

1069
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:20,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody will be high for like 60 days.

1070
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:21,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody.

1071
01:12:21,382 --> 01:12:22,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't smoke pot.

1072
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,563
[SPEAKER_09]: The day California stood still.

1073
01:12:24,983 --> 01:12:29,485
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be so many people just like it's 420 every day.

1074
01:12:29,605 --> 01:12:30,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you know what?

1075
01:12:32,726 --> 01:12:35,186
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like when Prohibition was eliminated.

1076
01:12:35,206 --> 01:12:37,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, pass out, wake up.

1077
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:38,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're over it.

1078
01:12:38,607 --> 01:12:40,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get political for a second, Rob.

1079
01:12:40,468 --> 01:12:40,688
[SPEAKER_04]: May I?

1080
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:42,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hell, why not?

1081
01:12:42,968 --> 01:12:43,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Disclaimer.

1082
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's go ahead and look back at history.

1083
01:12:46,049 --> 01:12:49,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is why this whole stupid war on drugs thing is pretty much bullshit.

1084
01:12:51,411 --> 01:12:54,371
[SPEAKER_04]: When they made booze illegal, what happened?

1085
01:12:54,892 --> 01:12:55,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Black market.

1086
01:12:55,852 --> 01:12:56,832
[SPEAKER_04]: An increase in crime.

1087
01:12:56,892 --> 01:13:00,093
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the heyday of the old school gangster.

1088
01:13:02,132 --> 01:13:03,774
[SPEAKER_09]: But Dick Tracy was here to make it all better.

1089
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:48,964
[SPEAKER_04]: and the moment it became illegal their prices shot up so they could charge more for it and then they were having people run guns and everything and another one actually in the same comic is when Opus and Bill were running for president and the drug traffickers came up and said we hope you'll have tough gun laws that makes more profit for us

1090
01:13:51,346 --> 01:14:00,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that that's a parody, just a little political commentary on it, but the numbers are there.

1091
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:11,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Gun-free zones have a higher rate of gun-related deaths than places where it's legal to carry a firearm.

1092
01:14:13,564 --> 01:14:15,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Criminals don't really care if it's legal or not.

1093
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,733
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but they're less likely to use it when the other person might be armed too.

1094
01:14:18,953 --> 01:14:22,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like Jamie should have a theme song when she's giving history lessons here on the show.

1095
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:25,557
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you want to continue with your history lesson here?

1096
01:14:25,597 --> 01:14:25,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

1097
01:14:26,057 --> 01:14:26,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play a little bit of...

1098
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:30,324
[SPEAKER_09]: God Save the Queen here.

1099
01:14:30,625 --> 01:14:31,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Lord.

1100
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:33,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1101
01:14:37,107 --> 01:14:53,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm saying, and I'm going to completely second what you said, Rob, the moment that the potloss pass, you're going to have a month where people are going to go, and all of the right-wing nutjobs are going to go, ah, see, we told you.

1102
01:14:54,015 --> 01:14:57,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a month later, two months later, it'll be nothing.

1103
01:14:58,017 --> 01:14:58,777
[SPEAKER_04]: No one will care about it.

1104
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:00,900
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean I can go outside?

1105
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's safe.

1106
01:15:02,804 --> 01:15:04,267
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean I actually do go outside?

1107
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:06,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it safe?

1108
01:15:07,574 --> 01:15:08,596
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what this means?

1109
01:15:09,097 --> 01:15:09,939
[SPEAKER_09]: There will come a day...

1110
01:15:10,902 --> 01:15:14,044
[SPEAKER_09]: The Orange Lounge Radio episode where we're all high as fuck.

1111
01:15:15,384 --> 01:15:18,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will be just another episode where I'm in the chat room.

1112
01:15:18,126 --> 01:15:19,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually allergic to pot, by the way.

1113
01:15:19,346 --> 01:15:19,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, me too.

1114
01:15:19,927 --> 01:15:21,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll sound like every other episode.

1115
01:15:21,348 --> 01:15:25,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm allergic to pot, too.

1116
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:33,554
[SPEAKER_04]: But my whole point, and this is the biggest thing with... In fact, I've been listening to a lot of history podcasts, and maybe I'll plug them later.

1117
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:34,414
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1118
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:50,919
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest thing for anyone, if you want to look at what's going on in business right now, if you want to look at what's going on in politics right now, if you want to see, is A or B going to work, look to about 100 to 80 years ago.

1119
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And then tell me, will it work?

1120
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,861
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, it's the same idea, it's the same idea.

1121
01:15:58,881 --> 01:15:58,961
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1122
01:15:59,594 --> 01:16:04,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in this year, 2010, the question is not will it work, but will it blend?

1123
01:16:06,537 --> 01:16:06,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1124
01:16:08,258 --> 01:16:09,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for letting me rant.

1125
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:09,999
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1126
01:16:10,219 --> 01:16:15,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the biggest thing is that if you want to see if something's going to work now, look to the past.

1127
01:16:16,722 --> 01:16:19,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee in our chatroom says, OLR with weed is Orange Lawn's foodio.

1128
01:16:20,104 --> 01:16:22,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, just like every other week.

1129
01:16:23,737 --> 01:16:26,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever done OLR on weed?

1130
01:16:26,858 --> 01:16:30,019
[SPEAKER_08]: You boys like Mexico?

1131
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:33,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, one last little political snipe.

1132
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

1133
01:16:35,281 --> 01:16:49,866
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to see what, you know, for all the advocates that were voting for unregulated business, look back to Carnegie and to Rockefeller and see how well people fared when they were in control of unregulated business.

1134
01:16:50,426 --> 01:16:51,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything in moderation.

1135
01:16:51,948 --> 01:16:53,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1136
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:54,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Moderate, moderation.

1137
01:16:56,033 --> 01:16:56,994
[SPEAKER_09]: That's redundant.

1138
01:16:57,374 --> 01:16:59,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1139
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Your redundancy is repetitive.

1140
01:17:03,561 --> 01:17:04,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

1141
01:17:04,783 --> 01:17:05,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Release dates.

1142
01:17:07,325 --> 01:17:08,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Lead is coming out November 4th.

1143
01:17:10,148 --> 01:17:10,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

1144
01:17:10,909 --> 01:17:11,189
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1145
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,051
[SPEAKER_10]: What's coming out in the U.S.?

1146
01:17:13,151 --> 01:17:17,456
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's kind of odd that it's timed right with the Kinect.

1147
01:17:19,178 --> 01:17:20,139
[SPEAKER_10]: It works off weed.

1148
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:21,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, anyways.

1149
01:17:22,557 --> 01:17:24,558
[SPEAKER_10]: There's lots of stuff actually coming out this week.

1150
01:17:24,578 --> 01:17:28,919
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty decent release week, which is good because next week, there's not a whole lot.

1151
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:32,421
[SPEAKER_10]: So this week, we've got Sin and Punishment Star Successor.

1152
01:17:32,461 --> 01:17:33,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it's not this week.

1153
01:17:33,481 --> 01:17:34,322
[SPEAKER_10]: That's today!

1154
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:37,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've missed out on it already, possibly.

1155
01:17:38,543 --> 01:17:43,268
[SPEAKER_09]: and you wasted your whole day watching the Mario Marathon and you could have been playing Sin and Punishment.

1156
01:17:43,328 --> 01:17:44,209
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's a good cause.

1157
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:45,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1158
01:17:46,191 --> 01:17:50,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Death Smiles Limited Edition making its way out to the Xbox 360 this week.

1159
01:17:50,474 --> 01:17:52,056
[SPEAKER_10]: A pretty awesome shmup game.

1160
01:17:52,096 --> 01:17:54,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely worth picking up and plus you get a

1161
01:17:54,338 --> 01:17:55,639
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 Nights 2, Now With More Nights

1162
01:18:26,153 --> 01:18:27,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming to Xbox 360 99 Nights 2 Night Harder

1163
01:18:32,218 --> 01:18:41,041
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 Nights 2, Electric Boogaloo Singularity on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1164
01:18:41,561 --> 01:18:42,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Might call that Time Shift 2.

1165
01:18:44,842 --> 01:18:51,444
[SPEAKER_10]: The Last Airbender, the game based off the movie, based off the anime, based off another game.

1166
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:54,425
[SPEAKER_10]: That's on DS and Wii.

1167
01:18:54,805 --> 01:19:00,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure it's going to be so much better than the ones based off the animated series.

1168
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:08,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Sniper Ghost Warrior on PC and Xbox 360 Sniper Ghost Warrior?

1169
01:19:09,608 --> 01:19:09,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1170
01:19:11,129 --> 01:19:12,309
[SPEAKER_09]: They're reaching for titles.

1171
01:19:12,429 --> 01:19:18,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like a sci-fi movie starring Deborah Gibson and Tiffany.

1172
01:19:18,972 --> 01:19:22,993
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like ghosts because they hide in the shadows and snipe you in the head.

1173
01:19:23,653 --> 01:19:27,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta start that tangent again about why they need to make games out of sci-fi movies.

1174
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:32,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you hear the one this week about Debbie Gibson and Tiffany being in a movie together?

1175
01:19:32,937 --> 01:19:35,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw that article and I was just like, I don't care.

1176
01:19:37,455 --> 01:19:38,216
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what though?

1177
01:19:38,516 --> 01:19:43,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I do agree with you because cheesy games do end up being pretty cool.

1178
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:51,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is why, once again, I must urge you, D3 Publishing, bring over the simple series.

1179
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:54,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, you know you wanna.

1180
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:56,832
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know Oni Chambara didn't really do that well.

1181
01:19:56,852 --> 01:20:00,054
[SPEAKER_10]: All you need to do is put more levels and they only have to be that different.

1182
01:20:00,414 --> 01:20:03,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Just more levels, completely forget the last games existed, add a few different enemy types.

1183
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:06,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you should make a level editor in there and four player co-op.

1184
01:20:23,832 --> 01:20:26,755
[SPEAKER_10]: and 4Player System Link or 4Player Over Live.

1185
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Gold!

1186
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:30,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of ludicrous, you might like this, Loki.

1187
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:35,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I was listening to Bobby's show on the way over here in the car on the handy-dandy All Games iPhone app.

1188
01:20:35,962 --> 01:20:38,164
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was talking about risk factions.

1189
01:20:38,284 --> 01:20:41,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm kind of paraphrasing here because I haven't played the game myself, but he did.

1190
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:47,052
[SPEAKER_09]: But he was talking about how, you know, there's classic risk in there where you can play as all the different countries and da-da-da-da-da.

1191
01:20:47,452 --> 01:20:48,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1192
01:20:59,798 --> 01:21:03,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can lead an army of cats against an army of zombies.

1193
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:05,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.

1194
01:21:06,222 --> 01:21:09,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need more cheesy games like Tachyon starring Bruce Campbell.

1195
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:11,905
[SPEAKER_07]: President Cat, hello, whatever happened with that?

1196
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:12,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't think I ever forgot.

1197
01:21:13,066 --> 01:21:15,247
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, look at the symbol series over in Japan.

1198
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:19,930
[SPEAKER_10]: On the PlayStation 2, they've released like a good 50 games at least.

1199
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:26,655
[SPEAKER_10]: In that series, for like 20 bucks, they just take these really weird independent games, I guess, and then throw them out there.

1200
01:21:26,675 --> 01:21:27,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they have what?

1201
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:32,200
[SPEAKER_10]: They have one with nurses with miniguns mowing down zombies.

1202
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,922
[SPEAKER_10]: They have zombies versus ambulance!

1203
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:37,584
[SPEAKER_10]: You drive an ambulance and you run over zombies!

1204
01:21:37,944 --> 01:21:38,825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome!

1205
01:21:39,045 --> 01:21:49,314
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, there's actually a lot of games with zombies now that I think of it for the simple series, because there's only Chambara, which is basically you fighting zombies with a samurai sword and a chick wearing a bikini and a cowboy hat.

1206
01:21:50,115 --> 01:21:52,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but Earth Defense Force is so awesome, though.

1207
01:21:53,539 --> 01:22:01,871
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an incredible game, and I really want to go back and play the PlayStation 2 version of Earth Defense Force 2 because they have, like, a chick with a jetpack you can fly around as.

1208
01:22:02,672 --> 01:22:04,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, they have these different, um...

1209
01:22:06,056 --> 01:22:33,907
[SPEAKER_10]: different looking characters I mean they're the same like they have the robot types and the UFOs and stuff like that but the one robot type in there kind of looks like a tripod from War of the Worlds and that's really cool and it's just the whole point is cheesy stuff even like you know Zombies Ate My Neighbors a perfect example of how you can make a game that's cheesy that parodies a bunch of like you know old sci-fi horror movies I think it's a great idea but anyways we're getting on a tangent here so

1210
01:22:34,987 --> 01:22:36,329
[SPEAKER_10]: OLR Tangents?

1211
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:37,351
[SPEAKER_07]: No, never.

1212
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:38,913
[SPEAKER_10]: More stuff coming out this week.

1213
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:41,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Fallen Earth Blood Sports on PC.

1214
01:22:41,897 --> 01:22:45,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of wonder what sports are they playing in Fallen Earth?

1215
01:22:46,945 --> 01:22:47,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1216
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:49,348
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't say.

1217
01:22:49,989 --> 01:22:51,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's an expansion.

1218
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:53,223
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1219
01:23:08,663 --> 01:23:11,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, what other fun stuff do we have here?

1220
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:15,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, just sing with microphone for the DS.

1221
01:23:15,531 --> 01:23:18,274
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can sing karaoke on your DS.

1222
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:20,156
[SPEAKER_10]: So just dance, but sing?

1223
01:23:20,776 --> 01:23:21,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite.

1224
01:23:22,438 --> 01:23:23,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Different company.

1225
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:25,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if you can sing brew.

1226
01:23:27,346 --> 01:23:29,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Naughty Bear on PlayStation 3.

1227
01:23:29,888 --> 01:23:33,370
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of those in San Francisco this weekend.

1228
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the trailer for that?

1229
01:23:35,492 --> 01:23:36,473
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks like fun.

1230
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,094
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't seen it.

1231
01:23:38,954 --> 01:23:40,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll YouTube it right now.

1232
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:43,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Hitman with teddy bears.

1233
01:23:43,037 --> 01:23:49,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to get revenge on all the other little teddy bears in the village and the whole point is to be as evil as possible.

1234
01:23:49,381 --> 01:23:51,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You have an evil meter, or naughty meter.

1235
01:23:52,063 --> 01:23:57,931
[SPEAKER_04]: and, like, you can kill them, but you get more points for torturing them and being witnessed torturing them.

1236
01:23:58,492 --> 01:23:59,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's Overlord with teddy bears.

1237
01:24:01,516 --> 01:24:02,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.

1238
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:04,299
[SPEAKER_23]: It's horrible and beautiful at the same time.

1239
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:04,820
[SPEAKER_23]: I love it.

1240
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,682
[SPEAKER_23]: That looks like Crackdown 2.

1241
01:24:06,883 --> 01:24:08,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, this is an ad.

1242
01:24:08,805 --> 01:24:09,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking YouTube.

1243
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:09,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

1244
01:24:12,527 --> 01:24:13,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Crackdown 2 is an excellent game.

1245
01:24:13,788 --> 01:24:15,230
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll be coming out next week on the 6th.

1246
01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:17,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but that's not what I want to see the video for right now.

1247
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I want Naughty Bear.

1248
01:24:18,393 --> 01:24:21,196
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's way better than Naughty Bear, sadly.

1249
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:23,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Naughty Bear, though, you can set traps for them and get their feet caught.

1250
01:24:23,799 --> 01:24:26,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know how much fucking traffic those Naughty Bears caused in San Francisco today?

1251
01:24:26,903 --> 01:24:27,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to go around.

1252
01:24:28,124 --> 01:24:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1253
01:24:28,825 --> 01:24:29,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here we go.

1254
01:24:30,347 --> 01:24:30,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Naughty Bear.

1255
01:24:30,967 --> 01:24:30,947
360.

1256
01:24:31,168 --> 01:24:31,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1257
01:24:41,204 --> 01:24:52,836
[SPEAKER_09]: The game revolves around earning naughty points and a scoring system that is deep but easy to understand.

1258
01:24:53,356 --> 01:24:56,640
[SPEAKER_16]: There are over 250 different ways of being naughty on the island.

1259
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:01,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, you earn points for any naughty things you do and any naughtiness that the other bears witness.

1260
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:11,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Any actions, even basic ones like disabling a car or smashing a window, will start building your multiplier, and this will boost your points for as long as you keep your naughtiness going.

1261
01:25:11,855 --> 01:25:18,061
[SPEAKER_16]: There are dozens of weapons to use, from pistols and machetes to more unusual weapons like umbrellas and frozen legs of lamb.

1262
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:26,169
[SPEAKER_16]: There are also mundane everyday objects like refrigerators, cars, and barbecue grills to experiment with, each one having its own hilarious finishing move.

1263
01:25:27,682 --> 01:25:30,029
[SPEAKER_16]: You know who needs to narrate this game is Super Nanny.

1264
01:25:35,745 --> 01:25:37,607
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been extremely naughty.

1265
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:39,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Go sit in the naughty corner.

1266
01:25:41,549 --> 01:25:45,072
[SPEAKER_16]: ...and they'll give you way more points as they witness all the chaos you're causing.

1267
01:25:45,732 --> 01:25:51,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of the fun of the game is discovering all the different actions that you can do, each one viciously naughty in its own special way.

1268
01:25:51,857 --> 01:25:57,521
[SPEAKER_16]: You can play the game any way you want to and do what you think is best for your current situation to get the most points out of it.

1269
01:25:58,041 --> 01:26:04,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Keep in mind, though, that taking risks, being creative, and changing your tactics often will reward you with a lot more naughty points.

1270
01:26:05,674 --> 01:26:05,934
[SPEAKER_09]: PS3 and Xbox 360

1271
01:26:35,943 --> 01:26:39,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, I might have been joking about this, but now it sounds kind of cool.

1272
01:26:39,537 --> 01:26:41,686

1296
01:28:28,482 --> 01:28:29,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

1297
01:28:29,783 --> 01:28:33,306

1314
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, nothing new on the Wii this week.

1315
01:29:28,602 --> 01:29:31,203
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of surprising, but there is no new games on the Wii this week.

1316
01:29:31,744 --> 01:29:39,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Still some games coming out on the PlayStation 2, including Sacred Rider X-E-C-H-S.

1323
01:29:56,288 --> 01:29:59,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Because seriously, seriously, Jamie, this is like the funniest thing I saw all week.

1324
01:29:59,389 --> 01:30:00,630
[SPEAKER_09]: The rapist for five bucks.

1325
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:04,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Next to the dog shitting at the Vuvuzela, this was the funniest thing I saw all week, okay?

1326
01:30:05,873 --> 01:30:08,554
[SPEAKER_09]: There's Alex Trebek, I guess, on Jeopardy this week.

1327
01:30:08,574 --> 01:30:11,196
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a category that was like auto-tune questions.

1328
01:30:11,656 --> 01:30:12,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no.

1329
01:30:12,116 --> 01:30:14,738
[SPEAKER_09]: And so Alex Trebek's voice was all auto-tuned.

1330
01:30:15,138 --> 01:30:16,279
[SPEAKER_09]: It was hilarious.

1331
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:16,919
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta...

1332
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to YouTube that.

1333
01:30:19,284 --> 01:30:20,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger Claw will have a link in five seconds.

01:30:20,926 --> 01:30:21,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wait.

1335
01:30:21,386 --> 01:30:22,627
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll play it on the show here in a minute.

1336
01:30:22,948 --> 01:30:23,228
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1337
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:28,593
[SPEAKER_09]: So Sacred Rider Shreks is coming out this week.

1338
01:30:29,834 --> 01:30:31,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the rest of it, but my mother's a whore.

1339
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:37,180
[SPEAKER_09]: and Sacred Rider Shaxx.

1340
01:30:38,441 --> 01:30:41,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Troops of otherworldly aliens are invading Earth.

1341
01:30:41,922 --> 01:30:49,484
[SPEAKER_09]: To protect the planet and humanity, six chosen youths are recruited into the Sacred Rider team under you, their commander.

1342
01:30:50,264 --> 01:30:53,025
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, they are under me, their commander.

1343
01:30:53,085 --> 01:30:54,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you get under, Shaxx?

1344
01:30:56,166 --> 01:30:57,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a bad enough dude?

1345
01:30:59,547 --> 01:31:00,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, joke's old.

1346
01:31:00,807 --> 01:31:02,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it when my team is under me.

1347
01:31:04,562 --> 01:31:06,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to the PSP.

1348
01:31:07,563 --> 01:31:09,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Some games coming out on the PSP.

1349
01:31:10,084 --> 01:31:14,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Hanayaka Kana Warega Ichizoku comes out on the PSP.

1350
01:31:15,605 --> 01:31:22,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any clue what that game is, but it looks like a game about a train conductor and a samurai, if the box art is any...

1351
01:31:24,764 --> 01:31:25,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1352
01:31:25,304 --> 01:31:26,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I got nothing.

1353
01:31:27,505 --> 01:31:31,807
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really pimping up those train sims, man.

1354
01:31:31,867 --> 01:31:32,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Secretly they're friends.

1355
01:31:33,008 --> 01:31:35,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one more, and then I got something for DarkSakura.

1356
01:31:36,169 --> 01:31:37,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you wanted to see the box art for that game.

1357
01:31:37,790 --> 01:31:38,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, here we go.

1358
01:31:39,751 --> 01:31:43,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Hanayaka Kanawarega Ichigosu.

1359
01:31:43,293 --> 01:31:44,733
[SPEAKER_09]: See a train conductor and a samurai.

1360
01:31:44,773 --> 01:31:45,934
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that look like to you?

1361
01:31:50,697 --> 01:31:51,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie knows some obscure shit.

1362
01:31:51,538 --> 01:31:52,999
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that that's off of a manga.

1363
01:31:53,619 --> 01:31:53,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1364
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:58,764
[SPEAKER_22]: But I know that there were a couple about... I think that that one's off of a manga.

1365
01:31:59,725 --> 01:32:02,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So a samurai and a train conductor walk to a bar.

1366
01:32:03,748 --> 01:32:07,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Also keep in mind that when trains... Here's another history lesson.

1367
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:11,014
[SPEAKER_04]: The very end of the samurai era in Japan...

1368
01:32:16,098 --> 01:32:20,742
[SPEAKER_04]: was along the lines of the industrialization when they started getting train lines and everything.

1369
01:32:20,822 --> 01:32:21,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes sense.

1370
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:22,364
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1371
01:32:22,444 --> 01:32:29,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So just so you guys know, the official Orange Lounge Radio Game of the Week we want released in the U.S.

1372
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:33,194
[SPEAKER_09]: because, you know, we were the show that started the whole President Cat thing.

1373
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:37,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think once in a while we do need to mention games that ought to come out here in the U.S.

1374
01:32:37,538 --> 01:32:39,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give that to Sacred Rider Shecksh.

1375
01:32:42,721 --> 01:32:52,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Alex Meets Auto-Tune, you have to identify the song I am performing with technological help.

1376
01:32:52,926 --> 01:32:55,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to try Alex Meets Auto-Tune 200.

1377
01:32:55,527 --> 01:32:56,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Pay attention, players.

1378
01:32:56,928 --> 01:32:58,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And the child takes the nurse.

1379
01:32:58,849 --> 01:33:00,169
[SPEAKER_13]: The child takes the nurse.

1380
01:33:00,890 --> 01:33:02,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I pull the carrier.

1381
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:03,511
[SPEAKER_13]: The child takes the nurse.

1382
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:04,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Paul.

1383
01:33:04,671 --> 01:33:05,752
[SPEAKER_13]: What is The Farmer in the Dell?

1384
01:33:05,932 --> 01:33:06,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1385
01:33:06,952 --> 01:33:08,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Alex meets Autotune 400.

1386
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:09,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen.

1387
01:33:09,773 --> 01:33:13,014
[SPEAKER_11]: I come from Alabama with my bench on my knee.

1388
01:33:13,594 --> 01:33:16,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to Louisiana, my true love for to see.

1389
01:33:17,796 --> 01:33:18,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Paul.

1390
01:33:18,156 --> 01:33:19,096
[SPEAKER_13]: What is Oh Susanna?

1391
01:33:19,296 --> 01:33:19,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1392
01:33:19,777 --> 01:33:20,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to Autotune 600.

1393
01:33:20,697 --> 01:33:31,181
[SPEAKER_11]: In the beauty of the sea, Christ was born across the sea with a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.

1394
01:33:31,801 --> 01:33:32,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul.

1395
01:33:33,596 --> 01:33:36,398
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the Battle Hymn of the Republic?

1396
01:33:36,538 --> 01:33:38,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you got it in just in the nick of time.

1397
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:38,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Well done.

1398
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,041
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what she said.

1399
01:33:43,643 --> 01:33:45,104
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even have to say it!

1400
01:33:49,888 --> 01:33:50,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1401
01:33:50,888 --> 01:33:51,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I give up.

1402
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:53,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I pass the crown to Loki.

1403
01:33:55,111 --> 01:33:55,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

1404
01:33:55,752 --> 01:34:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it's awfully sad that it took him that long to figure out what the song was.

1405
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious Pop in our chat says, this is the worst thing I've ever heard.

1406
01:34:05,304 --> 01:34:06,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Was this for real?

1407
01:34:06,685 --> 01:34:13,073
[SPEAKER_09]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, live at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

1408
01:34:15,455 --> 01:34:16,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Shameless promotion.

1409
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week, we'll have the auto-tuned version.

1410
01:34:22,921 --> 01:34:28,744
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the segments I always wanted to do on this program was Xtifer auto-tunes the Wii releases for the week.

1411
01:34:29,484 --> 01:34:32,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And have the IMT, because there's an app on the iPhone called IMT Pain.

1412
01:34:33,066 --> 01:34:40,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And we would actually have Xtifer sing what was coming out on virtual console for the week.

1413
01:34:40,529 --> 01:34:41,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we would play that on the show.

1414
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:43,231
[SPEAKER_09]: But it just didn't work out.

1415
01:34:44,592 --> 01:35:03,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe in the future I am not opposed to Extifer and Autotune coming back for another segment on the show FUs of the week In Autotune Whole show in Autotune No Alright, DarkSakura, what's coming out in the UK?

1416
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:04,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff.

1417
01:35:05,281 --> 01:35:05,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1418
01:35:05,641 --> 01:35:06,342
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know what stuff.

1419
01:35:07,442 --> 01:35:11,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Arma 2, Operation Arrowhead, TNA Impact, Cross the Line.

1420
01:35:13,086 --> 01:35:14,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are on the 29th.

1421
01:35:14,847 --> 01:35:28,075
[SPEAKER_04]: On July 2nd, we have APB, Dragon Ball Origins 2, Pro Cycling Manager 2010, Tournament of Legends on Wii, Tiger Woods, PGA Tour 11, blah, blah.

1422
01:35:28,636 --> 01:35:28,956
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1423
01:35:30,472 --> 01:35:34,155
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1424
01:35:34,495 --> 01:35:39,179
[SPEAKER_09]: The game that DarkSakura says, hey, hey, listen, you should play this game.

1425
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:40,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1426
01:35:42,382 --> 01:35:49,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Microsoft, of course, didn't reveal anything 3D, I guess, this year.

1427
01:35:50,808 --> 01:35:58,815
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're basically quoted as saying, we have the attitude that we're seeing what the adoption looks like of 3D.

1428
01:35:59,435 --> 01:36:02,216
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1429
01:36:20,243 --> 01:36:24,164
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really expensive and kind of unnecessary for 3D right now.

1430
01:36:24,224 --> 01:36:26,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you're going the route of 3DS.

1431
01:36:27,025 --> 01:36:30,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm not buying a new TV for some fucking 3D game.

1432
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:33,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Nor am I buying really fucking expensive glasses.

1433
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:38,429
[SPEAKER_10]: And I seriously don't understand why they're not doing the fucking... What is it?

1434
01:36:38,449 --> 01:36:45,191
[SPEAKER_10]: The Disney system that they have where those really cheap-ass glasses out there... I don't remember what it's called now.

1435
01:36:45,471 --> 01:36:46,611
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've quoted it on the show.

1436
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:47,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't either.

1437
01:36:48,152 --> 01:36:48,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1438
01:36:49,453 --> 01:36:50,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1439
01:37:08,067 --> 01:37:13,690
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is, is that the cost of technology, especially in television, tends to fall down quick.

1440
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:22,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I can remember a time only about four or five years ago where HD TVs cost shit tons of money like these 3D TVs do now.

1441
01:37:22,375 --> 01:37:26,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in four or five years, 3D TVs will be fairly common.

1442
01:37:26,457 --> 01:37:31,700
[SPEAKER_10]: And it makes sense for Sony to be pushing 3D in their gaming because they sell 3D TVs.

1443
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,541
[SPEAKER_10]: They're an electronics company.

1444
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:34,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1445
01:37:56,315 --> 01:37:57,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's a big selling point.

1446
01:37:58,277 --> 01:38:01,680
[SPEAKER_10]: And to add the 3D technology to it, I mean, it would be dumb not to do it.

1447
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:06,125
[SPEAKER_10]: But, is anyone, I mean, is everybody going to really jump on board with this?

1448
01:38:06,865 --> 01:38:11,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not, because honestly, yeah, it's kind of cool, Killzone 3 and stuff like that, but

1449
01:38:12,891 --> 01:38:13,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1450
01:38:31,923 --> 01:38:59,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say the first time you see the 3DS you're gonna be like holy shit but I think even then you know even the 3DS is gonna be like okay it's a gimmick but it's a really good gimmick and I think especially the games to back up the gimmick are gonna make that system last but I think Nintendo's taking the right approach they're gonna make 3D affordable it's just they're gonna go on a smaller scale with it and if that's not for you you don't have to use it you don't have to use the 3D and at the end of the day it's just a more powerful gaming system for them

1451
01:39:02,071 --> 01:39:10,513
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Microsoft will just wait until the next cycle of the game consoles, the Xbox 720, if you will, before they jump in on this.

1452
01:39:10,553 --> 01:39:11,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

1453
01:39:11,193 --> 01:39:12,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's why.

1454
01:39:12,113 --> 01:39:14,814
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because they already have games that support 3D.

1455
01:39:15,294 --> 01:39:20,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily that they're going to be jumping on board with everything supporting 3D.

1456
01:39:20,076 --> 01:39:23,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Game companies out there right now can use 3D.

1457
01:39:23,877 --> 01:39:26,418
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, Avatar that came out on Xbox 360.

1458
01:39:27,338 --> 01:39:27,878
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

1459
01:39:52,717 --> 01:39:58,443
[SPEAKER_10]: All those Sony will like to spin it that it's going to be 3D on their system to make it seem like it's not going to be on the other systems.

1460
01:39:58,543 --> 01:40:02,127
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, it's capable of doing it.

1461
01:40:02,447 --> 01:40:08,253
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just they may not be just jumping on board with the, oh, look at all these games that are in 3D.

1462
01:40:08,594 --> 01:40:10,816
[SPEAKER_10]: Like you probably won't see any Xbox Live Arcade games come out 3D.

1463
01:40:12,197 --> 01:40:38,950
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says I do want to see Tron in 3D though I want to see Geometry Wars updated for 3D BlackWolf, the man who does the show before us here at All Games Radio says force feedback in a controller was also a gimmick just saying, but it was a cheap gimmick still is a gimmick no, I get what you're saying though I do think though the whole 3D thing

1464
01:40:41,648 --> 01:40:42,589
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be cute for a while.

1465
01:40:42,689 --> 01:40:44,930
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember when Sony... Never forget!

1466
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:49,191
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember when Sony said, Hey, force feedback's just crap.

1467
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:50,232
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't really need it.

1468
01:40:50,532 --> 01:40:51,132
[SPEAKER_10]: I do remember.

1469
01:40:51,172 --> 01:40:52,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's overrated.

1470
01:40:52,233 --> 01:40:52,773
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need this.

1471
01:40:52,953 --> 01:40:55,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they, you know, didn't pay somebody for the rights.

1472
01:40:55,494 --> 01:40:58,055
[SPEAKER_09]: We were the pioneers of force feedback, but you know what?

1473
01:40:58,235 --> 01:41:00,917
[SPEAKER_09]: That is so last gen.

1474
01:41:02,352 --> 01:41:05,853
[SPEAKER_09]: That was so 1998, okay?

1475
01:41:06,113 --> 01:41:09,674
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the PS3, bitches.

1476
01:41:09,734 --> 01:41:11,354
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about Six Axis now.

1477
01:41:11,434 --> 01:41:13,694
[SPEAKER_09]: How many of those games support Six Axis?

1478
01:41:14,035 --> 01:41:14,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, not a lot.

1479
01:41:16,715 --> 01:41:19,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Six Axis now, that's a cheap gimmick right there.

1480
01:41:19,896 --> 01:41:24,517
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, thanks to Six Axis, I can move my head around in LittleBigPlanet.

1481
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:28,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thanks to Six Axis, I can wave my little fake hand in LittleBigPlanet.

1482
01:41:28,818 --> 01:41:30,258
[SPEAKER_09]: What an amazing fucking feature.

1483
01:41:32,682 --> 01:41:36,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one story I got for you guys and we'll get to the classic game of the week.

1484
01:41:36,483 --> 01:41:49,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo has made an admission, oh my god, and heaven forbid, it's Reggie Fils-Aimé talking to Kotaku has said, we look at what we do well, we look at what we don't do so well.

1485
01:41:49,907 --> 01:41:50,267
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1486
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:11,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

1487
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:12,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's applaud.

1488
01:42:12,942 --> 01:42:16,126
[SPEAKER_09]: The first step is admitting that you have a problem.

1489
01:42:16,266 --> 01:42:18,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job, Nintendo.

1490
01:42:19,010 --> 01:42:19,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1491
01:42:19,531 --> 01:42:19,771
[SPEAKER_09]: 11 to go.

1492
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:28,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all know that Nintendo just throw the damn friend codes thing out.

1493
01:42:29,034 --> 01:42:30,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Just copy Xbox.

1494
01:42:30,655 --> 01:42:33,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck, Microsoft's been copying you for how long, Nintendo?

1495
01:42:33,957 --> 01:42:35,579
[SPEAKER_09]: How long have they been copying you?

1496
01:42:35,919 --> 01:42:37,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Just steal from them.

1497
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:39,221
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

1498
01:42:39,542 --> 01:42:48,448
[SPEAKER_09]: We will forgive you because you'll still be giving us Kirby and Donkey Kong and you'll get up on stage and say, and here's a new game, and here's a new game, and it'll be fine.

1499
01:42:50,069 --> 01:42:51,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Just steal Xbox Live.

1500
01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:51,570
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fine.

1501
01:42:52,451 --> 01:42:53,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's going to give you shit.

1502
01:42:55,757 --> 01:43:05,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now's that part of the show where we're going to take a step back in gaming's history and DarkSakura is going to open up the vault and say, hey!

1503
01:43:07,731 --> 01:43:26,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey listen, you kids Hey, listen Are playing these newfangled 3D games in your Kinect But you know what, you need to take a minute Or five, or twenty To go back and play a classic game It's DarkSakura's classic game of the week What have you picked for the lovely audience tonight?

1504
01:43:27,273 --> 01:43:31,995
[SPEAKER_04]: The game of the night is Die Hard Arcade, a.k.a.

1505
01:43:32,175 --> 01:43:33,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynamite DECA.

1506
01:43:33,596 --> 01:43:34,977
[SPEAKER_23]: Yippee-ki-yay.

1507
01:43:34,997 --> 01:43:37,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1508
01:43:38,038 --> 01:43:44,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, basically, the game has the guys landing on, you know, a...

1509
01:43:45,322 --> 01:43:54,166
[SPEAKER_04]: A building, and the main hero, his name was actually, what was his name, Bruno, I think.

1510
01:43:56,287 --> 01:43:57,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Bruno Dellinger.

1511
01:43:57,307 --> 01:44:02,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, but he looked a lot like the character of John McClane, so they made it, they said it worked.

1512
01:44:03,390 --> 01:44:07,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's also landing on a building and fighting his way through the building to save the president's daughter from terrorists.

1513
01:44:09,233 --> 01:44:10,433
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always the president's daughter.

1514
01:44:10,934 --> 01:44:11,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, what'd she do?

1515
01:44:13,274 --> 01:44:26,619
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have different quick time events in there and different cut scenes so you'd have to hit a button in a particular time limit to defeat the enemy or you'd have to, you know, so that you can avoid, you know, actually taking extra time to fight them.

1516
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:28,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So it actually plays though like a little brawler.

1517
01:44:29,761 --> 01:44:30,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a...

1518
01:44:31,858 --> 01:44:34,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never played this, but it's very Final Fight-ish.

1519
01:44:34,219 --> 01:44:34,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1520
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,161
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's room-to-room type of thing.

1521
01:44:40,482 --> 01:44:47,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, it was out for the AM1 systems when it was out in the arcades.

1522
01:44:47,765 --> 01:44:50,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was also partially developed by Sonic Team.

1523
01:44:51,386 --> 01:44:53,067
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the amazing Sonic Team.

1524
01:44:54,240 --> 01:45:01,725
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate, the sequel, Dynamite DECA 2, came out on Dreamcast as Dynamite Cop.

1525
01:45:03,066 --> 01:45:08,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And it actually, to draw another parallel, it actually resembled Speed 2 Cruise Control.

1526
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:10,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's some of the sequel here we've got.

1527
01:45:10,870 --> 01:45:12,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was really cool.

1528
01:45:13,312 --> 01:45:15,313
[SPEAKER_04]: We've actually got Dynamite DECA 2.

1529
01:45:16,053 --> 01:45:19,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would somebody try to emulate Speed 2 Cruise Control?

1530
01:45:19,275 --> 01:45:19,736
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea.

1531
01:45:19,756 --> 01:45:19,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1532
01:45:22,817 --> 01:45:44,419
[SPEAKER_04]: but um with the sequel it's you know more having to save people but you also have a female character in that one so instead of just the two dudes and you can um you can actually uh handcuff them as you're going through the game too so it's it's just a fun good old punch them in the gut game

1533
01:45:47,471 --> 01:45:54,454
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as other versions, Sega Ages on PS2 had a Die Hard Arcade version.

1534
01:45:55,054 --> 01:46:00,696
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, honestly, and for the record, Die Hard Arcade actually came out on the Saturn.

1535
01:46:02,268 --> 01:46:06,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, it stands to reason that Dynamite Cop would be on Dreamcast.

1536
01:46:06,892 --> 01:46:08,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the disco floor in that one.

1537
01:46:09,373 --> 01:46:12,636
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, they're just a couple of really fun games.

1538
01:46:14,157 --> 01:46:16,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put this under Dynamite DECA series.

1539
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:22,083
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, the Dynamite DECA series, but you might notice Die Hard Arcade on the Sega Saturn.

1540
01:46:22,523 --> 01:46:25,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dynamite Cop on the Dreamcast.

1541
01:46:25,866 --> 01:46:28,167
[SPEAKER_09]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1542
01:46:29,788 --> 01:46:30,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

1543
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:36,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Go beat some people up in the context of a video game.

1544
01:46:36,862 --> 01:46:40,004
[SPEAKER_09]: However, don't just go outside and beat people up because that would be wrong.

1545
01:46:41,745 --> 01:46:44,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, I don't know, maybe DarkSakura would approve of that depending on what they're saying.

1546
01:46:44,827 --> 01:46:47,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not advocate going and beating people up.

1547
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:48,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1548
01:46:49,851 --> 01:46:53,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with hitting idiots over the head with the thin end of a fishing pole.

1549
01:46:54,679 --> 01:46:59,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break, you guys, and we will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1550
01:46:59,021 --> 01:47:00,802
[SPEAKER_09]: We have plenty more to come in Part B tonight.

1551
01:47:01,343 --> 01:47:04,204
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some more stories for you guys, some quick stories, of course.

1552
01:47:04,224 --> 01:47:06,326
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do Twitter topics, so make sure you get those in.

1553
01:47:06,886 --> 01:47:11,649
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be talking about new plans for the FBI to step up anti-piracy.

1554
01:47:11,669 --> 01:47:13,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to make Loki talk about that tonight.

1555
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:13,970
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be fun.

1556
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:17,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of comic book related stories coming too, so stay tuned, guys.

1557
01:47:17,612 --> 01:47:21,034
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be right back in a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1558
01:47:27,111 --> 01:47:53,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio We are here live taping our 372nd episode I think if I got count correctly Yes, 372 Here for June the 27th of 2010 Which is technically our 8th anniversary show You know 8 is just one of those numbers It's like, you know, 8's not that special Unless you're talking about the old show 8 is enough Or 8 is enough, alright

1559
01:47:53,627 --> 01:48:18,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we're going to get back into some gaming news here of course I do want to make sure I plug real quick Because something I didn't talk about during my gaming week But one of the other games I played was Pinball this week Pinball FX, specifically on the Xbox 360 Because the big battle is going on right now I don't know if you heard over at All Games I believe the folks at Dead Pixel Live are really kind of the brains behind this But they're putting together this whole big battle between the various shows

1560
01:48:18,967 --> 01:48:39,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe some of the events just wrapped up I think the Soldner X and the Battlefield Bad Company ones were supposed to be ending this weekend So I think they are done I haven't heard anything about the results because I've been out of town But from what I understand, at least what the leaderboards say right now Dead Pixel Live is in first place with 108 points Guess how many points we have?

1561
01:48:40,546 --> 01:48:41,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Zero Six

1562
01:48:44,449 --> 01:48:55,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm just going to chalk that up to the fact that, you know, we got on this a little late and our listeners probably don't really have the Soldier X2 and the Battlefield Bad Company, but look, we can do better, OL Army, at the pinball games.

1563
01:48:55,957 --> 01:49:08,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Zen Pinball, the Earth Defense Force table, that's on PS3, and Pinball FX, the Buccaneer table on the Xbox 360, those are on the systems that are going on right now.

1564
01:49:08,745 --> 01:49:09,726
[SPEAKER_09]: So, check it out.

1565
01:49:10,006 --> 01:49:14,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Now YYR in chat says, ugh, I tried registering for the big battle on Friday and I never got the friend request.

1566
01:49:14,508 --> 01:49:16,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have been first on Soldner X2.

1567
01:49:16,529 --> 01:49:19,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, dude, you might have just got in a little late.

1568
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:20,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1569
01:49:20,331 --> 01:49:30,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's not forget, and I think one kind of like oopsie mistake that might have been made with this whole thing is that it was set up during E3, and then I think Derek, who was kind of putting this together, went to E3.

1570
01:49:31,396 --> 01:49:37,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, there might have been some kinks in it the past couple weeks, but it will be better, I'm hoping.

1571
01:49:37,927 --> 01:49:39,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry about that, YYR.

1572
01:49:39,268 --> 01:49:41,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll have to contest the results.

1573
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:41,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1574
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:44,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I want to put up a stink, though.

1575
01:49:45,951 --> 01:49:48,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I know these things are a pain in the butt to run, though.

1576
01:49:48,692 --> 01:49:48,952
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1577
01:49:50,253 --> 01:49:56,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, but do sign up for the other competitions, at least the Zen Pinball and Pinball FX.

1578
01:49:56,416 --> 01:49:57,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm looking.

1579
01:49:58,096 --> 01:50:01,098
[SPEAKER_09]: YYR, there might be a reprieve because I'm looking on the main website.

1580
01:50:01,138 --> 01:50:02,098
[SPEAKER_09]: It says Soldner X2 is...

1581
01:50:03,579 --> 01:50:05,462
[SPEAKER_09]: July 9th, 2010 now.

1582
01:50:05,523 --> 01:50:07,526
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that might have been extended.

1583
01:50:08,007 --> 01:50:08,448
[SPEAKER_09]: YYR.

1584
01:50:08,728 --> 01:50:10,010
[SPEAKER_09]: So it might not be over yet.

1585
01:50:10,391 --> 01:50:17,143
[SPEAKER_09]: That just might be the results from Battlefield Bad Company or something where I know we had one guy saying they were going to play.

1586
01:50:19,125 --> 01:50:20,646
[SPEAKER_09]: So they probably got six points.

1587
01:50:21,007 --> 01:50:22,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you whoever played.

1588
01:50:22,568 --> 01:50:23,869
[SPEAKER_09]: So YYR might not be over yet.

1589
01:50:23,909 --> 01:50:26,531
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like he might have extended it a week because of all the E3 madness.

1590
01:50:26,551 --> 01:50:27,312
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's cool.

1591
01:50:27,672 --> 01:50:31,115
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, you have until the 16th of July to do Zen Pinball and Pinball FX.

1592
01:50:31,455 --> 01:50:39,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's thebigbattle.net or I believe another way to access that is bigbattle.allgames.com And YYR says, I will double my score.

1593
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:41,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1594
01:50:41,663 --> 01:50:42,104
[SPEAKER_09]: You show them.

1595
01:50:43,244 --> 01:50:43,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll double mine.

1596
01:50:43,825 --> 01:50:44,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Show them.

1597
01:50:44,525 --> 01:50:45,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll double mine.

1598
01:50:45,887 --> 01:50:46,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero times zero is zero.

1599
01:50:49,881 --> 01:50:50,161
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1600
01:50:52,103 --> 01:50:52,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1601
01:50:52,943 --> 01:50:53,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Zappy.

1602
01:50:53,544 --> 01:50:56,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Zappy is a good buddy at Dead Pixel Live and he's in the chat.

1603
01:50:56,666 --> 01:50:58,087
[SPEAKER_09]: How was the Zappy show?

1604
01:50:58,147 --> 01:50:59,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get to hear because I was at E3.

1605
01:50:59,968 --> 01:51:04,372
[SPEAKER_09]: But he says, remember Derek's email is radio at deadpixellive.com if you want to know where to complain.

1606
01:51:04,472 --> 01:51:11,537
[SPEAKER_09]: So YYR, if you're mad and your results don't show up, I would file an official grievance with Derek.

1607
01:51:12,117 --> 01:51:33,791
[SPEAKER_09]: but it honestly looks like he just extended it out and that's cool maybe he realized that E3 was not the best time of the year to start something like this alright, anyhow, let's move on I'm going to work on my pinball scores this week so you guys should too I see all of you on my friends list I know the UL Army can do well at pinball what lady?

1608
01:51:35,652 --> 01:51:36,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing real pinball

1609
01:51:38,223 --> 01:51:39,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Like actual pinball tables?

1610
01:51:39,385 --> 01:51:41,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Pinball FX and Zen Pinball is fun pinball.

1611
01:51:42,209 --> 01:51:42,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a try.

1612
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:44,252
[SPEAKER_09]: What real pinball have you been playing?

1613
01:51:45,213 --> 01:51:45,974
[SPEAKER_04]: World Cup Soccer 94.

1614
01:51:46,034 --> 01:51:52,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I can't make myself sit down to watch the real World Cup, I've just been living vicariously through pinball.

1615
01:51:53,264 --> 01:51:53,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool!

1616
01:51:57,032 --> 01:52:15,382
[SPEAKER_09]: and Revenge for Mars Zappy in our chatroom says the Zappy show got cancelled by work and other problems that's unfortunate it was replaced by the Vuvuzela show actually all week long during E3

1617
01:52:15,987 --> 01:52:20,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Dance Central, a game that was shown off by Harmonix during the Microsoft Press Conference.

1618
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:36,150
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1619
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:07,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1620
01:53:28,250 --> 01:53:32,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Monkey Island 2 is available on Steam, or at least you can pre-order it.

1621
01:53:32,934 --> 01:53:37,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's awesome, though, is if you do pre-order it, you get the first one for free.

1622
01:53:37,438 --> 01:53:41,942
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's awesome, because both those games are excellent, and you should definitely check them out.

1623
01:53:43,223 --> 01:53:45,445
[SPEAKER_10]: The game will be launched on July 7th.

1624
01:53:46,165 --> 01:53:52,971
[SPEAKER_10]: If you happen to pre-order it before then, you will get The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition for absolutely nothing.

1625
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:55,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Free.

1626
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:56,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Free is good.

1627
01:53:56,741 --> 01:53:57,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Both games are awesome.

1628
01:53:58,582 --> 01:53:59,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely check it out.

1629
01:54:01,144 --> 01:54:08,950
[SPEAKER_10]: And last but not least, Yut Sato has teased the possibility that Seaman may be returning on 3DS.

1630
01:54:10,030 --> 01:54:14,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Soon you will be able to request that he friend your butt in full 3D.

1631
01:54:15,194 --> 01:54:17,756
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't know what we're talking about, please go back and listen to last week's show.

1632
01:54:17,776 --> 01:54:19,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it came up at the very, very end.

1633
01:54:19,197 --> 01:54:20,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe that was in the afterbirth.

1634
01:54:20,438 --> 01:54:22,640
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think we played the thing in the afterbirth that it came up on the show.

1635
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:23,561
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1636
01:54:24,923 --> 01:54:25,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1637
01:54:25,764 --> 01:54:28,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, some more news for you guys.

1638
01:54:28,549 --> 01:54:36,282
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder since it does have a human face on the front, if you can capture your face for the Seaman.

1639
01:54:38,183 --> 01:54:39,983
[SPEAKER_10]: So you could be your own seaman.

1640
01:54:41,404 --> 01:54:42,544
[SPEAKER_09]: You could friend your own butt.

1641
01:54:42,804 --> 01:54:43,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1642
01:54:45,685 --> 01:54:47,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet there's a lot of people that would like to do that.

1643
01:54:47,685 --> 01:54:48,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

1644
01:54:50,146 --> 01:54:52,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock band news and the songs that are coming out this week.

1645
01:54:52,726 --> 01:54:53,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what?

1646
01:54:53,266 --> 01:54:54,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out June 29th.

1647
01:54:55,327 --> 01:54:58,027
[SPEAKER_09]: It is all about Nickelback.

1648
01:55:06,374 --> 01:55:07,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought this was not 2002.

1649
01:55:09,356 --> 01:55:14,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Burn it to the ground, figured you out, never again, photograph, rock star in this afternoon.

1650
01:55:14,379 --> 01:55:16,921
[SPEAKER_09]: All of those songs are coming to Rock Band this week.

1651
01:55:17,321 --> 01:55:19,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what version of photograph they should do?

1652
01:55:19,683 --> 01:55:19,903
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1653
01:55:20,443 --> 01:55:21,204
[SPEAKER_04]: The Def Leppard.

1654
01:55:22,664 --> 01:55:26,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And this will forever be known as the week that Rock Band sucked.

1655
01:55:27,147 --> 01:55:27,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

1656
01:55:28,068 --> 01:55:29,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Now with jumping shark action.

1657
01:55:30,665 --> 01:55:34,206
[SPEAKER_09]: MDK 2 is going to be released on WiiWare.

1658
01:55:34,246 --> 01:55:35,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember MDK?

1659
01:55:35,246 --> 01:55:36,986
[SPEAKER_09]: This game came out years ago.

1660
01:55:37,647 --> 01:55:38,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Years ago.

1661
01:55:38,547 --> 01:55:40,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't realize it was a BioWare game.

1662
01:55:41,047 --> 01:55:41,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Go figure.

1663
01:55:41,967 --> 01:55:44,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's an action slash shooter slash puzzle.

1664
01:55:44,968 --> 01:55:45,448
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1665
01:55:45,468 --> 01:55:46,388
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a really cool game.

1666
01:55:46,488 --> 01:55:48,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be coming out on WiiWare, apparently.

1667
01:55:49,029 --> 01:55:54,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're also going to be releasing one on the PC via what's called the Beamdog Distribution Service.

1668
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:57,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of this, but it was founded by somebody who used to work with BioWare.

1669
01:55:57,771 --> 01:55:58,951
[SPEAKER_09]: So, big surprise there.

1670
01:55:59,671 --> 01:56:04,116
[SPEAKER_09]: So, now, by the way, MDK2, that was kind of a game that was out before.

1671
01:56:04,757 --> 01:56:06,779
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get that on Steam or good old games.

1672
01:56:06,939 --> 01:56:08,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are available in both places there.

1673
01:56:08,801 --> 01:56:09,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the first one.

1674
01:56:09,662 --> 01:56:12,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not too big of a fan of the second one, though.

1675
01:56:13,266 --> 01:56:14,828
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, this is something pretty cool.

1676
01:56:14,848 --> 01:56:19,713
[SPEAKER_09]: A little YouTube that was kind of circulating the Internet, and it even made its way to Loki's Twitter.

1677
01:56:19,733 --> 01:56:20,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah!

1678
01:56:21,114 --> 01:56:35,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's this guy, he's playing Team Fortress 2 And apparently this Team Fortress 2 level had a giant cat That would shoot lasers out of his eyes And there were bees in the level Yeah, this is some server that I guess you can play on

1679
01:56:36,633 --> 01:56:43,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically an achievement map that you can run to play different things.

1680
01:56:43,277 --> 01:56:51,141
[SPEAKER_10]: But the guy that created the map also created a special trigger that you can trigger by firing in the corner of one of the spots in the map there.

1681
01:56:51,641 --> 01:56:55,984
[SPEAKER_10]: And that cat will come out and just destroy everything.

1682
01:56:56,244 --> 01:56:56,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, bees!

1683
01:56:57,024 --> 01:56:57,925
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's hilarious.

1684
01:56:57,985 --> 01:56:59,105
[SPEAKER_09]: He shoots bees at you.

1685
01:56:59,185 --> 01:57:00,346
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a nice thing to do.

1686
01:57:00,766 --> 01:57:06,300
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a different video of that same thing, though, where this guy is getting sucked into the cat's mouth.

1687
01:57:06,641 --> 01:57:07,263
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

1688
01:57:07,870 --> 01:57:09,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do I never play this game?

1689
01:57:09,691 --> 01:57:10,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Team Fortress 2.

1690
01:57:11,133 --> 01:57:13,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dirt cheap on Steam for a while, Rob.

1691
01:57:13,094 --> 01:57:13,935
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is.

1692
01:57:14,015 --> 01:57:14,996
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on sale.

1693
01:57:15,016 --> 01:57:15,756
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in the orange box.

1694
01:57:15,776 --> 01:57:16,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got Team Fortress 2.

1695
01:57:16,817 --> 01:57:17,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to pick it up.

1696
01:57:17,958 --> 01:57:18,378
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys need to play.

1697
01:57:18,398 --> 01:57:19,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to play Team Fortress 2 together?

1698
01:57:19,419 --> 01:57:20,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I bet we'd both suck at it.

1699
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:21,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God, yes.

1700
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:21,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

1701
01:57:21,741 --> 01:57:22,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

1702
01:57:22,141 --> 01:57:22,762
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll teach you.

1703
01:57:22,782 --> 01:57:23,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I play still.

1704
01:57:23,802 --> 01:57:24,743
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know who I took?

1705
01:57:24,803 --> 01:57:29,167
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two characters I totally want to play, and one is the spy, and the other one's the scout.

1706
01:57:29,207 --> 01:57:29,427
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1707
01:57:29,587 --> 01:57:30,267
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to play this game.

1708
01:57:30,287 --> 01:57:30,948
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to play it.

1709
01:57:31,068 --> 01:57:31,388
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

1710
01:57:31,488 --> 01:57:31,789
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

1711
01:57:32,089 --> 01:57:33,930
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, we're playing Team Fortress 2.

1712
01:57:33,970 --> 01:57:34,671
[SPEAKER_09]: We just shook on it.

1713
01:57:36,192 --> 01:57:36,912
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

1714
01:57:37,072 --> 01:57:39,713
[SPEAKER_04]: The same way we're going to open my two magic decks and play them, huh?

1715
01:57:40,173 --> 01:57:41,513
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we didn't shake on that.

1716
01:57:41,573 --> 01:57:42,534
[SPEAKER_09]: We shook on this, though.

1717
01:57:42,834 --> 01:57:43,434
[SPEAKER_09]: That's happening.

1718
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:44,274
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1719
01:57:45,455 --> 01:57:47,015
[SPEAKER_09]: No going backs on shakies.

1720
01:57:47,035 --> 01:57:47,675
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1721
01:57:47,975 --> 01:57:48,335
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1722
01:57:48,355 --> 01:57:50,816
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go back and play a game like it's 2007, y'all.

1723
01:57:54,257 --> 01:57:56,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Did Drunami bring a magic deck with him?

1724
01:57:57,338 --> 01:57:58,818
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my high school deck.

1725
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:00,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to double check this.

1726
01:58:03,299 --> 01:58:03,579
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1727
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:04,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Green, red?

1728
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Fires.

1729
01:58:06,294 --> 01:58:10,437
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, stop playing with the magic deck and do your quick news.

1730
01:58:10,957 --> 01:58:13,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'll get to the tweeter topics.

1731
01:58:14,419 --> 01:58:16,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I approve of that deck, by the way.

1732
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:19,342
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the same type of deck I would have played when I was in college the first time.

1733
01:58:21,725 --> 01:58:30,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as far as news goes, Final Fantasy Tactics is coming out for the iPhone and iPod Touch on the 15th of September.

1734
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:36,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know how much it is, but it's gonna be out.

1735
01:58:36,352 --> 01:58:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those who liked it, yay for you.

1736
01:58:39,034 --> 01:58:42,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it, but I'm not a Tactics fan.

1737
01:58:43,796 --> 01:58:44,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay for you.

1738
01:58:49,907 --> 01:58:51,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I can never be anybody but me.

1739
01:58:52,130 --> 01:58:54,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love the way you report news on this show.

1740
01:58:54,332 --> 01:58:58,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't give a shit, but if you like it, then yay for you.

1741
01:58:58,077 --> 01:59:00,760
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're into crap, then you like crap.

1742
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:01,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun.

1743
01:59:01,861 --> 01:59:05,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I will never say that Final Fantasy Tactics is crap.

1744
01:59:05,686 --> 01:59:07,508
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm not a tactics fan.

1745
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:25,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I like tactics I wouldn't consider myself a foamy at the mouth raving fanboy but I like it and I would once the iPhone 4 comes out with a processor well I mean I'm sorry it's out once I'm able to actually get one without having to wait in a five hour long line I will pick up the game probably

1746
01:59:26,187 --> 01:59:37,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in other news too, EA requested a trademark application for Alice Madness Returns.

1747
01:59:38,916 --> 01:59:40,337
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an American McGee fan.

1748
01:59:41,849 --> 01:59:42,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you.

1749
02:00:05,425 --> 02:00:06,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I need to go back and watch them.

1750
02:00:07,108 --> 02:00:12,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but the ones... That's where that went.

1751
02:00:12,656 --> 02:00:17,303
[SPEAKER_04]: The last episodic thing on YouTube I watched any of, Rob, was Hope is Emo.

1752
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:20,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Marvel Costume Packs

1753
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:46,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and from what I can see on this little silhouette thing, I definitely see a Wolverine.

1754
02:00:48,223 --> 02:00:49,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a Storm.

1755
02:00:50,224 --> 02:00:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a Dr. Octopus.

1756
02:00:51,785 --> 02:00:52,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a Spider-Man.

1757
02:00:53,466 --> 02:00:54,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a Human Torch.

1758
02:00:55,807 --> 02:00:57,488
[SPEAKER_04]: There's bound to be a Captain America.

1759
02:00:57,548 --> 02:00:58,608
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an Iron Man.

1760
02:00:59,509 --> 02:01:01,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my Marvel shit well too much.

1761
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:03,991
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a Captain America.

1762
02:01:04,011 --> 02:01:06,392
[SPEAKER_10]: They showed off some of the costumes a while back.

1763
02:01:06,932 --> 02:01:08,313
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know there was a Captain America in there.

02:01:34,577 --> 02:01:35,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Deadpool, Blasphemy

1766
02:01:48,806 --> 02:01:48,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Poo!

1767
02:02:06,914 --> 02:02:15,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and by the way, plug, plug, plug, my interview with Jim McCann, who is the writer of Hawkeye and Mockingbird, is on geeklife.com.

1768
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:19,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Geeklife had the interview with the naked chick, too?

1769
02:02:19,982 --> 02:02:21,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the naked gamer.

1770
02:02:21,723 --> 02:02:22,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1771
02:02:22,724 --> 02:02:22,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1772
02:02:23,224 --> 02:02:23,785
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1773
02:02:24,025 --> 02:02:25,245
[SPEAKER_09]: That was ratings right there.

1774
02:02:25,305 --> 02:02:25,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

1775
02:02:26,206 --> 02:02:30,749
[SPEAKER_09]: geek-life.com I left an uber comment on one of the stories this week.

1776
02:02:30,789 --> 02:02:31,750
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys were reminiscing.

1777
02:02:31,770 --> 02:02:32,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you were in it, Jamie.

1778
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:33,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember.

1779
02:02:33,371 --> 02:02:35,072
[SPEAKER_09]: But you guys were reminiscing about classic films.

1780
02:02:35,372 --> 02:02:36,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I picked Transformers the movie.

1781
02:02:37,133 --> 02:02:37,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, that's right.

1782
02:02:37,594 --> 02:02:38,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I do remember reading that.

1783
02:02:38,834 --> 02:02:42,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I left an epic comment about my love of a certain 80s movie.

1784
02:02:42,997 --> 02:02:43,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to pick Xanadu.

1785
02:02:45,606 --> 02:02:47,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I'd been able to go Xanadu Xanadu

1786
02:03:03,211 --> 02:03:06,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, are we done with the quick fire news here, rapid fire news?

1787
02:03:06,673 --> 02:03:07,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.

1788
02:03:07,434 --> 02:03:12,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're gonna get to Twitter topics, but first, I needed to play this for DarkSakura.

1789
02:03:12,557 --> 02:03:13,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry guys, I have to.

1790
02:03:14,958 --> 02:03:17,060
[SPEAKER_00]: She is waiting in her bed to be murdered by her husband.

1791
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:18,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, let me start this over.

1792
02:03:18,801 --> 02:03:20,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Meet Desdemona from Shakespeare's Othello.

1793
02:03:20,942 --> 02:03:23,064
[SPEAKER_00]: She is waiting in her bed to be murdered by her husband.

1794
02:03:23,424 --> 02:03:25,945
[SPEAKER_00]: This fate could have been avoided if she had a sassy gay friend.

1795
02:03:26,125 --> 02:03:27,006
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?

1796
02:03:27,486 --> 02:03:27,767
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

1797
02:03:28,227 --> 02:03:28,507
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

1798
02:03:28,947 --> 02:03:29,948
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you doing?

1799
02:03:34,002 --> 02:03:35,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Othello has ordered me to bed.

1800
02:03:35,523 --> 02:03:39,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, well he's also ordered a pillow at Bed Bath and Beyond that's good for smothering.

1801
02:03:39,747 --> 02:03:43,030
[SPEAKER_18]: So Tina Turner, we gotta private dance it outta here.

1802
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:44,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would he do that?

1803
02:03:44,451 --> 02:03:45,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been faithful to him.

1804
02:03:46,173 --> 02:03:49,876
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that, and you know that, but somehow your handkerchief ended up at Cassio's place.

1805
02:03:50,677 --> 02:03:54,961
[SPEAKER_18]: So now Othello thinks your fingers have been all over Cassio's keyboard, so we gotta go!

1806
02:03:55,421 --> 02:03:57,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I can understand why Othello would think that.

1807
02:03:58,083 --> 02:03:58,363
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

1808
02:03:59,004 --> 02:04:00,665
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, stop saying Othello.

1809
02:04:00,765 --> 02:04:01,685
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds pretentious.

1810
02:04:01,986 --> 02:04:03,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Second of all, what?

1811
02:04:03,887 --> 02:04:08,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Some guy ends up with your handkerchief so your husband gets to murder you?

1812
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:08,630
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1813
02:04:09,091 --> 02:04:10,952
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave a cough drop to King Lear last week.

1814
02:04:10,972 --> 02:04:12,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that mean I had sex with him?

1815
02:04:12,373 --> 02:04:12,613
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1816
02:04:12,953 --> 02:04:14,955
[SPEAKER_18]: And I never would, because one, he's crazy.

1817
02:04:15,095 --> 02:04:16,336
[SPEAKER_18]: Two, he wears pleated pants.

1818
02:04:16,636 --> 02:04:17,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Why are you still in the bed?

1819
02:04:17,957 --> 02:04:18,878
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, okay, you're right.

1820
02:04:18,898 --> 02:04:19,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go with you.

1821
02:04:19,298 --> 02:04:19,598
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.

1822
02:04:19,618 --> 02:04:20,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll go with you.

1823
02:04:20,839 --> 02:04:21,239
[SPEAKER_18]: Goodness.

1824
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:22,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Othello called me, though.

1825
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:23,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, God.

1826
02:04:24,713 --> 02:04:26,535
[SPEAKER_14]: He said I was false as hell.

1827
02:04:27,236 --> 02:04:28,377
[SPEAKER_18]: False as hell?

1828
02:04:28,798 --> 02:04:30,059
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, he is black.

1829
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:32,763
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of which, does more mean more?

1830
02:04:33,483 --> 02:04:35,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay, now I'm being racist.

1831
02:04:35,566 --> 02:04:36,807
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm such a stupid bitch.

1832
02:04:37,588 --> 02:04:38,910
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a stupid bitch.

1833
02:04:43,069 --> 02:04:43,530
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1834
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:44,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you've seen it.

1835
02:04:45,613 --> 02:04:47,896
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, that's the funniest one by far.

1836
02:04:48,197 --> 02:04:49,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Otello's the funniest one.

1837
02:04:49,699 --> 02:04:50,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't bother with the new one.

1838
02:04:50,881 --> 02:04:51,342
[SPEAKER_09]: It's terrible.

1839
02:04:51,422 --> 02:04:56,770
[SPEAKER_07]: What we need to do is harness the energy now from William Shakespeare rolling in his grave.

1840
02:04:56,970 --> 02:04:58,532
[SPEAKER_07]: We could power this show for a year.

1841
02:05:03,155 --> 02:05:18,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I apologize for ruining the show with Sassy Gayfriend Don't say it's hella, it makes you sound pretentious Look what I started That's gonna be me at work tomorrow Don't say that, it makes you sound pretentious Why are you still in the bed?

1842
02:05:18,905 --> 02:05:22,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright Hey, how about the tweets?

1843
02:05:27,196 --> 02:05:31,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR is where you can follow us on Twitter.

1844
02:05:31,718 --> 02:05:33,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can send us some tweets.

1845
02:05:33,399 --> 02:05:34,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Show us your tweets.

1846
02:05:34,779 --> 02:05:36,060
[SPEAKER_09]: We like it when you show us your tweets.

1847
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Some folks are tweeting us stories we already talked about tonight.

1848
02:05:39,421 --> 02:05:40,402
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1849
02:05:40,442 --> 02:05:43,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we're going to get to some of these in a little bit, like the story that Alpha Pananagram linked us.

1850
02:05:43,943 --> 02:05:44,964
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get to that in just a minute.

1851
02:05:46,324 --> 02:05:46,965
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's see.

1852
02:05:47,245 --> 02:05:49,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackson Man is passing along a congrats.

1853
02:05:49,986 --> 02:05:50,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Been a fan since 2004.

1854
02:05:51,708 --> 02:05:52,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Love you guys.

1855
02:05:52,409 --> 02:05:54,993
[SPEAKER_09]: You all make getting older easier to deal with.

1856
02:05:55,594 --> 02:05:56,795
[SPEAKER_09]: That's actually a really nice compliment.

1857
02:05:58,067 --> 02:06:02,529
[SPEAKER_09]: YYR wants us to know, Sharpshooter and Falling Score contests are open.

1858
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:04,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Win $20 in Microsoft Points.

1859
02:06:05,171 --> 02:06:06,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Both games now available.

1860
02:06:06,652 --> 02:06:13,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Details at www.yyrgames.com So Sharpshooter, I guess, got released finally.

1861
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:14,436
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

1862
02:06:14,716 --> 02:06:21,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he was showing that off at PAX East and looked kind of like the Hogan's Alley-ish kind of game, if you remember those.

1863
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to say maybe point blank, but a little bit like that.

1864
02:06:24,329 --> 02:06:25,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like fun.

1865
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:25,951
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

1866
02:06:26,011 --> 02:06:28,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I like shooting games that don't have a dog laughing at you.

1867
02:06:28,313 --> 02:06:30,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are indie games on Xbox Live, by the way.

1868
02:06:30,615 --> 02:06:31,576
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't play them on the web.

1869
02:06:31,596 --> 02:06:33,017
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to download them on the Xbox.

1870
02:06:33,037 --> 02:06:34,118
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're super cheap.

1871
02:06:34,158 --> 02:06:35,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, falling was like a buck.

1872
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:43,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Blade 3 says it would be cool if you could explain this whole iPhone 4 death grip thing I keep hearing about.

1873
02:06:43,427 --> 02:06:47,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I don't have an iPhone 4, but I... Yes?

1874
02:06:48,786 --> 02:06:50,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan and I actually wrote a press release about this.

1875
02:06:50,527 --> 02:06:51,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1876
02:06:52,629 --> 02:06:56,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, if you hold your iPhone forward in a particular way, you lose all reception.

1877
02:06:57,113 --> 02:06:57,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just by holding it.

1878
02:06:58,013 --> 02:06:59,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter what way you're pointing.

1879
02:06:59,815 --> 02:07:00,915
[SPEAKER_04]: It matters how you hold it.

1880
02:07:01,316 --> 02:07:04,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So when that was brought up to the powers that be, they said, Sorry.

1881
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:06,960
[SPEAKER_04]: In the press release.

1882
02:07:07,861 --> 02:07:08,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1883
02:07:08,661 --> 02:07:08,942
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1884
02:07:10,343 --> 02:07:10,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1885
02:07:10,523 --> 02:07:10,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1886
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:11,701
[SPEAKER_09]: and DarkSakura.com

1887
02:07:27,752 --> 02:07:38,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, alright, Redertainment tweets us, has Consumer Reports looked at the new 360 Slim, don't call it that, comparing it to the older 360 and the PS3 in relation to error rates and graphics?

1888
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:39,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they've had time.

1889
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:42,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, a lot of those types of things take time to really test.

1890
02:07:43,142 --> 02:07:46,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if they've really figured that out yet, but as far as Consumer Reports goes, no.

1891
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:51,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to hear though if the 360 has as bad of a failure rate, but we're not going to know for a year.

1892
02:07:52,307 --> 02:07:54,008
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it takes a little while for those things to fail.

1893
02:07:54,168 --> 02:07:54,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt it.

1894
02:07:54,488 --> 02:07:54,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a week.

1895
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:56,429
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

1896
02:07:56,529 --> 02:07:59,051
[SPEAKER_09]: My first Xbox I ever had failed in days.

1897
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:00,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

1898
02:08:00,292 --> 02:08:03,413
[SPEAKER_10]: They've already been showing some stuff about it.

1899
02:08:03,533 --> 02:08:08,236
[SPEAKER_10]: It will shut off if it gets too hot before it gets to the fail point.

1900
02:08:08,676 --> 02:08:09,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1901
02:08:31,161 --> 02:08:32,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was our last tweet, by the way.

1902
02:08:33,023 --> 02:08:36,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us a tweet to read in a future week.

1903
02:08:37,527 --> 02:08:41,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Cananagram in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com says, It's antenna basics.

1904
02:08:41,711 --> 02:08:44,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't touch antenna on radios else you lose reception.

1905
02:08:46,356 --> 02:08:48,918
[SPEAKER_09]: But are these people not using cases?

1906
02:08:49,219 --> 02:08:51,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe because the cases aren't really out yet?

1907
02:08:51,141 --> 02:08:51,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that...

1908
02:08:52,742 --> 02:08:55,042
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because I don't have a... Well, I don't know.

1909
02:08:55,082 --> 02:09:04,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they were fucking geniuses and put the antenna and the metals on the actual case instead of keeping it internal like everybody else.

1910
02:09:04,484 --> 02:09:15,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing about how they show the actual bars dropping, but I'm not hearing about, especially from my friends that own them and are using them, oh shit, I can't make calls because I'm not allowed to hold my phone.

1911
02:09:15,726 --> 02:09:16,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not hearing any of that.

1912
02:09:16,986 --> 02:09:20,167
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just hearing, oh, the indicator dropped from four to two bars.

1913
02:09:21,167 --> 02:09:24,490
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not hearing anyone saying, and it's affecting the quality of my call.

1914
02:09:25,050 --> 02:09:27,332
[SPEAKER_09]: No, AT&T is just affecting the quality of your call.

1915
02:09:27,512 --> 02:09:30,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's a whole other issue.

1916
02:09:30,455 --> 02:09:31,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a feature.

1917
02:09:31,576 --> 02:09:32,156
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a feature.

1918
02:09:33,297 --> 02:09:34,658
[SPEAKER_10]: It teaches you patience.

1919
02:09:35,619 --> 02:09:37,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on with some other news.

1920
02:09:37,881 --> 02:09:40,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I can't wait to hear you talk about this next story.

1921
02:09:41,574 --> 02:09:42,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes, the White House.

1922
02:09:42,674 --> 02:10:03,158
[SPEAKER_10]: They're planning on increasing FBI anti-piracy by employing over 50 special agents exclusively devoted to pursuing intellectual property investigations operating in field offices throughout the country and for enhanced intellectual property squads.

1923
02:10:05,059 --> 02:10:05,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes.

1924
02:10:05,859 --> 02:10:07,319
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's hilarious?

1925
02:10:07,639 --> 02:10:09,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of sort of ties in with this, I guess.

1926
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:10,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

1927
02:10:12,032 --> 02:10:15,494
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of piracy out there with BitTorrent and then, of course, Usenet.

1928
02:10:15,874 --> 02:10:22,297
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a website that I used to browse called Newsbin, one of the proprietors of the NZB format.

1929
02:10:24,158 --> 02:10:29,501
[SPEAKER_10]: They got in this big old lawsuit with MPA and stuff like that and got shut down.

1930
02:10:30,521 --> 02:10:31,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I check it today.

1931
02:10:31,422 --> 02:10:33,223
[SPEAKER_10]: NZB, or what was it?

1932
02:10:34,403 --> 02:10:36,665
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Newsbin 2 is back.

1933
02:10:36,845 --> 02:10:37,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like...

1934
02:10:39,531 --> 02:10:40,832
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1935
02:11:01,397 --> 02:11:01,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1936
02:11:02,578 --> 02:11:08,785
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to hear how that kind of affects, because don't most of these, if not all of these, pirate the huge operations run overseas?

1937
02:11:10,087 --> 02:11:17,374
[SPEAKER_10]: True, and I would think, if anything, these guys are going to be going after probably actual pirate... well, not actual piracy...

1938
02:11:18,155 --> 02:11:19,216
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1939
02:11:41,969 --> 02:11:42,750
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my guess.

1940
02:11:43,431 --> 02:11:44,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I could be wrong.

1941
02:11:44,212 --> 02:11:46,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're going to be employed by the NPA.

1942
02:11:46,334 --> 02:11:47,035
[SPEAKER_10]: That would make sense.

1943
02:11:47,495 --> 02:11:48,517
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean...

1944
02:11:50,370 --> 02:11:50,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Great!

1945
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:52,191
[SPEAKER_10]: More jobs, I guess.

1946
02:11:54,873 --> 02:12:01,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, the ESA, President Michael Gallagher, is very happy that they're doing this.

1947
02:12:02,017 --> 02:12:12,304
[SPEAKER_10]: We deeply appreciate the efforts of Vice President Biden and the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in their leadership and vision in this critical area.

1948
02:12:12,864 --> 02:12:18,228
[SPEAKER_10]: We also applaud the numerous federal departments and agencies that are committed to protecting intellectual property rights.

1949
02:12:19,308 --> 02:12:28,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Here and in foreign markets, both of which are critical to our industry's continued growth and ability to deliver innovative entertainment experiences.

1950
02:12:31,032 --> 02:12:37,475
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as Andrew said, it's not going to stop anything.

1951
02:12:37,715 --> 02:12:39,295
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to slow down anything.

1952
02:12:39,955 --> 02:12:41,156
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really not going to do anything.

1953
02:12:41,536 --> 02:12:43,337
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, 50 people have a job.

1954
02:12:44,137 --> 02:12:44,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1955
02:12:44,277 --> 02:12:44,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

1956
02:12:46,539 --> 02:12:47,460
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1957
02:13:07,378 --> 02:13:08,520
[SPEAKER_09]: DC Comics PlayStation Network

1958
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:23,040
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1959
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:25,582
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes sense because DC Universe is coming out soon.

1960
02:13:25,622 --> 02:13:26,623
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is kind of one of those.

1961
02:13:26,663 --> 02:13:27,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, of course.

1962
02:13:27,664 --> 02:13:38,032
[SPEAKER_09]: So DC Comics is actually coming to the PlayStation Network and you'll actually be able to use the PSP Digital Reader to read between 99 cents and $3 an issue over 80 different titles.

1963
02:13:38,512 --> 02:13:39,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Batman Hush.

1964
02:13:39,833 --> 02:14:00,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Green Lantern Rebirth also I guess there's an exclusive comic available on the PSN it is God of War and they're going to be doing a Resistance comic and Free Realms and I guess a joint Superman Batman title that's only on PSN kind of interesting there's a free 10 page preview of the 700th issue of Superman available on the store now

1965
02:14:01,658 --> 02:14:02,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a fan, DarkSakura?

1966
02:14:02,978 --> 02:14:04,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a DC fan.

1967
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:16,901
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing that made me remotely interested in reading anything DC was The Blackest Night, and I tried to read that, and I was like, this is stupid.

1968
02:14:18,981 --> 02:14:26,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked some of the writing, I thought it was kind of neat, but for the most part, I just look at most DC stuff and go, brain hurt, miss my Marvel.

1969
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:28,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

1970
02:14:44,736 --> 02:14:49,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like... I... I will... Okay, okay.

1971
02:14:50,138 --> 02:14:52,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to explain what my love-hate with DC is.

1972
02:14:52,919 --> 02:14:53,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1973
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:55,459
[SPEAKER_04]: They have great characters.

1974
02:14:56,620 --> 02:14:57,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Shitty storylines.

1975
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:01,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Reinvent the universe every, you know, five minutes.

1976
02:15:03,182 --> 02:15:07,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, at least Marvel tries to maintain some degree of continuity along their lines.

1977
02:15:08,403 --> 02:15:09,284
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the comics?

1978
02:15:10,104 --> 02:15:10,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1979
02:15:10,284 --> 02:15:10,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

1980
02:15:11,993 --> 02:15:37,243
[SPEAKER_04]: they try to have continuity in at least one of the comics the other ones go batshit crazy though we have a set universe for this one there are other universes and sometimes they cross over a little bit but you're not completely reinventing the main universe that the stories are told in and on top of that, honestly, they have some really hokey characters and I just could not get into it

1981
02:15:37,543 --> 02:15:38,984
[SPEAKER_04]: and if you like DC, good for you.

1982
02:15:39,124 --> 02:15:39,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you like it.

1983
02:15:40,245 --> 02:15:40,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Make mine Marvel.

1984
02:15:41,725 --> 02:15:43,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say though, Marvel vs. Capcom 3 looks pretty sweet.

1985
02:15:44,167 --> 02:15:44,907
[SPEAKER_23]: Hell yeah.

1986
02:15:45,347 --> 02:15:49,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, don't worry if there's a continuity snarl in DC.

1987
02:15:49,890 --> 02:15:52,091
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll just have Superboy Prime punch reality.

1988
02:15:54,152 --> 02:15:59,015
[SPEAKER_04]: No, next time they decide that they don't like the universe, they'll just have another crisis or whatever the crap they do.

1989
02:16:00,101 --> 02:16:06,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Salacious Pop in our chatroom says DC equals meh, DC Vertigo equals A++++ Vertigo, yes.

1990
02:16:06,743 --> 02:16:14,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Vertigo, now I love, I have the Sandman book that Amano did the art for.

1991
02:16:15,545 --> 02:16:17,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I love The High Cost of Living.

1992
02:16:17,606 --> 02:16:19,046
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of my favorites.

1993
02:16:19,286 --> 02:16:22,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I am totally down with the Vertigo books.

1994
02:16:23,107 --> 02:16:32,517
[SPEAKER_04]: But the main DC, the only thing that I have ever really, and this is my one thing that made me happy, was just Batman and his thing complaining about everybody.

1995
02:16:32,557 --> 02:16:33,538
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, do they know who I am?

1996
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:34,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the goddamn Batman.

1997
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:36,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And he hates chocolate.

1998
02:16:36,862 --> 02:16:41,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And Flaming Toilet in our chat room says, all Marvel does is have their flagship character make a deal with the devil.

1999
02:16:42,228 --> 02:16:42,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

2000
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:44,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

2001
02:16:44,490 --> 02:16:44,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

2002
02:16:44,771 --> 02:16:44,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

2003
02:16:45,934 --> 02:16:47,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

2004
02:16:47,156 --> 02:16:53,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say I'm not as happy with the Spider-Man books as I used to be, but Spider-Man and the Avengers is freaking sweet.

2005
02:16:54,425 --> 02:16:55,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

2006
02:16:55,166 --> 02:16:56,948
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you got another news story for us.

2007
02:16:56,988 --> 02:16:59,451
[SPEAKER_09]: It has nothing to do with comic books, but it's still cool.

2008
02:17:00,132 --> 02:17:00,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, anyway.

2009
02:17:01,273 --> 02:17:03,136
[SPEAKER_09]: When I heard about this, I was like, oh, cool.

2010
02:17:03,872 --> 02:17:05,133
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty cool.

2011
02:17:05,853 --> 02:17:11,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the silver lining is actually going to be complete.

2012
02:17:11,676 --> 02:17:12,216
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

2013
02:17:12,236 --> 02:17:13,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Phoenix Online.

2014
02:17:14,917 --> 02:17:19,840
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on this, actually, as a King's Quest sequel, and we talked with them, and we thought they were cool.

2015
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:20,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they were.

2016
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:22,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have them on the show?

2017
02:17:22,081 --> 02:17:22,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even remember.

2018
02:17:22,841 --> 02:17:24,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I went to one of their pressy things.

2019
02:17:24,322 --> 02:17:26,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we did have them on the show years ago.

2020
02:17:26,643 --> 02:17:26,983
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

2021
02:17:27,504 --> 02:17:30,125
[SPEAKER_09]: This was before the first time they got shut down by Vivendi.

2022
02:17:30,666 --> 02:17:32,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2023
02:17:32,387 --> 02:17:34,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there's actually, the website is up.

2024
02:17:34,589 --> 02:17:41,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.tsl-game.com and they basically are coming back.

2025
02:17:41,954 --> 02:17:45,697
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a release date of July 10th and made the big statement about it.

2026
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:59,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now it's not, you know, still not King's Quest, but you will be able to assume the role of King Graham when he saves his children, Rosella and Alexander.

2027
02:17:59,907 --> 02:18:01,187
[SPEAKER_04]: From a mysterious curse.

2028
02:18:01,327 --> 02:18:03,048
[SPEAKER_09]: But they don't call it King's Quest.

2029
02:18:03,108 --> 02:18:04,588
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of one of those wink wink.

2030
02:18:05,288 --> 02:18:05,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2031
02:18:07,769 --> 02:18:10,329
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what the best thing about this whole thing is?

2032
02:18:11,370 --> 02:18:11,970
[SPEAKER_09]: It's free.

2033
02:18:12,310 --> 02:18:13,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2034
02:18:14,570 --> 02:18:15,831
[SPEAKER_09]: And who here likes free?

2035
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:16,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Me.

2036
02:18:17,671 --> 02:18:18,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's hand is not up.

2037
02:18:18,771 --> 02:18:19,732
[SPEAKER_09]: How is this possible?

2038
02:18:19,952 --> 02:18:20,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, he raised it.

2039
02:18:20,832 --> 02:18:22,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, Yaris doesn't count.

2040
02:18:23,133 --> 02:18:24,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Yaris doesn't count.

2041
02:18:24,313 --> 02:18:25,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's episodic.

2042
02:18:26,724 --> 02:18:27,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, please.

2043
02:18:28,385 --> 02:18:38,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Even that little demo I played of Silver Lining back when the guy was on the show with the interview like four or five years ago, the little demo we played was better than Yaris by leaps and bounds.

2044
02:18:38,129 --> 02:18:40,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm sure the full game is plenty fine.

2045
02:18:41,791 --> 02:18:43,572
[SPEAKER_04]: The art in the game is pretty gorgeous, too.

2046
02:18:45,513 --> 02:18:45,813
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2047
02:18:46,734 --> 02:18:47,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what you got for us?

2048
02:18:48,844 --> 02:18:51,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there's some interesting stuff coming from Konami.

2049
02:18:51,905 --> 02:18:57,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Mainly just talk about Metal Gear and how well it's going to do for them.

2050
02:18:58,247 --> 02:19:02,068
[SPEAKER_10]: They expect that Metal Gear Solid, the Peace Walker, to sell 3 million copies.

2051
02:19:04,668 --> 02:19:06,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is according to their expectations.

2052
02:19:07,489 --> 02:19:13,731
[SPEAKER_10]: And predicting, I guess they're saying that... I wonder if they're talking about 3 million copies...

2053
02:19:16,063 --> 02:19:17,184
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it must not be this month.

2054
02:19:17,704 --> 02:19:18,965
[SPEAKER_10]: No way that it's going to sell that many.

2055
02:19:20,166 --> 02:19:24,688
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also talking about Metal Gear Arcade, which we had heard a little bit about.

2056
02:19:26,129 --> 02:19:30,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, it was delayed since it didn't come out in March as it was originally released.

2057
02:19:31,672 --> 02:19:41,558
[SPEAKER_10]: The company, though, is putting some extra time on the title, which apparently... I think it's only coming out in arcades in Japan.

2058
02:19:41,578 --> 02:19:41,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Japan.

2059
02:19:43,683 --> 02:19:45,624
[SPEAKER_10]: But at least it's still on the way.

2060
02:19:47,044 --> 02:19:47,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of neat.

2061
02:19:48,085 --> 02:19:54,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, it's a bummer all the arcades here have just turned into ticket spitters because some of these games sound sweet.

2062
02:19:55,528 --> 02:19:55,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2063
02:19:57,629 --> 02:20:03,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, another bit of Konami related news has to do with Castlevania Harmony of Despair.

2064
02:20:03,933 --> 02:20:07,576
[SPEAKER_09]: You might remember this was the Xbox Live title that was shown at E3.

2065
02:20:07,616 --> 02:20:15,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of the Symphony of the Night style graphics, but now it's like a multiplayer and I talked about the Neo Geo effect where things like zoom in and out and all that fun stuff.

2066
02:20:15,821 --> 02:20:26,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's kind of funny because I kind of got into some words on Twitter this week with somebody who's very anti-Microsoft and is kind of pissed off that Konami won't release this on PSN.

2067
02:20:26,508 --> 02:20:26,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Well,

2068
02:20:27,549 --> 02:20:28,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Hint, hint, hint.

2069
02:20:44,341 --> 02:20:51,891
[SPEAKER_09]: But my thought is, okay, so how are the Sony fanboys who hate Microsoft supposed to get the Microsoft version of this to sell?

2070
02:20:53,073 --> 02:20:54,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Does not compute.

2071
02:20:54,595 --> 02:20:58,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the same time, why not just really, I mean, is the game that hard to port?

2072
02:20:58,460 --> 02:20:59,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get it.

2073
02:20:59,061 --> 02:20:59,521
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the problem?

2074
02:21:01,761 --> 02:21:16,151
[SPEAKER_09]: All these other arcade games come out for both all the time I don't know, that comment from Igarashi just kind of I mean, I hate to say it, but it sucks Like, there's something else there he's not saying Something about the business or something, I don't know

2075
02:21:19,053 --> 02:21:30,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they think people in Japan aren't going to play this because it's on Xbox Live and they're really worried about how it's received and so they don't want to go to PlayStation Network because that's how everybody will buy it in Japan.

2076
02:21:31,657 --> 02:21:32,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it be that?

2077
02:21:34,218 --> 02:21:34,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2078
02:21:39,119 --> 02:21:41,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, I guess we'll never know.

2079
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:42,360
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to see how the game sells.

2080
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:48,782
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the bright side, PSN fans, it is part of that whole Summer of Arcade thing going on so, you know,

2081
02:21:50,071 --> 02:21:51,672
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably will do pretty well.

2082
02:21:52,632 --> 02:21:53,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2083
02:21:53,593 --> 02:21:59,336
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, My guess is it's Konami playing favorites or something similar to what happened in the SNES Genesis days.

2084
02:21:59,976 --> 02:22:04,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It just seems so weird for companies nowadays to just come out and say, Well, we love this system best.

2085
02:22:05,299 --> 02:22:11,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though that's kind of what happened at the Sony press conference when Gabe from Valve came out and said, The best version of Portal 2 will be on the PS3.

2086
02:22:13,464 --> 02:22:14,144
[SPEAKER_09]: In so many words.

2087
02:22:15,705 --> 02:22:16,345
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2088
02:22:17,946 --> 02:22:19,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Were you asleep last week?

2089
02:22:20,276 --> 02:22:23,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but the only reason they say... I know, it still boggles the mind.

2090
02:22:23,197 --> 02:22:26,058
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's why they say it's the best version of Portal 2.

2091
02:22:26,358 --> 02:22:27,699
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because it has Steam.

2092
02:22:27,939 --> 02:22:29,119
[SPEAKER_10]: And he got paid a lot of money.

2093
02:22:29,859 --> 02:22:30,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that too.

2094
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:33,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was during the PlayStation press conference.

2095
02:22:34,141 --> 02:22:34,581
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be funny.

2096
02:22:34,601 --> 02:22:36,702
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, Fuck y'all, it's gonna be Xbox 360.

2097
02:22:36,742 --> 02:22:38,062
[SPEAKER_10]: See ya.

2098
02:22:39,723 --> 02:22:41,383
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but that's the only reason why.

2099
02:22:41,423 --> 02:22:42,384
[SPEAKER_10]: It's because of Steam.

2100
02:22:44,104 --> 02:22:48,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Steam is wonderful on PC, but I don't give a flying fuck about Steam on PlayStation 3, so...

2101
02:22:49,372 --> 02:22:50,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's interesting.

2102
02:22:50,452 --> 02:22:57,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the news about the Steam cloud support is almost in a way more interesting than what was said about Portal.

2103
02:22:57,194 --> 02:22:57,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

2104
02:22:58,314 --> 02:22:59,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Cloud support!

2105
02:22:59,115 --> 02:23:00,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I can take my save game with me!

2106
02:23:01,335 --> 02:23:04,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I really go play in other people's houses on the PlayStation 3s?

2107
02:23:04,236 --> 02:23:04,416
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2108
02:23:04,616 --> 02:23:05,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I actually play in my PlayStation 3?

2109
02:23:06,276 --> 02:23:06,496
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2110
02:23:06,777 --> 02:23:09,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So why do I even care about the stupid cloud support?

2111
02:23:09,617 --> 02:23:10,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people do.

2112
02:23:10,537 --> 02:23:12,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Could they work with the PC versions of the game?

2113
02:23:12,318 --> 02:23:14,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I go to Alan's house and back all the time.

2114
02:23:15,059 --> 02:23:16,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I would benefit from that.

2115
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:20,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to go, you know, play games at my friend's house a while back.

2116
02:23:20,261 --> 02:23:24,304
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, wouldn't this have been great when we were all doing our big Bimani swap?

2117
02:23:24,664 --> 02:23:25,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

2118
02:23:25,885 --> 02:23:27,506
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got everyone's unlocks, yay!

2119
02:23:29,848 --> 02:23:33,510
[SPEAKER_10]: You can just also easily copy a save onto a memory card.

2120
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:35,772
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

2121
02:23:36,432 --> 02:23:37,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the mailbag!

2122
02:23:44,252 --> 02:23:52,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week you guys email us at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of your emails and read them here on the show for you guys.

2123
02:23:52,738 --> 02:23:54,299
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to read some of our favorites.

2124
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:59,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm taking you over for DarkSakura for one more week and she'll be back to reading next week.

2125
02:24:00,284 --> 02:24:00,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the week after.

2126
02:24:00,964 --> 02:24:04,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as you can tell, my voice is a lot better, but it's not 100%.

2127
02:24:06,570 --> 02:24:10,293
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, we got some quick emails tonight here, so we're just gonna get through these real quick.

2128
02:24:10,573 --> 02:24:11,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, look at this.

2129
02:24:11,634 --> 02:24:23,622
[SPEAKER_09]: One of our very frequent emailers got his account hacked, because, hi, I would like to recommend you a very good company, and the website is blah blah blah blah blah, cell phones, LCDs, oh, you poor thing.

2130
02:24:23,962 --> 02:24:25,463
[SPEAKER_09]: That's been happening a lot to people lately.

2131
02:24:25,583 --> 02:24:26,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that weird?

2132
02:24:27,785 --> 02:24:29,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I bet you guys really care about that.

2133
02:24:29,506 --> 02:24:30,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch your emails!

2134
02:24:31,648 --> 02:24:35,731
[SPEAKER_09]: This email comes to us from TheShadowSniper, and it's not spam.

2135
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:42,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Just started playing Final Fantasy XIII a couple days ago and I'm about 9-10 hours in the game and there's nothing wrong with it.

2136
02:24:42,592 --> 02:24:44,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know why people are complaining about it.

2137
02:24:44,333 --> 02:24:48,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a gamer for over 10 years and I've seen much worse games than Final Fantasy XIII.

2138
02:24:48,795 --> 02:24:53,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I agree, it could have been better, but you can't really expect to have games tailored exactly to your needs.

2139
02:24:53,837 --> 02:24:54,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

2140
02:24:54,457 --> 02:24:56,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Because every gamer will have a different view of any game.

2141
02:24:57,558 --> 02:25:09,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, expecting a game to be absolutely amazing will only add to the disappointment when you realize it's not exactly what you wanted and it's not always about what we want because it's impossible to have games tailored exactly to what we want.

2142
02:25:09,584 --> 02:25:10,684
[SPEAKER_09]: We can only hope for the best.

2143
02:25:11,305 --> 02:25:14,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, too much hype and expecting too much will only add to the disappointment.

2144
02:25:14,626 --> 02:25:15,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry for the long read.

2145
02:25:15,687 --> 02:25:17,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I could go on and on, but let's just leave it at that.

2146
02:25:17,868 --> 02:25:18,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys have a good night.

2147
02:25:18,988 --> 02:25:20,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, TheShadowSniper.

2148
02:25:20,589 --> 02:25:26,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, a lot of people were hating on Final Fantasy XIII, but you know, it did, it was really slow to build.

2149
02:25:26,835 --> 02:25:32,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I think, you know, and this game's been out a couple months now, but I realize, you know, with price drops and everything, folks get into it later on down the road.

2150
02:25:33,361 --> 02:25:43,831
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like, it's like a, I think I called it like a banana or a piece of fruit that peels back its layers very slowly to show all the, you know, different components of it.

2151
02:25:44,355 --> 02:25:46,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy games usually take a little while to get going.

2152
02:25:46,916 --> 02:25:48,937
[SPEAKER_09]: But XIII especially so.

2153
02:25:50,057 --> 02:25:50,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Just saying.

2154
02:25:51,978 --> 02:25:54,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually thought though Final Fantasy XIII had a lot in common with VII.

2155
02:25:54,679 --> 02:25:57,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean VII was very linear in the beginning of the game too.

2156
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:00,581
[SPEAKER_09]: And nobody hated on that as much as they're hating on XIII.

2157
02:26:00,621 --> 02:26:01,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually I take that back.

2158
02:26:01,861 --> 02:26:04,082
[SPEAKER_09]: There's very vocal people that hate on VII quite a bit.

2159
02:26:04,282 --> 02:26:05,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody hated on it back then.

2160
02:26:05,942 --> 02:26:07,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, they didn't hate on it.

2161
02:26:07,543 --> 02:26:10,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, at the time it was revolutionary.

2162
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:13,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to another email.

2163
02:26:13,679 --> 02:26:14,599
[SPEAKER_09]: We got two emails left.

2164
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:19,380
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is from... He does not really have a nickname, but he signed it Colby, so we'll go with that.

2165
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:21,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Colby, hello OLR crew.

2166
02:26:21,781 --> 02:26:23,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice.

2167
02:26:23,961 --> 02:26:26,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm visiting the Rockland Roseville area.

2168
02:26:26,262 --> 02:26:27,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is a local question.

2169
02:26:27,682 --> 02:26:28,762
[SPEAKER_09]: To visit my friend Chris.

2170
02:26:29,282 --> 02:26:30,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if he wanted this read on air.

2171
02:26:31,043 --> 02:26:34,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, the guy who worked at John's Incredible Pizza and recognized you guys a while back.

2172
02:26:34,864 --> 02:26:35,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

2173
02:26:35,404 --> 02:26:35,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.

2174
02:26:36,024 --> 02:26:36,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I remember that.

2175
02:26:36,724 --> 02:26:37,124
[SPEAKER_03]: He was cool.

2176
02:26:37,805 --> 02:26:40,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if you guys could give me some ideas for things to do.

2177
02:26:40,107 --> 02:26:44,531
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already been to the Golfland Arcade, San Francisco, including the Metreon in Japantown.

2178
02:26:44,932 --> 02:26:46,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry you had to see the Metreon.

2179
02:26:47,234 --> 02:26:48,715
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have seen the Metreon years ago.

2180
02:26:49,096 --> 02:26:49,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And Cusar.

2181
02:26:50,317 --> 02:26:54,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like we have similar tastes and hobbies in general, so I figure there's no one better to ask than you guys.

2182
02:26:55,495 --> 02:26:57,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, tough questions.

2183
02:26:58,057 --> 02:26:58,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Stars?

2184
02:26:59,879 --> 02:27:00,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that the name of the place?

2185
02:27:00,740 --> 02:27:01,781
[SPEAKER_09]: The place in Vacaville?

2186
02:27:01,961 --> 02:27:02,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been there in years.

2187
02:27:02,862 --> 02:27:03,623
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not Vacaville.

2188
02:27:03,643 --> 02:27:06,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the place, the bowling alley in Roseville.

2189
02:27:06,585 --> 02:27:08,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, the bowling alley out in Rockland, Roseville.

2190
02:27:08,627 --> 02:27:10,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Stars, I think.

2191
02:27:10,589 --> 02:27:11,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the name of it.

2192
02:27:11,918 --> 02:27:13,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Starz is in Vacaville.

2193
02:27:13,839 --> 02:27:14,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Starz is the Vacaville.

2194
02:27:14,740 --> 02:27:16,401
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one in Rockland, though.

2195
02:27:16,581 --> 02:27:16,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Strikes.

2196
02:27:17,222 --> 02:27:17,802
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2197
02:27:17,882 --> 02:27:18,583
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good place.

2198
02:27:18,743 --> 02:27:19,483
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a good arcade.

2199
02:27:19,984 --> 02:27:22,725
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like the nerdy stuff, Dave & Buster's is now open in Roseville.

2200
02:27:23,086 --> 02:27:24,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear it's not that great.

2201
02:27:24,486 --> 02:27:26,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been there myself yet, but I hear it's kind of eh.

2202
02:27:27,428 --> 02:27:31,831
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to go to the Jelly Belly Factory out in Fairfield.

2203
02:27:32,112 --> 02:27:35,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody visiting NorCal has got to go to the Jelly Belly Factory and get them some belly flops.

2204
02:27:36,154 --> 02:27:48,161
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're thinking about trekking back over to the Bay Area, if you didn't do the Tea Gardens, I know you said you went to Japantown, but if you didn't do the Japanese Tea Gardens, which are closer, I believe, to Golden Gate Park than Japantown is, you gotta check that out.

2205
02:27:48,361 --> 02:27:48,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Beautiful.

2206
02:27:48,842 --> 02:27:50,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And the pier.

2207
02:27:50,282 --> 02:27:51,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Pier 39 is a great tourist trap.

2208
02:27:52,104 --> 02:27:52,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Have the donuts.

2209
02:27:53,937 --> 02:28:14,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and um In the bucket Get the donuts in the plastic bucket They're amazing If you haven't though If you haven't ever eaten at a Bubba Gump's And you really like seafood They're actually pretty good And they have a pomegranate margarita That is amazing If Riptide's still there on the pier No, they're not They got replaced by a sports bar It's been a while Yeah They got replaced by a sports bar There's a sports bar there now At least last time I was there

2210
02:28:15,755 --> 02:28:19,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I was there like... We did a live broadcast from there when it was... Yeah.

2211
02:28:19,177 --> 02:28:20,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind.

2212
02:28:20,277 --> 02:28:21,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It's back from B3.

2213
02:28:21,598 --> 02:28:21,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

2214
02:28:23,058 --> 02:28:27,980
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was when Megumi and I left to go to Japan town on the last day.

2215
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:29,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2216
02:28:29,161 --> 02:28:36,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Colby didn't say where he was from, so I don't know what he gets in his neck of the woods, but it might be worth it, especially if you're coming during this time of year, drive up the other way.

2217
02:28:36,264 --> 02:28:41,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of going to the bay, drive up the hill and go to Tahoe because they've got some gambling if you're into that, but...

2218
02:28:41,966 --> 02:28:42,406
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

2219
02:29:03,383 --> 02:29:03,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of good stuff.

2220
02:29:03,863 --> 02:29:05,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Fort Bragg or something like that.

2221
02:29:05,443 --> 02:29:07,344
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was a very local question.

2222
02:29:07,484 --> 02:29:08,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we gave you some good ideas.

2223
02:29:09,744 --> 02:29:13,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like he mentioned a lot of nerdy things, so I was trying to make sure we got all the nerd spots out.

2224
02:29:13,925 --> 02:29:14,365
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we did.

2225
02:29:14,385 --> 02:29:21,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do have to say, though, it is... And this is... Kristen and I, we went to Point Reyes and missed the lighthouse while it was open.

2226
02:29:21,807 --> 02:29:27,988
[SPEAKER_04]: But we just sat out on this cliff face, looking out over the ocean, watching the mule deer play, and it was awesome.

2227
02:29:29,028 --> 02:29:48,240
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a couple days to play with, drive to Disneyland Alright, let's see, let's move on Ray Ayanami saying go to SVGL and play Technica They have that at Roseville Golf Land now, granted it's broken, but you know, still What isn't?

2228
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:53,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, moving on, let's go to this last email here

2229
02:29:55,126 --> 02:30:00,486
[SPEAKER_09]: and this email is from is there a signature somewhere here?

2230
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:27,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey OLR, this is MC here, I've never called you guys up on Skype, rarely participated in chat, and certainly never sent an email your way before However, with this being your 8th anniversary and all, I figured it was time to finally jump in and say hello But more so to say thanks for the years of enjoyment you've brought to me and the countless others of the OL Army I first began tuning into OLR somewhere in 2003 Wow, this is this guy's first email

2231
02:30:27,774 --> 02:30:28,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2232
02:30:28,134 --> 02:30:28,675
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

2233
02:30:28,815 --> 02:30:29,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for writing us.

2234
02:30:30,416 --> 02:30:32,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I wish you'd done it sooner.

2235
02:30:32,337 --> 02:30:32,757
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

2236
02:30:33,118 --> 02:30:37,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, if I remember how I even found out about you guys, but I think someone mentioned it on a forum.

2237
02:30:38,321 --> 02:30:39,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe my DDR freak, Sig.

2238
02:30:39,922 --> 02:30:40,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, it could have been me.

2239
02:30:41,363 --> 02:30:46,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just gotten a PS2 and DDR Max 2 for a middle school graduation gift and fell in love.

2240
02:30:46,506 --> 02:30:54,752
[SPEAKER_09]: None of my friends were especially interested in rhythm games, much less DDR, so OLR satiated my need for conversation on my favorite topic, music games.

2241
02:30:55,592 --> 02:31:00,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd listen whenever possible and upon the advent of the to-go edition, I would download them overnight.

2242
02:31:00,857 --> 02:31:02,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, dial-up connection.

2243
02:31:02,458 --> 02:31:04,019
[SPEAKER_09]: And listen away during classes.

2244
02:31:04,460 --> 02:31:08,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps this was detrimental to my grade a bit, but it didn't matter because I had more OLR.

2245
02:31:09,524 --> 02:31:10,185
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really sweet.

2246
02:31:11,786 --> 02:31:18,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Then came the day when it became official that OLR was no longer solely a music game show, but one for all video games.

2247
02:31:18,893 --> 02:31:20,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's when I stopped listening.

2248
02:31:20,054 --> 02:31:20,434
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

2249
02:31:21,936 --> 02:31:26,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, other games had always come into the dialogue of the show, but my young self felt a little betrayed.

2250
02:31:27,421 --> 02:31:27,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's sweet.

2251
02:31:52,182 --> 02:32:20,574
[SPEAKER_09]: you know what's funny though he really does have a point like if we wanted to be a music games only show or maybe like a website it would be really easy to do that in fact yeah I've thought about maybe we should take our website back in that direction have a little fun with it kind of like kind of like a site like DDR Freak Bomani style but you know with our eyes open to the fact that you know American audiences play other games too you know I mean maybe yeah but Bomani style kind of does that now they do they do to their credit they do

2252
02:32:21,238 --> 02:32:23,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had thoughts on this before.

2253
02:32:23,748 --> 02:32:25,455
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something we'll have to discuss offline.

2254
02:32:26,354 --> 02:32:36,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember tuning in for episode 100 and thinking just how awesome it was that the show had lasted that long.

2255
02:32:36,462 --> 02:32:39,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I ever expected it to still be around as I inched towards the age of 21.

2256
02:32:40,925 --> 02:32:43,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, who could have ever predicted it would get into episodes in the 300s?

2257
02:32:44,187 --> 02:32:48,751
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beyond awesome that you all have the dedication to continue this show and I'm beyond thankful that it's been around.

2258
02:32:49,211 --> 02:32:54,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure almost everyone, if not all, who listens regularly would reiterate this sentiment in a heartbeat.

2259
02:32:54,555 --> 02:32:55,556
[SPEAKER_09]: We love you, OLR.

2260
02:32:55,916 --> 02:32:56,378
[SPEAKER_09]: No homo.

2261
02:32:57,641 --> 02:32:58,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Rob.

2262
02:33:01,636 --> 02:33:05,058
[SPEAKER_09]: There actually is an extra note for me.

2263
02:33:05,338 --> 02:33:08,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a note for Rob in particular, so feel free to skip on reading this a bit.

2264
02:33:08,739 --> 02:33:09,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Extra stage, Rob.

2265
02:33:09,980 --> 02:33:10,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I read this anyway?

2266
02:33:11,060 --> 02:33:13,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

2267
02:33:13,461 --> 02:33:18,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to personally thank you, not for OLR, but for being who you are.

2268
02:33:18,984 --> 02:33:22,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that sounds awfully saccharine, but there's reason for me saying this.

2269
02:33:22,245 --> 02:33:27,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Throughout high school, I never had any gay friends, and I didn't know anyone in my family who fell anywhere on the LGBT spectrum.

2270
02:33:27,928 --> 02:33:29,829
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I sure as hell knew I was gay.

2271
02:33:30,549 --> 02:33:30,849
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

2272
02:33:52,950 --> 02:33:58,495
[SPEAKER_09]: happened with or without my listening to OLR, but you really helped me realize it was okay to be me.

2273
02:33:58,996 --> 02:34:02,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Rob, I love you in a purely platonic gay bro sort of way.

2274
02:34:02,979 --> 02:34:03,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for reading.

2275
02:34:04,521 --> 02:34:05,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That's... That's awesome.

2276
02:34:05,882 --> 02:34:06,342
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sweet.

2277
02:34:06,562 --> 02:34:08,164
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very... You know...

2278
02:34:10,054 --> 02:34:37,142
[SPEAKER_09]: earlier in the show I talked about some very unfortunate things that have happened because of OLR but for every bad thing that happens like that there's moments like that and just knowing that there is not just this one particular email but a whole community of people who I know really do support this show and everything we do here the good outweighs the bad

2279
02:34:38,403 --> 02:34:41,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that case, the pure evil, honestly.

2280
02:34:43,209 --> 02:34:44,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually really awesome.

2281
02:34:45,112 --> 02:34:46,413
[SPEAKER_09]: That was wonderful.

2282
02:34:46,654 --> 02:34:48,196
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a great birthday present.

2283
02:34:48,496 --> 02:34:52,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, guys, over eight years, you've touched more hearts and minds than you realize.

2284
02:34:52,443 --> 02:34:53,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've touched parts.

2285
02:34:54,845 --> 02:34:55,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And other parts.

2286
02:34:55,745 --> 02:35:04,351
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little weird to think about because I'm kind of like, well, you know, it's not like we're freaking, you know, Oprah or, you know, a huge show watched by millions.

2287
02:35:04,411 --> 02:35:11,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's neat to think that despite the little group we have here has been so thankful.

2288
02:35:11,216 --> 02:35:12,556
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we really do feel that.

2289
02:35:12,937 --> 02:35:13,957
[SPEAKER_09]: It really is the motivation.

2290
02:35:13,977 --> 02:35:18,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'll tell you what, I can't tell you how many times I've been like, and why am I doing this?

2291
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:22,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Why am I rushing home from San Francisco to do this show tonight again?

2292
02:35:22,864 --> 02:35:26,973
[SPEAKER_09]: and then an email like that shows up and you're like, oh yeah, that's why.

2293
02:35:27,369 --> 02:35:31,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and we've all made a lot of good friends through the show, too.

2294
02:35:31,552 --> 02:35:35,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Ranma's been slept in my futon.

2295
02:35:37,836 --> 02:35:39,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, come all that way.

2296
02:35:40,178 --> 02:35:43,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and Misty's come and, you know.

2297
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:47,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've met hella people at just shows, which has been great.

2298
02:35:47,242 --> 02:35:56,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, just recently at PAX East, there were some people, Gold Anthro, I believe, was telling me, like, dude, because of your show, I started doing podcasting stuff.

2299
02:35:56,629 --> 02:35:56,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like,

2300
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a better compliment you can get?

2301
02:36:00,051 --> 02:36:00,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes or no?

2302
02:36:00,611 --> 02:36:01,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there really isn't.

2303
02:36:01,592 --> 02:36:05,314
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's just awesome.

2304
02:36:05,834 --> 02:36:19,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one thing that I really want to owe to the show, if I may, is that it actually did a lot in dealing with a little personal self-esteem issue that I used to have where I would freak out if anyone said anything negative about me.

2305
02:36:20,603 --> 02:36:23,345
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would always say, yeah, I don't care, I don't care.

2306
02:36:23,405 --> 02:36:24,806
[SPEAKER_04]: But after actually getting hate mail...

2307
02:36:25,826 --> 02:36:26,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I laugh.

2308
02:36:27,427 --> 02:36:31,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like, really cemented it for me that these people don't know who I am, I don't care.

2309
02:36:32,390 --> 02:36:39,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that, getting so much more positive in return and having people go on other forums to smack people down.

2310
02:36:40,335 --> 02:36:43,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just watching it going, that's so cool.

2311
02:36:45,508 --> 02:36:46,669
[SPEAKER_09]: It's quite interesting.

2312
02:36:47,090 --> 02:36:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and I'm not saying that I'm really the retaliatory type anymore.

2313
02:36:52,834 --> 02:36:57,018
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, just having people that'll just jump to your defense like that, too, is pretty cool.

2314
02:36:58,959 --> 02:37:02,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Abochi Kawan Chat says, Everyone group hug.

2315
02:37:02,642 --> 02:37:05,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Black Wolf says, I was inspired by OLR back in the day.

2316
02:37:05,465 --> 02:37:06,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And that just, like, blows my fucking mind.

2317
02:37:07,046 --> 02:37:08,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when I listen to Bobby...

2318
02:37:08,827 --> 02:37:10,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like he's been doing what he's done.

2319
02:37:11,348 --> 02:37:16,269
[SPEAKER_09]: At least, I would think, just listening, he's been doing what he's been doing just as long as we've been doing our show.

2320
02:37:16,849 --> 02:37:20,730
[SPEAKER_09]: So to hear that he was inspired by us is kind of strange to me.

2321
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:22,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaming Toilets' first show was the fuck show.

2322
02:37:26,891 --> 02:37:30,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep in mind, everybody, there's going to be more to come.

2323
02:37:30,768 --> 02:37:34,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And Flaming Toilet also says hate mail just means you've arrived.

2324
02:37:34,470 --> 02:37:35,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

2325
02:37:35,211 --> 02:37:38,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know how many times I tried to tell DarkSakura that when the hate mail was coming in?

2326
02:37:38,353 --> 02:37:40,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, that means you're popular.

2327
02:37:42,003 --> 02:38:08,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, the other thing, too, and now, because keep in mind, I had never actually ever gotten hate mail in my life for anything, so it was kind of a new thing for me, and I know that, like, actual real celebrities go through this, too, but the other thing, too, and this is actually going back in my big history buff, you know, interest, is that typically whenever a woman is outspoken or tries to, you know, run with the boys...

2328
02:38:10,013 --> 02:38:32,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, that's exactly it Or, you know, whenever someone has an issue with a woman It's, you know, not maybe because of her political platform or this It's, oh, well, she's a woman, so she's PMSing Or something like that, you know what I mean You know Well, we originally brought Jamie on the show hoping she'd bring us pie But I'm just kidding Rob, you bitch

2329
02:38:34,321 --> 02:38:35,522
[SPEAKER_09]: See, I'm the bitch on this show.

2330
02:38:36,142 --> 02:38:37,583
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a sassy bitch.

2331
02:38:37,883 --> 02:38:38,524
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

2332
02:38:38,644 --> 02:38:39,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a stupid bitch.

2333
02:38:40,065 --> 02:38:41,806
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're a sassy bitch.

2334
02:38:42,146 --> 02:38:43,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, I'm the bitch.

2335
02:38:43,127 --> 02:38:46,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the one who actually did bring pie on several occasions.

2336
02:38:46,529 --> 02:38:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I have brought pie, too.

2337
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:49,311
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think we've all brought pie at some point.

2338
02:38:49,331 --> 02:38:50,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I've brought pie, and I've brought cookies.

2339
02:38:50,972 --> 02:38:53,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironically enough, Loki's probably the biggest... I have never brought pie.

2340
02:38:53,954 --> 02:38:54,875
[SPEAKER_09]: But you brought bacon.

2341
02:38:55,555 --> 02:38:56,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Super bacon.

2342
02:38:56,236 --> 02:38:57,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I made you lobster kebabs.

2343
02:38:59,858 --> 02:39:04,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I made you lobster kebabs with risotto so you can't say anything there.

2344
02:39:04,502 --> 02:39:07,985
[SPEAKER_09]: There's our eight year anniversary moment looking back thanks to that email.

2345
02:39:08,025 --> 02:39:11,028
[SPEAKER_09]: That was awesome.

2346
02:39:11,328 --> 02:39:12,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2347
02:39:14,451 --> 02:39:15,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get choked up if I say anymore.

2348
02:39:15,872 --> 02:39:18,335
[SPEAKER_09]: You're feeling verklempt.

2349
02:39:18,455 --> 02:39:20,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk amongst yourselves.

2350
02:39:20,216 --> 02:39:21,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to need a nephew.

2351
02:39:21,417 --> 02:39:22,278
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll give you a topic.

2352
02:39:24,355 --> 02:39:33,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to need an FUs of the Week segment to find the anger within me because right now I'm being taken over by big fluffy pink hearts and it's pretty disgusting.

2353
02:39:33,487 --> 02:39:33,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2354
02:39:49,625 --> 02:39:53,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was gonna have a big nasty F you, but I'm all full of joy now.

2355
02:39:54,408 --> 02:39:55,808
[SPEAKER_04]: My heart is singing.

2356
02:39:55,929 --> 02:39:59,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a flutter with, like, unicorn farts.

2357
02:40:01,792 --> 02:40:03,533
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR, powered by unicorn farts.

2358
02:40:05,107 --> 02:40:14,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I do want to say a big F you to the team that's been coming back in my hand, and also to, um, Aquin, who purchased my company.

2359
02:40:14,937 --> 02:40:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna go ahead and friggin' say it.

2360
02:40:16,299 --> 02:40:17,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Aquin sucks.

2361
02:40:17,900 --> 02:40:24,107
[SPEAKER_04]: They outsource all of their, um, customer service, and, um, yeah, they suck.

2362
02:40:25,568 --> 02:40:27,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't care.

2363
02:40:29,272 --> 02:40:32,514
[SPEAKER_04]: and another FU goes to Dust.

2364
02:40:32,714 --> 02:40:34,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots and lots of Dust.

2365
02:40:35,036 --> 02:40:36,677
[SPEAKER_04]: But... Anyone?

2366
02:40:37,097 --> 02:40:37,437
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

2367
02:40:37,878 --> 02:40:38,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Dust.

2368
02:40:38,938 --> 02:40:39,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone?

2369
02:40:39,779 --> 02:40:40,139
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

2370
02:40:40,760 --> 02:40:41,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Dust.

2371
02:40:41,320 --> 02:40:43,762
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will have to give an anti-FU.

2372
02:40:44,242 --> 02:40:44,822
[SPEAKER_04]: An anti-FU.

2373
02:40:44,862 --> 02:40:45,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

2374
02:40:46,043 --> 02:40:52,788
[SPEAKER_04]: To finding... To actually having gone down a size, thanks to my raw foodism...

2375
02:40:53,973 --> 02:40:54,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

2376
02:40:54,293 --> 02:40:55,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday!

2377
02:40:55,074 --> 02:40:55,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

2378
02:41:22,159 --> 02:41:27,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally forgot to get into tonight that when I arrived you weren't wearing pants, but that's a whole other story.

2379
02:41:27,623 --> 02:41:29,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I was wearing shorts.

2380
02:41:29,384 --> 02:41:30,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, it was just funny.

2381
02:41:30,124 --> 02:41:32,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I just walked in here, but they were kind of short shorts.

2382
02:41:32,186 --> 02:41:33,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm like, are you wearing pants?

2383
02:41:34,748 --> 02:41:39,089
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to jury duty and for wasting my time with a civil trial.

2384
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:04,962
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to be pretty.

2385
02:42:07,486 --> 02:42:09,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually don't have a lot of FUs this week myself.

2386
02:42:09,449 --> 02:42:10,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you done, Loki?

2387
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:10,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2388
02:42:10,491 --> 02:42:10,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

2389
02:42:11,331 --> 02:42:13,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have a lot of FUs the week myself.

2390
02:42:13,292 --> 02:42:14,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Things have been pretty good.

2391
02:42:14,173 --> 02:42:15,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, it's been my birthday.

2392
02:42:15,333 --> 02:42:15,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit.

2393
02:42:15,673 --> 02:42:16,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how can I be in a bad mood?

2394
02:42:16,814 --> 02:42:18,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw a lot of awesome people this weekend.

2395
02:42:18,715 --> 02:42:20,216
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a great charity show last night.

2396
02:42:21,157 --> 02:42:23,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot to drink and then got up on stage with a microphone.

2397
02:42:23,598 --> 02:42:24,138
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.

2398
02:42:25,599 --> 02:42:27,500
[SPEAKER_09]: But... What?

2399
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:27,820
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

2400
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:28,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2401
02:42:28,881 --> 02:42:31,843
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTezia says at least it's better than the time she had to hide her bras.

2402
02:42:32,083 --> 02:42:34,464
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, my bras are hanging up in the bathroom.

2403
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:38,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just in the restroom during the break, but I was gonna be nice and not bring that up this week.

2404
02:42:40,217 --> 02:42:40,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

2405
02:42:42,839 --> 02:42:43,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't care.

2406
02:42:43,580 --> 02:42:46,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, remember you guys, you can't put a bra in the dryer.

2407
02:42:46,382 --> 02:42:47,222
[SPEAKER_09]: It warps.

2408
02:42:49,384 --> 02:42:50,385
[SPEAKER_10]: We do all the time.

2409
02:42:50,665 --> 02:42:51,626
[SPEAKER_10]: The more you know.

2410
02:42:54,283 --> 02:43:00,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, word of advice ladies, spend the money on a good bra and get a bra bag, wash it gentle and hang it.

2411
02:43:00,687 --> 02:43:01,188
[SPEAKER_04]: No, trust me.

2412
02:43:01,688 --> 02:43:02,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.

2413
02:43:02,769 --> 02:43:07,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I have saved myself at least 60 bucks a year in buying bras.

2414
02:43:07,892 --> 02:43:14,235
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what you need to do when the current job fades out and you need to become a spokesperson for the bra bag.

2415
02:43:16,138 --> 02:43:17,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, do you know where I get mine?

2416
02:43:17,178 --> 02:43:19,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi guys, DarkSakura here for the bra bag.

2417
02:43:19,739 --> 02:43:22,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I buy my lingerie bags at the dollar store, three for a buck, so don't worry about it.

2418
02:43:23,701 --> 02:43:25,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I should do a frugal cast.

2419
02:43:25,942 --> 02:43:26,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you should.

2420
02:43:27,282 --> 02:43:28,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back with your FUs, I'm sorry.

2421
02:43:28,283 --> 02:43:29,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm sorry, FUs.

2422
02:43:29,983 --> 02:43:33,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, actually I'm in a pretty good mood, but my one FU is that I've been...

2423
02:43:34,125 --> 02:43:55,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I had this weird thing going on a couple weeks ago that was giving me side pain and I thought I was over it but like once in a while my side will still go boop I hate you boop I hate you and it kind of sucks to have that happen on your birthday but I think it's getting better for the most part but just F you to phantom medical issues all right uh oh we can't forget uh intern Junami Junami do you have any FUs

2424
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:56,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

2425
02:44:25,621 --> 02:44:26,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Drunk Chicks.

2426
02:44:26,782 --> 02:44:27,302
[SPEAKER_07]: On the internet.

2427
02:44:27,382 --> 02:44:28,062
[SPEAKER_07]: On the internet.

2428
02:44:28,102 --> 02:44:28,702
[SPEAKER_07]: They exist.

2429
02:44:28,742 --> 02:44:29,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Are bad.

2430
02:44:29,503 --> 02:44:30,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're bad players.

2431
02:44:32,504 --> 02:44:33,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Who to thunk.

2432
02:44:34,465 --> 02:44:45,049
[SPEAKER_09]: These kids today, Loki, like they just... We don't care that you... Like back in my day, Drunk Chicks... Like I'm even gay and I thought that was awesome when Drunk Chicks would come on Xbox.

2433
02:44:45,530 --> 02:44:48,211
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't care that you spent your Saturday nights partying.

2434
02:44:48,451 --> 02:44:49,071
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't care.

2435
02:44:49,191 --> 02:44:52,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in my day, I'd be happy if any chick came on.

2436
02:44:55,592 --> 02:44:57,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, no, I know what you're talking about.

2437
02:44:57,873 --> 02:44:58,553
[SPEAKER_09]: It is annoying.

2438
02:44:59,473 --> 02:45:00,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on.

2439
02:45:01,794 --> 02:45:04,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, we have just a couple more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2440
02:45:05,135 --> 02:45:09,156
[SPEAKER_09]: We might have to put a time limit on Skype calls tonight, just so you know, because I know a lot of people want to call in.

2441
02:45:09,576 --> 02:45:14,817
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we're going to put a three-minute lock on the calls tonight so that we can try and burn through some calls.

2442
02:45:14,938 --> 02:45:20,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to quickly, quickly do calls tonight because I know a few people want to call in because of the anniversary show.

2443
02:45:20,719 --> 02:45:22,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So a three-minute cap on calls tonight.

2444
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:22,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki...

2445
02:45:24,401 --> 02:45:25,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, this is kind of neat.

2446
02:45:26,282 --> 02:45:29,965
[SPEAKER_10]: You Don't Know Jack is coming back.

2447
02:45:31,367 --> 02:45:40,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, this was revealed on the Giant Bomb podcast and confirmed on the official Jellyvision site.

2448
02:45:41,175 --> 02:45:43,878
[SPEAKER_10]: They are partnering up with THQ to bring the series back.

2449
02:45:44,138 --> 02:45:47,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, more details, I guess, are expected later this year.

2450
02:45:48,363 --> 02:45:56,552
[SPEAKER_10]: And they haven't figured out if it's going to be a new game or just a new way to play the old games like on Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network.

2451
02:45:57,253 --> 02:45:58,995
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's coming back.

2452
02:46:00,176 --> 02:46:00,917
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

2453
02:46:01,677 --> 02:46:03,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're all going to get screwed.

2454
02:46:03,558 --> 02:46:06,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you say the name of the podcast that announced that was the Giant Bomb podcast?

2455
02:46:07,119 --> 02:46:07,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2456
02:46:07,519 --> 02:46:11,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we have the theme song, I believe, of the Giant Bomb podcast over here.

2457
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:12,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's tune in here.

2458
02:46:12,461 --> 02:46:24,165
[SPEAKER_17]: If I remember correctly, I believe Giant Bomb is run by Jeff Gerstmann.

2459
02:46:25,565 --> 02:46:26,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you remember him?

2460
02:46:27,506 --> 02:46:28,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Little, uh...

2461
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:32,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Jack the Ride was one that was out and yeah

2462
02:46:59,140 --> 02:47:00,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the short-lived game show.

2463
02:47:02,742 --> 02:47:05,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, the one that was like Pee Wee Herman hosted, right?

2464
02:47:06,884 --> 02:47:09,085
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched a show today.

2465
02:47:09,445 --> 02:47:10,686
[SPEAKER_10]: It's some weird game show.

2466
02:47:10,706 --> 02:47:12,387
[SPEAKER_10]: This is while I was eating chicken wings.

2467
02:47:13,927 --> 02:47:22,632
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a show where apparently it's filmed in LA on a rooftop and they drop things off of a roof while answering trivia questions.

2468
02:47:22,672 --> 02:47:25,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to out myself as a hella nerd here on the show.

2469
02:47:25,853 --> 02:47:27,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the commercial for that and I'm a little retarded.

2470
02:47:27,614 --> 02:47:46,717
[SPEAKER_09]: but I actually subscribe one of my things I read is a game show blog thing that has all the news on game shows like foreign game show clips and stuff and I was reading about that game sounded kind of dumb though it does sound dumb but you know for people like me who think you know those trivia game shows are kind of dumb it is fun watching things fall off a roof

2471
02:47:46,857 --> 02:47:49,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard they pushed Grandma off the roof in one episode.

2472
02:47:49,178 --> 02:47:50,398
[SPEAKER_10]: No, actually, it's kind of cool.

2473
02:47:50,418 --> 02:47:53,059
[SPEAKER_10]: They have people that, you know... Downfall, says Flaming Toilet.

2474
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:53,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Downfall.

2475
02:47:54,120 --> 02:47:56,481
[SPEAKER_10]: They do have people that come with them or whatever.

2476
02:47:56,521 --> 02:47:58,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, in this case, it was a woman and her husband.

2477
02:47:59,142 --> 02:48:05,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And at one point, the husband does get on the conveyor belt because there's a giant conveyor belt that rolls off the roof.

2478
02:48:05,524 --> 02:48:09,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So if she didn't answer the questions in time, he would fall off the roof.

2479
02:48:11,061 --> 02:48:13,163
[SPEAKER_09]: with a safety harness, unfortunately.

2480
02:48:13,183 --> 02:48:15,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet, I want to go on that show and put Jamie on the conveyor belt.

2481
02:48:15,485 --> 02:48:16,126
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be awesome.

2482
02:48:17,607 --> 02:48:18,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let me think of this question.

2483
02:48:18,828 --> 02:48:21,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, I just, I don't know.

2484
02:48:21,911 --> 02:48:22,992
[SPEAKER_09]: What is two plus two?

2485
02:48:23,032 --> 02:48:24,233
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really hard, you guys.

2486
02:48:24,693 --> 02:48:25,494
[SPEAKER_09]: It's math.

2487
02:48:25,834 --> 02:48:27,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jamie just fell.

2488
02:48:27,996 --> 02:48:28,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That sucks.

2489
02:48:28,677 --> 02:48:29,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Five?

2490
02:48:29,698 --> 02:48:29,958
[SPEAKER_09]: No?

2491
02:48:31,079 --> 02:48:32,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, damn it.

2492
02:48:34,762 --> 02:48:36,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Take bets on how many times she bounces.

2493
02:48:36,283 --> 02:48:41,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, this is the worst radio ever, but Jamie is giving me the biggest side eye right now.

2494
02:48:43,645 --> 02:48:47,506
[SPEAKER_04]: That's called the absolute death stare, and it makes Dan piss himself.

2495
02:48:49,867 --> 02:48:52,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Dan, he just texted me and says mini-doc.

2496
02:48:53,869 --> 02:48:55,809
[SPEAKER_04]: He's somewhere where there's a mini-derby owners club.

2497
02:48:55,989 --> 02:48:57,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he's at Dave & Buster's.

2498
02:48:58,562 --> 02:48:59,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow, interesting.

2499
02:49:00,483 --> 02:49:00,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2500
02:49:01,444 --> 02:49:03,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that where you ride miniature horses?

2501
02:49:05,426 --> 02:49:06,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Dwarf ponies.

2502
02:49:06,066 --> 02:49:06,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Mini ponies.

2503
02:49:06,806 --> 02:49:07,427
[SPEAKER_23]: Dwarf ponies.

2504
02:49:09,108 --> 02:49:10,128
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they need to make?

2505
02:49:11,189 --> 02:49:12,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have Sega employees that listen?

2506
02:49:13,250 --> 02:49:13,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Sega!

2507
02:49:14,130 --> 02:49:14,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Sega!

2508
02:49:14,951 --> 02:49:15,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Sega!

2509
02:49:15,811 --> 02:49:16,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen up, okay?

2510
02:49:17,112 --> 02:49:20,976
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this game you made a while back called Derby Owners Club, okay?

2511
02:49:21,536 --> 02:49:22,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's awesome.

2512
02:49:22,918 --> 02:49:25,100
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, more arcades need to embrace it.

2513
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:28,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, to some extent maybe it should have been out on the home consoles.

2514
02:49:28,083 --> 02:49:29,984
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's an arcade title, if nothing else.

2515
02:49:30,865 --> 02:49:38,591
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I really think would be awesome, Sega, is if you made Derby Owners Club again, but this time it's unicorns.

2516
02:49:39,351 --> 02:49:41,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Like... Like for the special breeds?

2517
02:49:41,613 --> 02:49:43,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, just all the breeds.

2518
02:49:43,154 --> 02:49:44,475
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Unicorn Owners Club.

2519
02:49:44,495 --> 02:49:46,757
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it should be a special breed.

2520
02:49:47,657 --> 02:49:49,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I'm just, just, just think about it.

2521
02:49:49,559 --> 02:49:52,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, the special ones, like some could shit rainbows.

2522
02:49:53,121 --> 02:49:56,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them could, you know, like, you know, have sparkle horns.

2523
02:49:56,743 --> 02:49:58,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them could barf love.

2524
02:50:00,526 --> 02:50:01,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And live in harmony.

2525
02:50:01,206 --> 02:50:02,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking fart glitter.

2526
02:50:02,707 --> 02:50:07,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that they should have a derby owners club that's not necessarily limited to horses.

2527
02:50:07,810 --> 02:50:16,176
[SPEAKER_10]: They could have hobos, you know, RC cars, you know, hobos.

2528
02:50:19,196 --> 02:50:26,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Anthropomorphic, you know, plants, I don't know, just ridiculous stuff.

2529
02:50:27,662 --> 02:50:28,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2530
02:50:28,903 --> 02:50:32,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised nobody's tried to make that game, the bumfights the game.

2531
02:50:32,726 --> 02:50:34,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really surprised it's never happened.

2532
02:50:35,167 --> 02:50:36,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I don't want Sega to make that.

2533
02:50:36,388 --> 02:50:41,412
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Sega, Sega, you need to make Unicorn Owners Club, that's all I'm saying.

2534
02:50:42,693 --> 02:50:44,014
[SPEAKER_09]: What are you doing over there?

2535
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:50,664
[SPEAKER_23]: I was trying to find my friend's webcomic by googling Hobo Jesus, and instead I found this picture.

2536
02:50:52,085 --> 02:50:53,225
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm linking this in the chatroom.

2537
02:50:54,506 --> 02:50:59,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Sega, ironically enough, we do have a Sega story, and this is our last story of the night, and it's kind of funny.

2538
02:51:00,790 --> 02:51:05,593
[SPEAKER_09]: They have announced a new feature for Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown.

2539
02:51:05,753 --> 02:51:07,594
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, wow, Virtua Fighter's still around.

2540
02:51:08,455 --> 02:51:11,937
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's coming out in the arcade, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown will be out in the

2541
02:51:12,597 --> 02:51:13,178
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2542
02:51:31,932 --> 02:51:34,094
[SPEAKER_09]: DK Lau has earned the Dragon Wing item from a basic capsule rare.

2543
02:51:55,489 --> 02:51:56,089
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'd like?

2544
02:51:56,329 --> 02:51:59,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like them to add the feature to make people care about that.

2545
02:52:00,131 --> 02:52:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

2546
02:52:01,812 --> 02:52:02,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not that excited.

2547
02:52:04,954 --> 02:52:07,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not that excited about extra Twitter spam, to be honest.

2548
02:52:07,655 --> 02:52:08,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry to say.

2549
02:52:08,675 --> 02:52:10,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

2550
02:52:11,539 --> 02:52:12,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like that trend

2551
02:52:42,998 --> 02:52:47,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and Frisbee in chat actually says, do people hate game updates on Facebook?

2552
02:52:47,362 --> 02:52:48,302
[SPEAKER_09]: How is this any different?

2553
02:52:48,443 --> 02:52:51,625
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, I mean, it's just Twitter spam, honestly.

2554
02:52:51,645 --> 02:52:53,547
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to make their game a trending topic.

2555
02:52:54,067 --> 02:52:57,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Flaming Toilet says, really, linking things to Twitter and Facebook isn't a big deal.

2556
02:52:57,870 --> 02:53:00,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Taking a dump is now linked to Twitter and Facebook.

2557
02:53:00,993 --> 02:53:03,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, wouldn't that be great if your toilet sent tweets?

2558
02:53:03,915 --> 02:53:07,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, been on can for 10 minutes.

2559
02:53:07,078 --> 02:53:08,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Twitter shitter.

2560
02:53:11,129 --> 02:53:11,550
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

2561
02:53:11,570 --> 02:53:13,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, someone liked my status and I'm playing a game.

2562
02:53:13,834 --> 02:53:14,214
[SPEAKER_07]: How is that?

2563
02:53:14,314 --> 02:53:14,795
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2564
02:53:14,855 --> 02:53:15,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still playing a game.

2565
02:53:18,822 --> 02:53:20,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, shall we open up the phones and take some calls?

2566
02:53:21,045 --> 02:53:21,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we shall.

2567
02:53:21,907 --> 02:53:22,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

2568
02:53:23,223 --> 02:53:24,904
[SPEAKER_09]: The phone lines are open.

2569
02:53:43,482 --> 02:53:46,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever you want to do, give us a call and we will talk.

2570
02:53:46,866 --> 02:53:50,009
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us?

2571
02:53:51,430 --> 02:53:52,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind, we have a call coming in.

2572
02:53:52,992 --> 02:53:53,192
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2573
02:53:54,313 --> 02:53:55,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2574
02:53:55,435 --> 02:53:55,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2575
02:53:56,556 --> 02:53:57,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, hey, hey, hey, fellas.

2576
02:53:57,797 --> 02:54:01,001
[SPEAKER_09]: It's DJ Ranma S. Hey, hey, hey.

2577
02:54:01,041 --> 02:54:02,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't forget there's one non-fella here.

2578
02:54:03,803 --> 02:54:04,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, Ook-chan.

2579
02:54:05,953 --> 02:54:07,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi Ranchan!

2580
02:54:07,934 --> 02:54:08,715
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you doing, Ranma?

2581
02:54:09,755 --> 02:54:10,636
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm doing good.

2582
02:54:11,437 --> 02:54:24,925
[SPEAKER_19]: The point of this call is that right before you announced the 8th anniversary show, I sent a text to my entire staff trying to get them all on Twitter so we can shout and congratulate you guys for 8 awesome years.

2583
02:54:25,405 --> 02:54:26,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, well thank you.

2584
02:54:26,446 --> 02:54:26,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it work?

2585
02:54:28,908 --> 02:54:32,830
[SPEAKER_19]: I have with me my awesome Super Producer Sailor Flare with me.

2586
02:54:33,571 --> 02:54:33,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi!

2587
02:54:34,131 --> 02:54:34,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi Super Producer!

2588
02:54:34,791 --> 02:54:34,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello!

2589
02:54:36,613 --> 02:54:37,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, nice to meet all of you.

2590
02:54:37,753 --> 02:54:38,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, nice to meet you.

2591
02:54:39,374 --> 02:54:41,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So you actually work with DJ Ranma S?

2592
02:54:42,594 --> 02:54:43,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

2593
02:54:43,314 --> 02:54:43,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2594
02:54:43,774 --> 02:54:44,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so sorry.

2595
02:54:47,275 --> 02:54:48,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you find him difficult?

2596
02:54:48,936 --> 02:54:52,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Not as sorry as I am.

2597
02:54:52,776 --> 02:54:53,917
[SPEAKER_09]: We think he's awesome.

2598
02:54:53,957 --> 02:54:57,937
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the best New York City guy next to all the other OLR listeners out there.

2599
02:54:58,077 --> 02:54:58,277
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2600
02:54:59,518 --> 02:55:00,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just messing.

2601
02:55:00,158 --> 02:55:01,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you guys for calling in.

2602
02:55:01,918 --> 02:55:03,138
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very cool of you.

2603
02:55:03,158 --> 02:55:05,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are still doing your thing over there at the Anime Jam, right?

2604
02:55:06,448 --> 02:55:07,429
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2605
02:55:21,428 --> 02:55:21,808
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 on an anime show.

2606
02:55:44,051 --> 02:55:44,671
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2607
02:56:06,741 --> 02:56:12,884
[SPEAKER_19]: One of our hosts, DJ Synthetic, she's not just an anime fan, but she's our resident gamer girl.

2608
02:56:12,924 --> 02:56:15,586
[SPEAKER_19]: So she handles all the video games and everything for us.

2609
02:56:16,006 --> 02:56:20,969
[SPEAKER_19]: And believe you me, she fangirled more about E3 than all of us put together.

2610
02:56:21,409 --> 02:56:22,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I will say this.

2611
02:56:22,930 --> 02:56:26,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I did check out when I was at Microsoft's booth.

2612
02:56:26,631 --> 02:56:29,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I did look over and I saw a new Naruto game was being demoed.

2613
02:56:29,833 --> 02:56:31,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And it definitely made me think you anime fans.

2614
02:56:32,918 --> 02:56:43,484
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, when the Naruto games started coming stateside, a lot of people got happy about it, and some kind of complained because the Japanese voices were eliminated, but give and take.

2615
02:56:43,504 --> 02:56:45,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it Fox Boy Ball Z.

2616
02:56:46,687 --> 02:56:48,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, time's about up, Ranma.

2617
02:56:48,347 --> 02:56:49,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta let you guys go.

2618
02:56:49,688 --> 02:56:50,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

2619
02:56:50,748 --> 02:56:51,148
[SPEAKER_04]: One last thing.

2620
02:56:51,208 --> 02:56:51,688
[SPEAKER_04]: One last thing.

2621
02:56:53,109 --> 02:56:56,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranchan, I thought of you earlier today when I was cleaning out the closet.

2622
02:56:57,870 --> 02:56:59,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I found my Tamari fan.

2623
02:57:00,690 --> 02:57:01,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2624
02:57:01,931 --> 02:57:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And I found, actually, I just found the rest of my costume.

2625
02:57:05,231 --> 02:57:06,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

2626
02:57:06,352 --> 02:57:06,972
[SPEAKER_04]: My time jump.

2627
02:57:07,652 --> 02:57:12,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma, we want to hear from your co-host a little more and the chat room is asking, your plug is working.

2628
02:57:12,233 --> 02:57:16,154
[SPEAKER_09]: The chat room wants to know how can they hear to Anime Jam Session?

2629
02:57:18,353 --> 02:57:19,534
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all you, Sailor Flare.

2630
02:57:20,715 --> 02:57:21,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

2631
02:57:22,777 --> 02:57:24,699
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you do this all the time on the show.

2632
02:57:24,719 --> 02:57:27,061
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you should rattle off the list.

2633
02:57:27,121 --> 02:57:28,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I will do the short version.

2634
02:57:29,223 --> 02:57:30,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God, there's a short version?

2635
02:57:31,005 --> 02:57:36,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, just go to AnimeJamSession.com or just follow us on Twitter, Twitter.com slash AnimeJamSession.

2636
02:57:36,963 --> 02:57:39,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, plug successfully given.

2637
02:57:39,225 --> 02:57:39,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, there you go.

2638
02:57:39,885 --> 02:57:44,968
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, you guys have something special we threw to you guys on your main page on OLR.com.

2639
02:57:45,148 --> 02:57:46,649
[SPEAKER_19]: An awesome Beatmania sketch.

2640
02:57:46,930 --> 02:57:48,251
[SPEAKER_19]: You may want to check it out after the show.

2641
02:57:48,531 --> 02:57:49,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that.

2642
02:57:49,511 --> 02:57:54,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had a chance to watch it because I've been tied to my phone all weekend, but I'm going to watch it when I get home.

2643
02:57:54,515 --> 02:57:54,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2644
02:57:55,856 --> 02:57:56,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2645
02:57:56,156 --> 02:57:58,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for calling in and good luck with your show, okay?

2646
02:57:58,417 --> 02:57:58,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2647
02:57:59,678 --> 02:58:00,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2648
02:58:00,859 --> 02:58:03,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I did really crappy with the three minute time limit on that call.

2649
02:58:03,641 --> 02:58:03,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2650
02:58:04,861 --> 02:58:05,221
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's okay.

2651
02:58:05,802 --> 02:58:06,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, technically it was two people.

2652
02:58:07,543 --> 02:58:10,165
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll let it slide.

2653
02:58:10,305 --> 02:58:11,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I should have given him six, but that's okay.

2654
02:58:11,786 --> 02:58:12,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We gave him four.

2655
02:58:12,727 --> 02:58:13,007
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2656
02:58:13,027 --> 02:58:18,271
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to give us a call or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

2657
02:58:19,752 --> 02:58:20,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, got something?

2658
02:58:20,612 --> 02:58:21,213
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll wait for a call.

2659
02:58:21,773 --> 02:58:35,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Zombrek's Dead Rising Sun, the film created by, actually, the creator of Dead Rising, the game, made its directorial debut.

2660
02:58:36,244 --> 02:58:47,012
[SPEAKER_10]: It will actually be coming to North America and Europe this summer and will be released online, possibly as part of the PlayStation Network or Xbox Live.

2661
02:58:48,577 --> 02:58:50,345
[SPEAKER_09]: We got another call on the line, so let me go to it.

2662
02:58:50,385 --> 02:58:51,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2663
02:58:51,530 --> 02:58:51,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2664
02:58:52,625 --> 02:58:53,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2665
02:58:53,625 --> 02:58:54,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hi, X-Link.

2666
02:58:54,506 --> 02:58:55,026
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

2667
02:58:55,166 --> 02:58:55,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

2668
02:58:56,007 --> 02:58:57,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy birthday, bladed princess.

2669
02:58:58,468 --> 02:58:59,808
[SPEAKER_09]: For me or the show or both?

2670
02:59:00,349 --> 02:59:00,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Both.

2671
02:59:00,889 --> 02:59:01,229
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2672
02:59:01,489 --> 02:59:02,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

2673
02:59:02,369 --> 02:59:03,450
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

2674
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:06,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the guild on WoW calls me princess because I make them.

2675
02:59:06,832 --> 02:59:07,072
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2676
02:59:07,092 --> 02:59:10,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we don't want to – No, I did it just to make you happy.

2677
02:59:10,793 --> 02:59:12,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but your princess is in another castle.

2678
02:59:13,415 --> 02:59:14,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much.

2679
02:59:15,075 --> 02:59:17,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I don't want to take too much of the three minutes.

2680
02:59:17,116 --> 02:59:18,477
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to talk about tonight, X-Link?

2681
02:59:18,991 --> 02:59:20,232
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to talk about the real ID.

2682
02:59:21,053 --> 02:59:23,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, please, please.

2683
02:59:23,355 --> 02:59:28,960
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you feel... At least I know I kind of helped make you... I'm pissed because you're not my real ID friend.

2684
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:29,861
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2685
02:59:29,881 --> 02:59:31,662
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually have good news for you.

2686
02:59:32,063 --> 02:59:34,124
[SPEAKER_15]: I know one of your gripes was because you couldn't change your name.

2687
02:59:34,264 --> 02:59:42,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, you could, and actually some of the people from Blizz went on some of the forums to let people know, yes, you can change your name, but you would have to call up

2688
02:59:42,972 --> 02:59:50,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, to the 800 number and talk to one of the representatives and have them change it for you because you can't do it manually through their website.

2689
02:59:50,694 --> 02:59:57,416
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you explain to them why, which I'm sure in good terms says you have a show, they will be more than happy to change it over for you.

2690
02:59:58,076 --> 02:59:59,997
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can't get a change.

2691
03:00:00,017 --> 03:00:01,017
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't sound too bad.

2692
03:00:01,577 --> 03:00:06,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, except for the part of waiting on hold for 30 minutes when I call Blizzard.

2693
03:00:06,061 --> 03:00:07,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that would be the downfall.

2694
03:00:07,522 --> 03:00:18,970
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, too, though, they were telling people and people know, hey, look, you can get changed if you need change or if you got married and it's a different name altogether or you want it, you know, but you can't have it something.

2695
03:00:19,070 --> 03:00:24,614
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think if you want to say, I am an awesome god or, you know, I'm super badass 242.

2696
03:00:26,036 --> 03:00:34,586
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm totally going to call in and tell them I got gay married and I want to change my last name to Roberts and I'll be Rob Roberts.

2697
03:00:34,906 --> 03:00:36,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm totally going to do it.

2698
03:00:43,544 --> 03:00:43,945
[SPEAKER_15]: You can do it.

2699
03:00:44,065 --> 03:00:44,706
[SPEAKER_15]: And explain to them.

2700
03:00:44,766 --> 03:00:46,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Say, hey, look, I have a podcast.

2701
03:00:46,268 --> 03:00:48,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to be my pen name instead.

2702
03:00:48,872 --> 03:00:50,013
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is my pen name.

2703
03:00:50,113 --> 03:00:51,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure they'll allow you.

2704
03:00:51,355 --> 03:00:54,019
[SPEAKER_15]: There shouldn't be a reason to as to why they want it.

2705
03:00:54,119 --> 03:00:56,202
[SPEAKER_09]: That is actually really fast.

2706
03:00:57,043 --> 03:00:57,724
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interesting.

2707
03:00:57,924 --> 03:00:58,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I still...

2708
03:00:59,326 --> 03:01:06,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel strongly that Blizzard is doing the wrong thing overall because this is a huge hurdle that we're having to go over to get the name fixed.

2709
03:01:07,032 --> 03:01:08,954
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's a really interesting development.

2710
03:01:09,314 --> 03:01:10,916
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they took things a little too quickly.

2711
03:01:11,656 --> 03:01:12,917
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my personal issue.

2712
03:01:13,017 --> 03:01:17,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they took things a little too quickly and they didn't get a lot of feedback and they just put it out there.

2713
03:01:17,501 --> 03:01:18,502
[SPEAKER_15]: They're like, here you go.

2714
03:01:18,662 --> 03:01:19,523
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all out here.

2715
03:01:19,983 --> 03:01:20,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Have fun.

2716
03:01:21,124 --> 03:01:25,828
[SPEAKER_15]: and a lot of people, like I said before, I know on our guild forum, I love the story.

2717
03:01:26,748 --> 03:01:30,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody was cyberstalked, believe it or not, kind of, in a way, in a way.

2718
03:01:30,231 --> 03:01:40,439
[SPEAKER_15]: It was kind of like done as a prank from another guild member, but it showed that these, like with your story, this type of stuff can actually happen to other people in real life.

2719
03:01:40,939 --> 03:01:43,081
[SPEAKER_15]: And you don't have to be Britney Spears.

2720
03:01:43,181 --> 03:01:50,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Google, put out Google and figure out where they work, where they live, what their phone number is, possibly what their cell number is.

2721
03:01:51,930 --> 03:01:55,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so it can be a very scary thing if not used properly.

2722
03:01:56,134 --> 03:01:56,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2723
03:01:57,636 --> 03:01:58,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to think about it.

2724
03:01:58,617 --> 03:01:59,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I might try that.

2725
03:02:00,169 --> 03:02:03,050
[SPEAKER_15]: And the friend of the friend thing too, it was really peeved.

2726
03:02:03,130 --> 03:02:04,591
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe that should be on there at all.

2727
03:02:04,731 --> 03:02:07,132
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe the friend of the friend should be looked at.

2728
03:02:07,272 --> 03:02:10,253
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe that should have been ticked off, and that was the only thing that really upset me.

2729
03:02:10,353 --> 03:02:13,914
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, I've been having a lot of fun with it with some of the other guild people.

2730
03:02:14,075 --> 03:02:17,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta wrap up, X-Link, but I do want to say I'm gonna thank you for the tip.

2731
03:02:17,936 --> 03:02:21,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to look into that, but I'm still gonna fight them to make it right.

2732
03:02:21,397 --> 03:02:23,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still gonna put up a good fight to make it right for everybody.

2733
03:02:23,838 --> 03:02:24,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely, just don't leave us.

2734
03:02:25,799 --> 03:02:47,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't, alright Take care, excellent, bye No homo, bye Alright, 877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio If you want to give us a call And talk to us here 877-GAME-OLR, Orange Lounge Radio We got another call coming in already Let's pick it up and see who it is Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Spaznina Hi Spaznina, you sound kind of different tonight Are you on a new phone?

2736

2737
03:03:16,676 --> 03:03:17,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, and then you were...

2738
03:03:19,498 --> 03:03:19,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

2739
03:03:20,058 --> 03:03:22,019
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened again, not even two months later.

2740
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:23,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

2741
03:03:25,961 --> 03:03:27,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a Slim or a regular PS3?

2742
03:03:28,963 --> 03:03:30,223
[SPEAKER_01]: A regular PlayStation 3.

2743
03:03:30,984 --> 03:03:31,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

2744
03:03:31,504 --> 03:03:35,106
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, specifically the 40 gigabyte model.

2745
03:03:36,006 --> 03:03:41,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I can understand that, you know, systems fail occasionally.

2746
03:03:41,769 --> 03:03:45,611
[SPEAKER_01]: But A, I just got the system repaired not even two months ago.

2747
03:03:46,463 --> 03:03:49,606
[SPEAKER_01]: and they sent me a refurbished system.

2748
03:03:50,046 --> 03:03:54,990
[SPEAKER_01]: You would think they would have checked the system over before they sent me a system.

2749
03:03:55,631 --> 03:04:12,424
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, luckily, my one favorite grace is they gave me a three month warranty on the repair so I don't have to shell out the $150 for the repair but it's still a major pain that you know what.

2750
03:04:13,205 --> 03:04:15,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite likely and once I get the system back

2751
03:04:24,417 --> 03:04:27,519
[SPEAKER_09]: They gotta have your picture on the wall over there, Spazinator.

2752
03:04:27,859 --> 03:04:29,260
[SPEAKER_09]: After all this that you've been through.

2753
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:30,740
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what you need to do?

2754
03:04:31,021 --> 03:04:32,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Is you need to go on the second season of The Tester.

2755
03:04:36,335 --> 03:04:37,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I should.

2756
03:04:39,736 --> 03:04:40,376
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my answer.

2757
03:04:41,196 --> 03:04:46,898
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be your pitch is that I need to go on the tester because I have seen everything broken at Sony.

2758
03:04:50,158 --> 03:04:51,439
[SPEAKER_09]: That really should be it.

2759
03:04:52,659 --> 03:04:54,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really.

2760
03:04:55,199 --> 03:05:04,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll try to keep everyone posted as to what's going on with the system either through Twitter or whatever.

2761
03:05:05,042 --> 03:05:05,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do.

2762
03:05:08,123 --> 03:05:17,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys are not going to have a show next week, but hopefully there will be some news out for the following show in two weeks.

2763
03:05:19,273 --> 03:05:20,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Please let us know.

2764
03:05:20,795 --> 03:05:23,177
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, happy 8th anniversary.

2765
03:05:26,465 --> 03:05:27,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you very much, Spazinator.

2766
03:05:27,986 --> 03:05:35,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you haven't listened for the whole eight years, but I know you definitely have had your voice heard on this program over at least about, what, a year and a half, two years?

2767
03:05:36,429 --> 03:05:44,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been calling for about two years, but I haven't been listening since 2006, give or take.

2768
03:05:44,812 --> 03:05:45,653
[SPEAKER_09]: We've enjoyed having you.

2769
03:05:46,033 --> 03:05:53,416
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, Spazinator, we've got to let you go to get some more calls, but good luck with the Sony mess, and I'm telling you, Tester, season two, and give OLR a shout-out when you get on.

2770
03:05:54,887 --> 03:05:55,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

2771
03:05:55,588 --> 03:05:57,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good one.

2772
03:06:14,471 --> 03:06:16,972
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've been an inter- Dude, Drew Nami.

2773
03:06:17,652 --> 03:06:19,693
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this show on PlayStation Network.

2774
03:06:19,833 --> 03:06:22,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit.

2775
03:06:22,895 --> 03:06:24,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I will help you shoot your audition video.

2776
03:06:25,356 --> 03:06:26,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, Drew.

2777
03:06:26,676 --> 03:06:28,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even own a PS3.

2778
03:06:30,078 --> 03:06:30,758
[SPEAKER_09]: All the more reason.

2779
03:06:30,818 --> 03:06:31,538
[SPEAKER_09]: All the more reason.

2780
03:06:31,658 --> 03:06:33,099
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation Network what?

2781
03:06:35,900 --> 03:06:36,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

2782
03:06:36,600 --> 03:06:37,801
[SPEAKER_09]: You get to test stuff.

2783
03:06:37,841 --> 03:06:39,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2784
03:06:39,282 --> 03:06:39,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2785
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:43,862
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, this is Gold Anthro.

2786
03:06:43,922 --> 03:06:47,044
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm doing pretty good.

2787
03:06:47,544 --> 03:06:56,510
[SPEAKER_20]: I've started listening to OLR again because I'm done with my high school and I'm kind of enjoying the summer now since I'm OLR with my friends.

2788
03:06:59,858 --> 03:07:00,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I did.

2789
03:07:00,438 --> 03:07:02,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Me and my friend Robocon in chat.

2790
03:07:02,879 --> 03:07:03,380
[SPEAKER_20]: You say two friends.

2791
03:07:03,440 --> 03:07:04,300
[SPEAKER_20]: I've done a lot of that.

2792
03:07:04,320 --> 03:07:06,201
[SPEAKER_20]: Congratulations on your 8th birthday.

2793
03:07:06,261 --> 03:07:07,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm proud to see it's your birthday.

2794
03:07:25,589 --> 03:07:26,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

2795
03:07:26,369 --> 03:07:28,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you were listening.

2796
03:07:28,370 --> 03:07:37,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I did tell listeners a little bit ago we met up at PAX East and I do remember what you said about that we inspired you to do your own thing and that I can think of no better compliment.

2797
03:07:37,513 --> 03:07:46,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So amongst all the cray-crays that are out there in the world, it's nice that there's cool people, a lot more cool people that are into what we do here at OLR.

2798
03:07:47,596 --> 03:07:48,816
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's nice.

2799
03:07:48,877 --> 03:07:53,458
[SPEAKER_20]: I was glad to hear that you remembered that because I know there's a lot of people you meet up with and

2800
03:07:53,834 --> 03:07:56,637
[SPEAKER_20]: So I really appreciate that when I heard that again today.

2801
03:07:56,897 --> 03:07:58,158
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not as many as you'd think.

2802
03:07:58,278 --> 03:07:59,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not, you know, I'm not Oprah.

2803
03:08:01,642 --> 03:08:02,383
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank God.

2804
03:08:02,523 --> 03:08:06,647
[SPEAKER_20]: I know you guys are with, like, you know, the All Games group.

2805
03:08:06,687 --> 03:08:09,610
[SPEAKER_20]: I know there's a lot of people, a lot of listeners, and so I don't know.

2806
03:08:10,792 --> 03:08:11,513
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems like a lot.

2807
03:08:11,553 --> 03:08:12,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

2808
03:08:12,073 --> 03:08:12,534
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

2809
03:08:13,895 --> 03:08:17,859
[SPEAKER_09]: We have fun here at All Games Radio holding down the Sunday nights with our buddy Bobby.

2810
03:08:17,919 --> 03:08:18,759
[SPEAKER_20]: The more the merrier.

2811
03:08:19,100 --> 03:08:20,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2812
03:08:20,581 --> 03:08:22,363
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of other great All Games shows though too.

2813
03:08:22,423 --> 03:08:30,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear the girls at TQ Crush gave me a birthday shout out but I didn't hear it and I looked at their podcast feed and I didn't see anything there and I don't know.

2814
03:08:30,610 --> 03:08:30,770
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

2815
03:08:31,531 --> 03:08:34,614
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I honestly love all games.

2816
03:08:34,694 --> 03:08:35,515
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty cool.

2817
03:08:35,595 --> 03:08:36,636
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great little network.

2818
03:08:37,316 --> 03:08:40,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, are you going to be out when the baby's born for a little bit?

2819
03:08:41,360 --> 03:08:43,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't remember if we had talked about that or not.

2820
03:08:43,722 --> 03:08:44,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably a couple weeks.

2821
03:08:44,703 --> 03:08:45,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably a couple weeks.

2822
03:08:45,664 --> 03:08:56,895
[SPEAKER_09]: We might, I don't know, we have to talk about a contingency plan, but one idea I have is that we might actually reach out to some of the other all games hosts, or just in general, just podcast, indie podcast hosts, to kind of help out.

2823
03:08:57,783 --> 03:08:59,044
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds cool.

2824
03:08:59,084 --> 03:09:00,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Temporarily promote the intern?

2825
03:09:00,165 --> 03:09:00,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, who?

2826
03:09:00,425 --> 03:09:00,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Your dog?

2827
03:09:00,765 --> 03:09:01,005
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, cat.

2828
03:09:18,949 --> 03:09:20,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, hi, Kitty.

2829
03:09:20,350 --> 03:09:20,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Kitty.

2830
03:09:20,871 --> 03:09:22,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you named him after Macintosh?

2831
03:09:22,512 --> 03:09:22,912
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

2832
03:09:22,932 --> 03:09:23,953
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so cute.

2833
03:09:23,973 --> 03:09:24,933
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cute.

2834
03:09:24,973 --> 03:09:26,775
[SPEAKER_20]: My cat's named after a video game character.

2835
03:09:26,835 --> 03:09:28,276
[SPEAKER_20]: I know you guys are going to get going, though.

2836
03:09:28,416 --> 03:09:29,156
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys are going to get going.

2837
03:09:29,176 --> 03:09:30,137
[SPEAKER_20]: There's other people that want to call in.

2838
03:09:30,197 --> 03:09:33,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there anything else you wanted to say or any quick games you've been playing or shout-outs you want to give?

2839
03:09:35,721 --> 03:09:36,662
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's pretty much it.

2840
03:09:36,782 --> 03:09:41,225
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to let you talk to you guys and check in with you and congratulate you.

2841
03:09:41,265 --> 03:09:44,347
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys have a nice night, and let's enjoy the rest of the podcast.

2842
03:09:44,447 --> 03:09:44,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2843
03:09:45,328 --> 03:09:46,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

2844
03:09:46,148 --> 03:09:46,669
[SPEAKER_09]: You take care.

2845
03:09:48,422 --> 03:09:50,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, SSJ100Matt says, have Travis do it.

2846
03:09:50,663 --> 03:09:51,564
[SPEAKER_09]: No, wait, bad idea.

2847
03:09:51,984 --> 03:09:55,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Travis is still trying to get us to do that whole sitting on the toilet thing.

2848
03:09:55,266 --> 03:10:00,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just like, where do I go with this?

2849
03:10:00,709 --> 03:10:01,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't know.

2850
03:10:01,829 --> 03:10:07,292
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of one of those like, I just don't think I really want to put that on myself on the internet.

2851
03:10:07,312 --> 03:10:11,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think of how to do it funny, you know, but I don't know.

2852
03:10:11,977 --> 03:10:12,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Have Drew do it.

2853
03:10:12,678 --> 03:10:13,840
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll turn it into a train wreck.

2854
03:10:13,960 --> 03:10:14,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the problem.

2855
03:10:15,302 --> 03:10:18,347
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 week is really not the best week to be starting stuff.

2856
03:10:21,106 --> 03:10:25,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they threw down a contest and had the deadline on my birthday.

2857
03:10:25,971 --> 03:10:31,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of one of those... Okay, I'm all for having fun with USL.

2858
03:10:31,977 --> 03:10:34,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect Dark Knight was awesome.

2859
03:10:34,179 --> 03:10:35,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to do that again.

2860
03:10:36,141 --> 03:10:37,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Sitting on the toilet video making?

2861
03:10:38,323 --> 03:10:39,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Less awesome.

2862
03:10:40,345 --> 03:10:42,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to what counts.

2863
03:10:42,187 --> 03:10:42,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Draw the line here.

2864
03:10:43,629 --> 03:10:47,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I know he called me out on YouTube because he loves me.

2865
03:10:47,560 --> 03:10:49,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to more calls.

2866
03:10:49,666 --> 03:10:51,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2867
03:10:51,110 --> 03:10:51,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2868
03:10:52,975 --> 03:10:53,675
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Ziba.

2869
03:10:54,336 --> 03:10:55,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hi, Ziba.

2870
03:10:55,196 --> 03:10:55,776
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

2871
03:10:55,936 --> 03:10:56,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

2872
03:10:56,957 --> 03:10:57,897
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm doing great.

2873
03:10:58,037 --> 03:10:58,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey.

2874
03:10:58,457 --> 03:11:01,878
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you guys were talking about pinball before.

2875
03:11:02,138 --> 03:11:02,379
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

2876
03:11:02,499 --> 03:11:06,320
[SPEAKER_21]: And it totally reminded me of a place I went to recently called the Silver Ball.

2877
03:11:06,760 --> 03:11:07,460
[SPEAKER_08]: The Silver Ball?

2878
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:14,223
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a museum and an arcade, and it's this huge, huge, like, arcade room, like an arcade on, like, a boardwalk.

2879
03:11:15,107 --> 03:11:19,689
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like wall-to-wall pinballs from the 1930s to 1999.

2880
03:11:20,169 --> 03:11:20,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is this?

2881
03:11:20,869 --> 03:11:22,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie needs to be put on a plane immediately.

2882
03:11:23,610 --> 03:11:25,390
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

2883
03:11:26,131 --> 03:11:26,951
[SPEAKER_21]: I have heard of this.

2884
03:11:28,011 --> 03:11:28,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I have heard of this.

2885
03:11:28,891 --> 03:11:32,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that in North Jersey, South Jersey, Middle Jersey?

2886
03:11:33,593 --> 03:11:36,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Middle Jersey, Central Jersey, near the shore.

2887
03:11:36,834 --> 03:11:38,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I've probably driven right by there.

2888
03:11:39,555 --> 03:11:43,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that by Red Bank or where the Jay and Silent Bob store is?

2889
03:11:45,262 --> 03:11:45,662
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe.

2890
03:11:45,843 --> 03:11:46,943
[SPEAKER_21]: It's near the Stone Pony.

2891
03:11:47,504 --> 03:11:47,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2892
03:11:47,884 --> 03:11:48,805
[SPEAKER_21]: You know the Stone Pony?

2893
03:11:48,905 --> 03:11:55,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, keep in mind, I live on the total opposite coast, so I'm not so up on my Jersey geography, but I'm just trying to think if I've been close.

2894
03:11:55,310 --> 03:11:55,930
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, anyway.

2895
03:11:56,271 --> 03:11:57,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally want to go.

2896
03:11:57,432 --> 03:11:59,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to the Pinball Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.

2897
03:11:59,673 --> 03:12:01,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, that would involve going to Jersey.

2898
03:12:02,515 --> 03:12:05,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.

2899
03:12:05,338 --> 03:12:07,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Small sacrifice.

2900
03:12:07,179 --> 03:12:10,582
[SPEAKER_21]: I took my dad there for Father's Day, and he enjoyed it.

2901
03:12:10,742 --> 03:12:12,283
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, my God, you should have saw his face.

2902
03:12:12,443 --> 03:12:13,344
[SPEAKER_21]: He found this once.

2903
03:12:13,789 --> 03:12:15,891
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, you're gonna just have to come in the luggage

2904
03:12:41,826 --> 03:12:45,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start a fund right now, the Send DarkSakura to the East Coast Fund.

2905
03:12:46,311 --> 03:12:49,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to open up my PayPal account so everyone can put in their pennies.

2906
03:12:51,176 --> 03:12:51,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2907
03:12:51,697 --> 03:12:53,198
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys know she's never going to come back.

2908
03:12:54,139 --> 03:12:59,485
[SPEAKER_21]: The thing is, you have to pay an admission fee and all the tumble machines are free.

2909
03:13:00,226 --> 03:13:01,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that sounds like fun.

2910
03:13:01,687 --> 03:13:02,588
[SPEAKER_09]: How much is the admission fee?

2911
03:13:02,608 --> 03:13:03,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it probably like 10 bucks or so?

2912
03:13:05,419 --> 03:13:32,485
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's $7.50 for a half hour and then it goes up from there and here's the website I'll post it into the chat it probably has the cost and everything they are going to appreciate this fat plug you're about to give there silverballmuseum.com thank you Ziba YYR is going crazy I've definitely the daily pass would be perfect for me

2913
03:13:35,084 --> 03:13:42,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I would be in there all day It's crazy Oh my god I was so overwhelmed when I went in there Okay, okay

2914
03:13:54,962 --> 03:13:55,762
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not really.

2915
03:13:55,942 --> 03:13:59,884
[SPEAKER_21]: My dad was a big pinball machine person, so I brought him there.

2916
03:14:00,724 --> 03:14:04,846
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not really a pinball machine person, but it was really, really cool.

2917
03:14:05,006 --> 03:14:10,908
[SPEAKER_09]: If your dad has any of the consoles, check out the Williams Pinball Collection.

2918
03:14:11,048 --> 03:14:12,808
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very worthy, and it's worth looking at.

2919
03:14:12,868 --> 03:14:14,109
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably only $20 right now.

2920
03:14:14,429 --> 03:14:15,069
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

2921
03:14:15,169 --> 03:14:15,969
[SPEAKER_21]: This is fantastic.

2922
03:14:15,989 --> 03:14:18,750
[SPEAKER_21]: My dad's not really tech-savvy, so I don't think he would.

2923
03:14:19,090 --> 03:14:19,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, bummer.

2924
03:14:19,691 --> 03:14:20,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, it was worth a shot.

2925
03:14:21,511 --> 03:14:26,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at what's on the list, by the way, through here, and there are some actually amazing.

2926
03:14:26,673 --> 03:14:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the Galaga Pinball.

2927
03:14:29,394 --> 03:14:29,694
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2928
03:14:30,795 --> 03:14:32,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Ziba, I think you made Jamie's day.

2929
03:14:32,976 --> 03:14:35,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you've given Jamie a new mission in life.

2930
03:14:36,397 --> 03:14:42,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie and Rob Roberts are going to hit the road in a Blues Brothers-style comedy to go to Ashbury Park, New Jersey.

2931
03:14:43,020 --> 03:14:43,280
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2932
03:14:43,940 --> 03:14:46,041
[SPEAKER_21]: And for the record, if you ever go, let me know.

2933
03:14:46,181 --> 03:14:46,501
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll come.

2934
03:14:47,429 --> 03:14:48,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

2935
03:14:48,370 --> 03:14:55,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the record, I'm looking at the later ones, and there's at least four of them on there that are in my house.

2936
03:14:56,674 --> 03:15:00,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Ziba, we've got to let you get more calls, but thank you so much for the tip.

2937
03:15:00,377 --> 03:15:01,117
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate it.

2938
03:15:01,437 --> 03:15:03,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you've got a bunch of listeners interested.

2939
03:15:03,098 --> 03:15:04,759
[SPEAKER_09]: The Silver Ball Museum, I'm sure, thanks you.

2940
03:15:04,839 --> 03:15:07,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, another straight No Chaser fan.

2941
03:15:09,042 --> 03:15:09,322
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2942
03:15:10,733 --> 03:15:13,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziba's currently on my upper list right now.

2943
03:15:14,216 --> 03:15:20,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Ziba has ascended into the... Between pinball and being a straight no chaser fan, totally.

2944
03:15:22,412 --> 03:15:25,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Ziba is kind of like DarkSakura's listener of the week type of thing.

2945
03:15:25,936 --> 03:15:27,017
[SPEAKER_09]: My listener of the week.

2946
03:15:27,077 --> 03:15:27,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Listener of the week.

2947
03:15:27,798 --> 03:15:30,120
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2948
03:15:30,521 --> 03:15:33,724
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have a little plaque and we should have like a listener of the month club.

2949
03:15:34,224 --> 03:15:38,089
[SPEAKER_09]: We should put people in there who have earned the listener of the month.

2950
03:15:38,849 --> 03:15:40,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that where they send us a new listener each month?

2951
03:15:41,212 --> 03:15:41,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2952
03:15:42,113 --> 03:15:44,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we don't like it, we can send it back and get a refund.

2953
03:15:46,465 --> 03:15:47,286
[SPEAKER_04]: What a freeze.

2954
03:15:47,866 --> 03:15:53,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2955
03:15:53,209 --> 03:15:56,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like the phone lines have calmed down a little bit, but we'll see if any others come through.

2956
03:15:56,111 --> 03:15:57,052
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll take about one more call.

2957
03:15:57,412 --> 03:15:59,613
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, Loki, any other news you want to get out there?

2958
03:15:59,833 --> 03:16:00,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, real quick.

2959
03:16:01,374 --> 03:16:05,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo is still continuing to work on the Vitality Sensor.

2960
03:16:06,097 --> 03:16:08,559
[SPEAKER_10]: It's apparently still about relaxing.

2961
03:16:09,599 --> 03:16:13,702
[SPEAKER_10]: No word exactly on when it's going to be coming out, but who cares?! !

2962
03:16:18,466 --> 03:16:33,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Gran Turismo 5, hopefully coming out this November, is going to include a track editor, different weather effects, and go-karts, making it hopefully the last Gran Turismo game they ever release, because really, what more can they possibly add?

2963
03:16:33,993 --> 03:16:40,776
[SPEAKER_10]: And then finally, the Wii menu has been updated to 4.3.

2964
03:16:40,816 --> 03:16:40,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

2965
03:16:44,901 --> 03:16:55,566
[SPEAKER_10]: and apparently this is going to help you out by increasing the performance of the Wii menu system.

2966
03:16:56,407 --> 03:17:00,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and removing all your homebrew stuff automatically because, you know, they don't like that.

2967
03:17:00,909 --> 03:17:02,670
[SPEAKER_09]: They got you this time, Loki, right?

2968
03:17:02,770 --> 03:17:03,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, we got a call.

2969
03:17:03,690 --> 03:17:04,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2970
03:17:04,631 --> 03:17:04,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2971
03:17:06,531 --> 03:17:08,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

2972
03:17:08,913 --> 03:17:09,673
[SPEAKER_09]: You forgot your own name.

2973
03:17:09,713 --> 03:17:10,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

2974
03:17:13,465 --> 03:17:14,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing alright.

2975
03:17:14,346 --> 03:17:15,528
[SPEAKER_09]: What is on your mind, my friend?

2976
03:17:17,089 --> 03:17:18,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much, not much.

2977
03:17:18,451 --> 03:17:21,154
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, happy 8th year anniversary.

2978
03:17:21,374 --> 03:17:22,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2979
03:17:22,916 --> 03:17:23,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you buy.

2980
03:17:23,637 --> 03:17:25,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've been listening for a long time.

2981
03:17:25,419 --> 03:17:29,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to tell you the truth, I started listening to Outside the Box.

2982
03:17:30,734 --> 03:17:31,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

2983
03:17:49,818 --> 03:17:51,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we not doing that again?

2984
03:17:52,179 --> 03:18:00,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, true, we don't have control, per se, over a live network anymore, but there's this awesome technology called podcasting.

2985
03:18:03,601 --> 03:18:05,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, outside the boxes, you know, pretty much it is.

2986
03:18:07,002 --> 03:18:08,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, in some ways.

2987
03:18:08,723 --> 03:18:09,303
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a little bit.

2988
03:18:09,323 --> 03:18:13,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's true, because outside the box is more about the general gaming stuff, and that's kind of what we turned into, so, hey.

2989
03:18:14,444 --> 03:18:14,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2990
03:18:15,324 --> 03:18:17,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know...

2991
03:18:18,308 --> 03:18:19,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times all around.

2992
03:18:19,609 --> 03:18:20,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

2993
03:18:20,589 --> 03:18:21,529
[SPEAKER_09]: What else is on your mind?

2994
03:18:21,549 --> 03:18:24,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you been playing any games lately or stuff you want to give a shout out to?

2995
03:18:24,951 --> 03:18:29,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm still working on Afterburner Climax.

2996
03:18:30,793 --> 03:18:34,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Because me and Huawei are having a battle to the death with that.

2997
03:18:34,594 --> 03:18:38,096
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's another thing.

2998
03:18:38,196 --> 03:18:42,457
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, what I wanted to talk about next week, I'm doing a 4th of July party.

2999
03:18:42,938 --> 03:18:46,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be doing a classic game thing.

3000
03:18:46,858 --> 03:18:47,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome!

3001
03:18:47,618 --> 03:18:49,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to broadcast it or anything?

3002
03:18:50,099 --> 03:18:50,299
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

3003
03:18:50,319 --> 03:18:51,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to broadcast it or anything?

3004
03:18:51,979 --> 03:18:54,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Or no, just your own little par-tay?

3005
03:18:55,360 --> 03:18:56,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little par-tay.

3006
03:18:56,341 --> 03:18:57,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

3007
03:18:58,721 --> 03:19:01,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, what I'm looking for is classic game suggestions.

3008
03:19:01,822 --> 03:19:04,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right now I've got a couple games, including Blades of Steel.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah Dreamcast, Power Stone, fuck yes, Power Stone is the best party game I don't know, Classic, Power Stone was a Capcom game on Dreamcast And it's like, everybody, it's kind of like a fighting game But it's more of like a fast action little thing, that's cool DarkSakura, you're the classic game guru Fun party games from the classic consoles

03:19:57,816 --> 03:19:58,616
[SPEAKER_09]: That's only two players.

3023
03:19:59,537 --> 03:20:00,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get drunk?

3024
03:20:00,658 --> 03:20:02,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get drunk while we're playing it?

3030
03:20:13,788 --> 03:20:20,454
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to think, oh gosh, when you get to four players, you really have to be on the Dreamcast.

3031
03:20:20,554 --> 03:20:23,857
[SPEAKER_04]: The Castle Smashing... Gauntlet Legends.

3032

3040
03:21:01,494 --> 03:21:01,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

3041
03:21:01,954 --> 03:21:02,514
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it work?

3042
03:21:02,534 --> 03:21:05,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, whenever you get shot down, take a shot.

3043
03:21:06,115 --> 03:21:07,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, then you'll be really drunk.

03:21:15,117 --> 03:21:19,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if you want to be festive, Fantavision on PlayStation 2.

3048
03:21:19,598 --> 03:21:23,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how about, though, if you want to get out, break out the sports, go for NBA Jam, dude.

3049
03:21:24,159 --> 03:21:25,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Some comments from our chat room.

3050
03:21:25,599 --> 03:21:26,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat has some awesome suggestions.

[SPEAKER_09]: Gamer Girl with two R's.

3052
03:21:28,960 --> 03:21:32,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Gamer Girl or Gamer Girl says Mario Party.

3053
03:21:32,721 --> 03:21:33,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, the cloud.

3054
03:21:33,681 --> 03:21:34,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Mario Party.

3055
03:21:34,621 --> 03:21:36,321
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're trying to look away from the obvious.

3056
03:21:36,782 --> 03:21:39,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock and Roll Racing by Blizzard says Salacious Pop.

3057
03:21:39,342 --> 03:21:39,822
[SPEAKER_09]: That was fun.

3058
03:21:40,022 --> 03:21:40,562
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good one.

3059
03:21:41,542 --> 03:21:45,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Smash Brothers may be a little obvious too.

3060
03:21:45,343 --> 03:21:47,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a staple to every party that I have.

3061
03:21:47,544 --> 03:21:47,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Twisted Metal.

3062
03:21:48,004 --> 03:21:48,984
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Gears of War, but...

3063
03:21:49,244 --> 03:21:50,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Twisted Metal, that's a good one.

3064
03:21:51,285 --> 03:21:55,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, break out and keep in mind, this was my first LAN experience ever.

3065
03:21:56,607 --> 03:22:00,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Break out a whole crap ton of 486s and play some Duke Nukem.

3066
03:22:00,209 --> 03:22:01,449
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, Atari 2600?

3067
03:22:02,210 --> 03:22:03,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go for Custer's Revenge.

3068
03:22:04,050 --> 03:22:05,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Your party goers will love you.

3069
03:22:05,891 --> 03:22:06,752
[SPEAKER_10]: TimeSplitters 2!

03:22:06,872 --> 03:22:09,973
[SPEAKER_09]: The best first person shooter ever!

3071
03:22:12,434 --> 03:22:16,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, SSJ100 Matt, we've given you about 50 games and you need to go and play them all.

3072
03:22:16,716 --> 03:22:17,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Immediately.

3073
03:22:18,777 --> 03:22:19,277
[SPEAKER_09]: It will do.

3074
03:22:21,359 --> 03:22:24,860
[SPEAKER_09]: All you need is your little shit-talking machine, and you're going to have a blast.

3075
03:22:26,081 --> 03:22:28,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell you, that thing broke, but I'm buying a new one.

3076
03:22:29,123 --> 03:22:30,764
[SPEAKER_09]: As you should.

3077
03:22:30,824 --> 03:22:40,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you, when we have another USL match night, whenever Travis gets over this whole sitting on the toilet thing, you need to attend and bring your little shit-talker, because that thing's amazing.

3078
03:22:41,230 --> 03:22:41,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.

3079
03:22:41,930 --> 03:22:42,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

3080
03:22:43,691 --> 03:22:44,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

3081
03:22:45,672 --> 03:22:46,473
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a fun party.

3082
03:22:47,253 --> 03:22:51,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to point out, I was not invited to this party on that phone call, and I'm a little offended.

3083
03:22:51,919 --> 03:22:52,419
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kidding.

3084
03:22:54,522 --> 03:22:55,943
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only about 4,000 miles away.

3085
03:22:56,384 --> 03:22:56,724
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

3086
03:22:57,145 --> 03:22:57,946
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to wrap up, guys.

3087
03:22:57,966 --> 03:23:01,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to close the Skype line for tonight, but thanks so much for the calls.

3088
03:23:01,289 --> 03:23:02,431
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a fun Skype tonight.

3089
03:23:03,783 --> 03:23:07,627
[SPEAKER_09]: We had some good callers tonight and some old favorites and good times.

3090
03:23:07,968 --> 03:23:08,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy, happy.

3091
03:23:09,009 --> 03:23:10,611
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, other quick stories from Loki.

3092
03:23:10,631 --> 03:23:13,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you have anything else you want to get out there, Loki, before we wrap it all up for you.

3093
03:23:14,135 --> 03:23:18,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Queen, apparently the guitarist is hinting that there's going to be a Guitar Hero Queen game.

3094
03:23:18,600 --> 03:23:19,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Who, Brian May?

3095
03:23:21,062 --> 03:23:21,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

3098
03:23:53,969 --> 03:24:02,820
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt is sending me an invite to the party via Facebook.

3099
03:24:03,101 --> 03:24:05,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do the thing that everybody does and mark myself as a maybe.

3100
03:24:05,984 --> 03:24:06,405
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wrong.

3101
03:24:09,369 --> 03:24:18,817
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I had a flat tire on Saturday, so I totally couldn't do this, but they do this thing to help kittens out.

3102
03:24:19,838 --> 03:24:22,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, you go to PetSmart and help out with the adoption crew.

3103
03:24:23,041 --> 03:24:24,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw something on your Facebook about that.

3104
03:24:24,362 --> 03:24:27,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to do that, but then I had a big flat tire and it took forever.

3105
03:24:27,825 --> 03:24:31,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And the owner of Makuni, we parked in his parking lot.

3106
03:24:32,609 --> 03:24:32,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

3107
03:24:33,630 --> 03:24:38,032
[SPEAKER_04]: and the lug nuts were on too tight and he came out and then started talking to me in really fast Japanese.

3108
03:24:38,753 --> 03:24:43,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, I just said what I could remember and he's like, oh, you know Japanese?

3109
03:24:43,955 --> 03:24:48,918
[SPEAKER_04]: And he asked me and I was like, he's like, oh, that's very good.

3110
03:24:49,358 --> 03:24:52,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he goes and kicks the lug nuts off of my car with the wrench.

3111
03:24:54,121 --> 03:24:56,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they were on really tight so he puts them there and goes...

3112
03:24:57,722 --> 03:24:58,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that.

3113
03:24:58,162 --> 03:24:59,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, this little guy.

3114
03:25:00,984 --> 03:25:05,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Makuni, by the way, just to give some background, is kind of the hipster sushi chain here in Sacramento.

3115
03:25:05,505 --> 03:25:11,768
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will say, they have this garlic edamame that is so good.

3116
03:25:12,488 --> 03:25:13,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, y'all, really?

3117
03:25:13,429 --> 03:25:15,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm crying now, thanks.

3118
03:25:15,289 --> 03:25:15,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, me too.

3119
03:25:15,970 --> 03:25:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: But I totally gave him my card.

03:25:17,851 --> 03:25:18,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

3121
03:25:19,211 --> 03:25:23,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally forgot when I was going with the guy, Makuni.

3122
03:25:24,373 --> 03:25:24,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah, who cares?

3123
03:25:25,254 --> 03:25:25,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

3124
03:25:28,999 --> 03:25:29,319
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

03:25:30,500 --> 03:25:30,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

3126
03:25:30,920 --> 03:25:35,662
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to wrap it all up, guys, and get to the end of the show and all that.

3127
03:25:35,702 --> 03:25:38,963
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you guys so much for downloading our show and listening to us tonight.

3128
03:25:39,063 --> 03:25:42,784
[SPEAKER_09]: For eight years, we don't really do commercials during the show.

3129
03:25:42,824 --> 03:25:44,265
[SPEAKER_09]: We do shout-outs for other indie stuff.

3130
03:25:44,865 --> 03:25:46,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We are an indie podcast.

3131
03:25:46,406 --> 03:25:47,586
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no magazine.

3132
03:25:47,806 --> 03:25:49,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Our website really isn't the focus.

3133
03:25:49,547 --> 03:25:54,049
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't do breaking news like the one-ups or the game spots of the world and all that.

3134
03:25:54,909 --> 03:25:58,171
[SPEAKER_09]: or the giant drop the bombs and all that stuff.

3135
03:25:58,211 --> 03:26:03,975
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't really get any money from doing that so we don't get advertising and we can't have big boosts at E3.

3136
03:26:04,415 --> 03:26:07,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So really the only way we spread the word about our show is word of mouth.

3137
03:26:07,257 --> 03:26:10,999
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you like what you hear, just tell a friend or two like Golanthro did earlier.

3138
03:26:11,039 --> 03:26:14,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word about OLR.

3139
03:26:14,641 --> 03:26:15,462
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we really ask.

3140
03:26:15,942 --> 03:26:31,543
[SPEAKER_09]: and if you're like seriously Rob none of my friends are into the podcast thing none of them will get it go leave a nice review on iTunes we really appreciate the five star reviews a couple more showed up this past week I think I saw one from Flaming Toilet who was here earlier I saw one from Internet Celebrity

3141
03:26:32,803 --> 03:26:33,343
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

3142
03:26:59,948 --> 03:27:01,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss Lesat Scourge Lounge.

3143
03:27:03,410 --> 03:27:04,390
[SPEAKER_09]: We could do that in the afterbirth.

3144
03:27:04,570 --> 03:27:05,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do that.

3145
03:27:05,951 --> 03:27:07,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, maybe not tonight because we're running a little long.

3146
03:27:07,592 --> 03:27:08,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that next week.

3147
03:27:08,132 --> 03:27:09,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, two weeks.

3148
03:27:09,493 --> 03:27:10,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to wrap up.

3149
03:27:10,953 --> 03:27:11,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Final thoughts.

3150
03:27:11,454 --> 03:27:12,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go around to final thoughts.

3151
03:27:12,894 --> 03:27:14,655
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is...

3152
03:27:20,471 --> 03:27:24,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Zappy says the only indie podcast I know that has a magazine is Electric Sisterhood.

3153
03:27:24,476 --> 03:27:25,518
[SPEAKER_09]: They're different though.

3154
03:27:25,598 --> 03:27:27,000
[SPEAKER_09]: They're still indie.

3155
03:27:27,360 --> 03:27:30,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Ninja Sister and I always seem to run into each other at cons except E3.

3156
03:27:30,384 --> 03:27:31,285
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a magazine.

3157
03:27:31,946 --> 03:27:33,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they started their own little magazine.

3158
03:27:33,627 --> 03:27:34,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's awesome.

3159
03:27:34,607 --> 03:27:35,167
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

3160
03:27:35,227 --> 03:27:36,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're kind of artists, too.

3161
03:27:36,788 --> 03:27:37,988
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still an independent magazine.

3162
03:27:38,008 --> 03:27:38,849
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still independent.

3163
03:27:38,869 --> 03:27:39,229
[SPEAKER_09]: They count.

3164
03:27:39,269 --> 03:27:39,809
[SPEAKER_04]: They count.

3165
03:27:39,869 --> 03:27:46,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually wanted to do something like that for us since I'm big in publishing, you know, because that's actually what I want to do with my life.

3166
03:27:46,091 --> 03:27:46,892
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.

3167
03:27:46,912 --> 03:27:47,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.

3168
03:27:47,672 --> 03:27:49,613
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no reason we can't have a little zine.

3169
03:27:49,653 --> 03:27:52,474
[SPEAKER_23]: There's still sideways profile pictures of you guys.

3170
03:27:52,935 --> 03:27:54,176
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a little camera right now?

3171
03:27:55,957 --> 03:27:58,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do our final thoughts before we have a business meeting.

3172
03:27:58,619 --> 03:27:59,960
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what our business meetings are like.

3173
03:28:00,440 --> 03:28:01,120
[SPEAKER_09]: No you!

3174
03:28:01,501 --> 03:28:02,181
[SPEAKER_09]: No you!

3175
03:28:02,501 --> 03:28:03,122
[SPEAKER_09]: No way!

3176
03:28:03,382 --> 03:28:03,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Way!

3177
03:28:03,842 --> 03:28:06,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get one of the listeners to do it?

3178
03:28:09,326 --> 03:28:09,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

3179
03:28:11,628 --> 03:28:12,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's wrap up.

3180
03:28:12,810 --> 03:28:13,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Final thoughts, everybody.

3181
03:28:13,931 --> 03:28:16,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Drew Nami, thank you for being here to celebrate this landmark occasion with us.

3182
03:28:17,336 --> 03:28:18,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be a stranger.

3183
03:28:18,738 --> 03:28:19,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll keep coming back.

3184
03:28:19,880 --> 03:28:20,601
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, good for you.

3185
03:28:20,621 --> 03:28:21,982
[SPEAKER_04]: But he keeps getting stranger and stranger.

3186
03:28:22,063 --> 03:28:22,383
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

3187
03:28:22,944 --> 03:28:23,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a final thought for us?

3188
03:28:24,045 --> 03:28:25,447
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, how old did you turn this week? 25.

3189
03:28:26,989 --> 03:28:27,670
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still a baby.

3190
03:28:27,730 --> 03:28:30,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I was 17 when you guys started broadcasting.

3191
03:28:30,071 --> 03:28:32,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I'm so old.

3192
03:28:32,073 --> 03:28:33,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Our little Republican.

3193
03:28:34,495 --> 03:28:35,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Our little Republican.

3194
03:28:36,436 --> 03:28:39,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used to get into it on the politics.

3195
03:28:39,619 --> 03:28:40,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Libertarian.

3196
03:28:41,180 --> 03:28:42,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

3197
03:28:43,181 --> 03:28:45,403
[SPEAKER_07]: At least he's starting to come around.

3198
03:28:45,563 --> 03:28:48,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up with you guys and look how I turned out.

3199
03:28:49,162 --> 03:28:50,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Send him to a state school.

3200
03:28:50,443 --> 03:28:51,023
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll get turned around.

3201
03:28:51,043 --> 03:28:53,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is funny because I don't identify as libertarian anymore.

3202
03:28:53,946 --> 03:28:54,866
[SPEAKER_07]: We're eight years in.

3203
03:28:54,926 --> 03:28:57,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep listening or Axe Cop will chop up your head.

3204
03:28:57,268 --> 03:28:59,089
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to really try to get to ten.

3205
03:28:59,730 --> 03:29:01,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I know everybody's got their lives and all that stuff.

3206
03:29:02,292 --> 03:29:04,293
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we've really got to try to get to ten.

3207
03:29:04,573 --> 03:29:05,134
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do it.

3208
03:29:05,434 --> 03:29:05,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we can.

3209
03:29:06,274 --> 03:29:06,515
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

3210
03:29:08,316 --> 03:29:09,777
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much, Drunami, for being here.

3211
03:29:10,017 --> 03:29:11,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And your final thought was?

3212
03:29:11,618 --> 03:29:12,819
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my final thought.

3213
03:29:12,859 --> 03:29:13,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep listening.

3214
03:29:13,740 --> 03:29:15,541
[SPEAKER_09]: We're eight years in, but we're still going.

3215
03:29:15,801 --> 03:29:16,122
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

3216
03:29:16,402 --> 03:29:17,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Still going like a bad STD.

3217
03:29:18,323 --> 03:29:20,663
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, since I'm looking at you, what's your final thought?

3218
03:29:20,683 --> 03:29:23,224
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually should promote him from intern to mailroom.

3219
03:29:24,324 --> 03:29:25,464
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he was always going to be the intern.

3220
03:29:25,504 --> 03:29:25,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

3221
03:29:26,044 --> 03:29:27,004
[SPEAKER_09]: No promotions at OLR.

3222
03:29:27,725 --> 03:29:29,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailroom means I actually get paid.

3223
03:29:29,465 --> 03:29:32,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're like Dekeman or VXJasonXV.

3224
03:29:32,465 --> 03:29:35,366
[SPEAKER_09]: They do a lot of work for the web stuff, so they get promotions.

3225
03:29:37,146 --> 03:29:39,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Drew's an intern.

3226
03:29:39,527 --> 03:29:39,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm chief.

3227
03:29:40,007 --> 03:29:40,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Intern, I want coffee.

3228
03:29:42,307 --> 03:29:42,847
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

3229
03:29:44,687 --> 03:29:46,348
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought for us tonight.

3230
03:29:46,588 --> 03:29:47,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Intern, update the wiki.

3231
03:29:48,496 --> 03:29:49,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Work, work.

3232
03:29:50,058 --> 03:29:55,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And seriously, I want our wiki to be thriving and gorgeous as it once was when it was new and shiny.

3233
03:29:56,384 --> 03:29:57,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Update that bitch!

3234
03:29:57,485 --> 03:30:07,596
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some people that like AJ Mix and Dark Tetsuya I see on there all the time, so they do get a sportsman-like pat on the bottom for that.

3235
03:30:07,956 --> 03:30:10,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, like, some of our staple pages... That's no Pat.

3236
03:30:11,460 --> 03:30:19,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of our staple pages are updated, and guys, I thank you so much for that, but we do, you know, and, you know, we all work right now.

3237
03:30:20,809 --> 03:30:24,233
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to see some of our newer stuff updated on the wiki.

3238
03:30:24,293 --> 03:30:25,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it would be nice.

3239
03:30:25,715 --> 03:30:25,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

3240
03:30:25,955 --> 03:30:26,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

3241
03:30:26,821 --> 03:30:29,422
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says, intern, break the soundboard table.

3242
03:30:29,922 --> 03:30:30,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't!

3243
03:30:31,443 --> 03:30:32,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's now a soundboard chair.

3244
03:30:32,803 --> 03:30:33,963
[SPEAKER_09]: We've made it intern proof.

3245
03:30:34,244 --> 03:30:35,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even tip it over!

3246
03:30:35,824 --> 03:30:39,425
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using a very solid step stool.

3247
03:30:39,485 --> 03:30:41,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like... It's Drew proof.

3248
03:30:41,546 --> 03:30:46,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Cananogram's forcing a standoff, saying, we'll update the wiki if you give us shirts.

3249
03:30:48,174 --> 03:30:50,055
[SPEAKER_09]: We're so indie that the shirts don't fit.

3250
03:30:50,235 --> 03:30:52,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when Intern made his own damn shirt.

3251
03:30:52,536 --> 03:30:53,396
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty hardcore.

3252
03:30:53,416 --> 03:30:55,797
[SPEAKER_07]: The Intern almost wore his damn shirt.

3253
03:30:55,937 --> 03:30:56,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost dug it up.

3254
03:30:56,977 --> 03:30:57,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

3255
03:30:57,778 --> 03:30:58,338
[SPEAKER_07]: That's impressive.

3256
03:30:58,418 --> 03:30:58,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost.

3257
03:31:00,119 --> 03:31:06,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all of the t-shirts that I have right now, though, all my gaming t-shirts have actually been worn and washed, so I don't know if you want to wear my leftovers.

3258
03:31:06,661 --> 03:31:09,922
[SPEAKER_07]: We will... I'm waiting on my... I'll send you... Try what we can do.

3259
03:31:09,942 --> 03:31:12,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I will send you a Metal Gear Solid pillowcase.

3260
03:31:12,644 --> 03:31:14,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting on my number 23 Oil Army shirt.

3261
03:31:14,084 --> 03:31:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki...

3262
03:31:17,045 --> 03:31:18,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

3263
03:31:19,026 --> 03:31:19,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm tired.

3264
03:31:20,647 --> 03:31:21,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Me too.

3265
03:31:21,287 --> 03:31:24,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I was up until 1 in the morning last night.

3266
03:31:24,668 --> 03:31:25,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Doing the show roll, by the way.

3267
03:31:26,469 --> 03:31:32,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, 1.30 I was up in the morning because I was working on the baby room mural.

3268
03:31:32,712 --> 03:31:35,593
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm on the third wall for that.

3269
03:31:35,793 --> 03:31:36,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby.

3270
03:31:36,773 --> 03:31:37,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I have to get it done.

3271
03:31:38,674 --> 03:31:39,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the baby's going to be here soon.

3272
03:31:40,675 --> 03:31:47,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, and because I need to... I need to get it all done so I can work on my Grand Theft Auto edits.

3273
03:31:48,284 --> 03:31:49,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, my final...

3274
03:31:50,106 --> 03:31:50,847
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought, wait.
