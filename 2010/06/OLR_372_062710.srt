00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Tonight June 27th, 2010, Xbox Live might stop Final Fantasy 14 from showing up on 360

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
A classic PC game show is set to come back, and are people leaving their Facebook games?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You know what, it is that show, as we say, where every gamer has a voice

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And joining me over the next three hours, say hello, oh my name is Rob Roberts in case you didn't know

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Joining me over the next few hours, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How are you?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Happy birthday

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yay

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Happy birthday

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're old

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yay

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Happy birthday

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's not my birthday

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well it's the show's birthday

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Orange Lounge Radio turned eight years old this week on June 23rd, was our first show

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So there you go

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's why I'm saying happy birthday to everybody

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now I did have an actual birthday yesterday, but we don't talk about that because I really am old

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm four times the age of the show

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Who's older than you in this room?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Um

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Me

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So shut up

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and introduce tonight a special guest we have here in studio

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A very special, I almost said spatial guest because he takes up space, as he usually does here on this show

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We always give him a hard time

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He takes up less space than each of us

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Actually yes, he's actually a skinny motherfucker, I hate him for it, but that's okay

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Say hello, he has not been here in probably what, like four years or something?

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's been a long time

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
About a year

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
About a year, I don't know

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Last time you were here we were at the other studio

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
By the way, say hello

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No further ado, the 23rd Magus, also known as Drewnami

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you have a new name now?

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Drewnami

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Drewnami still, okay

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Because I know back in the day you were 23rd Magus for about the first three years of the show

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then you were Drewnami for about another, you know, I guess till now

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not due for another handle change anytime soon

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, just checking

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So how are you?

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, I heard you guys kind of missed me, so here I am

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And now you're in targeting range

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Our aim consistently improves

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Actually, it's kind of funny because you have something in common with Orange Lounge Radio, don't you?

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, I share a birthday with you guys

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So happy birthday to you as well

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And has a toilet paper joke book

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, there's all these little in-jokes that go with Drewnami

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Because you used to come to the show a lot back in the heyday

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You know, we all play DDR and all those, you know, arrow stomping and arm waving

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And button mashing and all those fun music games we used to play back in the day

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But I gotta say, I don't know if you heard, but there's like more than 12 people listening to Orange Lounge Radio now

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's really

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No!

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know, right?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Like, who would have thought, right?

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, catch up some of the people who've never heard you on this program before

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What kind of games do you play?

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you into and why are you here on this show?

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, I'm still kind of the big Bimani buff

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Although that's kind of waned a bit in the past couple of years since, you know, the genre's kind of waned

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm the RPG, the MMO buff

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If it's Square, if it's BioWare, I've probably played it

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I just play a very diverse set of games

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You must be looking very much forward to that new Star Wars game that's by BioWare

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like, it's an MMO

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The Old Republic?

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The new one, what's the new one? Oh, I can't even remember

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Star Wars The Old Republic

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is it? Okay

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A lot of people say it's gonna be a WoW killer

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Me, as the kind of WoW addict, I say no

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why does there have to be a WoW killer?

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I mean, yes, I realize 11 million people are subscribed to WoW

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But, you know, there's a lot more people on the planet, you know what I mean?

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like, I don't think WoW is gonna die by the hands of one game

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It may die by the hands of itself one day?

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, I'll get into that later because I'm really, really mad at WoW this week

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Really mad

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The Roman Empire was responsible for its own destruction

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And who hears about EverQuest anymore?

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's gonna come a day where WoW is gonna have to go through a major overhaul

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
To kind of catch up, or, you know, to stay current

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And, you know, sometimes these overhauls are not received very well

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But I don't know, I mean, I don't want to get too far off topic

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because it's too much crystal ball and, you know

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, a lot of people just don't juggle multiple MMOs

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And I think the market's sort of reaching saturation if you ask me

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangelaundraidio.com

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And look at some comments as you folks chat live with us

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
www.allgames.com

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, he's on at about 5 Pacific

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're on at about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But, you know, sometimes we run late, you know, it's just a deal

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Alright, but we're here taping live, so please, if you're listening live to us on All Games

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Join our chat room at chat.orangelaundraidio.com

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, Ziba in our chat room says

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Every new MMO is said to be the WoW killer

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Remember when Warhammer Online was gonna be the WoW killer?

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Remember when Ion was gonna be the WoW killer?

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Remember when Eve was supposed to be the WoW killer?

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, Eve still has a pretty strong cult following

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, but it's still very niche

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Star Trek Online

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was gonna say, here we have Jamie and her thing is Star Trek Online

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And it was Ragnarok

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I think Star Trek Online is a good example

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Does it have as many people as WoW? No

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But is it probably doing successful for itself? Sure

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's probably making money, you know, it's so

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Probably, I doubt Star Trek Online took all these people away from WoW

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think it kind of carved itself to a new audience that maybe wasn't playing WoW before

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Like Jamie, Jamie quit WoW before STO was out

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, it just seems to me that WoW is sort of like

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Remember when we discussed Guitar Hero versus say Beatmania?

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How it was, it brought accessibility to the genre, brought it into the mainstream

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh yeah

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
A lot of MMOs are kind of following the WoW formula, so to speak, or incorporating

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And vice versa

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There were so many people when Guitar Hero first came out, especially the group listening to this show

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That grew up on the Bomani Games that were like

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Freaking ripoff of Guitar Freaks

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is just a stupid ripoff

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And Guitar Freaks is better

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And the music's better

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And Guitar Freaks, well, okay

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And then when Beatmania US finally came out

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Reviews called it a ripoff of Guitar Hero

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well that was ignorant

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I mean, that was just straight up written by an intern

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ignorant intern that should never

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Ignant

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Ignant intern that should never

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's an insult to interns everywhere

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm digress, sorry

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sorry Do Not Me, but you know

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But I digress

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The thing is that Guitar Hero, you hit the nail on the head

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Succeeded where Guitar Freaks failed because

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Harmonix, who was the developer at the time, took a risk

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A huge risk and made it accessible

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Konami, too stubborn to take risks

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And I still say that's the case with them to an extent today

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Too stubborn to take risks

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Anyhow

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wow, fun show already

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We haven't gotten into the news

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's start off with How Was Your Gaming Week?

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We always like to talk about the games we've been playing

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ladies first, Dark Soccer, How Was Your Gaming Week?

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, it was

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know, it actually wasn't too bad

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Because I have a DSI now

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I will not say how we acquired such a thing

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Huzzah!

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You stole it

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Killed a hobo

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Killed a hobo, exactly

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So, I've actually started back into The World Is Not Enough

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a cool game

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Awesome game

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh yeah, I've heard a lot of neat things about that

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I haven't spent a lot of time with that myself

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Wait, The World Is Not Enough, that was a Bond movie

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The World Ends With You

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The World Ends With You

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Because, well, I'll tell you what my brain did

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, here's an insight into how my brain works

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I said The World Is Not Enough, then my brain went

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's not right, because that spells out twine

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What game?

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What?

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I just think of the garbage song

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's how my mind works

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think of the song from the James Bond movie

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The World Is Not Enough, T-W-I-N-E

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, I get it, T-wine

193
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I was like, I was like twine

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Like the biggest ball of twine in, no that wasn't it

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's how my brain, that's the cycle that my brain went through

196
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
T-Pain's younger sister, T-wine

197
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And then that's when I realized I was playing Sam and Max

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And that's when I realized

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The World Ends With You

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And that's when I realized Joshua is still an asshole

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I started actually trying to play Oh And On again

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Which spells out T-weh

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, also we've been watching the Mario marathon

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because that's super awesome

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I've also been sending Dan YouTube videos of this guy

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Playing a bunch of brass instruments

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You know, re-recording himself

208
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Doing like the Mario 64 theme

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And playing the euphonium

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Which is one of my favorite instruments

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I just like to say it, euphonium

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's really about, oh yeah yeah yeah

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I played some Portal

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I lusted over Portal 2 some more

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And um, oh yeah lots

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I love your description

217
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I lusted over Portal 2

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I played a crap

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You sound like you're watching YouTube

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And your tongue is on the floor

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's not what you do when you lust Rob

222
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So pretty

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Anyway, and I played a crap ton of Star Trek Online

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I played enough Star Trek Online in two days

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
To get from Commander 2 to Commander 7

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So, because you have ten ranks in each rank

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So I'm three ranks away from Captain

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Mini ranks

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, I said you have degrees of your rank

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I am now at Commander level 7

231
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I will be probably Captain before my surgery

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
My goal is to get to Captain before I go out for surgery

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's talk about your surgery for a minute

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Because it's going to impact the show coming up

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh shit, that's right

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well we don't have to, you know

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No we can tell, it was fine

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well you're going to be having surgery, what?

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
On the hand again, right?

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, I will be a little technical here

241
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have trigger finger

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's also called flexor tendinitis

243
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have it in my middle two fingers on my right hand

244
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And if you want to really know what the surgery goes into

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Just look it up online

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll post something in the chatroom and gross everybody out

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I was awake during my last one

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And I don't really care about my new one

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because I'll be awake through that too

250
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm just glad I get my benefits

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No, insurance, seriously

252
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Healthcare is the big hot issue here

253
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And thankfully I'll be on FMLA during the layoffs at my company

254
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So I will still have employment at my old company

255
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And still have benefits

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And then I get laid off

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Work that system, work it

258
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And then I get laid off

259
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Aww, wah wah wah

260
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hire me, I'm a designer

261
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So the whole thing about this though

262
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is that basically they're going to fly my hand at the palm

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And cut the tendon sheaths around the middle two fingers

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then leave it open

265
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because what's going to happen is there's a big knot in there

266
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And it's going to grow over the knotting

267
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that the swelling will go down

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And as a result I won't be able to use my right hand for at least a week

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And it'll be replaced by a monkey paw

270
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No

271
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Although actually a chimpanzee would be cool

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
She really will be Jamie Summers

273
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Because they're going to give her a bionic arm

274
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I want a bionic hand

275
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Will you be able to go go go gadget finger?

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Is his middle finger the water pistol one?

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Damn it Rob, you stole my joke

279
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But no, so I'm going to go in and have my hand flayed open

280
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
By a specialist

281
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Ooh

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I will

283
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
They have specialists that flay hands?

284
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes they do

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I want to be that specialist

286
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So I will be here for the show

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I just will be very slow with

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You know, probably will not be hanging out in the chat room

289
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Or I might be in the chat room just, you know, ghosting

290
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Slamming down random keys

291
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And the best thing about it is Vicodin

292
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It'll sound like a Zaku call

293
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
When he doesn't stop typing on the keyboard

294
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Thump thump thump thump thump thump thump

295
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No

296
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Jamie's slamming her monkey paw down on the keyboard

297
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
She's communicating

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
One thump means she's angry

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What I want is chimp fingers

300
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Or like orangutan fingers, the really long ones

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That I can grab things and poke holes in fruit

302
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So

303
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But the best part is drugs

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's always the best part of a surgery

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I will be on, probably on Vicodin

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They don't really care if you hurt or not

307
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They just want you to not care that you hurt

308
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Be sure to play tons of video games while you're on drugs

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay get this

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Last time I had my surgery, do you know what I was doing two days later?

311
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Playing Blue Dragon

312
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All night

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Did you think the game was good?

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I love Blue Dragon

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's like playing a Dreamcast game

316
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hey

317
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I liked it because it was like playing a Dreamcast game

318
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay

319
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
By the way, I also cleaned out a closet today

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
In this preparation for not being able to do any housework

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I found my Dreamcast shirt

322
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And a crap ton of stuff that I'm sending to our buddy Rob in England

323
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well isn't that nice of you

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes

325
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Alright so no show July 4th

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He sends me dirty cards every year

327
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No show July 4th because that is the day that America celebrates fire

328
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So we're

329
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I mean that's a very important holiday to us

330
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you're having a block party for my neighborhood on the 3rd

331
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So you totally have to come

332
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh we just might actually

333
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So we got that going on

334
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But then come July 11th

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Orange Lounge Radio will be back

336
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You said it

337
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And it'll be something like this when Orange Lounge Radio is back on the 11th

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Orange Lounge Radio starring

339
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Rob Roberts

340
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And featuring

341
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No no no no

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
See Rob

343
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You have to do the right thing

344
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You have to play the bionic level

345
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And you know that's

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Seriously what I got my name after

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
No I know

348
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You know

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I want to

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Be all bionic and have the little

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
String quartet follow me around every time I run

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Cause you know

353
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
They always play that string music whenever

354
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She starts running

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Cause the bionic man gets the

356

sound you know

357
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I want the string quartet to follow me

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Since it'll be my hand they have to play when I type

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Alright

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Spyro's in our chat room saying

361
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Even though I'm British I still celebrate the 4th

362
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Stick it to the king

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No that's kind of like feeding

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
a cow a hamburger but okay

365
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Double the beef why

367
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You know that's what caused mad cow disease

368
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I bet alright look

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000

We talk about video games. Loki how was your

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Gaming week?

372
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It was okay I actually played some different

373
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Stuff this week because I am being

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Forced to

375
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Sit on a jury

376
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh crap did you get picked?

377
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I got picked

378
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Jokes on them

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Actually

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Alright we're going to ask you all about

381
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The case when it's done it's still going right?

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah

383
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay so I know you can't talk about it cause but

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well I can't but

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Actually

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You want to get dismissed real quick here's your

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Form

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's not dismissed that's contempt

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When they're doing the interview she'll go

390
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I support killing them

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But it wouldn't be

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's okay cause Inspector Gadget can get you out of jail

393
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It wouldn't be so bad if it was like

394
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You know a criminal

395
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Trial but no it's a civil

396
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Trial you know in other words somebody

397
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Is mad and so they're suing for

398
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Money and that's

399
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's going it

400
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I kid you not I couldn't roll

401
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
My eyes more than at this

402
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Trial and on top of that

403
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The prosecution lawyer is an idiot

404
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Who talks like Andy Griffith

405
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And it's hilarious

406
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So is the case anything like this

407
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
When you're in the courtroom like you know

408
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You'll just kind of be sitting there and then you know

409
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Now the

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Prosecution is going to call a witness to the stand

411
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No it's not even that dramatic

412
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's like

413
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay I kid you not we're not supposed to talk about

414
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The case but we're going to talk about like this

415
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Cause it doesn't really

416
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No no no no listen it doesn't really talk

417
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
About the case at all they spent

418
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
An hour and a half discussing the

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Difference between a phone

420
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
A speaker phone

421
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And a loudspeaker

422
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
PA system because they were

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Confused or I should say

424
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The prosecution lawyer was

425
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Confused and we were

426
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Falling asleep we went

427
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Then we finally had our afternoon break we all

428
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Walked out into the you know

429
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hallway and just kind of looked at each other and

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Shook our heads like this is going to last

431
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Until November

432
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Great you got the lawyer who watched

433
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Too much Matlock

434
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh my god the guy is like it's

435
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Seriously Andy Griffith

436
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He introduced

437
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He introduced himself as

438
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay I'm going to screw up people's

439
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Names I'm going to forget things

440
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm going to repeat stuff I'm going

441
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
To um get

442
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Confused but don't hold that against

443
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
My client I'm like how much

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Did you pay for this guy

445
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Hey at least he's modest Tigerclaw wants

446
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
To know court appointed Tigerclaw in our chat

447
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Room wants to know if the case is a little more like

448
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Night court

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'd say it's more

450
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Night court than law and order

451
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh god look out for bull

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000

453
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So we got inspector gadget we got

454
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Night court I don't know I

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Dread what might be coming for me but that's alright

456
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Anyways so because I've had to

457
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Endure um

458
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Court

459
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I've been playing a lot of stuff on my DS

460
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Including peggle knights

461
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Which is

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Pretty fun and of course

463
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Um some

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Planet puzzle league

465
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And I actually played a little bit

466
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Of grand theft auto

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Chinatown wars

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But I got to say man

469
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Chinatown wars I just don't

470
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Dig the 2D

471
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Well not really 2D

472
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The top down old school grand theft auto

473
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Stuff I mean once you've been spoiled by

474
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Number 3 and beyond

475
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Just why go back

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I will admit I don't think I ever played more

477
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
DS than when I had um

478
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Jury duty so I feel ya

479
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's just so

480
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Terrible cause like I have to go there

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
At like 7 in the morning

482
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
To get a parking spot because

483
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Our jury is

484
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Our jury parking lot's in downtown

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Sacramento where there's

486
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
No parking because they're

487
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Dick holes that don't you know

488
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Provide adequate parking for the jury

489
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So you have to get there that early in order to get

490
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Parking and then our trial

491
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Doesn't actually start until 9 AM

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
So I'm sitting there just bored

493
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Out of my mind um

494
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
For 2 hours

495
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
They waste so much time it's just ridiculous

496
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But um in fact

497
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We were off Thursday

498
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Friday and Monday of next week

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Because our judge is on vacation

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Thank you for taking

501
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The case right before you go on vacation

502
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's awesome

503
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Um okay but anyways

504
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Other than that um I've been playing

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
More Grand Theft Auto of course um

506
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I made

507
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Back I guess um

508
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The ranks that I

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Lost from playing some sloppy

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Games um I've been taking it

511
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Out on my co-workers so I've been beating the

512
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Crap out of them very

513
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Viciously uh quadrupling

514
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Their scores at times um

515
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And then um

516
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What else

517
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Earth Defense Force 2017

518
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because that game is still fun uh finished

519
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Uh the

520
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Uh the hardest

521
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Difficulty on that so it was fun so we're going backwards

522
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Now playing around with the genocide gun

523
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And then uh I actually played a little bit

524
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Of the Crackdown 2 demo hopefully

525
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Gonna be playing the full game

526
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
By the end of this week I just have to convince them

527
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
To give me my copy because they've been sitting

528
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
On it for 2 weeks um

529
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But yeah it's pretty fun

530
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And Crackdown 2 uh pretty much just like

531
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You remember the first one it's kind of cool

532
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If you've actually played the first game you'll recognize

533
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
A lot of the stuff in the game a lot of the

534
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Locations are very similar if not

535
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The same in fact I was just kind of

536
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Walking around going wow hey I reckon

537
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh my god I wonder if this is here from the first

538
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Game oh yeah it is there it is um

539
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So that's kind of fun and the game itself

540
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You know pretty cool

541
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So I can't wait to pick that up and actually play

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Some maybe uh co-op online and what not

543
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Um

544
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But yeah that's pretty much it for right now

545
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Uh let's see my

546
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Gaming week then if we move on to me um

547
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Not a whole lot of new stuff

548
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm still making my way through Alan Wake

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
One of these days I'll beat it um

550
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But I did spend quite a bit of time on wow this

551
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Week you know addict uh which I'll

552
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Come back to in a minute um I also um

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Play a little bit of game room cause you know I love

554
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Me some classic games and one of my all time

555
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Favorite classic games came out on

556
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Game room this week H E R

557
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
O from the Atari 2600 now

558
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I played this a little more on the Commodore 64

559
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
With the slightly better graphics but you know it's still

560
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The same game I remember in a nutshell

561
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Uh the H E R O it's it's

562
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Helicopter rescue operation basically

563
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Um and you play this little guy

564
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That has a helicopter on his back and it's

565
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This cute little control mechanism and you kind of

566
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Explore caves but in

567
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The cave there are monsters and lava

568
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And all these things you have to avoid and

569
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Sometimes boats that you take actually

570
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
For 2600 game it was pretty

571
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Darn impressive I mean they really

572
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Packed a lot into the cartridge

573
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Um I would kind of compare it to like

574
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Imagine like if you could fly around in pitfall

575
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's kind of like that cause you know pitfall was an

576
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Activision game too but it was one of my favorite games

577
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Uh that came out for the 2600 but it came out right

578
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Before the big crash so I think a lot of people

579
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Missed this game but it's on game room now and you know

580
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's it's worth at least checking out the demo

581
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And see if you like it um

582
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm I tried to get a top 20 score but

583
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I found it was it was

584
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Very scary how much I remembered like

585
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Go down through the left tunnel instead

586
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Of the right tunnel or go down the third passage

587
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Like I actually remembered how to get through a lot of levels

588
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It kind of freaked me out so

589
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Uh yeah there was that that was fun

590
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Let me go back to WoW for a minute cause

591
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Something happened on World of Warcraft

592
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This week that kind of it actually

593
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Really ticked me off it really ticked me off

594
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I want to say this is what I think it is

595
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It is it's it's um a new feature well

596
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Here's the thing you know World of Warcraft one thing

597
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They do very well is that they release

598
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Content patches all the time

599
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That add new stuff to the game

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
New dungeons new features you know

601
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
One of the greatest things they've added to WoW

602
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Was just a couple patches ago the dungeon finder

603
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Uh was an amazing addition to the game

604
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That made leveling so different

605
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah it was a great addition

606
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
This patch

607
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Sprays diarrhea

608
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
All over World of Warcraft

609
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It was a terrible content patch

610
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And I'll tell you why

611
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
For one now the game crashes

612
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Every so often now if you have

613
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Souped up settings on your computer

614
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The draw distance it can't handle

615
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Then um and uh

616
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The Ruby sanctum I guess was released

617
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But it's not even open yet so what else

618
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
They can't open it until they get the patch

619
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Deployed to yeah

620
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And then they release they release this thing

621
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Called real ID

622
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Real ID is what

623
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Allows you to cross communicate

624
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Through servers through factions

625
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
To other players that you want to

626
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Communicate with that's what I thought it was

627
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's kind of their way of being

628
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Xbox live or steam I

629
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Guess well you know the battle nets

630
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Kind of slowly trying to kind of poke

631
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Poke at the steam

632
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And the uh actually I would say it's most

633
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You know what most reminds me of is Xfire I don't know if you remember

634
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Xfire but the whole way

635
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Battle nets going really reminds me of what Xfire

636
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Kind of was or is I guess

637
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I guess they're still going well they kind of want to integrate

638
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The Starcraft 2 players are going to be coming up

639
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
With the wild players

640
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But real ID here's the thing

641
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Real ID

642
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Allows you to communicate with players

643
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
On any server

644
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And on any faction while you're still in wow

645
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So that's cool

646
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But it doesn't use handles

647
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It doesn't use numbers

648
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It uses your real name

649
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
To communicate with other people

650
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It uses the name you picked

651
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
When you signed up with battle net

652
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Which defaulted to the same name

653
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That was on your credit card that you signed up with

654
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
To pay the game

655
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You cannot change your name

656
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So you must use your real name to communicate with people

657
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And I'm okay with that

658
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Because it is for your real life friends

659
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You're not supposed to be giving this to people

660
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You just randomly play wow with

661
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's what the normal Warcraft friends list is for

662
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm okay with this

663
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Here's what I'm not okay with

664
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And this is where I truly feel like

665
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Blizzard hijacked my privacy this week

666
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Is that

667
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
They copied a feature from Xbox Live

668
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Where you can view

669
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Your friends list and you can go into

670
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Any of your friends and view

671
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Their friends list

672
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Complete with their real name

673
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So in other words

674
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
If I add a friend

675
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
On this battle net system

676
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Somebody

677
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That might be trying to

678
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Find out my real name

679
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Because I don't know

680
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If it's a big secret or what have you

681
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But I don't use my real name on this program

682
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Neither does Jamie

683
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Loki obviously isn't his real name either

684
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You know we use fake names on the show

685
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That people do out there in the world

686
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Like you know Bono

687
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's not his real name

688
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Cher is probably a shortened name

689
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Madonna really is her name

690
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Cher is actually Cher's name

691
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But it's a shortened

692
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I thought she was Esther now

693
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Forget it

694
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
My point is there's a lot of people out there that don't use their real names

695
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And we don't either

696
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I actually thank Travis

697
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Back from Understation Live for making me use a fake name

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Because it's been really good

699
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I don't like my day job

700
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And my night job to conflict

701
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's nothing personal you guys

702
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But just realize I have a day job

703
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Where I

704
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Privacy is a huge component of my day job

705
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And I can't have

706
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What I do during the day and what I do during the night

707
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Conflict with each other

708
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And like if that were to happen

709
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I couldn't do this show anymore

710
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Because I have to pay my bills

711
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
This show pays me nothing

712
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So I realize that most people are pretty respectful of that

713
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But here's kind of my problem with Battle.net

714
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And I know a lot of people are like

715
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Well if you don't like it, don't use it

716
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No shit Sherlock

717
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But there's a lot of social pressure

718
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
To use it

719
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I have friends of mine asking

720
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Why won't you add me as a friend

721
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And I tell them

722
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I can't have you

723
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I can control adding you as a friend

724
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
But I can't control who you put on your friends list

725
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Well I'm not going to put anybody on there

726
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
You don't understand

727
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That and you might know that

728
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But there's some really messed up people in the world

729
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I

730
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Many years ago

731
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because of this program

732
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Had a stalker

733
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I had a stalker because of Orange Lawns Radio

734
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I don't like to talk about it a whole lot

735
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Because it's one of the few cases where

736
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I almost quit doing this show

737
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Because it was one of those cases where

738
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The day job and the night job were starting to come together

739
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I was getting inappropriate phone calls

740
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
On my cellular telephone

741
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
With somebody who

742
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I had an association with

743
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Orange Lawns Radio

744
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't often talk about it

745
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But it happened

746
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And it's not something I want to happen again

747
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
How do I know

748
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Knowing that there's people like that out in the world

749
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
These people might try to use my friends

750
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
To get to me

751
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
And you might be looking at that

752
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Going wow that sounds very tinfoil hat-ish

753
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Or wow that sounds really kind of like

754
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You're just like obsessing

755
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But I'm telling you

756
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Until it's happened to you

757
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You don't know what lengths people will go to

758
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I know

759
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
How do you think this person

760
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Got my phone number

761
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's what I'm talking about

762
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And so

763
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I am totally with you guys

764
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If you don't like it don't use it

765
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And I don't use it

766
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because I don't want that to happen ever again

767
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
But the problem is

768
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's there and now there's these social pressures

769
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And hearing guilds out there

770
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Are requiring people to use it

771
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
That is so screwed up

772
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Here's my point

773
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Blizzard is smarter than that

774
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
They should have known this would happen

775
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
When they implemented it

776
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't know what in the hell they were thinking

777
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
With this

778
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And it's not just my problem

779
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I mean what I talked about I believe is very serious

780
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But let's also consider that you have kids out there

781
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
16 and 17

782
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Whose parents are paying for their Warcraft account

783
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Absolutely

784
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Do you think parents know how to use it?

785
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Think

786
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
When you were 16 or 17

787
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Did your parents know how to totally control your gaming

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Because I'll tell you mine sure didn't

789
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And it definitely wasn't because they were bad parents

790
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It was just because I knew computers more than they did

791
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I was playing Nintendo with my mom

792
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And so

793
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If

794
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
World of Warcraft had been around when I was 16

795
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I guarantee you I would be on battle net

796
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
With my real ID with my mom's name

797
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And that's

798
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
This is like incredibly messed up

799
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So basically Blizzard failed

800
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
To account for the stupidity

801
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And maliciousness of its players

802
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Mhmm

803
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Sorry potential stupidity and maliciousness

804
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Of its players

805
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Guilds requiring that?

806
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That is insane

807
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Because they want to know

808
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If you're online

809
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's these really stupid reasons

810
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
To use real ID

811
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's just like

812
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Common sense

813
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Or you can do what I do and don't play World of Warcraft

814
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So

815
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
With Star Trek Online

816
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
They don't require you to have that stuff

817
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I know I'm trying to look at some of the

818
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Comments in our chat room

819
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Chat.orangelaunsradio.com if you want to join in

820
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Salacious Pop says

821
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
It only takes one person in an IRL guild

822
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
To add random pickup people to ruin it

823
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
For everybody else they know

824
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't control my own list but I can't control my friends list

825
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And that's what I really don't like about real ID

826
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So honestly like I understand

827
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Blizzard in a board room somewhere

828
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Must have thought this was like

829
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
A good idea to combat I don't know

830
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Gold sellers or something

831
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I have, you know what? No

832
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I can't think of why this is a good idea. I really can't

833
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Well hopefully they'll tone that down

834
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I realize we have people

835
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I'm surprised every week

836
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
At who is actually listening to Orange Lounge Radio

837
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Cause like didn't we have a guy email or call

838
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That was like oh yeah I worked at Infinity Ward

839
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I was there

840
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I was like really? I didn't know we had

841
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
People that worked there to listen to this show

842
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If we have anyone that works at

843
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Active Blizzard that listens to this program

844
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Will you please

845
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Please help us get this

846
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Fixed because it is

847
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Just an embarrassment to World of Warcraft

848
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Right now. You know it

849
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Makes about as much sense as

850
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Locking down your Facebook privacy

851
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Settings and I think they need to do

852
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The same thing. I know they tried to make

853
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Battle.net a little more social

854
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
A little more Facebook like

855
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But they stumbled on

856
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The same problem that Facebook had

857
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Privacy, seeing friends of

858
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Friends that you might not want to see

859
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I mean I keep my Facebook

860
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Locked down tighter than a frog's ass

861
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
For a reason

862
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well yeah if they want to go the Facebook route though

863
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Facebook lets me change my name

864
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I use my radio name on Facebook

865
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Because I actually don't want day people to find out

866
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's just crazy

867
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I don't want to say it's a dual life I live because I have one life

868
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But I'm just very conscious about

869
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
My internet trail

870
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And I think you have to be in this day and age

871
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And I find the easiest way to separate your internet trail

872
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Is to use two names. It's very easy

873
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
When you do it that way

874
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Well you know actually I'm going to tell you this

875
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The reason why I leave my actual name up there

876
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Is because I'm looking to get hired

877
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Right and I don't need that right now

878
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm marketing myself

879
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And everyone's got their own reasons for it

880
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I think that actually it's

881
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But you know Facebook has this thing that

882
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
In their little rules or whatever

883
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That says if they find out that you're using a pseudonym

884
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
That they can't delete your account

885
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So anyway

886
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Tiger Claw Chat says

887
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
If Blizzard listens to this show they need to pay attention

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Sky is their biggest customer

889
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I appreciate the sediment

890
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And usually I'm one of the biggest proponents of Blizzard

891
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But people that actually get suckered into

892
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Going to Blizzcon are much bigger

893
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Customers than I am

894
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yes I think you're kind of a sucker if you go to Blizzcon

895
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And there's people I know and love that go to Blizzcon

896
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And it's you know

897
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
It's just my personal feeling

898
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Well and that's the whole thing is that

899
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's not like Blizzard doesn't get enough money out of you

900
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Why don't you come attend for $150

901
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This three day commercial

902
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
No thanks I'd like to be able to afford your next expansion

903
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Exactly

904
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
That's what Blizzcon basically

905
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I'd rather just play your damn game

906
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Anyhow I'm getting way off topic and there's people

907
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That really don't want to hear this whole spiel

908
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm just saying

909
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I think this is important to talk about

910
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
For a lot of different games

911
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Because you know Blizzard sets the standard

912
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
With a lot of things

913
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This is one scary ass standard I don't want them setting

914
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't complain about Xbox Live

915
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Because I can change my name on Xbox Live

916
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I don't complain about Facebook

917
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Because I can change my name on Facebook

918
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I can lock it down to quote the ever eloquent

919
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Drunami tighter than a frog's ass

920
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I cannot change my name on Blizzard

921
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They hijacked it from my credit card

922
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And gave me what they would be using my name for

923
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And that was wrong

924
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That was wrong

925
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Ok

926
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yay rant stud happy show happy birthday

927
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Happy show

928
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Alright Drunami what have you been playing

929
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh god how was my gaming year

930
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Well yeah in a nutshell

931
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I've been playing a whole crap load of WoW lately

932
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I've actually been getting into the ratings scene

933
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Staying in the ratings scene

934
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Right now I imagine Arthas is just

935
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Sitting on his throne like Conan looking bored

936
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
R.P. Guild

937
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But I've also been taking advantage

938
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Of a lot of Steam sales

939
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I am a consumer whore

940
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And how

941
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm buying a hell of a lot of Steam games

942
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Playing a whole lot of Steam games

943
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Oh have you seen the sale this week

944
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh god I did take advantage of Left 4 Dead 2

945
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Civ 4 is on sale again today

946
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I took advantage of Left 4 Dead 2

947
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Two days ago

948
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Yesterday they cut the price in half

949
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Don't you hate that

950
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And I raged

951
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Steam is like gambling sometimes

952
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then I shot zombies

953
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Then I shot zombies

954
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I have been really getting into

955
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The Mass Effect series

956
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I played through Mass Effect 2 for the past couple months

957
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Loved the hell out of it

958
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Waiting for the third game in the trilogy

959
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I gotta jump in here real quick

960
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
This is a very important question in chat I want to answer

961
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Blaze in our chat room says

962
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Is this real ID nonsense going to be in

963
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Starcraft 2 and or more importantly

964
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
To me at least Diablo 3

965
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yes

966
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So that's why even if you don't play WoW

967
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Blizzard has a lock on some other PC gaming

968
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And I think it's important that

969
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You check

970
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Check it out because you know

971
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That's why they rushed this patch

972
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Because Starcraft 2 is hitting shelves what next week

973
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
July 27th

974
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Oh I thought it was like July 7th ok but soon

975
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So they had to implement the patch anyway sorry

976
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I just wanted to get that out there because it's a very important question

977
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
That needed answering from our chat room

978
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Lots of Mass Effect 2 lots of Killing Fool

979
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
A very underrated

980
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
First person shooter

981
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's no Left 4 Dead but it's definitely underrated

982
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Console wise

983
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Not a whole lot

984
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
The new Tales

985
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
The Tales Symphonia sequel was good

986
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I've been replaying that

987
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Finally got around to beating No More Heroes

988
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But otherwise it's just been a whole lot of WoW

989
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And a surprising amount of FPS

990
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I did finally get to play WoW

991
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Saints Row 2

992
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Mostly because a friend of mine gifted it to me

993
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And Loki you were into that right?

994
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Saints Row 2?

995
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah

996
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It had a lot of bugs for the PC port though

997
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
The PC port wasn't very good

998
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh yeah it just

999
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It was still a fun game

1000
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Just not as fun

1001
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And let's see I was playing Trine

1002
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Not Twine, Trine

1003
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Had a lot of fun

1004
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Not Twine, Trine

1005
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Had a lot of fun with that

1006
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yeah it was a lot of fun

1007
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Isn't that a LucasArts game?

1008
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
No

1009
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It was an indie game

1010
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
They had it on sale a couple months back

1011
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I think they had it on sale the first day of this big segment

1012
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Oh god

1013
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Valve wants my money

1014
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
They really do

1015
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Other than that, that's about it

1016
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I want your money as well

1017
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You're not getting my money

1018
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So Dan is here in studio

1019
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
We can't hear him because he's not on the mic

1020
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
How you doing Dan?

1021
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Greetings

1022
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Since you decided to bless our show

1023
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't want to talk about games

1024
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But I want a moment of your show's time

1025
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I want everyone to have a very very brief moment of silence

1026
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Can I just say it's our birthday

1027
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
To mourn the passing of Game Crazy this week

1028
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
As of Wednesday

1029
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
All Game Crazies closed down

1030
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Wasn't Wednesday our birthday?

1031
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Leaving me super unemployed

1032
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Wednesday was our birthday

1033
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Happy Birthday!

1034
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So everybody, send me your money

1035
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm not worried about identity

1036
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
If you want to send me some money

1037
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I'll just give you my name

1038
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's Rob

1039
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Rob

1040
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Send your money to Rob

1041
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
He'll get it to me

1042
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yes, send Rob your money

1043
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I'll be sure Dan gets all of it

1044
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Be sure to send cash

1045
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I want his real name and address

1046
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I got it

1047
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I will hook you up

1048
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I know where he'll be every Sunday

1049
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Every Sunday

1050
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I know right where he's at

1051
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I got this

1052
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Dan, you're ignoring OLR tonight

1053
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
To partake in the Mario Marathon, correct?

1054
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No, not really

1055
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
If I was ignoring OLR

1056
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I would be talking to you

1057
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You were a minute ago

1058
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You were on the couch watching Mario Marathon

1059
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Those guys are not very good Mario players

1060
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
But it's for a good cause

1061
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Okay, it's for a good cause

1062
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We were actually sort of talking about that we should do something like that

1063
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Except you need to play Sonic

1064
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Except for you though

1065
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Something awesome

1066
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Hey, Tigerclaw's got a great suggestion in our chatroom

1067
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Maybe Dan can be on OLR more often

1068
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Now that he's jobless

1069
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And he can tell game crazy stories

1070
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I never worked on Sunday

1071
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I just didn't want to talk to y'all

1072
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I live with him

1073
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
So I'm going to be on medical leave while he's off

1074
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh my god, one of you two is going to kill the other

1075
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Because you're both not going to be working

1076
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Yeah, tell me about it

1077
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So anyways, if anyone knows a job

1078
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't care what it is

1079
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I'll shovel crap

1080
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I'll play Sega games, whatever

1081
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Just give me your money

1082
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That means you, Andrew

1083
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Next week on

1084
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio

1085
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
It's the Jamie and Dan

1086
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Household survivor

1087
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Dan?

1088
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I know where you live

1089
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Only one of them can survive

1090
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I know

1091
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
A fight to the death

1092
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I know you know

1093
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
We're going to do Paper Plate Battle Royale again

1094
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What are you talking about?

1095
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
By the way, by the way

1096
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I just saw something that makes me incredibly excited

1097
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
For my big DS9 fangirlism

1098
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Is that episode 2 for Star Trek Online

1099
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Is going to be launching on July 15th

1100
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And they're including mini games

1101
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And one of them is Dabo

1102
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh, Rama in chat says Dan should apply to Best Buy

1103
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Uh, no

1104
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I was waiting for a comment from the living room

1105
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Dan!

1106
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Are they hiring?

1107
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Are they hiring?

1108
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I don't think he values his soul that much

1109
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh, oh, oh my god

1110
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Tigerclaw, brilliant

1111
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Dan can try to sign in

1112
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
To be a contestant in the latest

1113
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Season of the tester

1114
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That showed that they're casting

1115
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
For season 2 of the tester

1116
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Dan should go on the tester

1117
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, you know every other thing he says would be

1118
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And I play this beep game beep beep

1119
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Beep game beep

1120
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
That's a brilliant idea, Dan!

1121
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
What?

1122
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You need to go on reality television

1123
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I thought I was on reality television

1124
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
No, we're going to put you on season 2

1125
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Of the tester

1126
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah, I mean you're on reality radio now

1127
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
No one listens to this show

1128
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And no one watches the tester

1129
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It'll be a perfect transition

1130
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Chirp chirp

1131
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, Dan's back, hooray, my yelling worked

1132
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
The tester, you know that reality show on

1133
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
PlayStation Network season 2 is coming up

1134
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
There's shows on PlayStation Network?

1135
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yes, you could be

1136
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Is PlayStation Network where you go on when you're not on Xbox Live?

1137
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yes, there's actually going to have this whole

1138
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Plus thing soon too, it's crazy

1139
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The only reason I want to go on PlayStation Network is

1140
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What is that new game that looks like Strider

1141
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
That's four players

1142
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't know, but

1143
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
You could be a Sony game tester

1144
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Sony games kind of suck

1145
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Don't screw yourself

1146
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
$10,000 to the winner

1147
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Necromachina

1148
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's not really that much money

1149
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, Necromachina, you should check that out

1150
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That game looks awesome

1151
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's on PlayStation Network

1152
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Are you playing Mario Crossover?

1153
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah, they have the new version

1154
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Are you in it now?

1155
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I set mine up to work with my gamepad

1156
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's Rad to the Max

1157
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So I've been playing Mario Crossover this week

1158
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And I've still been playing Mario Brothers X

1159
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
There's my weekend gaming

1160
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And I finished Red Dead Redemption and it was sad at the end

1161
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Really?

1162
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Jimmy wants this game too

1163
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Jimmy wants everything

1164
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I got no money

1165
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Unless you send me some, send me money so I can buy my wife games

1166
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Good luck to you in the job search

1167
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Is this done by the same guy that did Strider?

1168
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You're a hard worker

1169
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You know, we have people that listen to this show

1170
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That knew you

1171
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
From your store

1172
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That was like, oh my god, Jamie's married to the guy at that store

1173
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Jamie's married to that big jerk

1174
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Who works at Funkoland

1175
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That poor woman

1176
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You guys don't know what it's like here

1177
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
She's insane

1178
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Alright

1179
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Let's move on, we gotta get into gaming news

1180
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Thank you, Dan

1181
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Alright, housekeeping

1182
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And things that are coming up

1183
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
No show next week

1184
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
We already talked about that

1185
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Oh, I wanna mention this real quick

1186
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
iOS 4 is out

1187
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Which is the iPhone thing

1188
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You know, iPad software

1189
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
One of the things that's new in the iOS 4

1190
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And I'm not just talking about the iPhone 4

1191
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I mean, yes, that's out too

1192
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But we realize a lot of people listen to this show

1193
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
On their iPhones, their iPods, their iTouches

1194
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There's other devices too

1195
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
We are aware

1196
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
One of the new things

1197
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
In iOS 4 is that the show descriptions

1198
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Are actually now displayed

1199
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
On the screen while you listen to the podcast

1200
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So we're gonna try in a couple weeks

1201
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Something new with the notes for the show

1202
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And we think you'll really like it

1203
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But they're gonna be kind of expanded

1204
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
And time stamped

1205
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So we're gonna try something new

1206
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And we're hoping you guys will like it

1207
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But that'll be in two weeks

1208
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
On the podcast, or really the next podcast

1209
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That'll hit the feed after this one

1210
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's gonna take more work that goes into it though

1211
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So, alright

1212
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Appreciate it

1213
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yeah, I think people will like it

1214
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It's kind of been a requested feature for a while

1215
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So we'll see what happens

1216
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Alright, anyhow, we're only 45 minutes into the show

1217
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And it barely touched gaming news

1218
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
How about some video game news?

1219
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
We'll start off tonight with the one and only Loki

1220
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes, so it's been confirmed

1221
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That the 3DS is coming out in 2011

1222
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Now, of course

1223
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Before Reggie actually

1224
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show

1225
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yes, apparently

1226
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is now a news

1227
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Source

1228
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It was announced that the

1229
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
3DS would be out in

1230
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Fiscal 2010

1231
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I believe that's Fiscal 2010

1232
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Which would be

1233
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Between now and

1234
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
March 31st, 2011

1235
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But now it's been confirmed that it's actually

1236
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Gonna launch in 2011

1237
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Do the math, it's gonna be the first 3 months

1238
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Of the year

1239
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And, uh

1240
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah, that's neat I guess

1241
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Hmm

1242
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Kinda disappointing I guess if you're looking forward

1243
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
To it for Christmas, but hey

1244
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
There's enough crap coming out during Christmas

1245
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
One less thing, I can deal

1246
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
With that

1247
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I totally agree that it's very

1248
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Strange that Jimmy Fallon has now become

1249
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
This kind of launching point for games, cause I guess

1250
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It was actually part of like a week of games or something

1251
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Cause I don't know if you watch

1252
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I don't know if you watch the clip

1253
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But Reggie kinda takes a jab

1254
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I believe it's Sony because he says something about

1255
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And, uh, it's not like the guys that were here last night

1256
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You don't need glasses to see this 3D

1257
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
He said something like that in the clip

1258
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So it was, you know, it was just Reggie being Reggie

1259
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You know

1260
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And, um, yeah

1261
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I mean, kind of a bummer though that it's

1262
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Not coming out until 2011

1263
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But I totally wanna bet with GamerEidi

1264
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
And now I'm getting a lunch spot for me

1265
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So GamerEidi, if you're listening

1266
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I like steak, just saying

1267
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm just kidding

1268
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Well, I'm actually not kidding, I did win a bet

1269
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But, um

1270
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Do you think it was intended

1271
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Maybe for Reggie to say this on the show

1272
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Cause this seems like an odd place

1273
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
To give details about the release date

1274
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Or do you think it just kinda slipped

1275
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't think it slipped, I think it's just that people

1276
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
When they, I mean, they announced

1277
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Fiscal 2010

1278
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And people were like, oh my god, I'm buying it in 2010

1279
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Woooo

1280
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And so, instead of just everybody being disappointed

1281
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
You know, by figuring out that, hey

1282
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
It's not coming out at holiday

1283
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
He just went ahead and announced it

1284
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So that, you know

1285
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
You don't have to assume anymore

1286
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Um

1287
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
What do you think this leaves for

1288
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Cause a lot of people were speculating that 3DS

1289
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And on our nightly shows for me

1290
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
3, 2, I know Shane and I were having some discussions

1291
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
On this, that the

1292
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
3DS really had to come out this year

1293
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Like, what else does Nintendo have for Christmas

1294
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So what do you think the holidays

1295
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
What do you think the holiday season's gonna look like for Nintendo

1296
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I think it's gonna be all their games

1297
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The Kirby and the Donkey Kong

1298
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Not everything, I mean

1299
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Donkey Kong I think and Kirby are gonna be this year

1300
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I think Kirby's gonna be the one that's in November

1301
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Um, there's a lot of stuff

1302
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I think for October, there's also a lot of stuff that they

1303
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Haven't announced, or announced last year

1304
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Uh, stuff that was shown on

1305
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
E3 last year is coming out

1306
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I know there's a game on

1307
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
The Wii, or

1308
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I can't remember if it was the Wii or DS

1309
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It was one of the ones I saw last year though

1310
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Um, so there's still stuff

1311
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
That come out

1312
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
For live me, I can't remember the timeline for uh

1313
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Was it Metroid Other M?

1314
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's August 31st

1315
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It was supposed to be out a couple days ago

1316
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Cause I remember it was my birthday weekend

1317
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Actually today, I think it was supposed to be out today

1318
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But it got pushed back

1319
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Well, that'll be a Christmas gift idea

1320
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Yes, that's right, that came out instead

1321
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Nope, I have not played it yet

1322
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah, I didn't really play the first one to be honest

1323
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
My Wii is still not hooked up

1324
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I will probably not be hooking it up until Metroid Other M comes out

1325
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Cause I gotta play that

1326
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I've gotta play Metroid Other M

1327
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It does look cool

1328
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Um, but yeah, I just

1329
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I haven't played

1330
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Um, the Wii console since

1331
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
November, I think?

1332
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Some comments in our chat room about

1333
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Pokemon Black and White

1334
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Pokemon Black and White is asking

1335
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Is Pokemon Black and White cancelled?

1336
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Um, no

1337
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I believe they even announced a release date

1338
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
October 19th in Japan

1339
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Wasn't it even sooner than that?

1340
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Like the 18th of September, I thought I read?

1341
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No, it was October

1342
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Regardless, it's fall in Japan

1343
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, fall in Japan

1344
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So it won't have 3DS support

1345
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I bet you anything it'll be out April

1346
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
In the US

1347
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Because that's usually when they've been releasing

1348
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Pokemon games around the April time frame

1349
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Alright

1350
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Well, we'll see if you're right or not

1351
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I guess that's true, this last little one with the Pokewalker

1352
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Ball came out in April-ish

1353
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Uh, that's March

1354
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
That's right, it was right before PAX East

1355
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But, Pokemon

1356
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
HeartGold, SoulSilver, that was March

1357
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Pokemon Platinum was March

1358
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Pokemon

1359
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Explorers of the Sky

1360
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Explorers of Time, that was April

1361
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Uh

1362
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Diamond Pearl was April

1363
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
So, yeah

1364
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's usually March or April

1365
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Uh, AlphaCananagram is speculating

1366
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
in our chatroom at chat.orangetonjr.com

1367
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I wouldn't doubt Pokemon Black and White

1368
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
will have 3DS compatibility

1369
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Remember, Pokemon Red and Blue

1370
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
had colors written in the programming for

1371
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Super Game Boy

1372
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But the 3DS cards are a little bigger

1373
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Maybe it won't matter, I don't know

1374
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Could be like the advanced dungeons in Zelda

1375
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's what I think of

1376
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
They might, I mean

1377
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I would say if anything it's gonna have

1378
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
DSi support, probably not

1379
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
3DS

1380
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It might have some really silly stuff, like the whole game

1381
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
won't be in 3D, but maybe like the evolution scenes

1382
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
or something silly, just like little one-off

1383
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
things will be in 3D, little little things

1384
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We'll see

1385
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I don't think so, and the only reason why is because they're gonna be in the old carts

1386
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and it's gonna be too hard to

1387
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
hold that extra data on there

1388
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But DSi support's been something that they've been doing

1389
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
a lot with different games, not necessarily

1390
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
You don't have to play it on the

1391
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
DSi, but if you do, you can

1392
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
do different things

1393
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Also some other comments in chat

1394
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Rama's a big fan of the 3DS

1395
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
saying, I will get a 3DS and I will shank someone

1396
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
if I have to, I think a lot of people feel that way actually

1397
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Frisbee is trying to top us all

1398
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
saying, I haven't played my Wii since 2008

1399
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I'm curious though

1400
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
if Frisbee's gonna break it out for anything

1401
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
that Nintendo announced this year

1402
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I did play Wii Sports Golf

1403
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
on

1404
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Friday because they were setting up something

1405
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
for some company

1406
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
that we had coming into our work

1407
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
They were having a Wii Sports Golf tournament

1408
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't think day job stuff should count though, to be honest

1409
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well in that case, I don't play Grand Theft Auto ever

1410
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Well

1411
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Okay, you do that on your break though, but I get what you're saying

1412
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Well technically it wasn't working

1413
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
if I'm playing Wii Sports Golf

1414
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But I asked them

1415
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
like, why don't you have Wii Sports

1416
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Resort Golf? That would be better

1417
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Maybe they're just not ready for that

1418
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
No, they're just lame

1419
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Alright, well I believe Loki warned you about this

1420
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
to go to another console real quick

1421
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I believe Loki warned you about this last week

1422
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
when all the E3 news was hitting

1423
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
but it does seem like it has been confirmed

1424
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
In fact, a Microsoft representative this week actually spoke to the blog

1425
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q

1426
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm sure a lot of you know that blog

1427
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Microsoft representative confirmed to them that

1428
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
a $199 version

1429
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
of their new Xbox 360

1430
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
which they're now calling the

1431
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
short Xbox 360

1432
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
let me put that in quotes

1433
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
they're not calling it the slim now, which is good

1434
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
because we talked about this last week

1435
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
it is not the Xbox 360 slim

1436
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
it has another name

1437
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
so anyway, it is going to be coming out for $199

1438
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
there is also

1439
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
a new setup that's going to have the

1440
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Xbox system and Kinect together

1441
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
which I think a lot of people knew

1442
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
so there you go

1443
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
$199 Xbox 360

1444
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
system coming out soon

1445
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
no date, no idea

1446
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
probably what, fall-ish, I think you were predicting

1447
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Loki, before the holidays for sure

1448
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
for the new system

1449
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I bet you

1450
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
well the new with the

1451
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Kinect isn't coming out until when the

1452
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Kinect does, so that will be November 4th

1453
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I bet you the $199

1454
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
system probably as

1455
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
early as

1456
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
September

1457
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
just to cash in on Halo Reach

1458
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
so in other words

1459
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
if you were thinking about

1460
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
getting an Xbox right now, wait

1461
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
well wait and see

1462
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
anyways because you know how they

1463
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
saying that there is going to be a new $199

1464
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
what if they're just dropping the price of the system

1465
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
to $199

1466
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
you never know

1467
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I would think though

1468
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
if anything, I mean they do a lot of their

1469
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
price drops and big pushes towards

1470
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
the holiday and especially when they

1471
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
want to capitalize on a game like Halo

1472
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Reach, just wait for

1473
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
some better deals to be coming

1474
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
out and besides, even if you wait longer

1475
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
what they've been doing

1476
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
in the past is bundling in some games

1477
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
with your Xbox 360

1478
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
system for free, so

1479
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
if you do wait, you still might get some free stuff

1480
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
AlphaKananagram in our chat room

1481
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
at chat.org.com is asking, wait how much

1482
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
is this bundle, did they say, I must

1483
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
know for Child of Eden, everyone's speculating

1484
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
what, $300? I think $300

1485
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
well $299

1486
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
is what the system is right now

1487
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
it might be $399

1488
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
hmm

1489
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I wonder if there'll be a basic version with

1490
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Kinect though, I bet there is

1491
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
it's hard to say, if they're gonna

1492
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
do, well

1493
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I don't know, they could do a smaller hard drive

1494
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
because the hard drive is removable, it is

1495
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
just like the PS3

1496
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I know, isn't that awesome?

1497
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
it is awesome

1498
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
alright, lowkey, how big is the hard drive

1499
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
are you gonna try to put a terabyte drive in there?

1500
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I'm not getting a new system, oh yeah you don't need one

1501
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
you have like five Xbox 360s

1502
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I wish I had five Xbox 360s

1503
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I don't know how many

1504
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Xbox 360s I have anymore

1505
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
that's crazy, that's awesome though

1506
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
alright, well speaking about the Xbox 360

1507
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
it doesn't look like

1508
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
they're gonna really be getting Final Fantasy 14

1509
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
because

1510
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
their system is so different

1511
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
they were wanting to play

1512
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
like a normal internet environment

1513
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and wanted to basically

1514
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
for the console to mirror how it works on the PC

1515
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and Microsoft

1516
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
has a closed environment

1517
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
so they still can't work up an agreement

1518
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
yet

1519
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
seems so odd to me because

1520
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I remember being at E3

1521
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
a couple years ago when the Xbox 360

1522
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
was just coming out, like it was the big year

1523
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
that they were gonna launch the 360 and one of the games

1524
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
that they were highlighting as like

1525
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
landmark on that platform was Final Fantasy 11

1526
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
so it's not like

1527
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Xbox Live has never had an MMO

1528
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
and ironically it was the game that came out

1529
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
in the same series as this game

1530
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
we're hearing about now

1531
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
which looks suspiciously similar

1532
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
well that's a whole other Oprah

1533
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
but Final Fantasy 11

1534
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I don't think it did that well

1535
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
on the 360 and I really don't have

1536
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
anything to base it off of

1537
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
but I'm just kind of knowing who played it

1538
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
what systems they were playing on

1539
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I don't think it did well on the 360 because

1540
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
most people who wanted to play it already had it

1541
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
on PS2 and PC

1542
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
you know what I mean? I don't know if that

1543
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
set a bad precedent for MMOs in general

1544
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
but if that was the case, that seems kind of crappy to me

1545
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
but there's one other MMO

1546
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
on Xbox 360 right now and that's Fantasy

1547
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Star Universe. Again, I don't think that

1548
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
did very well either

1549
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
They also were trying to get champions online

1550
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
they said that the game

1551
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
ran just fine, it was the business

1552
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
end of getting everything in line

1553
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It seems strange to me that Microsoft

1554
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
is kind of shooting themselves in the foot

1555
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
with these MMOs, especially with Final Fantasy 14

1556
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and DC Universe, both slated

1557
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
for the PS3 this fall

1558
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I mean, this could be where the

1559
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
and what, PS3 has their own agency

1560
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
we know it's coming out too? What MMOs

1561
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
are on their way for 360? Are there any at this point

1562
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
that we know of? No

1563
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
If any, they need a recent

1564
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
MMO like Final Fantasy 14

1565
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I mean, if trends

1566
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
are to be believed, they got

1567
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
MMOs that were sort of past their prime

1568
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's kind of just our universe

1569
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
but that didn't really take off

1570
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
the way that PSO did

1571
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Or they're turning their nose up at MMOs

1572
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
which, you know, they could get away with doing

1573
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
possibly. MMOs have always

1574
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
You know, Sony somewhat is

1575
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I don't know if they're necessarily taking a risk

1576
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
but the developers are taking a risk putting the games out

1577
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
on PS3, but I don't know

1578
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Like, again, I really enjoy

1579
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
DC Universe on the PS3 that I

1580
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
played at E3

1581
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and I could see myself paying money for that

1582
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
on the PlayStation 3

1583
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
If they succeed, then

1584
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
they're just going to have to catch up

1585
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I don't know, it just seems very

1586
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
strange to me that they would not

1587
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
be trying to bend over backwards to get Final Fantasy

1588
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
14 on their system, but maybe they're thinking

1589
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
you know what, 11 didn't do that great

1590
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
so 14's not going to either

1591
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
I have no idea

1592
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I think Microsoft has their own agenda

1593
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Comment from Salacious Pop

1594
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
in chat, and this is something he was telling me about

1595
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
earlier today, and I want to share this with you guys too

1596
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Champions Online was developed

1597
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
for a 360 release

1598
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Even playing the PC version

1599
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
you can see the 360 integration

1600
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
screaming at you from the UI

1601
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Champions Online was a huge flop

1602
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
and it probably has to do with the fact that at least

1603
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
50% of its platform audience never

1604
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
actually got the game

1605
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So there you go

1606
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Champions Online

1607
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
maybe was, unfortunately

1608
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
did end by this whole fact that

1609
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
the 360 was not going to be having its MMO

1610
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
or made it too difficult

1611
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Unfortunate

1612
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Bochikawa says

1613
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
PS3 is a free online service

1614
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
same on PC, I think Microsoft lost

1615
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
majorly because of that

1616
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Well keep in mind, I can't remember for PSU

1617
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
but I know for Final Fantasy 11

1618
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
it would work with a silver account

1619
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The really crazy thing about

1620
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Final Fantasy 11 I think people sometimes forget

1621
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
is that it had this whole

1622
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
play online front end

1623
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
they're not going to have that for Final Fantasy 14

1624
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
thank god

1625
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Play Online was cool for like 30 days

1626
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and then it was like, this thing is a pain in the butt

1627
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Play Online was never cool

1628
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Play Online was never cool

1629
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I thought it was cool when it first came out

1630
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
but that was it. But anyhow

1631
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Play Online is on the 360 version

1632
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
but here's the crazy thing about Play Online

1633
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's a joint venture between

1634
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Square Enix and

1635
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and Sony

1636
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Play Online is a

1637
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Sony code and it was on

1638
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
the 360

1639
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Final Fantasy 11

1640
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
was a really not typical

1641
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
game on the 360

1642
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
it broke all the rules

1643
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
but they were excited to have a Final Fantasy game on their

1644
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
console, they let it break the rules

1645
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
just like they let Castlevania

1646
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
break the rules and it ended up setting a

1647
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
precedent with the whole

1648
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Symphony of the Night coming out on the arcade

1649
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
breaking the cap

1650
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Keep in mind, in Japan

1651
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Symphony of the Night did come out on the Saturn

1652
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
What's that have to do with the 360

1653
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
one though? Because

1654
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
even back in the day

1655
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Sony didn't

1656
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
have the whole exclusive

1657
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
it was supposed to have been

1658
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
exclusive and then the Saturn version came out

1659
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
which apparently had all the stuff that the programmers

1660
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
never got to put in. I see, I get you

1661
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
so

1662
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I don't know, it would be interesting to see

1663
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
what kind of comes of that

1664
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And the Saturn version was better. I think honestly

1665
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
if you haven't heard of it by this point Final Fantasy 14

1666
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
will not be on the 360

1667
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
release date anyway. Can they add it

1668
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
next year if the game becomes popular?

1669
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Maybe, but I don't know

1670
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I don't know

1671
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
guys, I really don't

1672
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I'll try Final Fantasy 14 but I'm just kind of like

1673
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
there's something about it

1674
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I have a really bad feeling

1675
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
it's gonna flop

1676
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I don't know what it is

1677
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I think just because 11 was so received mixed

1678
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
and I don't think the

1679
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
PS3 is as adopted as the PS2

1680
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
was and the 360

1681
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I don't know, call me crazy

1682
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
What's funny is there's still a Final Fantasy

1683
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
14 SKU on Xbox 360

1684
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
it still exists

1685
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
whether it's actually gonna come out or not

1686
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Well I think it's a place holder

1687
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You know what though, there might be a lot that

1688
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
they're developing that they don't plan on releasing

1689
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I mean maybe a 360 version is further

1690
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
along than any of us are giving credit for

1691
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
because one other thing I don't know if we

1692
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
talked about when we did the E3 report but

1693
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Final Fantasy 14 also supports 3D

1694
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
right now. You can put on 3D glasses

1695
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
if you have those uber monitors for your PC

1696
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
you can play Final Fantasy 14 in 3D

1697
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
so, but they

1698
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
they took great caution to

1699
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
tell us

1700
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
we're messing with this right now, we don't know if it's

1701
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
gonna be in the full release

1702
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
this is a concept thing that you're seeing

1703
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
so, who knows there

1704
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Bochikawa in our chatroom

1705
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
says 14 will suck, yes, but it will still sell

1706
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
we'll see, we'll see

1707
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
again, I hate to base my opinion

1708
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
off an early build of the game

1709
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I do believe though, I think

1710
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
if 14 gets delayed to next year

1711
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
it's not bad news

1712
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
but that's just me

1713
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
anyhow, Loki, what do you got for us?

1714
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Apparently there's a rumor coming

1715
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
from Bloomberg saying

1716
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
that Sony may

1717
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
close a deal

1718
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
securing the rights

1719
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
to bring Hulu

1720
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
to the PlayStation Network, it says the partnership

1721
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
could be announced as soon as next

1722
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
week and

1723
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
that's kind of interesting since

1724
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
you know, apparently there's

1725
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
also a similar report saying that

1726
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
it might be coming to Xbox 360

1727
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
and the iPad as well

1728
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and would offer a premium Hulu

1729
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
service where you could possibly pay

1730
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
for maybe streaming of old

1731
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
you know, archive stuff

1732
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
kind of

1733
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
interesting actually that

1734
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
they're thinking about bringing to that platform

1735
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I don't know, I think it'll eventually

1736
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
probably make its way to

1737
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
each console platform

1738
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
except for the Wii maybe

1739
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
but why not, you can kind of

1740
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
do it right now with, well you could have done it

1741
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
before with the web browser, you can do it with

1742
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
third party software like diversity and stuff

1743
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
like that, but

1744
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I could definitely see this happening

1745
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It's interesting that Hulu keeps coming up

1746
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
time and time again, like it's just like

1747
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
it happened already, darn it

1748
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
yeah

1749
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
it's just

1750
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
a matter of time

1751
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
we're just waiting to see what

1752
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
happens

1753
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
alright, well something I really don't think

1754
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
you need to wait much longer to see if it happens or not

1755
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
has to do with the price of Kinect

1756
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
you know what we've been saying

1757
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
you know, as have most of the gaming press

1758
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
that Kinect is going to cost you

1759
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
$150, but Microsoft for whatever reason

1760
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
just won't confirm it, like

1761
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
they will not tell you the price of Kinect

1762
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
but then this week, on the official

1763
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Microsoft store, that's right

1764
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
online, you know, Microsoft has a store online

1765
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
just like Apple does, and a lot of different companies do

1766
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
they now are selling the Kinect

1767
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
sensor for the Xbox 360 for

1768
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
$149.99

1769
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
so there you go

1770
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
that's like, what a week costs

1771
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
yeah, interesting, huh

1772
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I really hope this comes with

1773
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
a bundle in game, cause just

1774
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
$150 for the device itself

1775
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
it better come with a bundle of several games

1776
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
ow, I shot myself in the foot

1777
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
well

1778
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
the rumor is, it is

1779
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
coming bundled with a game

1780
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
oh really, Loki, what have you heard?

1781
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
um, I heard that there's going to be a pack-in game

1782
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
not sure what it is

1783
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
um, I don't think it's anything that's probably been

1784
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
announced yet, it's probably just tech demos

1785
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
well not tech demos, but like

1786
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
remember how Wii Sports was

1787
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
that was all their tech demos

1788
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
that'd be my guess

1789
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
it could be very well

1790
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
one of like, Kinect Sports or something like that, you never know

1791
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
well one other quick thing on Kinect I want to get

1792
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
out there is that if you were unable to go to

1793
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
E3, and you happen to

1794
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
live near a Microsoft store

1795
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
there's not a lot of these, there's like

1796
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
four, I think there's like two in Southern California

1797
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
one in Arizona, I want to say

1798
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
there's not a lot of these, there's like four Microsoft

1799
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
stores, they're kind of like Apple

1800
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
stores, but instead of Apple

1801
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
it's Microsoft

1802
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
you can play the Kinect in the stores

1803
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
they actually have the demos right now

1804
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Kinectimals, according to the official

1805
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Twitter for the stores, which is at

1806
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
the Microsoft store on Twitter

1807
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
is the game that's being shown off right now

1808
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
so it sounds like they were going to rotate in

1809
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
different Kinect games

1810
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
you know what I noticed when they have a new piece of

1811
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
interface technology, remember when the DS

1812
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
was just released and they just

1813
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
had games

1814
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
that amounted to just tech demos, I mean like

1815
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Yoshi Touch and Go

1816
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and then for the first

1817
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
first part of the lifespan of the Wii

1818
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
they just had games that were mostly just tech demos

1819
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I would hope since

1820
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
the motion sensor technology has matured by now

1821
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
that Microsoft would have

1822
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
more than glorified tech demos

1823
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
well the technology has matured but unfortunately

1824
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
people and developers

1825
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
have not matured and

1826
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I understand that developers

1827
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
can do way better than what's out there

1828
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
right now, but people like what's

1829
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
out there right now and so that's why they're

1830
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
emulating the same stuff you see on other systems

1831
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
like a Wii sports type game

1832
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
a Wii sports resort type game

1833
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
a party game

1834
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
you know that kind of stuff

1835
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
since you brought up the DS launch titles though

1836
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I have to say this because this always cracks me up

1837
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
you know what DS game

1838
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I don't know if it was a launch title but it came out in the first

1839
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
three months, it was a launch

1840
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I owned Ping Pals

1841
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Oh it was so terrible, Ping Pals was so

1842
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I bought two copies, I was coerced into buying

1843
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
two copies

1844
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
it was so terrible, but here's why

1845
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
it was this awesome DS game

1846
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I say awesome very sarcastically by the way

1847
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
where you could chat

1848
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
with other people on their

1849
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
nearby DS's by like

1850
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
drawing and you could do these

1851
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
draw chats back and forth

1852
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
and that's what Ping Pals was all about

1853
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
it was PictoChat with avatars

1854
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
boy Nintendo fucked them over

1855
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
didn't they by putting that in their system

1856
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
and it was $30 times two

1857
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
it's like yeah you can pay for this

1858
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
or you can play it for free now

1859
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
yeah Ping Pals wasn't even online

1860
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
it had these avatars

1861
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I guess there was some type of game

1862
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
you may remember Rob

1863
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
that when the DS came out

1864
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
they didn't have online

1865
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
that's right

1866
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
it was like that hidden thing

1867
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Nintendo always puts that magical

1868
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
thing in their new system

1869
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
they'll tell you later, gotcha

1870
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
it was in there the whole time

1871
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
there's always something like that

1872
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
seriously, with the DS it was the internet

1873
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
secretly it was there the whole time

1874
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
the Wii has some slumbering

1875
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
stuff like that too, the channels

1876
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
that they come out with

1877
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
so since the buying public

1878
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
is used to it, Microsoft's gonna

1879
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
pick up a shovel and Sony's gonna pick up

1880
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
a shovel and just start shoveling

1881
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
games our way

1882
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
well here's what I'm saying

1883
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I understand that

1884
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
the Wii has the advantage of the price

1885
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
point because it's $150

1886
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
now

1887
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
and they do have the

1888
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
disadvantage that they're getting

1889
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
you have to buy the extra sensor

1890
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
if you wanna play those games

1891
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
um

1892
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
but I mean once again it's all about

1893
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
perception because yeah, Wii costs

1894
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
you know, $150 but

1895
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
let's say if you're playing, you know, setting it up

1896
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
for a family of four, it's gonna

1897
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
cost a lot more to do that with the Wii

1898
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
than it would be on the Xbox 360

1899
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I mean

1900
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
even though you may, you know, it may seem

1901
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
that the Wii's a better choice with all the extra

1902
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
added crap to it, it's gonna

1903
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
add up and

1904
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
with Sony it's the same thing, you're gonna have to

1905
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
buy all these different accessories, now I know you

1906
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
don't have to buy all these accessories if you

1907
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
wanna play by yourself, that's fine

1908
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
or if you wanna play with just one other person

1909
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
you know, then you can save yourself a little bit

1910
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
of money but at least with the Kinect

1911
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
it'll support up to as many players

1912
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
as the game will support

1913
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
alright, before we get to Jamie's next

1914
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
story and then the release dates here, I've gotta read this

1915
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
real quick because this was linked to us in chat by Robocoon

1916
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
linked us to the official Ping Pals

1917
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Wikipedia article and I've gotta read this

1918
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
excerpt cause it's gold, ready?

1919
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Keep in mind this is Wikipedia

1920
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Ping Pals was released on December 8th

1921
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
2004, although it was marketed

1922
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
as a non-violent, girl-friendly game

1923
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
it was frequently criticized as not

1924
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
being interactive enough to be called a game

1925
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
in addition to this, the DS has a

1926
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
built-in chat program called PictoChat

1927
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
PictoChat includes features that

1928
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Ping Pals lacks and due to this, the game

1929
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
received poor ratings, for instance

1930
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Nintendo Official Magazine gave

1931
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
it 9% in its Nintendo

1932
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
DS special with the opening

1933
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
sentence saying, with PictoChat

1934
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
coming as standard, this is

1935
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
a bit like paying money to breathe air

1936
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
the reviewer

1937
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
gave a one-word written summary reading

1938
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
pointless

1939
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
uh, let's see, uh, Electronic

1940
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Gaming Monthly gave the game an average of

1941
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
.5 out of 10

1942
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
with the game receiving two zeroes and

1943
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
one 1.5

1944
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
it was really shiny, girl-friendly air

1945
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
that's my favorite, girl-friendly

1946
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
ha ha ha

1947
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
yeah, that's why I had to buy two

1948
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
copies, I love it, maybe even a brain-dead

1949
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
vegetable hooked up to life support girl-friendly

1950
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
the GM, GMR magazine

1951
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
gave it a 0 out of 10

1952
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
it's below their normal scale

1953
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
nice, alright, Dar Sakura

1954
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
what do you have for us, do you have a girl-friendly story for us?

1955
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I have something that makes me happy, okay

1956
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Facebook games are going poop

1957
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
um, and keep

1958
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
in mind the only thing that I play is Hotel City

1959
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
good, I'm a fan of not playing Farmville

1960
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
yeah, I hate Farmville

1961
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Farmville is like the poop

1962
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
that dung beetles poop

1963
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Farmville's free on the iPhone

1964
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
right now, you know

1965
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
they'd have to pay me, at any rate

1966
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
my friends are now playing Frontierville

1967
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Gamasutra, um

1968
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
keeps up with, you know, who's

1969
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
playing what on Facebook games

1970
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
and, um, basically

1971
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
uh, the

1972
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
the big Zynga games have gone down

1973
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
um, Farmville went from

1974
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
66.6 million, ooh, evil

1975
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
to 63.9 million

1976
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Treasure Isle dropped 2.5

1977
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
million, and Cafe World lost 1.5

1978
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
million, um, the only

1979
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
thing there that's really keeping it

1980
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
steady is, uh

1981
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
well, that's attracted new players is

1982
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Texas Hold'em Poker

1983
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
they got 28.6 million players

1984
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
you gotta wonder how many of those are actual people

1985
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I, you know

1986
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I hate the stupid games

1987
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I think people are finally starting to go

1988
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
I'm wasting my time

1989
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I could do something

1990
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
have you ever heard the music in Farmville?

1991
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
oh, they made new ones

1992
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
what?

1993
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
oh god, when I played Farmville, nevermind

1994
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
when I used to play Farmville

1995
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
the theme song was so horrible, it was this

1996
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
one thing that would loop over and over

1997
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
and over again, I guess now

1998
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I tried it once

1999
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
and then I was like

2000
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
ugh, why

2001
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
and like, it's not even why is a question

2002
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
it's why is a statement

2003
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
like, if I was typing it

2004
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
it would be, it would have no capitalization

2005
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
and have a period at the end

2006
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
it would just be why

2007
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
or what

2008
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
what

2009
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
yeah, it would be a statement, it wouldn't even

2010
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
require grammar

2011
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
but see, here's the thing

2012
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I'm actually really looking forward to the Civilization

2013
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Facebook game

2014
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
like, there's some really cool sounding stuff around the corner

2015
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
you're a civ nerd

2016
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I really am

2017
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
go by civ

2018
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
like 7-Elevenville

2019
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't think I'll play 7-Elevenville

2020
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
but no, I would go into 7-Elevenville

2021
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
that's not a joke, is it?

2022
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Zanga Zanga Zanga Zanga

2023
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
whatever has really taken over 7-Eleven

2024
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
it's kind of disgusting

2025
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
what kind of Slurpees do they have?

2026
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I didn't even look

2027
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
at the Iron Man stuff

2028
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
did you see what was in my kitchen?

2029
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I have a War Machine Slurpee cup

2030
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't even drink Slurpees

2031
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
and I got a War Machine cup because I'm gonna repaint it

2032
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
what's great though is some of the Farmville parodies

2033
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I gotta say, because there's one called Farmvillain

2034
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
that's great

2035
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
that I guess, like Robocoon is saying

2036
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
you can now collect horse semen on your farm

2037
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
like, there's, you know, horrible things that happen there

2038
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Rama says in our chat room

2039
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
and this is why I play Pot Farm

2040
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
that's gonna be a reality

2041
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
in California after November

2042
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I don't know if you heard

2043
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
it's qualifying for the ballot

2044
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
do you want to smoke weed?

2045
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
yes or no, in a nutshell

2046
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
oh god, what is my anti-nausea medication

2047
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
it'll pass

2048
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
well, not even a question

2049
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
it's gonna pass

2050
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I'm glad you asked, because it's coming in November

2051
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
no, no, no, no

2052
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
the anti-nausea medication FROM

2053
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
all that

2054
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
yeah, but that actually is good for anti-nausea

2055
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
they're actually allergic to it, but then again some people also allergic to cigarette smoke

2056
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
dude, California's gonna be the only place

2057
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
where you can go to Taco Bell

2058
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
and get a number one that comes with a quesadilla

2059
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
two crispy tacos

2060
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
a gordita

2061
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
and BUD

2062
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
and a joint

2063
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
we're gonna be

2064
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Amsterdam the sequel

2065
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
oh my god, it's a good time to stay indoors

2066
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
just need the hookers now

2067
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
here's the thing

2068
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
for like 60 days

2069
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
ahh, it's too far away

2070
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
for 60 days, it's gonna be the most

2071
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
lolsy thing you could ever imagine

2072
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
everybody will be

2073
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
eye for like 60 days

2074
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
not everybody, I don't smoke pot

2075
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
California stood still

2076
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
there's gonna be so many people

2077
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
just like, it's 4.20 every day

2078
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and then, you know what

2079
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
it's gonna, ok, alright

2080
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
it's like when prohibition was eliminated

2081
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, pass out, wake up

2082
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
ok, we're over

2083
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm gonna get political for a second, Rob, may I?

2084
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
oh hell why not

2085
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
disclaimer, ok, let's go ahead

2086
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
and look back at history, and this is why

2087
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
this whole stupid war on drugs thing is

2088
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
pretty much bullshit

2089
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
when they made booze

2090
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
illegal, what happened?

2091
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
an increase in crime

2092
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
we had the heyday of the

2093
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
old school gangster

2094
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
you know, but Dick Tracy was here

2095
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
to make it all better

2096
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
but my point is

2097
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
that when you made booze illegal

2098
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
crime went up

2099
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
now, and this is actually

2100
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
the best way I can paraphrase it

2101
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
ok, there was a Bloom County strip

2102
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
a while back, you know where Opus the Penguin came from

2103
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
and

2104
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
he and Oliver Wendell

2105
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Jones

2106
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
were selling

2107
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
hair growing tonic made from cat sweat

2108
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and

2109
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
the moment it became illegal, their prices

2110
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
shot up, so they could charge more

2111
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
for it, and then they were having people

2112
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
you know, run guns and everything

2113
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
and another one actually in the same comic

2114
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
is when

2115
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Opus and Bill were running for president

2116
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
and the drug traffickers came up and said

2117
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
we hope you'll have tough gun laws, that makes

2118
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
more profit for us

2119
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I mean, I know that that's

2120
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
you know

2121
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
a parody, you know, just a little political

2122
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
commentary on it, but

2123
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
the numbers are there

2124
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
you know, gun free zones

2125
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
have a higher

2126
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
rate of gun related deaths

2127
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
than

2128
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
you know, places where it's legal to

2129
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
carry a firearm

2130
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
criminals don't really care if it's legal or not

2131
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
no, but they're less likely

2132
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
to use it when the other person might be armed too

2133
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I feel like Jamie should have a theme song when she's giving

2134
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
history lessons here on the show

2135
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
so do you want to continue with your history lesson

2136
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
yes I do

2137
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
I'll play a little bit of

2138
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
God Save the Queen here

2139
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
anyway

2140
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
but I'm saying

2141
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I'm going to completely second what you said

2142
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Rob, the moment that the

2143
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
pot loss pass

2144
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
you're going to have a month where people are going to go

2145
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
ahhhhh

2146
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
and all of the right wing nut jobs

2147
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
are going to go, ah see we told you

2148
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
and then

2149
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
a month later, two months later

2150
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
it'll be nothing, no one will care

2151
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
you mean I can go outside?

2152
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
yes, it's safe

2153
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
you mean I actually do go outside?

2154
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
um, it's safe

2155
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
but you know what this means

2156
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
there will come a day

2157
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
the Orange Lounge radio episode where we're all

2158
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
high as fuck

2159
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
and that will be just another episode

2160
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
where I'm in the chat room

2161
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
yeah, me too, it'll sound like every other episode

2162
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
yeah, I'm allergic to pot too

2163
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
but my whole point

2164
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
my whole point, and this is the

2165
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
biggest thing with, in fact

2166
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I've been listening to a lot of

2167
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
history podcasts and maybe I'll plug

2168
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
them later, but

2169
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
the biggest thing for anyone

2170
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
if you want to look at what's going on in business

2171
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
right now, if you want to look at what's going on

2172
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
in politics right now

2173
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
if you want to see, is A or

2174
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
B going to work, look

2175
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
to about a hundred

2176
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
to eighty years ago

2177
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
and

2178
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
you know, then tell me, will it work?

2179
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
well I think

2180
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
oh, it's the same idea, it's the same idea

2181
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I think in this year, 2010

2182
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
the question is not, will it work

2183
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
but will it blend

2184
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
alright

2185
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
but, okay, thank you for letting me rant

2186
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
you're welcome

2187
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
just the biggest thing is that

2188
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
if you want to see if something's going to work now

2189
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
look to the past

2190
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Frisbee in our chat room says, OLR with weed

2191
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
is Orange Lounge foodie-o, like I said

2192
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
just like every other week

2193
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
have you ever done OLR

2194
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
on weed?

2195
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
you boys like Mexico?

2196
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
and by the way

2197
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
one last little political

2198
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
snipe, if you

2199
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
want to see what

2200
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
for all the advocates that were

2201
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
voting for unregulated business

2202
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
look back to

2203
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Carnegie and to

2204
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Rockefeller and see how well

2205
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
people fared when they were in control

2206
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
of unregulated business

2207
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
including moderation

2208
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
alright, yes, moderate moderation

2209
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
alright, that's redundant

2210
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
alright, let's

2211
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
thank you for calling the department

2212
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
your redundancy is repetitive

2213
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
alright, let's move on

2214
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
release dates

2215
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
weed is coming out November 4th

2216
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
just kidding

2217
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
alright, what's coming out in the US

2218
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
you know that's kind of odd

2219
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
it's timed right with the connect

2220
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
connect

2221
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
works off weed

2222
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
anyways, there's

2223
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
lots of stuff actually coming out this week

2224
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
pretty decent release week which is good because

2225
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
next week there's not a whole lot

2226
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
so this week we've got

2227
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Sin and Punishment start successor

2228
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
actually it's not this week, that's today

2229
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
so you've missed out on it already

2230
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
possibly

2231
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
and you wasted your whole day watching the Mario

2232
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
marathon and you could have been playing Sin and Punishment

2233
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Sin and Punishment, at least it's a good cause

2234
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Death Smiles

2235
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
limited edition, making its way out to the

2236
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Xbox 360 this week

2237
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
a pretty awesome shmup game, definitely worth

2238
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
picking up, and plus you get a nice little

2239
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
face plate for your Xbox 360

2240
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
and the soundtrack, so

2241
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
sounds like a good deal

2242
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Think Smart on Nintendo DS, yet another brain

2243
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
training game

2244
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Lego Harry Potter on the

2245
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Playstation 3, Xbox 360

2246
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Wii, DS, and PSP

2247
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
and probably the PC as well

2248
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
A 10 Minute Solutions from

2249
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Activision, it's a fitness game

2250
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
based off, I guess, a DVD series

2251
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
99 Nights 2

2252
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
now with more nights

2253
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Coming to Xbox 360

2254
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
99 Nights 2, night harder

2255
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
99 Nights 2, Electric Boogaloo

2256
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Singularity

2257
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

2258
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
and PC

2259
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
might call that Time Shift 2

2260
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
The

2261
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Last Airbender, the game

2262
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
based off the movie, based off the

2263
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
anime, based off

2264
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
another game, no

2265
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
that's on DS and Wii

2266
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I'm sure it's going to be so much better than the

2267
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
you know, the ones based

2268
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
off the animated series

2269
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
the twist is not

2270
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Sniper Ghost Warrior

2271
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
on PC and Xbox 360

2272
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Sniper Ghost Warrior?

2273
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yes

2274
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Sniper Ghost Warrior

2275
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
It's not like a sci-fi movie

2276
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
starring, you know, Debbie Gibson

2277
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I'm sorry, Deborah Gibson and Tiffany

2278
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
They're like ghosts because they hide

2279
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
in the shadows and snipe you in the head

2280
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I gotta start that tangent again

2281
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
about why they need to make games out of sci-fi movies

2282
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
because did you hear the one this week about

2283
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Debbie Gibson and Tiffany being in a movie?

2284
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Together?

2285
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I saw that article and I was just like

2286
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I don't care

2287
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
You know what though? I do agree

2288
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
with you because cheesy games do

2289
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
end up being

2290
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
pretty cool, which is why

2291
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
once again I must

2292
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
urge you D3

2293
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
publishing, bring over the

2294
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
simple series. Come on

2295
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
you know you wanna

2296
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
and I know Oni Chumbara didn't really do that well

2297
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
over here, but Earth Defense Force 2017

2298
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
is so awesome! All you need to do

2299
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
is remake the second game. I know the

2300
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
second game was almost the first game

2301
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
all over again and the third game was basically the

2302
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
first game all over again, but

2303
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
it's, you don't really need to do anything

2304
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
all you need to do is put more levels

2305
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
and they only have to be that different

2306
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
just more levels, completely forget

2307
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
the last games existed, add a few different

2308
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
enemy types, I think you should make a

2309
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
level editor in there, and four player co-op

2310
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and four player system link

2311
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
or four player over live

2312
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Speaking of gold

2313
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
speaking of Ludacris, you might like this Logie

2314
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I was listening to Bobby's show on the way over here

2315
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
in the car, on the handy dandy all games

2316
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
iPhone app, and he was

2317
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
talking about risk factions, and I'm kind of

2318
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
paraphrasing here because I haven't played the game myself

2319
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
but he did, but he was talking about

2320
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
how, you know, there's classic risk in there

2321
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
where you can play as all the different countries and dah dah dah dah

2322
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
but in one of the new modes, like a story mode

2323
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
or whatever, like the different factions are like

2324
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
humans, zombies

2325
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
and cats

2326
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
and robots

2327
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I'm like, this sounds awesome!

2328
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
So, you can

2329
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
lead an army of cats against an army

2330
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
of zombies. Amazing!

2331
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So we need more cheesy games

2332
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
like, uh, Tachyon

2333
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
starring Bruce Campbell. President cat, hello

2334
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
whatever happened with that, don't think I even forgot

2335
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I mean, look at the symbol series over in Japan

2336
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
on the Playstation 2, they've released

2337
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
like a good 50 games

2338
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
at least, in that series

2339
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
you know, for like 20 bucks

2340
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
they just take these really weird, independent

2341
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
games, I guess, and then throw them out there

2342
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I mean, they have one with

2343
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
versus with, you know, miniguns

2344
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
you know, mowing down zombies

2345
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
they have zombies versus ambulance

2346
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
you drive an ambulance and you run over

2347
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
zombies, it's awesome

2348
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
and then, you know, there's actually a lot of games

2349
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
with zombies now that I think of it

2350
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
for the simple series, because there's only

2351
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Chambara, which is basically you fighting zombies

2352
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
with a samurai sword and a chick wearing a bikini and a cowboy hat

2353
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
but Earth Defense Force

2354
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
is so awesome though

2355
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
it's an incredible game

2356
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
and I really want to go back and play the Playstation 2

2357
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
version of Earth Defense Force 2

2358
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
because they have like a chick with a jet pack

2359
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
you can fly around as

2360
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
they have these different

2361
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
different looking characters

2362
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I mean, they're the same

2363
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
they have the robot types and the UFOs and stuff like that

2364
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
but the one robot type in there

2365
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
kind of looks like a tripod from War of the Worlds

2366
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
and that's really cool!

2367
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
and it's just, the whole point is cheesy stuff

2368
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
even like, you know

2369
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Zombies Ate My Neighbors

2370
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
a perfect example of how you can make a game that's cheesy

2371
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
that parodies a bunch of like, you know

2372
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
old sci-fi horror movies

2373
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I think it's a great idea

2374
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
but anyways, we're getting on a tangent here

2375
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
so

2376
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
O.S. we do!

2377
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
More stuff coming up this week

2378
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Fallen Earth Blood Sports on PC

2379
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Kind of wonder, what sports

2380
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
are they playing in Fallen Earth?

2381
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I don't know

2382
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It doesn't say

2383
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I think it's an expansion

2384
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Uninterested

2385
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Missed on DS

2386
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I'm guessing that must be re-released

2387
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
because I could have sworn that's been released before

2388
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
or maybe it's a different publisher now

2389
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
but if you haven't picked that up

2390
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
you can pick it up now

2391
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
play a game that's really, really old

2392
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Let's see

2393
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
What other fun stuff do we have here?

2394
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Oh yeah, Just Sing

2395
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
with microphone for the DS

2396
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
so you can sing karaoke

2397
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
on your DS

2398
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Not quite

2399
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Different company

2400
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
I wonder if you can sing

2401
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Brew

2402
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Naughty Bear

2403
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
on Playstation 3

2404
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
There's a lot of those in San Francisco

2405
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Did you see the trailer for that?

2406
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That looks like fun!

2407
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
No, I haven't seen it

2408
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I'll YouTube it right now

2409
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
It's like Hitman with teddy bears

2410
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
You're trying to get revenge on all the other teddy bears

2411
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
in the village

2412
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
and the whole point is to be as evil as possible

2413
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
you have an evil meter

2414
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
or a naughty meter

2415
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
and you can kill them but you get more points

2416
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
for torturing them and being witnessed

2417
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
torturing them

2418
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So it's Overlord with teddy bears

2419
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
It's beautiful

2420
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
It's horrible and beautiful at the same time

2421
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I love it

2422
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Oh wait, this is an ad

2423
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
fucking YouTube, hold on

2424
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Crackdown 2

2425
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
is an excellent game that will be coming out next week

2426
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
on the 6th

2427
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I want Naughty Bear

2428
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
But it's way better than Naughty Bear, sadly

2429
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Naughty Bear though, you can set traps for them

2430
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Do you know how much fucking traffic

2431
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
those naughty bears caused in San Francisco today?

2432
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I had to go around

2433
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Oh, here we go

2434
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
360

2435
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Shut up

2436
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
This is quality radio ladies and gentlemen

2437
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
