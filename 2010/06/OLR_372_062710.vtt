00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Tonight June 27th, 2010, Xbox Live might stop Final Fantasy 14 from showing up on 360

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
A classic PC game show is set to come back, and are people leaving their Facebook games?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
You know what, it is that show, as we say, where every gamer has a voice

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
And joining me over the next three hours, say hello, oh my name is Rob Roberts in case you didn't know

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Joining me over the next few hours, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
How are you?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Happy birthday

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yay

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Happy birthday

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
We're old

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yay

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hi

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Happy birthday

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
It's not my birthday

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Well it's the show's birthday

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Oh

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Orange Lounge Radio turned eight years old this week on June 23rd, was our first show

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
So there you go

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
That's why I'm saying happy birthday to everybody

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Now I did have an actual birthday yesterday, but we don't talk about that because I really am old

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm four times the age of the show

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Who's older than you in this room?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Um

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Me

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
So shut up

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and introduce tonight a special guest we have here in studio

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
A very special, I almost said spatial guest because he takes up space, as he usually does here on this show

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
We always give him a hard time

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
He takes up less space than each of us

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Actually yes, he's actually a skinny motherfucker, I hate him for it, but that's okay

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Say hello, he has not been here in probably what, like four years or something?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
It's been a long time

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
About a year

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
About a year, I don't know

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Last time you were here we were at the other studio

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
By the way, say hello

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
No further ado, the 23rd Magus, also known as Drewnami

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Do you have a new name now?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Drewnami

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Drewnami still, okay

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Because I know back in the day you were 23rd Magus for about the first three years of the show

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Then you were Drewnami for about another, you know, I guess till now

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm not due for another handle change anytime soon

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Okay, just checking

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
So how are you?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, I heard you guys kind of missed me, so here I am

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Well

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
And now you're in targeting range

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Our aim consistently improves

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
Actually, it's kind of funny because you have something in common with Orange Lounge Radio, don't you?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes, I share a birthday with you guys

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
So happy birthday to you as well

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
And has a toilet paper joke book

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, there's all these little in-jokes that go with Drewnami

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Because you used to come to the show a lot back in the heyday

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
You know, we all play DDR and all those, you know, arrow stomping and arm waving

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And button mashing and all those fun music games we used to play back in the day

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
But I gotta say, I don't know if you heard, but there's like more than 12 people listening to Orange Lounge Radio now

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
It's really

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
No!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I know, right?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Like, who would have thought, right?

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
So, catch up some of the people who've never heard you on this program before

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
What kind of games do you play?

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
What are you into and why are you here on this show?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Well, I'm still kind of the big Bimani buff

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
Although that's kind of waned a bit in the past couple of years since, you know, the genre's kind of waned

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
I'm the RPG, the MMO buff

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
If it's Square, if it's BioWare, I've probably played it

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I just play a very diverse set of games

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
You must be looking very much forward to that new Star Wars game that's by BioWare

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
It's like, it's an MMO

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
The Old Republic?

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
The new one, what's the new one? Oh, I can't even remember

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Star Wars The Old Republic

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Is it? Okay

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
A lot of people say it's gonna be a WoW killer

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Me, as the kind of WoW addict, I say no

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Why does there have to be a WoW killer?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I mean, yes, I realize 11 million people are subscribed to WoW

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
But, you know, there's a lot more people on the planet, you know what I mean?

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
Like, I don't think WoW is gonna die by the hands of one game

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
It may die by the hands of itself one day?

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Well, I'll get into that later because I'm really, really mad at WoW this week

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Really mad

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
The Roman Empire was responsible for its own destruction

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And who hears about EverQuest anymore?

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
There's gonna come a day where WoW is gonna have to go through a major overhaul

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
To kind of catch up, or, you know, to stay current

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And, you know, sometimes these overhauls are not received very well

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
But I don't know, I mean, I don't want to get too far off topic

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Because it's too much crystal ball and, you know

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, a lot of people just don't juggle multiple MMOs

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And I think the market's sort of reaching saturation if you ask me

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangelaundraidio.com

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
And look at some comments as you folks chat live with us

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
www.allgames.com

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, he's on at about 5 Pacific

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
We're on at about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
But, you know, sometimes we run late, you know, it's just a deal

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
Alright, but we're here taping live, so please, if you're listening live to us on All Games

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Join our chat room at chat.orangelaundraidio.com

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Okay, Ziba in our chat room says

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Every new MMO is said to be the WoW killer

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Remember when Warhammer Online was gonna be the WoW killer?

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Remember when Ion was gonna be the WoW killer?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Remember when Eve was supposed to be the WoW killer?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Well, Eve still has a pretty strong cult following

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah, but it's still very niche

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Star Trek Online

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
I was gonna say, here we have Jamie and her thing is Star Trek Online

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
And it was Ragnarok

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
And I think Star Trek Online is a good example

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Does it have as many people as WoW? No

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
But is it probably doing successful for itself? Sure

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
It's probably making money, you know, it's so

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Probably, I doubt Star Trek Online took all these people away from WoW

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
I think it kind of carved itself to a new audience that maybe wasn't playing WoW before

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Like Jamie, Jamie quit WoW before STO was out

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Well, it just seems to me that WoW is sort of like

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
Remember when we discussed Guitar Hero versus say Beatmania?

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
How it was, it brought accessibility to the genre, brought it into the mainstream

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Oh yeah

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
A lot of MMOs are kind of following the WoW formula, so to speak, or incorporating

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And vice versa

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
There were so many people when Guitar Hero first came out, especially the group listening to this show

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
That grew up on the Bomani Games that were like

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Freaking ripoff of Guitar Freaks

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
This is just a stupid ripoff

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
And Guitar Freaks is better

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
And the music's better

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And Guitar Freaks, well, okay

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
And then when Beatmania US finally came out

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Reviews called it a ripoff of Guitar Hero

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Well that was ignorant

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
I mean, that was just straight up written by an intern

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Ignorant intern that should never

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Ignant

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Ignant intern that should never

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
That's an insult to interns everywhere

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm digress, sorry

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Sorry Do Not Me, but you know

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
But I digress

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
The thing is that Guitar Hero, you hit the nail on the head

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Succeeded where Guitar Freaks failed because

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
Harmonix, who was the developer at the time, took a risk

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
A huge risk and made it accessible

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
Konami, too stubborn to take risks

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
And I still say that's the case with them to an extent today

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Too stubborn to take risks

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Anyhow

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Wow, fun show already

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
We haven't gotten into the news

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Let's start off with How Was Your Gaming Week?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
We always like to talk about the games we've been playing

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Ladies first, Dark Soccer, How Was Your Gaming Week?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Well, it was

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I don't know, it actually wasn't too bad

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Because I have a DSI now

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
I will not say how we acquired such a thing

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Huzzah!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
You stole it

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Killed a hobo

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Killed a hobo, exactly

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
So, I've actually started back into The World Is Not Enough

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
It's a cool game

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Awesome game

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Oh yeah, I've heard a lot of neat things about that

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I haven't spent a lot of time with that myself

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Wait, The World Is Not Enough, that was a Bond movie

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
The World Ends With You

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
The World Ends With You

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Because, well, I'll tell you what my brain did

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Okay, here's an insight into how my brain works

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I said The World Is Not Enough, then my brain went

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
That's not right, because that spells out twine

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What game?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
What?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
I just think of the garbage song

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
That's how my mind works

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I think of the song from the James Bond movie

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
The World Is Not Enough, T-W-I-N-E

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, I get it, T-wine

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
So I was like, I was like twine

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Like the biggest ball of twine in, no that wasn't it

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
That's how my brain, that's the cycle that my brain went through

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
T-Pain's younger sister, T-wine

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
And then that's when I realized I was playing Sam and Max

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
And that's when I realized

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
The World Ends With You

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
And that's when I realized Joshua is still an asshole

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
And I started actually trying to play Oh And On again

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Which spells out T-weh

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
So, also we've been watching the Mario marathon

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Because that's super awesome

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
And I've also been sending Dan YouTube videos of this guy

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Playing a bunch of brass instruments

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
You know, re-recording himself

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Doing like the Mario 64 theme

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
And playing the euphonium

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Which is one of my favorite instruments

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I just like to say it, euphonium

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That's really about, oh yeah yeah yeah

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I played some Portal

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I lusted over Portal 2 some more

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
And um, oh yeah lots

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
I love your description

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
I lusted over Portal 2

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And I played a crap

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You sound like you're watching YouTube

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And your tongue is on the floor

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That's not what you do when you lust Rob

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
So pretty

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Anyway, and I played a crap ton of Star Trek Online

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I played enough Star Trek Online in two days

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
To get from Commander 2 to Commander 7

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
So, because you have ten ranks in each rank

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
So I'm three ranks away from Captain

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Mini ranks

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
Yeah, I said you have degrees of your rank

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
So I am now at Commander level 7

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
And I will be probably Captain before my surgery

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
My goal is to get to Captain before I go out for surgery

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Let's talk about your surgery for a minute

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Because it's going to impact the show coming up

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Oh shit, that's right

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Well we don't have to, you know

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
No we can tell, it was fine

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Well you're going to be having surgery, what?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
On the hand again, right?

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Yes, I will be a little technical here

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I have trigger finger

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It's also called flexor tendinitis

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I have it in my middle two fingers on my right hand

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
And if you want to really know what the surgery goes into

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Just look it up online

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I'll post something in the chatroom and gross everybody out

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
But I was awake during my last one

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
And I don't really care about my new one

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Because I'll be awake through that too

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
I'm just glad I get my benefits

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
No, insurance, seriously

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Healthcare is the big hot issue here

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
And thankfully I'll be on FMLA during the layoffs at my company

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
So I will still have employment at my old company

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And still have benefits

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
And then I get laid off

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Work that system, work it

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
And then I get laid off

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Aww, wah wah wah

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Hire me, I'm a designer

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
So the whole thing about this though

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
Is that basically they're going to fly my hand at the palm

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
And cut the tendon sheaths around the middle two fingers

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And then leave it open

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Because what's going to happen is there's a big knot in there

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And it's going to grow over the knotting

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
So that the swelling will go down

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
And as a result I won't be able to use my right hand for at least a week

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And it'll be replaced by a monkey paw

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
No

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Although actually a chimpanzee would be cool

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
She really will be Jamie Summers

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Because they're going to give her a bionic arm

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I want a bionic hand

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Will you be able to go go go gadget finger?

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
Is his middle finger the water pistol one?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Yes

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Damn it Rob, you stole my joke

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
But no, so I'm going to go in and have my hand flayed open

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
By a specialist

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Ooh

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
And I will

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
They have specialists that flay hands?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Yes they do

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I want to be that specialist

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
So I will be here for the show

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I just will be very slow with

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
You know, probably will not be hanging out in the chat room

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Or I might be in the chat room just, you know, ghosting

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Slamming down random keys

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
And the best thing about it is Vicodin

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
It'll sound like a Zaku call

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
When he doesn't stop typing on the keyboard

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Thump thump thump thump thump thump thump

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
No

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Jamie's slamming her monkey paw down on the keyboard

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
She's communicating

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
One thump means she's angry

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
What I want is chimp fingers

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Or like orangutan fingers, the really long ones

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
That I can grab things and poke holes in fruit

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
But the best part is drugs

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
That's always the best part of a surgery

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I will be on, probably on Vicodin

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
They don't really care if you hurt or not

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
They just want you to not care that you hurt

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Be sure to play tons of video games while you're on drugs

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Okay get this

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Last time I had my surgery, do you know what I was doing two days later?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Playing Blue Dragon

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
All night

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Did you think the game was good?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I love Blue Dragon

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It's like playing a Dreamcast game

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Hey

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I liked it because it was like playing a Dreamcast game

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Okay

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
By the way, I also cleaned out a closet today

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
In this preparation for not being able to do any housework

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And I found my Dreamcast shirt

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
And a crap ton of stuff that I'm sending to our buddy Rob in England

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Well isn't that nice of you

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Yes

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Alright so no show July 4th

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
He sends me dirty cards every year

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
No show July 4th because that is the day that America celebrates fire

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
So we're

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I mean that's a very important holiday to us

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
If you're having a block party for my neighborhood on the 3rd

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
So you totally have to come

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Oh we just might actually

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
So we got that going on

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
But then come July 11th

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Orange Lounge Radio will be back

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
You said it

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
And it'll be something like this when Orange Lounge Radio is back on the 11th

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Orange Lounge Radio starring

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Rob Roberts

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And featuring

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
No no no no

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
See Rob

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
You have to do the right thing

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
You have to play the bionic level

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
And you know that's

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Seriously what I got my name after

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
No I know

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
You know

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
I want to

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Be all bionic and have the little

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
String quartet follow me around every time I run

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Cause you know

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
They always play that string music whenever

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
She starts running

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Cause the bionic man gets the

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
sound you know

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I want the string quartet to follow me

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Since it'll be my hand they have to play when I type

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Alright

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Spyro's in our chat room saying

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Even though I'm British I still celebrate the 4th

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Stick it to the king

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
No that's kind of like feeding

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
a cow a hamburger but okay

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Alright

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Double the beef why

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
You know that's what caused mad cow disease

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I bet alright look

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Occasionally on this program

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
We talk about video games. Loki how was your

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Gaming week?

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It was okay I actually played some different

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Stuff this week because I am being

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Forced to

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Sit on a jury

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh crap did you get picked?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I got picked

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Jokes on them

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Actually

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Alright we're going to ask you all about

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
The case when it's done it's still going right?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Yeah

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Okay so I know you can't talk about it cause but

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Well I can't but

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Actually

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
You want to get dismissed real quick here's your

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Form

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
That's not dismissed that's contempt

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
When they're doing the interview she'll go

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I support killing them

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
But it wouldn't be

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
That's okay cause Inspector Gadget can get you out of jail

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
It wouldn't be so bad if it was like

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
You know a criminal

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Trial but no it's a civil

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Trial you know in other words somebody

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Is mad and so they're suing for

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Money and that's

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
What's going it

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I kid you not I couldn't roll

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
My eyes more than at this

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Trial and on top of that

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
The prosecution lawyer is an idiot

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Who talks like Andy Griffith

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And it's hilarious

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
So is the case anything like this

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
When you're in the courtroom like you know

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
You'll just kind of be sitting there and then you know

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Now the

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Prosecution is going to call a witness to the stand

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
No it's not even that dramatic

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
It's like

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Okay I kid you not we're not supposed to talk about

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
The case but we're going to talk about like this

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Cause it doesn't really

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
No no no no listen it doesn't really talk

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
About the case at all they spent

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
An hour and a half discussing the

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Difference between a phone

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
A speaker phone

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And a loudspeaker

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
PA system because they were

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Confused or I should say

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
The prosecution lawyer was

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Confused and we were

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Falling asleep we went

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Then we finally had our afternoon break we all

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Walked out into the you know

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Hallway and just kind of looked at each other and

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Shook our heads like this is going to last

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Until November

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Great you got the lawyer who watched

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Too much Matlock

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh my god the guy is like it's

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Seriously Andy Griffith

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
He introduced

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
He introduced himself as

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Okay I'm going to screw up people's

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Names I'm going to forget things

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm going to repeat stuff I'm going

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
To um get

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Confused but don't hold that against

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
My client I'm like how much

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Did you pay for this guy

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Hey at least he's modest Tigerclaw wants

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
To know court appointed Tigerclaw in our chat

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Room wants to know if the case is a little more like

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Night court

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I'd say it's more

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Night court than law and order

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Oh god look out for bull

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Great

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
So we got inspector gadget we got

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Night court I don't know I

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Dread what might be coming for me but that's alright

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Anyways so because I've had to

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Endure um

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Court

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I've been playing a lot of stuff on my DS

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Including peggle knights

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Which is

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Pretty fun and of course

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Um some

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Planet puzzle league

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
And I actually played a little bit

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Of grand theft auto

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Chinatown wars

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
But I got to say man

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Chinatown wars I just don't

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Dig the 2D

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Well not really 2D

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
The top down old school grand theft auto

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Stuff I mean once you've been spoiled by

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Number 3 and beyond

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
Just why go back

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I will admit I don't think I ever played more

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
DS than when I had um

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Jury duty so I feel ya

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And it's just so

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Terrible cause like I have to go there

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
At like 7 in the morning

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
To get a parking spot because

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Our jury is

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Our jury parking lot's in downtown

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Sacramento where there's

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
No parking because they're

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Dick holes that don't you know

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Provide adequate parking for the jury

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
So you have to get there that early in order to get

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Parking and then our trial

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Doesn't actually start until 9 AM

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
So I'm sitting there just bored

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Out of my mind um

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
For 2 hours

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
They waste so much time it's just ridiculous

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
But um in fact

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
We were off Thursday

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Friday and Monday of next week

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Because our judge is on vacation

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Thank you for taking

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
The case right before you go on vacation

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
That's awesome

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Um okay but anyways

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Other than that um I've been playing

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
More Grand Theft Auto of course um

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I made

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Back I guess um

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
The ranks that I

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Lost from playing some sloppy

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Games um I've been taking it

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Out on my co-workers so I've been beating the

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Crap out of them very

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Viciously uh quadrupling

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Their scores at times um

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
And then um

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
What else

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Earth Defense Force 2017

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Because that game is still fun uh finished

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Uh the

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Uh the hardest

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Difficulty on that so it was fun so we're going backwards

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Now playing around with the genocide gun

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And then uh I actually played a little bit

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Of the Crackdown 2 demo hopefully

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
Gonna be playing the full game

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
By the end of this week I just have to convince them

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
To give me my copy because they've been sitting

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
On it for 2 weeks um

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
But yeah it's pretty fun

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And Crackdown 2 uh pretty much just like

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
You remember the first one it's kind of cool

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
If you've actually played the first game you'll recognize

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
A lot of the stuff in the game a lot of the

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Locations are very similar if not

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
The same in fact I was just kind of

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Walking around going wow hey I reckon

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Oh my god I wonder if this is here from the first

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Game oh yeah it is there it is um

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
So that's kind of fun and the game itself

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You know pretty cool

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
So I can't wait to pick that up and actually play

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Some maybe uh co-op online and what not

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Um

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
But yeah that's pretty much it for right now

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Uh let's see my

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Gaming week then if we move on to me um

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Not a whole lot of new stuff

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I'm still making my way through Alan Wake

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
One of these days I'll beat it um

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
But I did spend quite a bit of time on wow this

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Week you know addict uh which I'll

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Come back to in a minute um I also um

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Play a little bit of game room cause you know I love

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Me some classic games and one of my all time

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Favorite classic games came out on

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Game room this week H E R

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
O from the Atari 2600 now

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I played this a little more on the Commodore 64

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
With the slightly better graphics but you know it's still

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
The same game I remember in a nutshell

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Uh the H E R O it's it's

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Helicopter rescue operation basically

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Um and you play this little guy

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That has a helicopter on his back and it's

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
This cute little control mechanism and you kind of

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Explore caves but in

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
The cave there are monsters and lava

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And all these things you have to avoid and

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Sometimes boats that you take actually

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
For 2600 game it was pretty

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Darn impressive I mean they really

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Packed a lot into the cartridge

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Um I would kind of compare it to like

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Imagine like if you could fly around in pitfall

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It's kind of like that cause you know pitfall was an

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Activision game too but it was one of my favorite games

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Uh that came out for the 2600 but it came out right

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Before the big crash so I think a lot of people

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Missed this game but it's on game room now and you know

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It's it's worth at least checking out the demo

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And see if you like it um

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm I tried to get a top 20 score but

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I found it was it was

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Very scary how much I remembered like

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Go down through the left tunnel instead

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Of the right tunnel or go down the third passage

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Like I actually remembered how to get through a lot of levels

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
It kind of freaked me out so

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Uh yeah there was that that was fun

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Let me go back to WoW for a minute cause

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Something happened on World of Warcraft

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
This week that kind of it actually

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Really ticked me off it really ticked me off

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I want to say this is what I think it is

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It is it's it's um a new feature well

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Here's the thing you know World of Warcraft one thing

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
They do very well is that they release

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Content patches all the time

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
That add new stuff to the game

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
New dungeons new features you know

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
One of the greatest things they've added to WoW

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Was just a couple patches ago the dungeon finder

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Uh was an amazing addition to the game

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That made leveling so different

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Yeah it was a great addition

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
This patch

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Sprays diarrhea

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
All over World of Warcraft

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It was a terrible content patch

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And I'll tell you why

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
For one now the game crashes

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Every so often now if you have

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Souped up settings on your computer

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
The draw distance it can't handle

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Then um and uh

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
The Ruby sanctum I guess was released

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
But it's not even open yet so what else

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
They can't open it until they get the patch

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Deployed to yeah

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
And then they release they release this thing

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Called real ID

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Real ID is what

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Allows you to cross communicate

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Through servers through factions

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
To other players that you want to

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Communicate with that's what I thought it was

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
It's kind of their way of being

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Xbox live or steam I

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Guess well you know the battle nets

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Kind of slowly trying to kind of poke

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Poke at the steam

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And the uh actually I would say it's most

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
You know what most reminds me of is Xfire I don't know if you remember

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Xfire but the whole way

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Battle nets going really reminds me of what Xfire

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Kind of was or is I guess

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I guess they're still going well they kind of want to integrate

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
The Starcraft 2 players are going to be coming up

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
With the wild players

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But real ID here's the thing

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Real ID

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Allows you to communicate with players

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
On any server

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And on any faction while you're still in wow

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So that's cool

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
But it doesn't use handles

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
It doesn't use numbers

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
It uses your real name

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
To communicate with other people

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
It uses the name you picked

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
When you signed up with battle net

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Which defaulted to the same name

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
That was on your credit card that you signed up with

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
To pay the game

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
You cannot change your name

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
So you must use your real name to communicate with people

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And I'm okay with that

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Because it is for your real life friends

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
You're not supposed to be giving this to people

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
You just randomly play wow with

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
That's what the normal Warcraft friends list is for

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm okay with this

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Here's what I'm not okay with

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And this is where I truly feel like

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Blizzard hijacked my privacy this week

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Is that

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
They copied a feature from Xbox Live

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Where you can view

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Your friends list and you can go into

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Any of your friends and view

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Their friends list

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Complete with their real name

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
So in other words

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
If I add a friend

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
On this battle net system

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Somebody

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
That might be trying to

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Find out my real name

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
Because I don't know

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
If it's a big secret or what have you

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
But I don't use my real name on this program

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Neither does Jamie

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Loki obviously isn't his real name either

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
You know we use fake names on the show

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
That people do out there in the world

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Like you know Bono

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
That's not his real name

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Cher is probably a shortened name

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Madonna really is her name

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Cher is actually Cher's name

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
But it's a shortened

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I thought she was Esther now

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Forget it

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
My point is there's a lot of people out there that don't use their real names

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And we don't either

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I actually thank Travis

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Back from Understation Live for making me use a fake name

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Because it's been really good

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I don't like my day job

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And my night job to conflict

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
It's nothing personal you guys

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
But just realize I have a day job

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Where I

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Privacy is a huge component of my day job

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And I can't have

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
What I do during the day and what I do during the night

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Conflict with each other

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
And like if that were to happen

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I couldn't do this show anymore

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Because I have to pay my bills

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
This show pays me nothing

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So I realize that most people are pretty respectful of that

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
But here's kind of my problem with Battle.net

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And I know a lot of people are like

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Well if you don't like it, don't use it

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
No shit Sherlock

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
But there's a lot of social pressure

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
To use it

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I have friends of mine asking

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Why won't you add me as a friend

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
And I tell them

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I can't have you

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
I can control adding you as a friend

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
But I can't control who you put on your friends list

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Well I'm not going to put anybody on there

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
You don't understand

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
That and you might know that

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
But there's some really messed up people in the world

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Many years ago

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Because of this program

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Had a stalker

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I had a stalker because of Orange Lawns Radio

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I don't like to talk about it a whole lot

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Because it's one of the few cases where

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I almost quit doing this show

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Because it was one of those cases where

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
The day job and the night job were starting to come together

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I was getting inappropriate phone calls

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
On my cellular telephone

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
With somebody who

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I had an association with

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Orange Lawns Radio

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I don't often talk about it

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
But it happened

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
And it's not something I want to happen again

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
How do I know

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Knowing that there's people like that out in the world

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
These people might try to use my friends

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
To get to me

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
And you might be looking at that

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Going wow that sounds very tinfoil hat-ish

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Or wow that sounds really kind of like

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
You're just like obsessing

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
But I'm telling you

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Until it's happened to you

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
You don't know what lengths people will go to

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I know

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
How do you think this person

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Got my phone number

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
That's what I'm talking about

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
And so

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I am totally with you guys

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
If you don't like it don't use it

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And I don't use it

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Because I don't want that to happen ever again

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
But the problem is

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It's there and now there's these social pressures

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And hearing guilds out there

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Are requiring people to use it

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
That is so screwed up

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Here's my point

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Blizzard is smarter than that

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
They should have known this would happen

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
When they implemented it

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
I don't know what in the hell they were thinking

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
With this

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And it's not just my problem

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I mean what I talked about I believe is very serious

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
But let's also consider that you have kids out there

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
16 and 17

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Whose parents are paying for their Warcraft account

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Absolutely

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Do you think parents know how to use it?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Think

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
When you were 16 or 17

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Did your parents know how to totally control your gaming

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Because I'll tell you mine sure didn't

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And it definitely wasn't because they were bad parents

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
It was just because I knew computers more than they did

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
I was playing Nintendo with my mom

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And so

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
If

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
World of Warcraft had been around when I was 16

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I guarantee you I would be on battle net

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
With my real ID with my mom's name

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And that's

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
This is like incredibly messed up

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
So basically Blizzard failed

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
To account for the stupidity

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And maliciousness of its players

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Mhmm

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Sorry potential stupidity and maliciousness

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Of its players

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Guilds requiring that?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
That is insane

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Because they want to know

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
If you're online

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It's these really stupid reasons

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
To use real ID

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
That's just like

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Common sense

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Or you can do what I do and don't play World of Warcraft

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
So

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
With Star Trek Online

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
They don't require you to have that stuff

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I know I'm trying to look at some of the

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Comments in our chat room

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Chat.orangelaunsradio.com if you want to join in

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Salacious Pop says

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
It only takes one person in an IRL guild

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
To add random pickup people to ruin it

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
For everybody else they know

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
I don't control my own list but I can't control my friends list

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
And that's what I really don't like about real ID

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
So honestly like I understand

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Blizzard in a board room somewhere

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Must have thought this was like

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
A good idea to combat I don't know

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Gold sellers or something

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I have, you know what? No

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I can't think of why this is a good idea. I really can't

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Well hopefully they'll tone that down

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I realize we have people

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And I'm surprised every week

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
At who is actually listening to Orange Lounge Radio

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Cause like didn't we have a guy email or call

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
That was like oh yeah I worked at Infinity Ward

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I was there

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
I was like really? I didn't know we had

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
People that worked there to listen to this show

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
If we have anyone that works at

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Active Blizzard that listens to this program

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Will you please

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Please help us get this

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Fixed because it is

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Just an embarrassment to World of Warcraft

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Right now. You know it

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Makes about as much sense as

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Locking down your Facebook privacy

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Settings and I think they need to do

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
The same thing. I know they tried to make

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Battle.net a little more social

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
A little more Facebook like

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
But they stumbled on

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
The same problem that Facebook had

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Privacy, seeing friends of

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Friends that you might not want to see

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I mean I keep my Facebook

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Locked down tighter than a frog's ass

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
For a reason

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Well yeah if they want to go the Facebook route though

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Facebook lets me change my name

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I use my radio name on Facebook

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Because I actually don't want day people to find out

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
It's just crazy

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I don't want to say it's a dual life I live because I have one life

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
But I'm just very conscious about

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
My internet trail

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
And I think you have to be in this day and age

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And I find the easiest way to separate your internet trail

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Is to use two names. It's very easy

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
When you do it that way

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Well you know actually I'm going to tell you this

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
The reason why I leave my actual name up there

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Is because I'm looking to get hired

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Right and I don't need that right now

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I'm marketing myself

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And everyone's got their own reasons for it

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
I think that actually it's

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But you know Facebook has this thing that

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
In their little rules or whatever

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
That says if they find out that you're using a pseudonym

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
That they can't delete your account

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
So anyway

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Tiger Claw Chat says

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
If Blizzard listens to this show they need to pay attention

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Sky is their biggest customer

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I appreciate the sediment

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And usually I'm one of the biggest proponents of Blizzard

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But people that actually get suckered into

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Going to Blizzcon are much bigger

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Customers than I am

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Yes I think you're kind of a sucker if you go to Blizzcon

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
And there's people I know and love that go to Blizzcon

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
And it's you know

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
It's just my personal feeling

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Well and that's the whole thing is that

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
It's not like Blizzard doesn't get enough money out of you

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Why don't you come attend for $150

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
This three day commercial

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
No thanks I'd like to be able to afford your next expansion

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Exactly

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
That's what Blizzcon basically

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I'd rather just play your damn game

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Anyhow I'm getting way off topic and there's people

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
That really don't want to hear this whole spiel

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I'm just saying

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
I think this is important to talk about

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
For a lot of different games

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Because you know Blizzard sets the standard

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
With a lot of things

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
This is one scary ass standard I don't want them setting

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I don't complain about Xbox Live

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Because I can change my name on Xbox Live

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I don't complain about Facebook

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Because I can change my name on Facebook

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
And I can lock it down to quote the ever eloquent

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Drunami tighter than a frog's ass

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
I cannot change my name on Blizzard

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
They hijacked it from my credit card

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And gave me what they would be using my name for

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
And that was wrong

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
That was wrong

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Ok

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Yay rant stud happy show happy birthday

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Happy show

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Alright Drunami what have you been playing

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Oh god how was my gaming year

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Well yeah in a nutshell

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I've been playing a whole crap load of WoW lately

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
I've actually been getting into the ratings scene

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Staying in the ratings scene

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Right now I imagine Arthas is just

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Sitting on his throne like Conan looking bored

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
R.P. Guild

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
But I've also been taking advantage

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Of a lot of Steam sales

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I am a consumer whore

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And how

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I'm buying a hell of a lot of Steam games

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Playing a whole lot of Steam games

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Oh have you seen the sale this week

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Oh god I did take advantage of Left 4 Dead 2

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Civ 4 is on sale again today

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I took advantage of Left 4 Dead 2

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Two days ago

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Yesterday they cut the price in half

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Don't you hate that

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
And I raged

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Steam is like gambling sometimes

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And then I shot zombies

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Then I shot zombies

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I have been really getting into

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
The Mass Effect series

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I played through Mass Effect 2 for the past couple months

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Loved the hell out of it

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Waiting for the third game in the trilogy

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I gotta jump in here real quick

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
This is a very important question in chat I want to answer

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Blaze in our chat room says

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Is this real ID nonsense going to be in

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Starcraft 2 and or more importantly

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
To me at least Diablo 3

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Yes

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
So that's why even if you don't play WoW

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Blizzard has a lock on some other PC gaming

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And I think it's important that

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You check

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Check it out because you know

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
That's why they rushed this patch

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Because Starcraft 2 is hitting shelves what next week

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
July 27th

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Oh I thought it was like July 7th ok but soon

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
So they had to implement the patch anyway sorry

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I just wanted to get that out there because it's a very important question

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
That needed answering from our chat room

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Lots of Mass Effect 2 lots of Killing Fool

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
A very underrated

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
First person shooter

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It's no Left 4 Dead but it's definitely underrated

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Console wise

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Not a whole lot

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
The new Tales

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
The Tales Symphonia sequel was good

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
I've been replaying that

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Finally got around to beating No More Heroes

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
But otherwise it's just been a whole lot of WoW

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
And a surprising amount of FPS

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I did finally get to play WoW

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Saints Row 2

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Mostly because a friend of mine gifted it to me

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And Loki you were into that right?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Saints Row 2?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Yeah

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
It had a lot of bugs for the PC port though

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
The PC port wasn't very good

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Oh yeah it just

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
It was still a fun game

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Just not as fun

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
And let's see I was playing Trine

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Not Twine, Trine

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Had a lot of fun

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Not Twine, Trine

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Had a lot of fun with that

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Yeah it was a lot of fun

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Isn't that a LucasArts game?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
No

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
It was an indie game

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
They had it on sale a couple months back

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I think they had it on sale the first day of this big segment

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Oh god

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Valve wants my money

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
They really do

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Other than that, that's about it

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I want your money as well

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You're not getting my money

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
So Dan is here in studio

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
We can't hear him because he's not on the mic

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
How you doing Dan?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Greetings

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Since you decided to bless our show

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I don't want to talk about games

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
But I want a moment of your show's time

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I want everyone to have a very very brief moment of silence

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Can I just say it's our birthday

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
To mourn the passing of Game Crazy this week

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
As of Wednesday

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
All Game Crazies closed down

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Wasn't Wednesday our birthday?

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Leaving me super unemployed

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Wednesday was our birthday

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Happy Birthday!

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
So everybody, send me your money

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I'm not worried about identity

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
If you want to send me some money

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I'll just give you my name

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
It's Rob

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Rob

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Send your money to Rob

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
He'll get it to me

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Yes, send Rob your money

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I'll be sure Dan gets all of it

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Be sure to send cash

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
I want his real name and address

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
I got it

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I will hook you up

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I know where he'll be every Sunday

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Every Sunday

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I know right where he's at

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I got this

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Dan, you're ignoring OLR tonight

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
To partake in the Mario Marathon, correct?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
No, not really

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
If I was ignoring OLR

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
I would be talking to you

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
You were a minute ago

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
You were on the couch watching Mario Marathon

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Those guys are not very good Mario players

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
But it's for a good cause

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Okay, it's for a good cause

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
We were actually sort of talking about that we should do something like that

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Except you need to play Sonic

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Except for you though

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Something awesome

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Hey, Tigerclaw's got a great suggestion in our chatroom

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Maybe Dan can be on OLR more often

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Now that he's jobless

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
And he can tell game crazy stories

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I never worked on Sunday

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I just didn't want to talk to y'all

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
I live with him

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
So I'm going to be on medical leave while he's off

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Oh my god, one of you two is going to kill the other

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Because you're both not going to be working

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Yeah, tell me about it

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
So anyways, if anyone knows a job

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I don't care what it is

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I'll shovel crap

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I'll play Sega games, whatever

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Just give me your money

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That means you, Andrew

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Next week on

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
It's the Jamie and Dan

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Household survivor

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Dan?

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I know where you live

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Only one of them can survive

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I know

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
A fight to the death

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
I know you know

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
We're going to do Paper Plate Battle Royale again

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
What are you talking about?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
By the way, by the way

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I just saw something that makes me incredibly excited

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
For my big DS9 fangirlism

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Is that episode 2 for Star Trek Online

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Is going to be launching on July 15th

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
And they're including mini games

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And one of them is Dabo

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Oh, Rama in chat says Dan should apply to Best Buy

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Uh, no

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I was waiting for a comment from the living room

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Dan!

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Are they hiring?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Are they hiring?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
I don't think he values his soul that much

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Oh, oh, oh my god

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Tigerclaw, brilliant

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Dan can try to sign in

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
To be a contestant in the latest

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Season of the tester

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
That showed that they're casting

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
For season 2 of the tester

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Dan should go on the tester

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Oh, you know every other thing he says would be

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And I play this beep game beep beep

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Beep game beep

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
That's a brilliant idea, Dan!

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
What?

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
You need to go on reality television

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I thought I was on reality television

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
No, we're going to put you on season 2

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Of the tester

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Yeah, I mean you're on reality radio now

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
No one listens to this show

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
And no one watches the tester

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
It'll be a perfect transition

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Chirp chirp

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Oh, Dan's back, hooray, my yelling worked

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
The tester, you know that reality show on

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
PlayStation Network season 2 is coming up

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
There's shows on PlayStation Network?

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Yes, you could be

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Is PlayStation Network where you go on when you're not on Xbox Live?

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Yes, there's actually going to have this whole

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Plus thing soon too, it's crazy

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The only reason I want to go on PlayStation Network is

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
What is that new game that looks like Strider

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That's four players

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I don't know, but

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
You could be a Sony game tester

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Sony games kind of suck

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Don't screw yourself

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
$10,000 to the winner

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Necromachina

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
That's not really that much money

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah, Necromachina, you should check that out

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
That game looks awesome

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
It's on PlayStation Network

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Are you playing Mario Crossover?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Yeah, they have the new version

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Are you in it now?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I set mine up to work with my gamepad

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
It's Rad to the Max

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
So I've been playing Mario Crossover this week

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And I've still been playing Mario Brothers X

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
There's my weekend gaming

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And I finished Red Dead Redemption and it was sad at the end

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Really?

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Jimmy wants this game too

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Jimmy wants everything

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I got no money

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Unless you send me some, send me money so I can buy my wife games

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Good luck to you in the job search

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Is this done by the same guy that did Strider?

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You're a hard worker

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You know, we have people that listen to this show

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
That knew you

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
From your store

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
That was like, oh my god, Jamie's married to the guy at that store

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Jamie's married to that big jerk

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Who works at Funkoland

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
That poor woman

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You guys don't know what it's like here

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
She's insane

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Alright

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Let's move on, we gotta get into gaming news

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Thank you, Dan

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Alright, housekeeping

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
And things that are coming up

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
No show next week

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
We already talked about that

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Oh, I wanna mention this real quick

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
iOS 4 is out

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Which is the iPhone thing

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
You know, iPad software

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
One of the things that's new in the iOS 4

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
And I'm not just talking about the iPhone 4

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I mean, yes, that's out too

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
But we realize a lot of people listen to this show

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
On their iPhones, their iPods, their iTouches

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
There's other devices too

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
We are aware

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
One of the new things

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
In iOS 4 is that the show descriptions

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Are actually now displayed

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
On the screen while you listen to the podcast

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
So we're gonna try in a couple weeks

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Something new with the notes for the show

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
And we think you'll really like it

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
But they're gonna be kind of expanded

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
And time stamped

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So we're gonna try something new

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And we're hoping you guys will like it

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
But that'll be in two weeks

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
On the podcast, or really the next podcast

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
That'll hit the feed after this one

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
It's gonna take more work that goes into it though

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
So, alright

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Appreciate it

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Yeah, I think people will like it

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It's kind of been a requested feature for a while

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
So we'll see what happens

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Alright, anyhow, we're only 45 minutes into the show

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
And it barely touched gaming news

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
How about some video game news?

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
We'll start off tonight with the one and only Loki

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Yes, so it's been confirmed

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That the 3DS is coming out in 2011

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Now, of course

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Before Reggie actually

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Yes, apparently

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is now a news

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Source

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It was announced that the

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
3DS would be out in

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Fiscal 2010

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I believe that's Fiscal 2010

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Which would be

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Between now and

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
March 31st, 2011

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
But now it's been confirmed that it's actually

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Gonna launch in 2011

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Do the math, it's gonna be the first 3 months

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Of the year

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
And, uh

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Yeah, that's neat I guess

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Hmm

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Kinda disappointing I guess if you're looking forward

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
To it for Christmas, but hey

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
There's enough crap coming out during Christmas

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
One less thing, I can deal

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
With that

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I totally agree that it's very

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Strange that Jimmy Fallon has now become

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
This kind of launching point for games, cause I guess

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
It was actually part of like a week of games or something

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Cause I don't know if you watch

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I don't know if you watch the clip

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
But Reggie kinda takes a jab

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
I believe it's Sony because he says something about

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
And, uh, it's not like the guys that were here last night

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
You don't need glasses to see this 3D

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
He said something like that in the clip

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
So it was, you know, it was just Reggie being Reggie

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
You know

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And, um, yeah

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
I mean, kind of a bummer though that it's

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Not coming out until 2011

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
But I totally wanna bet with GamerEidi

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And now I'm getting a lunch spot for me

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
So GamerEidi, if you're listening

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I like steak, just saying

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I'm just kidding

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Well, I'm actually not kidding, I did win a bet

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
But, um

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Do you think it was intended

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Maybe for Reggie to say this on the show

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Cause this seems like an odd place

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
To give details about the release date

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Or do you think it just kinda slipped

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I don't think it slipped, I think it's just that people

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
When they, I mean, they announced

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Fiscal 2010

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
And people were like, oh my god, I'm buying it in 2010

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Woooo

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
And so, instead of just everybody being disappointed

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
You know, by figuring out that, hey

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
It's not coming out at holiday

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
He just went ahead and announced it

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
So that, you know

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
You don't have to assume anymore

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Um

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
What do you think this leaves for

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Cause a lot of people were speculating that 3DS

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
And on our nightly shows for me

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
3, 2, I know Shane and I were having some discussions

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
On this, that the

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
3DS really had to come out this year

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Like, what else does Nintendo have for Christmas

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
So what do you think the holidays

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
What do you think the holiday season's gonna look like for Nintendo

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I think it's gonna be all their games

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
The Kirby and the Donkey Kong

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Not everything, I mean

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Donkey Kong I think and Kirby are gonna be this year

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I think Kirby's gonna be the one that's in November

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Um, there's a lot of stuff

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
I think for October, there's also a lot of stuff that they

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Haven't announced, or announced last year

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Uh, stuff that was shown on

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
E3 last year is coming out

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I know there's a game on

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
The Wii, or

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
I can't remember if it was the Wii or DS

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
It was one of the ones I saw last year though

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Um, so there's still stuff

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
That come out

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
For live me, I can't remember the timeline for uh

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Was it Metroid Other M?

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It's August 31st

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
It was supposed to be out a couple days ago

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Cause I remember it was my birthday weekend

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Actually today, I think it was supposed to be out today

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
But it got pushed back

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Well, that'll be a Christmas gift idea

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Yes, that's right, that came out instead

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Nope, I have not played it yet

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Yeah, I didn't really play the first one to be honest

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
My Wii is still not hooked up

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I will probably not be hooking it up until Metroid Other M comes out

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Cause I gotta play that

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
I've gotta play Metroid Other M

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
It does look cool

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Um, but yeah, I just

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I haven't played

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Um, the Wii console since

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
November, I think?

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Some comments in our chat room about

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Pokemon Black and White

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Pokemon Black and White is asking

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Is Pokemon Black and White cancelled?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Um, no

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
I believe they even announced a release date

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
October 19th in Japan

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Wasn't it even sooner than that?

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Like the 18th of September, I thought I read?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
No, it was October

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Regardless, it's fall in Japan

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah, fall in Japan

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
So it won't have 3DS support

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I bet you anything it'll be out April

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
In the US

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Because that's usually when they've been releasing

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Pokemon games around the April time frame

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Alright

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Well, we'll see if you're right or not

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I guess that's true, this last little one with the Pokewalker

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Ball came out in April-ish

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Uh, that's March

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
That's right, it was right before PAX East

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
But, Pokemon

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
HeartGold, SoulSilver, that was March

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Pokemon Platinum was March

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Pokemon

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Explorers of the Sky

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Explorers of Time, that was April

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Uh

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Diamond Pearl was April

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
So, yeah

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It's usually March or April

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Uh, AlphaCananagram is speculating

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
in our chatroom at chat.orangetonjr.com

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I wouldn't doubt Pokemon Black and White

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
will have 3DS compatibility

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Remember, Pokemon Red and Blue

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
had colors written in the programming for

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Super Game Boy

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
But the 3DS cards are a little bigger

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Maybe it won't matter, I don't know

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Could be like the advanced dungeons in Zelda

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
That's what I think of

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
They might, I mean

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
I would say if anything it's gonna have

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
DSi support, probably not

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
3DS

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
It might have some really silly stuff, like the whole game

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
won't be in 3D, but maybe like the evolution scenes

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
or something silly, just like little one-off

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
things will be in 3D, little little things

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
We'll see

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
I don't think so, and the only reason why is because they're gonna be in the old carts

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
and it's gonna be too hard to

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
hold that extra data on there

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
But DSi support's been something that they've been doing

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
a lot with different games, not necessarily

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
You don't have to play it on the

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
DSi, but if you do, you can

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
do different things

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Also some other comments in chat

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Rama's a big fan of the 3DS

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
saying, I will get a 3DS and I will shank someone

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
if I have to, I think a lot of people feel that way actually

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Frisbee is trying to top us all

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
saying, I haven't played my Wii since 2008

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I'm curious though

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
if Frisbee's gonna break it out for anything

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
that Nintendo announced this year

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
I did play Wii Sports Golf

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
on

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Friday because they were setting up something

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
for some company

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
that we had coming into our work

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
They were having a Wii Sports Golf tournament

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I don't think day job stuff should count though, to be honest

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Well in that case, I don't play Grand Theft Auto ever

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Well

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Okay, you do that on your break though, but I get what you're saying

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Well technically it wasn't working

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
if I'm playing Wii Sports Golf

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
But I asked them

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
like, why don't you have Wii Sports

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Resort Golf? That would be better

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Maybe they're just not ready for that

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
No, they're just lame

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Alright, well I believe Loki warned you about this

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
to go to another console real quick

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I believe Loki warned you about this last week

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
when all the E3 news was hitting

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
but it does seem like it has been confirmed

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
In fact, a Microsoft representative this week actually spoke to the blog

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I'm sure a lot of you know that blog

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Microsoft representative confirmed to them that

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
a $199 version

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
of their new Xbox 360

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
which they're now calling the

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
short Xbox 360

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
let me put that in quotes

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
they're not calling it the slim now, which is good

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
because we talked about this last week

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
it is not the Xbox 360 slim

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
it has another name

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
so anyway, it is going to be coming out for $199

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
there is also

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
a new setup that's going to have the

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Xbox system and Kinect together

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
which I think a lot of people knew

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
so there you go

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
$199 Xbox 360

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
system coming out soon

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
no date, no idea

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
probably what, fall-ish, I think you were predicting

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Loki, before the holidays for sure

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
for the new system

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I bet you

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
well the new with the

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Kinect isn't coming out until when the

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Kinect does, so that will be November 4th

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I bet you the $199

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
system probably as

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
early as

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
September

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
just to cash in on Halo Reach

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
so in other words

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
if you were thinking about

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
getting an Xbox right now, wait

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
well wait and see

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
anyways because you know how they

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
saying that there is going to be a new $199

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
what if they're just dropping the price of the system

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
to $199

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
you never know

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
I would think though

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
if anything, I mean they do a lot of their

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
price drops and big pushes towards

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
the holiday and especially when they

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
want to capitalize on a game like Halo

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Reach, just wait for

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
some better deals to be coming

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
out and besides, even if you wait longer

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
what they've been doing

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
in the past is bundling in some games

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
with your Xbox 360

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
system for free, so

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
if you do wait, you still might get some free stuff

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
AlphaKananagram in our chat room

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
at chat.org.com is asking, wait how much

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
is this bundle, did they say, I must

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
know for Child of Eden, everyone's speculating

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
what, $300? I think $300

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
well $299

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
is what the system is right now

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
it might be $399

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
hmm

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
I wonder if there'll be a basic version with

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Kinect though, I bet there is

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
it's hard to say, if they're gonna

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
do, well

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
I don't know, they could do a smaller hard drive

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
because the hard drive is removable, it is

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
just like the PS3

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I know, isn't that awesome?

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
it is awesome

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
alright, lowkey, how big is the hard drive

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
are you gonna try to put a terabyte drive in there?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I'm not getting a new system, oh yeah you don't need one

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
you have like five Xbox 360s

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
I wish I had five Xbox 360s

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I don't know how many

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Xbox 360s I have anymore

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
that's crazy, that's awesome though

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
alright, well speaking about the Xbox 360

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
it doesn't look like

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
they're gonna really be getting Final Fantasy 14

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
because

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
their system is so different

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
they were wanting to play

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
like a normal internet environment

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
and wanted to basically

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
for the console to mirror how it works on the PC

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
and Microsoft

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
has a closed environment

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
so they still can't work up an agreement

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
yet

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
seems so odd to me because

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I remember being at E3

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
a couple years ago when the Xbox 360

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
was just coming out, like it was the big year

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
that they were gonna launch the 360 and one of the games

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
that they were highlighting as like

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
landmark on that platform was Final Fantasy 11

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
so it's not like

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Xbox Live has never had an MMO

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
and ironically it was the game that came out

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
in the same series as this game

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
we're hearing about now

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
which looks suspiciously similar

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
well that's a whole other Oprah

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
but Final Fantasy 11

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I don't think it did that well

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
on the 360 and I really don't have

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
anything to base it off of

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
but I'm just kind of knowing who played it

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
what systems they were playing on

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I don't think it did well on the 360 because

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
most people who wanted to play it already had it

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
on PS2 and PC

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
you know what I mean? I don't know if that

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
set a bad precedent for MMOs in general

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
but if that was the case, that seems kind of crappy to me

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
but there's one other MMO

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
on Xbox 360 right now and that's Fantasy

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Star Universe. Again, I don't think that

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
did very well either

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
They also were trying to get champions online

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
they said that the game

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
ran just fine, it was the business

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
end of getting everything in line

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
It seems strange to me that Microsoft

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
is kind of shooting themselves in the foot

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
with these MMOs, especially with Final Fantasy 14

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
and DC Universe, both slated

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
for the PS3 this fall

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
I mean, this could be where the

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
and what, PS3 has their own agency

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
we know it's coming out too? What MMOs

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
are on their way for 360? Are there any at this point

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
that we know of? No

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
If any, they need a recent

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
MMO like Final Fantasy 14

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
I mean, if trends

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
are to be believed, they got

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
MMOs that were sort of past their prime

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
It's kind of just our universe

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
but that didn't really take off

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
the way that PSO did

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Or they're turning their nose up at MMOs

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
which, you know, they could get away with doing

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
possibly. MMOs have always

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
You know, Sony somewhat is

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I don't know if they're necessarily taking a risk

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
but the developers are taking a risk putting the games out

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
on PS3, but I don't know

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Like, again, I really enjoy

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
DC Universe on the PS3 that I

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
played at E3

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
and I could see myself paying money for that

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
on the PlayStation 3

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
If they succeed, then

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
they're just going to have to catch up

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I don't know, it just seems very

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
strange to me that they would not

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
be trying to bend over backwards to get Final Fantasy

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
14 on their system, but maybe they're thinking

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
you know what, 11 didn't do that great

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
so 14's not going to either

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
I have no idea

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I think Microsoft has their own agenda

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Comment from Salacious Pop

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
in chat, and this is something he was telling me about

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
earlier today, and I want to share this with you guys too

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Champions Online was developed

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
for a 360 release

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Even playing the PC version

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
you can see the 360 integration

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
screaming at you from the UI

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Champions Online was a huge flop

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
and it probably has to do with the fact that at least

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
50% of its platform audience never

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
actually got the game

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
So there you go

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Champions Online

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
maybe was, unfortunately

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
did end by this whole fact that

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
the 360 was not going to be having its MMO

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
or made it too difficult

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Unfortunate

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Bochikawa says

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
PS3 is a free online service

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
same on PC, I think Microsoft lost

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
majorly because of that

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Well keep in mind, I can't remember for PSU

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
but I know for Final Fantasy 11

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
it would work with a silver account

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
The really crazy thing about

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Final Fantasy 11 I think people sometimes forget

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
is that it had this whole

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
play online front end

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
they're not going to have that for Final Fantasy 14

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
thank god

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Play Online was cool for like 30 days

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
and then it was like, this thing is a pain in the butt

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Play Online was never cool

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Play Online was never cool

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I thought it was cool when it first came out

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
but that was it. But anyhow

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Play Online is on the 360 version

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
but here's the crazy thing about Play Online

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
It's a joint venture between

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
Square Enix and

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
and Sony

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Play Online is a

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Sony code and it was on

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
the 360

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Final Fantasy 11

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
was a really not typical

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
game on the 360

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
it broke all the rules

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
but they were excited to have a Final Fantasy game on their

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
console, they let it break the rules

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
just like they let Castlevania

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
break the rules and it ended up setting a

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
precedent with the whole

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Symphony of the Night coming out on the arcade

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
breaking the cap

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Keep in mind, in Japan

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Symphony of the Night did come out on the Saturn

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
What's that have to do with the 360

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
one though? Because

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
even back in the day

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Sony didn't

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
have the whole exclusive

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
it was supposed to have been

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
exclusive and then the Saturn version came out

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
which apparently had all the stuff that the programmers

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
never got to put in. I see, I get you

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
so

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I don't know, it would be interesting to see

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
what kind of comes of that

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
And the Saturn version was better. I think honestly

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
if you haven't heard of it by this point Final Fantasy 14

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
will not be on the 360

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
release date anyway. Can they add it

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
next year if the game becomes popular?

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Maybe, but I don't know

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I don't know

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
guys, I really don't

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I'll try Final Fantasy 14 but I'm just kind of like

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
there's something about it

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
I have a really bad feeling

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
it's gonna flop

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I don't know what it is

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
I think just because 11 was so received mixed

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
and I don't think the

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
PS3 is as adopted as the PS2

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
was and the 360

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I don't know, call me crazy

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
What's funny is there's still a Final Fantasy

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
14 SKU on Xbox 360

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
it still exists

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
whether it's actually gonna come out or not

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Well I think it's a place holder

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
You know what though, there might be a lot that

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
they're developing that they don't plan on releasing

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I mean maybe a 360 version is further

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
along than any of us are giving credit for

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
because one other thing I don't know if we

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
talked about when we did the E3 report but

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Final Fantasy 14 also supports 3D

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
right now. You can put on 3D glasses

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
if you have those uber monitors for your PC

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
you can play Final Fantasy 14 in 3D

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
so, but they

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
they took great caution to

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
tell us

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
we're messing with this right now, we don't know if it's

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
gonna be in the full release

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
this is a concept thing that you're seeing

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
so, who knows there

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Bochikawa in our chatroom

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
says 14 will suck, yes, but it will still sell

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
we'll see, we'll see

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
again, I hate to base my opinion

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
off an early build of the game

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I do believe though, I think

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
if 14 gets delayed to next year

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
it's not bad news

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
but that's just me

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
anyhow, Loki, what do you got for us?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Apparently there's a rumor coming

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
from Bloomberg saying

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
that Sony may

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
close a deal

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
securing the rights

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
to bring Hulu

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
to the PlayStation Network, it says the partnership

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
could be announced as soon as next

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
week and

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
that's kind of interesting since

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
you know, apparently there's

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
also a similar report saying that

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
it might be coming to Xbox 360

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and the iPad as well

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
and would offer a premium Hulu

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
service where you could possibly pay

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
for maybe streaming of old

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
you know, archive stuff

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
kind of

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
interesting actually that

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
they're thinking about bringing to that platform

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I don't know, I think it'll eventually

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
probably make its way to

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
each console platform

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
except for the Wii maybe

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
but why not, you can kind of

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
do it right now with, well you could have done it

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
before with the web browser, you can do it with

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
third party software like diversity and stuff

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
like that, but

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I could definitely see this happening

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
It's interesting that Hulu keeps coming up

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
time and time again, like it's just like

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
it happened already, darn it

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
yeah

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
it's just

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
a matter of time

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
we're just waiting to see what

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
happens

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
alright, well something I really don't think

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
you need to wait much longer to see if it happens or not

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
has to do with the price of Kinect

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
you know what we've been saying

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
you know, as have most of the gaming press

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
that Kinect is going to cost you

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
$150, but Microsoft for whatever reason

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
just won't confirm it, like

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
they will not tell you the price of Kinect

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
but then this week, on the official

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Microsoft store, that's right

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
online, you know, Microsoft has a store online

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
just like Apple does, and a lot of different companies do

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
they now are selling the Kinect

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
sensor for the Xbox 360 for

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
$149.99

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
so there you go

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
that's like, what a week costs

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
yeah, interesting, huh

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I really hope this comes with

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
a bundle in game, cause just

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
$150 for the device itself

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
it better come with a bundle of several games

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
ow, I shot myself in the foot

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
well

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
the rumor is, it is

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
coming bundled with a game

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
oh really, Loki, what have you heard?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
um, I heard that there's going to be a pack-in game

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
not sure what it is

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
um, I don't think it's anything that's probably been

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
announced yet, it's probably just tech demos

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
well not tech demos, but like

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
remember how Wii Sports was

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
that was all their tech demos

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
that'd be my guess

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
it could be very well

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
one of like, Kinect Sports or something like that, you never know

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
well one other quick thing on Kinect I want to get

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
out there is that if you were unable to go to

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
E3, and you happen to

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
live near a Microsoft store

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
there's not a lot of these, there's like

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
four, I think there's like two in Southern California

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
one in Arizona, I want to say

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
there's not a lot of these, there's like four Microsoft

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
stores, they're kind of like Apple

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
stores, but instead of Apple

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
it's Microsoft

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
you can play the Kinect in the stores

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
they actually have the demos right now

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Kinectimals, according to the official

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Twitter for the stores, which is at

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
the Microsoft store on Twitter

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
is the game that's being shown off right now

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
so it sounds like they were going to rotate in

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
different Kinect games

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
you know what I noticed when they have a new piece of

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
interface technology, remember when the DS

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
was just released and they just

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
had games

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
that amounted to just tech demos, I mean like

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Yoshi Touch and Go

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and then for the first

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
first part of the lifespan of the Wii

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
they just had games that were mostly just tech demos

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I would hope since

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
the motion sensor technology has matured by now

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
that Microsoft would have

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
more than glorified tech demos

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
well the technology has matured but unfortunately

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
people and developers

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
have not matured and

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I understand that developers

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
can do way better than what's out there

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
right now, but people like what's

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
out there right now and so that's why they're

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
emulating the same stuff you see on other systems

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
like a Wii sports type game

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
a Wii sports resort type game

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
a party game

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
you know that kind of stuff

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
since you brought up the DS launch titles though

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
I have to say this because this always cracks me up

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
you know what DS game

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I don't know if it was a launch title but it came out in the first

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
three months, it was a launch

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I owned Ping Pals

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Oh it was so terrible, Ping Pals was so

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I bought two copies, I was coerced into buying

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
two copies

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
it was so terrible, but here's why

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
it was this awesome DS game

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I say awesome very sarcastically by the way

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
where you could chat

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
with other people on their

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
nearby DS's by like

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
drawing and you could do these

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
draw chats back and forth

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
and that's what Ping Pals was all about

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
it was PictoChat with avatars

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
boy Nintendo fucked them over

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
didn't they by putting that in their system

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
and it was $30 times two

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
it's like yeah you can pay for this

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
or you can play it for free now

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
yeah Ping Pals wasn't even online

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
it had these avatars

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I guess there was some type of game

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
you may remember Rob

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
that when the DS came out

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
they didn't have online

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
that's right

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
it was like that hidden thing

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Nintendo always puts that magical

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
thing in their new system

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
they'll tell you later, gotcha

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
it was in there the whole time

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
there's always something like that

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
seriously, with the DS it was the internet

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
secretly it was there the whole time

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
the Wii has some slumbering

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
stuff like that too, the channels

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
that they come out with

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
so since the buying public

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
is used to it, Microsoft's gonna

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
pick up a shovel and Sony's gonna pick up

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
a shovel and just start shoveling

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
games our way

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
well here's what I'm saying

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I understand that

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
the Wii has the advantage of the price

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
point because it's $150

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
now

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and they do have the

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
disadvantage that they're getting

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
you have to buy the extra sensor

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
if you wanna play those games

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
um

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
but I mean once again it's all about

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
perception because yeah, Wii costs

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
you know, $150 but

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
let's say if you're playing, you know, setting it up

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
for a family of four, it's gonna

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
cost a lot more to do that with the Wii

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
than it would be on the Xbox 360

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I mean

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
even though you may, you know, it may seem

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
that the Wii's a better choice with all the extra

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
added crap to it, it's gonna

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
add up and

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
with Sony it's the same thing, you're gonna have to

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
buy all these different accessories, now I know you

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
don't have to buy all these accessories if you

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
wanna play by yourself, that's fine

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
or if you wanna play with just one other person

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
you know, then you can save yourself a little bit

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
of money but at least with the Kinect

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
it'll support up to as many players

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
as the game will support

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
alright, before we get to Jamie's next

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
story and then the release dates here, I've gotta read this

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
real quick because this was linked to us in chat by Robocoon

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
linked us to the official Ping Pals

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Wikipedia article and I've gotta read this

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
excerpt cause it's gold, ready?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Keep in mind this is Wikipedia

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Ping Pals was released on December 8th

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
2004, although it was marketed

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
as a non-violent, girl-friendly game

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
it was frequently criticized as not

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
being interactive enough to be called a game

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
in addition to this, the DS has a

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
built-in chat program called PictoChat

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
PictoChat includes features that

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Ping Pals lacks and due to this, the game

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
received poor ratings, for instance

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Nintendo Official Magazine gave

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
it 9% in its Nintendo

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
DS special with the opening

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
sentence saying, with PictoChat

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
coming as standard, this is

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
a bit like paying money to breathe air

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
the reviewer

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
gave a one-word written summary reading

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
pointless

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
uh, let's see, uh, Electronic

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Gaming Monthly gave the game an average of

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
.5 out of 10

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
with the game receiving two zeroes and

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
one 1.5

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
it was really shiny, girl-friendly air

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
that's my favorite, girl-friendly

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
ha ha ha

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
yeah, that's why I had to buy two

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
copies, I love it, maybe even a brain-dead

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
vegetable hooked up to life support girl-friendly

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
the GM, GMR magazine

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
gave it a 0 out of 10

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
it's below their normal scale

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
nice, alright, Dar Sakura

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
what do you have for us, do you have a girl-friendly story for us?

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I have something that makes me happy, okay

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Facebook games are going poop

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
um, and keep

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
in mind the only thing that I play is Hotel City

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
good, I'm a fan of not playing Farmville

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
yeah, I hate Farmville

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Farmville is like the poop

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
that dung beetles poop

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Farmville's free on the iPhone

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
right now, you know

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
they'd have to pay me, at any rate

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
my friends are now playing Frontierville

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Gamasutra, um

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
keeps up with, you know, who's

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
playing what on Facebook games

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
and, um, basically

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
uh, the

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
the big Zynga games have gone down

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
um, Farmville went from

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
66.6 million, ooh, evil

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
to 63.9 million

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Treasure Isle dropped 2.5

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
million, and Cafe World lost 1.5

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
million, um, the only

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
thing there that's really keeping it

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
steady is, uh

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
well, that's attracted new players is

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Texas Hold'em Poker

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
they got 28.6 million players

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
you gotta wonder how many of those are actual people

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I, you know

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I hate the stupid games

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I think people are finally starting to go

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I'm wasting my time

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I could do something

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
have you ever heard the music in Farmville?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
oh, they made new ones

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
what?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
oh god, when I played Farmville, nevermind

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
when I used to play Farmville

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
the theme song was so horrible, it was this

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
one thing that would loop over and over

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
and over again, I guess now

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I tried it once

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
and then I was like

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
ugh, why

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
and like, it's not even why is a question

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
it's why is a statement

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
like, if I was typing it

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
it would be, it would have no capitalization

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
and have a period at the end

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
it would just be why

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
or what

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
what

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
yeah, it would be a statement, it wouldn't even

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
require grammar

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
but see, here's the thing

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I'm actually really looking forward to the Civilization

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Facebook game

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
like, there's some really cool sounding stuff around the corner

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
you're a civ nerd

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I really am

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
go by civ

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
like 7-Elevenville

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I don't think I'll play 7-Elevenville

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
but no, I would go into 7-Elevenville

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
that's not a joke, is it?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Zanga Zanga Zanga Zanga

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
whatever has really taken over 7-Eleven

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
it's kind of disgusting

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
what kind of Slurpees do they have?

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I didn't even look

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
at the Iron Man stuff

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
did you see what was in my kitchen?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I have a War Machine Slurpee cup

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I don't even drink Slurpees

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
and I got a War Machine cup because I'm gonna repaint it

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
what's great though is some of the Farmville parodies

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I gotta say, because there's one called Farmvillain

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
that's great

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
that I guess, like Robocoon is saying

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
you can now collect horse semen on your farm

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
like, there's, you know, horrible things that happen there

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Rama says in our chat room

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
and this is why I play Pot Farm

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
that's gonna be a reality

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
in California after November

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
I don't know if you heard

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
it's qualifying for the ballot

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
do you want to smoke weed?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
yes or no, in a nutshell

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
oh god, what is my anti-nausea medication

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
it'll pass

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
well, not even a question

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
it's gonna pass

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I'm glad you asked, because it's coming in November

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
no, no, no, no

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
the anti-nausea medication FROM

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
all that

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
yeah, but that actually is good for anti-nausea

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
they're actually allergic to it, but then again some people also allergic to cigarette smoke

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
dude, California's gonna be the only place

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
where you can go to Taco Bell

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
and get a number one that comes with a quesadilla

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
two crispy tacos

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
a gordita

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
and BUD

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
and a joint

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
we're gonna be

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Amsterdam the sequel

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
oh my god, it's a good time to stay indoors

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
just need the hookers now

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
here's the thing

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
for like 60 days

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
ahh, it's too far away

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
for 60 days, it's gonna be the most

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
lolsy thing you could ever imagine

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
everybody will be

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
eye for like 60 days

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
not everybody, I don't smoke pot

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
California stood still

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
there's gonna be so many people

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
just like, it's 4.20 every day

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and then, you know what

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
it's gonna, ok, alright

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
it's like when prohibition was eliminated

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, pass out, wake up

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
ok, we're over

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I'm gonna get political for a second, Rob, may I?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
oh hell why not

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
disclaimer, ok, let's go ahead

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
and look back at history, and this is why

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
this whole stupid war on drugs thing is

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
pretty much bullshit

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
when they made booze

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
illegal, what happened?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
an increase in crime

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
we had the heyday of the

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
old school gangster

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
you know, but Dick Tracy was here

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
to make it all better

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
but my point is

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
that when you made booze illegal

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
crime went up

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
now, and this is actually

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
the best way I can paraphrase it

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
ok, there was a Bloom County strip

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
a while back, you know where Opus the Penguin came from

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
and

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
he and Oliver Wendell

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Jones

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
were selling

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
hair growing tonic made from cat sweat

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
and

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
the moment it became illegal, their prices

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
shot up, so they could charge more

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
for it, and then they were having people

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
you know, run guns and everything

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
and another one actually in the same comic

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
is when

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Opus and Bill were running for president

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
and the drug traffickers came up and said

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
we hope you'll have tough gun laws, that makes

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
more profit for us

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I mean, I know that that's

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
you know

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
a parody, you know, just a little political

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
commentary on it, but

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
the numbers are there

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
you know, gun free zones

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
have a higher

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
rate of gun related deaths

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
than

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
you know, places where it's legal to

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
carry a firearm

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
criminals don't really care if it's legal or not

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
no, but they're less likely

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
to use it when the other person might be armed too

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I feel like Jamie should have a theme song when she's giving

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
history lessons here on the show

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
so do you want to continue with your history lesson

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
yes I do

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I'll play a little bit of

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
God Save the Queen here

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
anyway

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
but I'm saying

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I'm going to completely second what you said

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Rob, the moment that the

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
pot loss pass

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
you're going to have a month where people are going to go

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
ahhhhh

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
and all of the right wing nut jobs

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
are going to go, ah see we told you

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
and then

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
a month later, two months later

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
it'll be nothing, no one will care

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
you mean I can go outside?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
yes, it's safe

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
you mean I actually do go outside?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
um, it's safe

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
but you know what this means

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
there will come a day

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
the Orange Lounge radio episode where we're all

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
high as fuck

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
and that will be just another episode

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
where I'm in the chat room

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
yeah, me too, it'll sound like every other episode

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
yeah, I'm allergic to pot too

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
but my whole point

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
my whole point, and this is the

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
biggest thing with, in fact

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I've been listening to a lot of

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
history podcasts and maybe I'll plug

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
them later, but

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
the biggest thing for anyone

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
if you want to look at what's going on in business

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
right now, if you want to look at what's going on

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
in politics right now

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
if you want to see, is A or

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
B going to work, look

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
to about a hundred

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
to eighty years ago

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
and

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
you know, then tell me, will it work?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
well I think

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
oh, it's the same idea, it's the same idea

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
I think in this year, 2010

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
the question is not, will it work

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
but will it blend

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
alright

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
but, okay, thank you for letting me rant

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
you're welcome

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
just the biggest thing is that

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
if you want to see if something's going to work now

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
look to the past

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Frisbee in our chat room says, OLR with weed

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
is Orange Lounge foodie-o, like I said

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
just like every other week

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
have you ever done OLR

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
on weed?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
you boys like Mexico?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
and by the way

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
one last little political

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
snipe, if you

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
want to see what

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
for all the advocates that were

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
voting for unregulated business

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
look back to

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Carnegie and to

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Rockefeller and see how well

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
people fared when they were in control

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
of unregulated business

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
including moderation

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
alright, yes, moderate moderation

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
alright, that's redundant

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
alright, let's

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
thank you for calling the department

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
your redundancy is repetitive

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
alright, let's move on

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
release dates

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
weed is coming out November 4th

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
just kidding

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
alright, what's coming out in the US

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
you know that's kind of odd

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
it's timed right with the connect

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
connect

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
works off weed

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
anyways, there's

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
lots of stuff actually coming out this week

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
pretty decent release week which is good because

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
next week there's not a whole lot

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
so this week we've got

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Sin and Punishment start successor

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
actually it's not this week, that's today

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
so you've missed out on it already

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
possibly

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
and you wasted your whole day watching the Mario

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
marathon and you could have been playing Sin and Punishment

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Sin and Punishment, at least it's a good cause

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Death Smiles

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
limited edition, making its way out to the

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Xbox 360 this week

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
a pretty awesome shmup game, definitely worth

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
picking up, and plus you get a nice little

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
face plate for your Xbox 360

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
and the soundtrack, so

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
sounds like a good deal

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Think Smart on Nintendo DS, yet another brain

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
training game

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Lego Harry Potter on the

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Wii, DS, and PSP

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
and probably the PC as well

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
A 10 Minute Solutions from

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Activision, it's a fitness game

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
based off, I guess, a DVD series

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
99 Nights 2

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
now with more nights

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Coming to Xbox 360

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
99 Nights 2, night harder

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
99 Nights 2, Electric Boogaloo

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Singularity

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
on Playstation 3, Xbox 360

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
and PC

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
might call that Time Shift 2

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
The

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Last Airbender, the game

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
based off the movie, based off the

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
anime, based off

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
another game, no

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
that's on DS and Wii

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I'm sure it's going to be so much better than the

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
you know, the ones based

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
off the animated series

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
the twist is not

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Sniper Ghost Warrior

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
on PC and Xbox 360

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Sniper Ghost Warrior?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Yes

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Sniper Ghost Warrior

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
It's not like a sci-fi movie

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
starring, you know, Debbie Gibson

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I'm sorry, Deborah Gibson and Tiffany

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
They're like ghosts because they hide

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
in the shadows and snipe you in the head

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I gotta start that tangent again

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
about why they need to make games out of sci-fi movies

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
because did you hear the one this week about

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Debbie Gibson and Tiffany being in a movie?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Together?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I saw that article and I was just like

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
I don't care

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
You know what though? I do agree

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
with you because cheesy games do

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
end up being

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
pretty cool, which is why

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
once again I must

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
urge you D3

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
publishing, bring over the

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
simple series. Come on

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
you know you wanna

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
and I know Oni Chumbara didn't really do that well

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
over here, but Earth Defense Force 2017

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
is so awesome! All you need to do

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
is remake the second game. I know the

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
second game was almost the first game

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
all over again and the third game was basically the

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
first game all over again, but

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
it's, you don't really need to do anything

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
all you need to do is put more levels

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
and they only have to be that different

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
just more levels, completely forget

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
the last games existed, add a few different

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
enemy types, I think you should make a

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
level editor in there, and four player co-op

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and four player system link

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
or four player over live

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Speaking of gold

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
speaking of Ludacris, you might like this Logie

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I was listening to Bobby's show on the way over here

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
in the car, on the handy dandy all games

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
iPhone app, and he was

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
talking about risk factions, and I'm kind of

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
paraphrasing here because I haven't played the game myself

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
but he did, but he was talking about

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
how, you know, there's classic risk in there

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
where you can play as all the different countries and dah dah dah dah

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
but in one of the new modes, like a story mode

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
or whatever, like the different factions are like

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
humans, zombies

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
and cats

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
and robots

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I'm like, this sounds awesome!

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
So, you can

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
lead an army of cats against an army

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
of zombies. Amazing!

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
So we need more cheesy games

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
like, uh, Tachyon

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
starring Bruce Campbell. President cat, hello

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
whatever happened with that, don't think I even forgot

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
I mean, look at the symbol series over in Japan

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
on the Playstation 2, they've released

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
like a good 50 games

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
at least, in that series

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
you know, for like 20 bucks

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
they just take these really weird, independent

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
games, I guess, and then throw them out there

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I mean, they have one with

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
versus with, you know, miniguns

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
you know, mowing down zombies

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
they have zombies versus ambulance

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
you drive an ambulance and you run over

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
zombies, it's awesome

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
and then, you know, there's actually a lot of games

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
with zombies now that I think of it

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
for the simple series, because there's only

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Chambara, which is basically you fighting zombies

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
with a samurai sword and a chick wearing a bikini and a cowboy hat

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
but Earth Defense Force

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
is so awesome though

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
it's an incredible game

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
and I really want to go back and play the Playstation 2

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
version of Earth Defense Force 2

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
because they have like a chick with a jet pack

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
you can fly around as

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
they have these different

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
different looking characters

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I mean, they're the same

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
they have the robot types and the UFOs and stuff like that

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
but the one robot type in there

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
kind of looks like a tripod from War of the Worlds

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
and that's really cool!

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
and it's just, the whole point is cheesy stuff

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
even like, you know

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Zombies Ate My Neighbors

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
a perfect example of how you can make a game that's cheesy

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
that parodies a bunch of like, you know

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
old sci-fi horror movies

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I think it's a great idea

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
but anyways, we're getting on a tangent here

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
so

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
O.S. we do!

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
More stuff coming up this week

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Fallen Earth Blood Sports on PC

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Kind of wonder, what sports

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
are they playing in Fallen Earth?

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I don't know

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
It doesn't say

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
I think it's an expansion

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Uninterested

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Missed on DS

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I'm guessing that must be re-released

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
because I could have sworn that's been released before

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
or maybe it's a different publisher now

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
but if you haven't picked that up

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
you can pick it up now

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
play a game that's really, really old

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Let's see

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
What other fun stuff do we have here?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Oh yeah, Just Sing

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
with microphone for the DS

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
so you can sing karaoke

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
on your DS

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Not quite

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Different company

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
I wonder if you can sing

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Brew

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Naughty Bear

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
on Playstation 3

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
There's a lot of those in San Francisco

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Did you see the trailer for that?

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That looks like fun!

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
No, I haven't seen it

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
I'll YouTube it right now

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
It's like Hitman with teddy bears

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
You're trying to get revenge on all the other teddy bears

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
in the village

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
and the whole point is to be as evil as possible

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
you have an evil meter

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
or a naughty meter

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
and you can kill them but you get more points

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
for torturing them and being witnessed

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
torturing them

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
So it's Overlord with teddy bears

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
It's beautiful

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
It's horrible and beautiful at the same time

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I love it

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Oh wait, this is an ad

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
fucking YouTube, hold on

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Crackdown 2

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
is an excellent game that will be coming out next week

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
on the 6th

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I want Naughty Bear

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
But it's way better than Naughty Bear, sadly

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Naughty Bear though, you can set traps for them

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Do you know how much fucking traffic

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
those naughty bears caused in San Francisco today?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I had to go around

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Oh, here we go

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
360

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Shut up

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
This is quality radio ladies and gentlemen

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
