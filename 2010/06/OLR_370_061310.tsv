0	20520	Tonight, June 13th, 2010, the E3 News Barrage begins and we connect with our listeners to
20520	32040	get all your feedback on the early news.
32040	34360	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
34360	37740	Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
37740	42440	This is episode number 370 for June the 13th of 2010.
42440	47880	We are that video game show where every gamer has a voice and walking you over the next
47880	53120	few hours on this very, very busy show tonight, myself, Rob Roberts, and joined us always
53120	57760	by the one, the only, but the sadly sickly, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
57760	59320	I'm not sick anymore.
59320	63720	But you're going to sound it on the radio though because you have your voice thing going
63720	64720	on.
64720	73960	The problem is I had a viral infection and it coughed my throat, well, bloody, so I'm
73960	78440	actually not supposed to use my voice much until the 21st.
78440	83080	So Dark Sakura's role in tonight's show will be scaled back just a little bit, just a little,
83080	87040	but she'll still be here to provide her always insightful commentary, of course.
87040	88200	I've got some snark.
88200	90000	You just might, yes.
90000	93040	Being sick makes a person a little extra snarky, I find.
93040	94840	I am also a little sick.
94840	99800	Just now the E3 is coming up, I have this gift, I don't know what you want to call it,
99800	102560	where I tend to get sick at big gaming conventions.
102560	106400	It happened at PAX East earlier this year and now it's happening again for E3.
106400	107400	Hooray.
107400	111280	Well, also joining us tonight, say hello to the well and healthy, at least for now, Tech
111280	112280	Master Loki.
112280	115320	I am perfectly fine, except in my head.
115320	116620	I am sick in the head.
116620	118640	But that's why we love you here on Orange Lounge Radio.
118640	123040	Loki, which we're coming up on, if you can believe it, our eighth anniversary show in
123040	124040	a couple weeks.
124040	127740	But we've got to get through E3 before we get there.
127740	131920	Joining us tonight, this is a little bit special because in the eight year history of Orange
131920	136080	Lounge Radio, this guy used to come on the show quite a bit, but then kind of took a
136080	139640	break for a little while, because he moved to this place in the Midwest.
139640	141520	I don't know why anyone would want to do that.
141520	147200	But he's back tonight to say hello and try to get into E3 with us.
147200	149720	Say hello to the one and only Miklotov is here tonight.
149720	150720	Hello.
150720	151720	How are you doing?
151720	152720	I'm good.
152720	155320	Now, for those listeners who've never heard you here on the show before, give us like
155320	156320	a summary.
156320	157320	What do you do?
157320	161360	What have you been doing over the past eight years of video games here on the alarm?
161360	162360	Let's see.
162360	163360	Working.
163360	165520	I work at a video game store now.
165520	169280	So I went from working at a video game company to a video game store.
169280	171200	And for those who don't know, you used to work for?
171200	172200	Konami.
172200	173200	Yes.
173200	174200	And can you say what you did at Konami or was that a secret?
174200	175200	Yeah.
175200	179960	I did DDR and I made the steps and with, you know, the other people on the team.
179960	184480	And I did text stuff and yeah, that's what I did there.
184480	185480	Good times.
185480	189520	Oh, I got drunk because it was fun.
189520	191040	Is that why the games were crap?
191040	192040	You all were drinking.
192040	193040	I'm just kidding.
193040	194040	It might have been.
194040	199120	Actually, I will say UltraMix 2, which I know you guys worked on, was the best DDR game
199120	201160	that ever came out of the USA.
201160	202160	Probably.
202160	203160	Yeah.
203160	204160	Absolutely.
204160	205160	So, well, what happened?
205160	206160	Are you allowed to talk about what happened?
206160	207160	I don't know.
207160	208160	Maybe Supernova.
208160	209160	Supernova was really good.
209160	210160	Are you allowed to talk about what happened?
210160	211160	Why you no longer at Konami?
211160	212280	Oh, yeah.
212280	217240	They just moved and I didn't want to move because I didn't have a permanent quote unquote
217240	218240	position.
218240	222000	So I wasn't going to get paid to move down to where they moved their offices to.
222000	225720	So I decided time to leave.
225720	227720	And so you went back to where your family is, correct?
227720	228720	Yes.
228720	229720	Which is in the Midwest.
229720	230720	Yeah.
230720	231720	All right.
231720	232720	I agree.
232720	233720	I'm just kidding.
233720	234720	All right.
234720	235720	But things are good for you in Kansas.
235720	236720	Kansas treating you well?
236720	237720	Yeah.
237720	238720	Good enough.
238720	239720	Well, welcome back to the show.
239720	240720	I'm sure you haven't listened since the last time you've been on.
240720	241720	Like for the past three weeks.
241720	242720	Oh, that's right.
242720	243720	You've been commenting in chat and stuff.
243720	244720	Yeah.
244720	247160	The show's kind of different now than it was when you were first coming onto the show,
247160	248160	huh?
248160	252080	I don't know much about the music games anymore, but there aren't very many great music games
252080	253080	anymore.
253080	254080	So it's okay.
254080	255080	It makes sense.
255080	258640	For our new listeners, real quick, can you kind of define what did Orange Lawns Radio
258640	260600	used to be when you were first coming to this show?
260600	266280	Oh, it was like everybody didn't know what they were doing more so than now.
266280	269960	And it was like, let's talk about DDR for like an hour or two.
269960	270960	All right.
270960	271960	Bye.
271960	272960	That was it.
272960	273960	That's pretty much it.
273960	274960	You got it.
274960	275960	All right.
275960	276960	But we're still here.
276960	280680	We're still coming up and we're going to talk a lot about E3 tonight with Mikle Tov.
280680	285360	And speaking of which, we have big, big news coming out of the big cities tonight.
285360	287420	We're going to start off the show a little differently tonight.
287420	299280	We have an Orange Lawns Radio special report.
299280	300280	That's right.
300280	301880	We do have some big breaking news.
301880	307640	It does appear that Scarlett Johansson has won the Tony for best performance by a featured
307640	310200	actress in a play for A View From The Bridge.
310200	313120	Congratulations to Scarlett Johansson.
313120	314120	You hot bitch.
314120	315120	We all...
315120	316120	Okay.
316120	317120	E3.
317120	318120	Yeah.
318120	319120	No, there's some huge news coming out of E3.
319120	323280	Obviously, tonight is Microsoft's big reveal of Project Natal.
323280	324280	And they...
324280	325280	Not necessarily the press conference.
325280	326280	Yes.
326280	330080	It's not their press conference, but it's their Cirque du Soleil as imagined by Cirque
330080	336280	du Soleil or as one of my friends calls it Cirque du Soguet as Project Natal is being
336280	338560	reinvented or reimagined or whatever they're doing.
338560	340400	I like how Patton Oswalt describes it.
340400	341400	What does he describe it as?
341400	343640	It's French and gay and on fire.
343640	344840	That's pretty much what it is.
344840	350600	So Project Natal is French and gay and on fire and it is now called the Microsoft Connect.
350600	354160	And that's thanks to a report leaking out from USA Today.
354160	360400	It's Connect K-I-N-E-C-T, Microsoft Connect.
360400	363360	Kind of a play on the word kinetic, I guess you could say.
363360	367200	I think we'll hear a little more about that as word leaks out of tonight's event as well
367200	368520	as Monday's press conference.
368520	373440	However, did you know there will not be streaming of tonight's little special event because
373440	378160	there's been a block on it all because MTV has the exclusive rights to air it.
378160	381760	I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that one of the early games announced for
381760	385120	Microsoft Connect is coming from MTV Games.
385120	386760	Here it is, folks.
386760	388920	Dance Central.
388920	392480	And USA Today is calling it a So You Think You Can Dance experience home, although it's
392480	395800	not for sure if the brand name actually plays into it.
395800	396800	Probably not.
396800	400680	But if you want to tie in directly to last week's show, there's your Timberland Cascada
400680	402960	game and all those things we were talking about.
402960	405320	Did I say Timberland like a tree?
405320	406320	Timber...
406320	409240	Timberland and Cascada and all those things we were talking about last week.
409240	410240	That's gotta be it.
410240	411240	That's it.
411240	412240	Whatever.
412240	417400	So that's one of the early games coming out of the Kinetic.
417400	422360	Also announced, I'm sure to much surprise, Kinetic Sports!
422360	427280	With six activities, who knew, boxing, bowling, volleyball, track and field, soccer, and table
427280	428280	tennis.
428280	429280	Wow.
429280	430960	And the Vomitarium.
430960	431960	The Vomitarium?
431960	433680	That might be in Connect Adventures.
433680	436440	I'm sorry, hurling.
436440	441960	River Raft Time Trial, Obstacle Course, up to four players on the raft playing as a duo.
441960	445640	You and a partner lean one way or another to steer.
445640	449600	Also a game called Joyride, which was originally announced a little while ago, got pulled from
449600	451440	Xbox.com and then came back.
451440	452760	It's a racing game.
452760	455320	That's the one where you're going to hold the imaginary steering wheel and drive back
455320	456760	and forth.
456760	457760	Connectimals!
457760	463580	You train and play 20 different virtual cats, including a lion, a cheetah, and a tiger.
463580	466480	It's kind of like PokeCats, but with Connect.
466480	467960	I don't know what else to call that.
467960	472580	And lastly, and this is pretty big, Star Wars characters and Disney favorites will be featured
472580	478680	in separate new games being developed at Microsoft in conjunction with LucasArts and Disney.
478680	482680	So you know that whole Wii lightsaber game you've all been wanting for years and years?
482680	483680	Guess what?
483680	488640	Microsoft announces today, well inadvertently through USA Today, that Star Wars is actually
488640	489640	coming to Connect.
489640	493680	It's going to take me a little while to not say Natal anymore.
493680	496800	They should have just called the damn thing Natal, but that's alright.
496800	497800	Connect.
497800	500240	Quickly, what are your thoughts about the name Connect?
500240	503560	Loki, we'll start with you, because you always have something elegant to say.
503560	508160	No, what's funny is they have, what is it, that Microsoft phone that's kin.
508160	511080	That's kind of ironic if you think about it.
511080	512280	And that's what you think of the name?
512280	517680	No, I think the Connect...
517680	518680	It's alright.
518680	520080	It is Move and Wii.
520080	523000	I mean, I don't know.
523000	526360	It's slightly more original than Move.
526360	527360	The PlayStation Move.
527360	530040	I mean, that's just a really stupid name.
530040	531040	Dark Sakura?
531040	532040	Connect?
532040	535680	I played with Connects when I was a kid.
535680	537680	I played Connect 4 when I was a kid.
537680	540820	Miek Latov, what do you think of Connect?
540820	541820	It's dumb.
541820	543400	Why do you say it's dumb?
543400	544840	Because.
544840	545840	We know Natal.
545840	549680	You know, that sounds kind of cool, futuristic, what they're kind of going for.
549680	550680	Connect.
550680	551680	Really?
551680	555880	Yeah, but see, remember, we all love the revolution, and you know.
555880	557400	And the Wii is still a stupid name.
557400	559360	I'm not going to say it's not.
559360	560360	Let's go to the chatters.
560360	561360	Chat.orangelandtrady.com.
561360	562360	After all.
562360	563460	It's just a name.
563460	565480	It's the place where every gamer has a voice.
565480	569300	Sj100matt, you know we said the same thing when they came out with the Nintendo Revolution
569300	571320	before the Wii.
571320	575920	And I'm glad that they're coming out with this wonderful system, and they're totally
575920	578280	mimicking everything that's on the Wii already.
578280	579560	Okay, let's see.
579560	581160	We've got a game that's like Wii Sports.
581160	584720	We've got a game that's probably going to be like Wii Play.
584720	586880	And we've got a game that's just like Just Dance.
586880	589840	Oh, and we've got a game with Disney characters and Star Wars characters that will probably
589840	592080	be very similar to what's already on the Wii.
592080	593080	Just with slightly better graphics.
593080	595440	Oh, and we have a racing game with a fake wheel.
595440	596440	Ugh!
596440	603160	I mean, really, are we going to have the same shit on this stupid console?
603160	609400	Am I really going to pay the mythical $150 for this thing?
609400	610400	Fool me once, Microsoft!
610400	613880	I already bought your fucking camera, and it served me no purpose whatsoever.
613880	616880	Well, but you do get to use your picture as an icon.
616880	619320	Or, uh, gamer pic.
619320	620320	I don't care, that's the whole...
620320	621320	And Burnout!
621320	622320	The Burnout game.
622320	623320	Remember?
623320	624320	Oh, okay.
624320	628520	You get pictures of you when your car crashed, so you get pictures sent to strangers on the
628520	630400	internet where it looks like you're taking a poop.
630400	633560	Because you have these urgh faces.
633560	638560	Alright, more chatter comments, because boy, they're being eloquent tonight.
638560	639760	Bochi Kawa in our chatroom.
639760	642720	Chat.orangewandredo.com, by the way, if you want to join us here live on this Sunday night
642720	648240	as we tape at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
648240	650160	It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
650160	656720	Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says, connect just won't connect to the consumer.
656720	660640	This is their get, basically their grab for the Wii Market.
660640	664880	Problem is, people in the Wii Market have a Wii, and they're not going to buy another
664880	669560	console to play the same fucking games.
669560	671040	I buy everything.
671040	673080	Tiger Kawa in our chat, you're special.
673080	678040	Tiger Kawa in our chat says one of the other games will probably be Connect the Dots.
678040	681760	Baconbit says the name doesn't matter as long as it's fun.
681760	686160	And BowerCTU says I'll call it shit, not connect.
686160	687560	How about kashit?
687560	688560	Can we compromise here?
688560	689560	Bower, kashit.
689560	693600	Listen, it'll be alright, but the problem, see, what I don't like is the first generation
693600	694600	of games.
694600	697080	Because the first generation of games is going to be like, ooh, look at what we can do with
697080	698080	the hardware.
698080	701920	It's going to take a while before we get some actual unique stuff.
701920	705860	And I'm not counting Fable 3 as unique crap, ok, that game is going to be the same damn
705860	706860	game again.
706860	711320	This was some other fancy shit, ok.
711320	712320	That's my problem with it.
712320	716960	Really, I mean, it'll probably be a good peripheral.
716960	719560	It's just, it's going to take a while to get there.
719560	721560	Just like the Wii took a while to get there.
721560	726040	Alright, by the way, speaking of which, we got to razz Xbox over the name, I mean, I
726040	729720	hate if you want, but we did this with Nintendo when the Wii came out, I mean, how many Wii
729720	730720	jokes were made, right?
730720	731720	Wii!
731720	732720	And all that stuff, right?
732720	734080	Let's see, more stuff in chat.
734080	735080	I love this.
735080	741120	Jesus Poppin Chat says, when I hear and say Natal, I think Xbox motion accessory, but
741120	747640	whenever I see Microsoft NATAL in print, or Microsoft Natal in print, I think of ultrasounds,
747640	750280	folic acid vitamins, and diaper genies.
750280	752600	I can see that.
752600	756640	Tiger Class says, watch, they will have cheesy taglines like, connect to the web.
756640	760960	They should have just called it the kinetic, I mean, because that would have been kind
760960	761960	of neat.
761960	765280	It would have, it would have at least sounded kind of fancy and stuff.
765280	769200	And I give them points, they're like one step above move.
769200	772000	Because move is just like, oh, what should we call this, I don't know, it's a control
772000	773000	you move around with.
773000	774000	Ah!
774000	775000	Move!
775000	776000	Good.
776000	777000	Done.
777000	778000	They didn't even, like, think about a name.
778000	779960	Technus in our chat says, they might as well have named it Connect 3D, since 3D is the
779960	782280	new marketing term in the tech that it's based on.
782280	785960	SSG100 Matt says, the real question is, do they announce an Eye of Judgment game?
785960	789280	If so, do we care to make a bet on it?
789280	795240	And let's see, lastly, where were we at, oh yes, SSG100 Matt says, Connect, starring Jodie
795240	796240	Foster.
796240	799960	Spoiler alert, it's her father.
799960	800960	Get it?
800960	801960	That's funny.
801960	802960	I believe that's contact.
802960	803960	That's funny.
803960	804960	That's funny!
804960	806320	I would like to say that that USA Today article that mentions, it's like, so you think you
806320	807320	can dance?
807320	811580	If anything, it'd be like America's Best Dance Crew, because that's on MTV, since it is being
811580	812580	made by MTV.
812580	816080	But they probably don't want to use the name, because if it's a crappy game, it might bring
816080	817080	down the show.
817080	818080	That's true.
818080	819080	And that show's actually pretty cool.
819080	820080	Yeah.
820080	821080	So, so you think you can dance?
821080	823080	I love that show.
823080	827560	Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into a little bit of the normal flow of our show,
827560	830900	but we thought we'd interrupt there for the breaking Xbox news.
830900	833840	We will keep you posted if anything else breaks during the conference.
833840	836520	Or if we think of any other funny connect jokes.
836520	839760	Special events featuring Cirque de French Gay.
839760	843140	Alright, let's move on with, how was your gaming week and the type of stuff you played
843140	844140	this week?
844140	846280	That's how we usually start the show, but you know, I can't control when the special
846280	849840	bulletins are gonna, just like when you're trying to watch Soaps, and then all of a sudden,
849840	850840	dead celebrity.
850840	852480	It's like when you've got bad gas.
852480	853480	Yeah.
853480	854480	It just farts sometimes.
854480	855480	Yeah.
855480	857480	Maybe that'll be a game on Kinect.
857480	858480	Kinect fart.
858480	861680	Alright, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
861680	866640	It was okay, um, I played some Star Trek Online, I hit Commander finally.
866640	867640	Yay.
867640	871640	Um, I made a friend in Scotland.
871640	872640	Did you?
872640	873640	Yes.
873640	875640	If it's not Scottish, it's crap.
875640	883960	I played, um, and uh, I uh, I've been playing Sims 3 like I'm doing right now.
883960	885960	During the show.
885960	886960	It's slow.
886960	887960	During the show, well, what else is new?
887960	888960	No, it's, I know.
888960	889960	I know.
889960	892240	I'm not playing Star Trek Online during the show and eating bandwidth.
892240	893240	True.
893240	894440	I turned off Steam for the show, Rob.
894440	895440	I'm very happy you did that.
895440	898080	I was enamored with watching everyone's Steam updates.
898080	902440	Oh yeah, I played some Portal.
902440	905320	Especially since I got it free.
905320	906600	Free is good.
906600	907920	Free is very good.
907920	910680	Alrighty, uh, let's move on to Loki.
910680	912680	How was your gaming week, Loki?
912680	915160	Uh, same old stuff again.
915160	917680	Um, Grand Theft Auto.
917680	924000	Mainly, I've been playing, um, just the regular Deathmatch stuff, but we have been having
924000	928320	some really serious connection problems, thanks to our wonderful bandwidth at work.
928320	930920	Uh, Red Dead Redemption, more co-op than that.
930920	934480	I think I'm like level 20 something now, like 23.
934480	941280	And Earth Defense Force, where most of the way through the Inferno difficulty.
941280	944320	And it's, uh, major fun.
944320	947480	Um, what else?
947480	949660	That's pretty much it.
949660	960100	It's been mainly painting baby room and, um, you know, working on Grand Theft Auto IV editing.
960100	962840	It's Imagine Babies in real life, basically.
962840	964720	Well, it's game related.
964720	966240	The room is New Super Mario.
966240	969240	Actually, and I don't know if the pictures are public or whatever, but they're really
969240	970240	cute.
970240	973240	Like, a lot of the stuff that, um, you and the wife are doing are really cute.
973240	979400	Yeah, we got, um, big ol' stuffed animals of Koopas and, you know, the star and the
979400	982840	fire flower and, uh, stuff like that.
982840	987960	And then, of course, we have wall decals for the New Super Mario Brothers characters and
987960	991040	the bricks and question blocks and all that fun stuff.
991040	993520	So you totally took the idea of Dan and I wanted.
993520	994520	Sorry.
994520	996000	Because now we need a Halo room.
996000	998160	A Halo room for your baby?
998160	999160	Yeah.
999160	1000160	I hope we have a girl.
1000160	1001160	Nice.
1001160	1003280	Alright, uh, Miek LaTov, how was your gaming week?
1003280	1004280	What kind of games did you play this week?
1004280	1009320	It sucked because the one game I wanted to play, which was DJ Max Technica, we went to
1009320	1013920	go play it and it was the one game in the whole arcade that was not working.
1013920	1019840	That's even more of a surprise because only one game was not working.
1019840	1022280	And it was the best one, though, and it made me sad.
1022280	1024960	And I hate the people at Roseville Golf Land because they're idiots.
1024960	1027200	I hope they listen and know that they're dumb.
1027200	1032400	I loved it, too, because when Miek LaTov was kind of getting off the plane and he met Alan,
1032400	1035920	we went out to lunch when he first got here, because what was the first, what's the first
1035920	1037640	thing anyone wants to do when they come to California?
1037640	1040460	I was like, let's go eat and Miek LaTov wanted to go, too?
1040460	1041460	In and out.
1041460	1046920	Alright, so we went to In and Out and we were eating and Miek LaTov was like, I didn't come
1046920	1047920	here for E3.
1047920	1049180	I came here to play DJ Max Technica.
1049180	1050180	That's true.
1050180	1053800	So when we went to Roseville Golf Land last night and I looked and the machine was broken,
1053800	1054800	I couldn't help but laugh.
1054800	1056680	Like, it was really funny.
1056680	1058600	It was a really depressing moment in my life.
1058600	1060560	I mean, sad, but...
1060560	1064440	And then the people would not sell me Technica cards, which they had.
1064440	1066560	I had to go up there three times to get them.
1066560	1070800	Finally, the guy just said, okay, and he's like, you know, these don't work because the
1070800	1071800	machine doesn't work.
1071800	1076200	I'm like, I understand that, but I'm giving you money to give me these cards.
1076200	1077200	And they did.
1077200	1080680	And I hate, like, 16-year-olds that work at arcades.
1080680	1084880	Couple questions is Arcade Infinity still open and couldn't you guys go there during
1084880	1085880	your...
1085880	1086880	That's a backup plan.
1086880	1087880	Yes and yes.
1087880	1088880	That's already under discussion.
1088880	1093200	I'm actually going to call them and be like, so do you have a working Technica machine?
1093200	1094960	Because other places don't.
1094960	1095960	You should.
1095960	1098040	And there was also an idea we could go to Sunnyvale Golf Land.
1098040	1101160	We don't think we can make it work with the timing because I have a family thing Saturday
1101160	1102460	I have to go to.
1102460	1105680	And Sunnyvale has Sirius, too, which would be fun to play, but maybe Arcade Infinity
1105680	1108000	might as well, since they used to be up on that stuff.
1108000	1109000	Perhaps.
1109000	1110000	I don't know.
1110000	1111000	All right.
1111000	1112640	Aren't they, like, almost closing now or something?
1112640	1114600	Aren't they, like, one of those Save the Arcades?
1114600	1115600	Yeah.
1115600	1116600	Yeah.
1116600	1117600	Sadly.
1117600	1120080	Surezo in chat says, Rob, I was there when he was there.
1120080	1121080	Friday night.
1121080	1122080	Miklotov was at RVGL.
1122080	1123080	I met him.
1123080	1124080	Who?
1124080	1126000	Well, that's amazing because he was still in Kansas Friday night.
1126000	1127000	Yeah.
1127000	1128840	We both went on Saturday, actually.
1128840	1129840	That's so cool.
1129840	1133560	Like, it was me from the future, but in the past.
1133560	1136160	Unless he's getting his days mixed up, he could have been that guy, because there was
1136160	1138320	a guy playing BeatMania 2DX, who was pretty good.
1138320	1139320	Yeah.
1139320	1140320	I met Miklotov, too.
1140320	1141320	Hi.
1141320	1142320	Hi.
1142320	1144880	It's a first in a couple years.
1144880	1145880	All right.
1145880	1148600	Anything else you played this week you want to mention?
1148600	1154040	Oh, on the plane, I was playing DJ Max because it's, like, the only game I play anymore.
1154040	1158840	And this old lady was sitting, like, two seats next to me, away from me, because we had an
1158840	1163280	empty seat in the middle, and she kept watching me play it, and it was really creepy because
1163280	1166940	she was, like, really old, like, 60 or 70.
1166940	1171400	And then she's talked to me, and I was like, whatever, I just want to play my game.
1171400	1174280	But she enjoyed DJ Max, kind of, over your shoulder?
1174280	1177760	Or being a creepy, stalker-y, per- I don't know.
1177760	1178760	Old lady?
1178760	1179760	Old lady.
1179760	1180760	Yeah, that's what I said.
1180760	1181760	All right, there you go.
1181760	1182760	Creepy.
1182760	1183760	Did you have your first encounter with a cougar?
1183760	1184760	Come here, little boy.
1184760	1185760	I have some candy.
1185760	1188760	Oh, that is gross.
1188760	1190080	All right.
1190080	1192880	My gaming week, not quite as interesting as anyone else's.
1192880	1198240	Although I did go to a golf land with Mikolatov last night, and point laughed when the machine
1198240	1199240	was down.
1199240	1200240	Although, not really.
1200240	1201240	I actually thought that was kind of crap.
1201240	1202240	You did laugh, though.
1202240	1207680	I did laugh, but it was one of those, like, that fucking sucks, laugh, like, you know.
1207680	1210680	But I played BeatMania, what is it they have there?
1210680	1211680	Distorted.
1211680	1212800	What is that, 13, 14?
1212800	1213800	That's 13.
1213800	1214800	Whatever.
1214800	1215800	When the music stopped getting good.
1215800	1216800	Some teen.
1216800	1217800	Yeah, some teen.
1217800	1222200	So, but I played a bunch of old songs, and I can surprisingly still pass, like, level
1222200	1223200	seven and eight songs.
1223200	1224200	I beat Daisuke.
1224200	1225200	I was all like, woo!
1225200	1228040	It was like a 90, no, it was 94.
1228040	1230320	Daisuke was 90, wait, no, Thunder was 94.
1230320	1232120	Yeah, Thunder was 94.
1232120	1233120	Good times.
1233120	1234120	Old school.
1234120	1235120	All right.
1235120	1240480	Uh, let's see, um, Osefer in chat is asking a good question.
1240480	1242960	What happened to you playing Final Fantasy 13?
1242960	1246600	That still is the plan to beat games, but unfortunately I got a little sidetracked because
1246600	1247600	I've been playing WoW this week, too.
1247600	1250880	And then there's E3, and we've got to have work stuff going on, too.
1250880	1253880	Um, played, like, a little bit of Game Room and realized that nothing has been coming
1253880	1254880	out in the past couple weeks.
1254880	1256080	Oh, yeah, we played Game Room.
1256080	1257080	That's part of the game.
1257080	1259320	Like, when you were playing that space pig game.
1259320	1260320	It's Oink!
1260320	1261320	It's not space pigs.
1261320	1262320	Yes, it was.
1262320	1263320	It's a lizard.
1263320	1265320	It's a story based on the three little pigs.
1265320	1266780	It's pigs in space.
1266780	1268160	It's not pigs in space.
1268160	1272340	It's your captain, with your Doctor Strange pork.
1272340	1273880	It is not pigs in space.
1273880	1279040	They were up in a spaceship above the little, like, room you were in, and then the rat with
1279040	1280960	the long tongue kept trying to lick you.
1280960	1282320	That was the big, bad wolf.
1282320	1283380	He's blowing wind.
1283380	1285160	You had to imagine things a little bit better.
1285160	1290000	No, because if he's blowing wind, it wouldn't suck you in, too, because you don't, never
1290000	1291000	mind.
1291000	1292680	It was a mouse with a long tongue.
1292680	1293680	Alright.
1293680	1295800	And that was pretty much my gaming week.
1295800	1299960	Not a lot of exciting stuff outside of that, but, hey, on Black Wolf in Chat says, Oink
1299960	1300960	is awesome.
1300960	1302240	You all stop making fun of Oink right now.
1302240	1303880	I love Oink.
1303880	1307800	It's Miek Latov that is the hater.
1307800	1308800	Haters to the left.
1308800	1311440	Yeah, I don't hate it, but I do, because it's really dumb.
1311440	1312600	Shut up.
1312600	1316200	But then you watched me play, what, Keystone Capers, which was the cops and robbers one.
1316200	1318440	That was also stupid.
1318440	1320140	And then I made you play Stampede.
1320140	1321440	Which was also really dumb.
1321440	1325800	You were on, like, the squid, trying to hit the dogs with the little line that comes out
1325800	1326800	of your hand.
1326800	1330400	I think, actually, Miek Latov should have a show where he just, like, describes old
1330400	1333700	Atari 2600 games, because- Oh, and then that one game where you're, like,
1333700	1337800	that bee that you attack the little, like, wall, and there's that colory rainbow thing
1337800	1340720	in the middle, and you had to watch out for- What are you even talking about?
1340720	1343480	The one that was made by the dude that makes E.T.
1343480	1344480	Yars' Revenge.
1344480	1345800	Yes, that one.
1345800	1348160	I don't even know what he's talking about.
1348160	1351600	All right, we gotta move on with the show.
1351600	1355680	There's so much news tonight, it's really disgusting, so let's get to the show.
1355680	1360160	Housekeeping first, E3 overload this next week.
1360160	1364480	We will be coming to you, not live, but taped from E3, but the podcast will be up very quick.
1364480	1366700	I'm hoping we have reliable internet somewhere.
1366700	1370240	We're going to have to go to a Starbucks, I don't know, but there will be shows one
1370240	1373040	way or another, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night.
1373040	1378040	Rob Roberts and Pals from E3, so unfortunately, Dark Soccer and Loki are not going to E3,
1378040	1381600	so it's not really Orange Laundrio, but Rob Roberts and Pals will bring you some specials
1381600	1385360	to the feed, and of course, Miek Latov, one of my pals, will be there every night.
1385360	1390320	I'm hoping that Bobby Blackwolf and whatever other pals I find in LA will also be there,
1390320	1394500	so there'll be lots of feed updates this week, so make sure you are subscribed to our feed
1394500	1399720	in iTunes, or whatever your favorite little podcatcher program is, so you don't miss anything.
1399720	1402040	This is also very important during housekeeping.
1402040	1405320	I have a bad feeling this is going to get forgotten a little bit amongst all the E3
1405320	1408960	hype that's going on right now, but I do want to mention, we talked about this a little
1408960	1412980	bit last week, but it is official, Orange Lounge Radio and our listenership will be
1412980	1417040	participating in the All Games Big Battle, the Big Battle, and if you want more information,
1417040	1423360	go to bigbattle.allgames.com, and you can actually go there, you can sign up to represent
1423360	1428000	Team Orange Lounge Radio, because this isn't about host vs host, this is listener vs listener,
1428000	1432400	and there are several teams, I'm sorry, several different competitions that you're going to
1432400	1433400	be able to do.
1433400	1438200	I know one of them was Pinball, those are the recently announced ones, those were just
1438200	1444520	announced a little earlier this week, where you can actually play either Zen Pinball on
1444520	1450880	the PS3, or the, what is it, Pinball FX on the 360.
1450880	1452640	Those games will be a part of this.
1452640	1457120	So Soldner X2, there's competition for that, and there is going to be a live competition
1457120	1460480	on June 26th, Battlefield Bad Company 2.
1460480	1464980	All that information is at bigbattle.allgames.com.
1464980	1470080	We will bring you a little more information on that this next week, after E3 settles down
1470080	1471080	a little bit.
1471080	1475480	The first competition I believe ends is the Soldner X2 one, and it ends on the 26th, so
1475480	1476480	we have a little time.
1476480	1480120	But if you want to get the jump on these competitions, go check it out, especially the Pinball ones.
1480120	1482460	I know we have some listeners that are good at Pinball.
1482460	1486920	There is no reason the Orange Lounge Radio should not destroy all of the other shows
1486920	1489160	participating in at least Pinball.
1489160	1492520	And Pinball is 2, there's 2, there's Pinball FX and Zen Pinball.
1492520	1494760	So we should have at least half these competitions right out the gate.
1494760	1498840	It got me excited there because I was reading this all of a sudden, it said, for PS3, Zen
1498840	1499840	Pinball, Earth Defense Force.
1499840	1503040	I'm like, ooh, Earth Defense Force, I will win at that.
1503040	1505520	But no, unfortunately it's not.
1505520	1509720	I am trying to get Derek to put Grand Theft Auto IV as one of the games.
1509720	1510720	But we'll see.
1510720	1513880	It would be kind of tough, and it has to be Episodes of Liberty City because that's a
1513880	1514880	better game.
1514880	1515880	We'll see, we'll see.
1515880	1521400	Alright, we'll talk more about that next week, not to belittle the importance of the event,
1521400	1524420	but just with E3 going on, I just think everybody's going to forget.
1524420	1528320	It's going to get kind of lost amongst all the E3 madness, but we will be kind of giving
1528320	1531640	you regular updates on what's going on there starting next week.
1531640	1537520	So again, sign up now, get the jump on everything, read all about it, bigbattle.allgames.com.
1537520	1540600	Let's see, what else is going on right now that I want to tell you guys about?
1540600	1544960	The anniversary show for Orange Lounge Radio is coming up in two weeks, so next Sunday
1544960	1549600	we will be live, it's our post-E3 show, then we will be here for the anniversary show of
1549600	1555680	Orange Lounge Radio, which will be on the 2014 days from tonight, so the 27th, and then
1555680	1557440	after that is July 4th.
1557440	1563680	We will not be live on July 4th due to the holiday, people want to go set things on fire
1563680	1565680	instead of sitting here on the radio.
1565680	1570240	Yes, so we will not be here July 4th, but that's okay, because it's going to be a busy
1570240	1571240	busy busy next few weeks.
1571240	1573120	We will have beer and exploding things.
1573120	1577440	Alright, let's, I guess, let's get into some gaming news.
1577440	1582600	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Twitter.com slash OLR, add us, follow us on the net,
1582600	1586040	visit our website and all the great articles that have been written by our listeners, it's
1586040	1589040	so great, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1589040	1591160	Let's get into some actual, what?
1591160	1592680	Don't forget Geek Life.
1592680	1599040	Yes, Geek-Life.com, our BFF website, who I will be doing my first story for next week.
1599040	1600200	What could it possibly be about?
1600200	1601680	I don't know.
1601680	1607520	I have my regular segment on there, which is Geek Cube, integrating your geek life with
1607520	1608520	your office life.
1608520	1609520	Good times.
1609520	1610520	Very geeky.
1610520	1613920	Alright, Dark Sakura is going to start us tonight with, start us off tonight with some
1613920	1614920	gaming news.
1614920	1616040	What's up, Dark Sakura?
1616040	1620760	Keytar Hero, I mean, Rock Band 3.
1620760	1627520	The Keytar is official for Rock Band 3, it is going to be either something you can play
1627520	1631640	as a horizontal keyboard or over the shoulder, it has like this little handle, you know,
1631640	1638520	very keytar-like, and it looks like a two-octave keyboard, it looks very keyboard mania-like.
1638520	1640400	25 keys, I think.
1640400	1641800	Yeah, two octave.
1641800	1646600	Yay, it's not a keytar, yay, yay, yay, I mean, you could stand it upright and it could be
1646600	1652040	a guitar, but it's an actual bonafide keyboard, I love you, harmonics.
1652040	1655240	So yeah, there's that in the hyper guitar.
1655240	1658320	Did you see that thing?
1658320	1659320	The hyper guitar.
1659320	1660960	What is that, like the 120-button one?
1660960	1662760	The 120 fret with strings.
1662760	1665840	Well, now they want to teach you how to really play.
1665840	1667280	But I kind of want it.
1667280	1672040	You know what, I didn't care about any of it, because keyboards, and Bohemian Rhapsody,
1672040	1675960	and the cool thing is, if you play in pro mode, and you play the expert level, and if
1675960	1681240	you can memorize what you're doing, you will be able to play the actual, real song.
1681240	1682240	That is the great thing about this.
1682240	1683240	In two octaves.
1683240	1684240	Yes.
1684240	1687640	The only thing that I thought was a little weird was when you look at the video, the
1687640	1691680	pro mode note chart kind of scrolls to the right and to the left.
1691680	1693360	You don't see it all on the screen at once.
1693360	1694760	I think that's actually kind of cool.
1694760	1698080	I think it's supposed to tell you when to move your hands around.
1698080	1702120	I think that's what the point is, but I'm a little apprehensive about it.
1702120	1706860	Well, it's limited screen space is basically it, because you can't have like 25 rows on
1706860	1712360	there at one time, so what they do is, as the song shifts octaves or whatever, it will
1712360	1714560	scroll over.
1714560	1715560	Which is fine by me.
1715560	1716560	It looks pretty awesome.
1716560	1720280	I was wondering how they'd be able to pull it off, and it looks like you can do it.
1720280	1724560	Now, what I want to see is how the hell they're going to do the guitar part of the pro mode,
1724560	1728480	because that's going to be weird.
1728480	1731040	You know, Tigerclaw is in our chat right now, and he said the same thing.
1731040	1734220	I was just thinking, Sky, it's an actual keyboard you can plug into your computer and use as
1734220	1735220	a MIDI keyboard.
1735220	1738440	That just makes it like 10 times more awesome.
1738440	1739600	More awesomer.
1739600	1746360	And you can actually get a MIDI adapter to plug into any MIDI guitars, drums, or keyboards
1746360	1750560	that you may have as well, and use those in Rock Band.
1750560	1753960	So what do you guys think of Rock Band 3 so far from this news we're hearing?
1753960	1756560	Keytar Hero.
1756560	1757560	I am so excited.
1757560	1760780	Bohemian Rhapsody and Power of Love.
1760780	1762080	There were some other songs they announced too.
1762080	1765240	I don't have the whole list in front of me, but it looks like it's going to be a pretty
1765240	1766240	solid list.
1766240	1769720	Lots of newer stuff, but some of the old stuff too for fun.
1769720	1774720	Alright, we're going to get to our next news story, but first, guys, I can't control tonight.
1774720	1786600	There is just so much breaking news!
1786600	1790760	The Tony for Best Mute, no I'm kidding, actually we're going to go to Miek Latov with a special
1790760	1791760	report.
1791760	1798080	Um, yeah, apparently those rumors about a new 360 appear true.
1798080	1804280	It looks like they are redesigning the 360, and it will come with a 250GB hard drive,
1804280	1810480	but most importantly, built-in Wi-Fi, so you don't have to pay $100 to be able to connect
1810480	1814020	to the internet if you don't have a very long ethernet cable.
1814020	1817200	And it comes with a fork and a knife and a clock and a pillow.
1817200	1819360	That would be great, actually.
1819360	1821800	Then you could sleep on your 360.
1821800	1823280	No name for this yet, though, right?
1823280	1824280	No, and...
1824280	1825280	Like, foreign ads?
1825280	1826280	This is all leaking from foreign...
1826280	1828520	Yeah, they're Italian, it looks like.
1828520	1833960	Can we trust the Italians, I don't know.
1833960	1835960	They're dirty.
1835960	1836960	But it looks really cool.
1836960	1841040	It's very sleek, not so much slim.
1841040	1844360	And it looks like it could poke your eye out, because it's also very pointy.
1844360	1848560	They also changed, of course, since it is going to be slimmer, very similar to what
1848560	1855020	they were showing in those leaked motherboard development unit pictures.
1855020	1859000	It's basically now going to be all integrated into one chip instead of having a separate
1859000	1864520	GPU, CPU, and they're going to have the ventilation on it cooling straight out above the chip
1864520	1867660	instead of going through this ductwork that they had in there.
1867660	1868760	So that's kind of neat.
1868760	1872800	I do want to tell you guys, I guarantee you it is not called the 360 Slim.
1872800	1876560	It's only being called that because we're used to this kind of redesign thing from Sony's
1876560	1877560	end.
1877560	1878560	It's not called the Slim.
1878560	1881680	Microsoft will call this something else, which we'll hear tomorrow.
1881680	1882680	The 360 Cinched.
1882680	1883680	Yes.
1883680	1884680	That's what it looks like.
1884680	1887040	The 360 Slightly Smaller.
1887040	1888040	Or the 180.
1888040	1889040	Connect.
1889040	1891560	It might not even get a new name, though.
1891560	1896640	I mean, you can come out with a new system design and still call it the same thing.
1896640	1897640	That's true.
1897640	1898640	They might just call it the Xbox 360.
1898640	1899640	It might just...
1899640	1903400	When they redesigned the old, old Nintendo to be top-loading or whatever, it didn't have
1903400	1904400	a different design.
1904400	1905400	Or a different name.
1905400	1909960	We've already heard about the fact that Microsoft kind of wants to reboot the system and include
1909960	1915200	Natal, excuse me, Kinect, as a part of the new system.
1915200	1916200	Guarantee it.
1916200	1919960	There will be bundles on the shelves this Christmas with the pointy 360 with Wi-Fi and
1919960	1925360	Kinect all in one box with Kinect Sports or Kinect Kitties or whatever that game was.
1925360	1931160	One of those BS games all together for the low, low price of $250, we'll say.
1931160	1932160	Let's hope.
1932160	1933160	$300, I bet you.
1933160	1934160	$300?
1934160	1936880	That sounds more realistic, perhaps.
1936880	1940160	And then they'll also sell Netflix or whatever else they're going to announce tomorrow, whether
1940160	1942480	it be Hulu or anything else.
1942480	1943480	So we'll see.
1943480	1944480	All right.
1944480	1945480	Let's get back into the regular news.
1945480	1946980	Thank you for that special report, Miklotov.
1946980	1947980	We should...
1947980	1949320	We're going to need you to...
1949320	1950400	Maybe we should have you.
1950400	1952000	I mean, I know you're in Kansas.
1952000	1953640	Do they have internet there?
1953640	1957200	I have a tin can I hook up to my computer.
1957200	1958200	I see.
1958200	1960800	Well, the tornadoes aren't blaring, right?
1960800	1961800	Tornadoes don't blare.
1961800	1962800	That's the sirens that blare.
1962800	1963800	Tornadoes spin.
1963800	1964800	They're coming.
1964800	1965800	Okay.
1965800	1967760	So if the tornado doesn't knock out your connection, you might have to call us once in a while
1967760	1968760	with your breaking news.
1968760	1969760	With my breaking news?
1969760	1970760	Yes.
1970760	1974600	I'll be like, I just played a retro game on Xbox Live Game Room.
1974600	1976320	It was stupid.
1976320	1977320	Breaking news.
1977320	1978320	Yes.
1978320	1979320	Actually, I can...
1979320	1981560	Let's fast forward to next week or next week.
1981560	1994520	Miklotov will call in live to the show and it will go something like this.
1994520	1995520	Yes.
1995520	2000760	It looks like that Miklotov is calling into the show.
2000760	2002960	He's calling in with some breaking news.
2002960	2007920	Let's go live to Miklotov and see what is going on in gaming news.
2007920	2008920	Miklotov.
2008920	2021680	I'm sorry, apparently there's been a takeover of our feed from Understation Live.
2021680	2025600	I don't know what that is all about, but that just wasn't funny.
2025600	2026600	All right.
2026600	2027600	Let's move on.
2027600	2030560	Loki, do you have some gaming news for us?
2030560	2031560	Yes.
2031560	2035000	It's regarding rumors about the 3DS.
2035000	2038880	Apparently there's reports out saying that the system is more powerful than the Wii,
2038880	2044160	and unlike it was previously thought, it will not be using the new Nvidia chips.
2044160	2049960	Apparently, both IGN and Eurogamer have been reporting that developers have set off the
2049960	2053600	record, which is funny because they're reporting on it, so if it was off the record wouldn't
2053600	2058880	it be not reported on because that would be on the record.
2058880	2062440	That the handheld won't use the Nvidia Tegra chip.
2062440	2069120	Also Eurogamer is saying that the 3DS hardware is internally known as CTR, suggesting that
2069120	2073960	the motherboard image submitted to the FCC in May, which showed CTR as a code name, was
2073960	2074960	indeed the 3DS.
2074960	2079960	One of the things that's kind of interesting, Kotaku, I know, posted a mock-up of what they
2079960	2084140	thought the 3DS would look like based off of what they saw on the hardware thing.
2084140	2088260	It's funny that they didn't really pick up on the analog nub that was on there since
2088260	2092080	it looks exactly like the analog nub on the PSP.
2092080	2094880	But yes, it will have an analog nub on there.
2094880	2100480	Of course, the top screen's gonna be a widescreen, bottom screen not widescreen.
2100480	2107000	Of course, they're gonna have some sort of toggle on there to adjust how much 3D is on
2107000	2108000	there, I guess.
2108000	2113600	You can adjust, I guess, the depth field or whatever.
2113600	2117920	And according to IGN also, they're saying that several developers have experienced 3DS
2117920	2122240	in its current form and have reported off the record that its processing capabilities
2122240	2127480	far exceed the Nintendo Wii and bring the device up with abilities that are close to
2127480	2130960	the HD console, such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2130960	2135660	If that's the case, thank God Nintendo, you finally did something right and actually put
2135660	2141160	out a console that has better tech than what's already out there instead of saying, well,
2141160	2144080	it's not gonna be about technology, it's gonna be about the gameplay.
2144080	2145080	Because guess what?
2145080	2146080	Now the gameplay's all the same.
2146080	2148840	So it's gotta be about the tech now.
2148840	2152960	Now it's gonna be kind of weird to see what the Wii's gonna do with all these new motion
2152960	2156680	controllers and stuff like that now that, you know, they're kind of on an even playing
2156680	2158680	field.
2158680	2165680	It kind of intrigues me that a handheld system could possibly be as powerful as some of the
2165680	2166680	stuff that's in our living room.
2166680	2167800	I mean, it makes sense.
2167800	2175060	The technology, I mean, this cycle of video games really has lasted longer than I think
2175060	2176560	a lot of people have expected it to.
2176560	2180480	And you remember they came out and said, PlayStation 3's gonna have a 10-year life cycle, 360's
2180480	2182080	gonna have these long life cycles.
2182080	2185680	And it seems to really be happening because usually we should be hearing about new consoles
2185680	2188180	this year at E3, but that's not gonna happen.
2188180	2192000	And I don't know if you wanna blame the economy or the investment on these or what, I don't
2192000	2193000	really know.
2193000	2198140	But the point is, you know, these consoles are still there and the technology's a little
2198140	2199140	bit old.
2199140	2202680	It's interesting to me, though, that now the handhelds have already caught up because I
2202680	2207120	think a lot of us also kind of think, oh, well, Nintendo, let's see, the Advance was
2207120	2211440	basically a Super Nintendo, the DS was basically a Nintendo 64.
2211440	2216960	So logically, the next system is basically a GameCube, and then again, the Wii is also
2216960	2220360	kind of basically a GameCube, isn't it?
2220360	2223400	And they also usually do improve it like a little bit, right?
2223400	2226080	Am I crazy?
2226080	2228520	They kind of like, you know, it would be improved like a little bit.
2228520	2233320	Like, the DS felt like a little more than just a Nintendo 64, is it just me?
2233320	2237360	But they need a new gimmick because, I mean, if you wanna play touch screen games now,
2237360	2241360	you mean you have the iPhone, you have the iPad?
2241360	2248760	You know, it's not really any more, I mean, they're not the unique game system out there
2248760	2249760	anymore.
2249760	2255760	And now, with, you know, this new system, now that they have 3D, no other system's doing
2255760	2261000	that right now unless, you know, PlayStation announces a new PSP, which will be 3D as well,
2261000	2263280	because I'm sure that they will try to do something like that.
2263280	2267680	And it'll be digital downloads only, because it's an experiment.
2267680	2269000	We'll get to that in a little bit.
2269000	2272140	Let's do some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
2272140	2276280	Jay Dizzle wants you all to know he's connecting on the toilet right now.
2276280	2280760	Tigerclaw says, you know, don't be surprised if Sony announces the PSP2 with 3D support
2280760	2284640	if you buy the 3D add-on glasses, which will probably be their way to counter the 3DS.
2284640	2285960	Hm, I don't know.
2285960	2286960	S.H.G.O.
2286960	2288600	100 Matt says, so this is a confirmed rumor?
2288600	2292320	Stop talking to us in riddles and oxymorons, dammit!
2292320	2295480	Bochikawa says, this might be a good move for Nintendo, putting their cards in the mobile
2295480	2299380	market and selling the Wii or predecessors to soccer moms and six-year-olds.
2299380	2301740	It's actually really not a bad strategy.
2301740	2303560	It's been working for them so far.
2303560	2304560	Why not?
2304560	2305560	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
2305560	2311480	Here's my problem, and you're gonna hate this, but my problem with Nintendo is I don't think
2311480	2315320	they know how to deal with new hardware as far as, like, advanced stuff, because if you
2315320	2319640	notice, you know, what were some of the games that we got when the Wii came out?
2319640	2320640	GameCube ports.
2320640	2324600	You know, what are some of the games that we got on, you know, the Nintendo DS, basically
2324600	2328720	ports of stuff that was on Nintendo 64 and that kind of stuff?
2328720	2329720	Are they really gonna-
2329720	2331960	See, I was about to jump in there and say, but OMG, the Zelda game!
2331960	2332960	It was amazing!
2332960	2335600	And then, oh yeah, there was a GameCube version of that.
2335600	2336600	Exactly!
2336600	2340440	It was a GameCube port, and, you know, granted they're gonna have this wonderful new shiny
2340440	2345440	hardware and they're gonna be able to do really amazing stuff, but it won't come right away.
2345440	2348560	It's gonna be, oh look, we were working on this game for the DS, but now that we have
2348560	2352360	the 3DS, you know, let's just port it over and it'll be in 3D, but the graphics will
2352360	2353360	be really simple.
2353360	2356240	I have a crazy thought.
2356240	2358160	Really crazy- super crazy thought, you guys.
2358160	2359720	Here's my crazy thought.
2359720	2363260	We know that there's a new Zelda game that's supposed to be coming at E3 this year, right?
2363260	2365440	And that it's supposed to be, like, a better looking type of game.
2365440	2368720	It's gonna be, you know, kind of specially designed and da da da da, it's gonna be Uber
2368720	2370160	and all that stuff.
2370160	2372880	What if the Zelda game is actually a 3DS game?
2372880	2377040	Well, I'm sure they will have a 3DS Zelda game, but I think it's actually gonna be on
2377040	2378040	the Wii.
2378040	2379040	Right.
2379040	2383640	I'm most worried about the screen size now, the rumored screen size to be the size of
2383640	2388680	the, like, DSi screens, because I picked up an XL because I'm a Nintendo horror, at least
2388680	2391880	in the handheld sense, and I can't go back.
2391880	2397560	I mean, that screen really does not lose that much resolution in my opinion, and it'd be
2397560	2400240	really nice to have another system with screens that big.
2400240	2404360	I wanna point out, too, Miklotov is actually in the studio right now wearing a 1UP beanie,
2404360	2405360	so he's not lying.
2405360	2409120	And I'm not talking about that website, I'm talking about the actual 1UP mushroom.
2409120	2410120	Yes.
2410120	2411120	There it is.
2411120	2412120	Very nice.
2412120	2417240	Speaking of rumored games that are coming out for the 3DS, Destructoid has ran a story.
2417240	2421360	According to their sources, they strongly believe that Nintendo has been getting the
2421360	2426960	developers and publishers over with the 3D demo of Animal Crossing, apparently as an
2426960	2430920	internal demo that they're showing off to developers to try and get people over, that
2430920	2434960	that is the game that's supposed to be revealed this next week as a launch title for the Nintendo
2434960	2436440	3DS.
2436440	2440800	Nintendo went back into a corner and said, uh, comment on this, dammit, has said, Nintendo
2440800	2442480	does not comment on rumors or speculation.
2442480	2446080	Listen, Nintendo, if you're putting out another Animal Crossing game, I'm not fucking buying
2446080	2447080	it.
2447080	2448080	You know why?
2448080	2450400	It's because the last two games you've put out have been exactly the same as the first
2450400	2452680	one except with less features.
2452680	2456040	So go fuck yourself with your fucking Animal Crossing, because I am-
2456040	2460480	What if, hold on, anger, angry man, angry man sitting over there in the chair.
2460480	2461480	Hold on.
2461480	2464880	What if they've actually made changes?
2464880	2465880	They won't.
2465880	2468400	They've actually made changes.
2468400	2479160	What if, what if, stay with me here, hell had ice in it, and if you would put it kindly,
2479160	2481160	froze over.
2481160	2486760	Especially if you read the Inferno, the core of hell is icy.
2486760	2491920	Yes but the hell that Nintendo's familiar with, you know, does not have ice in it.
2491920	2498360	Um, no, I'm sorry, I, the only thing I can see them doing is adding 3D to it.
2498360	2501980	It's really gonna be the same fucking game all over again.
2501980	2502980	They might add a new fruit.
2502980	2503980	Oh, there you go.
2503980	2504980	A new fruit!
2504980	2505980	That would make people buy it.
2505980	2509240	And then they take out, like, your villagers and put them in the city now because, you
2509240	2510240	know, that's-
2510240	2516320	What if, wait, what if, what if, what if, stay with me here, what if, what if they gave
2516320	2519280	the animals machine guns?
2519280	2521440	Never forget.
2521440	2523080	They will never give them machine guns.
2523080	2525480	They'll give them squirt guns.
2525480	2526480	Paintball.
2526480	2532160	That, you know, set, paintball would be cool.
2532160	2535120	Question, question, question, question, question.
2535120	2539600	What was the best part about Animal Crossing when you would play it for the first time?
2539600	2543320	Hitting the, the people with, like, the net.
2543320	2545760	Terrorizing the animals in your village, correct?
2545760	2548600	Digging holes around them so they couldn't move.
2548600	2549600	Exactly.
2549600	2557640	What if Nintendo made a game that was nothing but terrorizing your villagers in Animal Crossing?
2557640	2559600	So they're gonna bring the Sims to the DS?
2559600	2562640	And they'll walk out and they'll walk back in their house.
2562640	2565080	Like, I, I realize, and you know what Dark Soccer used to do?
2565080	2567480	She would make gay pride flags and put them outside of people's houses.
2567480	2570720	Because I had a lesbian in my town.
2570720	2577120	I had, I had the, the chick that was the, had the PE room, the, the, was she a duck?
2577120	2578120	I don't know.
2578120	2579120	Or something.
2579120	2580120	I get it, they just replaced, like, a letter.
2580120	2587760	But, but she, but she was, but she was wearing sweats and had PE equipment and we, and she
2587760	2590160	would ask questions that could be taken the wrong way.
2590160	2595200	So we put a big rainbow sign outside of her house and she was her town lesbian and then
2595200	2596200	she moved to Rocktown.
2596200	2598480	Hold on, hold on, this is great.
2598480	2602080	Give me a gold star stat, because a chatter just won a gold star here.
2602080	2604240	Give me a gold star stat for this comment.
2604240	2609000	BowerCTU says, Animal Double Crossing.
2609000	2610000	Love it.
2610000	2611000	Love it!
2611000	2613040	Reggie, you listening?
2613040	2617840	They seriously need to redesign the game, I mean, and stop being so damn stingy with
2617840	2621080	your fucking virtual console crap or, you know, your Nintendo classics.
2621080	2622840	Put them in there.
2622840	2623840	Come on.
2623840	2625360	You're not selling them on the market.
2625360	2627480	Yeah, well, you might with the 3DS.
2627480	2629480	Oh, stay tuned.
2629480	2630480	You know.
2630480	2632880	That's what we thought with the I, and that never happened.
2632880	2634680	So I mean, come on.
2634680	2637560	It's not gonna steal away sales from the Wii.
2637560	2639280	It's just gonna be really kick-ass.
2639280	2640760	And you know what you can do?
2640760	2645120	You can sell your wonderful virtual console games as downloadable, you know, content for
2645120	2647240	Animal Crossing.
2647240	2654800	There's a thought, but it would be a creative thought and embracing digital content and
2654800	2655800	online.
2655800	2657240	Something Nintendo does not do.
2657240	2659760	It's the scariest thing in the world to them.
2659760	2663440	This is gonna be an interesting E3.
2663440	2664920	Everybody's kinda punchy in studio tonight.
2664920	2665920	I kinda like this.
2665920	2666920	It's fun.
2666920	2669680	God, just think about the show.
2669680	2673360	Alright, more news.
2673360	2675640	I'm done with this 3DS thing until I get to see it.
2675640	2681240	I will say, the plan right now in quotes, unless something like super awesome is revealed
2681240	2684120	in the next couple days that we decide we have to see on the show floor.
2684120	2687400	Miklotov and I plan to go run and see the 3DS first.
2687400	2688400	I won't run.
2688400	2689600	I might walk a little fast.
2689600	2691620	We'll walk at an accelerated pace.
2691620	2692880	I'm kinda old.
2692880	2700480	So we'll walk with a cane at an accelerated pace towards the 3DS line over at Nintendo.
2700480	2703760	Because the thought is, everybody's still gonna be at Sony's press conference.
2703760	2705580	So we wanna do the 3DS thing first.
2705580	2709080	So we're hoping that'll be on the first show Tuesday night, Rob Roberts and Pals.
2709080	2711360	Alright, Loki, let's do something besides the 3DS.
2711360	2713360	What you got for us?
2713360	2715960	Well, let's see.
2715960	2720480	The PSP Go apparently was an experiment, according to Sony.
2720480	2728280	They're claiming that the experiment, or one of the reasons that they launched the PSP
2728280	2733840	Go, was to understand where consumer behavior was going.
2733840	2738440	We were getting signals from consumers that this was the kind of device that they wanted.
2738440	2746780	But we need to recognize that the consumers like packaged media.
2746780	2751000	That sounds like a poor excuse for the reason why your console failed.
2751000	2757600	Not because your console was, I don't know, $80 more than, say, the same console that
2757600	2765440	had media already, basically had all the same features, except the ability to actually buy
2765440	2770740	disc-based games and be able to sell those games back when you're done with them.
2770740	2775920	If you really wanted to know where your consumer behavior was, put out a fucking survey!
2775920	2779720	You don't need to create a new console.
2779720	2782760	It was a failure, and that's what it was.
2782760	2786320	You're not calling it an experiment, it was a failure.
2786320	2789280	Huh.
2789280	2793280	I don't know, it's just kind of one of those, like, boy, they ran away with their tail between
2793280	2794280	its legs.
2794280	2799440	That's it, is this kind of like an official confirmation, you think, of the fact that
2799440	2802080	it's a done deal and the PSP Go is no longer going to be sold?
2802080	2803540	I mean, what's the deal?
2803540	2804540	I don't know.
2804540	2805880	Have you heard anything about this getting pulled from Shells?
2805880	2808520	No, I haven't heard anything, but let me put it this way, I mean, they haven't really been
2808520	2810840	selling like hotcakes, I mean, at all.
2810840	2812200	I mean, what do you expect?
2812200	2817500	You're putting out a console to your retailers and you're saying, oh, by the way, your customers
2817500	2821920	aren't going to be able to buy any sort of software for this from you, so.
2821920	2824800	But you can sell our console for us, oh, by the way, you're not going to make any money
2824800	2829880	off those consoles because consoles have no markup whatsoever, so yeah, go ahead and sell
2829880	2834920	this for no sort of profit whatsoever and then you're not going to profit for it later
2834920	2835920	on.
2835920	2840640	Most consumers or retailers out there are going to go, uh, how about fuck you and I'm
2840640	2844520	just going to carry the regular PSP where I can sell the same games.
2844520	2850560	And by the way, not all the games were available digitally right away anyways, so what's the
2850560	2852120	point?
2852120	2854240	And that's the problem is they pissed everybody off.
2854240	2859240	It was also more expensive than the PSP was, which made no fucking sense whatsoever.
2859240	2865940	Um, so it was just a bad, bad plan altogether.
2865940	2870840	You should have charged less for it since it didn't have, you know, UMD drive and it
2870840	2873360	would have gotten people to actually maybe pick it up.
2873360	2877040	But there's really absolutely, or actually there was absolutely no reason whatsoever
2877040	2882560	to pick up a PSP Go because you could just buy a PSP 3000 and a memory unit and have
2882560	2887760	basically the exact same thing and the flexibility to either buy your games on disk or buy them
2887760	2889760	via digital download.
2889760	2894800	Oh, I missed all the PSP hate and I hate it too, the Go.
2894800	2896360	Um, I thought it was dumb.
2896360	2898880	Uh, I'll share a quick little story.
2898880	2904360	At the store I work at, which I'm sure I can't name or get fired, um, we have sold, I kid
2904360	2908640	you not, since the system came out, three.
2908640	2909760	Just three.
2909760	2914960	And I talked everybody that I could out of it because, I mean, like you're saying, a
2914960	2919000	PSP 3000 with a, you know, a decent sized memory stick.
2919000	2922240	Just as good and way better actually than the Go could ever be.
2922240	2926680	Well, you know, if you buy the Sony memory sticks then maybe it might be somewhat of
2926680	2930480	a good deal, but since everybody doesn't, you know, double the retail price of their
2930480	2934560	memory units, um, you could go buy a third party SanDisk memory stick and it'd be just
2934560	2940760	fine, uh, and that's assuming if you wanted to download all your damn games, which most
2940760	2945200	people are not gonna do that because you can buy a PSP game on disk and when you're done
2945200	2946560	with it, guess what?
2946560	2950160	You could sell it and make your money back.
2950160	2954120	Don't forget about our friend who has had all the trouble with his downloads too.
2954120	2958360	Yeah, I have no problem with those digital download games that are only available via
2958360	2963080	digital download, but guess what, the PSP 3000, you can also download those.
2963080	2967720	Um, they just were trying to make it seem like that the PSP Go was the only system able
2967720	2971520	to access this marketplace and the problem was they were trying to, you know, basically
2971520	2975720	compete with like the iPhone or something like that, but you kind of have to have those
2975720	2982720	types of features in there like GPS and, you know, an actual phone, um, you know, all that
2982720	2985080	stuff to be able to compete in that market.
2985080	2988340	You didn't, so why even try putting on a new damn console anyways?
2988340	2993200	If you haven't improved anything, in fact, actually removed functionality out of it.
2993200	2994720	Have you ever actually held one?
2994720	2995720	No.
2995720	2998860	Okay, they feel like plastic little toys.
2998860	3000000	They are awful.
3000000	3001520	You feel like you're gonna break it.
3001520	3004120	Just that top screen alone does not feel very secure.
3004120	3009160	So when you're sliding it up and down, I can only imagine that it won't last, like it will
3009160	3010160	break.
3010160	3016000	Um, quickly, kind of one big rumor, big, big rumor that's floating around about what we're
3016000	3021000	gonna hear in a couple days, namely Tuesday morning when Sony does their press conference,
3021000	3022880	we may hear something about a PSP 2.
3022880	3025160	Do you think there's any truth to that rumor?
3025160	3030000	I think if it's gonna come out, it's gonna come out probably around the same time frame
3030000	3033400	as Gran Turismo 3, which means, uh, in a few years.
3033400	3035680	You mean Gran Turismo 5?
3035680	3036680	Whatever.
3036680	3038960	5-3, it doesn't matter.
3038960	3039960	At first...
3039960	3042000	The game isn't coming up this year, that's what it matters.
3042000	3044920	At first, I was like, no, they're not doing it.
3044920	3051720	But now that I'm hearing this whole disavowing of the PSP go, it makes a lot more sense that
3051720	3052720	that could be where they're going.
3052720	3056600	3 is the number of Forza games that'll be out before Gran Turismo 5.
3056600	3057600	Alright.
3057600	3060840	And I mean, additional Forza games.
3060840	3064280	Beyond the third one we've already had, 2 and 3.
3064280	3067600	I like my PSP, I think the PSP is like a pretty good system.
3067600	3071980	It was lacking in games for a while, I mean, yeah, Luminous was cool, but it was really
3071980	3075360	lacking in games for a while, but then it started getting, like, some real kick butt
3075360	3076360	stuff.
3076360	3079520	Especially with the Final Fantasy games were re-released for it, and you know, it had some
3079520	3080520	good stuff.
3080520	3084520	But I gotta be honest, though, even with just the regular PSP, it's not been doing great.
3084520	3089960	I mean, even just talking to my retailers about bringing a PSP title, they're really
3089960	3096160	just bringing in some that have them on the shelf, but it's not, you know, a big representation.
3096160	3098440	And that's kinda hurting them.
3098440	3103000	They really need, especially now with the 3DS, I mean, people are gonna be like, whatever,
3103000	3104960	I'm not buying anything on the PSP.
3104960	3108180	So they gotta come out with something new.
3108180	3109280	Is it gonna be out this year?
3109280	3111320	I highly doubt it.
3111320	3115240	Osfer brings up Valkyria Chronicles 2, that looks like it might be pretty cool.
3115240	3119400	Yeah, the Phantasy Star Portable 2 is also coming, which is somewhat big to people I
3119400	3120400	know.
3120400	3124480	AlphaCadandagram in our chatroom is mentioning that there is a giant Kevin Butler E3 banner,
3124480	3126480	apparently at the convention center right now.
3126480	3130760	Actually, I need to say something since you mentioned Phantasy Star Portable.
3130760	3136680	My friend Krista, if you go on Sega's website and look at the contests that they did for
3136680	3142000	doing fan art, she won third place doing pixel-style art of the characters.
3142000	3143720	So congratulations to Krista.
3143720	3144720	Congrats to you.
3144720	3145720	What does she win?
3145720	3146720	Copy the game.
3146720	3148280	Well, hey, that's something.
3148280	3150320	Free stuff is good.
3150320	3152760	Alright.
3152760	3158560	Moving on to some other news about Kingdom Hearts.
3158560	3163240	Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts has got a new game announced at E3, but it's not the big
3163240	3164240	number 3.
3164240	3165800	It is Kingdom Hearts Re-Coded.
3165800	3169360	There was a rumor about this on last week's show, it does look like it is official.
3169360	3173280	Kingdom Hearts Re-Coded is coming out for the DS, it's by the same people that were
3173280	3179600	behind 358 slash 2 days, and it will be on the show floor at E3, and apparently is going
3179600	3183960	to be a remake of the Japanese mobile game Kingdom Hearts Coded.
3183960	3185880	Just like they did with Chains of Memories, remember?
3185880	3188080	Kingdom Hearts Re-Chains of Memories?
3188080	3189360	Yes.
3189360	3192680	No word on the release date yet, we don't know if it's going to be this year or next,
3192680	3198440	hopefully this Christmas, but it will be about Sora retracing his steps through the original
3198440	3199880	Kingdom Hearts.
3199880	3203240	Jiminy Cricket apparently is looking over the journal he used to document his first
3203240	3206520	adventure with Sora, and he discovers a mysterious message.
3206520	3207520	Interesting.
3207520	3209800	So, it's not something he wrote, so how did it get there?
3209800	3210960	I don't know.
3210960	3214000	Sounds confusing, just like the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
3214000	3215880	Which I roll my eyes to.
3215880	3216880	Why?
3216880	3219720	Because, Kingdom Hearts is not that great.
3219720	3220720	It's just kind of boring.
3220720	3221720	I think it's pretty cool.
3221720	3225720	Was the message, uh, sitting on the toilet?
3225720	3226720	Shut up.
3226720	3229920	Alright, uh, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3229920	3232280	Jamie, you got something for us?
3232280	3234280	I have nuts.
3234280	3236280	Me too.
3236280	3243080	This one is actually about our good friends at Capcom.
3243080	3247800	It's um, what's it, they're an E3 lineup and I'm pretty excited.
3247800	3252040	Marvel vs Capcom 3 Fate of Two Worlds, which, by the way, I saw the last trailer, and it
3252040	3255080	has Deadpool and Dante, and that made me very squee.
3255080	3262920	Um, Okami Den, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes, Ghost Trick
3262920	3270880	Phantom Detective, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 2K0, MotoGP 910.
3270880	3273000	So it sounds like Capcom's booth is going to be pretty hopping.
3273000	3275900	I really hope Marvel vs Capcom 3 is playable.
3275900	3278080	Take me lots of pictures and get me lots of swag.
3278080	3279080	I will.
3279080	3280080	I really want to play it.
3280080	3281080	I want Deadpool stuff.
3281080	3282800	I will play as Deadpool just for you.
3282800	3283800	You better.
3283800	3284800	Alright.
3284800	3285800	And he'll be terrible.
3285800	3287680	Yeah I will, because I'm terrible at Marvel vs Capcom.
3287680	3289280	But Deadpool has guns.
3289280	3290280	And snark.
3290280	3293280	Actually that's not true, when I played at that retro arcade a couple weeks ago in Portland,
3293280	3295960	I just kind of button mashed and I did pretty good.
3295960	3300400	All I, you just do, you know, it's all Street Fighter moves, like quarter circle forward
3300400	3304200	and back and forward, you know, it's all Street Fighter moves, you just do a bunch of Street
3304200	3307080	Fighter moves and then your characters are going, whoa, how do we get back?
3307080	3310920	I hope that's not the final list for Capcom, I hope they have a few more games than just
3310920	3311920	that.
3311920	3312920	There might be some surprises.
3312920	3313920	I always see Dead Rising 2 real bad too.
3313920	3316000	I wonder what Dead Rising 2K0 is.
3316000	3319400	I don't follow up on Dead Rising 2, it's probably the Wii port.
3319400	3320400	No, K0.
3320400	3321400	3DS port.
3321400	3326600	K0 is the sort of demo for the game, it's basically going to be a downloaded game that
3326600	3330760	you have to pay for, that's like a prequel to Dead Rising 2.
3330760	3333760	But it will essentially be like the demo for the game.
3333760	3335000	I see.
3335000	3337480	Showing off a demo at E3 of a demo.
3337480	3340960	A demo of a demo, good times.
3340960	3341960	Loki.
3341960	3348420	There was an editorial written on Kotaku this week, talking about the, kind of the trend
3348420	3354160	going on with these new sports games from THQ and EA.
3354160	3360400	You may remember the one time use online codes that are part of the Project 10 dollars, or
3360400	3368080	I guess in THQ's case, we won another five dollars from you.
3368080	3370920	I just thought there were some points that were kind of interesting that they brought
3370920	3372580	up in this.
3372580	3378480	Some of it, you know, kind of tying into, will it really be that big a deal for consumers
3378480	3381400	out there that are interested in buying used products, because it's going to be additional
3381400	3382400	money.
3382400	3388140	Well, they were saying that GameStop has been starting to drop in the trade-in values of
3388140	3389320	different games.
3389320	3395080	For most new releases, which you used to be able to get for $30, you're now getting $25.
3395080	3403840	And it's also, some of the games, like for example, UFC, the use price is now $44.99,
3403840	3406800	which is five dollars cheaper than the other new releases.
3406800	3410020	So they're kind of factoring in, okay, you're going to have to pay another five dollars
3410020	3414960	to get online, and it's going to bring it up to the price of a normal use game, or a
3414960	3420520	normal use game of that quality, that time frame, that kind of stuff.
3420520	3422380	So maybe it won't be that big of an impact.
3422380	3427240	I still say don't forget what's going on, though, because as soon as you say, well,
3427240	3431840	that's not so bad, you know, that's when they start going, okay, well now you're going to
3431840	3435240	be having to pay for this, and you're going to have to pay for this, and pay for this,
3435240	3439640	and this, and this, and this, and just going to go on and on.
3439640	3451220	But also they're saying that the one-time use code has diminished resale expectations.
3451220	3455040	They're saying that people who tend to be passionate about, you know, games on their
3455040	3463360	consoles haven't been, like, selling them back in, that kind of stuff, I don't know.
3463360	3467760	So it's interesting, though, and I guess this is going to keep going on, and you remember
3467760	3470960	there was a rumor, and I'm sure we're not going to hear anything about it until the
3470960	3477000	game comes out, but it is a few weeks from now that Microsoft will be following suit
3477000	3478000	with Crackdown 2.
3478000	3485040	I'm kind of irritated because, yeah, yet another reason that, I don't know if it was so obvious
3485040	3489200	at first, but it just diminishes the value of the game to be able to resell.
3489200	3494560	Even if you do get the $10 code for free when it's new, you know, if you use it, it's totally
3494560	3497240	diminishing the value of the game that you sell back.
3497240	3499600	And that, I think, is probably one of the most irritating components of this.
3499600	3506440	But at the end of the day, the only way that you can express your distaste for this whole
3506440	3509320	little rule is to not buy the game.
3509320	3510320	But I don't think that's going to happen.
3510320	3511480	I think people will still buy it.
3511480	3515480	I honestly think we shouldn't be paying for games at $60.
3515480	3520240	I would like to just boycott the $60 video game, but sadly I don't see it happening.
3520240	3525240	And honestly, you know, me personally, this is not really affecting me that much because
3525240	3527520	I don't buy used games anymore.
3527520	3532000	And a lot of stuff, if I'm going to buy it in the first place, I'm buying it new.
3532000	3536440	If I'm, you know, not buying it right when it comes out new, then I'm not going to buy
3536440	3537440	it at all.
3537440	3543600	So for me, since this is really just affecting, you know, used games and stuff like that,
3543600	3544840	it's not a big deal.
3544840	3548200	Now if I wanted to loan it to a friend or something like that, that kind of sucks for
3548200	3549200	them.
3549200	3553880	But I don't really run into that situation that much.
3553880	3558360	Dark Sakura's got guys in their skivvies over there.
3558360	3559360	What is going on over there?
3559360	3560360	He plays Sims 3.
3560360	3561360	I was just picking his pajamas.
3561360	3563360	I was just, you're, that's not pajamas.
3563360	3566120	That's just sleeping in their underwear.
3566120	3567120	No, I know.
3567120	3570680	But you know, I'm just saying, it's just funny because I looked over, I'm like, what is she
3570680	3571680	playing?
3571680	3575840	I don't like the pajamas in the game, so I just had him sleep in his undies, but there
3575840	3577520	is his undies are Calvin Klein.
3577520	3579240	You should get him Calvin Klein undies.
3579240	3581280	You should get him bananas in pajamas.
3581280	3585120	Do you want me to take a picture and put it, I'm putting a picture up.
3585120	3589600	If you really want, I don't care.
3589600	3590600	Sorry Loki.
3590600	3594140	I looked over there, I'm like, is Dark Sakura watching porn during this program?
3594140	3595440	What is she doing?
3595440	3596440	What is she doing?
3596440	3597440	All right.
3597440	3598440	Yeah.
3598440	3602720	It's, it's just interesting because, um, I don't know.
3602720	3608600	It's just seems to me it, their excuses for why they're doing it, um, you know, being
3608600	3613840	that they're going to enhance the online, enhance like all this community stuff.
3613840	3617080	I just have a feeling they're not going to deliver with that in that it's just desperate
3617080	3618080	cash grab.
3618080	3619360	If, if they really do that, that's cool.
3619360	3624440	I'm fine with the extra $10 or whatever they're saying, but otherwise it's just taking a key
3624440	3629200	component of the game and charging you for it when it should already be there as part
3629200	3630720	of the normal cost.
3630720	3634280	My problem is why they're getting money anyways for you sale.
3634280	3636360	They really shouldn't deserve that kind of money.
3636360	3637520	No, they don't.
3637520	3641520	The only other thing that kind of pisses me off about the whole thing is, is just, you
3641520	3645880	know, not just the resale value, but just the fact that they're, you have all this corporate
3645880	3649480	speak about, well, we're taking the money to make our online, uh, some infrastructure
3649480	3652600	better to really enhance the experience of playing the games.
3652600	3655720	It's like, bitch, you just, you're looking for a way to make money.
3655720	3662560	I have a comment about that.
3662560	3666520	With a UFC, didn't they implement that so badly that some people that even bought it
3666520	3670920	brand new got double charged because like the directions weren't clear when you'd enter
3670920	3675400	the code and it would actually make you pay for the code and then you could use your code.
3675400	3677760	I think I read stuff about that when it came out.
3677760	3684040	I don't know that I'm not surprised if that's what actually happened.
3684040	3691720	All right, well, moving on, boy, I've just seen this from chat.
3691720	3692720	Somebody just posted this.
3692720	3693720	You need a breaking news noise.
3693720	3696240	Do I need the breaking news noise because that's ugly.
3696240	3698120	I don't have the breaking news noise.
3698120	3715400	I can talk about, um, how I am breeding stuff in Pokemon and I bike back and forth on the
3715400	3716400	path.
3716400	3733560	Um, so it hatches the eggs quicker because I don't like to run around and apparently
3733560	3736560	a new pop music game has just been announced.
3736560	3739080	And most of our listeners aren't going to understand what the hell that means.
3739080	3743920	But a pop music was a music game franchise that basically imagine trouble with the pop
3743920	3748640	ematic bubble and you have nine of those pop ematic bubbles all in a little configuration
3748640	3752480	you play popular in Japan and you hit the buttons to, and it was in the movie lost in
3752480	3753480	translation.
3753480	3757640	I believe, uh, you can play this, whatever, uh, you can play this game.
3757640	3760760	I guess a new version of pop music has been announced, but here's the thing.
3760760	3765840	It is like a U S version now because they're testing this in Irvine, California.
3765840	3769880	Please say it doesn't have those ticket redemption machine.
3769880	3770880	I hate you.
3770880	3771880	Konami.
3771880	3778160	I hate you so much, the logo looks like it's from beaten, groovy kind of does Konami.
3778160	3779400	You just don't get it anymore.
3779400	3780640	You're fired.
3780640	3781640	I'm firing you.
3781640	3782640	Konami.
3782640	3783640	You can not make any more music games.
3783640	3786920	I wonder if they'll be announcing this week three, I don't know.
3786920	3791180	Konami a company that thinks saw is a viable franchise for video games.
3791180	3793000	That saw game was not awful.
3793000	3796080	I will defend that game cause it was fun except for the combat.
3796080	3798360	The combat was dumb, but the puzzles were fun.
3798360	3799360	I liked them.
3799360	3804400	I just like to kill people horrifically with really good puzzles.
3804400	3806600	It's like evil professor Layton.
3806600	3807880	That should be a game right there.
3807880	3813560	Kill them with puzzles for the three D S Ray Iannami in our chat says sky and he keeps
3813560	3817280	saying Konami needs to redesign their rhythm games.
3817280	3819240	That's not what I meant.
3819240	3822000	It's not what I fucking meant.
3822000	3823000	Ticket game.
3823000	3824920	I'm not surprised one bit.
3824920	3826840	It'll be popular.
3826840	3830960	If the deal or no deal game is popular, no, this won't be because it's not something you
3830960	3836040	see on TV with Howie Mandel true Bobby's world, the ticket redemption game.
3836040	3840840	That would be something that would be popular with America's got talent.
3840840	3841840	Yeah.
3841840	3849140	That show speaking of, uh, the saw type things and so forth, there was a lot of news that
3849140	3854760	came out this week about mortal combat and one of them was this very strange teaser that
3854760	3857080	was a mystery and nobody knew what it was.
3857080	3860840	I'm trying to play a little bit here in studio.
3860840	3861840	It's loud.
3861840	3862840	Sorry.
3862840	3863840	No, this, no, no.
3863840	3868600	This thing, that one, this thing that came out this week, this show, yes, that's supposed
3868600	3869600	to be like reptile.
3869600	3870600	Right?
3870600	3873720	Yeah, no, that, that, that's, that's actually old.
3873720	3876840	The guy was friends with Jerry Ryan, which is why she's in it.
3876840	3877840	Interesting.
3877840	3880960	This, this actually, this actually is a few months old.
3880960	3884640	Well, it just, I guess leaked to, to all the blogs and all this stuff, by the way, like
3884640	3890040	that, he rips the head off the body then eats the head and so pretty, so it's pretty gross,
3890040	3894880	but whatever this is, it is basically somebody's re-imagining and people are like, is this
3894880	3896880	a trailer for a new game?
3896880	3898800	Is this, what the frack is this?
3898800	3900080	And Jerry Ryan's in it.
3900080	3901080	Jerry Ryan is in it.
3901080	3902080	She's Sonya at the very end.
3902080	3906520	Let me see if I can fast forward and, uh, Johnny cage is the emotion actor for a Nathan
3906520	3908080	Drake from uncharted one.
3908080	3909080	Is it really cool?
3909080	3910080	Well, there's Jerry Ryan.
3910080	3915520	There's a big climactic scene where they're about to reveal scorpion or whatever.
3915520	3921640	Uh, so apparently what this ended up being, it is actually a kind of like a labor of love
3921640	3926360	type of thing where the director was trying to sell Warner brothers on the mortal combat
3926360	3927360	pitch.
3927360	3928360	This guy wants to direct the movie.
3928360	3930760	This is the guy that directed fame.
3930760	3931760	I believe so.
3931760	3932760	Yeah.
3932760	3933760	That's what it's.
3933760	3934760	All right, whatever.
3934760	3935760	So apparently, yeah, musical numbers too.
3935760	3936760	That'd be awesome.
3936760	3937760	Actually.
3937760	3941080	Uh, so this is, I love these re-imagining pitches.
3941080	3945160	They're like, I saw the one for nightmare on Elm street before they had decided to redo
3945160	3946160	it.
3946160	3947480	Some guy just funded.
3947480	3951720	It's kind of a really ballsy thing for them to do is to put it up on the internet for
3951720	3953320	all the public scrutiny.
3953320	3955640	The guy must've believed in the thing that much.
3955640	3958040	And so far the reception has been pretty positive.
3958040	3959040	I don't know.
3959040	3960040	I gotta be honest.
3960040	3961200	I'm going to go against the grain a little bit.
3961200	3966660	I think it's well done and it's nice, but I always kind of liked mortal combat cause
3966660	3969320	it was a little bit over the top and cartoony.
3969320	3973360	And that was a little bit like gritty, real saw for me.
3973360	3974360	I don't know.
3974360	3975940	I don't know how I feel about that.
3975940	3978680	I don't know if that's how the movie would actually turn out, but I was kind of like,
3978680	3981080	I kind of like mortal combat cause it was always a little bit ridiculous.
3981080	3983200	The first one did it best.
3983200	3986320	The second one was a waste of time.
3986320	3989840	But I'm all for, I guess them trying to give this guy a chance, especially since so many
3989840	3991040	people seem to be into it.
3991040	3995000	I mean, just because I have one opinion, you know, whatever, I guess it might get outvoted.
3995000	4000760	So I guess it could be cool, but it was really seven minutes of this cop interrogation and
4000760	4004560	I would just hope the movie is a little, no, it wasn't just the interrogation.
4004560	4009760	It was the fight with Johnny Cage, like introducing the characters.
4009760	4014320	I thought it was awesome and they should totally make the movie.
4014320	4015320	We'll see.
4015320	4016320	We'll see.
4016320	4017320	This is my least favorite character in the series.
4017320	4018940	Poor Johnny Cage can't catch a break.
4018940	4022120	I did like doing the foot through the heart and then the signing the autograph.
4022120	4024120	That was kind of cool.
4024120	4025120	All right.
4025120	4028720	Well, also, you know, because a lot of people did mistake that this might've been a teaser
4028720	4035000	for the game, apparently there really was a teaser for the game in the works and it
4035000	4040160	showed up a little later, just literally a few days later, a new teaser for Mortal Combat
4040160	4042160	Nine showed up.
4042160	4045840	It's got a little bit of Raiden and he's, you know, shooting lightning and then there's
4045840	4051120	a lot of like very fast images that kind of shows a lot of the old school characters and
4051120	4054480	old school stages from like Mortal Combat Two and Three.
4054480	4060080	Like you see Johnny Cage and Reptile and Nightwolf right there shooting his arrow and they're
4060080	4063960	on a stage that looks like the pit from the second game.
4063960	4071240	It almost looks like kind of the best parts of Mortal Combat Two and Three with the graphics
4071240	4074960	of the newer Mortal Combat games.
4074960	4081240	And then kind of like in this super Street Fighter Four-esque 2D, 3D thing.
4081240	4082240	I'm sold.
4082240	4083240	I think it looks great.
4083240	4084240	I'd play it.
4084240	4085240	It's cool.
4085240	4087600	Um, I'd like to see more characters added.
4087600	4094800	I know this is just a teaser, but, um, it didn't pick some of the best that's for sure.
4094800	4095800	Yeah.
4095800	4096800	That hat on the ground is really funny.
4096800	4101860	For those that haven't seen the trailer, Kung Lao puts the hat on the ground and it starts
4101860	4105880	spinning like a circular saw and he starts grabbing sub-zero and, and pulling him towards
4105880	4106880	it.
4106880	4111120	Like he's going to rip his body in half with the saw, starting with his ween, wiener.
4111120	4115920	So yeah, interesting.
4115920	4118360	A little, a little bit over the top, but I don't know.
4118360	4121520	Again, a little, a little, they're starting to get a little too realistic.
4121520	4122520	I don't know.
4122520	4123800	I liked Mortal Combat when it was cartoony and dumb.
4123800	4125360	I can't believe we're at nine.
4125360	4129520	Like you said, that's an insane amount for a lot of forgettable titles.
4129520	4132840	Yeah, sadly, I always, I always kind of had an appreciation for Mortal Combat.
4132840	4135600	I always thought a lot of them were really underrated and they're a lot of fun.
4135600	4136600	They're just dumb fun.
4136600	4138920	And that's the important part of the game.
4138920	4140720	So there you go.
4140720	4144240	Uh, that is supposedly also at the E3 show floor.
4144240	4147520	There are some big banners hanging from the ceiling, teasing the new Mortal Combat game.
4147520	4149880	So I know I, I definitely want to stop by and check that out.
4149880	4151360	I wonder if we can get one.
4151360	4155360	Like you could prop me up and I'll know the banner and prop me up and I'll take it down
4155360	4156360	and we'll steal it.
4156360	4163320	You know, the show floor is like, or the ceiling is, you know, not more, it's a lot higher
4163320	4164320	than popping you up.
4164320	4165320	Yeah.
4165320	4167320	I was going to say, you're kind of short.
4167320	4168320	Yeah.
4168320	4169320	Yeah.
4169320	4170320	It's like, hi, you propped me up.
4170320	4171320	Great.
4171320	4172320	Now I'm only 30 feet away from it.
4172320	4174800	Well then you can just kind of like push me up a little more.
4174800	4175800	Like, like toss me.
4175800	4176800	I'll just throw you.
4176800	4177800	Like Cirque du Soleil.
4177800	4178800	Cirque du Soleil.
4178800	4179800	I can't even say it.
4179800	4180800	There you go.
4180800	4181800	The stupid French thing.
4181800	4182800	You were about to say Cirque du Soleil.
4182800	4183800	I definitely was not going to say that.
4183800	4188440	Alright, let's move on to some release dates.
4188440	4192840	Travel around the world and talk about what is coming out soon to a retail store near
4192840	4193840	you.
4193840	4196440	We go to the UK and the U.S. and Japan.
4196440	4197800	We're going to start off with Loki in the U.S.
4197800	4202640	Yes, you know, it's going to be a wonderful week since the biggest title coming out this
4202640	4205120	week is Toy Story 3.
4205120	4212720	Toy Story 3 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP and PC.
4212720	4214840	And now the rest of the crap.
4214840	4218640	Let's play Garden coming out on DS this week.
4218640	4222800	And on the Wii, let's play Ballerina coming out on DS and the Wii.
4222800	4223800	Let's play Ballerina.
4223800	4225640	100 classic books.
4225640	4229760	The only game released on the DS that actually wasn't rated by the ESRB.
4229760	4231680	The most boring video game ever made.
4231680	4232680	I want that though.
4232680	4233680	Because it's books.
4233680	4237000	I think that'd be a great, great $20 spent.
4237000	4239840	Video game called Let's Go to the Library.
4239840	4243920	Legend of Kay coming to the Nintendo DS.
4243920	4248960	XG Blast is supposed to be like a shmup game coming to the Nintendo DS.
4248960	4252960	Superbike World Championship, SBK coming to the PS3.
4252960	4256080	It's a budget game.
4256080	4257080	What else?
4257080	4258240	Kid Adventure Sky Captain.
4258240	4259240	Actually this one looks okay.
4259240	4261320	It's kind of like Pilotwings on the Wii.
4261320	4263120	Also only a budget game.
4263120	4266400	And then this is the kind of stuff that Konami keeps putting out.
4266400	4267400	Thank you, Konami.
4267400	4268400	You're wonderful.
4268400	4269400	Yard Sale.
4269400	4270400	There's Sunnyville.
4270400	4272800	Guess where you're going to find this game?
4272800	4273800	In a yard sale.
4273800	4274800	Wait, Sunnyvale?
4274800	4275800	Sunnyville.
4275800	4276800	Oh, I was going to say.
4276800	4278240	It's like a game set in Sunnyvale?
4278240	4279240	That's kind of cool.
4279240	4282720	No, it's Sunnyville.
4282720	4284720	And thank you, GameStop.
4284720	4288200	You put Sunnyville with three L's instead of two.
4288200	4289720	Way to proofread.
4289720	4293680	Think Smart coming to the Nintendo DS.
4293680	4296040	Western Riding Academy on the DS.
4296040	4297640	Yay, another horse riding game.
4297640	4299760	We don't have any of those.
4299760	4305120	Naval Assault the Killing Tide, a submarine action game on the Xbox 360.
4305120	4311200	And another crappy game on the Wii Family Game Show, which is going to be some stupid
4311200	4315280	party game by a company I've never heard of, Storm City Games.
4315280	4318000	And last but not least, I Spy Universe.
4318000	4319000	Who gives a shit?
4319000	4320720	I don't care what system it's on.
4320720	4322400	The end.
4322400	4326360	Ray Iannami in chat says, there aren't enough games set in the SF Bay Area.
4326360	4328860	How about every racing game ever made?
4328860	4333560	Always has like some type of San Francisco stage because of the hills.
4333560	4339920	Although in real life, folks, you go about three miles an hour down all of those roads.
4339920	4340920	There's always three.
4340920	4344640	It's going to have a San Francisco level because you know, San Francisco, what it's most known
4344640	4349680	for earthquakes, because every game that has a disaster in it, San Francisco has the earthquakes.
4349680	4354640	Cruisin' USA had Blur has a San Francisco level.
4354640	4355640	They all do.
4355640	4356640	Every single one of them.
4356640	4357800	Mario Kart has a San Francisco level.
4357800	4358800	That's right.
4358800	4360440	It's called Toad San Francisco Adventure.
4360440	4363620	Speaking of Blur, by the way, in Mario Kart, did you see that commercial?
4363620	4364800	It is amazing.
4364800	4367360	That is the best thing I've seen.
4367360	4372600	Dan was watching Classic Game Room and it was the leading in commercial and I laughed
4372600	4373960	my butt off.
4373960	4374960	Good times.
4374960	4378600	What are you fitting your little guy in panties over there?
4378600	4381240	He looks like he's wearing panties, mantis.
4381240	4384480	I'm picking his bathing suit and I'm just trying out different fabric patterns.
4384480	4386920	Trees don't really wear that to the beach, at least in America.
4386920	4391720	I realize like Greece, it's a little different, but we're all fat.
4391720	4393240	I'm just trying different fabrics.
4393240	4397920	I just want to make sure, you know, Nintendo should want to make sure you were aware.
4397920	4399360	I'll use gold sequins.
4399360	4400360	Gold sequins.
4400360	4404400	Nintendo should really come out with a commercial later on for its next Mario Kart game and
4404400	4409400	say, yeah, Blur wants to go ahead and make fun of our games, but our games still made
4409400	4410600	millions of copies.
4410600	4412120	Yours doesn't.
4412120	4413120	Fuck you.
4413120	4414120	Nintendo.
4414120	4416160	Let's go to Japanese release dates.
4416160	4421520	Clash of the Titans gets its Japanese localization from Namco this week on the Xbox 360.
4421520	4423600	Otherwise all is quiet on the 360 this week.
4423600	4426880	PlayStation 3 has a little more, not just a version of Clash of the Titans there too,
4426880	4432920	but they also have Grid getting a price reduction and a game called Hakioki Jun Soroku comes
4432920	4435160	out in a special and limited edition.
4435160	4438960	So usually when it's limited edition, you know, it's a kind of a bigger kind of a game.
4438960	4442120	It comes with a plate and a pillowcase and a clock.
4442120	4444080	It is a whole big franchise out there.
4444080	4446200	There's actually an anime based on it as well.
4446200	4449360	So that's the Hakioki is coming out there on PS3.
4449360	4452800	So that's a pretty big release over there this week.
4452800	4459640	Also on the other systems going to the Nintendo Wii, Hospital 6 Nin no Ishii is coming out
4459640	4460640	in Japan from Atlas.
4460640	4462280	I don't know if this is a trauma center game.
4462280	4463280	No, it's not.
4463280	4464560	I guess it's maybe a spinoff or something.
4464560	4468440	It's just a different hospital game, but there is your mandatory chick with big boobs.
4468440	4470560	No, that's the trauma center.
4470560	4471560	Is it really?
4471560	4472560	Yeah, the one that we just got.
4472560	4473560	It looks like an anime or something.
4473560	4474560	It looks exactly the same.
4474560	4475560	Really?
4475560	4477360	It just looks so different.
4477360	4478360	Trauma Team.
4478360	4479840	That's what the American one's called.
4479840	4480840	Weird.
4480840	4481840	All right.
4481840	4487560	Well, maybe it's the release of Trauma Team then.
4487560	4490640	I define better Dark Sakura when you're showing me that guy.
4490640	4492360	How about how about Fishnet?
4492360	4493880	No, thank you.
4493880	4494880	All right.
4494880	4501000	Also on the Nintendo DS this week, Igo Koro Koyushitsu comes out on the Nintendo DS this
4501000	4502000	week.
4502000	4505400	And this is a game where apparently you, I don't, I don't even know what this is.
4505400	4509240	It's like apples on the cover with the stylus.
4509240	4510240	It's like, let's draw apples.
4510240	4511240	I wonder if it's a painting game.
4511240	4512240	I bet that's what it is.
4512240	4513240	It's a painting game.
4513240	4514240	Yeah.
4514240	4515560	It's probably a let's paint on the DS.
4515560	4517520	Learn how to paint apples.
4517520	4518560	Still life.
4518560	4521240	So they did have a let's paint game on the Wii.
4521240	4523640	It's a painting game fun.
4523640	4530680	And then lastly on the PSP, nothing this week, but next week you get project diva on this
4530680	4535560	Sega from Sega on PSP, you have that to look forward to dark soccer.
4535560	4545080	How about the UK stuff on the 13th of my Theon for PC and the 16th, we have ancients of UGA.
4545080	4546520	Okay.
4546520	4551800	And then, um, on the 18th, we have everybody's tennis.
4551800	4554160	I'm not alone.
4554160	4560440	International cricket, 2010 project runway and metal gear, solid peace Walker on PSP.
4560440	4562080	Yeah.
4562080	4565080	That's pretty good.
4565080	4568080	Let's move to Europe right now.
4568080	4573640	You can't forget about the Korean releases, which last week brought, uh, the new DJ max
4573640	4574640	game.
4574640	4575640	That's like ours that we got here.
4575640	4577760	Should we throw in Korean releases?
4577760	4578760	No.
4578760	4584720	Oh, cause we don't want to.
4584720	4586720	And a Miro.
4586720	4587720	Yes.
4587720	4588720	All right.
4588720	4593200	Uh, let's talk a little bit about 3d on PS3.
4593200	4594200	That's right.
4594200	4600040	This week we actually got update on the PS3 firmware, uh, to allow for some games to support
4600040	4601800	stereoscopic 3d.
4601800	4609440	Um, these games of course would be wipeout HD pain, super stardust HD and motor storm
4609440	4610440	Pacific grip.
4610440	4615520	Um, they have a demo apparently with I think one level that was in 3d and a wipeout I want
4615520	4619720	to say is all in 3d pain has a 3d level.
4619720	4624000	You know, that was actually one of the reasons, um, that the, uh, back in the day when, remember
4624000	4631080	when they were doing the gorillas holographic thing for their concerts, um, they were doing
4631080	4636600	the projections and everything and they said that, uh, they had to keep sound around it
4636600	4642880	at a particular level or it would start making the light waves start jitter and they had
4642880	4648120	that problem when they did with Madonna because when her song started in it was that heavy
4648120	4651760	bass and it made the holograms jitter.
4651760	4657640	Well, being that this isn't holograms, hopefully we won't have that problem.
4657640	4662960	But it's still a matter of, of sight and perception and it's still the waves themselves are still
4662960	4664160	a physical thing.
4664160	4667440	The only holograms I want to see are fronted by Jim.
4667440	4672640	Now this, I mean, looks kind of cool, but you know, it's one of those things.
4672640	4677880	I'm not buying a new damn TV and I'm not buying, you know, expensive glasses to go with these
4677880	4680800	TVs just for some of these games.
4680800	4684400	It's one of those things where when the technology comes down in price in about five years, I
4684400	4685400	think more people will have it.
4685400	4691280	But right now I think this is a little too soon, but I am so like over the 3d craze.
4691280	4696400	Like I just, I see all these movies coming out in 3d like there's the resident evil movie
4696400	4701720	in 3d and the new saws, everything is in 3d and I'm just, I'm over it.
4701720	4703520	3d movies make you sick.
4703520	4704520	Stop it.
4704520	4706880	I liked Avatar in 3d.
4706880	4707880	That was a long time.
4707880	4712480	But Avatar would have been, I would have felt just as fine with Avatar in 2d.
4712480	4714800	Having seen it both ways, I really did prefer it in 3d.
4714800	4719360	Well here's the thing with like Avatar or something like that, um, when they're filming
4719360	4724520	that movie, they're not really, it's just like a normal movie just filmed in 3d.
4724520	4728120	Whereas a lot of people, when you film something in 3d, they want to do a lot of stuff to really
4728120	4732800	kind of capitalize on the 3d, like throw stuff at you or you know, have you fly around really
4732800	4734720	fast or something like that.
4734720	4739280	And that's great and all, but it's, this isn't like an amusement park ride.
4739280	4741840	I mean, we don't really need that kind of stuff.
4741840	4745780	Just make a good movie and that'd be it.
4745780	4751520	Now the motion box seats, that's more amusement park fare.
4751520	4755520	And God, please do not have that trend make its way to consoles.
4755520	4759320	I don't need a moving couch.
4759320	4760320	All right.
4760320	4763000	Well, another music game was announced this week.
4763000	4766120	That's going to be showing its way at the floor at E3 this year.
4766120	4768100	It's DJ Hero 2.
4768100	4771120	You know, some folks are saying the DJ Hero didn't really sell what they were hoping it
4771120	4772120	would.
4772120	4774100	Although didn't, didn't DJ Hero kind of keep selling?
4774100	4777400	Like maybe it didn't sell a lot at the beginning, but it kind of has kept selling.
4777400	4778400	It's done okay.
4778400	4782320	I think for like a brand new franchise, you know, it did all right.
4782320	4786400	And considering how much they've supported their download content, in other words, not
4786400	4787400	at all.
4787400	4789400	Um, I'm surprised it sold what it did.
4789400	4793960	Well, there was some, uh, content released this week in celebration of DJ Hero 2.
4793960	4796240	They did release some free content this week.
4796240	4805840	Uh, it is DJ Hero 2's mix for Just Dance by Lady Gaga with Ghosts and Stuff by Deadmau5.
4805840	4814400	Let's listen a little bit of it here.
4814400	4822480	Yeah, it's all right.
4822480	4823480	Sounds kind of fun.
4823480	4827200	Uh, so 70 new songs are supposed to be coming to DJ Hero 2.
4827200	4832640	Kanye West, Chemical Brothers, Dr. Dre, Gaga, Rihanna, Metallica, lots and lots and lots
4832640	4833920	of artists going to be in this.
4833920	4838640	Uh, the sequel will also be putting in microphone game, gameplay.
4838640	4841400	It's also going to have a lot more of, uh, two turntables at once.
4841400	4845600	So literally you will have, yes, two turntables and a microphone.
4845600	4848080	Oh, how many times have you heard that joke this week?
4848080	4849080	Then they got it.
4849080	4850640	They totally have to put back in there then.
4850640	4853600	Um, yeah, it's interesting that they have the karaoke mode in there.
4853600	4856560	I guess it's kind of cool to have an additional person playing.
4856560	4860880	Um, I wonder if they didn't mention anything about a guitar here, you know, guitar mode
4860880	4861880	coming back.
4861880	4864440	So I'm wondering if they're going to do something special with that, if they're gonna have like
4864440	4865440	band mode or something.
4865440	4866440	I hope they just scrapped it.
4866440	4868280	I didn't like it in the first one.
4868280	4870240	There was only, there were only 10 songs.
4870240	4874400	Yeah, but it's, hey, it's better to have something, you know, additional than, you know, removing
4874400	4875400	something altogether.
4875400	4879680	Now, granted, if it's a space issue and they want to replace those 10 songs with better
4879680	4880680	songs.
4880680	4881680	Yeah.
4881680	4882680	Yeah, that's fine.
4882680	4887000	Um, did you see though the freestyle, um, crossfade stuff that they have now?
4887000	4888000	No.
4888000	4889000	That's pretty sweet.
4889000	4893320	Whereas before you could do like, you know, those freestyle sections where you had the
4893320	4894320	red button.
4894320	4895320	Yeah, I hate it.
4895320	4898240	Well now they have freestyle scratching so you can do like sections where you can do
4898240	4902200	scratching and freestyle cross fades and they'll actually give you cues where different like
4902200	4904640	vocal things start and you can crossfade back and forth.
4904640	4905640	That's really cool.
4905640	4906640	Yeah.
4906640	4907800	So a lot more stuff.
4907800	4911240	And they also said, um, you know, those samples that you trigger and stuff, how they really
4911240	4916640	have the annoying, um, uh, flava flave samples and stuff like that.
4916640	4920800	Well now the samples are going to be, um, you know, tying in with the songs instead.
4920800	4922640	You're not going to choose these different sample sets.
4922640	4926480	So Tiger class says, I mispronounced the name of that other artist is dead mouse.
4926480	4927480	Well, it's not my fault.
4927480	4928480	He has to type all week.
4928480	4929480	And he has an awesome, whatever.
4929480	4930480	He has an awesome mouse.
4930480	4931480	Apparently he's in the game.
4931480	4933200	I think he has a giant mouse head.
4933200	4938800	We need some more like real dancey artists or real club artists like pendulum.
4938800	4943840	They're supposed to be focusing it more on, um, you know, electronic artists this time.
4943840	4944840	I hope so.
4944840	4947400	Pendulum would be awesome.
4947400	4951400	That would be, that would, I'd buy the game day one more than I already will buy it day
4951400	4952400	one.
4952400	4953400	Oh, I'm buying it day one as it is.
4953400	4954400	Oh yeah.
4954400	4956360	Even though I don't play the first one, I'd still want to go back to it.
4956360	4960480	It's just, you know, I, you know, I'm buying that day one scene with rock band three with
4960480	4963320	the keyboard because I totally want to play that.
4963320	4966800	I wonder if they'll improve the turntable at all because there were so many people that
4966800	4973820	were having problems with like buttons stop working and I have problems with the scratching
4973820	4975120	doesn't always trigger.
4975120	4976120	Yeah.
4976120	4977640	It's a little tricky sometimes.
4977640	4979400	Um, I don't know.
4979400	4986160	I have a, what was it, a, uh, beta controller and I also have a regular controller.
4986160	4987560	I have a wired controller.
4987560	4988560	Nice.
4988560	4991880	Oh, I have the wired three 61 from the demo.
4991880	4992880	Yeah.
4992880	4993880	Yeah.
4993880	4994880	Yeah.
4994880	4995880	Demo controller.
4995880	4996880	Yeah.
4996880	4997880	All right folks.
4997880	5000440	Well, believe it or not, before we get to the end of part a, I have to break guys cause
5000440	5012400	we do have some special news.
5012400	5013400	That's right.
5013400	5015640	We break for this a special news report here.
5015640	5016640	Apparently this comes to us.
5016640	5022240	Thanks to Twitter and uh, uh, Bobby sent this along and alerted me to what's going on here.
5022240	5024680	Apparently the event is starting to get underway.
5024680	5031360	The whole, uh, kinetic event, they have forced the entire audience to wear ponchos.
5031360	5035820	They're all in these metallic poncho looking things.
5035820	5041600	Apparently the Xbox event will involve a splash zone or something.
5041600	5044480	I don't know what the hell is going on.
5044480	5046720	It's going to be there hitting watermelons and tall.
5046720	5050760	This is the one, this is, they're repeating this Monday night and you, you, here's the
5050760	5051760	thing.
5051760	5055600	My mom and I actually had the opportunity to go to this event, but a day late cause
5055600	5059480	they're redoing it tomorrow night and we were like, that's okay.
5059480	5061600	And now I'm really feeling that was a good idea.
5061600	5065160	I would, that looks fun cause I don't know.
5065160	5067200	I'd like to get watermelon on me or something.
5067200	5070520	You get to keep these little shoulder pad poncho things.
5070520	5073280	Everybody looks so happy in the pictures to be wearing them.
5073280	5079980	They're probably like, Oh my God, I'm going to be a TV with this.
5079980	5082320	I'm not even joking, Bobby posts a link in chat.
5082320	5083320	I know you're listening.
5083320	5084320	It's funny.
5084320	5085320	Good stuff.
5085320	5086320	Big silver.
5086320	5091400	But if everybody in the audience is wearing that, it's going to look weird on TV.
5091400	5092560	You know what I was thinking though?
5092560	5096480	I was, I was making the joke, I'm like, you know how these camera games just really suck
5096480	5097880	and they don't work very well.
5097880	5099560	I'm like, is that what I need to wear?
5099560	5101480	Yeah, it's going to come packaged in.
5101480	5104760	Well you know how they had like, was it the stupid jumpsuits and stuff?
5104760	5111200	So apparently the connect only works if you're really wearing like a silly costume.
5111200	5114800	It's all silly costumes only.
5114800	5119400	All right, we are getting to the end here of part a on our show, but you know, we cannot
5119400	5121920	call it quits until we get to one more segment.
5121920	5125160	We have to do the segment every week because if we don't, dark soccer finds me down and
5125160	5126240	threatens to kill me.
5126240	5127240	And sometimes she does.
5127240	5134120	Uh, it's the classic game of the week.
5134120	5137200	Dark soccer is going to dive into the vault and find a game she thinks you kids ought
5137200	5140560	to be playing this week and respecting dark soccer.
5140560	5143080	What is the classic game of the week?
5143080	5146040	Today's classic game is magician Lord.
5146040	5150840	And I literally walked into the vault and looked, what's the first game I see a magician
5150840	5151840	Lord.
5151840	5152840	Okay.
5152840	5154720	Which is a Neo Geo game.
5154720	5161840	It was developed by alpha Denshi and published by SMK and it is a Neo Geo arcade and the
5161840	5166520	home systems and virtual console came out in 1990.
5166520	5173160	So this is a platform game and it's, uh, it actually was one of the pack-ins for the Neo
5173160	5175000	Geo AES.
5175000	5177440	So that's probably why I have a copy.
5177440	5182800	Um, but it's about this wizard named Elta who is the last magician Lord going to save
5182800	5184960	his homeland.
5184960	5190960	And um, you go through and you get different spheres that will give you different abilities.
5190960	5198200	Um, excuse me, they can jump and shoot and climb and do all kinds of stuff.
5198200	5201920	I mean, you know, those fire and he cosplays every time he gets a sphere.
5201920	5202920	Well, okay.
5202920	5205600	He actually gets different abilities with each sphere.
5205600	5211440	Um, he also walks really funny and even if he walks fast, he still looks like he's prancing
5211440	5217160	kinda like it's just like he's climbing a ladder right now, but you just have to look
5217160	5218160	at him walk.
5218160	5219160	See, well, he's in, nevermind.
5219160	5222120	He wants funny when he's in for me.
5222120	5228280	Anyway, so he got, has a dragon warrior form who breathes fire and it's a continuous short
5228280	5234840	range attack and you can aim it diagonally and then water man where, um, those water
5234840	5240000	grenades that are blue bubbles that explode into water pillars, which sounds kind of like
5240000	5247160	caterpillar, but not, um, and then there's Poseidon, which is a more powerful water man.
5247160	5253240	He shoots waves of water and has a lot of damage and he can freeze enemies and shatter
5253240	5254240	on impact.
5254240	5257480	It moves very slowly.
5257480	5264040	The Shinobi, um, has, um, he's more agile and has powerful magic arcs of fire.
5264040	5266000	They are wide, but still moving.
5266000	5271240	There's the Samurai who can attack through barriers, which is walls, shields, multiple
5271240	5277880	enemies with the boomerang like energy attack and then Raijin who, um, gives Elta the ability
5277880	5284440	to jump a lot better and has an electrical field around his body and I guess that's because
5284440	5286760	Raijin's an electric person.
5286760	5288800	Um, so that is the game.
5288800	5293200	It's just, I think that he just walks really funny, kind of prancy funny.
5293200	5294200	He does.
5294200	5295200	He prances a little bit.
5295200	5296200	It's kind of funny.
5296200	5298520	I like his, his, a stylish blue hat.
5298520	5299520	It's quite stylish.
5299520	5300520	Yeah, very stylish.
5300520	5301520	I like that game.
5301520	5302520	All right.
5302520	5303520	There it is, folks.
5303520	5304520	Your classic game of the week.
5304520	5306120	Magician Lord.
5306120	5307440	Very classic Neo Geo game.
5307440	5308440	It's not a fighting game.
5308440	5309440	What's that?
5309440	5310440	He was fighting the purple nipple.
5310440	5311440	Yes, he is fighting the purple nipple.
5311440	5313000	Level one boss.
5313000	5314000	Good stuff.
5314000	5315280	Wasn't that game on Nick Arcade a lot?
5315280	5316280	Magician Lord?
5316280	5317280	I think so.
5317280	5318280	I think so.
5318280	5321520	I always get that one in Blue's Journey confused because the Magician Lord guy is really, really
5321520	5322520	blue.
5322520	5323520	Yes.
5323520	5324520	He is very blue.
5324520	5325520	Quite blue.
5325520	5326520	All right.
5326520	5328560	We are going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't worry guys.
5328560	5330360	We'll be right back with plenty more.
5330360	5333560	We're going to get to your phone calls tonight, of course, some rapid fire news, the mailbag
5333560	5335560	and all that good stuff we always do.
5335560	5337920	Also tonight, I've been keeping it a secret.
5337920	5341580	I want to do a little something special for you guys that are listening tonight.
5341580	5344960	We're going to do an Orange Lounge Radio game.
5344960	5345960	That's right tonight.
5345960	5347080	And we're bringing back a game tonight.
5347080	5350960	I know a lot of you were asking for a list list tonight, but we did list list for last
5350960	5351960	year's E3.
5351960	5355400	We, there's a game we haven't played in like months and months.
5355400	5360640	Alright guys, video game match game is coming up in part B tonight when we come back.
5360640	5362920	So this is good because we actually have four people in the studio, so we can actually kind
5362920	5364540	of do the video game match game.
5364540	5375760	So we'll be right back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5375760	5380440	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, June the 13th
5380440	5381440	of 2010.
5381440	5388000	We've got a lot of busy, busy E3 pre news tonight and lots of breaking news and updates
5388000	5390560	going on and all this stuff happening.
5390560	5392180	And will the madness never end?
5392180	5400680	Of course not.
5400680	5402920	I'm Tom Brokaw with a special report.
5402920	5407460	No, actually what's going on here, Alan just forwarded me this email and I kind of knew
5407460	5408460	about this.
5408460	5413280	I guess this email just went out from Blizzard kind of pimping their new real ID system on
5413280	5415000	World of Warcraft.
5415000	5418760	And one of the things you're going to want to pay attention to on this is the whole real
5418760	5420000	names for friends system.
5420000	5421000	Actually let me back up.
5421000	5424120	Let me talk a little bit about what this real ID thing is.
5424120	5431460	Basically it's Blizzard's own internal version of Steam slash XFire for their own games.
5431460	5434440	So you can see, like if you have friends that play WoW on different servers, you're going
5434440	5437760	to be able to talk to them on those different servers and interact with them and so forth.
5437760	5442900	But here's part of the catch that goes with that is that you're going to have real names
5442900	5444240	for friends.
5444240	5449080	Your real ID friends will appear under their real life names on your friends list when
5449080	5452560	chatting, communicating in game, or viewing a character's profile.
5452560	5458320	Real ID friends can also see who's on each other's real ID friends list, making it easy
5458320	5460280	for players to connect with other people they know.
5460280	5461480	I hate that.
5461480	5463080	I'm not going to use this.
5463080	5464880	I don't want people to know my full name.
5464880	5466160	I use a fake name here on the show.
5466160	5469640	I realize some people do, but it's kind of one of those like, you know, I don't really
5469640	5470640	like to advertise it.
5470640	5472200	I don't want to be found that easy.
5472200	5473200	You know what I mean?
5473200	5477420	I can't imagine that they're going to force you to use your real name, that there won't
5477420	5480160	be some sort of option to use a fake name.
5480160	5484900	Also, maybe they'll go by what your account name, whatever you put for that.
5484900	5489880	And I have used multiple accounts on WoW and I have used random names.
5489880	5492160	So I think I had to use my real name.
5492160	5495480	I think I might have tried to put my just my last initial and that's what I would like.
5495480	5498880	I don't care if it's my real last initial, but I don't want, I don't want somebody to
5498880	5504400	Google my name and find all my WoW characters, especially with what I named some of them.
5504400	5505400	Okay.
5505400	5507960	It's not, I don't need my students at work doing that.
5507960	5508960	Sassy pants?
5508960	5509960	Sure.
5509960	5516640	So anyway, I don't know, I'm just, it's kind of irritated.
5516640	5519640	Allen is saying that they're taking it from the billing name of the credit card.
5519640	5520680	That's ridiculous.
5520680	5525320	And if it's true that they're trying to connect it with Facebook, that's even worse because
5525320	5529440	sorry, I just got sent another picture of everybody in ponchos and I'm laughing.
5529440	5536720	There needs to be, honestly that, that's a, I even have to say that's a violation of privacy.
5536720	5537720	It totally is.
5537720	5540000	I really hope that can be suppressed.
5540000	5542640	I hope Blizzard is not that stupid.
5542640	5546400	Blizzard, if you're listening, I hope you are not that stupid.
5546400	5549440	That'll make you pay $25 to change it.
5549440	5552040	Will I get a pony with it?
5552040	5553040	Probably.
5553040	5554040	We'll see.
5554040	5555040	Or a pet.
5555040	5556040	Alright.
5556040	5557040	More breaking news.
5557040	5558040	Will there be more breaking news throughout the show?
5558040	5559040	I don't know.
5559040	5560040	It should have been a game.
5560040	5561040	Like, how many breaking news interruptions will there be tonight?
5561040	5562040	It's a crazy night.
5562040	5565240	Alright guys, let's get back into some gaming news.
5565240	5567280	We're gonna do some quick stories here.
5567280	5568280	Loki and myself.
5568280	5569840	Jamie's sitting out tonight because of her voice.
5569840	5571760	Loki, go ahead and let's get to some quick news.
5571760	5574160	Uh, Portal 2.
5574160	5578160	Just like the party that they were gonna have for Portal 2.
5578160	5579160	It's been delayed.
5579160	5581880	Well, the party got cancelled.
5581880	5583080	Game delayed though.
5583080	5585560	Not coming out until 2011.
5585560	5587160	And that's too bad.
5587160	5589000	Oh well.
5589000	5592900	Game though that is coming out over here, also in 2011, which is kind of a surprise
5592900	5598600	seeing as the last game hasn't sold very well at all.
5598600	5606120	Um, Yakuza 4 is slated to be heading to North America and Europe in Spring 2011.
5606120	5613960	Hopefully, they do not cut out a ton of stuff like they did with Yakuza 3.
5613960	5622320	Final Fantasy 9 is making its way to Playstation Network next week.
5622320	5626720	And personally, 9 was my least favorite on the Playstation.
5626720	5630440	But hey, if you still wanna buy it, it's only gonna be $10.
5630440	5631440	And that'll be out.
5631440	5634600	Uh, did you forget about Final Fantasy 8?
5634600	5635600	That's a great game.
5635600	5637240	A great game to make fun of.
5637240	5638240	Whatever.
5638240	5639240	That game is 8 better than 9.
5639240	5640240	Yeah, 9 is terrible.
5640240	5642080	What is wrong with you people?
5642080	5648120	Avivi was cool, Nquinna was funny, and the game sucked.
5648120	5651260	I'm doing a show with insane people.
5651260	5653400	And you've just learned this now after what?
5653400	5654400	How many episodes?
5654400	5655400	370.
5655400	5656400	Yeah.
5656400	5659240	So, yeah, next Tuesday.
5659240	5660240	That'll be coming out.
5660240	5666080	Finally, they're teasing something related to a Potapon beta test.
5666080	5670040	This apparently is counting down.
5670040	5671800	Doesn't say when it's supposed to end.
5671800	5674600	I'm guessing sometime next week.
5674600	5676960	I hope that's hours and not days.
5676960	5678960	I don't know.
5678960	5682720	Well, during E3 would kinda be the time to do it, so.
5682720	5684560	It's on the Japanese site.
5684560	5687840	And it's interesting though, maybe it's gonna have online multiplayer.
5687840	5690840	Obviously, if they're doing a beta test, it's probably gonna have online multiplayer because
5690840	5695400	they have to stress their servers, but I don't know.
5695400	5697360	Not really seeing anything on the countdown site.
5697360	5709720	But yeah, if you want to check it out, it's www.jp.com, s-c-e-j slash marusen, m-a-r-u-s-e-n.
5709720	5711760	It's down to 86, so it must be hours.
5711760	5712920	Yes, it's hours.
5712920	5716200	So that would probably be sometime this week during E3.
5716200	5717200	Surprise.
5717200	5719480	Perhaps their press conference time?
5719480	5720480	Maybe around?
5720480	5721480	I don't know.
5721480	5722480	About three days?
5722480	5723480	Yeah, maybe.
5723480	5724480	Let's see.
5724480	5725480	All right.
5725480	5726480	Moving on to some other news.
5726480	5727480	Puzzle Quest.
5727480	5728880	Yes, the news keeps coming on Puzzle Quest.
5728880	5730200	Actually, this is great.
5730200	5734660	Chapters one and two are free on the iPhone right now.
5734660	5737880	So if you want to grab free Puzzle Quest, you gotta do it right now.
5737880	5741160	I don't know how long this is available for, but I believe it's just the weekend.
5741160	5744240	So unfortunately, those of you listening to the podcast Monday morning, this sale may
5744240	5745600	already be over.
5745600	5749600	But yeah, chapters one and two of Puzzle Quest, they split it up on the iPhone.
5749600	5750600	It's free right now.
5750600	5755520	Now, if you actually get all the way to the third chapter, it's gonna cost you $1.99 for
5755520	5756520	the third chapter.
5756520	5758840	But really, is it gonna hold your attention that long?
5758840	5762640	I got to the training dummy and then I stopped.
5762640	5766780	It's a little wonky on the iPhone because I did play that a little bit.
5766780	5772480	And my problem with it on the iPhone is that my 3G is not built to play a game like that.
5772480	5776000	It will be better on that new iPhone 4 or whatever's coming out in a couple weeks.
5776000	5777920	I have a 3GS, so I'll see how it does on mine.
5777920	5779360	It'll probably do a little better with yours.
5779360	5781720	What did you think about the iPhone 4?
5781720	5783000	It looks amazing.
5783000	5785280	Do you really want to get in that discussion, Loki?
5785280	5786520	Yeah, sure.
5786520	5787800	I'm gonna get one, absolutely.
5787800	5792320	Well, my contract, I'm one of those people where my contract is up in October usually.
5792320	5796400	So I get the whole retro deal or whatever from AT&T where I can upgrade and it's coming
5796400	5798000	out right in time for my birthday.
5798000	5799660	But you know, I need a faster phone.
5799660	5803240	Like a lot of the apps are really hurting on the old phone and you know, just for the
5803240	5804240	technology to catch up.
5804240	5806160	I love the idea of a front-facing camera.
5806160	5808080	I think the video conferencing is going to be fun.
5808080	5810560	It'll be a fun little toy to have.
5810560	5814200	What did you think about the motion controllers or the new stuff?
5814200	5815200	With gyroscope?
5815200	5816720	We're going to get layer on it.
5816720	5819120	I'm curious to see how it's going to be implemented.
5819120	5822440	But I'm a little worried though because I know I'm going to get these video phone calls
5822440	5823440	from Miklatov.
5823440	5825040	Miklatov's going to call me on video.
5825040	5828720	He's going to be like, look, my Pokemon evolved.
5828720	5829720	Unless it's adorable.
5829720	5831120	Will I do that?
5831120	5832120	He'll totally do it.
5832120	5833800	I'll only do it when I get black and white.
5833800	5835760	And video editing on live.
5835760	5838060	The HD camera thing is pretty cool.
5838060	5841080	I'm actually surprised you of all people asked this, Loki.
5841080	5842680	Are you interested in this phone call?
5842680	5848560	No, I was watching the live blog because there was really nothing going on this week.
5848560	5857240	So it was kind of like my, I guess, preparation for the live blogs and conferences and stuff
5857240	5859040	like that that are coming this week.
5859040	5860960	Kind of the prep course.
5860960	5861960	I'm sorry.
5861960	5865680	Bobby, I just stopped listening to this show because Bobby sent me a link here on Twitter.
5865680	5866680	Another Twit pic.
5866680	5869960	That is itagaki in a space poncho.
5869960	5873000	I need a live journal icon of this immediately.
5873000	5874680	Dark Sakura, can you help?
5874680	5877680	It's itagaki in the space poncho.
5877680	5878880	Send it to me.
5878880	5880680	Space poncho itagaki.
5880680	5882400	That's all you need.
5882400	5883400	I love it.
5883400	5886880	He's kind of looking up like, behold, the future is in my poncho.
5886880	5891320	Oh, this is great.
5891320	5892320	I'm sorry.
5892320	5894440	I'm having to distract Shane for a moment.
5894440	5898480	Perhaps we can, uh, I had to show him my favorite car ever.
5898480	5899840	This Microsoft is genius.
5899840	5902040	They're getting all these celebrities to put on space ponchos.
5902040	5903040	Look at this.
5903040	5904040	Look at this.
5904040	5905040	Felicia day in a space poncho.
5905040	5906040	There you go.
5906040	5907040	Itagaki.
5907040	5908040	I'll make you.
5908040	5909040	I just did take your private message.
5909040	5910040	I'm going to make one of him.
5910040	5911720	This is in the ponchos as space rock star.
5911720	5916460	Hey, you want to know something, uh, or kind of a funny game we should play?
5916460	5920240	How much will these space ponchos go for on eBay?
5920240	5924620	I hope they're covered in watermelon.
5924620	5927560	You know, that's probably just going to be some sort of light showing or reflect off
5927560	5928640	the space poncho.
5928640	5931700	They better like make you turn those in on the way out because they have another show
5931700	5932700	tomorrow night.
5932700	5934420	We could have worn the space ponchos.
5934420	5938720	You know, if you don't go to work, we still laugh at you.
5938720	5940400	I would have been like breaking news.
5940400	5947820	We could take emo pictures like the first few people that had them see ditch work or
5947820	5952080	space poncho ditch work or space poncho.
5952080	5953080	Now it's a tough call.
5953080	5955400	I get it that those would be the same thing.
5955400	5956400	So I'm sorry.
5956400	5957600	Work or space poncho.
5957600	5963440	The only way that this could possibly be cooler is if they had a Conan O'Brien there and he
5963440	5969880	just starts doing in the year 2000 because that would be awesome.
5969880	5973040	I wonder if they're branded at all and if they don't make you turn them in, they could
5973040	5974040	probably go for a lot.
5974040	5976320	It's probably like the glasses after Captain EO.
5976320	5981080	There'll be a large man standing there making you deposit them in the bin or he will rough
5981080	5982080	you up.
5982080	5983080	What is that?
5983080	5984080	Captain EO at Disneyland.
5984080	5986280	Do you remember the honey I shrunk the audience thing?
5986280	5987680	That thing was weird.
5987680	5988680	Okay.
5988680	5992080	Imagine that with an 80s movie starring Michael Jackson.
5992080	5993680	It's the greatest motion picture ever made.
5993680	5996720	I can't believe that for a second.
5996720	5997840	It's coming back.
5997840	5998840	It's there.
5998840	5999840	I saw it a couple weeks ago.
5999840	6000840	It's amazing.
6000840	6005120	They brought it back after Michael Jackson kicked it.
6005120	6006120	Yes.
6006120	6007120	After he beat it.
6007120	6011560	After they realized that honey, I struck the kids, wait, we haven't done that in a long
6011560	6012560	time.
6012560	6016480	I have to say that the honey I shrunk the audience was pretty fun because it had Eric
6016480	6018120	Idol in it.
6018120	6019640	Bobby Black Wolf in our chat room.
6019640	6023640	Bobby is pointing out a, usually you can keep stuff from Ms press conferences.
6023640	6026840	I still have the ass cushion they gave us in 2007.
6026840	6027840	It's in my garage.
6027840	6030000	What was that used for?
6030000	6033760	Well, I noticed it gives you hemorrhoids.
6033760	6039840	Well, if that's, that's the same, there was the one that was, this 360 is so great.
6039840	6041720	My eight is is flaring.
6041720	6050120	I went to the 360, um, uh, dealie, uh, where they had us, uh, with the headphones and they
6050120	6052800	didn't let us keep the headphones, but they were expensive.
6052800	6055860	Well, these are from the future, these space ponchos.
6055860	6057440	So they might be expensive too.
6057440	6060920	So if I called in sick to work tomorrow, I might get in trouble and get a writeup, but
6060920	6062120	I would get a space poncho.
6062120	6065520	It could be worth it, but see, here's the thing.
6065520	6066520	Okay.
6066520	6069720	I think I have like a couple of coworkers who listen to this show now and the bad thing
6069720	6072640	is I'm actually legitimately getting sick.
6072640	6075100	So if I do call into work tomorrow, it's not for space poncho.
6075100	6078340	It's because I'm sick, but now they're going to go around telling people, Oh, if you listen
6078340	6083080	to Rob show, he called in sick cause he wants to go get a space poncho and then they'll understand
6083080	6085000	either way.
6085000	6089240	No, actually my coworkers are pretty cool.
6089240	6092280	They'd be like, as long as I get as long as you wear it to work.
6092280	6098080	Most of my coworkers, like most of my coworkers are like, you do a radio show.
6098080	6100560	I wonder if I could wear that to work.
6100560	6104720	It's like, yeah, I've worn Santa hats before.
6104720	6107160	I can't see how that's any different.
6107160	6109960	Just come back from LA and show up to work in your space poncho.
6109960	6115560	What you need to do is you need to go around E3 gathering parts to this grand costume that
6115560	6117560	you will wear through E3.
6117560	6121800	Well, it's going to be mostly lanyards probably.
6121800	6124080	Lanyards and space poncho.
6124080	6127040	Black Wolf and Chat says, I've never heard that they're doing this event again though,
6127040	6128040	but we have an invite.
6128040	6129040	Yeah.
6129040	6130040	We have tickets for tomorrow.
6130040	6134240	Yeah, but we're just not going, but now I kind of want to go grab the space poncho and
6134240	6135240	leave.
6135240	6137600	Ooh, it's a good idea.
6137600	6138600	I don't know what it is.
6138600	6140160	It's a repeat for fans or something, right?
6140160	6141160	Yeah.
6141160	6144120	It was a higher Cirque du Soleil and the blackout on TVs till Tuesday, I think there's a reason
6144120	6145120	for it.
6145120	6146120	They're probably doing fans tomorrow or something.
6146120	6147120	Yeah.
6147120	6152900	It was something through, I guess, the campus that they're holding it on and they were giving
6152900	6156560	away tickets to the public and we scored a couple.
6156560	6157560	That's cool.
6157560	6158560	Space poncho.
6158560	6159560	All right.
6159560	6162920	By the way, we were supposed to be doing news and Black Wolf says, are you sure it's tomorrow?
6162920	6163920	Yes.
6163920	6167360	A hundred times because this is the same question Rob asked me.
6167360	6168360	Yeah.
6168360	6169800	And I put him through the whole interrogation too.
6169800	6172000	I'm like, okay, well, are you sure it's not Sunday?
6172000	6177280	But no, it's Monday at the same place, so it's not the press conference, it's the same
6177280	6180760	place and it's called the Natal reveal or whatever.
6180760	6184760	And if it's not, I'm sure I've gotten a text about it now saying, oh crap, you guys, it's
6184760	6186800	tonight, not tomorrow.
6186800	6188240	Yeah, exactly.
6188240	6192880	So I don't know what that's all about, but they're doing it.
6192880	6194200	Black Wolf's like, are you sure?
6194200	6195600	Yeah, I saw that.
6195600	6201280	I'm as sure as I can be without actually being there and seeing the tickets, but my contact,
6201280	6202280	you know, I trust.
6202280	6205560	Megalotov in a space poncho says yes, it's true.
6205560	6206560	All right.
6206560	6207560	Anyway.
6207560	6208560	Are you sure you're positive?
6208560	6209560	Okay.
6209560	6210560	Come on.
6210560	6211560	Let's, let's move on.
6211560	6212560	All right.
6212560	6213560	Other stuff.
6213560	6214560	Civilization five has a release date.
6214560	6215560	Yay.
6215560	6216920	September 21st is when Civ five is coming out in North America.
6216920	6220760	24th is when it will come out internationally, which means it will be pirated internationally
6220760	6223520	on the 21st.
6223520	6225840	This is the civilization that has hexagons in it.
6225840	6228080	Basically there'll be more information at E3 next week.
6228080	6231320	You know, I'm going to be checking this out because I loves me some civilization.
6231320	6232960	All right.
6232960	6238920	Duke Nukem Manhattan project is a real, it's coming to Xbox live for 10 bucks on June 23rd.
6238920	6241280	A little trailer hit the internet this week.
6241280	6244160	And uh, I believe what, this is a 2d game, right?
6244160	6246240	So this is actually kind of retro graphics.
6246240	6247240	Yeah.
6247240	6249600	So it's 3d, but it's a 2d side-scroller action.
6249600	6252440	It's kind of where the 2d games are going these days, right?
6252440	6260880	That's cool, but it's not Duke Nukem forever.
6260880	6263800	Let's still kind of be, cause if you remember Duke Nukem's roots were a 2d game.
6263800	6267320	I think a lot of people forget that Duke Nukem was a 2d game first.
6267320	6269240	Where's my Halloween Harry remake.
6269240	6273080	It's a good day to die.
6273080	6274080	All right.
6274080	6275080	Good stuff.
6275080	6277680	You may remember, and since this isn't our show roll, I'll talk about it.
6277680	6284120	You may remember there was a lawsuit filed against the people working on Duke Nukem forever
6284120	6287960	because they took too damn long and uh, that's been settled.
6287960	6292640	So perhaps Duke Nukem news in the future, maybe?
6292640	6296880	And actually, um, I don't remember if we can get into that later.
6296880	6297880	Nevermind.
6297880	6298880	Oh no, no, no, we're not.
6298880	6303160	Um, actually, uh, one other thing, uh, kind of going back to when we were talking about
6303160	6311800	Rock Band 3, uh, there was also, remember, a lawsuit, um, against, uh, MTV games and
6311800	6315880	harmonics for, uh, Rock Band and from Gibson.
6315880	6320920	And that's been settled because you know who's making the super pro, uh, guitar controller?
6320920	6321920	Gibson.
6321920	6322920	So.
6322920	6325960	Here's a random game.
6325960	6329200	Super Dimension Game Neptune apparently is a new game coming out.
6329200	6330920	It's a Japanese role playing game.
6330920	6334480	It's about game consoles who transform into anime girls.
6334480	6336180	I am not making this up.
6336180	6340220	It stars such people as Purple Heart, Green Heart, White Heart, and Black Heart.
6340220	6341720	That's so, uh, imaginative.
6341720	6347120	Uh, they're gonna fight Magicon, which I guess is the villain in the game.
6347120	6350680	It's basically like, um, an R4 device type thing.
6350680	6353360	Well, it's, uh, Nippon Ichi who does Disgaea.
6353360	6354360	They are a part of this.
6354360	6355360	So is Compile Heart.
6355360	6357560	Uh, they do Agarest Reward.
6357560	6359480	Uh, lots of interesting things there.
6359480	6362960	Apparently classic Sega characters are supposed to show up in the game.
6362960	6368120	Space Harrier, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd are like the summons in this game from the Nettoons.
6368120	6369120	That's awesome.
6369120	6370120	And apparently, here's the thing.
6370120	6371120	I'm getting this.
6371120	6373280	You can also use images from your Playstation 3 photo library.
6373280	6374280	I'm getting this.
6374280	6377080	It's a PS3 exclusive, which means region free, kids.
6377080	6378080	I'm getting this.
6378080	6379080	Sounds pretty awesome.
6379080	6382860	Wasn't the Neptune a code name for one of the Sega systems anyways?
6382860	6383860	That's kind of ironic.
6383860	6384860	I believe it was.
6384860	6385860	Yes, it was.
6385860	6386860	Good stuff.
6386860	6390560	Uh, the Dreamcast's code name.
6390560	6393440	Uh, Marissa Congusto in chat.
6393440	6394440	Hi Marissa.
6394440	6396720	Says Gibson, referring to the earlier story.
6396720	6397720	Gibson?
6397720	6400800	Does that mean it's going to be insanely expensive and elitist?
6400800	6401800	Yes.
6401800	6402800	Yes.
6402800	6407240	Let's get into some more gaming news and talk about some of the other big news that came
6407240	6408240	up this week.
6408240	6409480	Believe it or not, we haven't covered it all.
6409480	6412760	Uh, big announcements out of one studio here locally, right?
6412760	6413760	Yeah.
6413760	6418120	So games has announced that they're going to be doing some more episodic games.
6418120	6422820	One franchise they are now going to be creating games for is Jurassic Park.
6422820	6427120	They have struck a deal with NBC Universal to develop games based on the media giant's
6427120	6432360	properties and Michael Crichton's, you know, dinosaurs in a modern day franchise being
6432360	6435360	the first to get the interactive treatment.
6435360	6439360	You know, I wonder if since they've striked a deal with NBC Universal, if we'll get like
6439360	6442040	an office game or something like that.
6442040	6444080	An episodic office thing.
6444080	6445800	I actually really like this music.
6445800	6451000	I love the music in Jurassic Park, which is great because like it's such a terrorist like
6451000	6455520	movie, not like actually about terrorists, but those dinosaurs like rip people in half
6455520	6459920	and listen to the music.
6459920	6461640	I was like, did you ever read the book?
6461640	6465160	I did actually, believe it or not, I read the original Jurassic Park book.
6465160	6468560	I did not read the lost world, but I did see the movie because I thought it was weird that
6468560	6472760	he made a book sequel to a movie because like different characters died in the original
6472760	6473760	book.
6473760	6474760	Yeah.
6474760	6475760	Like everybody died in the original book.
6475760	6480720	Like I can't like spoilers in the book died and then he's suddenly back.
6480720	6482920	There's a six month thing on spoilers after six months.
6482920	6483920	It's okay.
6483920	6485840	And that let's see how long ago is that book written?
6485840	6487840	Like in the eighties?
6487840	6489320	Yeah.
6489320	6492200	That's a very interesting franchise to bring back.
6492200	6493200	Don't you think?
6493200	6497160	I think they should do more movies to be honest, because granted the third movie sucked, but
6497160	6501000	Hey, we're past that now it's been countless number of years, well, not countless, but
6501000	6502000	a lot of years.
6502000	6504440	Wasn't the fourth one kind of like held up in the works for awhile?
6504440	6508680	But they should have, I mean, they had the whole thing where, Oh, the ship, you know,
6508680	6511280	was on autopilot and landed on the mainland or whatever.
6511280	6515120	And there's dinosaurs in there and maybe they, some of them escaped and now they're breeding,
6515120	6517320	you know, that would make an interesting story.
6517320	6520560	You know, dinosaurs on the mainland, you know, that'd be kind of cool.
6520560	6522640	Jurassic park was actually kind of an awesome movie.
6522640	6525460	Like I remember when it first came out, a lot of people didn't like it, but like kids
6525460	6528820	our age at that time, which had been like teenagers and stuff had my birthday party
6528820	6529960	centered around it.
6529960	6533600	When it came out and we'd see it, we went, I, let me tell you how long ago this movie
6533600	6534600	came out.
6534600	6535600	You ready?
6535600	6536600	Ready?
6536600	6539860	I went to the dollar movies with my girlfriend to see Jurassic park and I had to hold her
6539860	6541800	hand because she was so scared.
6541800	6545720	Remember when the dinosaur is looking through like that diner door thing at one of the little
6545720	6549120	girls and he snorts, he snorts, like she screamed.
6549120	6550160	It was so funny.
6550160	6551720	Why is she afraid of snort?
6551720	6554920	Well, I think she's afraid of killer dinosaurs that will rip her in half.
6554920	6559120	Cause you remember the, the dinosaur like ate that guy in the toilet, sitting on toilet,
6559120	6565400	sitting on another universal, uh, movie property that that's going to get the game treatment
6565400	6566400	as well.
6566400	6568200	And that's so awesome.
6568200	6573440	Back to the future is getting some episodic games as well.
6573440	6574600	That's kind of awesome too.
6574600	6579160	What, what the hell tell tale like, and I mean that in a good way, like where the hell
6579160	6580680	did this come from?
6580680	6585920	Like all them nerds at telltale and I say that in the most loving and daring way, all
6585920	6590480	them nerds at telltale must have been sitting in the boardroom one day going, all right,
6590480	6594040	what like fucking nerdy, awesome things should we bring back?
6594040	6597000	And somebody was like back to the future and somebody else said, fuck yeah.
6597000	6600520	And there it was, where's day of the tentacle.
6600520	6603160	We need more day of the tentacle.
6603160	6604160	Back to the future.
6604160	6606720	Wasn't that actually a point and click game back in the day?
6606720	6609640	I seem to recall there was a Lucas arts back to the future game.
6609640	6610640	I don't know.
6610640	6611880	Wait, what did it have been Lucas arts?
6611880	6613320	No, there was some sites.
6613320	6618080	I thought there was, there was some side scrolling games on the NES that really sucked.
6618080	6620540	But um, well actually the first one was all right.
6620540	6625640	The second one back to future two and three was terrible.
6625640	6629240	Well Jurassic park also had video games, which Jurassic park games were awesome.
6629240	6630240	Yeah, they were really fun.
6630240	6633200	I thought the super Nintendo one was scary as fuck.
6633200	6637000	I liked playing the arcade when we sit in because I used to, I've several times found
6637000	6638000	that machine on accident.
6638000	6640280	I think that was fun.
6640280	6641280	Pretty awesome.
6641280	6642280	The arcade one is sweet.
6642280	6646760	The, uh, super Nintendo one, which is kind of top down, they went to like almost a Wolfenstein
6646760	6647760	mode.
6647760	6650480	And then the Genesis one where you play as a dinosaur.
6650480	6652280	That was cool.
6652280	6653280	That was awesome.
6653280	6656320	I love the super Nintendo one with that whole first person shooter thing.
6656320	6660360	And then like the dinosaurs would just jump out of nowhere and like, although because
6660360	6664360	the super Nintendo's capability was so limited, you had like this little tiny goggles thing
6664360	6667960	on the screen to see it was, it was kind of sad.
6667960	6669920	But it used surround sound.
6669920	6672940	It was one of the first games I had surround sound in it, although I was too poor for that.
6672940	6676320	I thought it was awesome that it was surround sound on.
6676320	6679880	Is it pro logic, I guess, because you know, it only had stereo output.
6679880	6681760	It was one of their old, old, old, old ones.
6681760	6685900	I don't know if it was like simulated cue sound or whatever, but they, it was an old
6685900	6691380	version of a, it must've been, um, pro logic cause that's the only, but obviously now it's
6691380	6692380	coming from telltale.
6692380	6695160	It's probably gonna be more of a point and click games will be nothing like any of those
6695160	6696160	games.
6696160	6701800	But it was pro logic cause I remember, um, running it through our, uh, our receiver.
6701800	6704240	So good time to the back to the future game.
6704240	6706280	I mean, there's, there's gonna be a lot of love for that.
6706280	6707280	Excited about that.
6707280	6710720	He told me last night and he was looking pretty giddy.
6710720	6714680	Dude, you need to get Christopher Lloyd in and record a bunch of voice work because that
6714680	6716600	guy is not getting any younger.
6716600	6717720	Good idea.
6717720	6722840	Same, you know, with Michael J Fox to get him in there in the studio cause he is not
6722840	6724640	getting any younger.
6724640	6727160	I have some trivia for you.
6727160	6731360	We have about, well, we had for a while back to the future pinball table and if you look
6731360	6737680	at it, Michael J Fox's face is not on it because he would not lend the, uh, his likeness to
6737680	6738840	make the pinball table.
6738840	6739840	That's right.
6739840	6741560	It's like what happened with Paula Abdul in that American Idol game.
6741560	6744560	Who was supposed to play him before it wasn't it Jason Bateman?
6744560	6748280	No, it was Eric Roberts or something like that.
6748280	6749920	It was, I forget.
6749920	6753320	Yeah, no, Jason Bateman played the sequel Teen Wolf.
6753320	6759800	Teen Wolf 2 and Teen Wolf, the TV series coming to MTV.
6759800	6761160	Awful.
6761160	6766160	Speaking of awesome sounding games coming out soon, there is a SpongeBob SquarePants
6766160	6768280	MMO.
6768280	6769280	Shoot me in the head.
6769280	6770520	No, it's awesome.
6770520	6775200	Here's my reply to that.
6775200	6777680	What do you have against SpongeBob SquarePants?
6777680	6778680	All of you.
6778680	6779680	What is your problem with SpongeBob SquarePants?
6779680	6780680	It's dumb.
6780680	6781680	I'm not interested in mental retardation.
6781680	6783480	I don't have a problem with it.
6783480	6784680	The show's okay.
6784680	6785680	It just grows on you.
6785680	6791960	When I flew to New York once, I watched SpongeBob SquarePants the entire way and it went a little
6791960	6816440	something like this.
6816440	6820040	SpongeBob SquarePants belongs to that whole time frame of Nickelodeon kid shows that were
6820040	6822280	actually awful.
6822280	6824160	Shut your mouth.
6824160	6827340	It will be coming out in 2011, but here's the thing.
6827340	6832440	It's coming out for China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and India.
6832440	6836560	No word about it coming to the US.
6836560	6840480	You will have an online store where you can purchase your own items, meaning it sounds
6840480	6843700	like it could be a free MMO, especially considering it's being developed for the Asian realms
6843700	6847000	where that tends to be the more popular method of development.
6847000	6848000	Awesome.
6848000	6852320	Tell that to all the people in Second Life.
6852320	6855240	DarkSakura, what do you have for us since y'all are hating on SpongeBob?
6855240	6859920	I have something cool, actually cool kind of.
6859920	6867320	Street Fighter IV might be having, well actually there might be a motion sensing Street Fighter
6867320	6869000	game in the works.
6869000	6877040	It was actually Yoshinori Ono, who's the producer of Street Fighter IV, was saying that it could
6877040	6878040	actually happen.
6878040	6882160	That he was interested in motion sensing ever since the Wii was launched, but he didn't
6882160	6885280	think that Street Fighter fit the play.
6885280	6887160	But he's still interested in doing something.
6887160	6892400	He mentioned something called wanting to do a Street Fighter fit or Street Fighter exercise.
6892400	6899360	That's more of a motion sensing game, not necessarily a fighting game.
6899360	6906200	So I have everything else Street Fighter, I may as well get that too.
6906200	6910600	It's I don't know, I'm worried it's going to be in that same bin as like what was it
6910600	6911760	Virtual Street Fighter?
6911760	6912760	What was it Street Fighter EX?
6912760	6913760	Was that what it was called?
6913760	6914760	Yeah, Street Fighter EX.
6914760	6918240	That really terrible Street Fighter game, it was really bad you guys, really bad.
6918240	6919240	I kind of liked it.
6919240	6920720	I actually liked EX too.
6920720	6921720	Really?
6921720	6925920	Yeah, I actually for a long, I managed to get it to run on a 486.
6925920	6926920	Wow.
6926920	6929120	The first EX, sorry.
6929120	6930120	That's old school.
6930120	6931820	We have breaking news Rob.
6931820	6932820	Do we really?
6932820	6933820	Yes.
6933820	6935160	I keep closing the theme song though, I'm not ready.
6935160	6937200	You have to warn me when you're going to have breaking news.
6937200	6939480	I just did.
6939480	6941480	I gave you warnings.
6941480	6942480	A few seconds.
6942480	6947160	Alright, well hold on, we've got to wake up the orchestra and get them to warm up.
6947160	6959520	Alright, here we go guys, breaking news.
6959520	6965160	Starting from a credible source according to IGN, Retro Studios is creating a Donkey
6965160	6966160	Kong title.
6966160	6971560	That's right, the folks behind Metroid Prime are making a Donkey Kong game.
6971560	6972920	That's going to be weird.
6972920	6973920	Huh.
6973920	6975560	First person Donkey Kong.
6975560	6977680	Okay, that could be interesting.
6977680	6980280	I don't know how you feel about that.
6980280	6982380	Do you have to play that with the bongo drums?
6982380	6983800	There are no bongo drums.
6983800	6984800	Like Donkey Kong?
6984800	6988240	Do you think that might be a surprise announcement at E3 then?
6988240	6989240	Perhaps.
6989240	6990240	You know what's happening?
6990240	6992440	People are overhearing shit at E3 now.
6992440	6995040	That's what's happening is that you get all these nerds together and people who work in
6995040	6997480	the industry and like people can't help but gossip with each other.
6997480	7001180	Like one year, didn't we hear people talking about was the year that Activision acquired
7001180	7002180	Red Octane.
7002180	7004880	We totally overheard people talking about the acquisition and everything that worked
7004880	7006920	for the companies.
7006920	7010060	You never know who's going to be listening folks, just saying.
7010060	7013080	People started acting goofy when they were wearing, you know, space ponchos.
7013080	7015440	See, this is crazy.
7015440	7016440	I deserve that.
7016440	7019760	You should see the Donkey Kong game we're making.
7019760	7020760	What's up with that?
7020760	7023240	Pick an executive, take him out for drinks.
7023240	7025240	There you go.
7025240	7030160	Alright, Loki, what other non-breaking news, although it is recent news, do you have for
7030160	7031160	us?
7031160	7032160	Then by the way, we're going to do a triple threat.
7032160	7035040	We're going to do Twitter topics, mailbag, and FUs of the Week all back to back to back
7035040	7037520	here in just a moment.
7037520	7043120	As previously rumored, the Dreamcast games are making their way to the PlayStation Network
7043120	7045960	and Xbox Live arcade.
7045960	7050480	As digital downloads, in celebration of the 11th anniversary of the Dreamcast, I just
7050480	7055400	think it's a convenient timing if you ask me, apparently one of the first games coming
7055400	7057800	out will be Sonic Adventure.
7057800	7062840	Also Crazy Taxi is confirmed to be coming as well.
7062840	7064640	Sonic Adventure and Noah's definitely out.
7064640	7065640	Crazy Taxi!
7065640	7071720	Because Sonic Adventure already leaked out, just a hint.
7071720	7072720	It's guys.
7072720	7075880	We just need Jet Set and we're good.
7075880	7078720	And Phantasy Star Online, the first ones.
7078720	7081440	Oh, that'd be kind of cool.
7081440	7084760	That would be actually really cool if Phantasy Star Online kind of came back, but on Xbox
7084760	7085760	a little bit.
7085760	7087240	There's still private servers, Rob.
7087240	7088920	There's Phantasy Star Universe, too.
7088920	7091460	We don't talk about that terrible game.
7091460	7092760	It's not that bad.
7092760	7093760	It's awful.
7093760	7094760	Ugh.
7094760	7097760	Alright, every week we encourage you guys to send us emails.
7097760	7102480	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read a few of them here live on air.
7102480	7103480	Why?
7103480	7107720	Because we can and we love you.
7107720	7111160	Now usually DarkSakura dives in and reads the emails, but because she's under doctor's
7111160	7113440	orders tonight, she's not going to read the emails.
7113440	7114440	I am!
7114440	7115440	Muahahaha!
7115440	7121080	Alright, but DarkSakura can feel free to comment, but she won't be criticizing spelling and
7121080	7123920	grammar, sadly, because she can't.
7123920	7129120	Alright, and plus I don't have good spelling and grammar, so I wouldn't be able to criticize
7129120	7130120	you anyway.
7130120	7131120	Let's get to the first email.
7131120	7137120	The first email from our good pal, friend, buddy, RubbaBubbaBubba is emailing us because
7137120	7140200	he wants to tell us about season two of The Tester.
7140200	7147120	Now, I realize a lot of people gave The Tester shit, and somewhat rightfully so, but it wasn't
7147120	7150000	as terrible as I think some people made it out to be.
7150000	7152480	I think a lot of people who really criticized it didn't watch it.
7152480	7154440	It wasn't the worst reality show I've ever seen.
7154440	7158280	I mean, didn't one of those chicks on The Real Housewives get a spinoff show?
7158280	7159280	Like...
7159280	7160280	I think a few of them.
7160280	7163440	When you're gonna hate The Tester, when there's that, I mean, just sayin'.
7163440	7167720	So anyway, he wanted to write us to say, there is a casting call about to begin for season
7167720	7168720	two of The Tester.
7168720	7175240	The prize this year seems to be a one-year contract with Sony, and a $10,000 cash prize.
7175240	7178360	Hey, Miklotov, I found you a new job.
7178360	7179360	Yeah, right.
7179360	7181800	W, you've always wanted to be on a reality show, right?
7181800	7182800	You could do this.
7182800	7183800	No, I'm just Survivor.
7183800	7184800	Www.TheTester.com.
7184800	7187800	Well, this is kind of like Survivor, but not really.
7187800	7192360	No, but I know what being a tester is like, and I would not do that again.
7192360	7194280	You just get the $10,000 prize and quit.
7194280	7195840	But I don't know, you're in a contract.
7195840	7197560	I guess that's true, huh?
7197560	7200480	Maybe I could be really bad so they could break me of my contract.
7200480	7208680	He also links us to a demonstration of the casting call at PlayStation-staging.gotcast.com.
7208680	7211160	You wanna read the rules and all that stuff and get a video ready?
7211160	7213220	I believe they're due any day now.
7213220	7217160	I'd like to see someone from OLR, even All Games, kind of get in on this, so I have someone
7217160	7218160	to root for.
7218160	7220160	But, uh, I won't hold my breath.
7220160	7222000	I think it might be fun, though.
7222000	7224160	Come on, those of you that are on fun employment.
7224160	7226160	I could try, I guess, but I don't want to be a tester.
7226160	7227600	Think about it.
7227600	7228600	Reality show.
7228600	7231440	Yeah, it's so much fun to play the same- I don't think Nellie would be supportive
7231440	7235440	of you leaving her with the new baby for a few weeks to go film this tester show.
7235440	7236440	That'd be dumb, yeah.
7236440	7239760	Nobody seems to understand that you played, like, the same stage over and over again for
7239760	7241560	eight hours a day for, like, a month.
7241560	7244560	And you have to listen to the same song when you're doing steps for, like, a month.
7244560	7246160	So- Yeah, if it's a good song, it's okay.
7246160	7247800	So it's like playing Earth Defense Force.
7247800	7249840	I still haven't played that.
7249840	7250840	I know.
7250840	7251840	I'm missing out.
7251840	7256560	Another email in our mailbag at mailbag at orangeloudtrader.com from Shook.
7256560	7258760	And Shook writes us, hi, OLR.
7258760	7263880	I would personally like to thank Dark Sakura for encouraging me to go back and replay good
7263880	7266480	old Metal Gear Solid for the billionth time.
7266480	7271120	Oh, it's a listener sucking up.
7271120	7272120	Just kidding.
7272120	7273120	That's inappropriate.
7273120	7274120	All right.
7274120	7275120	Thanks to P- I'm just giving him a hard time.
7275120	7276320	Thanks to PS1 Classics.
7276320	7279520	I downloaded it and fell in love with it all over again.
7279520	7281120	Now I'm going to replay the others, too.
7281120	7284280	Thank you for the excellent Game of the Week bit from Shook.
7284280	7285280	Good job, Dark Sakura.
7285280	7287240	A pat on the back and a cookie for Dark Sakura.
7287240	7288240	There you go.
7288240	7291360	But it'll have to be, like, I don't know, like an herb cookie or something because she's
7291360	7292800	on the natural thing.
7292800	7294920	You can get raw cookies.
7294920	7295920	What's that?
7295920	7297320	You can get raw cookies.
7297320	7300680	And keep in mind, I'm 70% raw.
7300680	7301680	All right.
7301680	7302680	Let's see.
7302680	7304920	Also, going to an email from dumunny125.
7304920	7308320	This is our last email tonight, folks, and I'm- oh, this is going to be a great one,
7308320	7309320	Miklata.
7309320	7310320	Hey, OLR.
7310320	7312120	I'm finally sending this email because I got a droid now.
7312120	7315280	Also, now I can listen to your live stream by means of a free app.
7315280	7316280	Yay.
7316280	7318440	You should have told us more information about that app because I always say there's the
7318440	7321880	all games app on iPhone, but I don't know what to say for droid people.
7321880	7323880	So no more Crackberry, but now I have a droid-diction.
7323880	7328000	Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys about Oblivion 5.
7328000	7330880	Now, actually, that would be Elder Scrolls 5.
7330880	7332640	Let's just be real.
7332640	7337120	It's Elder Scrolls, and Oblivion was the fourth game in Elder Scrolls, like Morrowind was
7337120	7338760	the third and so forth.
7338760	7340760	And why are you barfing over there, Miklata?
7340760	7342360	We had this discussion.
7342360	7344760	Yes, but we didn't have it on the air, so you need to repeat yourself.
7344760	7346760	Okay, let's have it real quick.
7346760	7347760	All right.
7347760	7353360	So, if you play, and if they have it there, Elder Scrolls 5, I said that I will throw
7353360	7355640	up because I hate the Elder Scrolls games.
7355640	7356640	Why?
7356640	7357640	They're great.
7357640	7358640	They're boring.
7358640	7359640	They're some of the best games to ever come out for the-
7359640	7360640	Nope.
7360640	7361640	You are.
7361640	7364040	I would rather- Okay, this is what happened.
7364040	7367120	When Morrowind came out, everybody was like, oh, it's the best game ever.
7367120	7370180	I was like, okay, it's gotta be awesome.
7370180	7371180	Everybody says so.
7371180	7373440	I went to Blockbuster and I rented it.
7373440	7379600	I returned it, oh, like an hour later, and they're like, oh, well, you can just get another
7379600	7380600	game.
7380600	7386160	So I got Unlimited Saga, and then I returned it like 20 minutes later, and I just didn't
7386160	7389080	care after that because both of those games were awful.
7389080	7393840	But my point is, Elder Scrolls is so boring.
7393840	7401000	I guess it's because I don't like the fact that you have the main story and you can do
7401000	7402000	whatever you want.
7402000	7403000	That's cool.
7403000	7408320	But it feels a little bit too much like you can do whatever you want, so who cares about
7408320	7409320	the main story?
7409320	7414200	Why don't I just go kill this entire town, or I'll go be a vampire, or something like
7414200	7415200	that.
7415200	7418160	I just don't like them.
7418160	7422840	I do want to get Fallout a try, though, but I don't want to ever play an Elder Scrolls
7422840	7424360	game again.
7424360	7429640	So apparently this whole time, Bobby has been leading an effort to get Space Poncho to trend
7429640	7434800	on Twitter, and he actually got some of the former Gamerscore blog people to start using
7434800	7439160	Space Poncho, and all these people are now using the term Space Poncho on Twitter.
7439160	7441160	That's awesome.
7441160	7444120	We have to go get one tomorrow.
7444120	7445340	I officially endorse this.
7445340	7449440	If you have a Twitter, you need to make a post right now about Space Poncho with a little
7449440	7450440	tweet thing.
7450440	7451440	So we'll see.
7451440	7452440	Oh, four new tweets just popped up.
7452440	7453440	Look at that.
7453440	7457120	And now to make the full circle, we need a picture of President Cat wearing the Space
7457120	7458120	Poncho.
7458120	7462320	Oh, good question from SalaciousPopInChat.
7462320	7464000	Do you like other sandbox games?
7464000	7465480	Give me examples.
7465480	7467520	Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption.
7467520	7468520	No.
7468520	7473080	But my dislike for Red Dead Redemption is because I don't really like the Old West,
7473080	7474280	so the setting just wasn't...
7474280	7476460	So you just don't like sandbox games.
7476460	7477760	You want your games to be linear.
7477760	7483220	Yeah, which might be why I like Final Fantasy XIII so much, because I go forward and I can
7483220	7485440	just attack enemies, and I don't have to do much else.
7485440	7487520	All right, let me go back to Damani's email here.
7487520	7491880	Now, I've never played Oblivion IV until after I played Fallout 3, but I still am really
7491880	7492880	far into the game.
7492880	7495880	I was wondering if they'll ever make a fifth Oblivion, because it seems like they're focusing
7495880	7497400	more on Fallout games now.
7497400	7500080	Now, I do like Fallout more than Oblivion, but it seems like...
7500080	7501460	By the way, do you like Fallout?
7501460	7502460	I haven't played it yet.
7502460	7505920	I avoided it, because people compared it to Elder Scrolls games.
7505920	7507440	It's basically Elder Scrolls with guns.
7507440	7508440	Which might be better.
7508440	7511200	Now, I do like Fallout more than Oblivion.
7511200	7513240	There's less people that really have wanted to do a fifth one.
7513240	7516400	It just seems like no one ever talks about Oblivion, so Bethesda doesn't see it selling
7516400	7517400	that good.
7517400	7519200	No, I think you might be wrong, buddy.
7519200	7521200	I think it did sell very well.
7521200	7525960	I just think those games take years and years to develop.
7525960	7528080	There was a rumor about an MMO based on Oblivion.
7528080	7529880	Yeah, that came out in court documents.
7529880	7534000	Anyway, that's why I think it's not happening for a while and I was just wondering how much
7534000	7535000	you wanted the fifth one.
7535000	7536000	I want it very badly.
7536000	7537000	Oh, and one last thing.
7537000	7540240	I signed up for the O.L. Army in the big battle at all games, and I think we need a battle
7540240	7541240	cry.
7541240	7543120	A battle hymn or song.
7543120	7544120	And a slogan.
7544120	7547000	Now, a slogan would be like, Fight for Ferity Justice.
7547000	7549500	A battle cry could be like, For the Ferret.
7549500	7550640	Those are just examples.
7550640	7552120	I'm not sure what to do for the song.
7552120	7554160	Well, time for me to be hitting the old dusty trail.
7554160	7555880	I hope we get more people for the battle.
7555880	7559280	I'll be serving a tour of duty for O.L.R. and Battlefield Bad Company 2.
7559280	7560280	Thank God.
7560280	7562560	I'm glad somebody's representing us in that, because I don't own that game.
7562560	7563560	Thank God.
7563560	7566240	Hats off to you, and I hope more people sign up for the Battlefield Bad Company 2 thing
7566240	7567240	on the 26th.
7567240	7568240	I don't know.
7568240	7570000	Do we have a battle cry that we could have?
7570000	7571280	We need to think about that.
7571280	7573000	Chatters, I put that to you, too.
7573000	7576480	What should the battle cry be for the O.L. Army in the big battle?
7576480	7580520	And please remember, guys, for the Horde, please remember, guys, remember the number
7580520	7583600	one rule of the O.L. Army when you do participate in this event.
7583600	7585520	Don't be a dick.
7585520	7588560	We like all these guys that are participating in it, so don't be a dick.
7588560	7589880	It's just a fun thing.
7589880	7590880	It's a fun, stupid thing.
7590880	7591880	It's like the Olympics.
7591880	7596080	It promotes peace and harmony and a little bit of spirited competition.
7596080	7597080	That's what it's all about.
7597080	7598880	It's the Olympics of video games.
7598880	7600840	But only all games is invited.
7600840	7601840	Alright.
7601840	7603120	Let's see.
7603120	7607440	Oh, reject false icons is possibly a battle cry that's being suggested.
7607440	7608440	That's a good one.
7608440	7609440	I like that from SSJ100Matt.
7609440	7610440	Alright.
7610440	7611920	That was it for the mailbag.
7611920	7612920	Mailbag out.
7612920	7615240	Orangelaungerator.com if you would like to contribute more in the future.
7615240	7617200	For now, we're going to get a little bit angsty.
7617200	7618200	Grrarg.
7618200	7619200	Dark Sakura.
7619200	7620200	Um, F.U.
7620200	7621200	To not have your voice.
7621200	7622200	Loki.
7622200	7644400	Um, F.U. to people on eBay to demand more money after an auction closes.
7644400	7647400	That's not how eBay works, stupid.
7647400	7652520	F.U. to the fact that I'm getting sick the day before E3.
7652520	7653520	Dammit.
7653520	7655520	People at all?
7655520	7661680	F.U. to Roseville Golf Land for their crappy taking care of their beautiful Technica machine
7661680	7664480	and for their 16 year old employees that are gone.
7664480	7666320	Well, there's a lot of angst tonight.
7666320	7669280	I think you guys did a very good job with your angst tonight.
7669280	7672760	We are going to get back into some gaming news, but for some reason I forgot to put
7672760	7674660	on our little list of things we're going to do tonight.
7674660	7678400	The Twitter topics, we don't want to ignore Twitter.
7678400	7683480	So here we go, we're going to go to Twitter topics right now.
7683480	7688520	Are you tapping along on your microphone?
7688520	7690000	We gotta hear that.
7690000	7692160	No, that's okay.
7692160	7693520	It is a very catchy song.
7693520	7695720	I don't know why, but this song makes me think of Twitter.
7695720	7699160	It's kind of like tweet, tweet, tweet.
7699160	7700160	I don't know.
7700160	7702600	Alright, let's go to the Twitter topics here.
7702600	7707160	Again, twitter.com slash O.L.R. you guys need to follow us on there immediately.
7707160	7710200	Tigerclaw305, oh he always loves to send us stories.
7710200	7713400	Gears of War art director makes an unreal movie pitch.
7713400	7715720	I'd heard about this just before tonight's show.
7715720	7718680	Apparently the Mortal Kombat wasn't the only movie pitch to happen this week.
7718680	7722940	Jerry O'Flaherty, which is the art director for the original Gears of War, he apparently
7722940	7728800	has done a pitch for a film called Samurai, but I guess it's based off Unreal and you
7728800	7733880	can actually look at a little clip right here, which there's one on the internet.
7733880	7738480	You know this is all artsy, it's kind of got that comic book-y look like 300 had a little
7738480	7739480	bit.
7739480	7741440	That could be cool.
7741440	7746400	I don't know though, haven't movies based on video games like really not done well?
7746400	7750560	Like Prince of Persia did not do as well as they thought, huh?
7750560	7752600	That's kind of sad.
7752600	7756640	Ray Ayanami sent us a link here about Arcade Infinity closing down.
7756640	7761360	No, not before I can go play Technica, why is everybody against me?
7761360	7765880	This is apparently, well I don't think it's happened yet, but this is an extensive story
7765880	7770360	that's coming from a website shoryuking.com that I guess is talking about the possibility
7770360	7772680	about Arcade Infinity closing down.
7772680	7773680	I don't know what's going on.
7773680	7779680	Just another week and then I don't care, I guess I'm heartless.
7779680	7783000	Yeah apparently you say no one wants to come to the arcades, I've lost 40% of my customers
7783000	7787360	in revenue and it's due to the home console releases of games.
7787360	7790320	Every month in Japan, 20 arcades close down.
7790320	7793280	Right now Japan doesn't have any good games to release, Japan still has a lot of games
7793280	7794280	to develop.
7794280	7798120	Interesting, but it doesn't say anything about whether for sure this arcade is shutting down
7798120	7799120	or not.
7799120	7802440	That's the part that's kind of like getting me here, but I guess, I don't know, it kind
7802440	7806920	of said here near the end, I can't read this whole story, it's like a feature here, but
7806920	7811800	they do intend to keep the arcade open strictly for the same reason he goes to work, the people.
7811800	7813560	He knows most of the people out there are like a friend.
7813560	7816400	The arcade to me is a business, but the people out there are now my friends.
7816400	7818640	I get excited for the games that are played.
7818640	7821240	So he doesn't say it's closing yet.
7821240	7826720	That mentality closed all of the arcades back in Wichita.
7826720	7827720	It was kind of sad.
7827720	7831400	I hope they don't actually close, that would be sad.
7831400	7835720	Let's see, TigerClaw sent us another link, I'll let him have two tweets tonight because
7835720	7836720	I'm nice.
7836720	7840560	Capcom will add Playboy advertising in Dead Rising 2 apparently is one of the big things.
7840560	7844480	Yes, there are magazines and actual magazine pictures on the wall and then actual magazines
7844480	7846200	you can pick up that are Playboy.
7846200	7852160	But this whole inserting product placement or what have you in video games is kind of
7852160	7855560	starting to become more and more of a trend, yet another way to make money off of games
7855560	7856840	besides the $10 thing.
7856840	7862760	We saw the Alan Wake this morning had the sink for the cars.
7862760	7866760	I don't know exactly what it's called beyond sink, but that was in there.
7866760	7870800	So now the Playboy bunny will show it up in the game along with some sexy ladies on the
7870800	7871800	cover of the magazines.
7871800	7872800	There you go.
7872800	7873800	She's not wearing a bra.
7873800	7874800	You know that, Miklata?
7874800	7875800	She has no bra on.
7875800	7876800	I have bad eyes, I can't tell.
7876800	7877960	Well, I was just letting you know.
7877960	7878960	Pretty glad about that.
7878960	7881000	She's gonna have saggy boobs when she's old.
7881000	7885440	Because she's not wearing a bra?
7885440	7887080	That's why women wear a bra.
7887080	7892220	Well, we don't want to know her when she's old, we just want to know her now.
7892220	7898440	Ray Ayanami wants to send us this story about Death Smiles, apparently is getting a US localization.
7898440	7900480	It's gonna be coming out later this June by Axis.
7900480	7906140	It was originally developed by CAVE, they did Don Donpachi, Espagluta, and all these
7906140	7907140	fun games.
7907140	7909080	Yeah, there's gonna be a localization.
7909080	7911440	The game is in English, hooray, Death Smiles.
7911440	7916840	It's coming out in a limited edition set with a faceplate and soundtrack.
7916840	7918280	Nice.
7918280	7921720	Alright, that's gonna do it for Twitter Topics tonight.
7921720	7924600	Again, twitter.com slash olr if you want to send us some tweets.
7924600	7929440	Show us your tweets a little bit, like the ladies in the Playboy magazine like to do.
7929440	7931600	Alright, let's get back into some news.
7931600	7932600	Loki.
7932600	7935600	Those would be teats, though, that they're showing.
7935600	7936600	Yeah.
7936600	7937600	Sorry.
7937600	7946960	Anyways, so there was a trademark lawsuit filed against EA Sports Active by website
7946960	7947960	active.com.
7947960	7956280	Apparently they think that they're famous and that, you know, that apparently people
7956280	7959320	might be confused that it's actually something from active.com.
7959320	7968060	Honestly, before this lawsuit, I did not know there was an active.com, so eh.
7968060	7972160	So we'll have to see what happens or what that's gonna do with EA Sports Active 2, which
7972160	7974080	will be out this fall.
7974080	7977360	I don't know.
7977360	7982040	That sounds stupid.
7982040	7983040	More lawsuits.
7983040	7984040	This is America.
7984040	7985040	God bless America.
7985040	7986520	Active.com wants some money.
7986520	7988040	Sorry I was a little bit of dead air there.
7988040	7990520	I was looking at Space Poncho tweets on Twitter.
7990520	7993760	Because apparently somebody actually made a Twitter account called Space Poncho now.
7993760	7994760	How long did that take?
7994760	7995760	Like five seconds.
7995760	7998280	A++ to whatever All Games Listener did that.
7998280	8000400	If it wasn't All Games Listener, it might have been somebody, I don't know.
8000400	8002920	Some other people are having fun with that little title now, too.
8002920	8004600	Alright, uh, oh boy.
8004600	8007640	This game, I saw this actually originally, I don't know, no they didn't post earlier
8007640	8010920	this week, but it also hit Destructoid.
8010920	8015940	It's apparently a game called Hey Baby, and I'm not talking about the No Doubt song, no,
8015940	8021840	this is a game called Hey Baby, where you play a woman who gets aggressively basically
8021840	8023580	catcalled by men.
8023580	8028000	They will say, hey baby, nice ass, or hey, I wanna fuck you, or whatever they're gonna
8028000	8029000	say.
8029000	8034800	And in this game, you take your aggressions out on these men by killing them.
8034800	8036640	And then when you kill them, they turn into tombstones.
8036640	8038280	That sounds like fun.
8038280	8043080	It's um, it looked pretty awful, I gotta say, actually, from the little trailer I saw.
8043080	8047160	I think the comment I posted on Oh No They Didn't when I saw the little graphics, I was
8047160	8050800	like, I think Hexen in 1996 had better graphics than this game.
8050800	8053640	There's actually a little trailer here we can actually look at here, there's a thing
8053640	8056440	on Twitter here.
8056440	8061040	It's payback time, boys.
8061040	8063720	Graphics are terrible.
8063720	8073760	I wanna see if we can get some of the, uh, I know you want it.
8073760	8076840	One of those guys said God bless you, and you're gonna shoot him?
8076840	8079280	That was a nice thing to say, that wasn't even, maybe you're only supposed to shoot
8079280	8080280	the bad people.
8080280	8084560	Some women are dopes, not all, just some, but like somebody saying God bless you, that's
8084560	8085600	not hitting on you.
8085600	8089640	You're probably ugly if you think that's the case, okay?
8089640	8096160	And then you shoot them and they turn into tombstones.
8096160	8100960	And the tombstones say such awesome things as I love you, and you should leave your man
8100960	8103320	and come with me, and wow you're so beautiful.
8103320	8104320	This game looks stupid.
8104320	8108320	And yep, she shot the guy and said God bless you.
8108320	8110840	Here's a flamethrower and stuff.
8110840	8114760	Don't play this game, this looks stupid.
8114760	8120200	Like I'm all for like woman power and stuff, but play Metroid.
8120200	8124800	It sounded like it would be fun for just a little waste of time as a flash game, but
8124800	8133880	that looked really dumb.
8133880	8134880	That's funny.
8134880	8136520	What, the game?
8136520	8137520	Yeah.
8137520	8138520	It just looks terrible.
8138520	8139520	It is terrible.
8139520	8145040	I mean I get it, it's a nice concept for a game, it's funny, but it's just executed
8145040	8146040	terribly.
8146040	8150840	Alright, we're going to get into another part of the show here that, gosh, we have
8150840	8157280	not done this in a very, very, very, very, very long time.
8157280	8162120	But I'm excited tonight, we're going to bring back the Orange Lounge Radio Match Game.
8162120	8177360	Yes, that's right, video game match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8177360	8180320	By the way, some breaking news, and I'm not going to play the theme, but apparently the
8180320	8184200	space ponchos just lit up green.

8435160	8442800	super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive
8442800	8450880	video to MTV, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they

8467600	8473640	their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive video to MTV, this is because

8511920	8515920	is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive
8515920	8520800	video to MTV, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they
8520800	8526240	will be showing, XLink, what is your answer? Space ponchos. Space ponchos they will be
8526240	8531400	showing, what a surprise that that answer came up, alright, Zeba says, they don't want
8531400	8537320	people finding out about all the games they will be showing, what a serious answer, which
8537320	8543360	means she's not gonna win, it's like the poor person on the show that gets booed, no don't
8543360	8548000	boo, it's a good answer, if it was a real game show, alright, that's alright, you never
8548000	8553200	know, you never know, maybe Dark Sakura's like I'm sick, I don't wanna write funny answers
8553200	8558120	tonight, Dark Sakura, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the
8558120	8562840	watermelon smashing, watermelon smashing they will be showing, unfortunately that is not
8562840	8568800	a match with space poncho, Loki, they don't want people to find out about all the, survey
8568800	8576240	says, space ponchos, space ponchos, ding ding ding ding ding ding ding, Ryan gets a match,
8576240	8582800	congratulations, Ryan it's one, Zeba, none, that's okay Zeba, there's four questions tonight,
8582800	8587680	you have a chance, Zeba just sent me a cry, emote icon, don't cry, it was a good answer,
8587680	8592200	just, good thing there's no money on the line, alright, Miklotov, you wanna go next or you
8592200	8595680	want me to go next, I don't care, why don't you go next, this is because they don't want
8595680	8601560	people to find out about all the, Wii ports, Wii ports they will be showing, is that a
8601560	8611800	match with games, judges, half point, I give a half point too, half point, I actually think
8611800	8617040	ports are games so I say games, alright I'm outvoted, a half point for Zeba on that one
8617040	8624760	and judges rules are final, this isn't real like TV, alright, this has become my answer,
8624760	8629920	this is because they don't want people to find out about all the, bukkake covered space
8629920	8634280	ponchos they will be showing, oh, there you go, that's the surprise, that's why they have
8634280	8639600	to wear the splash zone there, is that a match with space ponchos though, he didn't say bukkake
8639600	8643880	covered and I think that part is important, could be half point, cause the other half's
8643880	8647680	bukkake, I don't know, what do you guys think, a half point for X-Link for bukkake covered
8647680	8653800	space ponchos, he does say space ponchos though, what they're covered with we don't know, alright,
8653800	8659060	alright, so a half point, a half point for X-Link, so it's one and a half to a half,
8659060	8663960	there you go, there it is, question number one, right there, how about question number
8663960	8668800	two, you feeling good so far, X-Link you have a one point lead, I'm always feeling good,
8668800	8675300	what are you talking about, and we made your opponent cry tonight, that's, I always make
8675300	8682160	my opponents cry, so that's nothing, alright, be nice, alright, here we go, question number
8682160	8692240	two, did you hear, you guys are supposed to go what, let's try it again, did you hear,
8692240	8698320	the Mortal Kombat movie franchise might be coming back if one director gets his way,
8698320	8704720	the reboot might be pretty cool, but the cast of Orange Lounge Radio really hopes that the
8704720	8725040	director doesn't forget to have, blank, in the movie, ding, ding, ding, dark soccer
8725040	8732960	ding, she meeked, she meeked, that was like a beaker type thing there, alright, alright,

8786080	8794760	to have, Cher playing Sindel, the chick with the grey hair, Cher, ok, can you imagine Cher,
8794760	8799240	I could with her voice, she could sing, and it would be like that, that whole little thing,

9189720	9197480	my money on Xbox, X link, thought long and hard about this answer, and I'm going to say,
9197480	9203880	bukkake covered space poncho for the win, bukkake covered space poncho, I see what you're
9203880	9208720	trying to do, let's see if it works, bet my money on Xbox, bukkake covered space poncho,

9229520	9237560	alright, loki, the Xbox, you know ironically enough, one of the original answers that dark
9237560	9244160	sakura usually uses, actually fits pretty well with this, so the Xbox propel, I almost
9244160	9251300	had that, the Xbox propel, good answer, but not a match, Mikoltov, the Xbox motion plus
9251300	9256960	plus, the Xbox motion plus plus, I think I see what you're doing there, but not a match,

9266520	9274600	what the hell are they doing, what the freestyle and pose, this photo, it's of space poncho
9274600	9282060	fest, it's these people that look like they possibly could be cavemen or something, looking
9282060	9288080	at this giant screen, there's no goats are there, no, oops, I don't know why but that
9288080	9295560	music seems oddly appropriate all of a sudden, that's some strange stuff, alright, anyhow,
9295560	9299920	that's going to do it for match game tonight, the final score is zeba, you got a half point,
9299920	9305360	Ryan, xlink, you got two and a half points, xlink is our winner, yay, xlinks, good job,

9335800	9343760	xlink, yay, yay, he's plugging apathy, that's actually funny, I was just looking at threadless
9343760	9348440	and there's a shirt on that says apathy, our country's leading cause of whatever, why don't
9348440	9354520	you plug orange lounge, or plug space ponchos, why don't you do that, there you go, space
9354520	9361720	ponchos, there you go, goodnight, night, alright, congratulations to xlink, our winner tonight,
9361720	9365400	our completely apathetic, I did mention the prize up front, right, so he had like 30 minutes
9365400	9369640	to think about that while that game went on way too long, alright, how many listeners
9369640	9373920	did we lose during match game tonight, just out of curiosity, oh we gained some, oh, we
9373920	9379300	might have to do the match game every week, alright, they just wanted to hear space poncho
9379300	9382920	said over and over again, they did, the people that download the podcast tomorrow, it's not
9382920	9387000	gonna be funny anymore after tonight, but now we're gonna milk it up for all it's worth,
9387000	9391840	a couple more stories for you guys, then we open up the skype line to everybody, everybody's
9391840	9394800	gonna get to call in on the skype line, but not before we have just a couple more stories
9394800	9402880	for you tonight, Loki's gonna start it off here, space ponchos, space ponchos, shut up,
9402880	9411880	uh, yeah, so, let's see, uh, it's kind of funny, they actually, what was the reading
9411880	9418080	here, power gig, another game, you know, which before the whole rock band 3 announcement
9418080	9422520	of what exactly they're gonna have there, sounded pretty cool and unique, but it will
9422520	9428480	also be out this fall, their guitar of course is actually gonna be an electric guitar, a
9428480	9432620	real electric guitar, that also will have fret buttons on as well, the real difference
9432620	9436880	between that and say, the rock band guitar is that you can plug this directly into an
9436880	9441880	amp and actually play an electric guitar, whereas the rock band one, you know, you can
9441880	9447960	plug it into a midi controller and then play it, um, some of the artists announced for
9447960	9456800	the game, they have Dave Matthews Band, Kid Rock, Eric Clapton, and um, doesn't say any
9456800	9462160	other songs, but apparently, it's kinda cool they say, we think power gig is a much needed
9462160	9467040	and much welcome game because unlike any others before it, it puts a real guitar into the
9467040	9473120	hands of aspiring musicians, and we hope it inspires our fans and others to start playing,
9473120	9475760	even when they're not playing the game.
9475760	9480400	Ironically though, while their guitar may be really cool, they released pics and information
9480400	9487720	about their drum set, which looks like shit, and the reason why it's pretty crappy is because
9487720	9493980	you actually don't hit the drums, you hit above the drums, it's like playing air drums
9493980	9501360	I guess, which is kinda strange, I don't know.
9501360	9504880	I'm just excited we're actually gonna get to see this game at E3 this year, you know,
9504880	9507200	because when they went to PAX, they didn't show anything.
9507200	9512720	Um, yeah, I wish we'd see Scratch there too, that'd be kinda cool.
9512720	9516400	They might have it for the iPad or iPhone or whatever they were saying.
9516400	9519640	I'd rather see the PC version, because that's one that's actually gonna be kinda similar
9519640	9521200	to the console release.
9521200	9522200	Yeah.
9522200	9527280	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're gonna open up the Skype line at Orange
9527280	9534680	Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR, uh, it's not open yet, guys, haha, I like
9534680	9537600	how the calls start coming in like instantly, I'm sorry, I'm just looking at all the Space
9537600	9541400	Poncho tweets, it's doing pretty good, it's doing pretty good.
9541400	9543680	It's catching on a little more than President Cat, I think.
9543680	9547680	It might actually, if the World Cup wasn't happening right now, it might trend, we would
9547680	9548680	see.
9548680	9554320	Uh, let's see here, moving on to one more story, guys, about a new game from the guy
9554320	9561280	who was wearing a Space Poncho earlier, Itagaki, that's right, oh god, Tomonobu Itagaki, he's
9561280	9566280	the guy who did Dead of Alive, Dead of Alive, Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden, and he's kinda
9566280	9571280	known for, well, tit engines, basically, you know, if you play Dead or Alive, tit and blood
9571280	9572720	engines, that's right, good times.
9572720	9578360	Well, he left Temco, and now he's at THQ, and they debuted the game that he is working
9578360	9580720	on, it's called Devil's Third.
9580720	9585520	It's from his new studio, Valhalla Games, and it's violence, violence, violence and
9585520	9586520	gore.
9586520	9592200	It's gonna be on the Playstation 3, and the Xbox 360, and there is a little trailer that's
9592200	9597600	kinda surfing around the internet right now, so we're gonna take a look here, at the trailer
9597600	9598600	here for Devil's Third.
9598600	9602840	I just wanna see all the blood and violence in this.
9602840	9611040	Aw, there's, oh wow, that shotgun made all the limbs explode.
9611040	9612480	Yeah, there were chunks coming off.
9612480	9615840	No more, that was kinda gross, but funny.
9615840	9619440	See this is, this is cartoony, ahahaha, I like that, the machine gun, that's the guy
9619440	9623640	that was flying up the building.
9623640	9629000	It doesn't look like a bad game, I'm kinda surprised.
9629000	9634000	See there's a girl in this, this is what the Hey Baby game should have been.
9634000	9636000	There it is.
9636000	9638440	The music kinda makes it more fun to watch too.
9638440	9643200	Oh, cars exploding, Loki, you could do some great YouTubes to this I bet.
9643200	9644200	Devil's Third, looks like fun.
9644200	9645800	I bet we'll get to play it.
9645800	9646800	Yay!
9646800	9649640	And then decide it's not fun.
9649640	9650640	We'll see what happens.
9650640	9655360	Alright, uh, that's gonna do it for our regular stories tonight, but we might have some last
9655360	9659360	minute stories, I don't know, let's see if any last minute stories are on deck.
9659360	9663400	And then we'll get to the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9663400	9665480	Loki, you have some quick stories here?
9665480	9667200	Uh, nothing pulled up unfortunately.
9667200	9669400	Well, luckily for you, we have a call coming in.
9669400	9671400	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9671400	9673640	Hi, this is Ray Iannami.
9673640	9676200	Hi, Ray Iannami, what's on your mind tonight?
9676200	9681400	Um, about the deskmoss we had posted earlier, I'm pretty sure I already posted something
9681400	9682400	like that months ago.
9682400	9685640	The point I wanted to make was the dialogue that they localized.
9685640	9687600	Like, did you see the screenshots?
9687600	9688600	Yes, it was all in English.
9688600	9690880	I thought I mentioned, like, hey, they made it all in English.
9690880	9694720	Yeah, I thought it was this, I thought some of it looked familiar, but maybe, I thought
9694720	9698320	maybe the release date was new and some of that, some new information, if you will.
9698320	9705920	Well, if you noticed, like, do you see, like, how all the dialogue was, like, localized?
9705920	9706920	Mhm.
9706920	9712560	Yeah, apparently someone posted this on Shmups forum, and people pretty much exploded over
9712560	9715160	it, just because of how badly it was done.
9715160	9720040	I mean, it kinda reminded me of, like, how someone would go about, someone in a forecast
9720040	9724680	would go about dubbing a forecast anime.
9724680	9725680	Are you gonna get this game, though?
9725680	9727560	Are you gonna get the deathsmiles game when it comes out?
9727560	9728560	Does it look like something-
9728560	9732200	Um, I've already pre-ordered it, I mean, yeah, the dialogue, the shitty dialogue doesn't
9732200	9738080	stop the game from being any less playable, but it just worries, but I have a slight feeling
9738080	9743180	that some people might remember the game for the dialogue and not for the gameplay, but
9743180	9747680	then again, it's a shmup, and no one really plays the game for a shmup for the dialogue,
9747680	9749200	so I guess I'm not all that worried.
9749200	9752520	You play for the bullets everywhere.
9752520	9756040	Let me ask you another question, Ray, and I'm gonna ask this of all the callers tonight,
9756040	9757760	so if you're gonna call in to the show, be prepared.
9757760	9760760	What are you most looking forward to about E3 next week?
9760760	9763800	Um, besides Space Pontius, I don't really know.
9763800	9768360	I don't really follow all the, like, big name stuff.
9768360	9770360	I'm more of a niche gamer.
9770360	9772480	Alright, well, fair enough.
9772480	9775500	E3, I guess, isn't a big deal for everybody.
9775500	9776500	That's alright.
9776500	9777960	Every gamer gets a voice, even when you're wrong.
9777960	9778960	No, I'm kidding.
9778960	9779960	Alright.
9779960	9781800	Well, Ray, we're gonna let you go, so we can get some more calls, but do you have any last
9781800	9782800	thoughts for our listeners?
9782800	9785800	Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, uh-
9785800	9790200	I got into playing Escalade 2 this week, um, I guess I'll just, I don't know, talk about
9790200	9792200	it on another call.
9792200	9793200	Oh, okay.
9793200	9794880	Well, what'd you think?
9794880	9797240	Give us a quick summary of what you thought.
9797240	9798240	It's pretty fun.
9798240	9804920	Um, it's kinda like a most bullet hell shooter, except being slowed down bullets, and among,
9804920	9808320	like, other things.
9808320	9810340	Did you like it, or pass?
9810340	9814800	It's pretty fun, but I keep, like, not- I keep holding back from playing the game just
9814800	9817440	because of how difficult it is to play for score.
9817440	9818440	Alright.
9818440	9822040	Well, uh, keep playing, and let us know, uh, what you think, alright?
9822040	9823040	Alright.
9823040	9824040	Alright, take care, buddy!
9824040	9825040	Alright, see ya.
9825040	9826040	Later!
9826040	9827720	Alright, we're gonna get some more calls here on the Skype line.
9827720	9831440	877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
9831440	9832440	Let's get to another call.
9832440	9834440	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9834440	9835440	Hello.
9835440	9836440	Hola!
9836440	9841600	Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, quien es?
9841600	9844960	Uh-oh, we have a bad call.
9844960	9849880	Remember, call Echo 1-2-3 before you call Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good way to test
9849880	9851840	your connection to make sure it works.
9851840	9854920	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9854920	9857600	This is Scarzo, what's up, Rob?
9857600	9859500	What is up, Scarzo?
9859500	9860500	What is on your mind, buddy?
9860500	9865400	Uh, I just wanna tell Mikol Tov, you know, I jumped in my GMC DeLorean, I thought I saw
9865400	9870720	him on Friday night, I totally forgot to post that on the chat line, um, I saw somebody
9870720	9876280	who was actually kinda bummed out about DJ Max Technica being down on Friday night, and
9876280	9877760	you guys were there on Saturday, right?
9877760	9878760	It's not just me, I guess.
9878760	9879760	It's not just you, Mikol Tov.
9879760	9882760	I could imagine that a lot of people would be upset about that, because it's supposed
9882760	9885000	to be a really, really good game.
9885000	9889480	Let me tell you, Mikol Tov, straight up, dude, because Roseville Golf Land, um, Rob, go ahead
9889480	9894560	and fill in your input, uh, Roseville Golf Land is crap, by the way, here's the problem.
9894560	9899480	They had a problem with the hard drive, this was when I started playing back in December,
9899480	9902760	they were getting a lot of blue screen to death, the game was lagging, it was slowing
9902760	9906560	down, it was just horrible, so the problem was, they would just have to restart it, and
9906560	9907800	I can just keep going.
9907800	9913520	Uh, it wasn't until, like, maybe a month ago, where it just blue-screened, they would restart
9913520	9916800	it because they know I'm the regular over there and I will always play during Arcade
9916800	9921280	Mania, and on, like, Friday, Saturday nights after I get off work, uh, the problem was,
9921280	9926640	it runs on Windows XP, by the way, it starts up and it says that the program cannot start.
9926640	9930720	For some reason, it was shut down incorrectly, also known as blue screen to death, and so
9930720	9935760	for over a month now, I've been just kind of sitting here chilling, but, uh, I needed
9935760	9938760	Mikol Tov's opinion, is it worth it to get DJ Maxx?
9938760	9941200	I mean, in comparison to BeatMania, is it pretty good?
9941200	9945320	Oh, I like it about a thousand million times better.
9945320	9948960	You have to remember Mikol Tov is totally biased and partial towards Korean music.
9948960	9949960	This is very true.
9949960	9953360	In fact, I think he tried, did you try to get it in DDR here in America?
9953360	9954360	Korean stuff?
9954360	9955360	Yeah.
9955360	9956360	No, no, I just thought- I thought you tried to do that.
9956360	9957360	That'd be cool.
9957360	9958360	No, no, I might have.
9958360	9959360	I don't really know.
9959360	9962840	Weren't there, like, the- I don't know how much I'm allowed to talk about, but don't-
9962840	9966240	let's assume, let's, let's hypothesize you got to actually suggest songs for inclusion
9966240	9967240	in the game.
9967240	9968960	Wouldn't you have written down a bunch of Korean songs?
9968960	9975280	I think I might have, but I was more always leaning towards, um, 90s music, because who
9975280	9980160	wouldn't want to do, like, you know, uh, Rhythm is a Dancer, but then it all ended up in Hardest
9980160	9986240	Party and I was depressed, but anyway, um, yes, DJ Maxx, way more fun, in my opinion,
9986240	9987240	within Beatmania.
9987240	9993520	Um, it gives me a reason to play my PSP and, um, I don't know, it just- it's a really fun
9993520	9994520	game.
9994520	9998200	Like, when, uh, Black Square came out, um, I got it home, um, because I sent it to work
9998200	10002240	and I swear I played that for, like, eight hours straight because it was just that much
10002240	10003240	fun.
10003240	10007680	Yeah, you've got Mission Mode, you've got, you know, really good songs and, you know,
10007680	10008680	it's worth it.
10008680	10013040	Um, I can't really throw my support too much behind the American version.
10013040	10019680	It was decent, um, and it had a few good songs, but I would, if you're, like, new to the game,
10019680	10024320	I would go with, like, you know, the classic Y slash Black Square bundle, if that's still
10024320	10025720	around, because those are two really good games.
10025720	10028880	Oh, definitely, and I mean, I'm trying to, you see, I'm broke and I work two jobs, so,
10028880	10030400	you know, I'm just making ends meet.
10030400	10034560	I'm trying to get a PSP and, I mean, hey, don't give me a rest or anything, I'm going
10034560	10037760	to try to mod it because the only version that we, you know, that I can get my hands
10037760	10040360	on as of right now is DJ Maxx Fever.
10040360	10044720	Yeah, and it's not a terrible game, it's just, there were a lot of problems with it that
10044720	10050400	they have not released an update to fix, but, you know, you get some of the best songs from,
10050400	10052720	uh, the first two games in it.
10052720	10053720	Definitely.
10053720	10057200	If you can get it for, like, I don't know, ten or fifteen bucks, that's worth it.
10057200	10060560	Um, I wouldn't pay more than, more than fifteen for it, though.
10060560	10064560	Okay, and did you hear about the, uh, Technica 2 soundtrack being leaked?
10064560	10066960	Because I can't find that yet and that's a tough one.
10066960	10069800	The, um, just the limited edition version?
10069800	10074640	Yeah, um, it's on a Korean website because I'm friends with some of the Sunnyvale Golf
10074640	10078640	Land players because that's where most of the, like, top score, the elitist players
10078640	10082320	are, and one of them got their hands on it and they were telling me about it and I was
10082320	10084240	just like, man, I gotta look for that.
10084240	10090360	I bought through, um, a website, uh, the limited edition Technica soundtrack that came with,
10090360	10095480	you know, the card and the keychain and the soundtrack, um, and I actually have it with
10095480	10099760	me too because it's a good card holder and I knew I'd get my hands on some of the Technica
10099760	10100760	1 cards.
10100760	10103440	Um, the soundtrack is crap, though.
10103440	10104440	So I'm not really looking...
10104440	10105440	You know, I was hearing mixed reviews.
10105440	10106440	Don't get me wrong.
10106440	10107440	I mean, I like the music.
10107440	10108960	It's something new for my ears.
10108960	10109960	Don't get me wrong.
10109960	10111480	So, you know, I want to give it a shot.
10111480	10115240	Technica has way better music, Technica 1, and at least when Technica 2, if it's not
10115240	10119240	already out for real, um, it will have most of that Technica 1 music on it.
10119240	10120240	Um, I got...
10120240	10121240	Oh, yeah, definitely.
10121240	10122240	Definitely.
10122240	10124040	I want to jump in here because I do have to wrap up and get to other calls, but I like
10124040	10125040	this caller.
10125040	10126640	He's got energy, he's local, he knows what he's talking about.
10126640	10129880	I know, and I can talk about DJ Max, and that's something I can do for hours.
10129880	10131920	I know, and so if I don't jump in here, that would be good.
10131920	10134320	Hey, Rob, hey, Rob, this is your boy, Jay Hugo on Twitter, by the way.
10134320	10135320	Not trying to put a plug.
10135320	10136320	Don't follow me.
10136320	10137320	I'm just saying.
10137320	10138320	This is your boy, Jay Hugo, okay?
10138320	10141640	All right, no, I appreciate it, and one of these days if I actually go to Roseville Golf
10141640	10142640	Lane again, although you missed it.
10142640	10143640	I was there Saturday.
10143640	10144640	We'll meet up.
10144640	10145640	I know.
10145640	10146640	What was I going to say?
10146640	10147640	Oh, I'm asking all the callers this.
10147640	10149440	What are you looking forward to at E3 this year?
10149440	10152280	Man, you know, okay, like, I'm not a big fan.
10152280	10154080	I don't play fighters, but I love watching it.
10154080	10156800	It feels like a competitive movie, Marvel versus Capcom.
10156800	10158440	I got a bunch of friends.
10158440	10160000	That looks pretty cool, in my opinion.
10160000	10163480	I mean, I would go... If I could go to E3 with you, I'd be there for the bukkake, but
10163480	10165440	you know, that's another radio show.
10165440	10166440	We can't be saying that.
10166440	10167440	You know what I'm saying?
10167440	10168440	Wait a minute.
10168440	10169440	Wait a minute.
10169440	10170440	Wait a minute.
10170440	10171440	Are you sure you want that to be put in the podcast?
10171440	10172440	I don't know.
10172440	10173440	I'm just saying.
10173440	10174440	That's permanent.
10174440	10175440	I'm just saying.
10175440	10176440	I mean, you could go bleep me out.
10176440	10177440	I'm just saying.
10177440	10178440	No, no, it's funny.
10178440	10179440	It's funny.
10179440	10180440	All right.
10180440	10181440	I like him.
10181440	10182440	He's funny.
10182440	10183440	We're going to have to get him on the show at some point.
10183440	10184440	All right.
10184440	10185440	And the Technica machine will be working.
10185440	10186440	We can always have a good time.
10186440	10187440	Good times.
10187440	10188440	Oh, yeah.
10188440	10189440	One quick thing.
10189440	10190440	Platinum Crew is great.
10190440	10193560	Technica 2, dual mixing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
10193560	10194560	The interface is a little weird.
10194560	10196760	Oh, I love that interface for two.
10196760	10197760	It looks so nice.
10197760	10198760	It is.
10198760	10199760	It's beautiful.
10199760	10203160	But not as hot as the classical eye singer, the female, when she had long hair, though.
10203160	10204160	Hoorah.
10204160	10205160	That's what I got to say.
10205160	10207600	Coming soon is going to be a new podcast, apparently.
10207600	10209680	Ironically, a music game podcast with these two.
10209680	10211320	They're just going to talk for hours about it.
10211320	10212320	I could do it.
10212320	10213320	All right.
10213320	10214320	We're going to let you go.
10214320	10215320	All right.
10215320	10216320	I'll let your boy.
10216320	10217320	I'll let your boy.
10217320	10218320	I'll let you guys go.
10218320	10219320	Have a good night.
10219320	10220320	You know, first time calling.
10220320	10221320	Thank you so much for everything.
10221320	10222320	And man, I've been missing out on the last eight years.
10222320	10223320	But I'm here now.
10223320	10224320	So let's keep it going, guys.
10224320	10225320	All right?
10225320	10226320	Glad to have you, buddy.
10226320	10227320	You have a good one.
10227320	10228320	He's a good guy.
10228320	10229320	He always pimps our show on the Twitter and stuff.
10229320	10230320	Don't think I don't notice that stuff.
10230320	10231320	I really appreciate that.
10231320	10232320	He's very enthusiastic about the show.
10232320	10233880	Let's take another call from him.
10233880	10234880	Really appreciate it.
10234880	10237080	No, we got to get to more other calls.
10237080	10243440	But first, guys, I know you think I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's E3, I can't control
10243440	10253120	when there is breaking news.
10253120	10254120	Tom Brokaw here.
10254120	10255120	Boo-kake.
10255120	10256120	Anyway, no.
10256120	10261120	What I really wanted to point out was that it has been revealed that there is a Star
10261120	10262120	Wars game.
10262120	10263120	We mentioned this before.
10263120	10266760	There is a Star Wars game for Kinect, and it has been announced it will feature controller
10266760	10269520	free lightsaber fighting.
10269520	10270520	You got...
10270520	10271520	I know.
10271520	10272520	How does that work?
10272520	10273520	I don't know.
10273520	10274520	But here's the thing.
10274520	10275520	You've got to love Microsoft.
10275520	10276520	You've got to love them.
10276520	10277520	Well, you can hate them.
10277520	10278960	But you've got to love them.
10278960	10283280	They don't even make it a secret that they just rip off other people's ideas and make
10283280	10284280	it better.
10284280	10288120	What has everybody wanted on the Wii since the first day people put their hands on that
10288120	10289120	controller?
10289120	10290120	Lightsaber battles.
10290120	10291120	But is it going to be better?
10291120	10292580	Because you won't have anything in your hands.
10292580	10293580	It's like the videos for...
10293580	10297600	It isn't at all, you're supposed to be able to hold up an object, and that's your new
10297600	10298600	thing.
10298600	10299600	Okay, I'm going to roll up a piece of paper.
10299600	10300600	There you go.
10300600	10301600	For a toilet paper roll.
10301600	10302600	You have a toilet paper roll that you just...
10302600	10306440	I'm just going to find a random object, like, I don't know, like a pie roller.
10306440	10312520	If you go to Kotaku right now, their top story there is showing the space ponchos, and they
10312520	10314760	have video of space ponchos.
10314760	10315760	Oh, good God.
10315760	10316760	All right.
10316760	10317760	God, our Skype line is blowing up tonight.
10317760	10318760	Sorry, guys.
10318760	10319760	We will get back to you guys in a minute.
10319760	10320760	See that top point right there?
10320760	10321760	All right.
10321760	10322760	This coming courtesy from Kotaku.com.
10322760	10324080	I'm going to close all these people calling.
10324080	10325080	Stop calling for a minute.
10325080	10326080	Leave me alone.
10326080	10327080	All right.
10327080	10328080	Scroll down.
10328080	10329080	Hold on.
10329080	10330080	I'm going to go into Do Not Disturb for a minute.
10330080	10332580	We will open up the Skype line in just a moment, I super duper promise, okay?
10332580	10333800	But this is very important.
10333800	10335320	We need to see space ponchos.
10335320	10338200	Leave us alone.
10338200	10339200	What is that?
10339200	10340200	They are plant people.
10340200	10341200	This is creepy.
10341200	10342200	They're plant people.
10342200	10345320	What the fuck does this have to do with video games?
10345320	10347720	This is why we have to go tomorrow.
10347720	10357440	They're just, they're plant people moving around.
10357440	10358440	They're-
10358440	10362960	Well, see, they're getting the idea across that you don't need a controller to play.
10362960	10366120	You just need a really silly headdress and some robes.
10366120	10367880	I thought there was going to be video of the space ponchos.
10367880	10368880	I thought so too.
10368880	10369880	Not the plant people.
10369880	10370880	Fuck the plant people.
10370880	10374440	There's, where's, where's bald dude in the space poncho?
10374440	10375440	That's what I want.
10375440	10378800	It's got to be really hot with all those people wearing the silvery space ponchos.
10378800	10381800	I wonder if you can go on YouTube.
10381800	10383520	I love commenters.
10383520	10386240	I was wondering if YouTube has some space poncho.
10386240	10388200	No, they'd be on Twitter.
10388200	10395880	I know our boy Bobby Black Wolf is monitoring the Twitters right now, and he will let us
10395880	10398480	know the incident of space poncho because he's trying to get the space poncho thing
10398480	10399480	to trend.
10399480	10400480	Hey Rob.
10400480	10401480	What?
10401480	10402480	Space poncho five.
10402480	10403480	Choo choo.
10403480	10407400	Uh, let's see, by the way, uh, comments from chat room here, Black Wolf is apparently also
10407400	10411800	read it as an on rails light rail, lightsaber game.
10411800	10413360	Weird.
10413360	10414360	I could be down with that.
10414360	10415360	We'll see.
10415360	10416720	I don't care about Star Wars.
10416720	10417720	It's whatever.
10417720	10418720	All right.
10418720	10419720	I'm opening up the Skype line again.
10419720	10420720	You can call.
10420720	10421720	It's open.
10421720	10422720	Sorry guys.
10422720	10423720	It's just, I had to stop and see the plant people.
10423720	10424720	Thanks.
10424720	10425720	Loki.
10425720	10426720	By the way, Loki starting a new blog, right?
10426720	10427720	Loki.
10427720	10428720	You want to plug that real quick?
10428720	10429720	Cause you literally started.
10429720	10430720	We talked about it.
10430720	10435040	We talked about it last week, um, and there was some hiccups because as I mentioned in
10435040	10441600	my FUs, douchebag that I bought the PC from, um, wanted more money after the auction closed.
10441600	10444080	He's like, Oh, I'm not selling it for this kind of money.
10444080	10447260	I'm like, well you should have put a reserve price on it then.
10447260	10452080	And so he refunded my money and I gave him negative feedback after a strict, uh, scolding.
10452080	10455760	But I did find another PC for the same price, just six cents more.
10455760	10459540	So a project under $100 is back on.
10459540	10466780	It's basically a kind of a, as I put it, an experiment in frugality and engineering, um,
10466780	10471860	that's basically gonna, uh, be tasked in building a working MAME machine.
10471860	10478160	This is a PC in an arcade cabinet with arcade controls under $100.
10478160	10480160	That's easy.
10480160	10481700	You would think it would be.
10481700	10482700	It's not.
10482700	10483700	We've done it.
10483700	10485080	Well, I know, but here's the thing though.
10485080	10490080	There, there are specific, um, instructions regarding this.
10490080	10494640	Granted, you could find an old PC and old stuff and do all that, but I'm assuming that
10494640	10498480	somebody doesn't have that and they have to buy everything.
10498480	10502400	Buying everything for under $100 a lot harder than it sounds.
10502400	10504760	So donations don't count towards your under $100.
10504760	10506400	Donations do not count.
10506400	10511640	Everything must be purchased except of course, you know, construction materials like tape
10511640	10514280	or you know, glue and that kind of stuff.
10514280	10515440	I'm assuming that you have that.
10515440	10518480	I was gonna say in my backyard, I have an empty arcade cabinet.
10518480	10520760	We have a ton of controllers and buttons.
10520760	10521760	Yes.
10521760	10522760	Yes.
10522760	10523760	I'm basically, it's worst case scenario.
10523760	10528120	I mean, if, if you wanted to and you didn't have anything, could you do it under $100?
10528120	10529380	And the answer is yes.
10529380	10530440	I gotta get back to the phones.
10530440	10531760	They are blowing up you guys.
10531760	10532760	Did you give out the URL?
10532760	10533760	Oh yes.
10533760	10538460	Uh, the URL is under $100 at 100 is, you know, the number.
10538460	10542880	Under $100 mame.blogspot.com will be a link on orange lines later.
10542880	10547480	By the way, guys, we need a space poncho page on Wikipedia, like right now and get it created
10547480	10550000	and then link it to all of us before our wiki.
10550000	10551000	Yeah.
10551000	10552000	No.
10552000	10555040	I think official Wikipedia should have space poncho both.
10555040	10556040	Let's get to another call.
10556040	10558280	We've got to try and blow these cause our, our phone lines are blowing up tonight.
10558280	10559280	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
10559280	10560280	Who's this?
10560280	10561280	Hey, this is Ingo.
10561280	10562280	Hey, Ingo.
10562280	10563280	What's on your mind?
10563280	10564280	I'm glad we can hear you this time.
10564280	10565280	What's on your mind?
10565280	10566280	I want a space poncho.
10566280	10567280	Me too.
10567280	10569360	Sadly, I have to work tomorrow.
10569360	10570360	Boohoo.
10570360	10571360	All right.
10571360	10572360	What if you're sick?
10572360	10573360	What's on your mind?
10573360	10576360	What the hell is going on with these Microsoft pictures?
10576360	10578520	Like cavemen that are emo.
10578520	10581440	Wait, cavemen that are emo, Microsoft?
10581440	10583440	Are you talking about the pictures from the event or what?
10583440	10587040	Yeah, it's the one where they're like, it's like on a hill and they're like, there's the
10587040	10589840	big old logo there and there's a TV or something.
10589840	10592480	Cirque du Soleil is like that modern art thing.
10592480	10593480	You know what?
10593480	10597120	Wouldn't you be emo if you didn't have fire?
10597120	10601240	I would be emo if my space poncho wasn't changing colors like I, you know, it's supposed to.
10601240	10604320	Imagine if the space ponchos glowed blue.
10604320	10607360	You're just giving me more reason for, to make you call in sick tomorrow.
10607360	10608840	No, calling in sick tomorrow.
10608840	10609840	All right.
10609840	10611680	Uh, what was I, what else was I going to say?
10611680	10614440	Oh, what do you, what do you most want to see at E3, Ingo?
10614440	10617280	Uh, Medal of Honor and Power Gig.
10617280	10622520	Uh, do you know any rumors about these different series and where they're going?
10622520	10626680	I think Medal of Honor is going to blow Modern Warfare 2 out of the water.
10626680	10628280	Ooh, them's fighting words.
10628280	10630020	Why is that?
10630020	10638720	Because it's the, the, I don't know, because it looks awesome and the guy looks like ZZ Top.
10638720	10640640	Well there's a good reason right there.
10640640	10641640	Awesome.
10641640	10647160	Well, um, you know, I hope you enjoy E3 and all the news that's coming out of it and I
10647160	10648160	get some stuff.
10648160	10649740	Is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?
10649740	10650740	I have an announcement.
10650740	10651740	Yes.
10651740	10654080	I officially quit Infinity Ward.
10654080	10655080	Oh my gosh.
10655080	10656920	Wait, did you work for Infinity Ward?
10656920	10657920	Yeah.
10657920	10658920	You did?
10658920	10659920	Yeah.
10659920	10660920	I didn't know that.
10660920	10661920	Wow.
10661920	10663920	I didn't know we had listeners of Infinity Ward listening to this show.
10663920	10664920	Wow.
10664920	10665920	Okay.
10665920	10669360	Now I work for a different developer that I don't want to talk about.
10669360	10673280	Why did you, can we, can we ask you why you quit Infinity Ward or is it one of those like
10673280	10675400	it ought to be obvious, Rob?
10675400	10676840	Uh, kind of.
10676840	10679880	Appreciative contract on Activision's side.
10679880	10680880	Ooh.
10680880	10681880	Okay.
10681880	10682880	All right.
10682880	10683880	How about that?
10683880	10684880	I had no idea.
10684880	10685880	Congratulations.
10685880	10686880	All right.
10686880	10688480	Well, uh, good luck to you on your new endeavors, whatever they may be.
10688480	10689480	Will we see you at E3?
10689480	10690840	Are you going to be at E3 or no?
10690840	10691840	Cause they don't like programmers.
10691840	10692840	Probably.
10692840	10694060	Uh, I'll be there.
10694060	10695600	You just probably won't see me.
10695600	10697600	Oh, Oh, well, okay then.
10697600	10698600	All right.
10698600	10700560	Well say hello if you do happen to see us.
10700560	10701560	All right.
10701560	10702560	Okay.
10702560	10703560	Bye.
10703560	10704560	Have a good E3.
10704560	10705560	You too.
10705560	10706560	All right.
10706560	10707560	Who knew?
10707560	10708720	How often were we covering those Infinity Ward stories?
10708720	10711140	We had somebody on this listening who worked on it.
10711140	10714220	You never know.
10714220	10716120	You know, I really hate to do this to you.
10716120	10720760	I really hate to do it, but at the same time, it's E3 guys.
10720760	10724760	What now?
10724760	10737400	Apparently SingStar has a new game that is being revealed at E3.
10737400	10744680	It is called SingStar Dance, and it's being revealed at Sony's press conference on Tuesday
10744680	10745680	morning.
10745680	10750120	It's supposedly compatible with the PS3 move controller, SingStar Dance.
10750120	10751960	News is leaking out about that tonight.
10751960	10755800	If you're going to hold the microphone and the move controllers in your hand, how's that
10755800	10756800	going to work?
10756800	10757800	I don't think you actually sing.
10757800	10758800	I think it's just a dance game.
10758800	10759800	Call it a dance.
10759800	10762480	I don't have a SingStar title.
10762480	10763640	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10763640	10764640	Who's this?
10764640	10768000	This is the Space Poncho List SSG100 man.
10768000	10770640	Hello SSG100 Matt, our Space Poncho loving friend.
10770640	10771640	What's on your mind buddy?
10771640	10772640	Not much.
10772640	10777800	Um, I quickly want to get you guys thoughts on, you know, I have a feeling that this E3
10777800	10781480	they're going to be ramming the 3D gaming down our throats.
10781480	10782480	Yes.
10782480	10783920	What do you guys think?
10783920	10788680	I think it can go suck my dick because I am not a big fan of E3 or E3.
10788680	10789680	Wow.
10789680	10790680	Whoops.
10790680	10791680	Uh oh.
10791680	10792800	That's going to get cut.
10792800	10794360	I'm a big fan of E3.
10794360	10795360	I love them.
10795360	10796360	It's 3D.
10796360	10800340	I am not a big fan of it because it makes me sick when it gets to that level.
10800340	10804240	Like watching Avatar in the theater for like two hours and all that.
10804240	10809760	I think all these games are just too much.
10809760	10813600	I hate it if I have to buy a new TV and glasses for it.
10813600	10820160	However I will probably support the 3DS because it's all built in and I won't have a problem
10820160	10821160	with that.
10821160	10822160	But I don't want to buy updates to games.
10822160	10823160	I don't want to buy special glasses.
10823160	10825620	I don't want a $2,000 TV.
10825620	10826620	I'm extremely...
10826620	10828960	I do want a $2,000 TV but I don't want it for that reason.
10828960	10833280	I'm extremely apprehensive about the 3DS but I will check it out and give it a fair shot
10833280	10834520	and may I be wrong.
10834520	10836760	I will come out on the show Tuesday night.
10836760	10837760	You'll know.
10837760	10841400	I will post the little Rob Roberts and pals at E3 and if I'm wrong I will say I was wrong.
10841400	10842400	This thing is awesome.
10842400	10843400	They have a Pokemon game.
10843400	10844400	I'm sold.
10844400	10848040	You know if you want to blame anyone for you know this whole 3D thing you got to blame
10848040	10853640	the TV makers because everyone now is buying... everyone pretty much has an HDTV.
10853640	10858480	I don't know the exact numbers household wise but you know they need to... they want to
10858480	10862680	try to crank out you know new hardware, new stuff for people to buy.
10862680	10866360	The HDTVs and 3DTVs are completely different.
10866360	10867360	I mean...
10867360	10872000	Yeah I know but you know everyone pretty much has a 3... an HDTV now so you know they're
10872000	10876160	trying to get people to get the new upgrade, the new tech.
10876160	10877160	What do you think?
10877160	10881280	I'm turning this on you SSJ100mau, what do you think of 3D games?
10881280	10886480	I think it could work but I don't think that now is the proper time.
10886480	10887480	Now is too early.
10887480	10888840	This is all happening too fast.
10888840	10892280	The movies are one thing and then the rest is... it's too much.
10892280	10893280	Too much.
10893280	10896120	You know when our economy is a little more stable, when we're... when we're able to be
10896120	10904920	a little more frugal to go out and spend these $3,000 TVs with $150 glasses I'll look into
10904920	10905920	it.
10905920	10909920	But you know right now very little TV is 3D now.
10909920	10915720	I mean I know ESPN has jumped on it, I know different sports are doing it but you know
10915720	10917400	it's just too early.
10917400	10918400	So.
10918400	10924200	Let me ask you this real quick, what thing at E3 are you looking forward to the most?
10924200	10928760	I want Microsoft to give us more you know games for live.
10928760	10931400	You know like one versus a hundred.
10931400	10932400	Where are those games?
10932400	10934080	Yeah whatever happened to that?
10934080	10935080	Was it just like a simple experiment?
10935080	10936080	You know what I want to see?
10936080	10937280	I want to see them do match game.
10937280	10939840	I would love match game, that would be amazing.
10939840	10940840	Match with thousands of people.
10940840	10947920	What I'd like to do is just hook up a couple of Xbox 360 Slims and revive Charles Nelson
10947920	10948920	Reilly.
10948920	10949920	Oh my god that would be wonderful.
10949920	10950920	It would be great.
10950920	10951920	All right.
10951920	10955880	I just want to let you go so we can get at least one more call here on this long running
10955880	10956880	show tonight.
10956880	10957880	But thanks so much for your call.
10957880	10958880	Yep.
10958880	10959880	Have a good one buddy.
10959880	10960880	Yep.
10960880	10962960	All right I guess the Kinect event is over, that's what Black Wolf says.
10962960	10965600	I don't know what happened but there you go.
10965600	10967080	People probably just walked out.
10967080	10969040	I don't think they walked out.
10969040	10970800	Did it blow people's minds?
10970800	10971800	That's what I want to know.
10971800	10975040	Was it a mind blowing experience?
10975040	10978840	Were your minds blown?
10978840	10979840	Last call of the night.
10979840	10982000	Hi you're on Orange Llamas Radio, who's this?
10982000	10985880	You know I'd rather walk around and wear a space poncho throughout Manhattan than play
10985880	10988120	Final Fantasy VIII again.
10988120	10989480	Amen to that.
10989480	10990480	I would.
10990480	10991480	Boom.
10991480	10992480	Oh my gosh.
10992480	10993480	I'd do both.
10993480	10994480	Whatever.
10994480	10997080	All right what is on your mind tonight Rama?
10997080	10999680	I'll make this quick because I know you guys are running late.
10999680	11006560	Well a few weeks back I finally got my hands on Beatles Rock Band and guitar hero Van Halen.
11006560	11011440	Okay, so first tell us about Beatles Rock Band.
11011440	11018400	I've only played a couple of tracks and honestly, my personal opinion, I would not have paid
11018400	11019400	$59.
11019400	11021800	I would have paid $39 or $49 for it.
11021800	11026280	Luckily I got it on clearance for $9.99 at Target.
11026280	11030480	Hmm, okay, and wait $9.99 for Beatles?
11030480	11033160	Yeah, select stores at the time were clearing them out.
11033160	11035120	I'm walking in, just checking what they had.
11035120	11037640	I saw Van Halen for $15 on clearance.
11037640	11042320	I looked over and saw Beatles for $10 so I grabbed that too.
11042320	11044920	Awesome.
11044920	11049560	Well I mean, and you like the game or it's kind of one of those, well I'm really happy
11049560	11051240	I didn't pay $60 for this.
11051240	11056360	I'm really glad I didn't pay $60 for either game because I was really hyped for guitar
11056360	11057360	hero Van Halen.
11057360	11058360	I really was.
11058360	11063440	So I started playing through it and I'm like, I'm not so hyped anymore.
11063440	11068960	And the one thing that pissed me off is that I'm halfway through the game with the drums.
11068960	11072560	I figured, let me finish up the other half of the game on guitar.
11072560	11080080	No, I have to go through everything all over again with the guitar and I said, screw this.
11080080	11085120	Alright, what about Van Halen, guitar hero?
11085120	11089360	That's the one I was talking about.
11089360	11093760	I'm still hoping that one of my favorite songs is in the game, but I don't think it is, but
11093760	11095960	I just enjoy the music.
11095960	11098800	That's the main reason why I got it in the first place.
11098800	11103320	And honestly, I think Activision really need to step their game up because we just got
11103320	11109600	Green Day Rock Band and well, I'm really liking that a lot more and I think that's how you
11109600	11113760	really need to do the expansion titles more like that instead of like having practically
11113760	11120640	all the songs unlocked and all you're doing is unlocking like venues and so forth.
11120640	11128800	Start out with like six or seven songs and start unlocking all the songs as you play.
11128800	11131360	Did you play the Green Day Rock Band by chance yet?
11131360	11133560	Yeah, we have it here.
11133560	11135160	My roommate picked it up last week.
11135160	11136160	I'm trying to line up an interview.
11136160	11139720	I've seen out of it, I'm trying to like line up an interview for like the last part of
11139720	11140720	the show here.
11140720	11142680	So I'm like half listening and half doing this.
11142680	11145520	Sorry I'm the only one engaging our caller right now.
11145520	11153080	And also before this is over, I want to throw in my two cents on this whole project $10
11153080	11154080	bullshit.
11154080	11155080	Yeah, please do.
11155080	11157480	I think we just got his 10 cents.
11157480	11158640	It's bullshit.
11158640	11159640	I'm sorry.
11159640	11166120	You mean to tell me after I spent 50 bucks on live, I got to spend another $10 for on
11166120	11167840	line gaming?
11167840	11168840	If you buy used.
11168840	11169840	Used?
11169840	11170840	I don't care.
11170840	11177640	And a lot of these, and remember like GameStop now is deducting $10 from the price of their
11177640	11178640	games.
11178640	11182280	So in a sense, it's not really going to be any more money.
11182280	11186560	But yeah, but then the new game buyers get screwed because now their games are worth
11186560	11187560	way less.
11187560	11189920	Yes, the trade ins will be worth less.
11189920	11190920	Don't.
11190920	11192140	They pay for it either way.
11192140	11196480	And they're saying that this money is going to go pay for the servers and the people that
11196480	11197480	admin it.
11197480	11198480	That's bullshit.
11198480	11199480	No, I know.
11199480	11202880	That money is going to upper management to fatten their pockets because I'm on that echelon
11202880	11206800	of like code monkeys and tech guys.
11206800	11210480	We are the underappreciated folk in this world.
11210480	11215000	Of course it was a bullshit corporate speak, but we knew that.
11215000	11220200	Well what are you looking forward to at E3 next week as I've been asking everybody tonight?
11220200	11225920	I'm actually looking forward to hearing all of what Microsoft has to say, what Nintendo
11225920	11233240	has to say, and I'm really curious about the supposed price cut of the $199 by Sony.
11233240	11237320	I'm really curious about that because I heard that twice and I'm like, that's too good to
11237320	11242360	be true.
11242360	11244360	Anything else you want to say about E3?
11244360	11246840	No, that's pretty much it.
11246840	11247840	That's it.
11247840	11248840	Alright.
11248840	11252920	I'm going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show here and get out and all
11252920	11256760	that fun stuff, but thank you so much for your call and sorry I was only like half listening.
11256760	11258240	There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes here.
11258240	11259240	My bad.
11259240	11260240	That's okay.
11260240	11261240	We love you too.
11261240	11262240	Just wait until you come out to Brooklyn.
11262240	11263240	Yeah, goody goody.
11263240	11264240	Alright.
11264240	11266400	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skyline.
11266400	11267400	Sorry guys.
11267400	11270960	We're getting hammered tonight, but so many of you didn't get through and I'm sorry, but
11270960	11274360	please feel free to send us some emails.
11274360	11280800	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to get through a little, in a different way
11280800	11282800	I guess you could say.
11282800	11283800	Alright.
11283800	11287800	Let's go ahead and go around and kind of start to wrap up the show and get everybody's final
11287800	11288800	thoughts.
11288800	11289800	It's going to be an awesome E3.
11289800	11290800	I'm very excited.
11290800	11294280	I really hope I'm not sick or I'm going to be fucking mad, but we'll bring you again
11294280	11298060	special shows Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday as soon as we can get them posted.
11298060	11300800	If you don't see anything Tuesday night, don't freak out.
11300800	11301800	Something just went wrong.
11301800	11302800	We're trying to get an internet connection.
11302800	11305680	Or we went to play DJ Maxx.
11305680	11306680	Perhaps.
11306680	11307680	So final thoughts.
11307680	11308680	Are we ready?
11308680	11309680	My water's boiling.
11309680	11310680	Well, alright.
11310680	11311680	Well, bye Dark Sakura.
11311680	11312680	At least it's not breaking.
11312680	11313680	Alright.
11313680	11316920	Um, Loki, your final thought tonight?
11316920	11322320	My final thought is this week will be fun to watch all the, uh, different press conferences.
11322320	11325920	My final thought is I'm excited to go home and take some NyQuil.
11325920	11326920	Yay.
11326920	11329520	Here's one last thing I want to think about here.
11329520	11330520	Yes.
11330520	11331520	Um, Ponder maybe.
11331520	11332520	Yes.
11332520	11336720	I want to face ponchos for our avatars on Xbox Live.
11336720	11339360	That would be amazing.
11339360	11340760	That would absolutely be amazing.
11340760	11343040	Um, Miklotov, thank you for being here.
11343040	11344040	Thank you.
11344040	11345840	You came out all the way from Kansas just to be on the show, I'm sure.
11345840	11347480	Yeah, that was exactly my reason.
11347480	11348480	Exactly.
11348480	11349480	Sure.
11349480	11350480	Nothing to do with E3 or Technica.
11350480	11351480	Mostly Technica.
11351480	11353040	Uh, so, uh, do you have any final thoughts?
11353040	11358520	Um, my final thought is I hope that leaked floor plans for E3 are true and I get to play
11358520	11364320	Pokémon Black and White and see Dragon Age 2 because those are probably the games that
11364320	11365920	will be my highlights of the show.
11365920	11366920	Alright.
11366920	11367920	Well, we'll see.
11367920	11370960	We're just a few days away from, uh, the show floor being open.
11370960	11371960	It's less than 48 hours.
11371960	11372960	Yeah.
11372960	11373960	Excited.
11373960	11374960	Alright.
11374960	11377960	We'll see you, uh, in a couple days with the Rob Robertson Pals special from E3 and then
11377960	11379840	we will all be here in studio next week.
11379840	11383640	Loki Dark Soccer and myself, Loki Dark Soccer will be scouring up and down the internet,
11383640	11387720	uh, throughout the week to, uh, get us some good news to talk about, uh, and it'll be
11387720	11390400	a fun show, the E3 wrap up show next Sunday.
11390400	11392560	So we will see you next week with more of Orange Launch Radio.
11392560	11395120	In the meantime, thank you guys for listening to our show.
11395120	11398840	Thank you for subscribing to our podcasts or listening live, however you're doing it.
11398840	11403200	Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show.
11403200	11406960	Help us spread the word because we're not a big, uh, we can't afford a booth at E3.
11406960	11408060	Let's just put it that way.
11408060	11410200	Make sure that, uh, you help spread the word.
11410200	11413280	That is how, um, we get more people exposed to Orange Launch Radio.
11413280	11416280	Can you afford a taco stand outside E3?
11416280	11417520	You heard the caller earlier.
11417520	11419200	He wished he'd known about this eight years ago.
11419200	11420520	So all you gotta do, tell your friend.
11420520	11421720	Alright, that's it guys.
11421720	11422720	Good night.
11422720	11423760	Have a wonderful E3.
