13920	22589	Tonight, June 13th, 2010, the E3 News Barrage begins and we connect with our listeners to get all your feedback on the early news.
31926	34147	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers I'm not sick anymore
59635	63838	But you're going to sound it on the radio, though, because you have your voice thing going on.
64219	70503	The problem is I had a viral infection and it coughed my throat, well, bloody.
71204	71604	Gross.
73386	77248	So I'm actually not supposed to use my voice much until the 21st.
78556	81699	DarkSakura's role in tonight's show will be scaled back just a little bit.
81759	82780	Just a little.
83060	86142	But she'll still be here to provide her always insightful commentary.
86583	86943	Of course.
87103	88945	I've got some snark.
89925	92588	Being sick makes a person a little extra snarky, I find.
93208	94309	I am also a little sick.
94729	96351	Just now the E3 is coming up.
96571	102776	I have this gift, I don't know what you want to call it, where I tend to get sick at big gaming conventions.
102836	105638	It happened at PAX East earlier this year and now it's happening again for E3.
106539	106979	Hooray.
107620	112023	Well, also joining us tonight, say hello to the well and healthy, at least for now, Tech Master Loki.
112443	114925	I am perfectly fine, except in my head.
115405	116265	I am sick in the head.
116566	121709	But that's why we love you here on Orange Lounge Radio, Loki, which we're coming up on, if you can believe it, our eighth episode.
122009	124731	Say hello to the one and only Miklatov is here tonight
149949	151550	Video Game Company to a Video Game Store
169258	171480	And for those who don't know, you used to work for... Konami.
171580	174001	Yes, and can you say what you did at Konami, or was that a secret?
174061	184188	Yeah, I did DDR, and I made the steps, and with, you know, the other people on the team, and I did text stuff, and yeah, that's what I did there.
184629	185750	Oh, I got drunk.
188431	189152	Because it was fun.
189502	189782	DarkSakura,
201524	202065	Probably.
202485	202765	Yeah.
203005	203546	Absolutely.
204066	204507	So what happened?
204607	205547	Are you allowed to talk about what happened?
205567	206148	I don't know.
206168	207129	Maybe Supernova.
207229	208149	Supernova was really good.
208250	209510	Are you allowed to talk about what happened?
209571	210912	Why you no longer at Konami?
211112	211952	Oh, yeah.
212273	217797	They just moved and I didn't want to move because I didn't have a permanent quote unquote position.
217937	221860	So I wasn't going to get paid to move down to where they moved their offices to.
221980	224962	So I decided time to leave.
225723	227684	And so you went back to where your family is, correct?
227705	227925	Yes.
228485	229686	Which is in the Midwest.
229926	230126	Yeah.
230246	230467	All right.
231127	231487	I agree.
231787	232287	I'm just kidding.
232668	234128	All right, but things are good for you in Kansas.
234148	234868	Kansas treating you well?
235028	235789	Yeah, good enough.
236149	237229	Well, welcome back to the show.
237309	239610	I'm sure you haven't listened since the last time you've been on.
239750	241011	Like for the past three weeks.
241071	241711	Oh, that's right.
241731	243251	You've been commenting in chat and stuff.
243432	243652	Yeah.
243712	247273	The show's kind of different now than it was when you were first coming onto the show, huh?
247293	253375	Yeah, it's not so much about the music games anymore, but there aren't very many great music games anymore, so it's okay.
253835	254275	Makes sense.
254716	258617	For our new listeners, real quick, can you kind of define, what did Orange Lounge Radio use?
258757	259357	That's pretty much it.
259377	259637	You got it.
274083	289409	E3 is coming up and we're going to talk a lot about E3 tonight with Miklatov And speaking of which, we have big, big news coming out of the big cities tonight We're going to start off the show a little differently tonight We have an Orange Lounge Radio special report
299008	301711	That's right, we do have some big breaking news.
301831	310058	It does appear that Scarlett Johansson has won the Tony for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play for A View from the Bridge.
310098	313762	Congratulations to Scarlett Johansson, you hot bitch.
313902	317245	We all, okay, E3, yeah, no, there's some huge news coming out of E3.
317765	322850	Obviously tonight is Microsoft's big reveal of Project Natal.
323210	324832	Not necessarily the press conference.
324992	338660	and yes, it's not their press conference but it's their Cirque du Soleil as imagined by Cirque du Soleil or as one of my friends calls it Cirque du Sogay as the Project Natal is being reinvented or reimagined or whatever they're doing.
338680	340241	I like how Patton Oswalt describes it.
340321	341242	What does he describe it as?
343423	344423	That's pretty much what it is.
360050	360731	Dance Central Dance Central
388829	392092	and USA Today is calling it a So You Think You Can Dance experience home.
392132	395255	Although it's not for sure if the brand name actually plays into it.
395315	396175	Probably not.
396516	402861	But if you want to tie in directly to last week's show, there's your Timberland Cascada game and all those things we were talking about.
402901	404422	Did I say Timberland like a tree?
404502	409046	Timberland and Cascada and all those things we were talking about last week.
409066	410067	That's got to be it.
410107	410588	That's it.
410788	412709	Timber... Whatever.
413550	414051	And the Vomitarium
430965	460385	The Vomitarium, that might be in Kinect Adventures River Raft Time Trial, Obstacle Course up to four players on the raft playing as a duo, you and a partner lean one way or another to steer also a game called Joyride which was originally announced a little while ago got pulled from Xbox.com and then came back, it's a racing game that's the one where you're going to hold the imaginary steering wheel and drive back and forth Connectimals, you train and play 20 different virtual cats
460965	462826	including a lion, a cheetah, and a tiger.
463546	466327	It's kind of like Pokecats, but with Kinect.
466527	467528	I don't know what else to call that.
467908	478232	And lastly, and this is pretty big, Star Wars characters and Disney favorites will be featured in separate new games being developed at Microsoft in conjunction with LucasArts and Disney.
478633	482574	So, you know that whole Wii lightsaber game y'all been wanting for years and years?
482654	483155	Guess what?
483295	484255	Microsoft announced this
484295	486037	And that's what you think of the name?
512855	513796	DarkSakura.com
532219	533781	I played with K'nex when I was a kid.
535843	537385	I played K'nex 4 when I was a kid.
539327	540608	Miklatov, what do you think of K'nex?
540748	541289	It's dumb.
541910	542831	Why do you say it's dumb?
542951	543431	Because.
544813	545634	We know Natal.
546094	549118	That sounds kind of cool, futuristic, what they're kind of going for.
549538	549838	K'nex.
549858	549979	Really?
550879	551220	Really.
551440	557362	Yeah, but see, remember, we all love the revolution, and, you know... And the Wii is still a stupid name.
557542	559043	I'm not gonna say it's not.
559263	560243	Let's go to the chatters.
560343	563344	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com, after all... It's just a name!
563444	564745	It's the place where every gamer has a voice.
565305	569947	Uh, SJ100Matt, you know we said the same thing when they came out with the Nintendo Revolution before the Wii.
571503	578047	I'm glad that they're coming out with this wonderful system and they're totally mimicking everything that's on the Wii already.
578467	579327	Okay, let's see.
579467	581028	We've got a game that's like Wii Sports.
581088	583790	We've got a game that's probably going to be like Wii Play.
584610	586631	And we've got a game that's just like Just Dance.
587052	593015	Oh, and we've got a game with Disney characters and Star Wars characters that will probably be very similar to what's already on the Wii, just with slightly better graphics.
593195	594956	Oh, and we have a racing game with a fake wheel.
596976	602179	I mean, really, are we going to have the same shit on this stupid console?
603139	607901	Am I really going to pay the mythical $150 for this thing?
609242	614244	Fool me once, Microsoft, I already bought your fucking camera, and it served me no purpose whatsoever.
614464	616345	Oh, but you did get to use your picture as an icon.
617286	618086	Or a gamer pic.
619767	620527	And Burnout.
620607	621347	The Burnout game.
621768	622088	Remember?
623448	623729	Oh, okay.
623749	632857	It took pictures of you when your car crashed, so you get pictures sent to strangers on the internet where it looks like you're taking a poop because you have these urgh faces.
634679	638022	Alright, more chat or comments, because boy, they're being eloquent tonight.
638522	649832	Bochikawa in our chatroom, chat.orangehawnsradio.com, by the way, if you want to join us here live on this Sunday night, as we tape at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
650132	654556	Bochikawa in our chatroom says, connect just won't connect to the consumer.
656656	659918	This is basically their grab for the Wii Market.
660439	667264	Problem is, people in the Wii Market have a Wii, and they're not going to buy another console to play the same fucking games.
669665	670406	I buy everything.
671006	672667	TigerClaw in our chat, you're special.
673048	677111	TigerClaw in our chat says one of the other games will probably be Connect the Dots.
678001	680822	BaconBit says the name doesn't matter as long as it's fun.
681662	685664	And BauerCTU says I'll call it shit, not connect.
686084	687024	How about ka-shit?
687164	689165	Can we compromise here, Bauer?
689325	690866	It'll be alright, but the problem...
692116	692616	Thanks for watching!
711226	712447	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
732904	749481	Let's see more stuff in chat I love this Salacious Pop in chat says When I hear and say Natal I think Xbox Motion Accessory But whenever I see Microsoft NATAL in print Or Microsoft Natal in print I think of ultrasounds, folic acid vitamins And diaper genies
752548	756191	TigerCloud says watch, they will have cheesy taglines like connect to the web.
756211	758813	They should have just called it the kinetic.
759614	761315	I mean, because that would have been kind of neat.
761936	765098	It would have at least sounded kind of fancy and stuff.
765218	771043	And I give them points, they're like one step above move, because move is just like, oh, what should we call this?
771063	772704	I don't know, it's a control you move around with.
772824	774105	Ah, move, good, done.
774486	775887	They didn't even think about a name.
776187	781991	Techness in our chat says they might as well have named it Connect 3D since 3D is the new marketing term and the tech that it's based on.
782572	785834	SSJ100Matt says the real question is do they announce an Eye of Judgment game?
785954	787215	If so, do we care to make a bet on it?
789197	790017	And let's see.
790318	792559	Lastly, where were we at?
792619	795802	Oh yes, SSJ100Matt says Connect starring Jodie Foster.
795942	797303	Spoiler alert, it's her father.
799958	801379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
823067	830552	Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into a little bit of the normal flow of our show, but we thought we'd interrupt there for the breaking Xbox news.
830913	833855	We will keep you posted if anything else breaks during the conference.
833875	836096	Or if we think of any other funny connect jokes.
836197	839219	Special events featuring Cirque de French Gay.
839699	841360	Star Trek Online, I Hit Commander, Finally
867031	871294	Yay, um, I made a friend in Scotland.
871514	871935	Did you?
872235	872535	Yes.
872835	874056	If it's not Scottish, it's crap.
875437	875778	Agreed.
876618	883544	Um, and, uh, I, uh, I've been playing Sims 3 like I'm doing right now.
883564	885745	During the show.
885765	886246	It's slow.
886506	886906	During the show.
886946	887927	Well, what else is new?
888027	889328	No, it's, I know, I know.
889508	892109	Those of you not playing Star Trek Online during the show and eating bandwidth.
892189	892550	True.
892750	894371	I turned off Steam for the show, Rob.
894611	895491	I'm very happy you did that.
895511	898013	I was enamored with watching everyone's Steam updates.
899093	900094	Oh yeah, I played some Portal.
902515	903896	Especially since I got it free.
905216	905777	Free is good.
906477	907177	Free is very good.
908598	909038	Alrighty.
909759	910639	Let's move on to Loki.
910659	913021	How was your gaming week, Loki?
913521	914902	Same old stuff again.
915502	916242	Grand Theft Auto.
916843	917203	Mainly
919606	927870	I've been playing just the regular deathmatch stuff, but we have been having some really serious connection problems thanks to our wonderful bandwidth at work.
928871	930852	Red Dead Redemption, more co-op than that.
930952	932873	I think I'm like level 20-something now, like 23.
934274	943338	And Earth Defense Force, we're most of the way through the Inferno difficulty, and it's major fun.
945880	946220	What else?
947240	947500	That's...
948721	949382	Pretty much it.
949582	959450	It's been mainly painting baby room and working on Grand Theft Auto 4 editing.
960030	962312	It's Imagine Babies in real life, basically.
962984	964425	Well, it's game related.
964725	965946	The room is New Super Mario.
965986	969668	Actually, and I don't know if the pictures are public or whatever, but they're really cute.
969748	972910	Like a lot of the stuff that you and the wife are doing are really cute.
973711	982776	Yeah, we got big old stuffed animals of Koopas and, you know, the star and the fire flower and stuff like that.
982816	990921	And then, of course, we have wall decals for the New Super Mario Brothers characters and the bricks and question blocks and all that fun stuff.
991317	992918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1019825	1024712	and it was the best one though and it made me sad and I hate the people at Roseville Golf Line because they're idiots.
1025093	1026535	I hope they listen and know that they're dumb.
1027446	1033691	I loved it too because when Miklatov was kind of getting off the plane and he met Alan, we went out to lunch when he first got here.
1033911	1037935	Because what's the first thing anyone wants to do when they come to California?
1037955	1038796	I was like, let's go eat.
1039036	1040277	And Miklatov wanted to go too?
1040497	1041037	In-N-Out.
1041097	1041378	All right.
1041438	1047623	So we went to In-N-Out and we were eating and Miklatov was like, I didn't come here for E3.
1047663	1049104	I came here to play DJ Max Technica.
1049164	1049605	It's true.
1049985	1054869	So when we went to Roseville Golf Line last night and I looked and the machine was broken, I couldn't help but laugh.
1055249	1056190	It was really funny.
1056290	1058552	It was a really depressing moment in my life.
1058592	1064198	I mean, sad, but... And then the people would not sell me Technica cards, which they had.
1064478	1066339	I had to go up there three times to get them.
1066760	1068421	Finally, the guy just said, okay.
1069182	1071444	And he's like, you know, these don't work because the machine doesn't work.
1071464	1075288	I'm like, I understand that, but I'm giving you money to give me these cards.
1076069	1077270	And they did.
1078170	1080653	I hate 16-year-olds that work at arcades.
1081673	1084435	Arcade Infinity is still open and couldn't you guys go there?
1085336	1086456	That's a backup plan.
1086476	1087377	Yes and yes.
1087777	1092600	I'm actually going to call them and be like so do you have a working Technica machine?
1092860	1094521	Because other places don't.
1094941	1095381	You should.
1095902	1098023	And there was also an idea we could go to Sunnyvale Golf Land.
1098043	1099664	We don't think we can make it work with the timing.
1099884	1101845	Because I have a family thing Saturday I have to go to.
1102429	1107733	and Sunnyville has Sirius too which would be fun to play but maybe Arcade Infinity might as well since they used to be up on that stuff.
1108053	1108433	Perhaps.
1108593	1109053	I don't know.
1110034	1110334	Alright.
1110454	1112516	Aren't they like almost closing now or something?
1112536	1114217	Aren't they like one of those save the arcades?
1114297	1116398	Yeah, yeah.
1116438	1116779	Sadly.
1117059	1120701	Sherzo in chat says Rob, I was there when he was there Friday night.
1120781	1122162	Miklatov was at RVGL.
1122282	1122763	I met him.
1123223	1126085	Well that's amazing because he was still in Kansas Friday night.
1127126	1128867	We both went on Saturday actually.
1128887	1129827	That's so cool.
1129907	1132269	Like it was me from the future but in the past.
1133570	1134751	Unless he's getting his days mixed up.
1134771	1138134	He could have been that guy because there was a guy playing Beatmania 2DX who was pretty good.
1139355	1140436	I met Miklasov too.
1140837	1141097	Hi.
1142598	1144680	It's a first in a couple years.
1146442	1147963	Anything else you played this week you want to mention?
1148363	1169294	um oh on the plane I was playing DJ Max because it's like the only game I play anymore and this old lady was sitting like two seats next to me away from me because we had an empty seat in the middle she kept watching me play it and it was really creepy because she was like really old like 60 or 70 and then she's talked to me I was like whatever I just want to play my game
1171328	1174390	But she enjoyed DJ Max kind of over your shoulder?
1174410	1177612	Or being a creepy stalkery, I don't know.
1177692	1178052	Old lady?
1178472	1179553	Yeah, that's what I said.
1179773	1180373	All right, there you go.
1180733	1181134	Creepy.
1181174	1183015	Did you have your first encounter with a cougar?
1185336	1186156	Come here, little boy.
1186176	1187057	I have some candy.
1187117	1188037	Oh, that is gross.
1189249	1190750	Alright, my gaming week.
1191090	1192752	Not quite as interesting as anyone else's.
1192852	1198716	Although I did go to Golfland with Miglatov last night and point laughed when the machine was down.
1198776	1199396	Although not really.
1199456	1200677	I actually thought that was kind of crap.
1200697	1201478	You did laugh though.
1201898	1205941	I did laugh, but it was one of those like, that fucking sucks laugh.
1206021	1206482	Like, you know.
1207622	1210424	But I played Beatmania, what is it they have there?
1210564	1211965	Distorted.
1212065	1212786	Was that 13, 14?
1213026	1213386	That's 13.
1213446	1213786	Whatever.
1214206	1215367	When the music stopped getting good.
1216288	1216728	Some teen.
1217048	1217629	Yeah, some teen.
1218309	1219850	But I played a bunch of old songs.
1220150	1223132	I can surprisingly still pass level 7 and 8 songs.
1223252	1224593	I beat Daisuke, I was all like, woo!
1225660	1227121	What happened to you playing Final Fantasy XIII?
1250715	1251335	DoctorStrangePork
1272324	1273945	It was a mouse with a long tongue.
1293042	1306128	Alright And that was pretty much my gaming week Not a lot of exciting stuff outside of that But BlackWolf in chat says Oink is awesome, you all stop making fun of Oink right now I love Oink It's Miklatov that is the hater
1307591	1308332	Haters to the left
1326912	1327452	Housekeeping First
1358559	1359259	E3 Overload
1379677	1382619	Rob Roberts and pals will bring you some specials to the feed.
1382859	1385081	And of course, Miklatov, one of my pals, will be there every night.
1385401	1390225	I'm hoping that Bobby Blackwolf and whatever other pals I find in LA will also be there.
1390265	1391966	So there'll be lots of feed updates this week.
1392026	1399211	So make sure you are subscribed to our feed in iTunes or whatever your favorite little podcatcher program is so you don't miss anything.
1399631	1401553	This is also very important during housekeeping.
1402114	1410622	I have a bad feeling this is going to get forgotten a little bit amongst all the E3 hype that's going on right now, but I do want to mention we talked about this a little bit last week, but it is official.
1411243	1415067	Orange Lounge Radio and our listenership will be participating in the All Games Big Battle.
1415447	1416008	BigBattle.com
1433828	1435769	I know one of them was Pinball.
1436089	1437470	Those are the recently announced ones.
1437510	1449554	Those were just announced a little earlier this week where you can actually play either Zen Pinball on the PS3 or the Pinball FX on the 360.
1450755	1452135	Those games will be a part of this.
1452495	1454856	Also, Soldner X2, there's competition for that.
1455416	1460078	And there is going to be a live competition on June 26th, Battlefield Bad Company 2.
1460398	1461379	All that information is at...
1462099	1470565	BigBattle.AllGames.com We will bring you a little more information on that this next week after E3 settles down a little bit.
1470605	1475188	The first competition I believe ends is the Soldner X21 and it ends on the 26th.
1475228	1476068	So we have a little time.
1476389	1479090	But if you want to get the jump on these competitions, go check it out.
1479130	1480091	Especially the pinball ones.
1480251	1482132	I know we have some listeners that are good at pinball.
1482373	1488997	There is no reason that Orange Lounge Radio should not destroy all of the other shows participating in at least pinball.
1489097	1490118	And pinball is two.
1490158	1490538	There's two.
1490638	1491959	There's pinball FX and pinball.
1492480	1494804	So we should have at least half these competitions right out the gate.
1494824	1497049	They got me excited there because I was reading this all of a sudden.
1497109	1499694	It said, for PS3s and pinballs, Earth Defense Force.
1499714	1501017	I'm like, ooh, Earth Defense Force!
1501519	1502320	I will win at that!
1502960	1503481	But no.
1504161	1505422	Unfortunately, it's not.
1505703	1509305	I am trying to get Derek to put Grand Theft Auto 4 as one of the games.
1510126	1510587	But we'll see.
1510687	1511527	It would be kind of tough.
1512048	1514330	And it has to be Episodes of Liberty City because that's a better game.
1514790	1515471	We'll see, we'll see.
1515911	1517752	Alright, we'll talk more about that next week.
1518673	1524298	Not to belittle the importance of the event, but just with E3 going on, I just think everybody's going to forget.
1524378	1530303	It's going to get kind of lost amongst all the E3 madness, but we will be kind of giving you regular updates on what's going on there.
1530704	1535979	Starting next week So again, sign up now, get the jump on everything Read all about it, bigbattle.allgames.com
1537434	1540275	Let's see what else is going on right now that I want to tell you guys about.
1540555	1543857	The anniversary show for Orange Lounge Radio is coming up in two weeks.
1544277	1545697	So next Sunday we will be live.
1545737	1546798	It's our post E3 show.
1547158	1554101	Then we will be here for the anniversary show of Orange Lounge Radio which will be on the 14 days from tonight.
1554121	1555021	So the 27th.
1555521	1557322	And then after that is July 4th.
1557402	1561323	We will not be live on July 4th due to the holiday.
1562304	1564845	People want to go set things on fire instead of sitting here on the radio.
1565965	1566705	Don't forget Geek Life
1592867	1595428	DarkSakura is going to start us off tonight with some gaming news.
1595468	1596149	What's up, DarkSakura?
1615990	1617170	Guitar Hero.
1618050	1618871	I mean, Rock Band 3.
1618911	1623512	The keytar is official for Rock Band 3.
1624212	1629953	It is going to be either something you can play as a horizontal keyboard or over the shoulder.
1630053	1633894	It has this little handle, very keytar-like.
1634694	1637135	It looks like a two-octave keyboard.
1637175	1639315	It looks very Keyboard Mania-like.
1639496	1640116	25 keys, I think.
1640296	1641116	Yeah, two-octave.
1641936	1643417	Yay, it's not a keytar.
1643537	1644998	Yay, yay, yay.
1645038	1648760	I mean, you could stand it upright and it could be a guitar, but it's an actual bona fide keyboard.
1648860	1649960	I love you, Harmonix.
1651981	1655063	So yeah, there's that and the hyper guitar.
1656103	1657044	Did you see that thing?
1658285	1659045	The hyper guitar.
1659125	1660866	Was that like the 120 button one?
1661006	1662627	The 120 fret with strings.
1662867	1664748	Well, now they want to teach you how to really play.
1665971	1667111	I kind of want it.
1667212	1667692	You know what?
1667812	1671893	I didn't care about any of it because keyboards and Bohemian Rhapsody.
1671953	1680956	And the cool thing is if you play in pro mode and you play the expert level and if you can memorize what you're doing, you will be able to play the actual real song.
1681116	1682077	That is the great thing about this.
1683197	1683377	Yes.
1684217	1691621	The only thing that I thought was a little weird was when you look at the video, the pro mode note chart kind of scrolls to the right and to the left.
1691661	1693261	You don't see it all on the screen at once.
1693421	1694682	I think that's actually kind of cool.
1694962	1697823	I think it's supposed to tell you when to move your hands around.
1698143	1701965	I think that's what the point is, but I'm a little apprehensive about it.
1702125	1707750	Well, it's limited screen space, basically, because you can't have 25 rows on there at one time.
1708290	1713274	So what they do is, as the song shifts octaves or whatever, it will scroll over.
1714535	1716277	Which is fine by me, it looks pretty awesome.
1716357	1720180	I was wondering how they'd be able to pull it off, and it looks like you can do it.
1720300	1726565	Now, what I want to see is how the hell they're going to do the guitar part of the pro mode, because that's going to be weird.
1728467	1731068	You know, Tiger Claw is in our chat right now and he said the same thing.
1731108	1735051	I was just thinking, Sky, it's an actual keyboard you can plug into your computer and use as a MIDI keyboard.
1735151	1738113	That just makes it like 10 times more awesome.
1738313	1739054	More awesomer.
1739494	1748960	And you can actually get a MIDI adapter to plug into any MIDI guitars, drums, or keyboards that you may have as well and use those in Rock Band.
1750541	1753463	So what do you guys think of Rock Band 3 so far from this news we're hearing?
1753854	1769081	Guitar Hero I am so excited Bohemian Rhapsody and Power of Love There were some other songs they announced too I don't have the whole list in front of me but it looks like it's going to be a pretty solid list lots of newer stuff but some of the old stuff too for fun
1770606	1771987	All right, we're going to get to our next news story.
1772027	1774629	But first, guys, I can't control tonight.
1774649	1776410	There is just so much breaking news.
1786598	1788220	The Tony for best mute.
1788240	1788680	No, I'm kidding.
1789020	1791182	Actually, we're going to go to Miklatov with a special report.
1791976	1796820	Yeah, apparently those rumors about a new 360 appear true.
1798061	1813513	It looks like they are redesigning the 360, and it will come with a 250 gigabyte hard drive, but most importantly, built-in Wi-Fi, so you don't have to pay $100 to be able to connect to the internet if you don't have a very long ethernet cable.
1813953	1816555	And it comes with a fork and a knife and a clock and a pillow.
1817911	1819412	That would be great, actually.
1819832	1820893	Then you could sleep on your 360.
1821773	1822894	No name for this yet, though, right?
1822954	1823174	No.
1824255	1824935	Foreign ads?
1825075	1826496	This is all leaking from foreign?
1826576	1828117	They're Italian, it looks like.
1830278	1831339	Can we trust the Italians?
1831399	1831839	I don't know.
1833860	1834601	They're dirty.
1835841	1836622	But it looks really cool.
1836822	1839984	It's very sleek, not so much slim.
1840944	1843646	And it looks like it could poke your eye out because it's also very pointy.
1844308	1846930	They also changed, of course, since it is going to be slimmer.
1847030	1854593	It's very similar to what they were showing in those leaked motherboard development unit pictures.
1854973	1859916	It's basically now going to be all integrated into one chip instead of having a separate GPU, CPU.
1860636	1867041	and they're going to have the ventilation on it cooling straight out above the chip instead of going through this duct work that they had in there.
1867602	1868562	So that was kind of neat.
1868903	1872565	I do want to tell you guys, I guarantee you it is not called the 360 Slim.
1872746	1876609	It's only being called that because we're used to this kind of redesign thing from Sony's end.
1877089	1878030	They call it the Slim.
1878470	1881873	Microsoft will call this something else, which we'll hear tomorrow.
1881993	1882653	The 360 Cinched.
1882993	1883194	Yes.
1883354	1884575	That's what it looks like.
1884915	1887317	The 360 Slightly Smaller or the 180.
1887377	1887557	Connect.
1890319	1891700	It might not even get a new name, though.
1891760	1896123	I mean, you can come out with a new system design and still call it the same thing.
1896563	1896863	That's true.
1896903	1898464	They might just call it the Xbox 360.
1899165	1904088	When they redesigned the old, old Nintendo to be top-loading or whatever, it didn't have a different name.
1904148	1904508	That's true.
1904928	1913754	And we've already heard about the fact that Microsoft kind of wants to reboot the system and include Natal, excuse me, Kinect as a part of the new system.
1914134	1914294	Yeah.
1914834	1915475	Guarantee it.
1915535	1924962	There will be bundles on the shelves this Christmas with the pointy 360 with Wi-Fi and Kinect all in one box with Kinect Sports or Kinect Kitties or whatever that game was.
1925362	1930686	One of those BS games all together for the low, low price of $250 we'll say.
1931067	1932247	Let's hope.
1932508	1932948	$300 I bet you.
1933328	1935010	That sounds more realistic.
1935670	1936030	Perhaps.
1936851	1941935	But they'll also sell Netflix and whatever else they're going to announce tomorrow whether it be Hulu or anything else.
1942455	1942916	So we'll see.
1943717	1944478	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1960549	1961270	Tornadoes don't blare.
1961290	1962530	That's the sirens that blare.
1962611	1963191	Tornadoes spin.
1963211	1963992	The tornado is coming.
1964092	1968715	Okay, so if the tornado doesn't knock out your connection, you might have to call us once in a while with your breaking news.
1968735	1969515	With my breaking news?
1969575	1969776	Yes.
1970576	1974499	I'll be like, I just played a retro game on Xbox Live Game Room.
1974859	1975580	It was stupid.
1976080	1976701	Breaking news.
1977021	1977241	Yes.
1977641	1981484	Actually, let's fast forward to next week.
1981524	1984106	Miklatov will call in live to the show and it'll go something like this.
1994571	2000453	Yes, it looks like that Miklatov is calling into the show.
2000573	2002353	He's calling in with some breaking news.
2002773	2007315	Let's go live to Miklatov and see what is going on in gaming news.
2007395	2007995	Miklatov.
2008015	2008975	Signal in toilet.
2010455	2011436	Signal in toilet.
2012876	2013896	Signal in toilet.
2015317	2016297	Signal in toilet.
2017375	2021676	I'm sorry, apparently there's been a takeover of our feed from Understation Live.
2021696	2025317	I don't know what that is all about, but that just wasn't funny.
2025758	2027198	All right, let's move on.
2027998	2029999	Loki, do you have some gaming news for us?
2030379	2034380	Yes, it's regarding rumors about the 3DS.
2034620	2043363	Apparently there's reports out saying that the system is more powerful than the Wii, and unlike what was previously thought, it will not be using the new NVIDIA chips.
2044263	2055428	Um, apparently both IGN and Eurogamer have been reporting that, uh, developers have said off the record, which is funny because they're reporting on it, so if it was off the record, wouldn't it be not reported on it?
2055448	2056548	Because that would be on the record?
2057468	2057708	Okay.
2058449	2061310	Um, that the handheld won't use the Nvidia Tegra chip.
2062270	2075177	Also, YourGamer is saying that the 3DS hardware is internally known as CTR, suggesting that the motherboard image submitted to the FCC in May, which noted CTR as a codename, was indeed the 3DS.
2075917	2083481	One of the things that's kind of interesting, Kotaku I know posted a mock-up of what they thought the 3DS would look like based off of what they saw on the website.
2083961	2091603	It's funny that they didn't really pick up on the analog nub that was on there since it looks exactly like the analog nub on the PSP.
2091983	2094844	But yes, it will have an analog nub on there.
2094884	2100465	Of course, the top screen is going to be widescreen, bottom screen not widescreen.
2100485	2107407	Of course, they're going to have some sort of toggle on there to adjust how much 3D is on there, I guess.
2107767	2111068	You can adjust, I guess, the depth field or whatever.
2113529	2129880	And according to IGN also, they're saying that several developers have experienced 3DS in its current form and have reported off the record that its processing capabilities far exceed the Nintendo Wii and bring the device up with abilities that are close to the HD consoles such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2130940	2139644	If that's the case, thank God, Nintendo, you finally did something right and actually put out a console that has better tech than what's already out there.
2139704	2143887	Instead of saying, well, it's not going to be about technology, it's going to be about the gameplay.
2143927	2144607	Because guess what?
2144647	2145747	Now the gameplay is all the same.
2145867	2148809	So it's got to be about the tech now.
2149229	2156933	That's going to be kind of weird to see what the Wii is going to do with all these new motion controllers and stuff like that now that they're kind of on an even playing field.
2160626	2166548	It kind of intrigues me that a handheld system could possibly be as powerful as some of the stuff that's in our living room.
2166568	2167349	I mean, it makes sense.
2167749	2176433	The technology, I mean, this cycle of video games really has lasted longer than I think a lot of people have expected it to.
2176493	2179994	And you remember they came out and said, PlayStation 3 is going to have a 10-year life cycle.
2180014	2181675	360 is going to have these long life cycles.
2182015	2186557	And it seems to really be happening because usually we should be hearing about new consoles this year at E3.
2186837	2187698	But that's not going to happen.
2188098	2191759	And I don't know if you want to blame the economy or the investment on these or what.
2191839	2192539	I don't really know.
2192919	2196720	But the point is, you know, these consoles are still there.
2197220	2198520	And the technology is a little bit old.
2199721	2202421	It's interesting to me, though, that now the handhelds have already caught up.
2202481	2204982	Because I think a lot of us also kind of think, oh, well, Nintendo.
2206042	2208303	Let's see, the Advance was basically a Super Nintendo.
2209203	2211143	The DS was basically a Nintendo 64.
2211423	2213544	So logically, the next system is basically a...
2214484	2215065	GameCube.
2215565	2218289	And then again, the Wii is also kind of basically a GameCube, isn't it?
2219190	2219970	Damn, WiiCube.
2220311	2223134	And they also usually do improve it like a little bit, right?
2223534	2223995	Am I crazy?
2226109	2228451	They kind of, like, you know, it would be improved, like, a little bit.
2228491	2232534	Like, the DS felt like a little more than just a Nintendo 64, is it just me?
2233295	2239320	But they need a new gimmick because, I mean, if you want to play touchscreen games now, I mean, you have the iPhone, you have the iPad.
2241322	2249128	You know, it's not really any more... I mean, they're not the unique game system out there anymore.
2249469	2253292	And now, with, you know, this new system, now that they have 3D...
2254954	2263176	No other system is doing that right now unless PlayStation announces a new PSP which will be 3D as well because I'm sure they will try to do something like that.
2263427	2266409	And it'll be digital downloads only because it's an experiment.
2267650	2268591	We'll get to that in a little bit.
2268951	2270272	Let's do some comments from our chat room.
2270313	2275577	Chat.OrangeLionTradio.com Jay Dizzle wants you all to know he's connecting on the toilet right now.
2276297	2284624	Tiger Claw says, you know, don't be surprised if Sony announces the PSP2 with 3D support if you buy the 3D add-on glasses, which will probably be their way to counter the 3DS.
2285184	2285485	I don't know.
2286305	2288447	SSJ100Matt says, so this is a confirmed rumor?
2288507	2290809	Stop talking to us in riddles and oxymorons, dammit.
2292308	2298713	Bochikawa says, this might be a good move for Nintendo, putting their cards in the mobile market and selling the Wii or predecessors to soccer moms and six-year-olds.
2299334	2301295	It's actually really not a bad strategy.
2301696	2303137	It's been working for them so far.
2303557	2303917	Why not?
2305719	2306319	Here's my problem.
2306960	2308481	And you're gonna hate this, but...
2309758	2314861	My problem with Nintendo is I don't think they know how to deal with new hardware as far as advanced stuff.
2314901	2318883	Because if you notice, what were some of the games that we got when the Wii came out?
2319563	2320403	GameCube ports.
2321084	2324306	What are some of the games that we got on the Nintendo DS?
2324366	2328848	Basically ports of stuff that was on Nintendo 64 and that kind of stuff.
2328868	2332650	See, I was about to jump in there and say, but OMG, the Zelda game, it was amazing.
2332670	2334851	And then, oh yeah, there was a GameCube version of that.
2335552	2337594	Exactly, it was a GameCube port.
2338715	2345161	Granted, they're going to have this wonderful new shiny hardware and they're going to be able to do really amazing stuff, but it won't come right away.
2345441	2351506	It's going to be, oh look, we were working on this game for the DS, but now that we have the 3DS, let's just port it over and it'll be in 3D.
2351767	2353128	But the graphics will be really simple.
2353448	2378472	I have a crazy thought really crazy super crazy thought you guys here's my crazy thought we know that there's a new Zelda game that's supposed to be coming at E3 this year right and that it's supposed to be like a better looking type of game it's going to be you know kind of specially designed and it's going to be uber and all that stuff what if the Zelda game is actually a 3DS game well I'm sure they will have a 3DS Zelda game but I think it's actually going to be on the Wii hmm
2379294	2400204	I'm most worried about the screen size now the rumored screen size to be the size of the DSi screens because I picked up an XL because I'm a Nintendo whore at least in the handheld sense and I can't go back I mean that screen really does not lose that much resolution in my opinion and it'd be really nice to have another system with screens that big
2400615	2405496	I want to point out too, Miklatov is actually in studio right now wearing a 1-Up beanie, so he's not lying.
2405536	2408998	And I'm not talking about that website, I'm talking about the actual 1-Up mushroom.
2409398	2409578	Yes.
2409718	2410078	There it is.
2410778	2411178	Very nice.
2412178	2417000	Speaking of rumored games that are coming out for the 3DS, Destructoid has ran a story.
2417020	2422982	According to their sources, they strongly believe that Nintendo has been getting the developers and publishers over with the 3DS.
2424002	2429967	Demo of Animal Crossing apparently is an internal demo that they're showing off to developers to try and get people over.
2430808	2435652	That is the game that's supposed to be revealed this next week as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS.
2436092	2442478	Nintendo went back into a corner and said comment on this, dammit, has said Nintendo does not comment on rumors or speculation.
2442798	2446301	Listen Nintendo, if you're putting out another Animal Crossing game, I'm not fucking buying it.
2446641	2447182	You know why?
2447522	2451845	It's because the last two games you've put out have been exactly the same as the first one except with less features.
2452679	2456941	So go fuck yourself with your fucking Animal Crossing because I am... What if... Hold on.
2457241	2457481	Anger.
2457741	2458201	Angry man.
2458481	2459682	Angry man sitting over there in the chair.
2460342	2460722	Hold on.
2461102	2464644	What if they've actually made changes?
2464764	2466364	They won't.
2466404	2467685	They've actually made changes.
2468285	2471106	What if... What if... Stay with me here.
2473140	2475020	Hell had ice in it.
2476481	2480181	And if you would put it kindly, froze over.
2480901	2483782	Actually, if you read the Inferno, the core of hell is icy.
2486642	2492003	Yes, but the hell that Nintendo is familiar with does not have ice in it.
2493284	2494004	No, I'm sorry.
2495224	2498125	The only thing I can see them doing is adding 3D to it.
2498265	2500585	It's really going to be the same fucking game all over again.
2501935	2503095	They might add a new fruit.
2503735	2504255	There you go.
2504636	2506316	That would make people buy it.
2506336	2518218	And they might take out your villagers and put them in the city now because, you know, that's... Wait, what if, what if, what if, stay with me here, what if, what if they gave the animals machine guns?
2519178	2519798	Never forget.
2521439	2523039	They will never give them machine guns.
2523299	2524439	They'll give them squirt guns.
2527320	2527740	Paintball.
2529178	2531740	That paintball would be cool.
2531760	2534581	Question, question, question, question, question.
2535062	2539064	What was the best part about Animal Crossing when you would play it for the first time?
2539488	2545430	Hitting the people with the net Terrorizing the animals in your village, correct?
2545530	2559414	Digging holes around them so they couldn't move Exactly What if Nintendo made a game that was nothing but terrorizing your villagers in Animal Crossing So they're going to bring the Sims to the DS?
2559534	2559774	Or the 3DS?
2562575	2565016	Like, I realize, you know what DarkSakura used to do?
2565056	2567417	She would make gay pride flags and put them outside of people's houses.
2567457	2571159	That's because I had a lesbian in my town.
2571379	2574340	I had the chick that had the P.E.
2574380	2574660	room.
2575701	2576381	What was she, a duck?
2577265	2578625	I don't know.
2578665	2579906	They just replaced like a letter.
2580126	2592830	But she was wearing sweats and had PE equipment and she would ask questions that could be taken the wrong way so we put a big rainbow sign outside of her house.
2593550	2595651	She was our town lesbian and then she moved to Rob's town.
2595671	2596131	Hold on.
2596331	2597973	Hold on, hold on, this is great.
2598414	2601918	Give me a gold star stat, because a chatter just won a gold star here.
2601998	2603820	Get me a gold star stat for this comment.
2604281	2608046	BauerCTU says, animal double crossing.
2608947	2609267	Love it.
2609607	2609928	Love it!
2610629	2611470	Reggie, you listening?
2613069	2613929	Thanks for watching!
2632842	2659135	so I mean come on it's not going to steal away sales from the Wii it's just going to be really kick ass and you know what you can do you can sell your wonderful virtual console games as downloadable content for Animal Crossing there's a thought but it would be a creative thought and embracing digital content and online something Nintendo does not do it's the scariest thing in the world to them
2661799	2663121	This is going to be an interesting E3.
2663161	2664904	Everybody's kind of punchy in studio tonight.
2664944	2665565	I kind of like this.
2665685	2666426	It's fun.
2667668	2668830	God, just think about the show.
2671934	2672974	Alright, more news.
2673694	2675675	I'm done with this 3DS thing until I get to see it.
2675715	2687397	I will say, the plan right now, in quotes, unless something super awesome is revealed in the next couple days that we decide we have to see on the show floor, Miklatov and I plan to go run and see the 3DS first.
2687437	2687998	I won't run.
2688398	2689798	I might walk a little fast.
2689838	2691378	We'll walk in accelerated pace.
2691718	2692319	I'm kind of old.
2692839	2696860	So we'll walk with a cane in an accelerated pace towards the 3DS line.
2699100	2722203	uh over at Nintendo because the thought is everybody's still going to be at Sony's press conference so we want to do the 3DS thing first so we're hoping that'll be on the first show Tuesday night Rob Roberts and pals all right uh Loki let's do something besides the 3DS what you got for us um well let's see the PSP Go apparently was an experiment according to Sony they're claiming that um
2723820	2725682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2745561	2750422	Um... That sounds like a poor excuse for the reason why your console failed.
2750922	2759384	Not because your console was, I don't know, $80 more than, say, the same console that had media already.
2759684	2768687	Basically had all the same features, except the ability to actually, you know, buy disc-based games and be able to sell those games back when you're done with them.
2769487	2769587	Um...
2770727	2775610	If you really wanted to know where your consumer behavior was, put out a fucking survey.
2775871	2777892	You don't need to create a new console.
2779733	2782815	It was a failure, and that's what it was.
2782855	2784076	Do not call it an experiment.
2784216	2785297	It was a failure.
2789372	2793657	I don't know, it's just kind of one of those like, boy, they ran away with their tail between its legs.
2793697	2794438	I mean, is this it?
2794498	2802086	Is this kind of like an official confirmation, you think, of the fact that it's a done deal and the PSP Go is no longer going to be sold?
2802146	2803187	I mean, what's the deal?
2803708	2804088	I don't know.
2804128	2805850	Have you heard anything about this getting pulled from shelves?
2806051	2807632	No, I haven't heard anything, but let me put it this way.
2807652	2810636	I mean, they haven't really been selling like hotcakes, I mean, at all.
2811216	2812057	What do you expect?
2812097	2820442	You're putting out a console to your retailers and you're saying, oh, by the way, your customers aren't going to be able to buy any sort of software for this from you.
2821842	2823443	But you can sell our console for us.
2823563	2827486	Oh, by the way, you're not going to make any money off those consoles because consoles have no markup whatsoever.
2827986	2834990	So, yeah, go ahead and sell this for no sort of profit whatsoever and then you're not going to profit for it later on.
2835390	2838112	Most consumers or retailers out there are going to go,
2839112	2843856	How about fuck you, and I'm just going to carry the regular PSP where I can sell the same games.
2844417	2850982	And by the way, not all the games were available digitally right away anyways, so what's the point?
2852043	2854045	And that's the problem, is they pissed everybody off.
2854245	2858428	It was also more expensive than the PSP was, which made no fucking sense whatsoever.
2860210	2862532	So it was just a bad...
2863999	2864959	Bad plan altogether.
2865899	2872721	You should have charged less for it since it didn't have UMD drive and it would have gotten people to actually maybe pick it up.
2873201	2888825	But there was absolutely no reason whatsoever to pick up a PSP Go because you could just buy a PSP 3000 and a memory unit and have basically the exact same thing and the flexibility to either buy your games on disk or buy them via digital download.
2891605	2895167	Oh, I missed all the PSP hate, and I hate it too, the go.
2895207	2895948	I thought it was dumb.
2896928	2898409	I will share a quick little story.
2898850	2907695	At the store I work at, which I'm sure I can't name or get fired, we have sold, I kid you not, since the system came out, three.
2908476	2908936	Just three.
2909677	2912859	And I talked everybody that I could out of it, because...
2913659	2918342	I mean, like you're saying, a PSP-3000 with a decent-sized memory stick.
2918783	2922025	Just as good and way better, actually, than the Go could ever be.
2922509	2927151	Well, you know, if you buy the Sony memory sticks, then maybe it might be, you know, somewhat of a good deal.
2927231	2934933	But since everybody doesn't, you know, double the retail price of their memory units, you could go buy a third-party SanDisk memory stick and it'd be just fine.
2937034	2944216	And that's assuming if you want to download all your damn games, which most people are not going to do that because you can buy a PSP game on disk.
2944636	2945917	And when you're done with it, guess what?
2946517	2949618	You could sell it and make your money back.
2950058	2954101	Don't forget about our friend who has had all the trouble with his downloads, too.
2954321	2959364	Yeah, I have no problem with those digital download games that are only available via digital download.
2959624	2960125	But guess what?
2960145	2962706	With the PSP 3000, you can also download those!
2963807	2969351	They just were trying to make it seem like the PSP Go was the only system able to access this marketplace.
2969631	2974254	And the problem was they were trying to basically compete with the iPhone or something like that.
2974374	2978317	But you kind of have to have those types of features in there, like GPS and...
2978837	2980758	Have you ever actually held one?
2995413	2995513	No.
2995713	2998694	Okay, they feel like plastic little toys.
2998874	2999634	They are awful.
2999974	3001294	You feel like you're going to break it.
3001414	3004075	Just that top screen alone does not feel very secure.
3004115	3009516	So when you're sliding it up and down, I can only imagine that it won't last, like it will break.
3011976	3022498	Quickly, kind of one big rumor, big, big rumor that's floating around about what we're going to hear in a couple days, namely Tuesday morning when Sony does their press conference, we may hear something about a PSP 2.
3022819	3025039	Do you think there's any truth to that rumor?
3025299	3033025	I think if it's going to come out, it's going to come out probably around the same time frame as Gran Turismo 3, which means in a few years.
3034526	3035467	You mean Gran Turismo 5?
3035627	3035987	Whatever.
3036007	3038449	5-3, it doesn't matter.
3039090	3041792	The game isn't coming up this year, that's what it matters.
3041992	3044334	At first, I was like, no, they're not doing it.
3044854	3048417	But now that I'm hearing this whole disavowing of the PSP Go...
3050685	3052466	It makes a lot more sense that that could be where they're going.
3052546	3055927	Three is the number of Forza games that will be out before Gran Turismo 5.
3057608	3057768	Right.
3058548	3060649	And I mean additional Forza games.
3060809	3062450	Beyond the third one we've already had.
3062470	3063410	Beyond two and three, yeah.
3064389	3065269	I like my PSP.
3065309	3067270	I think the PSP is a pretty good system.
3067630	3069430	It was lacking in games for a while.
3069510	3070610	I mean, yeah, Luminous was cool.
3070930	3073391	But it was really lacking in games for a while.
3073431	3075491	But then it started getting some real kick-butt stuff.
3075531	3078932	Especially with the Final Fantasy games were re-released for it.
3079292	3079992	It had some good stuff.
3080152	3081112	But I gotta be honest, though.
3081172	3084413	Even with just regular PSP, it's not been doing great.
3084653	3090274	I mean, even just talking to my retailers about bringing in PSP titles, they're really just...
3090914	3095619	Bringing in some to have them on the shelf, but it's not a big representation.
3096059	3099383	And that's kind of hurting them.
3099403	3104568	Especially now with the 3DS, people are going to be like, whatever, I'm not buying anything on the PSP.
3104968	3106670	So they've got to come out with something new.
3108212	3109193	Is it going to be out this year?
3109573	3110594	I highly doubt it.
3111511	3113172	Osfer brings up Valkyria Chronicles 2.
3113793	3115274	It looks like it might be pretty cool.
3115374	3119617	The Phantasy Star Portable 2 is also coming, which is somewhat big to people I know.
3119877	3126302	Alpha Catanagram in our chatroom is mentioning that there is a giant Kevin Butler E3 banner, apparently, at the convention center right now.
3126622	3129744	Actually, I need to say something since you mentioned Phantasy Star Portable.
3129764	3129964	Yeah.
3130764	3141589	My friend Krista, if you go on Sega's website and look at the contest that they did for doing fan art, she won third place doing pixel style art of the characters.
3142009	3142289	Yay.
3142309	3143530	So congratulations to Krista.
3143650	3144210	Congrats to you.
3144230	3144811	What does she win?
3145731	3146211	Copy the game.
3146711	3147732	Well, hey, that's something.
3148172	3149032	Free stuff is good.
3149913	3150153	All right.
3152170	3152712	Kingdom Hearts
3158348	3163970	Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts has got a new game announced at E3, but it's not the big number three.
3164010	3165751	It is Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
3165771	3167551	There was a rumor about this on last week's show.
3167591	3168752	It does look like it is official.
3169192	3171913	Kingdom Hearts Recoded is coming out for the DS.
3172253	3178375	It's by the same people that were behind 358 slash two days, and it will be on the show floor at E3.
3178795	3183477	It apparently is going to be a remake of the Japanese mobile game Kingdom Hearts Coded.
3183837	3185257	Just like they did with Chains of Memories.
3185277	3187298	Remember Kingdom Hearts Re Chains of Memories?
3187634	3187854	Yes.
3189395	3190576	No word on the release date yet.
3190616	3192197	We don't know if it's going to be this year or next.
3192657	3193718	Hopefully this Christmas.
3193838	3199202	But it will be about Sora retracing his steps through the original Kingdom Hearts.
3199962	3206046	Jiminy Cricket apparently is looking over the journal he used to document his first adventure with Sora and he discovers a mysterious message.
3206706	3207147	Interesting.
3207367	3208928	So it's not something he wrote?
3208968	3209748	So how did it get there?
3209969	3210389	I don't know.
3211109	3213151	Sounds confusing, just like the plot of Kingdom Hearts.
3213971	3215312	Which I roll my eyes to.
3216092	3216353	Why?
3217473	3218914	Kingdom Hearts is not that great.
3219695	3220635	It's just kind of boring.
3220876	3221536	I think it's pretty cool.
3221556	3223497	Was the message sitting on the toilet?
3227420	3229962	Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.
3230022	3231062	Jamie, you got something for us?
3232403	3232944	I have nuts.
3234445	3234805	Me too.
3237938	3241700	This one is actually about our good friends at Capcom.
3242961	3247324	It's their E3 lineup and I'm pretty excited.
3247764	3254268	Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Fate of Two Worlds, which by the way I saw the last trailer and it has Deadpool and Dante and that made me very squee.
3256612	3268023	Okamiden, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes, Ghost Trick Phantom Detective, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 2 Case Zero, MotoGP 910.
3270365	3273048	So it sounds like Capcom's booth is going to be pretty hopping.
3273108	3275250	I really hope Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is playable.
3275819	3277981	Take me lots of pictures and get me lots of swag.
3278202	3278482	I will.
3278762	3279483	I really want to play it.
3279843	3281145	I want Deadpool stuff.
3281205	3282546	I will play as Deadpool just for you.
3283087	3283547	You better.
3283927	3285249	And he'll be terrible.
3285429	3287651	Yeah, I will because I'm terrible at Marvel vs. Capcom.
3287831	3289753	But Deadpool has guns and snark.
3290134	3290855	Actually, that's not true.
3290875	3294999	When I played at that retro arcade a couple weeks ago in Portland, I just kind of button mashed and I did pretty good.
3296812	3305876	all I you just do you know it's all Street Fighter moves like quarter circle forward and and back and forward and you know it's just all it's all Street Fighter moves you just do a bunch of Street Fighter moves and then your characters are going well
3307150	3307550	Dead Rising 2 K-Zero
3334934	3337120	Showing off a demo at E3 of a demo.
3337882	3338644	A demo of a demo.
3338824	3339185	Good times.
3339627	3339847	Loki.
3341817	3353004	There was an editorial written on Kotaku this week talking about the trend going on with these new sports games from THQ and EA.
3354145	3365733	You may remember the one-time use online codes that are part of the Project $10, or I guess in THQ's case, we want another $5 from you.
3368174	3371417	I just thought there were some points that were kind of interesting that they brought up in this.
3372498	3381586	Some of it kind of tying into will it really be that big a deal for consumers out there that are interested in buying used products because it's going to be additional money.
3382146	3388852	Well, they were saying that GameStop has been starting to drop in the trade-in values of different games.
3389273	3393356	For most new releases, which you used to be able to get for $30, you're now getting $25.
3394937	3419017	and also some of the games like for example UFC the use price is now $44.99 which is $5 cheaper than the other new releases so they're kind of factoring in okay you're going to pay another $5 to get online and it's going to bring it up to the price of a normal use game or a normal use game of that quality that time frame that kind of stuff.
3420038	3422320	Um, so maybe it won't be that big of an impact.
3422520	3437949	I still say don't forget what's going on, though, because as soon as you say, well, that's not so bad, you know, that's when they start going, okay, well, now you're gonna be having to pay for this, and you're gonna have to pay for this, and pay for this, and this, and this, and this, and just gonna go on and on.
3439510	3442572	But, um, also they're saying that, uh, the...
3444323	3449933	One-time use code has diminished resale expectations.
3451155	3455743	They're saying that people who tend to be passionate about games on their consoles...
3457932	3462357	I haven't been selling them back in.
3462397	3463478	I don't know.
3463638	3464539	It's interesting, though.
3465700	3467202	I guess this is going to keep going on.
3467562	3477532	Remember, there was a rumor, and I'm sure we're not going to hear anything about it until the game comes out, but it is a few weeks from now that Microsoft will be following suit with Crackdown 2.
3477573	3478433	Get ready.
3481144	3488609	I'm kind of irritated because yet another reason that I don't know if it was so obvious at first, but it just diminishes the value of the game to be able to resell.
3489110	3496695	Even if you do get the $10 code for free when it's new, if you use it, it's totally diminishing the value of the game that you sell back.
3497236	3499557	And that I think is probably one of the most irritating components of this.
3499878	3505282	But at the end of the day, the only way that you can express your distaste
3506087	3506567	Thanks for watching!
3525414	3551985	I don't buy used games anymore and a lot of stuff if I'm going to buy it in the first place I'm buying it new if I'm not buying it right when it comes out new then I'm not going to buy it at all so for me since this is really just affecting used games and stuff like that it's not a big deal now if I wanted to loan it to a friend or something like that that kind of sucks for them but I don't really run into that situation that much
3553786	3558288	DarkSakura's got guys in their skeevies over there.
3558328	3559288	What is going on over there?
3559348	3561329	I was just picking his pajamas.
3561449	3563010	That's not pajamas.
3563230	3566271	I've known guys who just sleep in their underwear.
3566371	3567771	No, I know, but I'm just saying.
3568292	3569832	It's just funny because I looked over.
3569852	3570913	I'm like, what is she playing?
3571093	3574154	I don't like the pajamas in the game, so I just had him sleep in his undies.
3575254	3577415	But his undies are Calvin Klein.
3577455	3579016	I downloaded Calvin Klein undies.
3579176	3581437	You should get him bananas in pajamas.
3585067	3588268	If you really want, I don't care.
3589668	3590369	Sorry, Loki.
3590849	3591349	I looked over there.
3591369	3594050	I'm like, is DarkSakura watching porn during this program?
3594070	3594690	What is she doing?
3595370	3596091	What is she doing?
3597451	3597691	All right.
3598131	3599952	Yeah, it's just interesting because...
3602188	3617701	I don't know, it just seems to me their excuses for why they're doing it being that they're going to enhance the online, enhance all this community stuff I just have a feeling they're not going to deliver with that in that it's just a desperate cash grab
3618241	3619342	If they really do that, that's cool.
3619382	3622405	I'm fine with the extra $10 or whatever they're saying.
3623206	3630053	Otherwise, it's just taking a key component of the game and charging you for it when it should already be there as part of the normal cost.
3630774	3633556	My problem is why they're getting money anyways for a used sale.
3634317	3636239	They really shouldn't deserve that kind of money.
3636559	3637259	No, they don't.
3637279	3638360	I have a comment about that.
3662546	3675359	With UFC, didn't they implement that so badly that some people that even bought it brand new got double charged because the directions weren't clear when you'd enter the code and it would actually make you pay for the code and then you could use your code?
3675699	3677781	I think I read stuff about that when it came out.
3677861	3678301	I don't know.
3679763	3682926	I'm not surprised if that's what actually happened.
3687661	3689782	Alright, well, moving on.
3689982	3691842	Boy, I'm just seeing this from chat.
3691862	3692903	Somebody just posted this in chat.
3692923	3694023	You need the breaking news noise.
3694063	3695323	Do I need the breaking news noise?
3695363	3696204	Because that's ugly.
3696364	3697784	I don't have the breaking news noise.
3698944	3700505	Buy me some time.
3700525	3701225	Buy me some time.
3702125	3703686	Quick.
3703706	3705446	Breaking noise, breaking noise, breaking noise.
3705486	3706247	Breaking noise.
3707907	3709830	Breaking news, breaking news, blah blah blah.
3710251	3720247	I could talk about how I am breeding stuff in Pokemon and I bike back and forth on the path so it hatches the eggs quicker because I don't like to run around.
3721750	3721870	And...
3724020	3725380	And it's still very popular in Japan.
3754106	3757589	You can play this game.
3757609	3760291	I guess a new version of pop music has been announced, but here's the thing.
3760751	3766195	It is like a US version now because they're testing this in Irvine, California.
3766215	3769517	It's a ticket redemption machine.
3769978	3771058	I hate you, Konami.
3771439	3772820	I hate you so much.
3773360	3775622	The logo looks like it's from Beat and Groovy.
3775922	3776562	It kind of does.
3777642	3779203	Konami, you just don't get it anymore.
3779303	3779984	You're fired.
3780684	3781885	I'm firing you, Konami.
3781905	3783327	You cannot make any more music games.
3786601	3790824	Konami, a company that thinks Saw is a viable franchise for video games.
3791064	3792826	That Saw game was not awful.
3793146	3796048	I will defend that game because it was fun except for the combat.
3796068	3798230	The combat was dumb, but the puzzles were fun.
3798450	3799010	I liked them.
3799811	3801392	You just like to kill people horrifically.
3801772	3802913	With really good puzzles.
3804374	3806216	It's like evil Professor Layton.
3806496	3807737	That should be a game right there.
3807817	3808717	Kill them with puzzles.
3809598	3809878	For the 3DS.
3811340	3816205	Ray Ayanami in our chat says, Sky, and you keep saying Konami needs to redesign their rhythm games.
3817227	3818128	That's not what I meant!
3819169	3820210	That's not what I fucking meant!
3821731	3822492	Ticket game?
3822993	3824555	I'm not surprised, one bit.
3824935	3825716	It'll be popular.
3826880	3832368	If the Deal or No Deal game is popular, no, this won't be because it's not something you see on TV with Howie Mandel.
3832889	3833230	True.
3833690	3838738	Bobby's World, the Ticket Redemption game, that would be something that would be popular with Howie Mandel.
3838798	3840821	And he's on the... America's Got Talent.
3840881	3841643	Yeah, that show.
3844180	3851444	Speaking of the Saw type things and so forth, there was a lot of news that came out this week about Mortal Kombat.
3852184	3857167	And one of them was this very strange teaser that was a mystery and nobody knew what it was.
3857267	3858768	I'm trying to play a little bit here in studio.
3858848	3859368	Is it loud?
3859388	3859728	Sorry.
3859748	3860169	No, this.
3860289	3860749	No, no.
3860769	3861049	That one?
3865034	3866075	This thing that came out this week.
3866155	3866696	Oh, that?
3866916	3867176	Yes.
3868157	3870200	That's supposed to be like reptile.
3871201	3871501	Right?
3871601	3873663	Yeah, no, that's actually old.
3873964	3876046	The guy was friends with Jerry Ryan, which is why she's in it.
3877350	3880813	This actually is a few months old.
3880833	3881953	And Jerry Ryan's in it.
3899986	3900787	Jerry Ryan is in it.
3900807	3901868	She's Sonya at the very end.
3901889	3903250	Let me see if I can fast forward the part.
3903330	3907536	And Johnny Cage is the motion actor for Nathan Drake from Uncharted 1.
3908116	3908577	Is it really?
3908617	3909518	Well, there's Jerry Ryan.
3912660	3913761	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3938278	3941339	I love these reimagining pitches though.
3941379	3945240	I saw the one for Nightmare on Elm Street before they had decided to redo it.
3945860	3947040	That some guy just funded.
3947421	3952922	It's kind of a really ballsy thing for them to do is to put it up on the internet for all the public scrutiny.
3953302	3957543	The guy must have believed in the thing that much and so far the reception's been pretty positive.
3958163	3958543	I don't know.
3958844	3959604	I gotta be honest.
3959704	3961084	I'm gonna go against the grain a little bit.
3961484	3963585	I think it's well done and it's nice but...
3964705	3968587	I always kind of liked Mortal Kombat because it was a little bit over the top and cartoony.
3969228	3973310	And that was a little bit like gritty, real saw for me.
3973470	3973890	I don't know.
3973991	3975351	I don't know how I feel about that.
3976032	3981055	I don't know if that's how the movie would actually turn out, but I was kind of like, I kind of like Mortal Kombat because it was always a little bit ridiculous.
3981075	3982455	The first one did it best.
3983176	3984737	The second one was a waste of time.
3986141	3991002	But I'm all for, I guess, them trying to give this guy a chance, especially since so many people seem to be into it.
3991083	3994364	I mean, just because I have one opinion, you know, whatever, I guess I might get outvoted.
3994924	3997424	So, I guess it could be cool.
3997484	4004527	But it was really seven minutes of this cop interrogation, and I would just hope the movie is a little... Well, no, it wasn't just the interrogation.
4004587	4006807	It was... Yeah, I guess it had the fight with Johnny Cage.
4006847	4008928	It was like introducing the characters.
4009648	4011749	I thought it was awesome, and they should totally make the movie.
4014195	4014975	We'll see, we'll see.
4014995	4016596	This is my least favorite character in the series.
4016616	4018177	Poor Johnny Cage, can't catch a break.
4019037	4022339	I did like doing the foot through the heart and then signing the autograph.
4022379	4023059	That was kind of cool.
4024580	4041208	Alright, well also, you know, because a lot of people did mistake that this might have been a teaser for the game, apparently there really was a teaser for the game in the works and it showed up a little later, just literally a few days later, a new teaser for Mortal Kombat 9 showed up.
4042188	4042508	and DarkSakura.
4066347	4067568	I'd like to see more characters added.
4067608	4072392	I know this is just a teaser, but they didn't pick some of the best, that's for sure.
4094764	4096565	Yeah, that hat on the ground is really funny.
4096585	4110373	For those that haven't seen the trailer, Kung Lao puts the hat on the ground and it starts spinning like a circular saw and he starts grabbing Sub-Zero and pulling him towards it like he's going to rip his body in half with the saw, starting with his wiener.
4112954	4114095	Yeah, interesting.
4116076	4121479	A little bit over the top, but I don't know, again, they're starting to get a little too realistic.
4121639	4123660	I don't know, I liked Mortal Kombat when it was cartoony and dumb.
4123942	4125865	I can't believe we're at 9, like you said.
4125905	4130431	That's an insane amount for a lot of forgettable titles in the series.
4130652	4132855	I always kind of had an appreciation for Mortal Kombat.
4132875	4135238	I always thought a lot of them were really underrated and they're a lot of fun.
4135519	4138103	They're just dumb fun and that's the important part of the game.
4138904	4139344	So there you go.
4141367	4144151	That is supposedly also at the E3 show floor.
4144171	4147435	There are some big banners hanging from the ceiling teasing the new Mortal Kombat game.
4147475	4149878	So I know I definitely want to stop by and check that out.
4149898	4150799	I wonder if we can get one.
4151279	4153422	Like you could prop me up and I'll... No, the banner.
4153862	4156646	Prop me up and I'll take it down and we'll steal it.
4156666	4160350	You know the show floor is like... Or the ceiling is, you know...
4161051	4161631	DarkSakura.com
4186161	4188222	All right, let's move on to some release dates.
4188282	4193143	Travel around the world and talk about what is coming out soon to a retail store near you.
4193283	4196264	We go to the UK and the US and Japan.
4196284	4197725	We're going to start off with Loki in the US.
4198805	4203927	Yes, you know it's going to be a wonderful week since the biggest title coming out this week is Toy Story 3.
4205127	4210809	Toy Story 3 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP and PC.
4212702	4213902	And now the rest of the crap.
4214683	4218023	Let's play Garden, coming out on DS this week.
4218604	4222405	And on the Wii, let's play Ballerina, coming out on DS and the Wii.
4222705	4224205	Let's play Ballerina!
4224225	4225145	100 classic books.
4225625	4229626	The only game released on the DS that actually wasn't rated by the ESRB.
4229787	4231647	The most boring video game ever made.
4231667	4232827	Because it's books.
4233768	4236508	I think that'd be a great, great $20 spent.
4236828	4238769	Video game called Let's Go to the Library.
4239828	4242951	Legend of K coming to the Nintendo DS.
4243931	4247534	XGBlast, supposed to be like a shmup game, coming to the Nintendo DS.
4248775	4252878	Superbike World Championship, SBK, coming to the PS3.
4252958	4253799	It's a budget game.
4256061	4256441	What else?
4256521	4257822	Kid Adventure Sky Captain.
4258082	4259122	Actually, this one looks okay.
4259162	4260983	It's kind of like Pilotwings on the Wii.
4261204	4262264	Also only a budget game.
4263045	4266167	And then this is the kind of stuff that Konami keeps putting out.
4266247	4267147	Thank you, Konami.
4267187	4267888	You're wonderful.
4267988	4270129	Yard Sale, Hidden Treasures, Sunnyville.
4270529	4273531	Guess where you're going to find this game in a yard sale.
4273551	4273811	Wait, wait.
4273971	4274592	Sunnyvale?
4275132	4275872	Sunnyville.
4276092	4278114	Oh, I was going to say it's like a game set in Sunnyvale.
4278134	4278694	That's kind of cool.
4278959	4284582	ThinkSmart Western Riding Academy Naval Assault The Killing Tide Xbox 360
4305013	4331805	and another crappy game on the Wii Family Game Show which is gonna be some stupid party game by a company I've never heard of, Storm City Games and last but not least I Spy Universe, who gives a shit I don't care what system it's on the end Ray Ayanami in chat says there aren't enough games set in the SF Bay Area how about every racing game ever made always has like some type of San Francisco stage because of the hills
4333539	4340748	Although I will tell you, in real life, folks, you go about three miles an hour down all of those roads because there's always traffic.
4340968	4349539	It's going to have a San Francisco level because you know San Francisco, what it's most known for, earthquakes, because every game that has a disaster in it, San Francisco has the earthquakes.
4349619	4351501	Cruising USA, heads.
4353277	4354538	Blur has a San Francisco level.
4354638	4355058	They all do.
4355519	4356159	Every single one of them.
4356199	4357680	Mario Kart has a San Francisco level.
4357700	4358121	That's right.
4358741	4360422	It's called Toad San Francisco Adventure.
4360442	4363425	Speaking of Blur, by the way, in Mario Kart, did you see that commercial?
4363605	4364566	It is amazing.
4364686	4365927	That is the best thing I've seen.
4367348	4373873	Dan was watching Classic Game Room and it was the leading in commercial and I laughed my butt off.
4374033	4374553	Good times.
4375054	4378636	What are you fitting your little guy in panties over there?
4378696	4380758	He looks like he's wearing panties, manties.
4381337	4390067	I'm picking his bathing suit and I'm just trying out different fabric patterns Guys don't really wear that to the beach at least in America I realize like Greece it's a little different but we're all fat
4391852	4393613	I'm just trying different fabrics.
4393633	4394794	I just want to make sure.
4394834	4397436	You know, Nintendo should want to make sure you were aware.
4397976	4399237	I'll use gold sequins.
4399257	4399858	Gold sequins.
4400378	4410145	Nintendo should really come out with a commercial later on for its next Mario Kart game and say, yeah, Blur wants to go ahead and make fun of our games, but our game's still millions of copies.
4410525	4411145	Yours doesn't.
4411966	4412386	Fuck you.
4413567	4416348	It comes with a plate and a pillowcase and a clock
4442054	4443935	It is a whole big franchise out there.
4443975	4446095	There's actually an anime based on it as well.
4446175	4449457	So that's the Hakioki is coming out there on PS3.
4449477	4451057	So that's a pretty big release over there this week.
4452658	4460720	Also on the other systems, going to the Nintendo Wii, Hospital 6 Nin no Ishii is coming out in Japan from Atlus.
4460740	4462221	I don't know if this is a Trauma Center game.
4462301	4462861	No, it's not.
4462981	4464502	I guess it's maybe a spinoff or something.
4464542	4468223	It's just a different hospital game, but there is your mandatory chick with big boobs.
4468303	4468443	Mm-hmm.
4468763	4470404	No, that's Trauma Center.
4470564	4470964	Is it really?
4470984	4471924	Yeah, the one that we just got.
4471944	4472945	It looks like an anime or something.
4472985	4474505	The characters are exactly the same.
4474705	4475006	Really?
4475066	4476166	It just looks so different.
4477186	4479667	Trauma Team, that's what the American one's called.
4479807	4480068	Weird.
4480208	4483169	All right, well, maybe it's the release of Trauma Team then.
4487691	4490492	I define better Dark Sakura when you're showing me that guy.
4490592	4492312	How about Fishnet?
4493353	4493753	No, thank you.
4494507	4501391	Also on the Nintendo DS this week, Igokoro Koyushitsu comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.
4501891	4505293	And this is a game where apparently you... I don't even know what this is.
4505353	4508795	It's like apples on the cover with the stylus.
4509175	4510256	It's like Let's Draw Apples.
4510336	4511297	I wonder if it's a painting game.
4511457	4512017	I bet that's what it is.
4512037	4512657	It's a painting game.
4513438	4515139	Yeah, it's probably Let's Paint on the DS.
4515459	4516339	Learn how to paint apples.
4517380	4517820	Still life.
4518781	4520442	They did have a Let's Paint game on the Wii.
4520462	4520742	That is...
4521186	4521787	It's a painting game.
4523548	4527933	And then lastly on the PSP, nothing this week.
4528613	4532897	But next week you get Project D.Va from Sega on the PSP.
4533378	4534159	You have that to look forward to.
4534778	4536559	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
4537520	4537940	Stuff.
4538621	4540702	On the 13th, Mytheon for PC.
4541343	4544065	And the 16th, we have Ancients of Uga.
4544925	4545306	Okay.
4546387	4560097	And then on the 18th, we have Everybody's Tennis, I'm Not Alone, International Cricket 2010, Project Runway, and Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker on PSP.
4561978	4562398	and Amiro.
4562458	4562518	Yes.
4587935	4592378	Alright, let's talk a little bit about 3D on PS3.
4593079	4601245	That's right, this week we actually got an update on the PS3 firmware to allow for some games to support stereoscopic 3D.
4602726	4610712	These games, of course, would be Wipeout HD, Pain, Super Stardust HD, and Motorstorm Pacific Rift.
4610792	4613454	They have a demo, apparently, with I think one level that was in 3D.
4614516	4617961	and White Battle wants to see if his own 3D paint has a 3D level.
4619691	4628659	You know, that was actually one of the reasons that the... Back in the day, remember when they were doing the Gorillaz holographic thing for their concerts?
4629340	4630041	Uh-huh.
4630621	4641791	They were doing the projections and everything, and they said that they had to keep sound around it at a particular level, or it would start making the light waves start jitter.
4642532	4644694	And they had that problem when they did with Madonna.
4644714	4644794	Yeah.
4645614	4663679	because when her song started in it was that heavy bass and it made the holograms jitter well being that this isn't holograms hopefully we won't have that problem but it's still a matter of sight and perception and it's still the waves themselves are still a physical thing
4664144	4666526	The only holograms I want to see are fronted by Jim.
4667527	4671930	Now, this, I mean, looks kind of cool, but, you know, it's one of those things.
4672711	4680617	I'm not buying a new damn TV, and I'm not buying, you know, expensive glasses to go with these TVs just for some of these games.
4680737	4685300	It's one of those things where when the technology comes down in price in about five years, I think more people will have it.
4685340	4687702	But right now, I think this is a little too soon.
4688223	4691045	But I am so, like, over the 3D craze.
4691225	4691826	Like, I just...
4692686	4698049	I see all these movies coming out in 3D, like there's the Resident Evil movie in 3D, and the new Saws movie in 3D.
4698069	4699070	You don't need to be in 3D.
4699190	4701511	Everything is in 3D, and I'm over it.
4701711	4702752	3D movies make me sick.
4703412	4703753	Stop it.
4703973	4705233	I liked Avatar in 3D.
4707014	4710957	But Avatar, I would have felt just as fine with Avatar in 2D.
4712426	4714527	Having seen it both ways, I really did prefer it in 3D.
4714748	4715428	Well, here's the thing.
4715828	4723993	With Avatar or something like that, when they're filming that movie, it's just like a normal movie just filmed in 3D.
4724414	4733980	Whereas a lot of people, when you film something in 3D, they want to do a lot of stuff to really capitalize on the 3D, like throw stuff at you or have you fly around really fast or something like that.
4734640	4756640	and that's great and all but it's this isn't like an amusement park ride I mean we don't really need that kind of stuff just make a good movie and that'd be it now the motion box seats that's more amusement park fare and god please do not have that trend make its way to consoles I don't need a moving couch
4759292	4765937	Alright, well, another music game was announced this week that's going to be showing its way at the Florida E3 this year.
4766077	4767157	It's DJ Hero 2.
4768078	4771420	You know, some folks were saying that DJ Hero didn't really sell what they were hoping it would.
4771460	4773802	Although, didn't DJ Hero kind of keep selling?
4774062	4777224	Like, maybe it didn't sell a lot at the beginning, but it kind of has kept selling?
4777384	4777945	It's done okay.
4778165	4782047	I think for, like, a brand new franchise, you know, it did alright.
4782267	4789072	And considering how much they've supported their download content, in other words, not at all, I'm surprised it sold what it did.
4789552	4793617	Well, there was some content released this week in celebration of DJ Hero 2.
4793958	4796040	They did release some free content this week.
4796761	4803930	It is DJ Hero 2's mix for Just Dance by Lady Gaga with Ghosts and Stuff by Deadmau5.
4804230	4806813	Let's listen to a little bit of it here.
4818619	4821843	Yeah, it's alright.
4822363	4822884	Sounds kind of fun.
4823965	4826628	So 70 new songs are supposed to be coming to DJ Hero 2.
4827109	4831254	Kanye West, Chemical Brothers, Dr. Dre, Gaga, Rihanna, Metallica.
4831775	4833597	Lots and lots and lots of artists are going to be in this.
4834337	4838200	The sequel will also be putting in microphone gameplay.
4838580	4841141	It's also going to have a lot more of two turntables at once.
4841362	4845364	So literally you will have, yes, two turntables and a microphone.
4846104	4848126	How many times have you heard that joke this week?
4848146	4850267	They totally have to put Beck in there then.
4851278	4853601	Yeah, it's interesting that they have the karaoke mode in there.
4853621	4856103	I guess it's kind of cool to have an additional person playing.
4857125	4861430	I wonder if they didn't mention anything about guitar mode coming back.
4861850	4865355	So I'm wondering if they're going to do something special with that, if they're going to have band mode or something.
4865375	4866396	I hope they just scrapped it.
4866656	4866896	Outro Music
4888827	4890069	Oh, that's really cool.
4905726	4907307	Yeah, so a lot more stuff.
4907708	4916435	And they also said, you know those samples that you trigger and stuff, how they really have the annoying Flava Flav samples and stuff like that?
4916815	4920698	Well, now the samples are going to be tying in with the songs instead.
4920718	4922259	You're not going to be able to choose these different sample sets.
4922279	4922780	That's good.
4923400	4925541	TigerClaw says I mispronounced the name of that other artist.
4925561	4926462	It's DeadMouse.
4926602	4927543	Well, it's not my fault.
4927603	4929204	He has to type all week, speak, whatever.
4929224	4930284	He has an awesome mask.
4930304	4931145	Apparently he's in the game.
4931985	4932906	He has a giant mouse head.
4933166	4938590	We need some more like real dancey artists or real club artists like Pendulum.
4938690	4943733	They're supposed to be focusing it more on electronic artists this time.
4943893	4944353	I hope so.
4944373	4944913	Pendulum?
4945934	4948516	Pendulum would be awesome.
4948736	4951798	I'd buy the game day one more than I already will buy it day one.
4951938	4953139	Oh, I'm buying it day one as it is.
4953399	4957021	Even though I don't play the first one, I still want to go back to it.
4957321	4963265	I'm buying that day one and seeing it with Rock Band 3 with the keyboard because I totally want to play that.
4963405	4974953	I wonder if they'll improve the turntable at all because there were so many people that were having problems with buttons stop working and I have problems with the scratching doesn't always trigger.
4975498	4977579	Yeah, it's a little tricky sometimes.
4979120	4979380	I don't know.
4979520	4985282	I have a, what was it, a beta controller and I also have a regular controller.
4986203	4987223	I have a wired controller.
4988061	4988401	Nice.
4988742	4992305	Oh, I have the Wired360 one from the demo we had.
4992345	4993266	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4993346	4993906	Demo controller.
4994127	4994387	Yeah.
4995928	4996629	All right, folks.
4996669	5002775	Well, believe it or not, before we get to the end of Part A, I have to break, guys, because we do have some special news.
5003235	5003695	All right.
5012150	5012830	That's right.
5013050	5015231	We break for this special news report here.
5015351	5021414	Apparently, this comes to us thanks to Twitter, and Bobby sent this along and alerted me to what's going on here.
5021834	5025815	Apparently, the event is starting to get underway, the whole kinetic event.
5026275	5029657	They have forced the entire audience to wear ponchos.
5031257	5035118	They're all in these metallic poncho-looking things.
5035818	5041580	Apparently, the Xbox event will involve a splash zone or something.
5041740	5044421	I don't know what the hell is going on.
5044441	5047522	It's going to be they're hitting watermelons and talls.
5047702	5049282	They're repeating this Monday night.
5050343	5050863	Here's the thing.
5051463	5054644	Miklatov and I actually had the opportunity to go to this event, but a day late.
5055444	5058266	because they're redoing it tomorrow night and we were like, that's okay.
5059447	5061649	And now I'm really feeling that was a good idea.
5061809	5062190	I would.
5062630	5065152	That looks fun because I don't know.
5065172	5067094	I'd like to get watermelon on me or something.
5067114	5070376	Do you get to keep these little shoulder pad poncho things?
5070436	5073159	Everybody looks so happy in the pictures to be wearing them.
5073179	5076962	They're probably like, oh my God, I'm going to be a TV with this.
5080091	5081032	I'm not even joking.
5081092	5082293	Bobby, post a link in chat.
5082334	5082994	I know you're listening.
5083034	5083555	It's funny.
5083995	5084576	Good stuff.
5085417	5086258	Big silver.
5087039	5089862	But if everybody in the audience is wearing that, it's gonna look weird on TV.
5091377	5092497	You know what I was thinking though?
5092698	5097739	I was making the joke, I'm like, you know how these camera games just really suck and they don't work very well?
5097759	5099380	I'm like, is that what I need to wear?
5099400	5101201	Yeah, it's gonna come packaged in.
5101521	5104702	Well, you know how they had like, what is it, the stupid jumpsuits and stuff?
5104742	5110684	So, apparently the Kinect only works if you're wearing like a silly costume.
5111184	5112545	It's all silly costumes only.
5114747	5121892	Alright, we are getting to the end here of Part A on our show, but you know we cannot call it quits until we get to one more segment.
5121912	5125835	We have to do this segment every week, because if we don't, DarkSakura finds me down and threatens to kill me.
5126195	5127055	And sometimes she does.
5127716	5128597	It's the Classic Game of the Week!
5134000	5139164	DarkSakura's gonna dive into the vault and find a game she thinks you kids ought to be playing this week and respecting.
5139624	5142306	DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5142901	5145363	Today's classic game is Magician Lord.
5146044	5150247	And I literally walked into the vault and what's the first game I see?
5150407	5151168	Oh, Magician Lord.
5151368	5151668	Okay.
5152589	5153950	Which is a Neo Geo game.
5154771	5158914	It was developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK.
5159595	5163498	And it is a Neo Geo arcade in the home systems and a virtual console.
5163518	5164078	It came out in 1994.
5166491	5177833	So, this is a platform game, and it actually was one of the pack-ins for the Neo Geo AES, so that's probably why I have a copy.
5178373	5183794	But it's about this wizard named Elta, who is the last magician lord going to save his homeland.
5184894	5191035	And you go through and you get different spheres that will give you different abilities.
5191396	5193656	Excuse me.
5194560	5201993	He can jump and shoot and climb and do all kinds of stuff and he, you know, those fire and he cosplays every time he gets a sphere.
5202373	5204998	Well, okay, he actually gets different abilities with each sphere.
5206240	5207402	He also walks really funny.
5209109	5211950	And even if he walks fast, he still looks like he's prancing, kind of.
5212410	5217792	Like, it's just, like, he's climbing a ladder right now, but you just have to look at him walk.
5217872	5218052	See?
5218652	5221473	Well, he's in, never mind, he looks funny when he's in human form.
5221633	5225554	Anyway, so he got, has a dragon warrior form.
5225574	5231076	He breathes fire, and it's a continuous short-range attack, and you can aim it diagonally.
5231856	5238380	And then Waterman, where there's water grenades that are blue bubbles that explode into water pillars.
5239280	5242222	Which sounds kind of like Caterpillar, but not.
5243902	5246664	And then there's Poseidon, which is a more powerful Waterman.
5247064	5250606	So he shoots waves of water and has a lot of damage.
5250666	5254128	And he can freeze enemies and shatter on impact.
5254948	5256669	And moves very slowly.
5257443	5264233	The Shinobi is more agile and has powerful magic arcs of fire.
5264333	5265715	They are wide but slow moving.
5265835	5273265	There's the Samurai who can attack through barriers such as walls, shields, multiple enemies with a boomerang-like energy attack.
5273906	5281953	and then Raijin, who gives Elta the ability to jump a lot better and has an electrical field around his body.
5283334	5286776	I guess that's because Raijin is an electric person.
5287557	5288658	So that is the game.
5288738	5291140	I think that he just walks really funny.
5291880	5293181	Kind of prancy funny.
5293201	5293482	He does.
5293542	5294462	He prances a little bit.
5294522	5295063	It's kind of funny.
5295103	5297405	I like his stylish blue hat.
5298464	5300125	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5325205	5330269	Alright, we are going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't worry guys, we'll be right back with plenty more.
5330289	5334713	We're going to get to your phone calls tonight, of course, some rapid fire news, the mailbag, and all that good stuff we always do.
5335333	5340758	Also tonight, I've been keeping it a secret, I want to do a little something special for you guys that are listening tonight.
5341547	5342007	Orange Lounge Radio
5375646	5380510	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, June the 13th of 2010.
5381932	5391860	We've had a lot of busy, busy E3 pre-news tonight and lots of breaking news and updates going on and all this stuff happening and will the madness never end?
5392200	5392981	Of course not!
5394122	5395043	E3 Pre-News
5400743	5402684	I'm Tom Brokaw with a special report
5423658	5431041	Basically, it's Blizzard's own internal version of Steam slash X-Fire for their own games.
5431481	5437664	So you can see, like, if you have friends that play WoW on different servers, you're going to be able to talk to them on those different servers and interact with them and so forth.
5438064	5443606	But here's part of the catch that goes with that, is that you're going to have real names for friends.
5444127	5451870	Your real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing a character's profile.
5452410	5471948	real ID friends can also see who's on each other's real ID friends list making it easy for players to connect with other people they know I hate that I'm not going to use this I don't want people to know my full name I use a fake name here on the show I realize some people do but it's kind of one of those like you know I don't really like to advertise it I don't want to be found that easy
5472808	5499858	I can't imagine that they're going to force you to use your real name that there won't be some sort of option to use a fake name also maybe they'll go by what your account name whatever you put for that and I have used multiple accounts on WoW and I have used random names I think I had to use my real name I think I might have tried to put just my last initial and that's what I would like I don't care if it's my real last initial but I don't want somebody to google my name
5500698	5502141	and find all my WoW characters.
5502962	5504565	Especially with what I named some of them, okay?
5504605	5507710	I don't need my students at work doing that.
5507730	5508371	Sassy pants?
5508772	5509232	Sure!
5511636	5513620	So anyway, I don't know, I'm just...
5514252	5515333	It's kind of irritating.
5515353	5517195	It's kind of irritating.
5517215	5517755	It's kind of irritating.
5537685	5539986	I really hope that can be suppressed.
5540146	5542408	I hope Blizzard is not that stupid.
5542908	5546450	Blizzard, if you're listening, I hope you are not that stupid.
5546791	5549072	That'll make you pay $25 to change it.
5550773	5551674	Will I get a pony with it?
5552014	5552454	Probably.
5553135	5553515	Or a pet.
5554915	5556016	Alright, more breaking news.
5556216	5557998	Will there be more breaking news throughout the show?
5558118	5558438	I don't know.
5558458	5559099	It should have been a game.
5559119	5561220	Like, how many breaking news interruptions will there be tonight?
5561440	5562081	It's a crazy night.
5563022	5565444	Alright guys, let's get back into some gaming news.
5565464	5567045	We're going to do some quick stories here.
5567145	5569667	Loki and myself, Jamie's sitting out tonight because of her voice.
5569727	5571189	Loki, go ahead and let's get to some quick news.
5572530	5577176	Portal 2, just like the party that they were going to have for Portal 2.
5578157	5578798	It's been delayed.
5579739	5581161	Well, the party got canceled.
5581802	5582503	Game delayed, though.
5583064	5584205	Not coming out until 2011, and that's too bad.
5584225	5584385	Oh, well.
5588905	5597753	Game though that is coming out over here, also in 2011, which is kind of a surprise seeing as the last game hasn't sold very well at all.
5599634	5605519	Yakuza 4 is slated to be heading to North America and Europe in Spring 2011.
5606780	5610043	Hopefully they do not cut out a ton of stuff like they did with Yakuza 3.
5610083	5610123	So...
5613766	5621308	Final Fantasy 9 is making its way to PlayStation Network next week.
5623588	5626569	Personally, 9 was my least favorite on the PlayStation.
5626649	5629530	But hey, if you still want to buy it, it's only going to be $10.
5629590	5633611	Did you forget about Final Fantasy 8?
5634437	5635298	That's a great game.
5635678	5637620	A great game to make fun of.
5637720	5638981	I liked 8 better than 9.
5639262	5640343	Yeah, 9 is terrible.
5640363	5641684	What is wrong with you people?
5642705	5645688	Avivi was cool, and Quina was funny, and the game sucked.
5648137	5649698	I'm doing a show with insane people.
5669707	5671608	It doesn't say when it's supposed to end.
5671908	5673669	I'm guessing sometime next week.
5674689	5676030	I hope that's hours and not days.
5677030	5678611	I don't know.
5679672	5682493	Well, during E3 would kind of be the time to do it.
5682693	5684614	It's on the Japanese site.
5685315	5686155	It's interesting, though.
5686175	5687896	Maybe it's going to have online multiplayer.
5687956	5693179	Obviously, if they're doing a beta test, it's probably going to have online multiplayer because they have to stress their servers, but
5694625	5694965	I don't know.
5695346	5697467	Not really seeing anything on the countdown site.
5697527	5711538	But yeah, if you want to check it out, it's www.jp.playstation.com S-C-E-J slash Marusen M-A-R-U-S-E-N It's down to 86, so it must be ours.
5711899	5712799	Yes, it's ours.
5712899	5716022	So that would probably be sometime this week during E3.
5716942	5719064	Perhaps their press conference time?
5719324	5719584	Maybe?
5719725	5719945	Around?
5719965	5720465	I don't know.
5720845	5721466	About three days?
5721506	5721926	Yeah, maybe.
5722367	5722667	We'll see.
5723598	5725921	All right, moving on to some other news.
5726061	5726982	Puzzle Quest.
5727122	5728724	Yes, the news keeps coming on Puzzle Quest.
5729004	5729785	Actually, this is great.
5729845	5734210	Chapters 1 and 2 are free on the iPhone right now.
5734630	5737614	So if you want to grab a free Puzzle Quest, you got to do it right now.
5737974	5741097	I don't know how long this is available for, but I believe it's just the weekend.
5741137	5745102	So unfortunately, those of you listening to the podcast Monday morning, this sale may already be over.
5745442	5748965	But yeah, chapters 1 and 2 of Puzzle Quest, they split it up on the iPhone.
5749505	5750466	It's free right now.
5750867	5756331	Now if you actually get all the way to the third chapter, it's going to cost you $1.99 for the third chapter.
5757252	5758673	Is it going to hold your attention that long?
5758913	5760735	I got to the training dummy and then I stopped.
5761764	5766367	It's just, it's a little wonky on the iPhone because I did play that a little bit.
5766707	5772350	And my problem with it on the iPhone is that it's just that my 3G is not built to play a game like that.
5772491	5775973	It'll be better on that new iPhone 4 or whatever's coming out in a couple weeks.
5775993	5777994	I have a 3GS, so I'll see how it does on mine.
5778014	5779175	It'll probably do a little better with yours.
5779915	5780996	What did you think about the iPhone 4?
5782677	5783217	It looks amazing.
5783237	5785138	Do you really want to get in that discussion, Loki?
5785238	5785718	Yeah, sure.
5786799	5788099	I'm going to get one, absolutely.
5788899	5797483	I'm one of those people where my contract is up in October usually, so I get the whole retro deal or whatever from AT&T where I can't upgrade and it's coming out right in time for my birthday.
5797923	5799784	But I need a faster phone.
5799844	5804245	A lot of the apps are really hurting on the old phone and just for the technology to catch up.
5804285	5806226	I love the idea of a front-facing camera.
5806246	5807927	I think the video conferencing is going to be fun.
5808847	5810508	It'll be a fun little toy to have.
5810528	5811228	Yeah.
5811448	5814271	What did you think about the motion controllers or the new stuff?
5814291	5815232	With Gyroscope?
5815412	5816694	Yeah, we're going to get Lair on it.
5816834	5818636	I'm curious to see how it's going to be implemented.
5818976	5823381	But I'm a little worried, though, because I know I'm going to get these video phone calls from Miklatov.
5823682	5825043	And Miklatov's going to call me on video.
5825063	5827166	He's going to be like, look, my Pokemon evolved.
5827826	5828207	No, I want...
5828747	5831008	Unless it's adorable, will I do that?
5831068	5831829	He'll totally do it.
5831989	5833289	I'll only do it when I get black and white.
5833389	5835310	And video editing on live.
5835750	5837691	The HD camera thing is pretty cool.
5838131	5840152	I'm actually surprised you of all people asked this, Loki.
5841093	5842433	Are you interested in this photo?
5842453	5847936	No, I was watching the live blog because there was really nothing going on this week.
5848516	5851218	So it was kind of like my...
5853499	5858724	I guess preparation for the live blogs and conferences and stuff like that that are coming this week.
5859224	5860325	Kind of the prep course.
5861106	5861587	I'm sorry.
5862127	5865210	I just stopped listening to this show because Bobby sent me a link here on Twitter.
5865570	5866231	Another twit pic.
5866531	5869474	That is Itagaki in a space poncho.
5870134	5872637	I need a LiveJournal icon of this immediately.
5872877	5873998	DarkSakura, can you help?
5874639	5877361	It's Itagaki in the space poncho.
5877581	5878182	Send it to me.
5878562	5893964	Space Poncho Itagaki That's all you need I love it, he's kind of looking up like Behold, the future is in my poncho Oh, this is great I'm sorry, I'm having to distract Shane for a moment
5894437	5898560	Perhaps we can... I had to show him my favorite car ever.
5898660	5899761	Microsoft is genius.
5899781	5901963	They're getting all these celebrities to put on space ponchos.
5901983	5902303	Look at this.
5902323	5902603	Look at this.
5902643	5904044	Felicia Day in a space poncho.
5904084	5904504	There you go.
5904544	5905845	Send me the Itagaki.
5905885	5906866	I'll make you... I just did.
5906926	5908087	Check your private message.
5908147	5911529	I'm going to make one of him in the ponchos as space rock star.
5911589	5915973	Hey, you want to know something or kind of a funny game we should play?
5916433	5919795	How much will these space ponchos go for on eBay?
5920356	5921777	I hope they're covered in watermelon.
5924577	5928598	You know it's probably just going to be some sort of light showing or reflect off the space poncho.
5928618	5932199	They better, like, make you turn those in on the way out because they have another show tomorrow night.
5932440	5934320	We could have worn the space ponchos.
5934380	5936261	You know, if you don't go to work, we still can.
5936281	5937661	I would have laughed at you.
5938802	5940262	I would have been like, we could take this.
5940382	5940962	We could take this.
5941122	5942463	Ha ha ha ha ha.
5942583	5943023	Ha ha.
5943643	5946645	We could take emo pictures like the first few people that had them.
5947005	5948986	Ditch work or space poncho.
5949166	5951308	Ditch work or space poncho.
5952388	5954169	It's a tough call.
5954189	5955330	Those would be the same thing.
5955970	5957611	Work or space poncho.
5957651	5964475	The only way that this could possibly be cooler is if they had Conan O'Brien there and he just starts doing...
5965095	5965916	In the year 2000!
5966136	5969779	I guess that would be awesome.
5969959	5974443	I wonder if they're branded at all, and if they don't make you turn them in, they could probably go for a lot on eBay.
5974463	5976405	It's probably like the glasses after Captain EO.
5976425	5981449	There'll be a large man standing there making you deposit them in the bin, or he will ref you up.
5981549	5982050	What is that?
5982470	5983931	Captain EO at Disneyland?
5984292	5985793	Do you remember the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience thing?
5986233	5987194	That thing was weird.
5987234	5991958	Okay, imagine that with an 80s movie starring Michael Jackson.
5992058	5993499	It's the greatest motion picture ever made.
5993859	5995760	I can't believe that for a second.
5996721	5997342	It's coming back.
5997842	5998242	It's there.
5998543	5999483	I saw it a couple weeks ago.
5999583	6000044	It's amazing.
6001520	6004323	They brought it back after Michael Jackson kicked it.
6004984	6005164	Yes.
6006005	6007066	After he beat it?
6007627	6011691	After they realized that Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, wait, we haven't done that in a long time.
6011812	6017098	I have to say that the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was pretty fun because it had Eric Idle in it.
6018103	6029570	BobbyBlackWolf in our chatroom Bobby is pointing out Usually you can keep stuff from MS Press conferences I still have the ass cushion they gave us in 2007 It's in my garage What was that used for?
6029590	6041157	Well, I noticed 360 gives you hemorrhoids Well, if that's the same There was the one that was This 360 is so great, my anus is flaring
6041838	6048812	I went to the 360 dealie where they had us with the headphones.
6050035	6051939	And they didn't let us keep the headphones, but they were expensive.
6053666	6057268	Well, these are from the future, these space ponchos, so they might be expensive too.
6057388	6062211	So if I called in sick to work tomorrow, I might get in trouble and get a write-up, but I would get a space poncho.
6062451	6063452	It could be worth it.
6064392	6065273	But see, here's the sick thing.
6065433	6072057	Okay, I think I have a couple co-workers who listen to this show now, and the bad thing is I'm actually legitimately getting sick.
6072597	6075919	So if I do call in to work tomorrow, it's not for space poncho, it's because I'm sick.
6076240	6081143	But now they're going to go around telling people, oh, if you listen to Rob's show, he called in sick because he wants to go get a space poncho.
6082003	6082823	And then they'll understand.
6082843	6083624	I'm fucked either way.
6086845	6088406	No, actually, my coworkers are pretty cool.
6089186	6092128	They'd be like, as long as you wear it to work.
6092428	6097130	Most of my coworkers are like, you do a radio show?
6098170	6099711	I wonder if I could wear that to work.
6100451	6101492	A space poncho?
6101552	6102132	Yeah.
6102752	6104773	I've worn Santa hats before.
6104793	6106434	I can't see how that's any different.
6106894	6109956	You should just come back from LA and show up to work on your space poncho.
6109976	6117021	What you need to do is you need to go around E3 gathering parts to this grand costume that you will wear through E3.
6117181	6121744	Well, it's going to be mostly lanyards probably.
6122044	6123985	Lanyards and space ponchos.
6124005	6127888	BlackWolfInChat says, I've never heard that they're doing this event again though, but we have an invite.
6127908	6129729	Yeah, we have tickets for tomorrow.
6130049	6131050	Yeah, but we're just not going.
6131270	6132171	But now I kind of want to.
6132191	6134652	Let's go grab a space poncho and leave.
6135173	6135793	Ooh, that's a good idea.
6137740	6138240	I don't know what it is.
6138260	6140002	It's like a repeat for fans or something, right?
6140022	6143506	It was going to be a higher Cirque du Soleil and the blackout on TV is until Tuesday.
6143546	6144367	I think there's a reason for it.
6144387	6146089	They're probably doing fans tomorrow or something.
6146383	6155488	Yeah, it was something through, I guess, the campus that they're holding it on, and they were giving away tickets to the public, and we scored a couple.
6156429	6156889	That's cool.
6157289	6157850	Space poncho.
6158310	6158590	All right.
6159210	6162672	By the way, we were supposed to be doing news, and Black Wolf says, are you sure it's tomorrow?
6162772	6166935	Yes, a hundred times, because this is the same question Rob asked me.
6167555	6169656	Yeah, I put him through the whole interrogation too.
6169676	6172516	I'm like, okay, well, are you sure it's not Sunday?
6173377	6176938	But no, it's Monday at the same place, so it's not the press conference.
6176958	6180439	It's the same place, and it's called the Natal reveal or whatever.
6180559	6186560	And if it's not, I'm sure I would have gotten a text about it now saying, oh, crap, you guys, it's tonight, not tomorrow.
6187041	6187721	Yeah, exactly.
6188201	6191122	So I don't know what that's all about, but they're doing it.
6192782	6194283	Black Wolf's like, are you sure?
6194664	6195424	Yeah, I saw that.
6195905	6202049	I'm as sure as I can be without actually being there and seeing the tickets, but my contact, you know, I trust.
6202369	6205231	Nikolatov in a space poncho says, yes, it's true.
6205751	6206412	All right, anyway.
6207312	6208513	Are you sure you're positive?
6208573	6209794	Okay, come on, let's move on.
6210214	6211195	All right, other stuff.
6211235	6213116	Civilization V has a release date.
6213156	6213796	Yay!
6214197	6216979	September 21st is when Civ V is coming out in North America.
6217079	6221261	24th is when it will come out internationally, which means it will be pirated internationally on the 21st.
6223503	6226266	This is the civilization that has hexagons in it, basically.
6226306	6228068	There'll be more information at E3 next week.
6228108	6230951	You know I'm going to be checking this out because I loves me some civilization.
6232119	6235862	Alright, Duke Nukem Manhattan Project is real.
6235922	6238964	It's coming to Xbox Live for $10 on June 23rd.
6239004	6240585	A little trailer hit the internet this week.
6241225	6244087	And I believe, what, this is a 2D game, right?
6244167	6246129	So this is actually kind of retro graphics.
6246389	6249571	Yeah, it's 3D, but it's a 2D side-scroller action game.
6249591	6251893	It's kind of where the 2D games are going these days, right?
6251913	6255235	It's like a beat-em-up.
6255295	6257897	I'm going to get your match this time, Nukem World.
6258397	6260098	That's cool, but it's not Duke Nukem Forever.
6260759	6264081	That's still kind of neat, because if you remember, Duke Nukem's roots were a 2D game.
6264101	6265162	I think a lot of people forget that.
6265202	6266943	Duke Nukem was a 2D game first.
6267203	6268924	Where's my Halloween Harry remake?
6269645	6271346	It's a good day to die.
6273067	6274048	All right, good stuff.
6274068	6277430	You may remember, and since this isn't our show role, I'll talk about it.
6277610	6287797	You may remember there was a lawsuit filed against the people working on Duke Nukem Forever because they took too damn long, and that's been settled.
6288277	6290978	and perhaps Duke Nukem News in the future, maybe?
6292158	6292518	Don't know.
6292578	6296099	And actually... I don't know if we can get into that later.
6296319	6296620	Never mind.
6297260	6298780	Oh, no, no, no, we're not.
6298960	6303882	Actually, one other thing, kind of going back to when we were talking about Rock Band 3.
6305002	6315449	There was also, remember, a lawsuit against MTV Games and Harmonix for Rock Band from Gibson.
6315850	6319992	And that's been settled because you know who's making the Super Pro guitar controller?
6320593	6321113	Gibson.
6324557	6325677	Here's a random game.
6325798	6329139	Super Dimension Game Neptune apparently is a new game coming out.
6329179	6330520	It's a Japanese role-playing game.
6330880	6333861	It's about game consoles who transform into anime girls.
6334641	6335662	I am not making this up.
6336202	6340084	It stars such people as Purple Heart, Green Heart, White Heart, and Black Heart.
6340124	6341624	That's so imaginative.
6342304	6346626	They're going to fight Magikon, which I guess is the villain in the game.
6347046	6350428	It's basically like an R4 device type thing.
6350908	6353290	Well, it's Nippon Ichi who does Disgaea.
6353370	6354131	They are part of this.
6354171	6355392	So is Compile Heart.
6355752	6357174	They do Agarest Reward.
6358115	6359215	Lots of interesting things there.
6359516	6362719	Apparently, classic Sega characters are supposed to show up in the game.
6362819	6367803	Space Harrier, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd are like the summons in this game from the Nettoons.
6368083	6368564	That's awesome.
6368824	6369925	And apparently, here's the thing.
6370045	6370565	I'm getting this.
6370646	6373348	You can also use images from your PlayStation 3 photo library.
6373368	6373848	I'm getting this.
6373948	6376991	It's a PS3 exclusive, which means region-free, kids.
6377211	6377692	I'm getting this.
6378132	6378813	Sounds pretty awesome.
6378893	6381856	Wasn't the Neptune a codename for one of the Sega systems anyways?
6382797	6383618	That's kind of ironic.
6383658	6384378	I believe it was.
6385780	6389884	It was the Dreamcast's codename.
6392106	6393307	Marissa Congusto in chat.
6393327	6393868	Hi, Marissa.
6394268	6396571	Says Gibson, referring to the earlier story.
6396631	6399513	Gibson, does that mean it's going to be insanely expensive and elitist?
6400214	6400474	Yes.
6401335	6401556	Yes.
6402895	6404538	Big announcements out of one studio here locally, right?
6413221	6417263	Telltale Games has announced that they're going to be doing some more episodic games.
6418084	6422266	One franchise they are now going to be creating games for is Jurassic Park.
6422806	6434193	They have struck a deal with NBCUniversal to develop games based on the MediaGiant's properties and Michael Crichton's Dinosaurs in Modern Day franchise being the first to get the interactive treatment.
6435465	6441851	I wonder if since they've striked a deal with NBCUniversal, if we'll get an office game or something like that.
6442032	6444094	An episodic office thing?
6444174	6445775	I actually really like this music a lot.
6445955	6451521	I love the music in Jurassic Park, which is great because it's such a terrorist movie.
6451641	6455285	Not actually about terrorists, but those dinosaurs rip people in half.
6455605	6456506	And listen to the music.
6459963	6461223	Did you ever read the book?
6461724	6462064	I did.
6462304	6464305	Actually, believe it or not, I read the original Jurassic Park book.
6464325	6465285	Did you read The Lost World?
6465385	6467446	I did not read The Lost World, but I did see the movie.
6467526	6470387	Because I thought it was weird that he made a book sequel to a movie.
6470727	6472988	Because, like, different characters died in the original book.
6473008	6473188	Yeah.
6473488	6476389	Like, everybody died in the original book.
6476449	6479610	Like, my favorite character in the book died, and then he's suddenly back.
6480631	6482251	There's a six-month thing on spoilers.
6482271	6483392	After six months, it's okay.
6483412	6485752	Let's see, how long ago was that book written?
6485792	6486153	Like, in the 80s?
6486173	6486313	Yeah.
6489161	6492482	That's a very interesting franchise to bring back, don't you think?
6492502	6498344	I think they should do more movies, to be honest, because, granted, the third movie sucked, but, hey, we're past that now.
6498384	6501925	It's been countless number of years, well, not countless, but a lot of years.
6501965	6504286	Wasn't the fourth one kind of, like, held up in the works for a while?
6504426	6515510	But they should have, I mean, they had the whole thing where, oh, the ship, you know, was on autopilot and landed on the mainland or whatever, and there's dinosaurs in there, and maybe some of them escaped, and now they're breeding.
6515930	6518651	That would make an interesting story, you know, dinosaurs on the mainland.
6520249	6522751	Jurassic Park was actually kind of an awesome movie.
6522771	6531314	I remember when it first came out, a lot of people didn't like it, but kids our age at that time, which had been teenagers and stuff... I had my birthday party centered around it when it came out, and we didn't see it.
6532235	6533995	Let me tell you how long ago this movie came out.
6534015	6534596	You ready?
6535116	6537377	I went to the dollar movies with my girlfriend.
6537737	6539098	to see Jurassic Park.
6539218	6541299	And I had to hold her hand because she was so scared.
6541639	6547141	Remember when the dinosaur is looking through like that diner door thing at one of the little girls and he snorts?
6547241	6549222	He snorts like she screamed.
6549462	6550182	It was so funny.
6550202	6550543	Why?
6550603	6551743	Is she afraid of snorting?
6551763	6554464	Well, I think she's afraid of killer dinosaurs that will rip her in half.
6554784	6557305	Because remember the dinosaur like ate that guy in the toilet?
6557766	6558626	Sitting on the toilet.
6559006	6560567	Sitting on the toilet.
6560627	6560847	Rah!
6561328	6571203	another universal movie property that's going to get the game treatment as well and that's so awesome Back to the Future is getting some episodic games as well
6573308	6574408	That's kind of awesome, too.
6575109	6576389	What the hell, Telltale?
6576769	6578009	And I mean that in a good way.
6578790	6580810	Where the hell did this come from?
6582190	6593234	All them nerds at Telltale, and I say that in the most loving, endearing way, all them nerds at Telltale must have been sitting in the boardroom one day going, all right, what fucking nerdy, awesome things should we bring back?
6594034	6595674	And somebody was like, back to the future.
6595734	6596795	And somebody else said, fuck yeah.
6597335	6597835	And there it was.
6598895	6599935	Where's Day of the Tentacle?
6600516	6601716	We need more Day of the Tentacle.
6603089	6606731	Back to the Future, wasn't that actually a point-and-click game back in the day?
6606831	6609593	I seem to recall there was a LucasArts Back to the Future game.
6609813	6610694	I don't think so.
6610734	6612575	Would it have been LucasArts?
6613335	6618098	No, there was some side-scrolling games on the NES that really sucked.
6618659	6620240	Well, actually, the first one was alright.
6620500	6622461	The second one, Back to the Future 2 and 3, was terrible.
6625495	6627776	Well, Jurassic Park also had video games.
6627916	6629097	Jurassic Park games were awesome.
6629117	6630137	Yeah, they were really fun.
6630217	6632918	I thought the Super Nintendo one was scary as fuck.
6632938	6638121	I liked playing the arcade one where you sit in because I've several times found that machine on accidental replay.
6638141	6639301	I think that was fun.
6639361	6640862	All the Jurassic Park games are pretty awesome.
6640882	6642043	The arcade one was sweet.
6642103	6646925	The Super Nintendo one, which is kind of top-down, they went to almost a Wolfenstein mode.
6647325	6649846	And then the Genesis one where you play as a dinosaur.
6649866	6651127	Yeah, that was cool.
6652187	6679695	that was awesome I love the Super Nintendo one with that whole first person shooter thing and then like the dinosaurs would just jump out of nowhere like RARF although because the Super Nintendo's capability was so limited you had like this little tiny goggles thing on the screen to see it was it was kind of sad but it used surround sound it was one of the first games that had surround sound in it although I was too poor for that I thought it was awesome that it was surround sound on is it pro logic I guess because you know it only had stereo output
6679856	6681790	it was one of their old old old old ones
6682148	6695393	I don't know if it was simulated cue sound or whatever, but it was an old version of... It must have been Prologic, because that's the only... But obviously, now it's coming from Telltale, it's probably going to be more of a point-and-click game, so it'll be nothing like any of those games.
6695413	6700135	Actually, I do believe it was Prologic, because I remember running it through our receiver.
6702816	6703056	Good time.
6703076	6706017	And then the Back to the Future game, there's going to be a lot of love for that.
6706037	6707078	I'm pretty excited about that.
6707118	6710059	He told me last night, and he was looking pretty giddy.
6711178	6716184	Dude, you need to get Christopher Lloyd in and record a bunch of voice work because that guy is not getting any younger.
6717766	6718207	Good idea.
6718507	6720710	Same, you know, with Michael J. Fox, too.
6720790	6723694	Get him in there in the studio because he is not getting any younger.
6724707	6725727	I have some trivia for you.
6727128	6738550	We had, for a while, a Back to the Future pinball table, and if you look at it, Michael J. Fox's face is not on it because he would not lend his likeness to make the pinball table.
6738710	6739050	That's right.
6739070	6741071	It's like what happened with Paul Abdul in that American Idol game.
6741111	6743071	But you know who was supposed to play him before?
6743151	6744192	Wasn't it Jason Bateman?
6745112	6748213	No, it was Eric Roberts or something like that.
6748273	6748513	I forget.
6749173	6749533	I forget.
6750222	6752764	Yeah, no, Jason Bateman played the sequel, Teen Wolf.
6753045	6753405	Never mind.
6755126	6755527	Teen Wolf 2.
6756347	6758930	And Teen Wolf the TV series coming to MTV.
6760451	6760731	Awful.
6761132	6766837	Speaking of awesome sounding games coming out soon, there is a Spongebob Squarepants MMO.
6768078	6769119	Shoot me in the head.
6769299	6770360	No, it's awesome.
6770420	6771501	Here's my reply to that.
6775089	6777411	What do you have against Spongebob Squarepants?
6777611	6778011	All of you.
6778092	6779233	What is your problem with Spongebob Squarepants?
6779253	6779593	It's dumb.
6779693	6781574	I'm not interested in mental retardation.
6782555	6783436	I don't have a problem with it.
6783456	6784197	The show's okay.
6784637	6785478	It just grows on you.
6785598	6792704	When I flew to New York once, I watched Spongebob Squarepants the entire way, and it went a little something like this.
6796407	6798128	Aye, aye, Captain!
6798228	6799449	I can't hear you!
6799469	6799910	Aye, aye!
6814446	6821069	Spongebob Squarepants belongs to that whole time frame of Nickelodeon kid shows that were actually awful.
6822469	6823070	Shut your mouth.
6824190	6827251	It will be coming out in 2011, but here's the thing.
6827291	6831393	It's coming out for China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and India.
6832426	6837467	DarkSakura, what do you have for us since y'all are hatin' on Spongebob?
6855734	6858014	I have something cool, actually cool, kind of.
6859655	6868917	Street Fighter 4 might be having... Well, actually, there might be a motion-sensing Street Fighter game in the works.
6869037	6883240	It was actually Yoshinori Ono, who's the producer of Street Fighter 4, was saying that it could actually happen, that he was interested in motion-sensing ever since the Wii was launched, but he didn't think that Street Fighter...
6883880	6884640	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6906087	6911673	It's, I don't know, I'm worried it's going to be in that same bin as like, what was it, Virtual Street Fighter?
6911713	6912594	What was it, Street Fighter EX?
6912694	6913495	Was that what it was called?
6913775	6914496	Yeah, Street Fighter EX.
6914516	6915998	That really terrible Street Fighter game.
6916038	6917399	It was really bad, you guys.
6917880	6918380	Really bad.
6918400	6920322	I actually liked EX too.
6920783	6921163	Really?
6921604	6924587	Yeah, I actually, I managed to get it to run on a 486.
6924667	6924807	Wow.
6924847	6927851	The first EX, sorry.
6928942	6929682	That's old school.
6929902	6930942	We have breaking news, Rob.
6931803	6932303	Do we really?
6932423	6932583	Yes.
6932883	6934463	I keep closing the theme song, though.
6934483	6935003	I'm not ready.
6935123	6937364	You have to warn me when you're going to have breaking news.
6937384	6938404	I just did.
6939584	6940544	I gave you warnings.
6941565	6942185	A few seconds.
6943505	6943825	All right.
6943845	6944305	Well, hold on.
6944325	6947066	We got to wake up the orchestra and get them to warm up.
6947126	6947406	All right.
6947426	6948266	Here we go, guys.
6948346	6949126	Breaking news.
6949406	6950126	Breaking news.
6959332	6965798	Coming from a credible source, according to IGN, Retro Studios is creating a Donkey Kong title.
6965838	6970622	That's right, the folks behind Metroid Prime are making a Donkey Kong game.
6971423	6972324	That's gonna be weird.
6972944	6973345	Huh.
6973565	6975046	First person Donkey Kong.
6975807	6978269	Okay, that could be interesting.
6978289	6979951	I don't know how I feel about that.
6979971	6981532	Do we have to play it with the bongo drums?
6982313	6983374	There are no bongo drums.
6983734	6984615	Like Donkey Konga?
6985390	6985991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7009853	7013619	People start acting goofy when they're wearing space ponchos.
7013739	7014821	I think this is crazy.
7015562	7017546	I just heard that.
7017566	7019649	You should see the Donkey Kong game we're making.
7019669	7020370	What's up with that?
7020791	7022534	Pick an executive, take him out for drinks.
7023135	7023796	There you go.
7025495	7025835	XBOX Live
7045157	7049899	Arcade as digital downloads in celebration of the 11th anniversary of the Dreamcast.
7050199	7051859	I just think it's convenient timing if you ask me.
7053340	7057041	Apparently one of the first games coming out will be Sonic Adventure.
7057681	7061403	Also Crazy Taxi is confirmed to be coming as well.
7062923	7064364	Sonic Adventure I know is definitely out.
7064584	7065804	Crazy Taxi!
7065824	7068285	Because Sonic Adventure already leaked out.
7072878	7074279	We just need Jet Set and we're good.
7075800	7078641	And Phantasy Star Online, the first ones.
7079961	7080802	That would be kind of cool.
7081402	7084823	That would be actually really cool if Phantasy Star Online kind of came back, but on Xbox.
7085904	7087184	There's still private servers, Rob.
7087204	7088585	There's Phantasy Star Universe, too.
7088925	7091066	We don't talk about that terrible game.
7091426	7092626	It's not that bad.
7092726	7093267	It's awful.
7095325	7102351	Alright, every week we encourage you guys to send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read a few of them here live on air.
7102451	7102731	Why?
7102771	7104292	Because we can, and we love you.
7107695	7113380	Now usually DarkSakura dives in and reads the emails, but because she's under doctor's orders tonight, she's not going to read the emails.
7113720	7114180	I am!
7116662	7123388	Alright, but DarkSakura can feel free to comment, but she won't be criticizing spelling and grammar, sadly, because she can't.
7124148	7129511	Alright, and plus I don't have good spelling and grammar, so I wouldn't be able to criticize you anyway.
7129931	7130892	Let's get to the first email.
7130952	7134794	First email from our good pal, friend, buddy, RubbaBubbaBubba.
7135414	7139777	RubbaBubba is emailing us because he wants to tell us about Season 2 of The Tester.
7140577	7143379	Now, I realize a lot of people gave The Tester shit.
7144077	7145859	and somewhat rightfully so.
7146400	7150023	But it wasn't as terrible as I think some people made it out to be.
7150063	7152425	I think a lot of people who really criticized it didn't watch it.
7152526	7154307	It wasn't the worst reality show I've ever seen.
7154668	7158011	I mean, didn't one of those chicks on The Real Housewives get a spinoff show?
7159352	7160213	I think a few of them.
7160233	7162114	And you're going to hate the tester when there's that?
7162234	7162915	I mean, just saying.
7163435	7168739	So anyway, he wanted to write us to say, there is a casting call about to begin for season two of The Tester.
7168759	7175184	The prize this year seems to be a one-year contract with Sony and a $10,000 cash prize.
7176525	7177686	Hey Miklatov, I found you a new job.
7179117	7179817	Yeah, right.
7180138	7181478	You've always wanted to be on a reality show, right?
7181498	7182338	You could do this.
7182358	7183259	I'm just Survivor.
7183579	7187720	www.thetester.com Well, this is kind of like Survivor, but not really.
7187881	7192042	No, but I know what being a tester is like, and I would not do that again.
7192322	7193123	You just get the $10,000 prize and quit.
7194841	7195941	I don't know, you're in a contract.
7195961	7196942	I guess that's true, huh?
7197402	7199882	Maybe I could be really bad so they could break me of my contract.
7200442	7211105	He also links us to a demonstration of the casting call at playstation-staging.gotcast.com You want to read the rules and all that stuff and get a video ready.
7211245	7212685	I believe they're due any day now.
7213165	7219807	I'd like to see someone from OLR or even All Games kind of get in on this so I have someone to root for but I won't hold my breath.
7219827	7221407	I think it might be fun though.
7222884	7224445	Come on, those of you that are on Fun Employment.
7224465	7226046	I could try, I guess, but I don't want to be a tester.
7226066	7226647	Think about it.
7227267	7227987	Reality show.
7229308	7235472	It's so much fun to play the same... I don't think Nelly would be supportive of you leaving her with the new baby for a few weeks to go film this tester show.
7235492	7236133	That'd be dumb, yeah.
7236193	7241396	Nobody seems to understand that you played, like, the same stage over and over again for eight hours a day for, like, a month.
7241937	7244899	And you have to listen to the same song when you're doing steps for, like, a month.
7244919	7246120	If it's a good song, it's okay.
7246140	7247601	So it's like playing Earth Defense Force.
7247921	7249002	I still haven't played that.
7249922	7250923	I know, I'm missing out.
7251505	7255912	Another email in our mailbag at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com from Shook.
7256513	7258335	And Shook writes us, Hi, OLR.
7258916	7265887	I would personally like to thank DarkSakura for encouraging me to go back and replay good old Metal Gear Solid for the billionth time.
7267936	7269197	Oh, it's a listener sucking up.
7270937	7271378	Just kidding.
7271578	7272518	That's inappropriate.
7272818	7276360	Alright, thanks to PS1 Classics.
7276420	7279141	I downloaded it and fell in love with it all over again.
7279541	7280922	Now I'm going to replay the others too.
7281022	7283743	Thank you for the excellent Game of the Week bit from Shook.
7284243	7285064	Good job, DarkSakura.
7285344	7287325	A pat on the back and a cookie for DarkSakura.
7287965	7288345	There you go.
7288385	7292647	But it'll have to be like, I don't know, like a herb cookie or something because she's on the natural thing.
7293287	7294188	You can get raw cookies.
7294864	7295224	What's that?
7295344	7296325	You can get raw cookies.
7297325	7299005	And keep in mind, I'm 70% raw.
7300686	7302066	Alright, let's see.
7302166	7304887	Also, going to an email from Damani125.
7304927	7306308	This is our last email tonight, folks.
7306388	7308188	Oh, this is going to be a great one, Miklatov.
7308989	7312030	Hey, OLR, I'm finally sending this email because I got a droid now.
7312250	7315091	Also, now I can listen to your live stream by means of a free app.
7315151	7315431	Yay!
7316010	7316871	Droid Diction Oblivion 5 Elder Scrolls 5
7338788	7340569	And why are you barfing over there, Miklatov?
7341590	7342691	We had this discussion.
7343091	7344312	Yes, but we didn't have it on the air.
7344392	7345933	Okay, let's have it real quick.
7347093	7355478	So, if you play, and if they have it there, Elder Scrolls V, I said that I will throw up because I hate the Elder Scrolls games.
7355558	7355879	Why?
7355979	7356459	They're great.
7356499	7356739	Great!
7356759	7357319	They're boring.
7357339	7359560	They're some of the best games to ever come out for the season.
7359580	7359660	Nope.
7359720	7360460	You are an idiot.
7360480	7361301	Not even close.
7361481	7363581	I would rather... Okay, this is what happened.
7363962	7367063	When Morrowind came out, everybody was like, oh, it's the best game ever.
7367083	7369684	I was like, okay, it's got to be awesome.
7369824	7370844	Everybody says so.
7371244	7373085	I went to Blockbuster and I rented it.
7373585	7377206	I returned it, oh, like an hour later.
7377646	7379347	And they're like, oh, you can just get another game.
7379947	7382288	So I got Unlimited Saga.
7382708	7409315	and then I returned it like 20 minutes later and I just didn't care after that because both of those games were awful but my point is Elder Scrolls is so boring I guess it's because I don't like the fact that you have like the main story and you can do whatever you want that's cool but it feels a little bit too much like you can do whatever you want so who cares about the main story
7409835	7411737	Why don't I just go kill this entire town?
7411837	7414659	Or I'll go be a vampire or something like that.
7416101	7416801	I just don't like them.
7418303	7423788	I do want to give Fallout a try though, but I don't want to ever play an Elder Scrolls game again.
7424381	7430310	So apparently this whole time, Bobby has been leading an effort to get Space Poncho to trend on Twitter.
7430791	7435898	And he actually got some of the former Gamerscore blog people to start using Space Poncho.
7435918	7439083	All these people are now using the term Space Poncho on Twitter.
7439103	7439684	That's awesome.
7442557	7443718	We have to go get one tomorrow.
7444298	7445318	I officially endorse this.
7445378	7450441	If you have a Twitter, you need to make a post right now about Space Poncho with a little tweet thing.
7450621	7451902	Oh, four new tweets just popped up.
7451942	7452342	Look at that.
7452562	7458285	And now to make the full circle, we need a picture of President Cat wearing a Space Poncho.
7460206	7462167	Oh, good question from Salacious Pop in chat.
7462367	7463847	Do you like other sandbox games?
7463987	7464928	Give me examples.
7465528	7467189	Grand Theft Auto 4, Red Dead Redemption.
7467549	7472672	No, but my dislike for Red Dead Redemption is because I don't really like the old west.
7473072	7476013	So the setting just wasn't... So you just don't like sandbox games.
7476474	7477554	You want your games to be linear.
7477974	7485498	Yeah, which might be why I like Final Fantasy XIII so much because I go forward and I can just attack enemies and I don't have to do much else.
7485778	7487299	All right, let me go back to Damani's email here.
7487839	7492665	Now, I've never played Oblivion 4 until after I played Fallout 3, but I still am really far into the game.
7492905	7497230	I was wondering if they'll ever make a fifth Oblivion, because it seems like they're focusing more on Fallout games now.
7497750	7501054	Now, I do like Fallout more than Oblivion, but it seems like... By the way, do you like Fallout?
7501610	7502291	I haven't played it yet.
7502591	7505933	I avoided it because people compared it to Elder Scrolls games.
7505953	7507074	It's basically Elder Scrolls with guns.
7507395	7509476	Which might be better.
7511157	7512979	There's less people that really have wanted to do a fifth one.
7513259	7516982	It just seems like no one ever talks about Oblivion so Bethesda doesn't see it selling that good.
7517382	7519204	No, I think you might be wrong, buddy.
7519384	7521265	I think it did sell very well.
7521285	7525569	I just think those games take years and years to develop.
7525929	7528131	There was a rumor about an MMO based on Oblivion.
7528151	7529452	Yeah, that came out in court documents.
7530132	7534977	Anyway, that's why I think it's not happening for a while, and I was just wondering how much you wanted the fifth one.
7535157	7535958	I want it very badly.
7536418	7537099	Oh, and one last thing.
7537139	7543765	I signed up for the Oil Army in the big battle at all games, and I think we need a battle cry, a battle hymn or song, and a slogan.
7544105	7546688	Now, a slogan would be like, Fight for Farity Justice.
7547148	7575935	a battle cry could be like for the ferret those are just examples I'm not sure what to do for the song well time for me to be hitting the old dusty trail I hope we get more people for the battle I'll be serving a tour of duty for OLR and Battlefield Bad Company 2 thank god I'm glad somebody's representing us in that because I don't own that game thank god hats off to you and I hope more people sign up for the Battlefield Bad Company 2 thing on the 26th I don't know do we have a battle cry that we could have we need to think about that chatters I put that to you too what should the battle cry be for the OLR army in the big battle
7576435	7597764	and please remember guys for the horde please remember guys remember the number one rule of the oil army when you do participate in this event don't be a dick we like all these guys that are participating in it so don't be a dick it's just a fun thing it's a fun stupid it's like the olympics it promotes peace and harmony and a little bit of spirited competition that's what it's all about it's the olympics of video games
7598824	7600064	But only all games is invited.
7601105	7601385	All right.
7603045	7603305	Let's see.
7603385	7607307	Oh, Reject False Icons is possibly a battle cry that's being suggested.
7607327	7607787	That's a good one.
7607887	7609207	I like that from SJ100Matt.
7610488	7610748	All right.
7611008	7611788	That was it for the mailbag.
7611828	7615169	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you would like to contribute more in the future.
7615229	7617130	For now, we're going to get a little bit angsty.
7617250	7617770	Grr.
7618070	7618270	Arrgh.
7633430	7633970	DarkSakura.
7635051	7636672	Um, F you to not having a voice.
7638053	7638374	Loki!
7640075	7644098	Um, F you to people on eBay to demand more money after an auction closes.
7644258	7645979	That's not how eBay works, stupid.
7647420	7650703	F you to the fact that I'm getting sick the day before E3.
7652504	7652884	Damn it.
7653845	7654806	Niklatov?
7655590	7681538	FU to Roseville Golf Land for their crappy taking care of their beautiful Technica machine and for their 16 year old employees that are gone well that was a lot of angst tonight I think you guys did a very good job with your angst tonight we are going to get back into some gaming news but for some reason I forgot to put on our little list of things we're going to do tonight the Twitter topics we don't want to ignore Twitter so here we go we're going to go to Twitter topics right now
7687034	7689056	Gears of War Art Director Makes an Unreal Movie Pitch
7713633	7715374	I'd heard about this just before tonight's show.
7715394	7718236	Apparently, the Mortal Kombat wasn't the only movie pitch to happen this week.
7718637	7732406	Jerry O'Flaherty, which is our director for the original Gears of War, he apparently has done a pitch for a film called Samurai, but I guess it's based off Unreal, and you can actually look at a little clip right here, which there's one on the internet.
7733887	7734928	You know, it's all artsy.
7735549	7738791	It's kind of got that comic book-y look like 300 had a little bit.
7739772	7740272	That could be cool.
7741553	7746362	I don't know though, haven't movies based on video games really not done well?
7746382	7748606	Like Prince of Persia did not do as well as they thought, huh?
7750510	7751111	That's kind of sad.
7752575	7756259	Ray Ayanami sent us a link here about Arcade Infinity closing down.
7757040	7759622	No, not before I can go play Technica.
7759722	7761284	Why is everybody against me?
7761304	7763666	This apparently, well, I don't think it's happened yet.
7764407	7772695	But this is an extensive story that's coming from a website, Shoryuken.com, that I guess is talking about the possibility about Arcade Infinity closing down.
7772755	7773936	I don't know what's going on.
7773956	7775377	Just another week and then I don't care.
7776418	7781124	I guess I'm heartless Japan still has a lot of games to develop
7794759	7798461	Interesting, but it doesn't say anything about whether for sure this arcade is shutting down or not.
7798481	7800723	That's the part that's kind of like getting me here.
7800783	7803624	But I guess, I don't know, it kind of said here near the end.
7803664	7804605	I can't read this whole story.
7804665	7806006	It's like a feature here.
7806426	7811389	But they do intend to keep the arcade open strictly for the same reason he goes to work, the people.
7811809	7813550	He knows most of the people out there are like a friend.
7813591	7816412	The arcade to me is a business, but the people out there are now my friends.
7816452	7817913	I get excited for the games that are played.
7818614	7820755	So he doesn't say it's closing yet.
7821135	7825598	That mentality closed all of the arcades back in Wichita.
7826258	7826558	Wow.
7826739	7827499	It was kind of sad.
7827839	7829020	I hope they don't actually close.
7829040	7829620	That would be sad.
7831301	7831962	Let's see.
7833203	7834303	TigerClaw sent us another link.
7834323	7835784	I'll let him have two tweets tonight because I'm nice.
7836445	7840567	Capcom will add Playboy advertising in Dead Rising 2 apparently is one of the big things.
7840587	7845630	Yes, there are magazines and actual magazine pictures on the wall and then actual magazines you can pick up that are Playboy.
7846171	7848993	But this whole inserting
7849873	7853699	Product placement or what have you in video games is kind of starting to become more and more of a trend.
7853759	7856743	Yet another way to make money off of games besides the $10 thing.
7856843	7861670	We saw Alan Wake this morning had the sync for the cars.
7862892	7865796	I don't know exactly what it's called beyond sync, but that was in there.
7866737	7871819	So now the Playboy Bunny will show it up in the game along with some sexy ladies on the cover of the magazines.
7871859	7872199	There you go.
7872239	7872959	She's not wearing a bra.
7873199	7873980	You know that, Miklatov?
7874200	7875080	She has no bra on.
7875100	7876020	I have bad eyes.
7876100	7876700	I can't tell.
7877141	7877841	I was just letting you know.
7877861	7880042	She's going to have saggy boobs when she's old.
7882622	7883603	Because she's not wearing a bra?
7884823	7886644	That's why women wear a bra.
7887244	7888945	Well, we don't want to know her when she's old.
7889045	7890005	We just want to know her now.
7892208	7895549	Ray Iannami wants to send us this too about a story about Death Smiles.
7895589	7897950	Apparently it's getting a US localization.
7898410	7900591	It's going to be coming out later this June by Axis.
7900951	7902432	It was originally developed by Cave.
7902872	7906733	They did Don Donpachi, Espegluta, and all these fun games.
7907433	7909074	Yeah, there's going to be a localization.
7909094	7909954	The game is in English.
7910034	7911315	Hooray, Death Smiles.
7911415	7915636	It's coming out in a limited edition set with a faceplate and soundtrack.
7917702	7917943	Nice.
7919405	7919705	All right.
7919946	7921589	That's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.
7921629	7924614	Again, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.
7924634	7928760	Show us your tweets a little bit like the ladies in the Playboy magazine like to do.
7929679	7931721	All right, let's get back into some news, Loki.
7960022	7963503	Honestly, before this lawsuit, I did not know there was an active.com.
7963583	7973426	So we'll have to see what happens or what that's going to do with EA Sports Active 2, which will be out this fall.
7976347	7976667	I don't know.
7977428	7978048	Sounds stupid.
7981949	7982629	More lawsuits.
7982709	7983410	This is America.
7983750	7984490	God bless America.
7984821	7995065	Actdeft.com wants some money sorry I was a little bit of dead air there I was looking at Space Poncho tweets on Twitter because apparently somebody actually made a Twitter account called Space Poncho now how long did that take like five seconds
7996033	7998215	A++ to whatever All Games Listener did that.
7998255	8000177	If it wasn't All Games Listener, it might have been somebody, I don't know.
8000317	8002218	Some other people are having fun with that little title now, too.
8002879	8003159	All right.
8004020	8004400	Oh, boy.
8004500	8010805	This game, I saw this actually originally on an Oh No They Didn't post earlier this week, but it also hit Destructoid.
8010846	8015690	It's apparently a game called Hey Baby, and I'm not talking about the No Doubt song.
8015730	8019213	No, this is a game called Hey Baby where you play a woman
8019833	8023077	who gets aggressively catcalled by men.
8023538	8028164	They will say, hey baby, nice ass, or hey, I wanna fuck you, or whatever they're gonna say.
8028805	8034192	And in this game, you take your aggressions out on these men by killing them.
8034813	8036495	And then when you kill them, they turn into tombstones.
8036635	8037476	That sounds like fun.
8038277	8042858	It's, um, it looked pretty awful, I gotta say, actually, from the little trailer I saw.
8043278	8050060	I think the comment I posted on OhNoTheyDidn't when I saw the little graphics, I was like, I think Hexen in 1996 had better graphics than this game.
8050740	8052840	There's actually a little trailer here we can actually look at here.
8052860	8054420	There's a thing on Twitter here.
8056441	8057901	It's payback time, boys!
8057921	8058581	Look at the graphics.
8060722	8061762	The graphics are terrible.
8063762	8065483	I wanna see if we can get some of the, uh...
8073748	8076349	One of those guys said, God bless you, and you're going to shoot him?
8076750	8077950	That was a nice thing to say.
8077970	8080031	Maybe you're only supposed to shoot the bad people.
8080051	8081611	Some women are dopes.
8081812	8082832	Not all, just some.
8082892	8085493	But somebody saying, God bless you, that's not hitting on you.
8085533	8088314	You're probably ugly if you think that's the case, okay?
8093416	8095357	And then you shoot them and they turn into one-two stones.
8096761	8125420	and the tombstones say such awesome things as I love you and you should leave your man and come with me and wow you're so beautiful this game looks stupid and yep she shot the guy and said god bless you here's a flamethrower instead don't play this game this looks stupid like I'm all for like woman power and stuff but play Metroid it sounded like it would be fun for just a little waste of time as a flash game but that looked really dumb
8133712	8134273	That's funny.
8135535	8136336	What, the game?
8136596	8136897	Yeah.
8136917	8138098	It just looks terrible.
8139040	8139941	It is terrible.
8139981	8140422	I mean, I get it.
8140482	8142264	It's a nice concept for a game.
8142344	8145389	It's funny, but it's just executed terribly.
8147078	8156625	Alright, we're going to get into another part of the show here that, gosh, we have not done this in a very, very, very, very, very long time.
8157106	8158427	But I'm excited tonight.
8158467	8162890	We're going to bring back the Orange Lounge Radio match game.
8162950	8163450	Yes, that's right.
8163470	8167073	Video game match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8177365	8182152	By the way, some breaking news, and I'm not going to play the theme, but apparently the space ponchos just lit up green.
8184194	8186197	Why are we not going to this tomorrow?
8187399	8188000	I have to work.
8188040	8188440	I'm sorry.
8189021	8190944	I'm telling you, they're going to do the year 2000 thing.
8193702	8194023	All right.
8195364	8196325	Okay, let's get into the match game.

8278849	8279990	Is there anything you're really looking forward to?
8280825	8281605	Space ponchos.
8284126	8285047	They're demanding it.
8285087	8286307	We have to get them.
8286447	8287508	I can't go.
8287908	8289429	Cough a little more.
8289449	8290249	Sounds sicker.
8291630	8291970	All right.
8292710	8295091	Do I count these people that are saying ponchos in space?
8295231	8295511	I don't know.
8295531	8295811	All right.
8296171	8296792	We'll count them.
8297052	8301073	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
8301994	8302834	Ten people want to play.
8302874	8304195	Pick a number between one and ten.
8305115	8305455	Who, me?
8305575	8306376	Miklatov, yes.

8311718	8313799	1, 2, 3, 4.
8312118	8313799	Ziba is going to get to play tonight.
8313859	8316900	Let's go to Ziba and say congrats.
8318060	8319641	You are playing...
8321838	8323479	Stand by.
8323939	8328282	Okay, so whether you like it or not, we're playing against Ziba.
8328742	8330864	Alright, any, oops, wrong music.
8331004	8332365	Hello, match game theme, hello.
8332425	8333966	It's been a little while since we've done match game here.
8334006	8335767	It's a little bit rusty here at Orange Laundry Studios.
8336487	8340850	Ryan, do you have any words of discouragement for Ziba tonight, your opponent?
8341731	8342111	I win.
8344192	8345213	Alright, let's see what happens.
8345233	8346033	Can't argue that.
8346193	8347654	Alright, let me explain.
8348035	8349716	Let me explain how the match game works.
8350899	8351219	DarkSakura.com
8378117	8378657	Just for tonight.
8379097	8380819	The one and only Techmaster Loki.
8381319	8381699	Hello.
8382580	8384641	And, of course, the biggest celebrity of them all, me.
8385582	8385982	Just kidding.
8386623	8388884	And the one and only Miglatov.
8389024	8390065	I don't know what else to call him.
8391086	8393627	DJ Max Technica not playing Miglatov.
8393647	8395389	Because Arcade Infinity is going to close.
8395429	8398811	And then on the drive back up, Sunnyvale is going to burn down or something.
8398891	8400272	And I just can't win.
8402677	8403438	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8421314	8424035	So all our followers on Twitter will get to see whatever you want to plug.
8424496	8425976	Okay, and you can plug it here on the show as well.
8426016	8427397	That's a fabulous prize, is it not?
8427897	8429218	Alright, here we go.
8429758	8430458	Number one.
8431299	8431999	Question number one.
8432059	8432439	Here it is.
8433760	8439803	Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight.
8441444	8443805	Leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.
8445151	8463868	This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing Let me read that one more time
8465037	8472622	Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.
8473082	8477325	This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing.
8481688	8481948	Ding.
8483089	8483589	Ryan is in.
8483629	8484570	Ding for me, too.
8484830	8485310	Ding.
8485670	8486251	Loki's in.
8486411	8486731	Ding.
8487411	8488812	DarkSakura has given the thumbs up.
8488852	8490113	That's the equivalent of a ding.
8490133	8492835	I'm just waiting on Ziba to send me a private message.
8494440	8494920	So we'll see.
8494940	8498382	As soon as Ziba sends me a private message there in chat, we'll be good to go.
8499922	8504164	Now, of course, if any of our folks are struggling, they can always read chat here.
8505184	8507605	Need and... Okay, there we go.
8507625	8508485	We got an answer from Ziba.
8508826	8509146	All right.
8509746	8510126	Here we go.
8510206	8511186	Question number one tonight.
8511487	8516949	Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.
8517389	8521610	This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing.
8522071	8523091	X-Link, what is your answer?
8523726	8546387	Space ponchos Space ponchos they will be showing What a surprise that that answer came up Alright, Ziba says They don't want people finding out about all the Games they will be showing What a serious answer Which means she's not gonna win It's like the poor person on the show That gets booed No, don't boo, it's a good answer If it was a real game show
8547489	8547769	That's all.
8547810	8548350	You never know.
8548971	8549571	You never know.
8549992	8551534	Maybe DarkSakura's like, I'm sick.
8551614	8553556	I don't want to write funny answers tonight.
8553876	8559302	DarkSakura, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the... Watermelon smashing.
8559563	8561685	Watermelon smashing they'll be showing.
8561745	8564268	Unfortunately, that is not a match with Space Poncho.
8565228	8571190	Loki, they don't want people to find out about all the... Survey says space ponchos.
8571210	8572650	Space ponchos!
8572710	8574330	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
8574430	8576131	Ryan gets a match.
8576231	8578091	Congratulations, Ryan.
8578111	8580872	It's one, Ziba, none.
8580932	8581612	That's okay, Ziba.
8581632	8582773	There's four questions tonight.
8582813	8584153	You have a chance.
8584193	8585413	Ziba just sent me a cry.
8585573	8586754	Emote icon, don't cry.
8586814	8587574	It was a good answer.
8588868	8589568	Good thing there's no money
8606019	8606640	Half point.
8607481	8609283	I give a half point too.
8609343	8610724	Half point?
8610905	8614068	I actually think ports are games, so I say games.
8614148	8615189	Alright, I'm outvoted.
8615209	8617051	A half point for Ziba on that one.
8617211	8618553	And judges' rules are final.
8619274	8620715	This isn't real TV.
8621095	8621336	Alright.
8623739	8624699	This is my answer.
8624739	8631765	This is because they don't want people to find out about all the Bukkake-covered space ponchos they will be showing.
8632345	8633066	Oh, there you go.
8633106	8633886	That's the surprise.
8633927	8635948	That's why they have to wear the splash zone there.
8636789	8638350	Is that a match with space ponchos, though?
8638770	8641232	He didn't say Bukkake-covered, and I think that part is important.
8641733	8644475	Could be a half point because the other half is Bukkake.
8644495	8645475	I don't know.
8645495	8646036	What do you guys think?
8646076	8648398	A half point for X-Link for Bukkake-covered space ponchos?
8648438	8649979	He does say space ponchos, though.
8651296	8665271	What they're covered with, we don't know Alright, so a half point for X-Link So it's one and a half to a half There you go There it is, question number one, right there How about question number two, you feeling good so far?
8665651	8666893	X-Link, you have a one point lead
8668084	8669024	I'm always feeling good.
8669044	8669885	What are you talking about?
8669925	8673106	And we made your opponent cry tonight.
8674906	8677367	I always make my opponents cry, so that's nothing.
8678228	8679348	Alright, be nice.
8680308	8680708	Here we go.
8681589	8682729	Question number two.
8683829	8684590	Did you hear?
8686110	8687291	You guys are supposed to go, what?
8688631	8689251	Let's try it again.
8689651	8690392	Did you hear?
8692292	8697234	The Mortal Kombat movie franchise might be coming back if one director gets his way.
8698376	8698496	Ding.
8698576	8698736	Ding.
8698776	8699016	Ding.
8699056	8699197	Ding.
8724859	8743338	X-Link, did you hear the Mortal Kombat movie franchise might be coming back if one director gets his way?
8743678	8748303	The reboot might be pretty cool, but the cast of Orange Ones Radio really hopes the director doesn't forget to have...
8749551	8778352	Dinosaurs Dinosaurs in the movie Cause dinosaurs and Mortal Kombat Have so much in common Alright It is Primal Rage Oh that would be an awesome movie Zeba says The cast of Orange Lounge Radio really hopes The director doesn't forget to have Spongebob in the movie Because Fatalities right Now that was a better answer Dinosaurs Okay
8778789	8781954	Alright, let's start with DarkSakura.
8782715	8788264	The cast of Orange Lounge Radio really hopes the director of the new Mortal Kombat movie doesn't forget to have... Cher playing Sindel.
8789146	8792391	Cher playing Sindel, the chick with the gray hair.
8793064	8793885	Cher, okay.
8793905	8794725	Could you imagine Cher?
8794906	8795766	I could with her voice.
8795806	8796947	She could sing and it would be like that.
8798308	8799289	That whole little thing.
8799349	8803132	I was watching Kathy Griffin earlier today and I love her impression of Cher.
8803612	8804373	You crazy bitch.
8805014	8807115	Alright, not a match though.
8807215	8807596	Not a match.
8807616	8807956	There you go.
8808957	8809357	Let's see.
8811739	8813440	Loki, did you hear?
8814981	8815282	Yes.
8815902	8819125	They're gonna have space punchalities in the game.
8821027	8821888	It's going to be crazy.
8822288	8824049	Space Ponchalities.
8824210	8826131	Good answer, but not a match.
8826872	8828133	Space Ponchalities.
8828613	8834377	Mikhotov, we really hope the director does not forget to have... Stryker.
8835078	8837020	Stryker in the movie.
8837460	8838281	Why Stryker?
8838301	8839501	Because everybody hates him.
8841519	8843760	X-Link, where the hell did the dinosaur answer come from?
8843780	8847161	Are you thinking about Mortal Kombat 2 where you could do the animalities?
8860848	8863910	I was just thinking Jurassic Park and Mortal Kombat.
8863970	8864411	Why not?
8864451	8866833	I mean, you have to have something worth fighting.
8867073	8867593	Why not?
8868154	8868534	Why not?
8868554	8870435	All right, let's go to the scoreboard.
8870676	8871937	Ryan is still leading.
8872237	8873218	I keep calling you by your real name.
8873238	8873698	I hope you don't mind.
8874038	8878722	Ryan is leading with one and a half points to Ziba's half point, but it's still anybody's game.
8880049	8881629	Yes, it's still anybody's game.
8882210	8883490	Miklatov's just putting it together.
8883610	8884670	Oh, I play WoW with that guy.
8885010	8885710	Alright, here we go.
8887591	8888751	Alright, here we go.
8889811	8890852	Question number three.
8891652	8892412	Oh, let me play the music.
8894733	8899774	We are so sad, so sad that Portal 2 got delayed until 2011.
8901519	8929450	but in an exclusive statement to Orange Lounge Radio Valve said we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add blank into the game ding ding ding ding ding
8933226	8935788	We are so sad that Portal 2 got delayed until 2011.
8935848	8937989	An exclusive statement to Orange Lounge Radio.
8938670	8944034	Valve said we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add blank into the game.
8945935	8947976	We are waiting for Ziba to lock in an answer.
8950678	8951299	Oh, she just did.
8951339	8951659	There it is.
8951719	8952019	All right.
8953881	8954841	All right, X-Link.
8955482	8956182	We need an answer.
8956242	8959725	We had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add...
8961167	8964250	Space Ponchos into the game.
8964370	8968954	I want to point out, these questions were written like two hours before tonight's show, okay?
8969014	8971056	So we had no... I'm just saying.
8971837	8973978	This was pre-Space Poncho era.
8974018	8974419	That's right.
8974859	8975220	All right.
8975620	8982726	Ziba says, we forgot to add bouncing balls into the game.
8983927	8985569	Were there bouncing balls in Portal?
8985749	8985829	No.
8986345	8994948	DarkSakura, we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add... Unsaturated polyester resin, fiberglass surface resins, and volatile malted milk impoundments.
9015156	9015397	What?
9015497	9016438	It's part of the cake recipe.
9018739	9020261	You're dumb, but I love you.
9020281	9021762	When you find the cake.
9021922	9022503	No, I know.
9022523	9023183	The cake sphere.
9023423	9024104	That's part of the recipe.
9024124	9027787	That and, you know, fish shaped, you know, methyl something.
9028308	9028668	I get it.
9028708	9029168	Nerd joke.
9029208	9029549	It's funny.
9029689	9030009	It's funny.
9030129	9030589	You did a good job.
9030630	9030990	No, it's funny.
9031450	9032071	All right, Loki.
9032131	9033512	They forgot to add cake.
9034161	9056446	Cake into the game Alright Miklatov, not a match Miklatov, they forgot to add Cake into the game Oh my gosh, Cake would have taken the cake Alright Alright, my answer We had to delay the release of Portal 2 Because we forgot to add Bukkake-covered space ponchos Into the game I guess that's half a point for X-Link, isn't it?
9057547	9058627	Because it worked before, right?
9059087	9062508	Alright, two points for X-Link A half point for Ziba
9063373	9063853	There you go.
9064474	9065454	Alright, one more question.
9065514	9067096	Ziba, it is not over yet.
9068597	9069437	It is not over.
9069857	9070998	You still have a chance.
9071759	9072519	You can do this.
9074080	9075701	It was officially announced tonight.
9075822	9076942	Oh, where's the music?
9077343	9078664	We can't play Mexican with no music.
9080285	9080525	Thank you.
9081826	9089071	It was officially announced tonight that the new Xbox motion controller will be called the Xbox Kinect.
9090475	9093877	Damn it, explained Loki upon hearing this news.
9094737	9101540	I had a super secret insider that told me to bet all my money on Xbox Blake.
9104462	9104762	Ding.
9105662	9106403	Ding.
9107043	9107283	Ding.
9116910	9118531	That was very fast dings there.
9118911	9123154	I had a super secret insider that told me to bet all my money on Xbox blank.
9125896	9126837	We're waiting on Ziba.
9126937	9127818	I'm dinged too, by the way.
9127838	9129919	I forgot to say that, but I have dinged my answer.
9131720	9134082	So we're just waiting on Ziba to think of an answer there.
9134742	9136323	If she needs help, you can look at the chat room.
9136363	9139766	The chatters always like to yell out some answers and try to help out a little bit.
9140847	9141547	We'll see what happens.
9143508	9143989	By the way...
9145080	9145746	This just in...
9148163	9150625	It has been posted to Twitter by Orange Right.
9151045	9151425	There it is.
9151545	9153246	President Cat in a Space Poncho.
9153286	9153907	There you have it.
9153927	9154747	DarkSakura.
9156949	9157489	I love it.
9159811	9160491	Let me post that.
9160991	9162613	That is truly creepy.
9163233	9164474	That makes me very happy too.
9165354	9168056	I'll just retweet that so all our OLR people can see that.
9168276	9169397	My Sims game froze.
9169417	9170178	I'm going to close it now.
9170218	9170618	There you go.
9170898	9171779	Now everybody can look at that.
9171799	9172979	Twitter.com slash OLR.
9172999	9174720	I went ahead and reposted that.
9175261	9176061	That's beautiful.
9178482	9179863	Alright, we got an answer here.
9180184	9180644	Let's see here.
9181365	9185469	It was officially announced tonight that the new Xbox motion controller will be called the Xbox Kinect.
9185869	9187731	Damn it, exclaimed Loki upon hearing this news.
9187871	9192576	I had a super secret insider tell me to bet all my money on Xbox... X-Link?
9193783	9194223	DarkSakura
9220049	9220910	Space Poncho The Xbox Propel
9243817	9244577	I almost had that.
9244857	9246698	The Xbox Propel.
9246858	9248338	Good answer, but not a match.
9248758	9249379	Mikhail Tov.
9249799	9251079	The Xbox Motion++.
9252219	9254360	The Xbox Motion++.
9254420	9256201	I think I see what you're doing there, but not a match.
9256921	9262642	And lastly, my name, they were going to call it the Xbox Freestyle and Pose.
9263242	9264783	The Xbox FAP.
9266423	9268524	What the hell are they doing?
9294179	9294460	All right.
9295020	9296922	Anyhow, that's going to do it for match game tonight.
9296942	9298323	The final score is Ziba.
9298463	9299364	You got a half point.
9299885	9302127	Ryan, X-Link, you got two and a half points.
9302347	9303228	X-Link is our winner.
9303348	9304429	Yay.
9304449	9305130	X-Link, good job.
9305510	9306251	A round of applause.
9306291	9307572	A good effort for Ziba.
9307692	9308813	Yay.
9308893	9309414	But she lost.
9309454	9310015	I'm sorry, Ziba.
9310315	9310815	But good effort.
9311336	9311596	All right.
9311656	9312557	At least you got a half point.
9312617	9314099	Most times these are complete shutouts.
9314599	9315260	So good job.
9316457	9324226	X-Link, as the winner, you get to plug anything you want here on the show tonight and we will even post it to Twitter, so send it to me as a private message.
9324546	9326208	What would you like to plug on tonight's program?
9327190	9327570	Don't know.
9330233	9334018	I didn't know about this ahead of time, so I really don't have anything to plug.
9334534	9335395	Alright, there you have it.
9335435	9336296	Good job, X-Lane.
9336356	9339338	He's plugging apathy.
9341981	9342661	That's actually funny.
9342681	9347766	I was just looking at Threadless and there's a shirt on there that apathy, our country's leading cause of whatever.
9348206	9352050	Why don't you plug Orange Lingerie, or plug Space Ponchos.
9352070	9352931	Why don't you do that?
9352951	9353191	Sure.
9354372	9355052	Space Ponchos.
9355072	9355493	Good night.
9357426	9357606	Night.
9358046	9358286	All right.
9358706	9361047	Congratulations to X-Link, our winner tonight.
9361707	9362788	Our completely apathetic.
9362828	9364568	I did mention the prize up front, right?
9364588	9367289	So we had like 30 minutes to think about that while that game went on way too long.
9367750	9368090	All right.
9369170	9370971	How many listeners did we lose during the match game tonight?
9370991	9371811	Just out of curiosity.
9371871	9372591	Ooh, we gained some.
9372711	9372971	Ooh.
9373912	9375832	We might have to do the match game every week.
9377493	9377753	All right.
9377893	9380414	They just wanted to hear Space Poncho said over and over again.
9380434	9381154	They did.
9381174	9384815	The people that download the podcast tomorrow, it's not going to be funny anymore after tonight.
9385515	9386876	But now we're going to milk it up for all it's worth.
9387270	9387550	PowerGig
9414720	9419663	Another game, you know, which before the whole Rock Band 3 announcement of what exactly they're going to have there.
9420023	9423705	Sounded pretty cool and unique, but it will also be out this fall.
9424125	9431429	Their guitar, of course, is actually going to be an electric guitar, a real electric guitar that also will have fret buttons on it as well.
9431909	9439573	The real difference between that and, say, the Rock Band guitar is that you can plug this directly into an amp and actually play an electric guitar.
9439833	9441696	Dave Matthews Band, Kid Rock, Eric Clapton
9456229	9456669	Thanks for watching!
9475843	9483289	Ironically though, while their guitar may be really cool, they release pics and information about their drum set, which looks like shit.
9483989	9489954	And the reason why it's pretty crappy is because you actually don't hit the drums.
9490254	9491955	You hit above the drums.
9492756	9494417	It's like playing air drums, I guess.
9495718	9498020	Which is kind of strange.
9501490	9504452	I'm just excited we're actually going to get to see this game at E3 this year.
9504853	9507054	Because when they went to PAX, they didn't show anything.
9508816	9510597	Yeah, I wish we'd see Scratch there too.
9510918	9512179	That would be kind of cool.
9512679	9515581	They might have it for the iPad or iPhone or whatever they were saying.
9516502	9520766	I'd rather see the PC version because that's one that's actually going to be kind of similar to the console release.
9520866	9521066	Yeah.
9523280	9533145	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR It's not open yet, guys.
9534486	9536247	I like how the calls start coming in instantly.
9536287	9538288	I'm sorry, I'm just looking at all the Space Poncho tweets.
9538308	9539008	It's doing pretty good.
9540169	9540869	It's doing pretty good.
9541329	9543190	It's catching on a little more than President Cat, I think.
9543631	9547413	It might actually... If the World Cup wasn't happening right now, it might trend.
9547473	9547893	We would see.
9549686	9550287	Let's see here.
9550367	9557352	Moving on to one more story, guys, about a new game from the guy who was wearing a space poncho earlier, Itagaki.
9557733	9558353	That's right.
9558573	9559174	Oh, God.
9559654	9561035	Tomonobu Itagaki.
9561095	9568961	He's the guy who did Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden, and he's kind of known for, well, tit engines, basically.
9569042	9570703	You know, if you play Dead or Alive.
9570743	9571684	Tit and blood engines.
9571724	9572124	That's right.
9572164	9572604	Good times.
9572985	9575567	Well, he left Temco, and now he's at THQ.
9576407	9578508	And they debuted the game that he is working on.
9578568	9580169	It's called Devil's Third.
9580649	9582771	It's from his new studio, Valhalla Games.
9582931	9586172	And it's violence, violence, violence, and gore.
9586573	9590515	And it's going to be on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
9590995	9593876	And there is a little trailer that's kind of surfing around the internet right now.
9593956	9598679	So we're going to take a look here at the trailer here for Devil's Third.
9598719	9600500	I just want to see all the blood and violence in this game.
9607731	9611253	Oh, wow, that shotgun made all the limbs explode.
9611273	9612554	Yeah, there were chunks coming off.
9612614	9614075	It was kind of gross, but funny.
9615816	9617197	See, this is cartoony.
9618097	9619178	I like that, the machine gun.
9619198	9620439	It's like I was flying up the building.
9623681	9625201	It doesn't look like a bad game.
9625261	9626362	I'm kind of surprised.
9626382	9626902	There you go.
9628964	9630685	See, there's a girl in this.
9630765	9632646	This is what the Hey Baby game should have been.
9633927	9634387	There it is.
9635973	9638655	The music kind of makes it more fun to watch, too.
9638715	9639856	Oh, cars exploding.
9639956	9641857	Loki, you could do some great YouTubes to this, I bet.
9643018	9643699	Devil's Third.
9643839	9644439	Looks like fun.
9644819	9645620	I bet we'll get to play it.
9645780	9646100	Yay!
9647061	9648422	And then decide it's not fun.
9649623	9650203	We'll see what happens.
9650904	9656228	All right, that's going to do it for our regular stories tonight, but we might have some last-minute stories.
9656788	9657348	I don't know.
9657448	9663593	Let's see if any last-minute stories are on deck, and then we'll get to the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9663953	9665014	Loki, you have some quick stories here?
9665932	9667233	Uh, nothing pulled up, unfortunately.
9667393	9669495	Well, luckily for you, we have a call coming in.
9669515	9670456	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9670476	9670816	Who's this?
9672517	9673558	Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.
9673818	9674779	Hi, Ray Ayanami.
9674799	9675579	What's on your mind tonight?
9676340	9682284	Um, about the Desmos thing I posted earlier, I'm pretty sure I already posted something like that months ago.
9682404	9685867	The point I wanted to make was the dialogue that they localized.
9686480	9687441	Did you see the screenshots?
9687661	9689883	Well, if you noticed, did you see how all the dialogue was localized?
9689923	9690083	Mm-hmm.
9708689	9715091	Yeah, apparently someone posted this on Shmobs4, and people pretty much exploded over it just because of how badly it was done.
9715111	9721753	I mean, it kind of reminds me of how someone would go about dubbing a 4Kids anime.
9724674	9725674	Are you going to get this game, though?
9725694	9727335	Are you going to get the Death Smiles game when it comes out?
9727675	9729275	I've already pre-ordered it.
9729455	9734697	Yeah, the shitty dialogue doesn't stop the game from being any less playable.
9735518	9765099	but it just worries but I have a slight feeling that some people might remember the game for the dialogue and not for the gameplay but then again it's a shmup and no one really plays the game for a shmup for the dialogue so I guess I'm not all that worried you play for the bullets everywhere let me ask you another question Ray and I'm going to ask this of all the callers tonight so if you're going to call into the show be prepared what are you most looking forward to about E3 next week besides Space Pontius I don't really know I don't really follow all the like
9765973	9767494	Big name stuff.
9768415	9769555	I'm more of an E3 gamer.
9771437	9772337	Alright, well, fair enough.
9773018	9774659	E3, I guess, isn't a big deal for everybody.
9775379	9775839	That's alright.
9776200	9777841	Every gamer gets a voice, even when you're wrong.
9777961	9778381	No, I'm kidding.
9778801	9779061	Alright.
9779442	9782484	Well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but do you have any last thoughts for our listeners?
9783504	9784365	Oh, yeah.
9784425	9787907	I was going to say, I got to play Escalude 2 this week.
9788247	9790969	I guess I'll talk about that on another call.
9793226	9793486	Oh, okay.
9793586	9794486	Well, what'd you think?
9794807	9796287	Give us a quick summary of what you thought.
9797147	9797787	It's pretty fun.
9797807	9805750	It's kind of like most bullet hell shooters, except being slowdown bullets and among other things.
9808230	9809811	Did you like it or pass?
9810251	9816813	It's pretty fun, but I keep holding back from playing the game just because of how difficult it is to play for score.
9817933	9818233	All right.
9818834	9821757	Well, keep playing and let us know what you think, all right?
9822297	9822578	All right.
9822718	9822938	All right.
9823078	9823538	Take care, buddy.
9823959	9824299	See you.
9824319	9824459	Later.
9824479	9824800	All right.
9825580	9828123	We're going to get some more calls here on the Skype line.
9828143	9828883	877-GAME-OLR.
9829024	9831286	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9831346	9832127	Let's get to another call.
9832507	9833488	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9833528	9833908	Who's this?
9837472	9837852	Hello.
9837872	9838533	Hola.
9838573	9840274	Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
9840454	9840815	Quienes?
9842867	9844809	Uh-oh, we have a bad call.
9845110	9849194	Remember, call Echo 123 before you call Orange Lounge Radio.
9849214	9851777	It's a good way to test your connection to make sure it works.
9852939	9854080	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9854100	9854461	Who's this?
9855677	9856578	This is Scarzo.
9856598	9857418	What's up, Rob?
9857498	9859339	What is up, Scarzo?
9859419	9860440	What is on your mind, buddy?
9861540	9864702	I just want to tell Miklatov, you know, I jumped in my GMC DeLorean.
9864742	9866323	I thought I saw him on Friday night.
9866423	9869164	I totally forgot to post that on the chat line.
9869745	9875788	I saw somebody who was actually kind of bummed out about DJ Max Technica being down on Friday night.
9875808	9877589	You guys were there on Saturday, right?
9877689	9879830	It's not just you, Miklatov.
9879870	9884253	I could imagine that a lot of people would be upset about that because it's supposed to be a really, really good game.
9884935	9890396	Let me tell you, Mikotov, straight up, dude, because Roosevelt Golf Land, Rob, go ahead and fill in your input.
9891077	9892917	Roosevelt Golf Land is crap, by the way.
9893357	9894157	Here's the problem.
9894538	9896418	They had a problem with the hard drive.
9896918	9898859	This was when I started playing back in December.
9899459	9901019	They were getting a lot of blue screen of dev.
9901059	9902079	The game was lagging.
9902120	9903040	It was slowing down.
9903080	9903860	It was just horrible.
9903920	9907561	So the problem was they would just have to restart it, and I can just keep going.
9908342	9912446	It wasn't until like maybe a month ago where it just blue screened.
9912806	9917191	They would restart it because they know I'm the regular over there and I will always play during Arcade Mania.
9917672	9919674	And I'm like Friday, Saturday nights after I get off work.
9920435	9922857	The problem was it runs on Windows XP, by the way.
9923338	9925901	It starts up and it says that the program cannot start.
9926670	9928491	I like it about a thousand million times better.
9945259	9948860	You have to remember Miklatov is totally biased and partial towards Korean music.
9948880	9950841	This is very true.
9950941	9953042	Did you try to get it in DDR here in America?
9953102	9953762	Korean stuff?
9953802	9954022	Yeah.
9954122	9954362	No.
9954882	9955903	I thought you tried to do that.
9955963	9956743	No, that would be cool.
9956803	9957423	No, no.
9957763	9958324	I might have.
9958384	9959084	I don't remember.
9959164	9961465	I don't know how much I'm allowed to talk about.
9962746	9966729	Let's assume, let's hypothesize you got to actually suggest songs for inclusion in the game.
9967189	9968710	Wouldn't you have written down a bunch of Korean songs?
9969130	9973834	I think I might have, but I was more always leaning towards 90s music.
9974114	9978958	Because who wouldn't want to do like, you know, Rhythm is a Dancer.
9979078	9980879	But then it all ended up in Hardest Party, and I was like...
9980919	9981079	DJ Maxx
9998357	10002301	and I swear I played that for like eight hours straight because it was just that much fun.
10002341	10008246	Yeah, you've got mission mode, you've got, you know, really good songs and, you know, it's worth it.
10009027	10012650	I can't really throw my support too much behind the American version.
10013051	10013952	It was decent.
10014672	10015252	DJ Maxx Fever
10041199	10069501	it's not a terrible game it's just there were a lot of problems with it that they have not released an update to fix but you know you get some of the best songs from the first two games in it definitely if you can get it for like I don't know 10 or 15 bucks that's worth it I wouldn't pay more than more than 15 for it though okay and did you hear about the Technica 2 soundtrack being leaked because I can't find that yet and that's a tough one just the limited edition version
10070399	10078723	Yeah, it's on a Korean website because I'm friends with some of the Sunnyvale Golf Line players because that's where most of the top score, the elitist players are.
10079203	10084005	And one of them got their hands on it and they were telling me about it and I was just like, man, I gotta look for that.
10084325	10093489	I bought through a website the limited edition Technica soundtrack that came with the card and the keychain and the soundtrack.
10094689	10100232	and I actually have it with me too because it's a good card holder and I knew I'd get my hands on some of the Technica 1 cards.
10101233	10103794	The soundtrack is crap though.
10103954	10105334	I was hearing mixed reviews.
10105415	10106215	Don't get me wrong.
10106295	10107015	I like the music.
10107095	10108396	It's something new for my ears.
10108876	10110357	Don't get me wrong.
10110437	10111157	I want to give it a shot.
10111197	10112418	Technica has way better music.
10112458	10118981	Technica 1 and at least when Technica 2, if it's not already out for real, it will have most of that Technica 1 music on it.
10119681	10121462	Oh, yeah, definitely.
10121562	10124563	I want to jump in here because I do have to wrap up and get to other calls, but I like this caller.
10124603	10125203	He's got energy.
10125263	10125723	He's local.
10125763	10126523	He knows what he's talking about.
10126723	10129844	I know, and I can talk about DJ Max, and that's something I can do for hours.
10130024	10131885	I know, and so if I don't jump in here, that won't happen.
10131905	10134186	Hey, Rob, this is your boy, Jay Hugo, on Twitter, by the way.
10134206	10135146	Not trying to put a plug.
10135186	10135846	Don't follow me.
10135906	10136466	I'm just saying.
10136526	10138047	This is your boy, Jay Hugo, okay?
10138167	10138407	All right.
10138467	10142428	No, I appreciate it, and one of these days, if I actually go to Roseville Golf Land again, although you missed it.
10142468	10143108	I was there Saturday.
10143428	10144048	We'll meet up.
10144229	10145509	What was I going to say?
10145569	10147049	Oh, I'm asking all the callers this.
10147430	10148830	What are you looking forward to at E3 this year?
10150057	10153981	Man, you know, okay, like, I'm not a big, I don't play fighters, but I love watching it.
10154081	10155443	It feels like a competitive movie.
10155823	10157865	Marvel vs. Capcom, I got a bunch of friends.
10158346	10159928	That looks pretty cool, in my opinion.
10160188	10165113	I mean, I would go, if I could go to E3 with you, I'd be there for the bukkake, but you know, that's another radio show.
10165293	10165774	So we can't be
10166034	10167735	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
10168815	10171396	Are you sure you want that to be put in the podcast?
10171416	10172636	I don't know.
10172676	10173377	I'm just saying.
10173457	10174117	I'm just saying.
10174297	10175737	I mean, you can go bleep me out.
10175797	10176478	I'm just saying.
10176498	10176958	No, no, it's funny.
10176998	10177258	It's funny.
10177598	10177878	All right.
10178678	10179138	I like him.
10179179	10179639	He's funny.
10179679	10181799	We're going to have to get him on the show at some point.
10181819	10182079	I know.
10182120	10185201	I wish he would be there and the Technica machine would be working.
10185221	10186381	We could always have a good time.
10187102	10190688	Oh yeah, one quick thing, Platinum Crew is great.
10190748	10194836	Technica 2, dual mixing, blah blah blah, the interface is a little weird.
10195076	10196599	Oh, I love that interface for 2.
10196779	10197560	It looks so nice.
10198556	10198756	It is.
10198836	10199356	It's beautiful.
10199576	10203538	But not as hot as the classicalized singer, the female, when she had long hair, though.
10203578	10204418	That's what I got to say.
10204738	10207399	Coming soon is going to be a new podcast, apparently.
10207739	10209640	Ironically, a music game podcast with these two.
10209660	10211221	They're just going to talk for hours about it.
10211421	10212001	I could do it.
10212401	10213462	All right.
10213522	10214582	I'll let you go.
10214682	10215202	I'll let you go.
10215262	10216243	I'll let you guys go.
10216483	10217123	Have a good night.
10217143	10217863	First time calling.
10217903	10219484	Thank you so much for everything.
10219584	10221845	And, man, I've been missing out on the last eight years, but I'm here now.
10222185	10223085	So let's keep it going, guys.
10223205	10224306	Glad to have you, buddy.
10224486	10225086	You have a good one.
10226046	10226586	He's a good guy.
10226646	10228907	He always pimps our show on the Twitter and stuff.
10228927	10230007	Don't think I don't notice that stuff.
10230027	10230907	I really appreciate that.
10231168	10232428	He's very enthusiastic about the show.
10232448	10233628	Let's take another call from him.
10233648	10234508	I really appreciate it.
10234628	10236389	No, we've got to get to more other calls.
10236949	10240930	But first, guys, I know you think I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's E3.
10241090	10244391	I can't control when there is breaking news.
10245131	10245151	E3
10252967	10268685	Tom Brokaw here, Bukake, anyway, no, what I really wanted to point out was that it has been revealed that there is a Star Wars game, we mentioned this before, there is a Star Wars game for Kinect, and it has been announced it will feature controller-free lightsaber fighting.
10270088	10271148	I know, how does that work?
10271168	10271468	I don't know.
10271849	10272509	But here's the thing.
10272589	10274649	You've got to love Microsoft.
10275169	10276090	You've got to love them.
10276130	10278290	Well, you can hate them, but you've got to love them.
10278930	10283711	They don't even make it a secret that they just rip off other people's ideas and make it better.
10284012	10287872	What is everybody wanted on the Wii since the first day people put their hands on the controller?
10288433	10289633	Lightsaber battles.
10289673	10290713	But is it going to be better?
10290733	10292173	Because you won't have anything in your hands.
10292514	10293614	It's like the videos for...
10294634	10298715	I'm just gonna find a random object, like, I don't know, like a pie roller.
10298755	10301536	If you go to Kotaku right now, their top story there is showing the space ponchos, and they have video.
10314019	10314419	What is that?
10314439	10315100	This is creepy.
10315120	10315840	They're plant people.
10316140	10316500	They're moving...
10343237	10345259	What the fuck does this have to do with video games?
10345279	10346900	This is why we have to go tomorrow.
10352265	10355428	They're just... They're plant people.
10356969	10358551	I thought there was going to be video of the Space Ponchos.
10358571	10359451	I thought so too.
10359471	10359952	Not the plant people.
10359992	10361033	Fuck the plant people.
10361053	10362394	Where's bald dude in the Space Poncho?
10362454	10362954	That's what I want.
10375600	10378701	It's gotta be really hot with all those people wearing those silvery space ponchos.
10378741	10382003	I wonder if you can go on YouTube.
10382783	10383584	I love commenters.
10383624	10386265	I was wondering if YouTube has some space poncho.
10386885	10387866	No, they'd be on Twitter.
10388366	10393348	I know our boy Bobby Blackwolf is monitoring the Twitters right now.
10394689	10397150	And he will let us know the incident of space poncho.
10397170	10398911	Because he's trying to get the space poncho thing to trend.
10399051	10399331	Hey, Rob.
10399611	10399811	What?
10399851	10401433	SpacePacho5.
10403915	10404216	Let's see.
10404276	10406037	By the way, comments from chat room here.
10406137	10410902	BlackWolf has apparently also read it as an on-rails lightsaber game.
10411563	10411803	Weird.
10413991	10417152	I don't care about Star Wars, it's whatever
10441997	10442978	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10457293	10459434	Project Under $100 is back on.
10459474	10471740	It's basically, as I put it, an experiment in frugality and engineering that's basically going to be tasked in building a working MAME machine.
10471800	10477282	This is a PC in an arcade cabinet with arcade controls under $100.
10477322	10477602	That's easy.
10480089	10481090	You would think it would be.
10481631	10482031	It's not.
10498411	10502176	Buying everything for under $100, a lot harder than it sounds.
10502337	10504019	So donations don't count towards your under $100.
10504319	10505461	Donations do not count.
10506102	10507204	Everything must be purchased.
10508365	10514133	Except, of course, construction materials like tape or glue and that kind of stuff.
10514313	10515375	I'm assuming that you have that.
10515475	10518418	I was gonna say in my backyard I have an empty arcade cabinet.
10518438	10520981	We have a ton of controllers and buttons.
10521021	10521842	Yes, yes.
10521922	10523464	Basically, it's worst case scenario.
10523684	10527829	I mean, if you wanted to and you didn't have anything, could you do it under $100?
10527869	10529230	And the answer is yes.
10529430	10530331	I gotta get back to the phones.
10530371	10531793	They are blowing up, you guys.
10531813	10532554	Did you give out the URL?
10533126	10559431	Oh yes, the URL is under $100 $100 is the number under$100mame.blogspot.com There'll be a link on Orange Lounge later By the way guys, we need a Space Poncho page on Wikipedia, like right now and get it created and then link it to all of us before On our wiki I would think official Wikipedia should have Space Poncho Both Let's get to another call, we gotta try and blow through these calls Our phone lines are blowing up tonight Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10560091	10560952	Hey, this is Ingo.
10561233	10562494	Hey, Ingo, what's on your mind?
10562534	10563536	I'm glad we can hear you this time.
10563556	10563976	What's on your mind?
10564637	10566199	I want a space poncho.
10566259	10566800	Me too!
10567942	10569303	Sadly, I have to work tomorrow.
10569343	10570545	Boo hoo.
10570565	10571486	What if you're sick?
10572528	10572928	What's on your mind?
10572948	10576153	What the hell is going on with these Microsoft pictures?
10576173	10577695	It's like cavemen that are emo.
10579195	10581377	Wait, cavemen that are emo, Microsoft?
10581437	10583258	Are you talking about the pictures from the event, or what?
10583358	10589743	Yeah, it's the one where they're like, it's like on a hill, and they're like, there's the big ol' logo there, and there's a TV or something.
10589823	10592706	Cirque du Soleil is like that modern art thing, you know?
10592726	10595068	Wouldn't you be emo if you didn't have fire?
10597229	10626356	I would be emo if my space poncho wasn't changing colors like it's supposed to imagine if the space ponchos glowed blue you're just giving me more reason to make you call in sick tomorrow not calling in sick tomorrow what else was I going to say what do you most want to see at E3 Ingo Medal of Honor and Power Gig do you know any rumors about these different series and where they're going I think Medal of Honor is going to blow Modern Warfare 2 out of the water
10627006	10628187	Ooh, them's fighting words.
10628247	10628667	Why is that?
10629667	10632969	Because it's... I don't know.
10633449	10634470	Because it looks awesome.
10634630	10636250	And the guy looks like ZZ Top.
10638652	10639892	Well, there's a good reason right there.
10640713	10641013	Awesome.
10641613	10647536	Well, you know, I hope you enjoy E3 and all the news that's coming out of it and get some stuff.
10647556	10649257	Is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?
10649837	10650697	I have an announcement.
10650917	10651118	Yes.
10651238	10653018	I officially quit Infinity Ward.
10654219	10655039	Oh my gosh.
10655079	10656280	Wait, did you work for Infinity Ward?
10656997	10657297	Yeah.
10657678	10658059	You did?
10658779	10659060	Yeah.
10659561	10660181	I didn't know that.
10660201	10660442	Wow.
10660522	10662945	I didn't know we had listeners of Infinity Ward listening to this show.
10664047	10664768	Wow, okay.
10665849	10670415	Now I work for a different developer that I don't want to talk about.
10670996	10674420	Can we ask you why you quit Infinity Ward, or is it one of those, like, it ought to be obvious, Rob?
10676121	10676481	Kind of.
10676942	10679622	Pre-shift contract on Activision's side.
10680182	10680663	Oh, okay.
10680883	10681203	All right.
10681743	10682283	How about that?
10682363	10683723	I had no idea.
10683823	10684124	All right.
10684164	10688125	Well, good luck to you on your new endeavors, whatever they may be.
10688405	10689165	Will we see you at E3?
10689205	10690445	Are you going to be at E3?
10690585	10692026	No, because they don't let programmers really go.
10692046	10692506	Probably.
10693266	10693826	I'll be there.
10694006	10695347	You just probably won't see me.
10696347	10697367	Oh, well, okay then.
10697547	10697807	All right.
10698748	10700608	Well, say hello if you do happen to see us, all right?
10700948	10701368	Okay.
10701388	10701748	Bye-bye.
10701788	10702349	Have a good E3.
10703129	10703389	You too.
10703949	10704309	Alright.
10705750	10706090	Who knew?
10706130	10708652	How often were we covering those Infinity Ward stories?
10708692	10710693	We had somebody listening who worked on it.
10711053	10711593	You never know.
10714155	10715716	You know, I really hate to do this to you.
10716196	10719898	I really hate to do it, but at the same time, it's E3, guys.
10720598	10721219	What now?
10732430	10737253	Apparently SingStar has a new game that is being revealed at E3.
10737374	10740716	It is called SingStar Dance.
10741536	10744919	And it's being revealed at Sony's press conference on Tuesday morning.
10745359	10748721	It's supposedly compatible with the PS3 Move controllers.
10748761	10749922	SingStar Dance.
10750022	10751883	News is leaking out about that tonight.
10751963	10756346	If you're going to hold the microphone and the Move controllers in your hand, how is that going to work?
10756426	10757547	I don't think you actually sing.
10757587	10758648	I think it's just a dance game.
10758688	10759028	Call it out.
10759088	10761269	I don't have a SingStar title.
10762431	10763572	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10763612	10763993	Who's this?
10764935	10767779	This is the Space Poncho-less SSJ100 Matt.
10767819	10770504	Hello, SSJ100 Matt, our Space Poncho-loving friend.
10770544	10771245	What's on your mind, buddy?
10772332	10772732	Not much.
10773512	10781695	I quickly want to get your guys' thoughts on, you know, I have a feeling that this E3, they're going to be ramming the 3D gaming down our throats.
10781995	10782235	Yes.
10782375	10783275	What do you guys think?
10784035	10788817	I think it can go suck my dick because I am not a big fan of E3.
10789497	10790257	Wow.
10791798	10792638	That's going to get cut.
10792998	10794340	I'm a big fan of E3.
10794380	10794820	I love them.
10795180	10796262	It's 3D.
10796362	10800206	I am not a big fan of it because it makes me sick when it gets to that level.
10800286	10803990	Like watching Avatar in the theater for like two hours and all that.
10804551	10808375	I think all these games are just too much.
10809915	10813179	I hate it if I have to buy a new TV and glasses for it.
10813579	10820407	However, I will probably support the 3DS because it's all built in and I won't have a problem with that.
10820427	10821888	But I don't want to buy updates to games.
10821908	10823090	I don't want to buy special glasses.
10823150	10824131	I don't want a $2,000 TV.
10824151	10827254	I do want a $2,000 TV, but I don't want it for that reason.
10829076	10856826	I'm extremely apprehensive about the 3DS but I will check it out and give it a fair shot and may I be wrong I will come out on the show Tuesday night you'll know I will post the little Rob Roberts and pals at E3 and if I'm wrong I will say I was wrong this thing is awesome if they have a Pokemon game I'm sold if you want to blame anyone for this whole 3D thing you gotta blame the TV makers because everyone now is buying everyone pretty much has an HDTV I don't know the exact numbers household wise but
10858054	10862296	They want to try to crank out new hardware, new stuff for people to buy.
10862656	10866018	The HD TVs and 3D TVs are completely different.
10866539	10875604	Yeah, I know, but everyone pretty much has an HD TV now, so they're trying to get people to get the new upgrade, the new tech.
10876084	10876645	What do you think?
10876685	10878486	I'm turning this on you, SSJ100Mal.
10878506	10879727	What do you think of 3D games?
10881428	10885210	I think it could work, but I don't think now is the proper time.
10886453	10887294	Now is too early.
10887354	10888715	This is all happening too fast.
10888795	10891637	The movies are one thing and then the rest is just too much.
10892197	10892498	Too much.
10892518	10899102	And when our economy is a little more stable, when we're able to be a little more frugal to go out and spend these $3,000 TVs with $150...
10903450	10922905	I'll look into it but you know right now very little TV is 3D now I mean I know ESPN has jumped on it I know different sports are doing it but you know it's just too early let me ask you this real quick what thing at E3 are you looking forward to the most?
10924346	10929710	I want Microsoft to give us more games for live you know like 1 vs 100
10931263	10932224	Where are those games?
10932444	10933505	Yeah, whatever happened to that?
10934145	10935466	You know what I want to see?
10935506	10936707	I want to see them do Match Game.
10937428	10938509	I would love Match Game.
10938529	10939550	That would be amazing.
10939650	10940390	Match with thousands of people.
10940410	10948237	The only thing we need to do is just hook up a couple of Xbox 360 Slims and revive Charles Nelson Reilly.
10948757	10949898	Oh my god, that would be wonderful.
10949918	10951139	It would be great.
10951479	10957304	Alright, as of today, we're going to let you go so we can get at least one more call here on this long-running show tonight, but thanks so much for your call.
10957924	10958064	Yep.
10958305	10958765	Have a good one, buddy.
10960408	10961829	I guess the Kinect event is over.
10961929	10962870	That's what Black Wolf says.
10963010	10964131	I don't know what happened.
10964651	10966573	People probably just walked out.
10967153	10968394	I don't think they walked out.
10968955	10970596	Did it blow people's minds?
10970676	10971337	That's what I want to know.
10971377	10973999	Was it a mind-blowing experience?
10974999	10976801	Were your minds blown?
10978662	10979383	Last call of the night.
10979423	10980404	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10980424	10980784	Who's this?
10981965	10987109	You know, I'd rather walk around and wear a space poncho throughout Manhattan than play Final Fantasy VIII again.
10988351	10989412	Amen to that.
10989953	10990773	Boom.
10990833	10991434	I do both.
10991674	10991994	Whatever.
10992455	10992735	All right.
10993035	10995417	What is on your mind tonight, Ranma?
10997139	10999401	I'll make this quick because I know you guys are running late.
10999421	11005246	About a few weeks back, I finally got my hands on Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero Van Halen.
11007427	11007788	Okay.
11008188	11010450	So first tell us about Beatles Rock Band.
11011551	11013473	I've only played a couple of tracks of it and...
11014514	11018295	Honestly, my personal opinion, I would not have paid $59.
11018435	11021756	I would have paid $39 or $49 for it.
11021796	11024337	Luckily, I got it on clearance for $9.99 at Target.
11027057	11027778	Hmm, okay.
11028378	11030018	Wait, $9.99 for Beatles?
11030698	11033119	Yeah, select stores at the time were clearing them out.
11033199	11034819	I'm walking in, just checking what they had.
11035259	11037620	I saw Van Halen for $15 on clearance.
11037660	11040701	I looked over and saw Beatles for $10, so I grabbed that too.
11043852	11044253	Awesome.
11044793	11050680	Well, I mean, and you like the game or it's kind of one of those, well, I'm really happy I didn't pay $60 for this.
11051421	11057287	I'm really glad I didn't pay $60 for either game because I was really hyped for Guitar Hero Van Halen.
11057347	11058048	I really was.
11058328	11060210	So I started playing through it and I'm like...
11061195	11062796	I'm not so hyped anymore.
11063356	11068978	And the one thing that pissed me off is that I'm halfway through the game with the drums.
11069018	11072380	I figured, let me finish up the other half of the game on guitar.
11072820	11076122	No, I have to go through everything all over again with the guitar.
11076782	11078042	And I said, screw this.
11079683	11080183	Interesting.
11081284	11081564	All right.
11082444	11084325	What about Van Halen, Guitar Hero?
11085126	11086706	That's the one I was talking about.
11086986	11087427	Oh, okay.
11087587	11088227	Yeah, yeah.
11089483	11093064	I'm still hoping that one of my favorite songs is in the game, but I don't think it is.
11093164	11095785	But I just enjoyed the music.
11095825	11098206	That's the main reason why I got it in the first place.
11098746	11104888	And honestly, I think Activision really needs to step their game up because we just got Green Day Rock Band and well...
11106531	11111954	I'm really liking that a lot more and I think that's how you really need to do the expansion titles, more like that.
11112194	11124581	Instead of having practically all the songs unlocked and all you're doing is unlocking venues and so forth, start out with six or seven songs and start unlocking all the songs as you play.
11128724	11130545	Did you play the Green Day Rock Band by chance yet?
11132014	11133195	Yeah, we have it here.
11133595	11135035	My roommate picked it up last week.
11135215	11136316	I'm trying to line up an interview.
11136336	11141918	If I've seen out of it, I'm trying to line up an interview for the last part of the show here, so I'm half listening and half doing this.
11142518	11144979	Sorry if I'm the only one engaging our caller right now.
11144999	11147300	We have a caller?
11147480	11153483	Before this is over, I want to throw in my two cents on this whole Project $10 bullshit.
11153703	11154343	Yeah, please do.
11155003	11156684	I think we just got his 10 cents.
11157944	11158625	It's bullshit.
11158745	11159405	I'm sorry.
11159485	11166987	You mean to tell me after I spent 50 bucks on live, I gotta spend another $10 for online gaming?
11167828	11168568	If you buy used.
11170268	11170448	Used?
11170769	11173169	I don't care.
11173429	11181052	And remember, GameStop now is deducting $10 from the price of their games, so in a sense, it's not really going to be any more money.
11182765	11187207	Yeah, but then the new game buyers get screwed because now their games are worth way less.
11187507	11188767	Yes, the trade-ins will be worth less.
11189728	11190008	Don't.
11190268	11191108	They pay for it either way.
11192109	11197071	And they're saying that this money's going to go pay for the servers and the people that admin it?
11197331	11198832	That's bullshit.
11198852	11205514	That money's going to upper management to fatten their pockets because I'm on that echelon of code monkeys and tech guys.
11206375	11209356	We are the underappreciated folk in this world.
11210507	11214329	Of course it was a bullshit corporate speak, but we knew that.
11214890	11219572	Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week, as I've been asking everybody tonight?
11220312	11232959	I'm actually looking forward to hearing all of what Microsoft has to say, what Nintendo has to say, and I'm really curious about this supposed price cut to $199 by Sony.
11233499	11237901	I'm really curious about this, because I heard that twice, and I'm like, that's too good to be true.
11239182	11239402	Hmm.
11242313	11243655	Anything else you want to say about E3?
11243675	11246558	No, that's pretty much it.
11246658	11247158	That's it.
11247439	11247739	All right.
11248260	11253545	Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show here and get out and all that fun stuff.
11253605	11255147	But thank you so much for your call.
11255187	11256629	And sorry I was only like half listening.
11256669	11258110	There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes here.
11258210	11258571	My bad.
11259151	11259632	That's okay.
11259672	11260353	We love you, too.
11260393	11261574	Just wait till you come out to Brooklyn.
11261614	11262255	Yeah, goody, goody.
11262355	11262635	All right.
11262655	11263096	Mwah, mwah.
11264566	11266167	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the skyline.
11266207	11273533	Sorry guys, we're getting hammered tonight, but so many of you didn't get through and I'm sorry, but please feel free to send us some emails.
11274333	11281479	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to get through a little in a different way, I guess you could say.
11281939	11287903	Alright, let's go ahead and go around and kind of start to wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts.
11287983	11289384	It's going to be an awesome E3.
11289444	11290225	I'm very excited.
11290265	11292467	I really hope I'm not sick or I'm going to be fucking mad.
11293087	11298008	But we'll bring you, again, special shows Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, as soon as we can get them posted.
11298048	11300048	If you don't see anything Tuesday night, don't freak out.
11300569	11301409	Something just went wrong.
11301449	11302629	We're trying to get an internet connection.
11303209	11304930	Or we went to play DJ Max.
11305010	11305370	Perhaps.
11306310	11307450	So, final thoughts.
11307490	11307890	Are we ready?
11308070	11308930	My water's boiling.
11309610	11309831	All right.
11309851	11310711	Well, bye, Dark Sakura.
11310871	11311691	At least it's not breaking.
11312211	11312491	All right.
11313951	11315132	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11316952	11321453	My final thought is this week will be fun to watch all the different press conferences.
11322355	11325318	My final thought is I'm excited to go home and take some NyQuil!
11325418	11326098	Yay!
11326819	11329441	Here's one last thing I wanted to think about here.
11329982	11330622	Ponder, maybe.
11331223	11336427	I wonder if we'll have space ponchos for our avatars on Xbox Live.
11337648	11338349	That would be amazing.
11339270	11340531	That'd absolutely be amazing.
11341503	11343004	Miklatov, thank you for being here.
11343064	11345666	You came out all the way from Kansas just to be on the show, I'm sure.
11345847	11347908	Yeah, that was exactly my reason.
11348109	11349430	Nothing to do with E3 or Technica.
11349630	11351171	Mostly Technica.
11351612	11352613	Do you have any final thoughts?
11353754	11365645	My final thought is I hope that leaked floor plans for E3 are true and I get to play Pokemon Black and White and see Dragon Age 2 because those are probably the games that will be my highlights of the show.
11366365	11366645	All right.
11366945	11367566	Well, we'll see.
11367646	11370867	We're just a few days away from the show floor being open.
11370907	11371887	It's less than 48 hours.
11372588	11373088	Excited.
11373148	11373388	All right.
11373868	11379690	We'll see you in a couple days with the Rob Robertson Pals special from E3, and then we will all be here in studio next week.
11379810	11381151	Loki, DarkSakura, and myself.
11381231	11383392	Loki and DarkSakura will be scouring up and down the internet.
