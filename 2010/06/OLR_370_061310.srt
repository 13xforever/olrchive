00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,520
Tonight, June 13th, 2010, the E3 News Barrage begins and we connect with our listeners to

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:32,040
get all your feedback on the early news.

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,360
Hello my friends out there on the internet.

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,740
Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,440
This is episode number 370 for June the 13th of 2010.

6
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,880
We are that video game show where every gamer has a voice and walking you over the next

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,120
few hours on this very, very busy show tonight, myself, Rob Roberts, and joined us always

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,760
by the one, the only, but the sadly sickly, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,320
I'm not sick anymore.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,720
But you're going to sound it on the radio though because you have your voice thing going

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
on.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:13,960
The problem is I had a viral infection and it coughed my throat, well, bloody, so I'm

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,440
actually not supposed to use my voice much until the 21st.

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,080
So Dark Sakura's role in tonight's show will be scaled back just a little bit, just a little,

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,040
but she'll still be here to provide her always insightful commentary, of course.

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,200
I've got some snark.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
You just might, yes.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
Being sick makes a person a little extra snarky, I find.

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,840
I am also a little sick.

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,800
Just now the E3 is coming up, I have this gift, I don't know what you want to call it,

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,560
where I tend to get sick at big gaming conventions.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,400
It happened at PAX East earlier this year and now it's happening again for E3.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Hooray.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,280
Well, also joining us tonight, say hello to the well and healthy, at least for now, Tech

25
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Master Loki.

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,320
I am perfectly fine, except in my head.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,620
I am sick in the head.

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,640
But that's why we love you here on Orange Lounge Radio.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,040
Loki, which we're coming up on, if you can believe it, our eighth anniversary show in

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
a couple weeks.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,740
But we've got to get through E3 before we get there.

32
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,920
Joining us tonight, this is a little bit special because in the eight year history of Orange

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,080
Lounge Radio, this guy used to come on the show quite a bit, but then kind of took a

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,640
break for a little while, because he moved to this place in the Midwest.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,520
I don't know why anyone would want to do that.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,200
But he's back tonight to say hello and try to get into E3 with us.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,720
Say hello to the one and only Miklotov is here tonight.

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
Hello.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
How are you doing?

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm good.

41
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,320
Now, for those listeners who've never heard you here on the show before, give us like

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
a summary.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
What do you do?

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,360
What have you been doing over the past eight years of video games here on the alarm?

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Let's see.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Working.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,520
I work at a video game store now.

48
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,280
So I went from working at a video game company to a video game store.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,200
And for those who don't know, you used to work for?

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Konami.

51
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Yes.

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
And can you say what you did at Konami or was that a secret?

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Yeah.

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,960
I did DDR and I made the steps and with, you know, the other people on the team.

55
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,480
And I did text stuff and yeah, that's what I did there.

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Good times.

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,520
Oh, I got drunk because it was fun.

58
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,040
Is that why the games were crap?

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
You all were drinking.

60
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm just kidding.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
It might have been.

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,120
Actually, I will say UltraMix 2, which I know you guys worked on, was the best DDR game

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,160
that ever came out of the USA.

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Probably.

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah.

66
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Absolutely.

67
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
So, well, what happened?

68
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Are you allowed to talk about what happened?

69
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
I don't know.

70
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Maybe Supernova.

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Supernova was really good.

72
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Are you allowed to talk about what happened?

73
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Why you no longer at Konami?

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,280
Oh, yeah.

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,240
They just moved and I didn't want to move because I didn't have a permanent quote unquote

76
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
position.

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,000
So I wasn't going to get paid to move down to where they moved their offices to.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,720
So I decided time to leave.

79
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
And so you went back to where your family is, correct?

80
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
Yes.

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Which is in the Midwest.

82
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Yeah.

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
All right.

84
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I agree.

85
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm just kidding.

86
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
All right.

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
But things are good for you in Kansas.

88
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Kansas treating you well?

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Yeah.

90
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Good enough.

91
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Well, welcome back to the show.

92
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
I'm sure you haven't listened since the last time you've been on.

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Like for the past three weeks.

94
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Oh, that's right.

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
You've been commenting in chat and stuff.

96
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah.

97
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,160
The show's kind of different now than it was when you were first coming onto the show,

98
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
huh?

99
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,080
I don't know much about the music games anymore, but there aren't very many great music games

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
anymore.

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
So it's okay.

102
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
It makes sense.

103
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,640
For our new listeners, real quick, can you kind of define what did Orange Lawns Radio

104
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,600
used to be when you were first coming to this show?

105
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,280
Oh, it was like everybody didn't know what they were doing more so than now.

106
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,960
And it was like, let's talk about DDR for like an hour or two.

107
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
All right.

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Bye.

109
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
That was it.

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
That's pretty much it.

111
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
You got it.

112
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
All right.

113
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
But we're still here.

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,680
We're still coming up and we're going to talk a lot about E3 tonight with Mikle Tov.

115
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,360
And speaking of which, we have big, big news coming out of the big cities tonight.

116
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,420
We're going to start off the show a little differently tonight.

117
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:59,280
We have an Orange Lawns Radio special report.

118
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
That's right.

119
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,880
We do have some big breaking news.

120
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,640
It does appear that Scarlett Johansson has won the Tony for best performance by a featured

121
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,200
actress in a play for A View From The Bridge.

122
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,120
Congratulations to Scarlett Johansson.

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
You hot bitch.

124
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
We all...

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
Okay.

126
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
E3.

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Yeah.

128
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
No, there's some huge news coming out of E3.

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,280
Obviously, tonight is Microsoft's big reveal of Project Natal.

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
And they...

131
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Not necessarily the press conference.

132
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,280
Yes.

133
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,080
It's not their press conference, but it's their Cirque du Soleil as imagined by Cirque

134
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,280
du Soleil or as one of my friends calls it Cirque du Soguet as Project Natal is being

135
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,560
reinvented or reimagined or whatever they're doing.

136
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,400
I like how Patton Oswalt describes it.

137
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,400
What does he describe it as?

138
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,640
It's French and gay and on fire.

139
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,840
That's pretty much what it is.

140
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,600
So Project Natal is French and gay and on fire and it is now called the Microsoft Connect.

141
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,160
And that's thanks to a report leaking out from USA Today.

142
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,400
It's Connect K-I-N-E-C-T, Microsoft Connect.

143
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,360
Kind of a play on the word kinetic, I guess you could say.

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,200
I think we'll hear a little more about that as word leaks out of tonight's event as well

145
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,520
as Monday's press conference.

146
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,440
However, did you know there will not be streaming of tonight's little special event because

147
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,160
there's been a block on it all because MTV has the exclusive rights to air it.

148
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that one of the early games announced for

149
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,120
Microsoft Connect is coming from MTV Games.

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,760
Here it is, folks.

151
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,920
Dance Central.

152
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,480
And USA Today is calling it a So You Think You Can Dance experience home, although it's

153
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,800
not for sure if the brand name actually plays into it.

154
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Probably not.

155
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,680
But if you want to tie in directly to last week's show, there's your Timberland Cascada

156
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,960
game and all those things we were talking about.

157
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Did I say Timberland like a tree?

158
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Timber...

159
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,240
Timberland and Cascada and all those things we were talking about last week.

160
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
That's gotta be it.

161
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
That's it.

162
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Whatever.

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,400
So that's one of the early games coming out of the Kinetic.

164
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,360
Also announced, I'm sure to much surprise, Kinetic Sports!

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,280
With six activities, who knew, boxing, bowling, volleyball, track and field, soccer, and table

166
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
tennis.

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Wow.

168
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
And the Vomitarium.

169
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
The Vomitarium?

170
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,680
That might be in Connect Adventures.

171
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,440
I'm sorry, hurling.

172
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,960
River Raft Time Trial, Obstacle Course, up to four players on the raft playing as a duo.

173
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,640
You and a partner lean one way or another to steer.

174
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,600
Also a game called Joyride, which was originally announced a little while ago, got pulled from

175
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,440
Xbox.com and then came back.

176
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
It's a racing game.

177
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,320
That's the one where you're going to hold the imaginary steering wheel and drive back

178
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,760
and forth.

179
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Connectimals!

180
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,580
You train and play 20 different virtual cats, including a lion, a cheetah, and a tiger.

181
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,480
It's kind of like PokeCats, but with Connect.

182
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,960
I don't know what else to call that.

183
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,580
And lastly, and this is pretty big, Star Wars characters and Disney favorites will be featured

184
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,680
in separate new games being developed at Microsoft in conjunction with LucasArts and Disney.

185
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,680
So you know that whole Wii lightsaber game you've all been wanting for years and years?

186
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
Guess what?

187
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,640
Microsoft announces today, well inadvertently through USA Today, that Star Wars is actually

188
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
coming to Connect.

189
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,680
It's going to take me a little while to not say Natal anymore.

190
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
They should have just called the damn thing Natal, but that's alright.

191
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Connect.

192
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,240
Quickly, what are your thoughts about the name Connect?

193
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,560
Loki, we'll start with you, because you always have something elegant to say.

194
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,160
No, what's funny is they have, what is it, that Microsoft phone that's kin.

195
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,080
That's kind of ironic if you think about it.

196
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,280
And that's what you think of the name?

197
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,680
No, I think the Connect...

198
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
It's alright.

199
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,080
It is Move and Wii.

200
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,000
I mean, I don't know.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,360
It's slightly more original than Move.

202
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
The PlayStation Move.

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,040
I mean, that's just a really stupid name.

204
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Dark Sakura?

205
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Connect?

206
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,680
I played with Connects when I was a kid.

207
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I played Connect 4 when I was a kid.

208
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,820
Miek Latov, what do you think of Connect?

209
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
It's dumb.

210
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,400
Why do you say it's dumb?

211
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
Because.

212
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
We know Natal.

213
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,680
You know, that sounds kind of cool, futuristic, what they're kind of going for.

214
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Connect.

215
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Really?

216
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,880
Yeah, but see, remember, we all love the revolution, and you know.

217
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,400
And the Wii is still a stupid name.

218
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm not going to say it's not.

219
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Let's go to the chatters.

220
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Chat.orangelandtrady.com.

221
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
After all.

222
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,460
It's just a name.

223
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,480
It's the place where every gamer has a voice.

224
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,300
Sj100matt, you know we said the same thing when they came out with the Nintendo Revolution

225
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,320
before the Wii.

226
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,920
And I'm glad that they're coming out with this wonderful system, and they're totally

227
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,280
mimicking everything that's on the Wii already.

228
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,560
Okay, let's see.

229
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,160
We've got a game that's like Wii Sports.

230
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,720
We've got a game that's probably going to be like Wii Play.

231
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,880
And we've got a game that's just like Just Dance.

232
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,840
Oh, and we've got a game with Disney characters and Star Wars characters that will probably

233
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,080
be very similar to what's already on the Wii.

234
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Just with slightly better graphics.

235
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,440
Oh, and we have a racing game with a fake wheel.

236
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Ugh!

237
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,160
I mean, really, are we going to have the same shit on this stupid console?

238
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,400
Am I really going to pay the mythical $150 for this thing?

239
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Fool me once, Microsoft!

240
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,880
I already bought your fucking camera, and it served me no purpose whatsoever.

241
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Well, but you do get to use your picture as an icon.

242
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,320
Or, uh, gamer pic.

243
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
I don't care, that's the whole...

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
And Burnout!

245
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
The Burnout game.

246
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Remember?

247
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Oh, okay.

248
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,520
You get pictures of you when your car crashed, so you get pictures sent to strangers on the

249
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,400
internet where it looks like you're taking a poop.

250
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,560
Because you have these urgh faces.

251
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Alright, more chatter comments, because boy, they're being eloquent tonight.

252
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,760
Bochi Kawa in our chatroom.

253
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,720
Chat.orangewandredo.com, by the way, if you want to join us here live on this Sunday night

254
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,240
as we tape at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

255
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
It's 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

256
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,720
Bochi Kawa in our chatroom says, connect just won't connect to the consumer.

257
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,640
This is their get, basically their grab for the Wii Market.

258
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,880
Problem is, people in the Wii Market have a Wii, and they're not going to buy another

259
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,560
console to play the same fucking games.

260
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,040
I buy everything.

261
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,080
Tiger Kawa in our chat, you're special.

262
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,040
Tiger Kawa in our chat says one of the other games will probably be Connect the Dots.

263
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,760
Baconbit says the name doesn't matter as long as it's fun.

264
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,160
And BowerCTU says I'll call it shit, not connect.

265
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,560
How about kashit?

266
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Can we compromise here?

267
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Bower, kashit.

268
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,600
Listen, it'll be alright, but the problem, see, what I don't like is the first generation

269
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
of games.

270
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,080
Because the first generation of games is going to be like, ooh, look at what we can do with

271
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
the hardware.

272
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,920
It's going to take a while before we get some actual unique stuff.

273
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,860
And I'm not counting Fable 3 as unique crap, ok, that game is going to be the same damn

274
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
game again.

275
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,320
This was some other fancy shit, ok.

276
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
That's my problem with it.

277
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,960
Really, I mean, it'll probably be a good peripheral.

278
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,560
It's just, it's going to take a while to get there.

279
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Just like the Wii took a while to get there.

280
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,040
Alright, by the way, speaking of which, we got to razz Xbox over the name, I mean, I

281
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,720
hate if you want, but we did this with Nintendo when the Wii came out, I mean, how many Wii

282
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
jokes were made, right?

283
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Wii!

284
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
And all that stuff, right?

285
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
Let's see, more stuff in chat.

286
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
I love this.

287
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,120
Jesus Poppin Chat says, when I hear and say Natal, I think Xbox motion accessory, but

288
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,640
whenever I see Microsoft NATAL in print, or Microsoft Natal in print, I think of ultrasounds,

289
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,280
folic acid vitamins, and diaper genies.

290
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,600
I can see that.

291
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,640
Tiger Class says, watch, they will have cheesy taglines like, connect to the web.

292
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,960
They should have just called it the kinetic, I mean, because that would have been kind

293
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
of neat.

294
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,280
It would have, it would have at least sounded kind of fancy and stuff.

295
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,200
And I give them points, they're like one step above move.

296
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,000
Because move is just like, oh, what should we call this, I don't know, it's a control

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
you move around with.

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ah!

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Move!

300
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Good.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Done.

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They didn't even, like, think about a name.

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
Technus in our chat says, they might as well have named it Connect 3D, since 3D is the

304
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,280
new marketing term in the tech that it's based on.

305
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,960
SSG100 Matt says, the real question is, do they announce an Eye of Judgment game?

306
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,280
If so, do we care to make a bet on it?

307
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,240
And let's see, lastly, where were we at, oh yes, SSG100 Matt says, Connect, starring Jodie

308
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Foster.

309
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Spoiler alert, it's her father.

310
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Get it?

311
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
That's funny.

312
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
I believe that's contact.

313
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
That's funny.

314
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
That's funny!

315
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,320
I would like to say that that USA Today article that mentions, it's like, so you think you

316
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
can dance?

317
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,580
If anything, it'd be like America's Best Dance Crew, because that's on MTV, since it is being

318
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
made by MTV.

319
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,080
But they probably don't want to use the name, because if it's a crappy game, it might bring

320
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
down the show.

321
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
That's true.

322
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
And that show's actually pretty cool.

323
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Yeah.

324
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
So, so you think you can dance?

325
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I love that show.

326
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,560
Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into a little bit of the normal flow of our show,

327
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,900
but we thought we'd interrupt there for the breaking Xbox news.

328
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,840
We will keep you posted if anything else breaks during the conference.

329
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,520
Or if we think of any other funny connect jokes.

330
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,760
Special events featuring Cirque de French Gay.

331
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,140
Alright, let's move on with, how was your gaming week and the type of stuff you played

332
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,140
this week?

333
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,280
That's how we usually start the show, but you know, I can't control when the special

334
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,840
bulletins are gonna, just like when you're trying to watch Soaps, and then all of a sudden,

335
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
dead celebrity.

336
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,480
It's like when you've got bad gas.

337
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Yeah.

338
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
It just farts sometimes.

339
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Yeah.

340
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Maybe that'll be a game on Kinect.

341
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Kinect fart.

342
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,680
Alright, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

343
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,640
It was okay, um, I played some Star Trek Online, I hit Commander finally.

344
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Yay.

345
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,640
Um, I made a friend in Scotland.

346
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Did you?

347
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Yes.

348
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
If it's not Scottish, it's crap.

349
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:43,960
I played, um, and uh, I uh, I've been playing Sims 3 like I'm doing right now.

350
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
During the show.

351
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
It's slow.

352
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
During the show, well, what else is new?

353
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
No, it's, I know.

354
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
I know.

355
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm not playing Star Trek Online during the show and eating bandwidth.

356
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,240
True.

357
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,440
I turned off Steam for the show, Rob.

358
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
I'm very happy you did that.

359
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,080
I was enamored with watching everyone's Steam updates.

360
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,440
Oh yeah, I played some Portal.

361
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,320
Especially since I got it free.

362
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,600
Free is good.

363
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,920
Free is very good.

364
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,680
Alrighty, uh, let's move on to Loki.

365
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
How was your gaming week, Loki?

366
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,160
Uh, same old stuff again.

367
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,680
Um, Grand Theft Auto.

368
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:24,000
Mainly, I've been playing, um, just the regular Deathmatch stuff, but we have been having

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,320
some really serious connection problems, thanks to our wonderful bandwidth at work.

370
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,920
Uh, Red Dead Redemption, more co-op than that.

371
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,480
I think I'm like level 20 something now, like 23.

372
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,280
And Earth Defense Force, where most of the way through the Inferno difficulty.

373
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,320
And it's, uh, major fun.

374
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,480
Um, what else?

375
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,660
That's pretty much it.

376
00:15:49,660 --> 00:16:00,100
It's been mainly painting baby room and, um, you know, working on Grand Theft Auto IV editing.

377
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,840
It's Imagine Babies in real life, basically.

378
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,720
Well, it's game related.

379
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,240
The room is New Super Mario.

380
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Actually, and I don't know if the pictures are public or whatever, but they're really

381
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
cute.

382
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Like, a lot of the stuff that, um, you and the wife are doing are really cute.

383
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:19,400
Yeah, we got, um, big ol' stuffed animals of Koopas and, you know, the star and the

384
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,840
fire flower and, uh, stuff like that.

385
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,960
And then, of course, we have wall decals for the New Super Mario Brothers characters and

386
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,040
the bricks and question blocks and all that fun stuff.

387
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,520
So you totally took the idea of Dan and I wanted.

388
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Sorry.

389
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,000
Because now we need a Halo room.

390
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
A Halo room for your baby?

391
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Yeah.

392
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
I hope we have a girl.

393
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Nice.

394
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,280
Alright, uh, Miek LaTov, how was your gaming week?

395
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
What kind of games did you play this week?

396
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,320
It sucked because the one game I wanted to play, which was DJ Max Technica, we went to

397
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,920
go play it and it was the one game in the whole arcade that was not working.

398
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,840
That's even more of a surprise because only one game was not working.

399
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,280
And it was the best one, though, and it made me sad.

400
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,960
And I hate the people at Roseville Golf Land because they're idiots.

401
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,200
I hope they listen and know that they're dumb.

402
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,400
I loved it, too, because when Miek LaTov was kind of getting off the plane and he met Alan,

403
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,920
we went out to lunch when he first got here, because what was the first, what's the first

404
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,640
thing anyone wants to do when they come to California?

405
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,460
I was like, let's go eat and Miek LaTov wanted to go, too?

406
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
In and out.

407
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:26,920
Alright, so we went to In and Out and we were eating and Miek LaTov was like, I didn't come

408
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
here for E3.

409
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,180
I came here to play DJ Max Technica.

410
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
That's true.

411
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,800
So when we went to Roseville Golf Land last night and I looked and the machine was broken,

412
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I couldn't help but laugh.

413
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,680
Like, it was really funny.

414
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,600
It was a really depressing moment in my life.

415
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,560
I mean, sad, but...

416
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,440
And then the people would not sell me Technica cards, which they had.

417
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,560
I had to go up there three times to get them.

418
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,800
Finally, the guy just said, okay, and he's like, you know, these don't work because the

419
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
machine doesn't work.

420
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,200
I'm like, I understand that, but I'm giving you money to give me these cards.

421
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
And they did.

422
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,680
And I hate, like, 16-year-olds that work at arcades.

423
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,880
Couple questions is Arcade Infinity still open and couldn't you guys go there during

424
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
your...

425
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
That's a backup plan.

426
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Yes and yes.

427
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
That's already under discussion.

428
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm actually going to call them and be like, so do you have a working Technica machine?

429
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,960
Because other places don't.

430
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
You should.

431
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,040
And there was also an idea we could go to Sunnyvale Golf Land.

432
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,160
We don't think we can make it work with the timing because I have a family thing Saturday

433
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,460
I have to go to.

434
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,680
And Sunnyvale has Sirius, too, which would be fun to play, but maybe Arcade Infinity

435
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,000
might as well, since they used to be up on that stuff.

436
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Perhaps.

437
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't know.

438
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
All right.

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,640
Aren't they, like, almost closing now or something?

440
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,600
Aren't they, like, one of those Save the Arcades?

441
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Yeah.

442
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Yeah.

443
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
Sadly.

444
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,080
Surezo in chat says, Rob, I was there when he was there.

445
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Friday night.

446
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Miklotov was at RVGL.

447
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
I met him.

448
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Who?

449
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
Well, that's amazing because he was still in Kansas Friday night.

450
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah.

451
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,840
We both went on Saturday, actually.

452
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
That's so cool.

453
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,560
Like, it was me from the future, but in the past.

454
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,160
Unless he's getting his days mixed up, he could have been that guy, because there was

455
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
a guy playing BeatMania 2DX, who was pretty good.

456
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Yeah.

457
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
I met Miklotov, too.

458
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Hi.

459
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Hi.

460
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,880
It's a first in a couple years.

461
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
All right.

462
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,600
Anything else you played this week you want to mention?

463
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,040
Oh, on the plane, I was playing DJ Max because it's, like, the only game I play anymore.

464
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,840
And this old lady was sitting, like, two seats next to me, away from me, because we had an

465
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,280
empty seat in the middle, and she kept watching me play it, and it was really creepy because

466
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,940
she was, like, really old, like, 60 or 70.

467
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,400
And then she's talked to me, and I was like, whatever, I just want to play my game.

468
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,280
But she enjoyed DJ Max, kind of, over your shoulder?

469
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,760
Or being a creepy, stalker-y, per- I don't know.

470
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Old lady?

471
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Old lady.

472
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Yeah, that's what I said.

473
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
All right, there you go.

474
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Creepy.

475
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Did you have your first encounter with a cougar?

476
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Come here, little boy.

477
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
I have some candy.

478
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Oh, that is gross.

479
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,080
All right.

480
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,880
My gaming week, not quite as interesting as anyone else's.

481
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,240
Although I did go to a golf land with Mikolatov last night, and point laughed when the machine

482
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
was down.

483
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Although, not really.

484
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
I actually thought that was kind of crap.

485
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
You did laugh, though.

486
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,680
I did laugh, but it was one of those, like, that fucking sucks, laugh, like, you know.

487
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,680
But I played BeatMania, what is it they have there?

488
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Distorted.

489
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,800
What is that, 13, 14?

490
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
That's 13.

491
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Whatever.

492
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
When the music stopped getting good.

493
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Some teen.

494
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Yeah, some teen.

495
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,200
So, but I played a bunch of old songs, and I can surprisingly still pass, like, level

496
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
seven and eight songs.

497
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
I beat Daisuke.

498
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I was all like, woo!

499
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,040
It was like a 90, no, it was 94.

500
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,320
Daisuke was 90, wait, no, Thunder was 94.

501
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,120
Yeah, Thunder was 94.

502
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Good times.

503
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
Old school.

504
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
All right.

505
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,480
Uh, let's see, um, Osefer in chat is asking a good question.

506
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
What happened to you playing Final Fantasy 13?

507
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,600
That still is the plan to beat games, but unfortunately I got a little sidetracked because

508
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I've been playing WoW this week, too.

509
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,880
And then there's E3, and we've got to have work stuff going on, too.

510
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Um, played, like, a little bit of Game Room and realized that nothing has been coming

511
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
out in the past couple weeks.

512
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
Oh, yeah, we played Game Room.

513
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
That's part of the game.

514
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,320
Like, when you were playing that space pig game.

515
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
It's Oink!

516
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
It's not space pigs.

517
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Yes, it was.

518
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
It's a lizard.

519
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
It's a story based on the three little pigs.

520
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,780
It's pigs in space.

521
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,160
It's not pigs in space.

522
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,340
It's your captain, with your Doctor Strange pork.

523
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,880
It is not pigs in space.

524
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,040
They were up in a spaceship above the little, like, room you were in, and then the rat with

525
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
the long tongue kept trying to lick you.

526
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,320
That was the big, bad wolf.

527
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,380
He's blowing wind.

528
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,160
You had to imagine things a little bit better.

529
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,000
No, because if he's blowing wind, it wouldn't suck you in, too, because you don't, never

530
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
mind.

531
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,680
It was a mouse with a long tongue.

532
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
Alright.

533
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,800
And that was pretty much my gaming week.

534
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,960
Not a lot of exciting stuff outside of that, but, hey, on Black Wolf in Chat says, Oink

535
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
is awesome.

536
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,240
You all stop making fun of Oink right now.

537
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,880
I love Oink.

538
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,800
It's Miek Latov that is the hater.

539
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Haters to the left.

540
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,440
Yeah, I don't hate it, but I do, because it's really dumb.

541
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,600
Shut up.

542
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,200
But then you watched me play, what, Keystone Capers, which was the cops and robbers one.

543
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,440
That was also stupid.

544
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,140
And then I made you play Stampede.

545
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,440
Which was also really dumb.

546
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,800
You were on, like, the squid, trying to hit the dogs with the little line that comes out

547
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
of your hand.

548
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,400
I think, actually, Miek Latov should have a show where he just, like, describes old

549
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,700
Atari 2600 games, because- Oh, and then that one game where you're, like,

550
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,800
that bee that you attack the little, like, wall, and there's that colory rainbow thing

551
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,720
in the middle, and you had to watch out for- What are you even talking about?

552
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,480
The one that was made by the dude that makes E.T.

553
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Yars' Revenge.

554
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,800
Yes, that one.

555
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,160
I don't even know what he's talking about.

556
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,600
All right, we gotta move on with the show.

557
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,680
There's so much news tonight, it's really disgusting, so let's get to the show.

558
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,160
Housekeeping first, E3 overload this next week.

559
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,480
We will be coming to you, not live, but taped from E3, but the podcast will be up very quick.

560
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,700
I'm hoping we have reliable internet somewhere.

561
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,240
We're going to have to go to a Starbucks, I don't know, but there will be shows one

562
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,040
way or another, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night.

563
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Rob Roberts and Pals from E3, so unfortunately, Dark Soccer and Loki are not going to E3,

564
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,600
so it's not really Orange Laundrio, but Rob Roberts and Pals will bring you some specials

565
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
to the feed, and of course, Miek Latov, one of my pals, will be there every night.

566
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,320
I'm hoping that Bobby Blackwolf and whatever other pals I find in LA will also be there,

567
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,500
so there'll be lots of feed updates this week, so make sure you are subscribed to our feed

568
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,720
in iTunes, or whatever your favorite little podcatcher program is, so you don't miss anything.

569
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,040
This is also very important during housekeeping.

570
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,320
I have a bad feeling this is going to get forgotten a little bit amongst all the E3

571
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,960
hype that's going on right now, but I do want to mention, we talked about this a little

572
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,980
bit last week, but it is official, Orange Lounge Radio and our listenership will be

573
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,040
participating in the All Games Big Battle, the Big Battle, and if you want more information,

574
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,360
go to bigbattle.allgames.com, and you can actually go there, you can sign up to represent

575
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,000
Team Orange Lounge Radio, because this isn't about host vs host, this is listener vs listener,

576
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,400
and there are several teams, I'm sorry, several different competitions that you're going to

577
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
be able to do.

578
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,200
I know one of them was Pinball, those are the recently announced ones, those were just

579
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,520
announced a little earlier this week, where you can actually play either Zen Pinball on

580
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,880
the PS3, or the, what is it, Pinball FX on the 360.

581
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
Those games will be a part of this.

582
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,120
So Soldner X2, there's competition for that, and there is going to be a live competition

583
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,480
on June 26th, Battlefield Bad Company 2.

584
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,980
All that information is at bigbattle.allgames.com.

585
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,080
We will bring you a little more information on that this next week, after E3 settles down

586
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
a little bit.

587
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,480
The first competition I believe ends is the Soldner X2 one, and it ends on the 26th, so

588
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
we have a little time.

589
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,120
But if you want to get the jump on these competitions, go check it out, especially the Pinball ones.

590
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,460
I know we have some listeners that are good at Pinball.

591
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,920
There is no reason the Orange Lounge Radio should not destroy all of the other shows

592
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,160
participating in at least Pinball.

593
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,520
And Pinball is 2, there's 2, there's Pinball FX and Zen Pinball.

594
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,760
So we should have at least half these competitions right out the gate.

595
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,840
It got me excited there because I was reading this all of a sudden, it said, for PS3, Zen

596
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Pinball, Earth Defense Force.

597
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,040
I'm like, ooh, Earth Defense Force, I will win at that.

598
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,520
But no, unfortunately it's not.

599
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,720
I am trying to get Derek to put Grand Theft Auto IV as one of the games.

600
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
But we'll see.

601
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,880
It would be kind of tough, and it has to be Episodes of Liberty City because that's a

602
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
better game.

603
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
We'll see, we'll see.

604
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,400
Alright, we'll talk more about that next week, not to belittle the importance of the event,

605
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,420
but just with E3 going on, I just think everybody's going to forget.

606
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,320
It's going to get kind of lost amongst all the E3 madness, but we will be kind of giving

607
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,640
you regular updates on what's going on there starting next week.

608
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,520
So again, sign up now, get the jump on everything, read all about it, bigbattle.allgames.com.

609
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,600
Let's see, what else is going on right now that I want to tell you guys about?

610
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,960
The anniversary show for Orange Lounge Radio is coming up in two weeks, so next Sunday

611
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,600
we will be live, it's our post-E3 show, then we will be here for the anniversary show of

612
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,680
Orange Lounge Radio, which will be on the 2014 days from tonight, so the 27th, and then

613
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,440
after that is July 4th.

614
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,680
We will not be live on July 4th due to the holiday, people want to go set things on fire

615
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
instead of sitting here on the radio.

616
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,240
Yes, so we will not be here July 4th, but that's okay, because it's going to be a busy

617
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
busy busy next few weeks.

618
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,120
We will have beer and exploding things.

619
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,440
Alright, let's, I guess, let's get into some gaming news.

620
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,600
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, Twitter.com slash OLR, add us, follow us on the net,

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,040
so great, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

623
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,160
Let's get into some actual, what?

624
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,680
Don't forget Geek Life.

625
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,040
Yes, Geek-Life.com, our BFF website, who I will be doing my first story for next week.

626
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,200
What could it possibly be about?

627
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,680
I don't know.

628
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,520
I have my regular segment on there, which is Geek Cube, integrating your geek life with

629
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
your office life.

630
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Good times.

631
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Very geeky.

632
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,920
Alright, Dark Sakura is going to start us tonight with, start us off tonight with some

633
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
gaming news.

634
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,040
What's up, Dark Sakura?

635
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:00,760
Keytar Hero, I mean, Rock Band 3.

636
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:07,520
The Keytar is official for Rock Band 3, it is going to be either something you can play

637
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,640
as a horizontal keyboard or over the shoulder, it has like this little handle, you know,

638
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:18,520
very keytar-like, and it looks like a two-octave keyboard, it looks very keyboard mania-like.

639
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,400
25 keys, I think.

640
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
Yeah, two octave.

641
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,600
Yay, it's not a keytar, yay, yay, yay, I mean, you could stand it upright and it could be

642
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,040
a guitar, but it's an actual bonafide keyboard, I love you, harmonics.

643
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,240
So yeah, there's that in the hyper guitar.

644
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,320
Did you see that thing?

645
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
The hyper guitar.

646
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,960
What is that, like the 120-button one?

647
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,760
The 120 fret with strings.

648
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,840
Well, now they want to teach you how to really play.

649
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,280
But I kind of want it.

650
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,040
You know what, I didn't care about any of it, because keyboards, and Bohemian Rhapsody,

651
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,960
and the cool thing is, if you play in pro mode, and you play the expert level, and if

652
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,240
you can memorize what you're doing, you will be able to play the actual, real song.

653
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
That is the great thing about this.

654
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
In two octaves.

655
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Yes.

656
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,640
The only thing that I thought was a little weird was when you look at the video, the

657
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,680
pro mode note chart kind of scrolls to the right and to the left.

658
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,360
You don't see it all on the screen at once.

659
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,760
I think that's actually kind of cool.

660
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,080
I think it's supposed to tell you when to move your hands around.

661
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,120
I think that's what the point is, but I'm a little apprehensive about it.

662
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,860
Well, it's limited screen space is basically it, because you can't have like 25 rows on

663
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:32,360
there at one time, so what they do is, as the song shifts octaves or whatever, it will

664
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,560
scroll over.

665
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Which is fine by me.

666
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
It looks pretty awesome.

667
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,280
I was wondering how they'd be able to pull it off, and it looks like you can do it.

668
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,560
Now, what I want to see is how the hell they're going to do the guitar part of the pro mode,

669
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,480
because that's going to be weird.

670
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,040
You know, Tigerclaw is in our chat right now, and he said the same thing.

671
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,220
I was just thinking, Sky, it's an actual keyboard you can plug into your computer and use as

672
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
a MIDI keyboard.

673
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,440
That just makes it like 10 times more awesome.

674
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,600
More awesomer.

675
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,360
And you can actually get a MIDI adapter to plug into any MIDI guitars, drums, or keyboards

676
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,560
that you may have as well, and use those in Rock Band.

677
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,960
So what do you guys think of Rock Band 3 so far from this news we're hearing?

678
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,560
Keytar Hero.

679
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
I am so excited.

680
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,780
Bohemian Rhapsody and Power of Love.

681
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,080
There were some other songs they announced too.

682
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,240
I don't have the whole list in front of me, but it looks like it's going to be a pretty

683
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
solid list.

684
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,720
Lots of newer stuff, but some of the old stuff too for fun.

685
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,720
Alright, we're going to get to our next news story, but first, guys, I can't control tonight.

686
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:46,600
There is just so much breaking news!

687
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,760
The Tony for Best Mute, no I'm kidding, actually we're going to go to Miek Latov with a special

688
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
report.

689
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,080
Um, yeah, apparently those rumors about a new 360 appear true.

690
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,280
It looks like they are redesigning the 360, and it will come with a 250GB hard drive,

691
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:10,480
but most importantly, built-in Wi-Fi, so you don't have to pay $100 to be able to connect

692
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,020
to the internet if you don't have a very long ethernet cable.

693
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,200
And it comes with a fork and a knife and a clock and a pillow.

694
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
That would be great, actually.

695
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,800
Then you could sleep on your 360.

696
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,280
No name for this yet, though, right?

697
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
No, and...

698
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Like, foreign ads?

699
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
This is all leaking from foreign...

700
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,520
Yeah, they're Italian, it looks like.

701
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,960
Can we trust the Italians, I don't know.

702
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
They're dirty.

703
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
But it looks really cool.

704
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,040
It's very sleek, not so much slim.

705
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,360
And it looks like it could poke your eye out, because it's also very pointy.

706
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,560
They also changed, of course, since it is going to be slimmer, very similar to what

707
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,020
they were showing in those leaked motherboard development unit pictures.

708
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,000
It's basically now going to be all integrated into one chip instead of having a separate

709
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,520
GPU, CPU, and they're going to have the ventilation on it cooling straight out above the chip

710
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,660
instead of going through this ductwork that they had in there.

711
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,760
So that's kind of neat.

712
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,800
I do want to tell you guys, I guarantee you it is not called the 360 Slim.

713
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,560
It's only being called that because we're used to this kind of redesign thing from Sony's

714
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
end.

715
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
It's not called the Slim.

716
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,680
Microsoft will call this something else, which we'll hear tomorrow.

717
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
The 360 Cinched.

718
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Yes.

719
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
That's what it looks like.

720
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,040
The 360 Slightly Smaller.

721
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Or the 180.

722
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Connect.

723
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,560
It might not even get a new name, though.

724
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,640
I mean, you can come out with a new system design and still call it the same thing.

725
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,640
That's true.

726
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
They might just call it the Xbox 360.

727
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,640
It might just...

728
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,400
When they redesigned the old, old Nintendo to be top-loading or whatever, it didn't have

729
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
a different design.

730
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Or a different name.

731
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,960
We've already heard about the fact that Microsoft kind of wants to reboot the system and include

732
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,200
Natal, excuse me, Kinect, as a part of the new system.

733
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Guarantee it.

734
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,960
There will be bundles on the shelves this Christmas with the pointy 360 with Wi-Fi and

735
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,360
Kinect all in one box with Kinect Sports or Kinect Kitties or whatever that game was.

736
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,160
One of those BS games all together for the low, low price of $250, we'll say.

737
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Let's hope.

738
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
$300, I bet you.

739
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
$300?

740
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,880
That sounds more realistic, perhaps.

741
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,160
And then they'll also sell Netflix or whatever else they're going to announce tomorrow, whether

742
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,480
it be Hulu or anything else.

743
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
So we'll see.

744
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
All right.

745
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Let's get back into the regular news.

746
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,980
Thank you for that special report, Miklotov.

747
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
We should...

748
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,320
We're going to need you to...

749
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,400
Maybe we should have you.

750
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,000
I mean, I know you're in Kansas.

751
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,640
Do they have internet there?

752
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,200
I have a tin can I hook up to my computer.

753
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I see.

754
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,800
Well, the tornadoes aren't blaring, right?

755
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Tornadoes don't blare.

756
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,800
That's the sirens that blare.

757
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Tornadoes spin.

758
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
They're coming.

759
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Okay.

760
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,760
So if the tornado doesn't knock out your connection, you might have to call us once in a while

761
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
with your breaking news.

762
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
With my breaking news?

763
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Yes.

764
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,600
I'll be like, I just played a retro game on Xbox Live Game Room.

765
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,320
It was stupid.

766
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
Breaking news.

767
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,320
Yes.

768
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
Actually, I can...

769
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,560
Let's fast forward to next week or next week.

770
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:14,520
Miklotov will call in live to the show and it will go something like this.

771
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Yes.

772
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,760
It looks like that Miklotov is calling into the show.

773
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,960
He's calling in with some breaking news.

774
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,920
Let's go live to Miklotov and see what is going on in gaming news.

775
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Miklotov.

776
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:41,680
I'm sorry, apparently there's been a takeover of our feed from Understation Live.

777
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,600
I don't know what that is all about, but that just wasn't funny.

778
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
All right.

779
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
Let's move on.

780
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,560
Loki, do you have some gaming news for us?

781
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Yes.

782
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,000
It's regarding rumors about the 3DS.

783
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,880
Apparently there's reports out saying that the system is more powerful than the Wii,

784
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,160
and unlike it was previously thought, it will not be using the new Nvidia chips.

785
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,960
Apparently, both IGN and Eurogamer have been reporting that developers have set off the

786
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,600
record, which is funny because they're reporting on it, so if it was off the record wouldn't

787
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,880
it be not reported on because that would be on the record.

788
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,440
That the handheld won't use the Nvidia Tegra chip.

789
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:29,120
Also Eurogamer is saying that the 3DS hardware is internally known as CTR, suggesting that

790
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,960
the motherboard image submitted to the FCC in May, which showed CTR as a code name, was

791
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
indeed the 3DS.

792
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,960
One of the things that's kind of interesting, Kotaku, I know, posted a mock-up of what they

793
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,140
thought the 3DS would look like based off of what they saw on the hardware thing.

794
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,260
It's funny that they didn't really pick up on the analog nub that was on there since

795
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,080
it looks exactly like the analog nub on the PSP.

796
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,880
But yes, it will have an analog nub on there.

797
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:00,480
Of course, the top screen's gonna be a widescreen, bottom screen not widescreen.

798
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,000
Of course, they're gonna have some sort of toggle on there to adjust how much 3D is on

799
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
there, I guess.

800
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,600
You can adjust, I guess, the depth field or whatever.

801
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,920
And according to IGN also, they're saying that several developers have experienced 3DS

802
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,240
in its current form and have reported off the record that its processing capabilities

803
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,480
far exceed the Nintendo Wii and bring the device up with abilities that are close to

804
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,960
the HD console, such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

805
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,660
If that's the case, thank God Nintendo, you finally did something right and actually put

806
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,160
out a console that has better tech than what's already out there instead of saying, well,

807
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,080
it's not gonna be about technology, it's gonna be about the gameplay.

808
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Because guess what?

809
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Now the gameplay's all the same.

810
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,840
So it's gotta be about the tech now.

811
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,960
Now it's gonna be kind of weird to see what the Wii's gonna do with all these new motion

812
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,680
controllers and stuff like that now that, you know, they're kind of on an even playing

813
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
field.

814
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,680
It kind of intrigues me that a handheld system could possibly be as powerful as some of the

815
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
stuff that's in our living room.

816
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,800
I mean, it makes sense.

817
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:15,060
The technology, I mean, this cycle of video games really has lasted longer than I think

818
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,560
a lot of people have expected it to.

819
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,480
And you remember they came out and said, PlayStation 3's gonna have a 10-year life cycle, 360's

820
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,080
gonna have these long life cycles.

821
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,680
And it seems to really be happening because usually we should be hearing about new consoles

822
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,180
this year at E3, but that's not gonna happen.

823
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,000
And I don't know if you wanna blame the economy or the investment on these or what, I don't

824
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
really know.

825
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,140
But the point is, you know, these consoles are still there and the technology's a little

826
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
bit old.

827
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,680
It's interesting to me, though, that now the handhelds have already caught up because I

828
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,120
think a lot of us also kind of think, oh, well, Nintendo, let's see, the Advance was

829
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,440
basically a Super Nintendo, the DS was basically a Nintendo 64.

830
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,960
So logically, the next system is basically a GameCube, and then again, the Wii is also

831
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,360
kind of basically a GameCube, isn't it?

832
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,400
And they also usually do improve it like a little bit, right?

833
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,080
Am I crazy?

834
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,520
They kind of like, you know, it would be improved like a little bit.

835
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,320
Like, the DS felt like a little more than just a Nintendo 64, is it just me?

836
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,360
But they need a new gimmick because, I mean, if you wanna play touch screen games now,

837
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,360
you mean you have the iPhone, you have the iPad?

838
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:28,760
You know, it's not really any more, I mean, they're not the unique game system out there

839
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
anymore.

840
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,760
And now, with, you know, this new system, now that they have 3D, no other system's doing

841
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,000
that right now unless, you know, PlayStation announces a new PSP, which will be 3D as well,

842
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,280
because I'm sure that they will try to do something like that.

843
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,680
And it'll be digital downloads only, because it's an experiment.

844
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,000
We'll get to that in a little bit.

845
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,140
Let's do some comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

846
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,280
Jay Dizzle wants you all to know he's connecting on the toilet right now.

847
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,760
Tigerclaw says, you know, don't be surprised if Sony announces the PSP2 with 3D support

848
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,640
if you buy the 3D add-on glasses, which will probably be their way to counter the 3DS.

849
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,960
Hm, I don't know.

850
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
S.H.G.O.

851
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,600
100 Matt says, so this is a confirmed rumor?

852
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,320
Stop talking to us in riddles and oxymorons, dammit!

853
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,480
Bochikawa says, this might be a good move for Nintendo, putting their cards in the mobile

854
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,380
market and selling the Wii or predecessors to soccer moms and six-year-olds.

855
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,740
It's actually really not a bad strategy.

856
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,560
It's been working for them so far.

857
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Why not?

858
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

859
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:31,480
Here's my problem, and you're gonna hate this, but my problem with Nintendo is I don't think

860
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:35,320
they know how to deal with new hardware as far as, like, advanced stuff, because if you

861
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,640
notice, you know, what were some of the games that we got when the Wii came out?

862
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
GameCube ports.

863
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,600
You know, what are some of the games that we got on, you know, the Nintendo DS, basically

864
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,720
ports of stuff that was on Nintendo 64 and that kind of stuff?

865
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Are they really gonna-

866
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,960
See, I was about to jump in there and say, but OMG, the Zelda game!

867
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
It was amazing!

868
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,600
And then, oh yeah, there was a GameCube version of that.

869
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Exactly!

870
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,440
It was a GameCube port, and, you know, granted they're gonna have this wonderful new shiny

871
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,440
hardware and they're gonna be able to do really amazing stuff, but it won't come right away.

872
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,560
It's gonna be, oh look, we were working on this game for the DS, but now that we have

873
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,360
the 3DS, you know, let's just port it over and it'll be in 3D, but the graphics will

874
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
be really simple.

875
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,240
I have a crazy thought.

876
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,160
Really crazy- super crazy thought, you guys.

877
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,720
Here's my crazy thought.

878
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,260
We know that there's a new Zelda game that's supposed to be coming at E3 this year, right?

879
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,440
And that it's supposed to be, like, a better looking type of game.

880
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,720
It's gonna be, you know, kind of specially designed and da da da da, it's gonna be Uber

881
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
and all that stuff.

882
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,880
What if the Zelda game is actually a 3DS game?

883
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,040
Well, I'm sure they will have a 3DS Zelda game, but I think it's actually gonna be on

884
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
the Wii.

885
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Right.

886
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,640
I'm most worried about the screen size now, the rumored screen size to be the size of

887
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,680
the, like, DSi screens, because I picked up an XL because I'm a Nintendo horror, at least

888
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,880
in the handheld sense, and I can't go back.

889
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,560
I mean, that screen really does not lose that much resolution in my opinion, and it'd be

890
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,240
really nice to have another system with screens that big.

891
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,360
I wanna point out, too, Miklotov is actually in the studio right now wearing a 1UP beanie,

892
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
so he's not lying.

893
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,120
And I'm not talking about that website, I'm talking about the actual 1UP mushroom.

894
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Yes.

895
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,120
There it is.

896
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Very nice.

897
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,240
Speaking of rumored games that are coming out for the 3DS, Destructoid has ran a story.

898
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,360
According to their sources, they strongly believe that Nintendo has been getting the

899
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,960
developers and publishers over with the 3D demo of Animal Crossing, apparently as an

900
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,920
internal demo that they're showing off to developers to try and get people over, that

901
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,960
that is the game that's supposed to be revealed this next week as a launch title for the Nintendo

902
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,440
3DS.

903
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,800
Nintendo went back into a corner and said, uh, comment on this, dammit, has said, Nintendo

904
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,480
does not comment on rumors or speculation.

905
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,080
Listen, Nintendo, if you're putting out another Animal Crossing game, I'm not fucking buying

906
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
it.

907
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
You know why?

908
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,400
It's because the last two games you've put out have been exactly the same as the first

909
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,680
one except with less features.

910
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,040
So go fuck yourself with your fucking Animal Crossing, because I am-

911
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,480
What if, hold on, anger, angry man, angry man sitting over there in the chair.

912
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Hold on.

913
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,880
What if they've actually made changes?

914
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
They won't.

915
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,400
They've actually made changes.

916
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:19,160
What if, what if, stay with me here, hell had ice in it, and if you would put it kindly,

917
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
froze over.

918
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,760
Especially if you read the Inferno, the core of hell is icy.

919
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,920
Yes but the hell that Nintendo's familiar with, you know, does not have ice in it.

920
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,360
Um, no, I'm sorry, I, the only thing I can see them doing is adding 3D to it.

921
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,980
It's really gonna be the same fucking game all over again.

922
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,980
They might add a new fruit.

923
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,980
Oh, there you go.

924
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,980
A new fruit!

925
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,980
That would make people buy it.

926
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,240
And then they take out, like, your villagers and put them in the city now because, you

927
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
know, that's-

928
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,320
What if, wait, what if, what if, what if, stay with me here, what if, what if they gave

929
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,280
the animals machine guns?

930
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,440
Never forget.

931
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,080
They will never give them machine guns.

932
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,480
They'll give them squirt guns.

933
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Paintball.

934
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,160
That, you know, set, paintball would be cool.

935
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,120
Question, question, question, question, question.

936
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,600
What was the best part about Animal Crossing when you would play it for the first time?

937
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,320
Hitting the, the people with, like, the net.

938
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,760
Terrorizing the animals in your village, correct?

939
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,600
Digging holes around them so they couldn't move.

940
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
Exactly.

941
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:37,640
What if Nintendo made a game that was nothing but terrorizing your villagers in Animal Crossing?

942
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,600
So they're gonna bring the Sims to the DS?

943
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,640
And they'll walk out and they'll walk back in their house.

944
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,080
Like, I, I realize, and you know what Dark Soccer used to do?

945
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,480
She would make gay pride flags and put them outside of people's houses.

946
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,720
Because I had a lesbian in my town.

947
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,120
I had, I had the, the chick that was the, had the PE room, the, the, was she a duck?

948
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
I don't know.

949
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Or something.

950
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
I get it, they just replaced, like, a letter.

951
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:07,760
But, but she, but she was, but she was wearing sweats and had PE equipment and we, and she

952
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,160
would ask questions that could be taken the wrong way.

953
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,200
So we put a big rainbow sign outside of her house and she was her town lesbian and then

954
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,200
she moved to Rocktown.

955
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,480
Hold on, hold on, this is great.

956
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,080
Give me a gold star stat, because a chatter just won a gold star here.

957
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,240
Give me a gold star stat for this comment.

958
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,000
BowerCTU says, Animal Double Crossing.

959
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Love it.

960
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Love it!

961
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,040
Reggie, you listening?

962
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,840
They seriously need to redesign the game, I mean, and stop being so damn stingy with

963
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,080
your fucking virtual console crap or, you know, your Nintendo classics.

964
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,840
Put them in there.

965
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Come on.

966
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,360
You're not selling them on the market.

967
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,480
Yeah, well, you might with the 3DS.

968
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,480
Oh, stay tuned.

969
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
You know.

970
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,880
That's what we thought with the I, and that never happened.

971
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,680
So I mean, come on.

972
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,560
It's not gonna steal away sales from the Wii.

973
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,280
It's just gonna be really kick-ass.

974
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,760
And you know what you can do?

975
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:05,120
You can sell your wonderful virtual console games as downloadable, you know, content for

976
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,240
Animal Crossing.

977
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:14,800
There's a thought, but it would be a creative thought and embracing digital content and

978
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,800
online.

979
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,240
Something Nintendo does not do.

980
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,760
It's the scariest thing in the world to them.

981
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,440
This is gonna be an interesting E3.

982
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,920
Everybody's kinda punchy in studio tonight.

983
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,920
I kinda like this.

984
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,920
It's fun.

985
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,680
God, just think about the show.

986
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,360
Alright, more news.

987
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,640
I'm done with this 3DS thing until I get to see it.

988
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,240
I will say, the plan right now in quotes, unless something like super awesome is revealed

989
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,120
in the next couple days that we decide we have to see on the show floor.

990
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,400
Miklotov and I plan to go run and see the 3DS first.

991
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I won't run.

992
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,600
I might walk a little fast.

993
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,620
We'll walk at an accelerated pace.

994
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,880
I'm kinda old.

995
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:00,480
So we'll walk with a cane at an accelerated pace towards the 3DS line over at Nintendo.

996
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,760
Because the thought is, everybody's still gonna be at Sony's press conference.

997
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,580
So we wanna do the 3DS thing first.

998
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,080
So we're hoping that'll be on the first show Tuesday night, Rob Roberts and Pals.

999
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,360
Alright, Loki, let's do something besides the 3DS.

1000
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
What you got for us?

1001
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,960
Well, let's see.

1002
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,480
The PSP Go apparently was an experiment, according to Sony.

1003
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:28,280
They're claiming that the experiment, or one of the reasons that they launched the PSP

1004
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,840
Go, was to understand where consumer behavior was going.

1005
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:38,440
We were getting signals from consumers that this was the kind of device that they wanted.

1006
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:46,780
But we need to recognize that the consumers like packaged media.

1007
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,000
That sounds like a poor excuse for the reason why your console failed.

1008
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,600
Not because your console was, I don't know, $80 more than, say, the same console that

1009
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:05,440
had media already, basically had all the same features, except the ability to actually buy

1010
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,740
disc-based games and be able to sell those games back when you're done with them.

1011
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,920
If you really wanted to know where your consumer behavior was, put out a fucking survey!

1012
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,720
You don't need to create a new console.

1013
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,760
It was a failure, and that's what it was.

1014
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,320
You're not calling it an experiment, it was a failure.

1015
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,280
Huh.

1016
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,280
I don't know, it's just kind of one of those, like, boy, they ran away with their tail between

1017
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,280
its legs.

1018
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,440
That's it, is this kind of like an official confirmation, you think, of the fact that

1019
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,080
it's a done deal and the PSP Go is no longer going to be sold?

1020
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:43,540
I mean, what's the deal?

1021
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,540
I don't know.

1022
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,880
Have you heard anything about this getting pulled from Shells?

1023
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,520
No, I haven't heard anything, but let me put it this way, I mean, they haven't really been

1024
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,840
selling like hotcakes, I mean, at all.

1025
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,200
I mean, what do you expect?

1026
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,500
You're putting out a console to your retailers and you're saying, oh, by the way, your customers

1027
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,920
aren't going to be able to buy any sort of software for this from you, so.

1028
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,800
But you can sell our console for us, oh, by the way, you're not going to make any money

1029
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,880
off those consoles because consoles have no markup whatsoever, so yeah, go ahead and sell

1030
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:14,920
this for no sort of profit whatsoever and then you're not going to profit for it later

1031
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,920
on.

1032
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,640
Most consumers or retailers out there are going to go, uh, how about fuck you and I'm

1033
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,520
just going to carry the regular PSP where I can sell the same games.

1034
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:30,560
And by the way, not all the games were available digitally right away anyways, so what's the

1035
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,120
point?

1036
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,240
And that's the problem is they pissed everybody off.

1037
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,240
It was also more expensive than the PSP was, which made no fucking sense whatsoever.

1038
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:45,940
Um, so it was just a bad, bad plan altogether.

1039
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,840
You should have charged less for it since it didn't have, you know, UMD drive and it

1040
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,360
would have gotten people to actually maybe pick it up.

1041
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,040
But there's really absolutely, or actually there was absolutely no reason whatsoever

1042
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,560
to pick up a PSP Go because you could just buy a PSP 3000 and a memory unit and have

1043
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,760
basically the exact same thing and the flexibility to either buy your games on disk or buy them

1044
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
via digital download.

1045
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,800
Oh, I missed all the PSP hate and I hate it too, the Go.

1046
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,360
Um, I thought it was dumb.

1047
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,880
Uh, I'll share a quick little story.

1048
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,360
At the store I work at, which I'm sure I can't name or get fired, um, we have sold, I kid

1049
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,640
you not, since the system came out, three.

1050
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,760
Just three.

1051
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,960
And I talked everybody that I could out of it because, I mean, like you're saying, a

1052
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,000
PSP 3000 with a, you know, a decent sized memory stick.

1053
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,240
Just as good and way better actually than the Go could ever be.

1054
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,680
Well, you know, if you buy the Sony memory sticks then maybe it might be somewhat of

1055
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,480
a good deal, but since everybody doesn't, you know, double the retail price of their

1056
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,560
memory units, um, you could go buy a third party SanDisk memory stick and it'd be just

1057
00:48:54,560 --> 00:49:00,760
fine, uh, and that's assuming if you wanted to download all your damn games, which most

1058
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,200
people are not gonna do that because you can buy a PSP game on disk and when you're done

1059
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,560
with it, guess what?

1060
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,160
You could sell it and make your money back.

1061
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,120
Don't forget about our friend who has had all the trouble with his downloads too.

1062
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,360
Yeah, I have no problem with those digital download games that are only available via

1063
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:23,080
digital download, but guess what, the PSP 3000, you can also download those.

1064
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,720
Um, they just were trying to make it seem like that the PSP Go was the only system able

1065
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,520
to access this marketplace and the problem was they were trying to, you know, basically

1066
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,720
compete with like the iPhone or something like that, but you kind of have to have those

1067
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:42,720
types of features in there like GPS and, you know, an actual phone, um, you know, all that

1068
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,080
stuff to be able to compete in that market.

1069
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,340
You didn't, so why even try putting on a new damn console anyways?

1070
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:53,200
If you haven't improved anything, in fact, actually removed functionality out of it.

1071
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,720
Have you ever actually held one?

1072
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
No.

1073
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,860
Okay, they feel like plastic little toys.

1074
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,000
They are awful.

1075
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,520
You feel like you're gonna break it.

1076
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,120
Just that top screen alone does not feel very secure.

1077
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,160
So when you're sliding it up and down, I can only imagine that it won't last, like it will

1078
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,160
break.

1079
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:16,000
Um, quickly, kind of one big rumor, big, big rumor that's floating around about what we're

1080
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
gonna hear in a couple days, namely Tuesday morning when Sony does their press conference,

1081
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,880
we may hear something about a PSP 2.

1082
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,160
Do you think there's any truth to that rumor?

1083
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,000
I think if it's gonna come out, it's gonna come out probably around the same time frame

1084
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,400
as Gran Turismo 3, which means, uh, in a few years.

1085
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,680
You mean Gran Turismo 5?

1086
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
Whatever.

1087
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,960
5-3, it doesn't matter.

1088
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
At first...

1089
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,000
The game isn't coming up this year, that's what it matters.

1090
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,920
At first, I was like, no, they're not doing it.

1091
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:51,720
But now that I'm hearing this whole disavowing of the PSP go, it makes a lot more sense that

1092
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,720
that could be where they're going.

1093
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,600
3 is the number of Forza games that'll be out before Gran Turismo 5.

1094
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,600
Alright.

1095
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,840
And I mean, additional Forza games.

1096
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,280
Beyond the third one we've already had, 2 and 3.

1097
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,600
I like my PSP, I think the PSP is like a pretty good system.

1098
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,980
It was lacking in games for a while, I mean, yeah, Luminous was cool, but it was really

1099
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,360
lacking in games for a while, but then it started getting, like, some real kick butt

1100
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,360
stuff.

1101
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,520
Especially with the Final Fantasy games were re-released for it, and you know, it had some

1102
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,520
good stuff.

1103
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,520
But I gotta be honest, though, even with just the regular PSP, it's not been doing great.

1104
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:29,960
I mean, even just talking to my retailers about bringing a PSP title, they're really

1105
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:36,160
just bringing in some that have them on the shelf, but it's not, you know, a big representation.

1106
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,440
And that's kinda hurting them.

1107
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,000
They really need, especially now with the 3DS, I mean, people are gonna be like, whatever,

1108
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,960
I'm not buying anything on the PSP.

1109
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,180
So they gotta come out with something new.

1110
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,280
Is it gonna be out this year?

1111
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,320
I highly doubt it.

1112
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,240
Osfer brings up Valkyria Chronicles 2, that looks like it might be pretty cool.

1113
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,400
Yeah, the Phantasy Star Portable 2 is also coming, which is somewhat big to people I

1114
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,400
know.

1115
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,480
AlphaCadandagram in our chatroom is mentioning that there is a giant Kevin Butler E3 banner,

1116
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
apparently at the convention center right now.

1117
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,760
Actually, I need to say something since you mentioned Phantasy Star Portable.

1118
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:16,680
My friend Krista, if you go on Sega's website and look at the contests that they did for

1119
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,000
doing fan art, she won third place doing pixel-style art of the characters.

1120
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,720
So congratulations to Krista.

1121
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,720
Congrats to you.

1122
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,720
What does she win?

1123
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,720
Copy the game.

1124
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,280
Well, hey, that's something.

1125
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,320
Free stuff is good.

1126
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,760
Alright.

1127
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:38,560
Moving on to some other news about Kingdom Hearts.

1128
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,240
Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts has got a new game announced at E3, but it's not the big

1129
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,240
number 3.

1130
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,800
It is Kingdom Hearts Re-Coded.

1131
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,360
There was a rumor about this on last week's show, it does look like it is official.

1132
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,280
Kingdom Hearts Re-Coded is coming out for the DS, it's by the same people that were

1133
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:59,600
behind 358 slash 2 days, and it will be on the show floor at E3, and apparently is going

1134
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,960
to be a remake of the Japanese mobile game Kingdom Hearts Coded.

1135
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,880
Just like they did with Chains of Memories, remember?

1136
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,080
Kingdom Hearts Re-Chains of Memories?

1137
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,360
Yes.

1138
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,680
No word on the release date yet, we don't know if it's going to be this year or next,

1139
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:18,440
hopefully this Christmas, but it will be about Sora retracing his steps through the original

1140
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,880
Kingdom Hearts.

1141
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,240
Jiminy Cricket apparently is looking over the journal he used to document his first

1142
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,520
adventure with Sora, and he discovers a mysterious message.

1143
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,520
Interesting.

1144
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,800
So, it's not something he wrote, so how did it get there?

1145
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,960
I don't know.

1146
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,000
Sounds confusing, just like the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

1147
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,880
Which I roll my eyes to.

1148
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,880
Why?

1149
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,720
Because, Kingdom Hearts is not that great.

1150
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,720
It's just kind of boring.

1151
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,720
I think it's pretty cool.

1152
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,720
Was the message, uh, sitting on the toilet?

1153
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,720
Shut up.

1154
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,920
Alright, uh, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1155
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,280
Jamie, you got something for us?

1156
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,280
I have nuts.

1157
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,280
Me too.

1158
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:03,080
This one is actually about our good friends at Capcom.

1159
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,800
It's um, what's it, they're an E3 lineup and I'm pretty excited.

1160
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,040
Marvel vs Capcom 3 Fate of Two Worlds, which, by the way, I saw the last trailer, and it

1161
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,080
has Deadpool and Dante, and that made me very squee.

1162
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:22,920
Um, Okami Den, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes, Ghost Trick

1163
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:30,880
Phantom Detective, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 2K0, MotoGP 910.

1164
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,000
So it sounds like Capcom's booth is going to be pretty hopping.

1165
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,900
I really hope Marvel vs Capcom 3 is playable.

1166
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,080
Take me lots of pictures and get me lots of swag.

1167
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,080
I will.

1168
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,080
I really want to play it.

1169
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,080
I want Deadpool stuff.

1170
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,800
I will play as Deadpool just for you.

1171
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,800
You better.

1172
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,800
Alright.

1173
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,800
And he'll be terrible.

1174
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,680
Yeah I will, because I'm terrible at Marvel vs Capcom.

1175
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,280
But Deadpool has guns.

1176
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,280
And snark.

1177
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,280
Actually that's not true, when I played at that retro arcade a couple weeks ago in Portland,

1178
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,960
I just kind of button mashed and I did pretty good.

1179
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,400
All I, you just do, you know, it's all Street Fighter moves, like quarter circle forward

1180
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,200
and back and forward, you know, it's all Street Fighter moves, you just do a bunch of Street

1181
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,080
Fighter moves and then your characters are going, whoa, how do we get back?

1182
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,920
I hope that's not the final list for Capcom, I hope they have a few more games than just

1183
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,920
that.

1184
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,920
There might be some surprises.

1185
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,920
I always see Dead Rising 2 real bad too.

1186
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,000
I wonder what Dead Rising 2K0 is.

1187
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,400
I don't follow up on Dead Rising 2, it's probably the Wii port.

1188
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,400
No, K0.

1189
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
3DS port.

1190
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,600
K0 is the sort of demo for the game, it's basically going to be a downloaded game that

1191
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,760
you have to pay for, that's like a prequel to Dead Rising 2.

1192
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,760
But it will essentially be like the demo for the game.

1193
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,000
I see.

1194
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,480
Showing off a demo at E3 of a demo.

1195
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,960
A demo of a demo, good times.

1196
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Loki.

1197
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,420
There was an editorial written on Kotaku this week, talking about the, kind of the trend

1198
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:54,160
going on with these new sports games from THQ and EA.

1199
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,400
You may remember the one time use online codes that are part of the Project 10 dollars, or

1200
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:08,080
I guess in THQ's case, we won another five dollars from you.

1201
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,920
I just thought there were some points that were kind of interesting that they brought

1202
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,580
up in this.

1203
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:18,480
Some of it, you know, kind of tying into, will it really be that big a deal for consumers

1204
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,400
out there that are interested in buying used products, because it's going to be additional

1205
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,400
money.

1206
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,140
Well, they were saying that GameStop has been starting to drop in the trade-in values of

1207
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,320
different games.

1208
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:35,080
For most new releases, which you used to be able to get for $30, you're now getting $25.

1209
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:43,840
And it's also, some of the games, like for example, UFC, the use price is now $44.99,

1210
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,800
which is five dollars cheaper than the other new releases.

1211
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:50,020
So they're kind of factoring in, okay, you're going to have to pay another five dollars

1212
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,960
to get online, and it's going to bring it up to the price of a normal use game, or a

1213
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:00,520
normal use game of that quality, that time frame, that kind of stuff.

1214
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,380
So maybe it won't be that big of an impact.

1215
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,240
I still say don't forget what's going on, though, because as soon as you say, well,

1216
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,840
that's not so bad, you know, that's when they start going, okay, well now you're going to

1217
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,240
be having to pay for this, and you're going to have to pay for this, and pay for this,

1218
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,640
and this, and this, and this, and just going to go on and on.

1219
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:31,220
But also they're saying that the one-time use code has diminished resale expectations.

1220
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,040
They're saying that people who tend to be passionate about, you know, games on their

1221
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:43,360
consoles haven't been, like, selling them back in, that kind of stuff, I don't know.

1222
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,760
So it's interesting, though, and I guess this is going to keep going on, and you remember

1223
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,960
there was a rumor, and I'm sure we're not going to hear anything about it until the

1224
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:57,000
game comes out, but it is a few weeks from now that Microsoft will be following suit

1225
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
with Crackdown 2.

1226
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,040
I'm kind of irritated because, yeah, yet another reason that, I don't know if it was so obvious

1227
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,200
at first, but it just diminishes the value of the game to be able to resell.

1228
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,560
Even if you do get the $10 code for free when it's new, you know, if you use it, it's totally

1229
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,240
diminishing the value of the game that you sell back.

1230
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,600
And that, I think, is probably one of the most irritating components of this.

1231
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:26,440
But at the end of the day, the only way that you can express your distaste for this whole

1232
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,320
little rule is to not buy the game.

1233
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,320
But I don't think that's going to happen.

1234
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,480
I think people will still buy it.

1235
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,480
I honestly think we shouldn't be paying for games at $60.

1236
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:40,240
I would like to just boycott the $60 video game, but sadly I don't see it happening.

1237
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,240
And honestly, you know, me personally, this is not really affecting me that much because

1238
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,520
I don't buy used games anymore.

1239
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,000
And a lot of stuff, if I'm going to buy it in the first place, I'm buying it new.

1240
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,440
If I'm, you know, not buying it right when it comes out new, then I'm not going to buy

1241
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
it at all.

1242
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,600
So for me, since this is really just affecting, you know, used games and stuff like that,

1243
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,840
it's not a big deal.

1244
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,200
Now if I wanted to loan it to a friend or something like that, that kind of sucks for

1245
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
them.

1246
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,880
But I don't really run into that situation that much.

1247
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:18,360
Dark Sakura's got guys in their skivvies over there.

1248
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,360
What is going on over there?

1249
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,360
He plays Sims 3.

1250
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,360
I was just picking his pajamas.

1251
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,360
I was just, you're, that's not pajamas.

1252
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,120
That's just sleeping in their underwear.

1253
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,120
No, I know.

1254
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,680
But you know, I'm just saying, it's just funny because I looked over, I'm like, what is she

1255
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,680
playing?

1256
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:35,840
I don't like the pajamas in the game, so I just had him sleep in his undies, but there

1257
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,520
is his undies are Calvin Klein.

1258
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,240
You should get him Calvin Klein undies.

1259
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,280
You should get him bananas in pajamas.

1260
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,120
Do you want me to take a picture and put it, I'm putting a picture up.

1261
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,600
If you really want, I don't care.

1262
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,600
Sorry Loki.

1263
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,140
I looked over there, I'm like, is Dark Sakura watching porn during this program?

1264
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,440
What is she doing?

1265
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,440
What is she doing?

1266
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,440
All right.

1267
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,440
Yeah.

1268
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,720
It's, it's just interesting because, um, I don't know.

1269
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:08,600
It's just seems to me it, their excuses for why they're doing it, um, you know, being

1270
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:13,840
that they're going to enhance the online, enhance like all this community stuff.

1271
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,080
I just have a feeling they're not going to deliver with that in that it's just desperate

1272
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,080
cash grab.

1273
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,360
If, if they really do that, that's cool.

1274
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,440
I'm fine with the extra $10 or whatever they're saying, but otherwise it's just taking a key

1275
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,200
component of the game and charging you for it when it should already be there as part

1276
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,720
of the normal cost.

1277
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,280
My problem is why they're getting money anyways for you sale.

1278
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,360
They really shouldn't deserve that kind of money.

1279
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,520
No, they don't.

1280
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:41,520
The only other thing that kind of pisses me off about the whole thing is, is just, you

1281
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,880
know, not just the resale value, but just the fact that they're, you have all this corporate

1282
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,480
speak about, well, we're taking the money to make our online, uh, some infrastructure

1283
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,600
better to really enhance the experience of playing the games.

1284
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,720
It's like, bitch, you just, you're looking for a way to make money.

1285
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:02,560
I have a comment about that.

1286
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,520
With a UFC, didn't they implement that so badly that some people that even bought it

1287
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,920
brand new got double charged because like the directions weren't clear when you'd enter

1288
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,400
the code and it would actually make you pay for the code and then you could use your code.

1289
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,760
I think I read stuff about that when it came out.

1290
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:24,040
I don't know that I'm not surprised if that's what actually happened.

1291
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:31,720
All right, well, moving on, boy, I've just seen this from chat.

1292
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,720
Somebody just posted this.

1293
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,720
You need a breaking news noise.

1294
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,240
Do I need the breaking news noise because that's ugly.

1295
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,120
I don't have the breaking news noise.

1296
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:55,400
I can talk about, um, how I am breeding stuff in Pokemon and I bike back and forth on the

1297
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,400
path.

1298
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:13,560
Um, so it hatches the eggs quicker because I don't like to run around and apparently

1299
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,560
a new pop music game has just been announced.

1300
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,080
And most of our listeners aren't going to understand what the hell that means.

1301
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,920
But a pop music was a music game franchise that basically imagine trouble with the pop

1302
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,640
ematic bubble and you have nine of those pop ematic bubbles all in a little configuration

1303
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,480
you play popular in Japan and you hit the buttons to, and it was in the movie lost in

1304
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,480
translation.

1305
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,640
I believe, uh, you can play this, whatever, uh, you can play this game.

1306
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,760
I guess a new version of pop music has been announced, but here's the thing.

1307
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:45,840
It is like a U S version now because they're testing this in Irvine, California.

1308
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,880
Please say it doesn't have those ticket redemption machine.

1309
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,880
I hate you.

1310
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,880
Konami.

1311
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:58,160
I hate you so much, the logo looks like it's from beaten, groovy kind of does Konami.

1312
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,400
You just don't get it anymore.

1313
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,640
You're fired.

1314
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,640
I'm firing you.

1315
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,640
Konami.

1316
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,640
You can not make any more music games.

1317
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,920
I wonder if they'll be announcing this week three, I don't know.

1318
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,180
Konami a company that thinks saw is a viable franchise for video games.

1319
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,000
That saw game was not awful.

1320
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,080
I will defend that game cause it was fun except for the combat.

1321
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,360
The combat was dumb, but the puzzles were fun.

1322
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,360
I liked them.

1323
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:24,400
I just like to kill people horrifically with really good puzzles.

1324
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,600
It's like evil professor Layton.

1325
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,880
That should be a game right there.

1326
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:33,560
Kill them with puzzles for the three D S Ray Iannami in our chat says sky and he keeps

1327
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:37,280
saying Konami needs to redesign their rhythm games.

1328
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,240
That's not what I meant.

1329
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,000
It's not what I fucking meant.

1330
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Ticket game.

1331
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,920
I'm not surprised one bit.

1332
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,840
It'll be popular.

1333
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,960
If the deal or no deal game is popular, no, this won't be because it's not something you

1334
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:56,040
see on TV with Howie Mandel true Bobby's world, the ticket redemption game.

1335
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,840
That would be something that would be popular with America's got talent.

1336
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,840
Yeah.

1337
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:09,140
That show speaking of, uh, the saw type things and so forth, there was a lot of news that

1338
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:14,760
came out this week about mortal combat and one of them was this very strange teaser that

1339
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,080
was a mystery and nobody knew what it was.

1340
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,840
I'm trying to play a little bit here in studio.

1341
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,840
It's loud.

1342
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,840
Sorry.

1343
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,840
No, this, no, no.

1344
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,600
This thing, that one, this thing that came out this week, this show, yes, that's supposed

1345
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,600
to be like reptile.

1346
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,600
Right?

1347
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,720
Yeah, no, that, that, that's, that's actually old.

1348
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,840
The guy was friends with Jerry Ryan, which is why she's in it.

1349
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,840
Interesting.

1350
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,960
This, this actually, this actually is a few months old.

1351
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,640
Well, it just, I guess leaked to, to all the blogs and all this stuff, by the way, like

1352
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:50,040
that, he rips the head off the body then eats the head and so pretty, so it's pretty gross,

1353
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,880
but whatever this is, it is basically somebody's re-imagining and people are like, is this

1354
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,880
a trailer for a new game?

1355
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,800
Is this, what the frack is this?

1356
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,080
And Jerry Ryan's in it.

1357
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,080
Jerry Ryan is in it.

1358
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,080
She's Sonya at the very end.

1359
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:06,520
Let me see if I can fast forward and, uh, Johnny cage is the emotion actor for a Nathan

1360
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,080
Drake from uncharted one.

1361
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,080
Is it really cool?

1362
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,080
Well, there's Jerry Ryan.

1363
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:15,520
There's a big climactic scene where they're about to reveal scorpion or whatever.

1364
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:21,640
Uh, so apparently what this ended up being, it is actually a kind of like a labor of love

1365
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:26,360
type of thing where the director was trying to sell Warner brothers on the mortal combat

1366
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,360
pitch.

1367
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
This guy wants to direct the movie.

1368
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,760
This is the guy that directed fame.

1369
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,760
I believe so.

1370
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,760
Yeah.

1371
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,760
That's what it's.

1372
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,760
All right, whatever.

1373
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,760
So apparently, yeah, musical numbers too.

1374
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,760
That'd be awesome.

1375
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,760
Actually.

1376
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,080
Uh, so this is, I love these re-imagining pitches.

1377
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,160
They're like, I saw the one for nightmare on Elm street before they had decided to redo

1378
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,160
it.

1379
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,480
Some guy just funded.

1380
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:51,720
It's kind of a really ballsy thing for them to do is to put it up on the internet for

1381
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,320
all the public scrutiny.

1382
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,640
The guy must've believed in the thing that much.

1383
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,040
And so far the reception has been pretty positive.

1384
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,040
I don't know.

1385
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,040
I gotta be honest.

1386
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,200
I'm going to go against the grain a little bit.

1387
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,660
I think it's well done and it's nice, but I always kind of liked mortal combat cause

1388
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,320
it was a little bit over the top and cartoony.

1389
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,360
And that was a little bit like gritty, real saw for me.

1390
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
I don't know.

1391
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,940
I don't know how I feel about that.

1392
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,680
I don't know if that's how the movie would actually turn out, but I was kind of like,

1393
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,080
I kind of like mortal combat cause it was always a little bit ridiculous.

1394
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,200
The first one did it best.

1395
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,320
The second one was a waste of time.

1396
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,840
But I'm all for, I guess them trying to give this guy a chance, especially since so many

1397
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,040
people seem to be into it.

1398
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:35,000
I mean, just because I have one opinion, you know, whatever, I guess it might get outvoted.

1399
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,760
So I guess it could be cool, but it was really seven minutes of this cop interrogation and

1400
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,560
I would just hope the movie is a little, no, it wasn't just the interrogation.

1401
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,760
It was the fight with Johnny Cage, like introducing the characters.

1402
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,320
I thought it was awesome and they should totally make the movie.

1403
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,320
We'll see.

1404
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,320
We'll see.

1405
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,320
This is my least favorite character in the series.

1406
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,940
Poor Johnny Cage can't catch a break.

1407
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,120
I did like doing the foot through the heart and then the signing the autograph.

1408
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,120
That was kind of cool.

1409
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,120
All right.

1410
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,720
Well, also, you know, because a lot of people did mistake that this might've been a teaser

1411
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:15,000
for the game, apparently there really was a teaser for the game in the works and it

1412
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,160
showed up a little later, just literally a few days later, a new teaser for Mortal Combat

1413
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,160
Nine showed up.

1414
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,840
It's got a little bit of Raiden and he's, you know, shooting lightning and then there's

1415
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:31,120
a lot of like very fast images that kind of shows a lot of the old school characters and

1416
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,480
old school stages from like Mortal Combat Two and Three.

1417
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,080
Like you see Johnny Cage and Reptile and Nightwolf right there shooting his arrow and they're

1418
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,960
on a stage that looks like the pit from the second game.

1419
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:51,240
It almost looks like kind of the best parts of Mortal Combat Two and Three with the graphics

1420
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,960
of the newer Mortal Combat games.

1421
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:01,240
And then kind of like in this super Street Fighter Four-esque 2D, 3D thing.

1422
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,240
I'm sold.

1423
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,240
I think it looks great.

1424
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,240
I'd play it.

1425
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,240
It's cool.

1426
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,600
Um, I'd like to see more characters added.

1427
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:14,800
I know this is just a teaser, but, um, it didn't pick some of the best that's for sure.

1428
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,800
Yeah.

1429
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,800
That hat on the ground is really funny.

1430
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,860
For those that haven't seen the trailer, Kung Lao puts the hat on the ground and it starts

1431
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,880
spinning like a circular saw and he starts grabbing sub-zero and, and pulling him towards

1432
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,880
it.

1433
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,120
Like he's going to rip his body in half with the saw, starting with his ween, wiener.

1434
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,920
So yeah, interesting.

1435
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,360
A little, a little bit over the top, but I don't know.

1436
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,520
Again, a little, a little, they're starting to get a little too realistic.

1437
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,520
I don't know.

1438
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,800
I liked Mortal Combat when it was cartoony and dumb.

1439
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,360
I can't believe we're at nine.

1440
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:49,520
Like you said, that's an insane amount for a lot of forgettable titles.

1441
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,840
Yeah, sadly, I always, I always kind of had an appreciation for Mortal Combat.

1442
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,600
I always thought a lot of them were really underrated and they're a lot of fun.

1443
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,600
They're just dumb fun.

1444
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,920
And that's the important part of the game.

1445
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,720
So there you go.

1446
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,240
Uh, that is supposedly also at the E3 show floor.

1447
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,520
There are some big banners hanging from the ceiling, teasing the new Mortal Combat game.

1448
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,880
So I know I, I definitely want to stop by and check that out.

1449
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,360
I wonder if we can get one.

1450
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,360
Like you could prop me up and I'll know the banner and prop me up and I'll take it down

1451
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,360
and we'll steal it.

1452
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:23,320
You know, the show floor is like, or the ceiling is, you know, not more, it's a lot higher

1453
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,320
than popping you up.

1454
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,320
Yeah.

1455
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,320
I was going to say, you're kind of short.

1456
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,320
Yeah.

1457
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,320
Yeah.

1458
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,320
It's like, hi, you propped me up.

1459
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,320
Great.

1460
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,320
Now I'm only 30 feet away from it.

1461
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,800
Well then you can just kind of like push me up a little more.

1462
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,800
Like, like toss me.

1463
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:36,800
I'll just throw you.

1464
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,800
Like Cirque du Soleil.

1465
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,800
Cirque du Soleil.

1466
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,800
I can't even say it.

1467
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,800
There you go.

1468
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,800
The stupid French thing.

1469
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,800
You were about to say Cirque du Soleil.

1470
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,800
I definitely was not going to say that.

1471
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:48,440
Alright, let's move on to some release dates.

1472
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,840
Travel around the world and talk about what is coming out soon to a retail store near

1473
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,840
you.

1474
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,440
We go to the UK and the U.S. and Japan.

1475
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,800
We're going to start off with Loki in the U.S.

1476
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,640
Yes, you know, it's going to be a wonderful week since the biggest title coming out this

1477
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,120
week is Toy Story 3.

1478
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:12,720
Toy Story 3 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP and PC.

1479
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,840
And now the rest of the crap.

1480
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,640
Let's play Garden coming out on DS this week.

1481
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,800
And on the Wii, let's play Ballerina coming out on DS and the Wii.

1482
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,800
Let's play Ballerina.

1483
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,640
100 classic books.

1484
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,760
The only game released on the DS that actually wasn't rated by the ESRB.

1485
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,680
The most boring video game ever made.

1486
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,680
I want that though.

1487
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,680
Because it's books.

1488
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:37,000
I think that'd be a great, great $20 spent.

1489
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,840
Video game called Let's Go to the Library.

1490
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,920
Legend of Kay coming to the Nintendo DS.

1491
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,960
XG Blast is supposed to be like a shmup game coming to the Nintendo DS.

1492
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,960
Superbike World Championship, SBK coming to the PS3.

1493
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,080
It's a budget game.

1494
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,080
What else?

1495
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,240
Kid Adventure Sky Captain.

1496
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,240
Actually this one looks okay.

1497
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,320
It's kind of like Pilotwings on the Wii.

1498
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,120
Also only a budget game.

1499
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,400
And then this is the kind of stuff that Konami keeps putting out.

1500
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,400
Thank you, Konami.

1501
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,400
You're wonderful.

1502
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,400
Yard Sale.

1503
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,400
There's Sunnyville.

1504
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,800
Guess where you're going to find this game?

1505
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,800
In a yard sale.

1506
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Wait, Sunnyvale?

1507
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
Sunnyville.

1508
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,800
Oh, I was going to say.

1509
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,240
It's like a game set in Sunnyvale?

1510
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,240
That's kind of cool.

1511
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,720
No, it's Sunnyville.

1512
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,720
And thank you, GameStop.

1513
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,200
You put Sunnyville with three L's instead of two.

1514
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,720
Way to proofread.

1515
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,680
Think Smart coming to the Nintendo DS.

1516
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,040
Western Riding Academy on the DS.

1517
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,640
Yay, another horse riding game.

1518
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,760
We don't have any of those.

1519
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:45,120
Naval Assault the Killing Tide, a submarine action game on the Xbox 360.

1520
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:51,200
And another crappy game on the Wii Family Game Show, which is going to be some stupid

1521
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,280
party game by a company I've never heard of, Storm City Games.

1522
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,000
And last but not least, I Spy Universe.

1523
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Who gives a shit?

1524
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,720
I don't care what system it's on.

1525
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,400
The end.

1526
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,360
Ray Iannami in chat says, there aren't enough games set in the SF Bay Area.

1527
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:08,860
How about every racing game ever made?

1528
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:13,560
Always has like some type of San Francisco stage because of the hills.

1529
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:19,920
Although in real life, folks, you go about three miles an hour down all of those roads.

1530
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,920
There's always three.

1531
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,640
It's going to have a San Francisco level because you know, San Francisco, what it's most known

1532
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,680
for earthquakes, because every game that has a disaster in it, San Francisco has the earthquakes.

1533
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:34,640
Cruisin' USA had Blur has a San Francisco level.

1534
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,640
They all do.

1535
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,640
Every single one of them.

1536
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,800
Mario Kart has a San Francisco level.

1537
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,800
That's right.

1538
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,440
It's called Toad San Francisco Adventure.

1539
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,620
Speaking of Blur, by the way, in Mario Kart, did you see that commercial?

1540
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,800
It is amazing.

1541
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,360
That is the best thing I've seen.

1542
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:52,600
Dan was watching Classic Game Room and it was the leading in commercial and I laughed

1543
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,960
my butt off.

1544
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:54,960
Good times.

1545
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,600
What are you fitting your little guy in panties over there?

1546
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,240
He looks like he's wearing panties, mantis.

1547
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,480
I'm picking his bathing suit and I'm just trying out different fabric patterns.

1548
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,920
Trees don't really wear that to the beach, at least in America.

1549
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:11,720
I realize like Greece, it's a little different, but we're all fat.

1550
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,240
I'm just trying different fabrics.

1551
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:17,920
I just want to make sure, you know, Nintendo should want to make sure you were aware.

1552
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,360
I'll use gold sequins.

1553
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,360
Gold sequins.

1554
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,400
Nintendo should really come out with a commercial later on for its next Mario Kart game and

1555
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:29,400
say, yeah, Blur wants to go ahead and make fun of our games, but our games still made

1556
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,600
millions of copies.

1557
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,120
Yours doesn't.

1558
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,120
Fuck you.

1559
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,120
Nintendo.

1560
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,160
Let's go to Japanese release dates.

1561
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:41,520
Clash of the Titans gets its Japanese localization from Namco this week on the Xbox 360.

1562
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,600
Otherwise all is quiet on the 360 this week.

1563
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,880
PlayStation 3 has a little more, not just a version of Clash of the Titans there too,

1564
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:52,920
but they also have Grid getting a price reduction and a game called Hakioki Jun Soroku comes

1565
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,160
out in a special and limited edition.

1566
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,960
So usually when it's limited edition, you know, it's a kind of a bigger kind of a game.

1567
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,120
It comes with a plate and a pillowcase and a clock.

1568
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,080
It is a whole big franchise out there.

1569
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,200
There's actually an anime based on it as well.

1570
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,360
So that's the Hakioki is coming out there on PS3.

1571
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,800
So that's a pretty big release over there this week.

1572
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:19,640
Also on the other systems going to the Nintendo Wii, Hospital 6 Nin no Ishii is coming out

1573
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,640
in Japan from Atlas.

1574
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,280
I don't know if this is a trauma center game.

1575
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,280
No, it's not.

1576
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,560
I guess it's maybe a spinoff or something.

1577
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,440
It's just a different hospital game, but there is your mandatory chick with big boobs.

1578
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,560
No, that's the trauma center.

1579
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,560
Is it really?

1580
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
Yeah, the one that we just got.

1581
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,560
It looks like an anime or something.

1582
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,560
It looks exactly the same.

1583
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,560
Really?

1584
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:37,360
It just looks so different.

1585
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,360
Trauma Team.

1586
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,840
That's what the American one's called.

1587
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,840
Weird.

1588
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,840
All right.

1589
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:47,560
Well, maybe it's the release of Trauma Team then.

1590
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,640
I define better Dark Sakura when you're showing me that guy.

1591
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,360
How about how about Fishnet?

1592
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,880
No, thank you.

1593
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:54,880
All right.

1594
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:01,000
Also on the Nintendo DS this week, Igo Koro Koyushitsu comes out on the Nintendo DS this

1595
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
week.

1596
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,400
And this is a game where apparently you, I don't, I don't even know what this is.

1597
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,240
It's like apples on the cover with the stylus.

1598
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,240
It's like, let's draw apples.

1599
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,240
I wonder if it's a painting game.

1600
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
I bet that's what it is.

1601
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,240
It's a painting game.

1602
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Yeah.

1603
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:15,560
It's probably a let's paint on the DS.

1604
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:17,520
Learn how to paint apples.

1605
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,560
Still life.

1606
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,240
So they did have a let's paint game on the Wii.

1607
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,640
It's a painting game fun.

1608
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:30,680
And then lastly on the PSP, nothing this week, but next week you get project diva on this

1609
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,560
Sega from Sega on PSP, you have that to look forward to dark soccer.

1610
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:45,080
How about the UK stuff on the 13th of my Theon for PC and the 16th, we have ancients of UGA.

1611
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,520
Okay.

1612
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,800
And then, um, on the 18th, we have everybody's tennis.

1613
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,160
I'm not alone.

1614
01:15:54,160 --> 01:16:00,440
International cricket, 2010 project runway and metal gear, solid peace Walker on PSP.

1615
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,080
Yeah.

1616
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,080
That's pretty good.

1617
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,080
Let's move to Europe right now.

1618
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:13,640
You can't forget about the Korean releases, which last week brought, uh, the new DJ max

1619
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,640
game.

1620
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,640
That's like ours that we got here.

1621
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,760
Should we throw in Korean releases?

1622
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,760
No.

1623
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:24,720
Oh, cause we don't want to.

1624
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,720
And a Miro.

1625
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,720
Yes.

1626
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,720
All right.

1627
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,200
Uh, let's talk a little bit about 3d on PS3.

1628
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,200
That's right.

1629
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:40,040
This week we actually got update on the PS3 firmware, uh, to allow for some games to support

1630
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,800
stereoscopic 3d.

1631
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:49,440
Um, these games of course would be wipeout HD pain, super stardust HD and motor storm

1632
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,440
Pacific grip.

1633
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,520
Um, they have a demo apparently with I think one level that was in 3d and a wipeout I want

1634
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,720
to say is all in 3d pain has a 3d level.

1635
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:04,000
You know, that was actually one of the reasons, um, that the, uh, back in the day when, remember

1636
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,080
when they were doing the gorillas holographic thing for their concerts, um, they were doing

1637
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:16,600
the projections and everything and they said that, uh, they had to keep sound around it

1638
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:22,880
at a particular level or it would start making the light waves start jitter and they had

1639
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:28,120
that problem when they did with Madonna because when her song started in it was that heavy

1640
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,760
bass and it made the holograms jitter.

1641
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,640
Well, being that this isn't holograms, hopefully we won't have that problem.

1642
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:42,960
But it's still a matter of, of sight and perception and it's still the waves themselves are still

1643
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,160
a physical thing.

1644
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,440
The only holograms I want to see are fronted by Jim.

1645
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:52,640
Now this, I mean, looks kind of cool, but you know, it's one of those things.

1646
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,880
I'm not buying a new damn TV and I'm not buying, you know, expensive glasses to go with these

1647
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,800
TVs just for some of these games.

1648
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,400
It's one of those things where when the technology comes down in price in about five years, I

1649
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,400
think more people will have it.

1650
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:11,280
But right now I think this is a little too soon, but I am so like over the 3d craze.

1651
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,400
Like I just, I see all these movies coming out in 3d like there's the resident evil movie

1652
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,720
in 3d and the new saws, everything is in 3d and I'm just, I'm over it.

1653
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,520
3d movies make you sick.

1654
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,520
Stop it.

1655
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,880
I liked Avatar in 3d.

1656
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,880
That was a long time.

1657
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:32,480
But Avatar would have been, I would have felt just as fine with Avatar in 2d.

1658
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,800
Having seen it both ways, I really did prefer it in 3d.

1659
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,360
Well here's the thing with like Avatar or something like that, um, when they're filming

1660
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,520
that movie, they're not really, it's just like a normal movie just filmed in 3d.

1661
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,120
Whereas a lot of people, when you film something in 3d, they want to do a lot of stuff to really

1662
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:52,800
kind of capitalize on the 3d, like throw stuff at you or you know, have you fly around really

1663
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,720
fast or something like that.

1664
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,280
And that's great and all, but it's, this isn't like an amusement park ride.

1665
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,840
I mean, we don't really need that kind of stuff.

1666
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,780
Just make a good movie and that'd be it.

1667
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:11,520
Now the motion box seats, that's more amusement park fare.

1668
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,520
And God, please do not have that trend make its way to consoles.

1669
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,320
I don't need a moving couch.

1670
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,320
All right.

1671
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,000
Well, another music game was announced this week.

1672
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,120
That's going to be showing its way at the floor at E3 this year.

1673
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,100
It's DJ Hero 2.

1674
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,120
You know, some folks are saying the DJ Hero didn't really sell what they were hoping it

1675
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,120
would.

1676
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,100
Although didn't, didn't DJ Hero kind of keep selling?

1677
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,400
Like maybe it didn't sell a lot at the beginning, but it kind of has kept selling.

1678
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,400
It's done okay.

1679
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:42,320
I think for like a brand new franchise, you know, it did all right.

1680
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,400
And considering how much they've supported their download content, in other words, not

1681
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,400
at all.

1682
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,400
Um, I'm surprised it sold what it did.

1683
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:53,960
Well, there was some, uh, content released this week in celebration of DJ Hero 2.

1684
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,240
They did release some free content this week.

1685
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:05,840
Uh, it is DJ Hero 2's mix for Just Dance by Lady Gaga with Ghosts and Stuff by Deadmau5.

1686
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:14,400
Let's listen a little bit of it here.

1687
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:22,480
Yeah, it's all right.

1688
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,480
Sounds kind of fun.

1689
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:27,200
Uh, so 70 new songs are supposed to be coming to DJ Hero 2.

1690
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,640
Kanye West, Chemical Brothers, Dr. Dre, Gaga, Rihanna, Metallica, lots and lots and lots

1691
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,920
of artists going to be in this.

1692
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,640
Uh, the sequel will also be putting in microphone game, gameplay.

1693
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,400
It's also going to have a lot more of, uh, two turntables at once.

1694
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:45,600
So literally you will have, yes, two turntables and a microphone.

1695
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,080
Oh, how many times have you heard that joke this week?

1696
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Then they got it.

1697
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,640
They totally have to put back in there then.

1698
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,600
Um, yeah, it's interesting that they have the karaoke mode in there.

1699
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,560
I guess it's kind of cool to have an additional person playing.

1700
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,880
Um, I wonder if they didn't mention anything about a guitar here, you know, guitar mode

1701
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:01,880
coming back.

1702
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,440
So I'm wondering if they're going to do something special with that, if they're gonna have like

1703
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,440
band mode or something.

1704
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,440
I hope they just scrapped it.

1705
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,280
I didn't like it in the first one.

1706
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,240
There was only, there were only 10 songs.

1707
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:14,400
Yeah, but it's, hey, it's better to have something, you know, additional than, you know, removing

1708
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,400
something altogether.

1709
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,680
Now, granted, if it's a space issue and they want to replace those 10 songs with better

1710
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,680
songs.

1711
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,680
Yeah.

1712
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,680
Yeah, that's fine.

1713
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:27,000
Um, did you see though the freestyle, um, crossfade stuff that they have now?

1714
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
No.

1715
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
That's pretty sweet.

1716
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,320
Whereas before you could do like, you know, those freestyle sections where you had the

1717
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,320
red button.

1718
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:35,320
Yeah, I hate it.

1719
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,240
Well now they have freestyle scratching so you can do like sections where you can do

1720
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:42,200
scratching and freestyle cross fades and they'll actually give you cues where different like

1721
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,640
vocal things start and you can crossfade back and forth.

1722
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,640
That's really cool.

1723
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:46,640
Yeah.

1724
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,800
So a lot more stuff.

1725
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,240
And they also said, um, you know, those samples that you trigger and stuff, how they really

1726
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,640
have the annoying, um, uh, flava flave samples and stuff like that.

1727
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,800
Well now the samples are going to be, um, you know, tying in with the songs instead.

1728
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,640
You're not going to choose these different sample sets.

1729
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:06,480
So Tiger class says, I mispronounced the name of that other artist is dead mouse.

1730
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,480
Well, it's not my fault.

1731
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,480
He has to type all week.

1732
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,480
And he has an awesome, whatever.

1733
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,480
He has an awesome mouse.

1734
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,480
Apparently he's in the game.

1735
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,200
I think he has a giant mouse head.

1736
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:18,800
We need some more like real dancey artists or real club artists like pendulum.

1737
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:23,840
They're supposed to be focusing it more on, um, you know, electronic artists this time.

1738
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:24,840
I hope so.

1739
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,400
Pendulum would be awesome.

1740
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,400
That would be, that would, I'd buy the game day one more than I already will buy it day

1741
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,400
one.

1742
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
Oh, I'm buying it day one as it is.

1743
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,400
Oh yeah.

1744
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,360
Even though I don't play the first one, I'd still want to go back to it.

1745
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,480
It's just, you know, I, you know, I'm buying that day one scene with rock band three with

1746
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,320
the keyboard because I totally want to play that.

1747
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,800
I wonder if they'll improve the turntable at all because there were so many people that

1748
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:53,820
were having problems with like buttons stop working and I have problems with the scratching

1749
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,120
doesn't always trigger.

1750
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,120
Yeah.

1751
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,640
It's a little tricky sometimes.

1752
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,400
Um, I don't know.

1753
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:06,160
I have a, what was it, a, uh, beta controller and I also have a regular controller.

1754
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,560
I have a wired controller.

1755
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,560
Nice.

1756
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,880
Oh, I have the wired three 61 from the demo.

1757
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,880
Yeah.

1758
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:13,880
Yeah.

1759
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,880
Yeah.

1760
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:15,880
Demo controller.

1761
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:16,880
Yeah.

1762
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,880
All right folks.

1763
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,440
Well, believe it or not, before we get to the end of part a, I have to break guys cause

1764
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:32,400
we do have some special news.

1765
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,400
That's right.

1766
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,640
We break for this a special news report here.

1767
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,640
Apparently this comes to us.

1768
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:42,240
Thanks to Twitter and uh, uh, Bobby sent this along and alerted me to what's going on here.

1769
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,680
Apparently the event is starting to get underway.

1770
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:51,360
The whole, uh, kinetic event, they have forced the entire audience to wear ponchos.

1771
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,820
They're all in these metallic poncho looking things.

1772
01:23:55,820 --> 01:24:01,600
Apparently the Xbox event will involve a splash zone or something.

1773
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,480
I don't know what the hell is going on.

1774
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,720
It's going to be there hitting watermelons and tall.

1775
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,760
This is the one, this is, they're repeating this Monday night and you, you, here's the

1776
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,760
thing.

1777
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,600
My mom and I actually had the opportunity to go to this event, but a day late cause

1778
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,480
they're redoing it tomorrow night and we were like, that's okay.

1779
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,600
And now I'm really feeling that was a good idea.

1780
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,160
I would, that looks fun cause I don't know.

1781
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:27,200
I'd like to get watermelon on me or something.

1782
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:30,520
You get to keep these little shoulder pad poncho things.

1783
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,280
Everybody looks so happy in the pictures to be wearing them.

1784
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:39,980
They're probably like, Oh my God, I'm going to be a TV with this.

1785
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:42,320
I'm not even joking, Bobby posts a link in chat.

1786
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,320
I know you're listening.

1787
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:44,320
It's funny.

1788
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,320
Good stuff.

1789
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,320
Big silver.

1790
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,400
But if everybody in the audience is wearing that, it's going to look weird on TV.

1791
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:52,560
You know what I was thinking though?

1792
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,480
I was, I was making the joke, I'm like, you know how these camera games just really suck

1793
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,880
and they don't work very well.

1794
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,560
I'm like, is that what I need to wear?

1795
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,480
Yeah, it's going to come packaged in.

1796
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,760
Well you know how they had like, was it the stupid jumpsuits and stuff?

1797
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:11,200
So apparently the connect only works if you're really wearing like a silly costume.

1798
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:14,800
It's all silly costumes only.

1799
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,400
All right, we are getting to the end here of part a on our show, but you know, we cannot

1800
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,920
call it quits until we get to one more segment.

1801
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,160
We have to do the segment every week because if we don't, dark soccer finds me down and

1802
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,240
threatens to kill me.

1803
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,240
And sometimes she does.

1804
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:34,120
Uh, it's the classic game of the week.

1805
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:37,200
Dark soccer is going to dive into the vault and find a game she thinks you kids ought

1806
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,560
to be playing this week and respecting dark soccer.

1807
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,080
What is the classic game of the week?

1808
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,040
Today's classic game is magician Lord.

1809
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:50,840
And I literally walked into the vault and looked, what's the first game I see a magician

1810
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:51,840
Lord.

1811
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,840
Okay.

1812
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:54,720
Which is a Neo Geo game.

1813
01:25:54,720 --> 01:26:01,840
It was developed by alpha Denshi and published by SMK and it is a Neo Geo arcade and the

1814
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,520
home systems and virtual console came out in 1990.

1815
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:13,160
So this is a platform game and it's, uh, it actually was one of the pack-ins for the Neo

1816
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,000
Geo AES.

1817
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,440
So that's probably why I have a copy.

1818
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:22,800
Um, but it's about this wizard named Elta who is the last magician Lord going to save

1819
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,960
his homeland.

1820
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:30,960
And um, you go through and you get different spheres that will give you different abilities.

1821
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:38,200
Um, excuse me, they can jump and shoot and climb and do all kinds of stuff.

1822
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,920
I mean, you know, those fire and he cosplays every time he gets a sphere.

1823
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,920
Well, okay.

1824
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,600
He actually gets different abilities with each sphere.

1825
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,440
Um, he also walks really funny and even if he walks fast, he still looks like he's prancing

1826
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:57,160
kinda like it's just like he's climbing a ladder right now, but you just have to look

1827
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,160
at him walk.

1828
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,160
See, well, he's in, nevermind.

1829
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,120
He wants funny when he's in for me.

1830
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:08,280
Anyway, so he got, has a dragon warrior form who breathes fire and it's a continuous short

1831
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:14,840
range attack and you can aim it diagonally and then water man where, um, those water

1832
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:20,000
grenades that are blue bubbles that explode into water pillars, which sounds kind of like

1833
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:27,160
caterpillar, but not, um, and then there's Poseidon, which is a more powerful water man.

1834
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:33,240
He shoots waves of water and has a lot of damage and he can freeze enemies and shatter

1835
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,240
on impact.

1836
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:37,480
It moves very slowly.

1837
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:44,040
The Shinobi, um, has, um, he's more agile and has powerful magic arcs of fire.

1838
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:46,000
They are wide, but still moving.

1839
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,240
There's the Samurai who can attack through barriers, which is walls, shields, multiple

1840
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:57,880
enemies with the boomerang like energy attack and then Raijin who, um, gives Elta the ability

1841
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:04,440
to jump a lot better and has an electrical field around his body and I guess that's because

1842
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,760
Raijin's an electric person.

1843
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,800
Um, so that is the game.

1844
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:13,200
It's just, I think that he just walks really funny, kind of prancy funny.

1845
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,200
He does.

1846
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,200
He prances a little bit.

1847
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,200
It's kind of funny.

1848
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,520
I like his, his, a stylish blue hat.

1849
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,520
It's quite stylish.

1850
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,520
Yeah, very stylish.

1851
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:21,520
I like that game.

1852
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,520
All right.

1853
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:23,520
There it is, folks.

1854
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,520
Your classic game of the week.

1855
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,120
Magician Lord.

1856
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,440
Very classic Neo Geo game.

1857
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,440
It's not a fighting game.

1858
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,440
What's that?

1859
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,440
He was fighting the purple nipple.

1860
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,440
Yes, he is fighting the purple nipple.

1861
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,000
Level one boss.

1862
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Good stuff.

1863
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,280
Wasn't that game on Nick Arcade a lot?

1864
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,280
Magician Lord?

1865
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,280
I think so.

1866
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,280
I think so.

1867
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:41,520
I always get that one in Blue's Journey confused because the Magician Lord guy is really, really

1868
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,520
blue.

1869
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,520
Yes.

1870
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,520
He is very blue.

1871
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,520
Quite blue.

1872
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,520
All right.

1873
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,560
We are going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't worry guys.

1874
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,360
We'll be right back with plenty more.

1875
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,560
We're going to get to your phone calls tonight, of course, some rapid fire news, the mailbag

1876
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,560
and all that good stuff we always do.

1877
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,920
Also tonight, I've been keeping it a secret.

1878
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,580
I want to do a little something special for you guys that are listening tonight.

1879
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:04,960
We're going to do an Orange Lounge Radio game.

1880
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:05,960
That's right tonight.

1881
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,080
And we're bringing back a game tonight.

1882
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,960
I know a lot of you were asking for a list list tonight, but we did list list for last

1883
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:11,960
year's E3.

1884
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:15,400
We, there's a game we haven't played in like months and months.

1885
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:20,640
Alright guys, video game match game is coming up in part B tonight when we come back.

1886
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,920
So this is good because we actually have four people in the studio, so we can actually kind

1887
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,540
of do the video game match game.

1888
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:35,760
So we'll be right back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1889
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,440
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, June the 13th

1890
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,440
of 2010.

1891
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:48,000
We've got a lot of busy, busy E3 pre news tonight and lots of breaking news and updates

1892
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,560
going on and all this stuff happening.

1893
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,180
And will the madness never end?

1894
01:29:52,180 --> 01:30:00,680
Of course not.

1895
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,920
I'm Tom Brokaw with a special report.

1896
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:07,460
No, actually what's going on here, Alan just forwarded me this email and I kind of knew

1897
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:08,460
about this.

1898
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:13,280
I guess this email just went out from Blizzard kind of pimping their new real ID system on

1899
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,000
World of Warcraft.

1900
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,760
And one of the things you're going to want to pay attention to on this is the whole real

1901
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:20,000
names for friends system.

1902
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Actually let me back up.

1903
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,120
Let me talk a little bit about what this real ID thing is.

1904
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:31,460
Basically it's Blizzard's own internal version of Steam slash XFire for their own games.

1905
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,440
So you can see, like if you have friends that play WoW on different servers, you're going

1906
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,760
to be able to talk to them on those different servers and interact with them and so forth.

1907
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:42,900
But here's part of the catch that goes with that is that you're going to have real names

1908
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,240
for friends.

1909
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:49,080
Your real ID friends will appear under their real life names on your friends list when

1910
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:52,560
chatting, communicating in game, or viewing a character's profile.

1911
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:58,320
Real ID friends can also see who's on each other's real ID friends list, making it easy

1912
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,280
for players to connect with other people they know.

1913
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,480
I hate that.

1914
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:03,080
I'm not going to use this.

1915
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,880
I don't want people to know my full name.

1916
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,160
I use a fake name here on the show.

1917
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,640
I realize some people do, but it's kind of one of those like, you know, I don't really

1918
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,640
like to advertise it.

1919
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,200
I don't want to be found that easy.

1920
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,200
You know what I mean?

1921
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,420
I can't imagine that they're going to force you to use your real name, that there won't

1922
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:20,160
be some sort of option to use a fake name.

1923
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,900
Also, maybe they'll go by what your account name, whatever you put for that.

1924
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:29,880
And I have used multiple accounts on WoW and I have used random names.

1925
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,160
So I think I had to use my real name.

1926
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:35,480
I think I might have tried to put my just my last initial and that's what I would like.

1927
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:38,880
I don't care if it's my real last initial, but I don't want, I don't want somebody to

1928
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,400
Google my name and find all my WoW characters, especially with what I named some of them.

1929
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,400
Okay.

1930
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,960
It's not, I don't need my students at work doing that.

1931
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:48,960
Sassy pants?

1932
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,960
Sure.

1933
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:56,640
So anyway, I don't know, I'm just, it's kind of irritated.

1934
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,640
Allen is saying that they're taking it from the billing name of the credit card.

1935
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:00,680
That's ridiculous.

1936
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:05,320
And if it's true that they're trying to connect it with Facebook, that's even worse because

1937
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,440
sorry, I just got sent another picture of everybody in ponchos and I'm laughing.

1938
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:16,720
There needs to be, honestly that, that's a, I even have to say that's a violation of privacy.

1939
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:17,720
It totally is.

1940
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,000
I really hope that can be suppressed.

1941
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,640
I hope Blizzard is not that stupid.

1942
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:26,400
Blizzard, if you're listening, I hope you are not that stupid.

1943
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,440
That'll make you pay $25 to change it.

1944
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,040
Will I get a pony with it?

1945
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,040
Probably.

1946
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,040
We'll see.

1947
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,040
Or a pet.

1948
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,040
Alright.

1949
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,040
More breaking news.

1950
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,040
Will there be more breaking news throughout the show?

1951
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,040
I don't know.

1952
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,040
It should have been a game.

1953
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,040
Like, how many breaking news interruptions will there be tonight?

1954
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,040
It's a crazy night.

1955
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,240
Alright guys, let's get back into some gaming news.

1956
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,280
We're gonna do some quick stories here.

1957
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,280
Loki and myself.

1958
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:49,840
Jamie's sitting out tonight because of her voice.

1959
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,760
Loki, go ahead and let's get to some quick news.

1960
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,160
Uh, Portal 2.

1961
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,160
Just like the party that they were gonna have for Portal 2.

1962
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,160
It's been delayed.

1963
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,880
Well, the party got cancelled.

1964
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,080
Game delayed though.

1965
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:05,560
Not coming out until 2011.

1966
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,160
And that's too bad.

1967
01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,000
Oh well.

1968
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,900
Game though that is coming out over here, also in 2011, which is kind of a surprise

1969
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:18,600
seeing as the last game hasn't sold very well at all.

1970
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:26,120
Um, Yakuza 4 is slated to be heading to North America and Europe in Spring 2011.

1971
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:33,960
Hopefully, they do not cut out a ton of stuff like they did with Yakuza 3.

1972
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:42,320
Final Fantasy 9 is making its way to Playstation Network next week.

1973
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:46,720
And personally, 9 was my least favorite on the Playstation.

1974
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,440
But hey, if you still wanna buy it, it's only gonna be $10.

1975
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:51,440
And that'll be out.

1976
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,600
Uh, did you forget about Final Fantasy 8?

1977
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:55,600
That's a great game.

1978
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,240
A great game to make fun of.

1979
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,240
Whatever.

1980
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,240
That game is 8 better than 9.

1981
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,240
Yeah, 9 is terrible.

1982
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,080
What is wrong with you people?

1983
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:08,120
Avivi was cool, Nquinna was funny, and the game sucked.

1984
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:11,260
I'm doing a show with insane people.

1985
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:13,400
And you've just learned this now after what?

1986
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:14,400
How many episodes?

1987
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,400
370.

1988
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,400
Yeah.

1989
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:19,240
So, yeah, next Tuesday.

1990
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,240
That'll be coming out.

1991
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:26,080
Finally, they're teasing something related to a Potapon beta test.

1992
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:30,040
This apparently is counting down.

1993
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,800
Doesn't say when it's supposed to end.

1994
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,600
I'm guessing sometime next week.

1995
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,960
I hope that's hours and not days.

1996
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,960
I don't know.

1997
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,720
Well, during E3 would kinda be the time to do it, so.

1998
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,560
It's on the Japanese site.

1999
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,840
And it's interesting though, maybe it's gonna have online multiplayer.

2000
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,840
Obviously, if they're doing a beta test, it's probably gonna have online multiplayer because

2001
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:55,400
they have to stress their servers, but I don't know.

2002
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,360
Not really seeing anything on the countdown site.

2003
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:09,720
But yeah, if you want to check it out, it's www.jp.com, s-c-e-j slash marusen, m-a-r-u-s-e-n.

2004
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,760
It's down to 86, so it must be hours.

2005
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:12,920
Yes, it's hours.

2006
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:16,200
So that would probably be sometime this week during E3.

2007
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,200
Surprise.

2008
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,480
Perhaps their press conference time?

2009
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,480
Maybe around?

2010
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:21,480
I don't know.

2011
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,480
About three days?

2012
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,480
Yeah, maybe.

2013
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,480
Let's see.

2014
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,480
All right.

2015
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:26,480
Moving on to some other news.

2016
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:27,480
Puzzle Quest.

2017
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,880
Yes, the news keeps coming on Puzzle Quest.

2018
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,200
Actually, this is great.

2019
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:34,660
Chapters one and two are free on the iPhone right now.

2020
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:37,880
So if you want to grab free Puzzle Quest, you gotta do it right now.

2021
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,160
I don't know how long this is available for, but I believe it's just the weekend.

2022
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,240
So unfortunately, those of you listening to the podcast Monday morning, this sale may

2023
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,600
already be over.

2024
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,600
But yeah, chapters one and two of Puzzle Quest, they split it up on the iPhone.

2025
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:50,600
It's free right now.

2026
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,520
Now, if you actually get all the way to the third chapter, it's gonna cost you $1.99 for

2027
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:56,520
the third chapter.

2028
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,840
But really, is it gonna hold your attention that long?

2029
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,640
I got to the training dummy and then I stopped.

2030
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:06,780
It's a little wonky on the iPhone because I did play that a little bit.

2031
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:12,480
And my problem with it on the iPhone is that my 3G is not built to play a game like that.

2032
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,000
It will be better on that new iPhone 4 or whatever's coming out in a couple weeks.

2033
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,920
I have a 3GS, so I'll see how it does on mine.

2034
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,360
It'll probably do a little better with yours.

2035
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,720
What did you think about the iPhone 4?

2036
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,000
It looks amazing.

2037
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,280
Do you really want to get in that discussion, Loki?

2038
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,520
Yeah, sure.

2039
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,800
I'm gonna get one, absolutely.

2040
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:32,320
Well, my contract, I'm one of those people where my contract is up in October usually.

2041
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,400
So I get the whole retro deal or whatever from AT&T where I can upgrade and it's coming

2042
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,000
out right in time for my birthday.

2043
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,660
But you know, I need a faster phone.

2044
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:43,240
Like a lot of the apps are really hurting on the old phone and you know, just for the

2045
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,240
technology to catch up.

2046
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,160
I love the idea of a front-facing camera.

2047
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,080
I think the video conferencing is going to be fun.

2048
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,560
It'll be a fun little toy to have.

2049
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,200
What did you think about the motion controllers or the new stuff?

2050
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:55,200
With gyroscope?

2051
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,720
We're going to get layer on it.

2052
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,120
I'm curious to see how it's going to be implemented.

2053
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:02,440
But I'm a little worried though because I know I'm going to get these video phone calls

2054
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:03,440
from Miklatov.

2055
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,040
Miklatov's going to call me on video.

2056
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,720
He's going to be like, look, my Pokemon evolved.

2057
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:09,720
Unless it's adorable.

2058
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:11,120
Will I do that?

2059
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:12,120
He'll totally do it.

2060
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,800
I'll only do it when I get black and white.

2061
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,760
And video editing on live.

2062
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,060
The HD camera thing is pretty cool.

2063
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:21,080
I'm actually surprised you of all people asked this, Loki.

2064
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,680
Are you interested in this phone call?

2065
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:28,560
No, I was watching the live blog because there was really nothing going on this week.

2066
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:37,240
So it was kind of like my, I guess, preparation for the live blogs and conferences and stuff

2067
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,040
like that that are coming this week.

2068
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,960
Kind of the prep course.

2069
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,960
I'm sorry.

2070
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:45,680
Bobby, I just stopped listening to this show because Bobby sent me a link here on Twitter.

2071
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,680
Another Twit pic.

2072
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,960
That is itagaki in a space poncho.

2073
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:53,000
I need a live journal icon of this immediately.

2074
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,680
Dark Sakura, can you help?

2075
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,680
It's itagaki in the space poncho.

2076
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,880
Send it to me.

2077
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,680
Space poncho itagaki.

2078
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,400
That's all you need.

2079
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,400
I love it.

2080
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,880
He's kind of looking up like, behold, the future is in my poncho.

2081
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:11,320
Oh, this is great.

2082
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:12,320
I'm sorry.

2083
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,440
I'm having to distract Shane for a moment.

2084
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:18,480
Perhaps we can, uh, I had to show him my favorite car ever.

2085
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,840
This Microsoft is genius.

2086
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,040
They're getting all these celebrities to put on space ponchos.

2087
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,040
Look at this.

2088
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,040
Look at this.

2089
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,040
Felicia day in a space poncho.

2090
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,040
There you go.

2091
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,040
Itagaki.

2092
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,040
I'll make you.

2093
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,040
I just did take your private message.

2094
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,040
I'm going to make one of him.

2095
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,720
This is in the ponchos as space rock star.

2096
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:36,460
Hey, you want to know something, uh, or kind of a funny game we should play?

2097
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:40,240
How much will these space ponchos go for on eBay?

2098
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:44,620
I hope they're covered in watermelon.

2099
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:47,560
You know, that's probably just going to be some sort of light showing or reflect off

2100
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:48,640
the space poncho.

2101
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:51,700
They better like make you turn those in on the way out because they have another show

2102
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:52,700
tomorrow night.

2103
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,420
We could have worn the space ponchos.

2104
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:58,720
You know, if you don't go to work, we still laugh at you.

2105
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,400
I would have been like breaking news.

2106
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:07,820
We could take emo pictures like the first few people that had them see ditch work or

2107
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:12,080
space poncho ditch work or space poncho.

2108
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,080
Now it's a tough call.

2109
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,400
I get it that those would be the same thing.

2110
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,400
So I'm sorry.

2111
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,600
Work or space poncho.

2112
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:23,440
The only way that this could possibly be cooler is if they had a Conan O'Brien there and he

2113
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:29,880
just starts doing in the year 2000 because that would be awesome.

2114
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,040
I wonder if they're branded at all and if they don't make you turn them in, they could

2115
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,040
probably go for a lot.

2116
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,320
It's probably like the glasses after Captain EO.

2117
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:41,080
There'll be a large man standing there making you deposit them in the bin or he will rough

2118
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,080
you up.

2119
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,080
What is that?

2120
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,080
Captain EO at Disneyland.

2121
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,280
Do you remember the honey I shrunk the audience thing?

2122
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,680
That thing was weird.

2123
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:48,680
Okay.

2124
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:52,080
Imagine that with an 80s movie starring Michael Jackson.

2125
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,680
It's the greatest motion picture ever made.

2126
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,720
I can't believe that for a second.

2127
01:39:56,720 --> 01:39:57,840
It's coming back.

2128
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,840
It's there.

2129
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,840
I saw it a couple weeks ago.

2130
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:00,840
It's amazing.

2131
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:05,120
They brought it back after Michael Jackson kicked it.

2132
01:40:05,120 --> 01:40:06,120
Yes.

2133
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:07,120
After he beat it.

2134
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:11,560
After they realized that honey, I struck the kids, wait, we haven't done that in a long

2135
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,560
time.

2136
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,480
I have to say that the honey I shrunk the audience was pretty fun because it had Eric

2137
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,120
Idol in it.

2138
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,640
Bobby Black Wolf in our chat room.

2139
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,640
Bobby is pointing out a, usually you can keep stuff from Ms press conferences.

2140
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:26,840
I still have the ass cushion they gave us in 2007.

2141
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:27,840
It's in my garage.

2142
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,000
What was that used for?

2143
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,760
Well, I noticed it gives you hemorrhoids.

2144
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:39,840
Well, if that's, that's the same, there was the one that was, this 360 is so great.

2145
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,720
My eight is is flaring.

2146
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:50,120
I went to the 360, um, uh, dealie, uh, where they had us, uh, with the headphones and they

2147
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:52,800
didn't let us keep the headphones, but they were expensive.

2148
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,860
Well, these are from the future, these space ponchos.

2149
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:57,440
So they might be expensive too.

2150
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,920
So if I called in sick to work tomorrow, I might get in trouble and get a writeup, but

2151
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,120
I would get a space poncho.

2152
01:41:02,120 --> 01:41:05,520
It could be worth it, but see, here's the thing.

2153
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,520
Okay.

2154
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:09,720
I think I have like a couple of coworkers who listen to this show now and the bad thing

2155
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,640
is I'm actually legitimately getting sick.

2156
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:15,100
So if I do call into work tomorrow, it's not for space poncho.

2157
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:18,340
It's because I'm sick, but now they're going to go around telling people, Oh, if you listen

2158
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:23,080
to Rob show, he called in sick cause he wants to go get a space poncho and then they'll understand

2159
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,000
either way.

2160
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,240
No, actually my coworkers are pretty cool.

2161
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,280
They'd be like, as long as I get as long as you wear it to work.

2162
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:38,080
Most of my coworkers, like most of my coworkers are like, you do a radio show.

2163
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,560
I wonder if I could wear that to work.

2164
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,720
It's like, yeah, I've worn Santa hats before.

2165
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,160
I can't see how that's any different.

2166
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,960
Just come back from LA and show up to work in your space poncho.

2167
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:55,560
What you need to do is you need to go around E3 gathering parts to this grand costume that

2168
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:57,560
you will wear through E3.

2169
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,800
Well, it's going to be mostly lanyards probably.

2170
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:04,080
Lanyards and space poncho.

2171
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,040
Black Wolf and Chat says, I've never heard that they're doing this event again though,

2172
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,040
but we have an invite.

2173
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,040
Yeah.

2174
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,040
We have tickets for tomorrow.

2175
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:14,240
Yeah, but we're just not going, but now I kind of want to go grab the space poncho and

2176
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:15,240
leave.

2177
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,600
Ooh, it's a good idea.

2178
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,600
I don't know what it is.

2179
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,160
It's a repeat for fans or something, right?

2180
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,160
Yeah.

2181
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:24,120
It was a higher Cirque du Soleil and the blackout on TVs till Tuesday, I think there's a reason

2182
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:25,120
for it.

2183
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,120
They're probably doing fans tomorrow or something.

2184
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,120
Yeah.

2185
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:32,900
It was something through, I guess, the campus that they're holding it on and they were giving

2186
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:36,560
away tickets to the public and we scored a couple.

2187
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,560
That's cool.

2188
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:38,560
Space poncho.

2189
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,560
All right.

2190
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:42,920
By the way, we were supposed to be doing news and Black Wolf says, are you sure it's tomorrow?

2191
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,920
Yes.

2192
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:47,360
A hundred times because this is the same question Rob asked me.

2193
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,360
Yeah.

2194
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:49,800
And I put him through the whole interrogation too.

2195
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,000
I'm like, okay, well, are you sure it's not Sunday?

2196
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,280
But no, it's Monday at the same place, so it's not the press conference, it's the same

2197
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:00,760
place and it's called the Natal reveal or whatever.

2198
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:04,760
And if it's not, I'm sure I've gotten a text about it now saying, oh crap, you guys, it's

2199
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:06,800
tonight, not tomorrow.

2200
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,240
Yeah, exactly.

2201
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:12,880
So I don't know what that's all about, but they're doing it.

2202
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,200
Black Wolf's like, are you sure?

2203
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,600
Yeah, I saw that.

2204
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:21,280
I'm as sure as I can be without actually being there and seeing the tickets, but my contact,

2205
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,280
you know, I trust.

2206
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,560
Megalotov in a space poncho says yes, it's true.

2207
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,560
All right.

2208
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:27,560
Anyway.

2209
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:28,560
Are you sure you're positive?

2210
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,560
Okay.

2211
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:30,560
Come on.

2212
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,560
Let's, let's move on.

2213
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:32,560
All right.

2214
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,560
Other stuff.

2215
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:34,560
Civilization five has a release date.

2216
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:35,560
Yay.

2217
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:36,920
September 21st is when Civ five is coming out in North America.

2218
01:43:36,920 --> 01:43:40,760
24th is when it will come out internationally, which means it will be pirated internationally

2219
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,520
on the 21st.

2220
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,840
This is the civilization that has hexagons in it.

2221
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,080
Basically there'll be more information at E3 next week.

2222
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:51,320
You know, I'm going to be checking this out because I loves me some civilization.

2223
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:52,960
All right.

2224
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,920
Duke Nukem Manhattan project is a real, it's coming to Xbox live for 10 bucks on June 23rd.

2225
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,280
A little trailer hit the internet this week.

2226
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,160
And uh, I believe what, this is a 2d game, right?

2227
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:06,240
So this is actually kind of retro graphics.

2228
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,240
Yeah.

2229
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,600
So it's 3d, but it's a 2d side-scroller action.

2230
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,440
It's kind of where the 2d games are going these days, right?

2231
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:20,880
That's cool, but it's not Duke Nukem forever.

2232
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,800
Let's still kind of be, cause if you remember Duke Nukem's roots were a 2d game.

2233
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:27,320
I think a lot of people forget that Duke Nukem was a 2d game first.

2234
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:29,240
Where's my Halloween Harry remake.

2235
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:33,080
It's a good day to die.

2236
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,080
All right.

2237
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,080
Good stuff.

2238
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,680
You may remember, and since this isn't our show roll, I'll talk about it.

2239
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:44,120
You may remember there was a lawsuit filed against the people working on Duke Nukem forever

2240
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:47,960
because they took too damn long and uh, that's been settled.

2241
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:52,640
So perhaps Duke Nukem news in the future, maybe?

2242
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:56,880
And actually, um, I don't remember if we can get into that later.

2243
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:57,880
Nevermind.

2244
01:44:57,880 --> 01:44:58,880
Oh no, no, no, we're not.

2245
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,160
Um, actually, uh, one other thing, uh, kind of going back to when we were talking about

2246
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:11,800
Rock Band 3, uh, there was also, remember, a lawsuit, um, against, uh, MTV games and

2247
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:15,880
harmonics for, uh, Rock Band and from Gibson.

2248
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:20,920
And that's been settled because you know who's making the super pro, uh, guitar controller?

2249
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:21,920
Gibson.

2250
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,920
So.

2251
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,960
Here's a random game.

2252
01:45:25,960 --> 01:45:29,200
Super Dimension Game Neptune apparently is a new game coming out.

2253
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,920
It's a Japanese role playing game.

2254
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:34,480
It's about game consoles who transform into anime girls.

2255
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,180
I am not making this up.

2256
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:40,220
It stars such people as Purple Heart, Green Heart, White Heart, and Black Heart.

2257
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:41,720
That's so, uh, imaginative.

2258
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:47,120
Uh, they're gonna fight Magicon, which I guess is the villain in the game.

2259
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:50,680
It's basically like, um, an R4 device type thing.

2260
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:53,360
Well, it's, uh, Nippon Ichi who does Disgaea.

2261
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:54,360
They are a part of this.

2262
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:55,360
So is Compile Heart.

2263
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,560
Uh, they do Agarest Reward.

2264
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,480
Uh, lots of interesting things there.

2265
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,960
Apparently classic Sega characters are supposed to show up in the game.

2266
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,120
Space Harrier, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd are like the summons in this game from the Nettoons.

2267
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:09,120
That's awesome.

2268
01:46:09,120 --> 01:46:10,120
And apparently, here's the thing.

2269
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,120
I'm getting this.

2270
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:13,280
You can also use images from your Playstation 3 photo library.

2271
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,280
I'm getting this.

2272
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:17,080
It's a PS3 exclusive, which means region free, kids.

2273
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:18,080
I'm getting this.

2274
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,080
Sounds pretty awesome.

2275
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:22,860
Wasn't the Neptune a code name for one of the Sega systems anyways?

2276
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:23,860
That's kind of ironic.

2277
01:46:23,860 --> 01:46:24,860
I believe it was.

2278
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:25,860
Yes, it was.

2279
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:26,860
Good stuff.

2280
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:30,560
Uh, the Dreamcast's code name.

2281
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,440
Uh, Marissa Congusto in chat.

2282
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,440
Hi Marissa.

2283
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,720
Says Gibson, referring to the earlier story.

2284
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,720
Gibson?

2285
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:40,800
Does that mean it's going to be insanely expensive and elitist?

2286
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:41,800
Yes.

2287
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,800
Yes.

2288
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:47,240
Let's get into some more gaming news and talk about some of the other big news that came

2289
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:48,240
up this week.

2290
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,480
Believe it or not, we haven't covered it all.

2291
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:52,760
Uh, big announcements out of one studio here locally, right?

2292
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:53,760
Yeah.

2293
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,120
So games has announced that they're going to be doing some more episodic games.

2294
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:02,820
One franchise they are now going to be creating games for is Jurassic Park.

2295
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:07,120
They have struck a deal with NBC Universal to develop games based on the media giant's

2296
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:12,360
properties and Michael Crichton's, you know, dinosaurs in a modern day franchise being

2297
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:15,360
the first to get the interactive treatment.

2298
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:19,360
You know, I wonder if since they've striked a deal with NBC Universal, if we'll get like

2299
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:22,040
an office game or something like that.

2300
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,080
An episodic office thing.

2301
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,800
I actually really like this music.

2302
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:31,000
I love the music in Jurassic Park, which is great because like it's such a terrorist like

2303
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,520
movie, not like actually about terrorists, but those dinosaurs like rip people in half

2304
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,920
and listen to the music.

2305
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,640
I was like, did you ever read the book?

2306
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:45,160
I did actually, believe it or not, I read the original Jurassic Park book.

2307
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:48,560
I did not read the lost world, but I did see the movie because I thought it was weird that

2308
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,760
he made a book sequel to a movie because like different characters died in the original

2309
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:53,760
book.

2310
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,760
Yeah.

2311
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:55,760
Like everybody died in the original book.

2312
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:00,720
Like I can't like spoilers in the book died and then he's suddenly back.

2313
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,920
There's a six month thing on spoilers after six months.

2314
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:03,920
It's okay.

2315
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,840
And that let's see how long ago is that book written?

2316
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,840
Like in the eighties?

2317
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,320
Yeah.

2318
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:12,200
That's a very interesting franchise to bring back.

2319
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,200
Don't you think?

2320
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:17,160
I think they should do more movies to be honest, because granted the third movie sucked, but

2321
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:21,000
Hey, we're past that now it's been countless number of years, well, not countless, but

2322
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
a lot of years.

2323
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,440
Wasn't the fourth one kind of like held up in the works for awhile?

2324
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:28,680
But they should have, I mean, they had the whole thing where, Oh, the ship, you know,

2325
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:31,280
was on autopilot and landed on the mainland or whatever.

2326
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:35,120
And there's dinosaurs in there and maybe they, some of them escaped and now they're breeding,

2327
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:37,320
you know, that would make an interesting story.

2328
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:40,560
You know, dinosaurs on the mainland, you know, that'd be kind of cool.

2329
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:42,640
Jurassic park was actually kind of an awesome movie.

2330
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:45,460
Like I remember when it first came out, a lot of people didn't like it, but like kids

2331
01:48:45,460 --> 01:48:48,820
our age at that time, which had been like teenagers and stuff had my birthday party

2332
01:48:48,820 --> 01:48:49,960
centered around it.

2333
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,600
When it came out and we'd see it, we went, I, let me tell you how long ago this movie

2334
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:54,600
came out.

2335
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,600
You ready?

2336
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:56,600
Ready?

2337
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:59,860
I went to the dollar movies with my girlfriend to see Jurassic park and I had to hold her

2338
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:01,800
hand because she was so scared.

2339
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:05,720
Remember when the dinosaur is looking through like that diner door thing at one of the little

2340
01:49:05,720 --> 01:49:09,120
girls and he snorts, he snorts, like she screamed.

2341
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:10,160
It was so funny.

2342
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,720
Why is she afraid of snort?

2343
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,920
Well, I think she's afraid of killer dinosaurs that will rip her in half.

2344
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:19,120
Cause you remember the, the dinosaur like ate that guy in the toilet, sitting on toilet,

2345
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:25,400
sitting on another universal, uh, movie property that that's going to get the game treatment

2346
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,400
as well.

2347
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,200
And that's so awesome.

2348
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:33,440
Back to the future is getting some episodic games as well.

2349
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:34,600
That's kind of awesome too.

2350
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:39,160
What, what the hell tell tale like, and I mean that in a good way, like where the hell

2351
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,680
did this come from?

2352
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:45,920
Like all them nerds at telltale and I say that in the most loving and daring way, all

2353
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:50,480
them nerds at telltale must have been sitting in the boardroom one day going, all right,

2354
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:54,040
what like fucking nerdy, awesome things should we bring back?

2355
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:57,000
And somebody was like back to the future and somebody else said, fuck yeah.

2356
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,520
And there it was, where's day of the tentacle.

2357
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,160
We need more day of the tentacle.

2358
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,160
Back to the future.

2359
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:06,720
Wasn't that actually a point and click game back in the day?

2360
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:09,640
I seem to recall there was a Lucas arts back to the future game.

2361
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:10,640
I don't know.

2362
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:11,880
Wait, what did it have been Lucas arts?

2363
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:13,320
No, there was some sites.

2364
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:18,080
I thought there was, there was some side scrolling games on the NES that really sucked.

2365
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:20,540
But um, well actually the first one was all right.

2366
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:25,640
The second one back to future two and three was terrible.

2367
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:29,240
Well Jurassic park also had video games, which Jurassic park games were awesome.

2368
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,240
Yeah, they were really fun.

2369
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:33,200
I thought the super Nintendo one was scary as fuck.

2370
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:37,000
I liked playing the arcade when we sit in because I used to, I've several times found

2371
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
that machine on accident.

2372
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,280
I think that was fun.

2373
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,280
Pretty awesome.

2374
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,280
The arcade one is sweet.

2375
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:46,760
The, uh, super Nintendo one, which is kind of top down, they went to like almost a Wolfenstein

2376
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:47,760
mode.

2377
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,480
And then the Genesis one where you play as a dinosaur.

2378
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,280
That was cool.

2379
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,280
That was awesome.

2380
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:56,320
I love the super Nintendo one with that whole first person shooter thing.

2381
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:00,360
And then like the dinosaurs would just jump out of nowhere and like, although because

2382
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:04,360
the super Nintendo's capability was so limited, you had like this little tiny goggles thing

2383
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:07,960
on the screen to see it was, it was kind of sad.

2384
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,920
But it used surround sound.

2385
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,940
It was one of the first games I had surround sound in it, although I was too poor for that.

2386
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:16,320
I thought it was awesome that it was surround sound on.

2387
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:19,880
Is it pro logic, I guess, because you know, it only had stereo output.

2388
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:21,760
It was one of their old, old, old, old ones.

2389
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:25,900
I don't know if it was like simulated cue sound or whatever, but they, it was an old

2390
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:31,380
version of a, it must've been, um, pro logic cause that's the only, but obviously now it's

2391
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:32,380
coming from telltale.

2392
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:35,160
It's probably gonna be more of a point and click games will be nothing like any of those

2393
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,160
games.

2394
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:41,800
But it was pro logic cause I remember, um, running it through our, uh, our receiver.

2395
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:44,240
So good time to the back to the future game.

2396
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,280
I mean, there's, there's gonna be a lot of love for that.

2397
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:47,280
Excited about that.

2398
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:50,720
He told me last night and he was looking pretty giddy.

2399
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:54,680
Dude, you need to get Christopher Lloyd in and record a bunch of voice work because that

2400
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,600
guy is not getting any younger.

2401
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,720
Good idea.

2402
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:02,840
Same, you know, with Michael J Fox to get him in there in the studio cause he is not

2403
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,640
getting any younger.

2404
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,160
I have some trivia for you.

2405
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:11,360
We have about, well, we had for a while back to the future pinball table and if you look

2406
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:17,680
at it, Michael J Fox's face is not on it because he would not lend the, uh, his likeness to

2407
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:18,840
make the pinball table.

2408
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:19,840
That's right.

2409
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,560
It's like what happened with Paula Abdul in that American Idol game.

2410
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:24,560
Who was supposed to play him before it wasn't it Jason Bateman?

2411
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:28,280
No, it was Eric Roberts or something like that.

2412
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,920
It was, I forget.

2413
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,320
Yeah, no, Jason Bateman played the sequel Teen Wolf.

2414
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:39,800
Teen Wolf 2 and Teen Wolf, the TV series coming to MTV.

2415
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,160
Awful.

2416
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:46,160
Speaking of awesome sounding games coming out soon, there is a SpongeBob SquarePants

2417
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,280
MMO.

2418
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,280
Shoot me in the head.

2419
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,520
No, it's awesome.

2420
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:55,200
Here's my reply to that.

2421
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,680
What do you have against SpongeBob SquarePants?

2422
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,680
All of you.

2423
01:52:58,680 --> 01:52:59,680
What is your problem with SpongeBob SquarePants?

2424
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,680
It's dumb.

2425
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:01,680
I'm not interested in mental retardation.

2426
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:03,480
I don't have a problem with it.

2427
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,680
The show's okay.

2428
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:05,680
It just grows on you.

2429
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:11,960
When I flew to New York once, I watched SpongeBob SquarePants the entire way and it went a little

2430
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:36,440
something like this.

2431
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:40,040
SpongeBob SquarePants belongs to that whole time frame of Nickelodeon kid shows that were

2432
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,280
actually awful.

2433
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:44,160
Shut your mouth.

2434
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:47,340
It will be coming out in 2011, but here's the thing.

2435
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:52,440
It's coming out for China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and India.

2436
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:56,560
No word about it coming to the US.

2437
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,480
You will have an online store where you can purchase your own items, meaning it sounds

2438
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,700
like it could be a free MMO, especially considering it's being developed for the Asian realms

2439
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:07,000
where that tends to be the more popular method of development.

2440
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Awesome.

2441
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,320
Tell that to all the people in Second Life.

2442
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:15,240
DarkSakura, what do you have for us since y'all are hating on SpongeBob?

2443
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:19,920
I have something cool, actually cool kind of.

2444
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:27,320
Street Fighter IV might be having, well actually there might be a motion sensing Street Fighter

2445
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,000
game in the works.

2446
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:37,040
It was actually Yoshinori Ono, who's the producer of Street Fighter IV, was saying that it could

2447
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,040
actually happen.

2448
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:42,160
That he was interested in motion sensing ever since the Wii was launched, but he didn't

2449
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:45,280
think that Street Fighter fit the play.

2450
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,160
But he's still interested in doing something.

2451
01:54:47,160 --> 01:54:52,400
He mentioned something called wanting to do a Street Fighter fit or Street Fighter exercise.

2452
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:59,360
That's more of a motion sensing game, not necessarily a fighting game.

2453
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:06,200
So I have everything else Street Fighter, I may as well get that too.

2454
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:10,600
It's I don't know, I'm worried it's going to be in that same bin as like what was it

2455
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:11,760
Virtual Street Fighter?

2456
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:12,760
What was it Street Fighter EX?

2457
01:55:12,760 --> 01:55:13,760
Was that what it was called?

2458
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:14,760
Yeah, Street Fighter EX.

2459
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:18,240
That really terrible Street Fighter game, it was really bad you guys, really bad.

2460
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:19,240
I kind of liked it.

2461
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:20,720
I actually liked EX too.

2462
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:21,720
Really?

2463
01:55:21,720 --> 01:55:25,920
Yeah, I actually for a long, I managed to get it to run on a 486.

2464
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:26,920
Wow.

2465
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,120
The first EX, sorry.

2466
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,120
That's old school.

2467
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,820
We have breaking news Rob.

2468
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:32,820
Do we really?

2469
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:33,820
Yes.

2470
01:55:33,820 --> 01:55:35,160
I keep closing the theme song though, I'm not ready.

2471
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,200
You have to warn me when you're going to have breaking news.

2472
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,480
I just did.

2473
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:41,480
I gave you warnings.

2474
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:42,480
A few seconds.

2475
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:47,160
Alright, well hold on, we've got to wake up the orchestra and get them to warm up.

2476
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:59,520
Alright, here we go guys, breaking news.

2477
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:05,160
Starting from a credible source according to IGN, Retro Studios is creating a Donkey

2478
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,160
Kong title.

2479
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:11,560
That's right, the folks behind Metroid Prime are making a Donkey Kong game.

2480
01:56:11,560 --> 01:56:12,920
That's going to be weird.

2481
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:13,920
Huh.

2482
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:15,560
First person Donkey Kong.

2483
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:17,680
Okay, that could be interesting.

2484
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:20,280
I don't know how you feel about that.

2485
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,380
Do you have to play that with the bongo drums?

2486
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:23,800
There are no bongo drums.

2487
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,800
Like Donkey Kong?

2488
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,240
Do you think that might be a surprise announcement at E3 then?

2489
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:29,240
Perhaps.

2490
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:30,240
You know what's happening?

2491
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,440
People are overhearing shit at E3 now.

2492
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:35,040
That's what's happening is that you get all these nerds together and people who work in

2493
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,480
the industry and like people can't help but gossip with each other.

2494
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:41,180
Like one year, didn't we hear people talking about was the year that Activision acquired

2495
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:42,180
Red Octane.

2496
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:44,880
We totally overheard people talking about the acquisition and everything that worked

2497
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,920
for the companies.

2498
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:50,060
You never know who's going to be listening folks, just saying.

2499
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:53,080
People started acting goofy when they were wearing, you know, space ponchos.

2500
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:55,440
See, this is crazy.

2501
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,440
I deserve that.

2502
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:59,760
You should see the Donkey Kong game we're making.

2503
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,760
What's up with that?

2504
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,240
Pick an executive, take him out for drinks.

2505
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,240
There you go.

2506
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:10,160
Alright, Loki, what other non-breaking news, although it is recent news, do you have for

2507
01:57:10,160 --> 01:57:11,160
us?

2508
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:12,160
Then by the way, we're going to do a triple threat.

2509
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:15,040
We're going to do Twitter topics, mailbag, and FUs of the Week all back to back to back

2510
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:17,520
here in just a moment.

2511
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:23,120
As previously rumored, the Dreamcast games are making their way to the PlayStation Network

2512
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,960
and Xbox Live arcade.

2513
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,480
As digital downloads, in celebration of the 11th anniversary of the Dreamcast, I just

2514
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:35,400
think it's a convenient timing if you ask me, apparently one of the first games coming

2515
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,800
out will be Sonic Adventure.

2516
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:42,840
Also Crazy Taxi is confirmed to be coming as well.

2517
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,640
Sonic Adventure and Noah's definitely out.

2518
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:45,640
Crazy Taxi!

2519
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:51,720
Because Sonic Adventure already leaked out, just a hint.

2520
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,720
It's guys.

2521
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:55,880
We just need Jet Set and we're good.

2522
01:57:55,880 --> 01:57:58,720
And Phantasy Star Online, the first ones.

2523
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,440
Oh, that'd be kind of cool.

2524
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:04,760
That would be actually really cool if Phantasy Star Online kind of came back, but on Xbox

2525
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:05,760
a little bit.

2526
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,240
There's still private servers, Rob.

2527
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,920
There's Phantasy Star Universe, too.

2528
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:11,460
We don't talk about that terrible game.

2529
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,760
It's not that bad.

2530
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:13,760
It's awful.

2531
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,760
Ugh.

2532
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:17,760
Alright, every week we encourage you guys to send us emails.

2533
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,480
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read a few of them here live on air.

2534
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,480
Why?

2535
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:27,720
Because we can and we love you.

2536
01:58:27,720 --> 01:58:31,160
Now usually DarkSakura dives in and reads the emails, but because she's under doctor's

2537
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:33,440
orders tonight, she's not going to read the emails.

2538
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:34,440
I am!

2539
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,440
Muahahaha!

2540
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:41,080
Alright, but DarkSakura can feel free to comment, but she won't be criticizing spelling and

2541
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:43,920
grammar, sadly, because she can't.

2542
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:49,120
Alright, and plus I don't have good spelling and grammar, so I wouldn't be able to criticize

2543
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,120
you anyway.

2544
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:51,120
Let's get to the first email.

2545
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:57,120
The first email from our good pal, friend, buddy, RubbaBubbaBubba is emailing us because

2546
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:00,200
he wants to tell us about season two of The Tester.

2547
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:07,120
Now, I realize a lot of people gave The Tester shit, and somewhat rightfully so, but it wasn't

2548
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:10,000
as terrible as I think some people made it out to be.

2549
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,480
I think a lot of people who really criticized it didn't watch it.

2550
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,440
It wasn't the worst reality show I've ever seen.

2551
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:18,280
I mean, didn't one of those chicks on The Real Housewives get a spinoff show?

2552
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:19,280
Like...

2553
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:20,280
I think a few of them.

2554
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:23,440
When you're gonna hate The Tester, when there's that, I mean, just sayin'.

2555
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:27,720
So anyway, he wanted to write us to say, there is a casting call about to begin for season

2556
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:28,720
two of The Tester.

2557
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:35,240
The prize this year seems to be a one-year contract with Sony, and a $10,000 cash prize.

2558
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:38,360
Hey, Miklotov, I found you a new job.

2559
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:39,360
Yeah, right.

2560
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:41,800
W, you've always wanted to be on a reality show, right?

2561
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:42,800
You could do this.

2562
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:43,800
No, I'm just Survivor.

2563
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:44,800
Www.TheTester.com.

2564
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,800
Well, this is kind of like Survivor, but not really.

2565
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:52,360
No, but I know what being a tester is like, and I would not do that again.

2566
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:54,280
You just get the $10,000 prize and quit.

2567
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,840
But I don't know, you're in a contract.

2568
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:57,560
I guess that's true, huh?

2569
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:00,480
Maybe I could be really bad so they could break me of my contract.

2570
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:08,680
He also links us to a demonstration of the casting call at PlayStation-staging.gotcast.com.

2571
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:11,160
You wanna read the rules and all that stuff and get a video ready?

2572
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:13,220
I believe they're due any day now.

2573
02:00:13,220 --> 02:00:17,160
I'd like to see someone from OLR, even All Games, kind of get in on this, so I have someone

2574
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,160
to root for.

2575
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:20,160
But, uh, I won't hold my breath.

2576
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,000
I think it might be fun, though.

2577
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,160
Come on, those of you that are on fun employment.

2578
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:26,160
I could try, I guess, but I don't want to be a tester.

2579
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:27,600
Think about it.

2580
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:28,600
Reality show.

2581
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:31,440
Yeah, it's so much fun to play the same- I don't think Nellie would be supportive

2582
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:35,440
of you leaving her with the new baby for a few weeks to go film this tester show.

2583
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:36,440
That'd be dumb, yeah.

2584
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:39,760
Nobody seems to understand that you played, like, the same stage over and over again for

2585
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:41,560
eight hours a day for, like, a month.

2586
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:44,560
And you have to listen to the same song when you're doing steps for, like, a month.

2587
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,160
So- Yeah, if it's a good song, it's okay.

2588
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:47,800
So it's like playing Earth Defense Force.

2589
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:49,840
I still haven't played that.

2590
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:50,840
I know.

2591
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:51,840
I'm missing out.

2592
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:56,560
Another email in our mailbag at mailbag at orangeloudtrader.com from Shook.

2593
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,760
And Shook writes us, hi, OLR.

2594
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:03,880
I would personally like to thank Dark Sakura for encouraging me to go back and replay good

2595
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:06,480
old Metal Gear Solid for the billionth time.

2596
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:11,120
Oh, it's a listener sucking up.

2597
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:12,120
Just kidding.

2598
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:13,120
That's inappropriate.

2599
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:14,120
All right.

2600
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:15,120
Thanks to P- I'm just giving him a hard time.

2601
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:16,320
Thanks to PS1 Classics.

2602
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:19,520
I downloaded it and fell in love with it all over again.

2603
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:21,120
Now I'm going to replay the others, too.

2604
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:24,280
Thank you for the excellent Game of the Week bit from Shook.

2605
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:25,280
Good job, Dark Sakura.

2606
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,240
A pat on the back and a cookie for Dark Sakura.

2607
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:28,240
There you go.

2608
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:31,360
But it'll have to be, like, I don't know, like an herb cookie or something because she's

2609
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,800
on the natural thing.

2610
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,920
You can get raw cookies.

2611
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,920
What's that?

2612
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:37,320
You can get raw cookies.

2613
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:40,680
And keep in mind, I'm 70% raw.

2614
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:41,680
All right.

2615
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:42,680
Let's see.

2616
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,920
Also, going to an email from dumunny125.

2617
02:01:44,920 --> 02:01:48,320
This is our last email tonight, folks, and I'm- oh, this is going to be a great one,

2618
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:49,320
Miklata.

2619
02:01:49,320 --> 02:01:50,320
Hey, OLR.

2620
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,120
I'm finally sending this email because I got a droid now.

2621
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:55,280
Also, now I can listen to your live stream by means of a free app.

2622
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,280
Yay.

2623
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:58,440
You should have told us more information about that app because I always say there's the

2624
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:01,880
all games app on iPhone, but I don't know what to say for droid people.

2625
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:03,880
So no more Crackberry, but now I have a droid-diction.

2626
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:08,000
Anyways, I wanted to ask you guys about Oblivion 5.

2627
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,880
Now, actually, that would be Elder Scrolls 5.

2628
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,640
Let's just be real.

2629
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:17,120
It's Elder Scrolls, and Oblivion was the fourth game in Elder Scrolls, like Morrowind was

2630
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:18,760
the third and so forth.

2631
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,760
And why are you barfing over there, Miklata?

2632
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:22,360
We had this discussion.

2633
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:24,760
Yes, but we didn't have it on the air, so you need to repeat yourself.

2634
02:02:24,760 --> 02:02:26,760
Okay, let's have it real quick.

2635
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:27,760
All right.

2636
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:33,360
So, if you play, and if they have it there, Elder Scrolls 5, I said that I will throw

2637
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,640
up because I hate the Elder Scrolls games.

2638
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:36,640
Why?

2639
02:02:36,640 --> 02:02:37,640
They're great.

2640
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:38,640
They're boring.

2641
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:39,640
They're some of the best games to ever come out for the-

2642
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:40,640
Nope.

2643
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:41,640
You are.

2644
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:44,040
I would rather- Okay, this is what happened.

2645
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:47,120
When Morrowind came out, everybody was like, oh, it's the best game ever.

2646
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:50,180
I was like, okay, it's gotta be awesome.

2647
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:51,180
Everybody says so.

2648
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:53,440
I went to Blockbuster and I rented it.

2649
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:59,600
I returned it, oh, like an hour later, and they're like, oh, well, you can just get another

2650
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:00,600
game.

2651
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:06,160
So I got Unlimited Saga, and then I returned it like 20 minutes later, and I just didn't

2652
02:03:06,160 --> 02:03:09,080
care after that because both of those games were awful.

2653
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:13,840
But my point is, Elder Scrolls is so boring.

2654
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:21,000
I guess it's because I don't like the fact that you have the main story and you can do

2655
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
whatever you want.

2656
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
That's cool.

2657
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:28,320
But it feels a little bit too much like you can do whatever you want, so who cares about

2658
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:29,320
the main story?

2659
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,200
Why don't I just go kill this entire town, or I'll go be a vampire, or something like

2660
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:35,200
that.

2661
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:38,160
I just don't like them.

2662
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:42,840
I do want to get Fallout a try, though, but I don't want to ever play an Elder Scrolls

2663
02:03:42,840 --> 02:03:44,360
game again.

2664
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:49,640
So apparently this whole time, Bobby has been leading an effort to get Space Poncho to trend

2665
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:54,800
on Twitter, and he actually got some of the former Gamerscore blog people to start using

2666
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:59,160
Space Poncho, and all these people are now using the term Space Poncho on Twitter.

2667
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:01,160
That's awesome.

2668
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:04,120
We have to go get one tomorrow.

2669
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:05,340
I officially endorse this.

2670
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:09,440
If you have a Twitter, you need to make a post right now about Space Poncho with a little

2671
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:10,440
tweet thing.

2672
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:11,440
So we'll see.

2673
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:12,440
Oh, four new tweets just popped up.

2674
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,440
Look at that.

2675
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,120
And now to make the full circle, we need a picture of President Cat wearing the Space

2676
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:18,120
Poncho.

2677
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:22,320
Oh, good question from SalaciousPopInChat.

2678
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,000
Do you like other sandbox games?

2679
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,480
Give me examples.

2680
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:27,520
Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption.

2681
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,520
No.

2682
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:33,080
But my dislike for Red Dead Redemption is because I don't really like the Old West,

2683
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:34,280
so the setting just wasn't...

2684
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:36,460
So you just don't like sandbox games.

2685
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:37,760
You want your games to be linear.

2686
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:43,220
Yeah, which might be why I like Final Fantasy XIII so much, because I go forward and I can

2687
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:45,440
just attack enemies, and I don't have to do much else.

2688
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:47,520
All right, let me go back to Damani's email here.

2689
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,880
Now, I've never played Oblivion IV until after I played Fallout 3, but I still am really

2690
02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:52,880
far into the game.

2691
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:55,880
I was wondering if they'll ever make a fifth Oblivion, because it seems like they're focusing

2692
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:57,400
more on Fallout games now.

2693
02:04:57,400 --> 02:05:00,080
Now, I do like Fallout more than Oblivion, but it seems like...

2694
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:01,460
By the way, do you like Fallout?

2695
02:05:01,460 --> 02:05:02,460
I haven't played it yet.

2696
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:05,920
I avoided it, because people compared it to Elder Scrolls games.

2697
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:07,440
It's basically Elder Scrolls with guns.

2698
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,440
Which might be better.

2699
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:11,200
Now, I do like Fallout more than Oblivion.

2700
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:13,240
There's less people that really have wanted to do a fifth one.

2701
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:16,400
It just seems like no one ever talks about Oblivion, so Bethesda doesn't see it selling

2702
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:17,400
that good.

2703
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:19,200
No, I think you might be wrong, buddy.

2704
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:21,200
I think it did sell very well.

2705
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:25,960
I just think those games take years and years to develop.

2706
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:28,080
There was a rumor about an MMO based on Oblivion.

2707
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:29,880
Yeah, that came out in court documents.

2708
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:34,000
Anyway, that's why I think it's not happening for a while and I was just wondering how much

2709
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
you wanted the fifth one.

2710
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I want it very badly.

2711
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Oh, and one last thing.

2712
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:40,240
I signed up for the O.L. Army in the big battle at all games, and I think we need a battle

2713
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:41,240
cry.

2714
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:43,120
A battle hymn or song.

2715
02:05:43,120 --> 02:05:44,120
And a slogan.

2716
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:47,000
Now, a slogan would be like, Fight for Ferity Justice.

2717
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,500
A battle cry could be like, For the Ferret.

2718
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:50,640
Those are just examples.

2719
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:52,120
I'm not sure what to do for the song.

2720
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:54,160
Well, time for me to be hitting the old dusty trail.

2721
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:55,880
I hope we get more people for the battle.

2722
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:59,280
I'll be serving a tour of duty for O.L.R. and Battlefield Bad Company 2.

2723
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,280
Thank God.

2724
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,560
I'm glad somebody's representing us in that, because I don't own that game.

2725
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:03,560
Thank God.

2726
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:06,240
Hats off to you, and I hope more people sign up for the Battlefield Bad Company 2 thing

2727
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:07,240
on the 26th.

2728
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:08,240
I don't know.

2729
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:10,000
Do we have a battle cry that we could have?

2730
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,280
We need to think about that.

2731
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,000
Chatters, I put that to you, too.

2732
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,480
What should the battle cry be for the O.L. Army in the big battle?

2733
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:20,520
And please remember, guys, for the Horde, please remember, guys, remember the number

2734
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:23,600
one rule of the O.L. Army when you do participate in this event.

2735
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:25,520
Don't be a dick.

2736
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:28,560
We like all these guys that are participating in it, so don't be a dick.

2737
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:29,880
It's just a fun thing.

2738
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:30,880
It's a fun, stupid thing.

2739
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:31,880
It's like the Olympics.

2740
02:06:31,880 --> 02:06:36,080
It promotes peace and harmony and a little bit of spirited competition.

2741
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,080
That's what it's all about.

2742
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,880
It's the Olympics of video games.

2743
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:40,840
But only all games is invited.

2744
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:41,840
Alright.

2745
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:43,120
Let's see.

2746
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:47,440
Oh, reject false icons is possibly a battle cry that's being suggested.

2747
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:48,440
That's a good one.

2748
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:49,440
I like that from SSJ100Matt.

2749
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:50,440
Alright.

2750
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:51,920
That was it for the mailbag.

2751
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:52,920
Mailbag out.

2752
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,240
Orangelaungerator.com if you would like to contribute more in the future.

2753
02:06:55,240 --> 02:06:57,200
For now, we're going to get a little bit angsty.

2754
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:58,200
Grrarg.

2755
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,200
Dark Sakura.

2756
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,200
Um, F.U.

2757
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:01,200
To not have your voice.

2758
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:02,200
Loki.

2759
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:24,400
Um, F.U. to people on eBay to demand more money after an auction closes.

2760
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:27,400
That's not how eBay works, stupid.

2761
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:32,520
F.U. to the fact that I'm getting sick the day before E3.

2762
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,520
Dammit.

2763
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,520
People at all?

2764
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:41,680
F.U. to Roseville Golf Land for their crappy taking care of their beautiful Technica machine

2765
02:07:41,680 --> 02:07:44,480
and for their 16 year old employees that are gone.

2766
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:46,320
Well, there's a lot of angst tonight.

2767
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,280
I think you guys did a very good job with your angst tonight.

2768
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:52,760
We are going to get back into some gaming news, but for some reason I forgot to put

2769
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:54,660
on our little list of things we're going to do tonight.

2770
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:58,400
The Twitter topics, we don't want to ignore Twitter.

2771
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:03,480
So here we go, we're going to go to Twitter topics right now.

2772
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:08,520
Are you tapping along on your microphone?

2773
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:10,000
We gotta hear that.

2774
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,160
No, that's okay.

2775
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:13,520
It is a very catchy song.

2776
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:15,720
I don't know why, but this song makes me think of Twitter.

2777
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:19,160
It's kind of like tweet, tweet, tweet.

2778
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:20,160
I don't know.

2779
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:22,600
Alright, let's go to the Twitter topics here.

2780
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:27,160
Again, twitter.com slash O.L.R. you guys need to follow us on there immediately.

2781
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:30,200
Tigerclaw305, oh he always loves to send us stories.

2782
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:33,400
Gears of War art director makes an unreal movie pitch.

2783
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:35,720
I'd heard about this just before tonight's show.

2784
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:38,680
Apparently the Mortal Kombat wasn't the only movie pitch to happen this week.

2785
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:42,940
Jerry O'Flaherty, which is the art director for the original Gears of War, he apparently

2786
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:48,800
has done a pitch for a film called Samurai, but I guess it's based off Unreal and you

2787
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:53,880
can actually look at a little clip right here, which there's one on the internet.

2788
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:58,480
You know this is all artsy, it's kind of got that comic book-y look like 300 had a little

2789
02:08:58,480 --> 02:08:59,480
bit.

2790
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:01,440
That could be cool.

2791
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:06,400
I don't know though, haven't movies based on video games like really not done well?

2792
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:10,560
Like Prince of Persia did not do as well as they thought, huh?

2793
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:12,600
That's kind of sad.

2794
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:16,640
Ray Ayanami sent us a link here about Arcade Infinity closing down.

2795
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:21,360
No, not before I can go play Technica, why is everybody against me?

2796
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:25,880
This is apparently, well I don't think it's happened yet, but this is an extensive story

2797
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:30,360
that's coming from a website shoryuking.com that I guess is talking about the possibility

2798
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:32,680
about Arcade Infinity closing down.

2799
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:33,680
I don't know what's going on.

2800
02:09:33,680 --> 02:09:39,680
Just another week and then I don't care, I guess I'm heartless.

2801
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:43,000
Yeah apparently you say no one wants to come to the arcades, I've lost 40% of my customers

2802
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:47,360
in revenue and it's due to the home console releases of games.

2803
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:50,320
Every month in Japan, 20 arcades close down.

2804
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:53,280
Right now Japan doesn't have any good games to release, Japan still has a lot of games

2805
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,280
to develop.

2806
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:58,120
Interesting, but it doesn't say anything about whether for sure this arcade is shutting down

2807
02:09:58,120 --> 02:09:59,120
or not.

2808
02:09:59,120 --> 02:10:02,440
That's the part that's kind of like getting me here, but I guess, I don't know, it kind

2809
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:06,920
of said here near the end, I can't read this whole story, it's like a feature here, but

2810
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:11,800
they do intend to keep the arcade open strictly for the same reason he goes to work, the people.

2811
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:13,560
He knows most of the people out there are like a friend.

2812
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:16,400
The arcade to me is a business, but the people out there are now my friends.

2813
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,640
I get excited for the games that are played.

2814
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:21,240
So he doesn't say it's closing yet.

2815
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:26,720
That mentality closed all of the arcades back in Wichita.

2816
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:27,720
It was kind of sad.

2817
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:31,400
I hope they don't actually close, that would be sad.

2818
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:35,720
Let's see, TigerClaw sent us another link, I'll let him have two tweets tonight because

2819
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:36,720
I'm nice.

2820
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:40,560
Capcom will add Playboy advertising in Dead Rising 2 apparently is one of the big things.

2821
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,480
Yes, there are magazines and actual magazine pictures on the wall and then actual magazines

2822
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:46,200
you can pick up that are Playboy.

2823
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:52,160
But this whole inserting product placement or what have you in video games is kind of

2824
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:55,560
starting to become more and more of a trend, yet another way to make money off of games

2825
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:56,840
besides the $10 thing.

2826
02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:02,760
We saw the Alan Wake this morning had the sink for the cars.

2827
02:11:02,760 --> 02:11:06,760
I don't know exactly what it's called beyond sink, but that was in there.

2828
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:10,800
So now the Playboy bunny will show it up in the game along with some sexy ladies on the

2829
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:11,800
cover of the magazines.

2830
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:12,800
There you go.

2831
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:13,800
She's not wearing a bra.

2832
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:14,800
You know that, Miklata?

2833
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,800
She has no bra on.

2834
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:16,800
I have bad eyes, I can't tell.

2835
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:17,960
Well, I was just letting you know.

2836
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:18,960
Pretty glad about that.

2837
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,000
She's gonna have saggy boobs when she's old.

2838
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,440
Because she's not wearing a bra?

2839
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:27,080
That's why women wear a bra.

2840
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:32,220
Well, we don't want to know her when she's old, we just want to know her now.

2841
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:38,440
Ray Ayanami wants to send us this story about Death Smiles, apparently is getting a US localization.

2842
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:40,480
It's gonna be coming out later this June by Axis.

2843
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:46,140
It was originally developed by CAVE, they did Don Donpachi, Espagluta, and all these

2844
02:11:46,140 --> 02:11:47,140
fun games.

2845
02:11:47,140 --> 02:11:49,080
Yeah, there's gonna be a localization.

2846
02:11:49,080 --> 02:11:51,440
The game is in English, hooray, Death Smiles.

2847
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:56,840
It's coming out in a limited edition set with a faceplate and soundtrack.

2848
02:11:56,840 --> 02:11:58,280
Nice.

2849
02:11:58,280 --> 02:12:01,720
Alright, that's gonna do it for Twitter Topics tonight.

2850
02:12:01,720 --> 02:12:04,600
Again, twitter.com slash olr if you want to send us some tweets.

2851
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:09,440
Show us your tweets a little bit, like the ladies in the Playboy magazine like to do.

2852
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:11,600
Alright, let's get back into some news.

2853
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:12,600
Loki.

2854
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:15,600
Those would be teats, though, that they're showing.

2855
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:16,600
Yeah.

2856
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:17,600
Sorry.

2857
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:26,960
Anyways, so there was a trademark lawsuit filed against EA Sports Active by website

2858
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:27,960
active.com.

2859
02:12:27,960 --> 02:12:36,280
Apparently they think that they're famous and that, you know, that apparently people

2860
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:39,320
might be confused that it's actually something from active.com.

2861
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:48,060
Honestly, before this lawsuit, I did not know there was an active.com, so eh.

2862
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:52,160
So we'll have to see what happens or what that's gonna do with EA Sports Active 2, which

2863
02:12:52,160 --> 02:12:54,080
will be out this fall.

2864
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:57,360
I don't know.

2865
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:02,040
That sounds stupid.

2866
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:03,040
More lawsuits.

2867
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:04,040
This is America.

2868
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:05,040
God bless America.

2869
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,520
Active.com wants some money.

2870
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,040
Sorry I was a little bit of dead air there.

2871
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:10,520
I was looking at Space Poncho tweets on Twitter.

2872
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:13,760
Because apparently somebody actually made a Twitter account called Space Poncho now.

2873
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,760
How long did that take?

2874
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:15,760
Like five seconds.

2875
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:18,280
A++ to whatever All Games Listener did that.

2876
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:20,400
If it wasn't All Games Listener, it might have been somebody, I don't know.

2877
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:22,920
Some other people are having fun with that little title now, too.

2878
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:24,600
Alright, uh, oh boy.

2879
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:27,640
This game, I saw this actually originally, I don't know, no they didn't post earlier

2880
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:30,920
this week, but it also hit Destructoid.

2881
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:35,940
It's apparently a game called Hey Baby, and I'm not talking about the No Doubt song, no,

2882
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:41,840
this is a game called Hey Baby, where you play a woman who gets aggressively basically

2883
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:43,580
catcalled by men.

2884
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:48,000
They will say, hey baby, nice ass, or hey, I wanna fuck you, or whatever they're gonna

2885
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
say.

2886
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:54,800
And in this game, you take your aggressions out on these men by killing them.

2887
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,640
And then when you kill them, they turn into tombstones.

2888
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:58,280
That sounds like fun.

2889
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:03,080
It's um, it looked pretty awful, I gotta say, actually, from the little trailer I saw.

2890
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:07,160
I think the comment I posted on Oh No They Didn't when I saw the little graphics, I was

2891
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:10,800
like, I think Hexen in 1996 had better graphics than this game.

2892
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,640
There's actually a little trailer here we can actually look at here, there's a thing

2893
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:16,440
on Twitter here.

2894
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:21,040
It's payback time, boys.

2895
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:23,720
Graphics are terrible.

2896
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:33,760
I wanna see if we can get some of the, uh, I know you want it.

2897
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:36,840
One of those guys said God bless you, and you're gonna shoot him?

2898
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:39,280
That was a nice thing to say, that wasn't even, maybe you're only supposed to shoot

2899
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:40,280
the bad people.

2900
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:44,560
Some women are dopes, not all, just some, but like somebody saying God bless you, that's

2901
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,600
not hitting on you.

2902
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:49,640
You're probably ugly if you think that's the case, okay?

2903
02:14:49,640 --> 02:14:56,160
And then you shoot them and they turn into tombstones.

2904
02:14:56,160 --> 02:15:00,960
And the tombstones say such awesome things as I love you, and you should leave your man

2905
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:03,320
and come with me, and wow you're so beautiful.

2906
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:04,320
This game looks stupid.

2907
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:08,320
And yep, she shot the guy and said God bless you.

2908
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:10,840
Here's a flamethrower and stuff.

2909
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:14,760
Don't play this game, this looks stupid.

2910
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:20,200
Like I'm all for like woman power and stuff, but play Metroid.

2911
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:24,800
It sounded like it would be fun for just a little waste of time as a flash game, but

2912
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:33,880
that looked really dumb.

2913
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:34,880
That's funny.

2914
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,520
What, the game?

2915
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:37,520
Yeah.

2916
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:38,520
It just looks terrible.

2917
02:15:38,520 --> 02:15:39,520
It is terrible.

2918
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:45,040
I mean I get it, it's a nice concept for a game, it's funny, but it's just executed

2919
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:46,040
terribly.

2920
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:50,840
Alright, we're going to get into another part of the show here that, gosh, we have

2921
02:15:50,840 --> 02:15:57,280
not done this in a very, very, very, very, very long time.

2922
02:15:57,280 --> 02:16:02,120
But I'm excited tonight, we're going to bring back the Orange Lounge Radio Match Game.

2923
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:17,360
Yes, that's right, video game match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2924
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:20,320
By the way, some breaking news, and I'm not going to play the theme, but apparently the

2925
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:24,200
space ponchos just lit up green.

2926
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:26,200
Why are we not going to this tomorrow?

2927
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:28,920
I have to work, I'm sorry.

2928
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:32,640
I'm telling you, they're going to do the year 2000 thing.

2929
02:16:32,640 --> 02:16:36,320
Alright, okay, let's get into the match game.

2930
02:16:36,320 --> 02:16:39,600
The way the Orange Lounge Radio Match Game works, we're going to read some funny little

2931
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:43,280
sentences here, and we're going to try to fill in the blanks, and it's up to some contestants

2932
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:45,960
on the line who are going to try to match us.

2933

2943
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:29,400
Looks like we have a caller, somebody got through, hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio,

2944
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,400
who's this?

2945
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:31,400
This is X-Link.

2946
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:34,880
Well congratulations X-Link, you got through, you're our contestant tonight on the match

2947
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:35,880
game.

2948
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:36,880
Woo!

2949
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:37,880
Thank you.

2950
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:38,880
Give it up for X-Link!

2951
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:39,880
Hey, alright.

2952
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:43,960
Alright, we have some folks in chat wanting to participate too, so we'll get to that in

2953
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:48,200
just a minute, sorry guys who are calling right now, but we have somebody, so you don't

2954
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:49,200
get to play.

2955
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:54,280
We'll give it about 30 more seconds for our chatters to get their space ponchos in.

2956
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:57,360
Let me ask X-Link real quick while he's on the line, what are you really excited about

2957
02:17:57,360 --> 02:18:00,960
for E3 over this next week, is there anything you're really looking forward to?

2958
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:04,160
Space ponchos.

2959
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:06,280
They're demanding it, we have to get them.

2960
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:08,280
I can't go because I have to work.

2961
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:10,640
Cough a little more, sounds sicker.

2962
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:15,120
Alright, I don't, do I count these people that are saying ponchos in space?

2963
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:22,440
I don't know, alright, we'll count them, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10 people want

2964
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:23,440
to play.

2965
02:18:23,440 --> 02:18:24,440
You can pick a number between 1 and 10.

2966
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:25,440
Me?

2967
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:26,440
Miklotov, yes.

2968
02:18:26,440 --> 02:18:29,440
You can pick a number between 1 and 10 Miklotov because you're our guest.

2969
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:30,440

02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:52,440
Alright, any, oops, wrong music, hello, match game theme, hello.

2976
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:54,600
It's been a little while since we've done a match game here, it's a little bit rusty

2977
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:56,080
here at Orange Laundry Studios.

2978
02:18:56,080 --> 02:19:01,560
Ryan, do you have any words of discouragement for Zeba tonight, your opponent?

2979
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:02,560
I win.

2980
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:05,400
Alright, let's see what happens.

2981
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:06,400
Can't argue that.

2982
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:10,920
Alright, let me explain, let me explain how the match game works.

2983
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:16,200
We're going to be posting sentences with a blank in them, or reading them to you.

2984
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:21,160
Your job is to fill in that blank with a match, but X-Link, this is very important, don't

2985
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:26,200
yell it out right away, just say ding when you have an answer, and then we'll let you

2986
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,480
know when we're all dinged in as well, okay?

2987

Migglytov, I don't know what else to call him, DJ Max Technica not playing Migglytov,

2991
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:57,480
cause Arcade Infinity is going to close, and then on the drive back up Sunnyvale is going

2992
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:05,280
to burn down or something, and I just can't win, but I got cards, so I'm happy for that

2993
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:06,280
at least.

2994
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:10,240
Alright, Zeba's going to send me messages over private message, Ryan you'll get to yell

2995

super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive

3002
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:50,880

3004
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:13,640

3011
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:55,920
is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive

3012
02:21:55,920 --> 02:22:00,800
video to MTV, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they

3013
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:06,240
will be showing, XLink, what is your answer? Space ponchos. Space ponchos they will be

3014
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:11,400
showing, what a surprise that that answer came up, alright, Zeba says, they don't want

3015
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:17,320
people finding out about all the games they will be showing, what a serious answer, which

3016
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:23,360
means she's not gonna win, it's like the poor person on the show that gets booed, no don't

3017
02:22:23,360 --> 02:22:28,000
boo, it's a good answer, if it was a real game show, alright, that's alright, you never

3018
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:33,200
know, you never know, maybe Dark Sakura's like I'm sick, I don't wanna write funny answers

3019
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:38,120
tonight, Dark Sakura, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the

3020
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:42,840
watermelon smashing, watermelon smashing they will be showing, unfortunately that is not

3021
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:48,800
a match with space poncho, Loki, they don't want people to find out about all the, survey

3022
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:56,240
says, space ponchos, space ponchos, ding ding ding ding ding ding ding, Ryan gets a match,

3023
02:22:56,240 --> 02:23:02,800
congratulations, Ryan it's one, Zeba, none, that's okay Zeba, there's four questions tonight,

3024
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:07,680
you have a chance, Zeba just sent me a cry, emote icon, don't cry, it was a good answer,

3025
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:12,200
just, good thing there's no money on the line, alright, Miklotov, you wanna go next or you

3026
02:23:12,200 --> 02:23:15,680
want me to go next, I don't care, why don't you go next, this is because they don't want

3027
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:21,560
people to find out about all the, Wii ports, Wii ports they will be showing, is that a

3028
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:31,800
match with games, judges, half point, I give a half point too, half point, I actually think

3029
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:37,040
ports are games so I say games, alright I'm outvoted, a half point for Zeba on that one

3030
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:44,760
and judges rules are final, this isn't real like TV, alright, this has become my answer,

3031
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:49,920
this is because they don't want people to find out about all the, bukkake covered space

3032
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:54,280
ponchos they will be showing, oh, there you go, that's the surprise, that's why they have

3033
02:23:54,280 --> 02:23:59,600
to wear the splash zone there, is that a match with space ponchos though, he didn't say bukkake

3034
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:03,880
covered and I think that part is important, could be half point, cause the other half's

3035
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:07,680
bukkake, I don't know, what do you guys think, a half point for X-Link for bukkake covered

3036
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:13,800
space ponchos, he does say space ponchos though, what they're covered with we don't know, alright,

3037
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:19,060
alright, so a half point, a half point for X-Link, so it's one and a half to a half,

3038
02:24:19,060 --> 02:24:23,960
there you go, there it is, question number one, right there, how about question number

3039
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:28,800
two, you feeling good so far, X-Link you have a one point lead, I'm always feeling good,

3040
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:35,300
what are you talking about, and we made your opponent cry tonight, that's, I always make

3041
02:24:35,300 --> 02:24:42,160
my opponents cry, so that's nothing, alright, be nice, alright, here we go, question number

3042
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:52,240
two, did you hear, you guys are supposed to go what, let's try it again, did you hear,

3043
02:24:52,240 --> 02:24:58,320
the Mortal Kombat movie franchise might be coming back if one director gets his way,

3044
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:04,720
the reboot might be pretty cool, but the cast of Orange Lounge Radio really hopes that the

3045
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:25,040
director doesn't forget to have, blank, in the movie, ding, ding, ding, dark soccer

3046
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:32,960
ding, she meeked, she meeked, that was like a beaker type thing there, alright, alright,

3047
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:39,200
Zeba's got the trick now, she sent a not so funny answer, let's see what happens, X-Link,

3048
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:42,880
did you hear, the Mortal Kombat movie franchise might be coming back if one director gets

3049
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:46,360
his way, the reboot might be pretty cool, but the cast of Orange Lounge Radio really

3050
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:53,940
hopes the director doesn't forget to have, dinosaurs, dinosaurs in the movie, cause dinosaurs

3051
02:25:53,940 --> 02:26:00,720
in Mortal Kombat have so much in common, alright, it is Primal Rage, oh that would be an awesome

3052
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:05,800
movie, alright, Zeba says the cast of Orange Lounge Radio really hopes the director doesn't

3053
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:14,160

02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:34,760
to have, Cher playing Sindel, the chick with the grey hair, Cher, ok, can you imagine Cher,

3057
02:26:34,760 --> 02:26:39,240
I could with her voice, she could sing, and it would be like that, that whole little thing,

3058
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:44,000
I was watching Kathy Griffin earlier today, and I love her impression of Cher, you crazy

3065
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:38,480

3066
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:43,280
Kombat 2 where you could do the animalities, I was just thinking Jurassic Park and Mortal

3067
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:48,240
Kombat, why not, I mean, you know, they have to have something worth fighting, why not,

3073
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:26,880
Portal 2 got delayed until 2011 but in an exclusive statement to Orange Lounge Radio,

3074
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:34,920
Valve said, we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add blank into

3075
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:55,840
the game, ding, ding, ding, ding, we are so sad that Portal 2 got delayed until 2011,

3079
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:23,240
we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add space ponchos, space ponchos

3080
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:27,980
into the game, I want to point out, these questions were written like 2 hours before

3081
02:29:27,980 --> 02:29:34,160
tonight's show, okay, so we had no, I'm just saying, this is pre-space poncho era, that's

3082
02:29:34,160 --> 02:29:44,440
right, alright, Zeeba says, we forgot to add bouncing balls into the game, were there bouncing

3083
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:50,840
balls in Portal? There were the little angry balls, oh, that's right, okay, okay, alright,

3084
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:55,920
I see that, the personality spheres, yep, I remember that, alright, alright, well, let's

3085
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:00,800
see if folks here in the studio, the celebrities, remembered about the bouncing balls too or

3086
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:06,120
if they went for the obvious, alright, here we go, Dark Sakura, we had to delay the release

3087
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:11,640
of Portal 2 because we forgot to add unsaturated polyester resin, fiberglass surface resins,

3088
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:19,640
and volatile malted milk impoundments, what, it's part of the cake recipe, you're dumb,

3089
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:24,160
but I love you, when you find the cake, no, I know, the cake sphere, that's part of the

3090
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:29,240
pattern, you know, fish-shaped, you know, methyl something, I get it, nerd joke, it's

3094
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:52,960
we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add bukkake covered space ponchos

3095
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:58,360
into the game, I guess that's half a point for X-Link, isn't it, because it worked before,

3096
02:30:58,360 --> 02:31:04,800
right, alright, two points for X-Link, a half point for Ziba, there you go, alright, one

the space poncho, there you have it, dark sakura, I love it, let me post that, that

3109
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:46,160
is truly creepy, that makes me very happy too, let me actually, I'll just retweet that

3110
02:32:46,160 --> 02:32:50,880
so all our OLR people can see that, my sims game froze, I'm going to close it now, now

3111
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:55,520
everybody can look at that, twitter.com slash OLR, I went ahead and reposted that, that's

3112
02:32:55,520 --> 02:33:02,280
beautiful, alright, we got an answer here, let's see here, it was officially announced

3113
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:06,400
tonight that the new Xbox motion controller will be called the Xbox connect, damn it,

3114
02:33:06,400 --> 02:33:09,720
exclaimed Loki upon hearing this news, I had a super secret insider tell me to bet all

3115
02:33:09,720 --> 02:33:17,480
my money on Xbox, X link, thought long and hard about this answer, and I'm going to say,

3116
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:23,880
bukkake covered space poncho for the win, bukkake covered space poncho, I see what you're

3117
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:28,720
trying to do, let's see if it works, bet my money on Xbox, bukkake covered space poncho,

3118
02:33:28,720 --> 02:33:36,400
zeba has said, bet all my money on Xbox, pokemans, there might be some poking happening, let's

3119
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:44,560
see what happens, alright, dark sakura, told me to bet all my money on Xbox, space poncho,

3120
02:33:44,560 --> 02:33:49,520
oh my god, Ryan gets another half point, he's going to win this stupid game on half points,

3121
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:57,560
alright, loki, the Xbox, you know ironically enough, one of the original answers that dark

3122
02:33:57,560 --> 02:34:04,160
sakura usually uses, actually fits pretty well with this, so the Xbox propel, I almost

3123
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:11,300
had that, the Xbox propel, good answer, but not a match, Mikoltov, the Xbox motion plus

3124
02:34:11,300 --> 02:34:16,960
plus, the Xbox motion plus plus, I think I see what you're doing there, but not a match,

3125
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:26,520
and lastly, my name, they were going to call it the Xbox freestyle and pose, the Xbox fap,

3126
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:34,600
what the hell are they doing, what the freestyle and pose, this photo, it's of space poncho

3127
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:42,060
fest, it's these people that look like they possibly could be cavemen or something, looking

3128
02:34:42,060 --> 02:34:48,080
at this giant screen, there's no goats are there, no, oops, I don't know why but that

3129
02:34:48,080 --> 02:34:55,560
music seems oddly appropriate all of a sudden, that's some strange stuff, alright, anyhow,

3130
02:34:55,560 --> 02:34:59,920
that's going to do it for match game tonight, the final score is zeba, you got a half point,

3131
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:05,360
Ryan, xlink, you got two and a half points, xlink is our winner, yay, xlinks, good job,

3132
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:10,480
a round of applause, a good effort for zeba, yay, bet you lost, I'm sorry zeba, but good

3133
02:35:10,480 --> 02:35:14,640
effort, alright, at least you got a half point, most times these are complete shutouts, so

3134
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:20,440
good job, alright, xlink, as the winner, you get to plug anything you want here on the

3135
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:24,640
show tonight, and we will even post it to twitter, so send it to me as a private message,

3136
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:31,480
what would you like to plug on tonight's program, don't know, I didn't know about this ahead

3137
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:35,800
of time, so I really don't have anything to plug, alright, there you have it, good job

3138
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:43,760
xlink, yay, yay, he's plugging apathy, that's actually funny, I was just looking at threadless

3139
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:48,440
and there's a shirt on that says apathy, our country's leading cause of whatever, why don't

3140
02:35:48,440 --> 02:35:54,520
you plug orange lounge, or plug space ponchos, why don't you do that, there you go, space

3141
02:35:54,520 --> 02:36:01,720
ponchos, there you go, goodnight, night, alright, congratulations to xlink, our winner tonight,

3142
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:05,400
our completely apathetic, I did mention the prize up front, right, so he had like 30 minutes

3143
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:09,640
to think about that while that game went on way too long, alright, how many listeners

3144
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:13,920
did we lose during match game tonight, just out of curiosity, oh we gained some, oh, we

3145
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:19,300
might have to do the match game every week, alright, they just wanted to hear space poncho

3146
02:36:19,300 --> 02:36:22,920
said over and over again, they did, the people that download the podcast tomorrow, it's not

3147
02:36:22,920 --> 02:36:27,000
gonna be funny anymore after tonight, but now we're gonna milk it up for all it's worth,

3148
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,840
a couple more stories for you guys, then we open up the skype line to everybody, everybody's

3149
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:34,800
gonna get to call in on the skype line, but not before we have just a couple more stories

3150
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:42,880
for you tonight, Loki's gonna start it off here, space ponchos, space ponchos, shut up,

3151
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:51,880
uh, yeah, so, let's see, uh, it's kind of funny, they actually, what was the reading

3152
02:36:51,880 --> 02:36:58,080
here, power gig, another game, you know, which before the whole rock band 3 announcement

3153
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:02,520
of what exactly they're gonna have there, sounded pretty cool and unique, but it will

3154
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:08,480
also be out this fall, their guitar of course is actually gonna be an electric guitar, a

3155
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:12,620
real electric guitar, that also will have fret buttons on as well, the real difference

3156
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:16,880
between that and say, the rock band guitar is that you can plug this directly into an

3157
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:21,880
amp and actually play an electric guitar, whereas the rock band one, you know, you can

3158
02:37:21,880 --> 02:37:27,960
plug it into a midi controller and then play it, um, some of the artists announced for

3159
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:36,800
the game, they have Dave Matthews Band, Kid Rock, Eric Clapton, and um, doesn't say any

3160
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:42,160
other songs, but apparently, it's kinda cool they say, we think power gig is a much needed

3161
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:47,040
and much welcome game because unlike any others before it, it puts a real guitar into the

3162
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:53,120
hands of aspiring musicians, and we hope it inspires our fans and others to start playing,

3163
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:55,760
even when they're not playing the game.

3164
02:37:55,760 --> 02:38:00,400
Ironically though, while their guitar may be really cool, they released pics and information

3165
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:07,720
about their drum set, which looks like shit, and the reason why it's pretty crappy is because

3166
02:38:07,720 --> 02:38:13,980
you actually don't hit the drums, you hit above the drums, it's like playing air drums

3167
02:38:13,980 --> 02:38:21,360
I guess, which is kinda strange, I don't know.

3168
02:38:21,360 --> 02:38:24,880
I'm just excited we're actually gonna get to see this game at E3 this year, you know,

3169
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:27,200
because when they went to PAX, they didn't show anything.

3170
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:32,720
Um, yeah, I wish we'd see Scratch there too, that'd be kinda cool.

3171
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:36,400
They might have it for the iPad or iPhone or whatever they were saying.

3172
02:38:36,400 --> 02:38:39,640
I'd rather see the PC version, because that's one that's actually gonna be kinda similar

3173
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:41,200
to the console release.

3174
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:42,200
Yeah.

3175
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:47,280
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're gonna open up the Skype line at Orange

3176
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:54,680
Lounge Radio on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR, uh, it's not open yet, guys, haha, I like

3177
02:38:54,680 --> 02:38:57,600
how the calls start coming in like instantly, I'm sorry, I'm just looking at all the Space

3178
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:01,400
Poncho tweets, it's doing pretty good, it's doing pretty good.

3179
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:03,680
It's catching on a little more than President Cat, I think.

3180
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:07,680
It might actually, if the World Cup wasn't happening right now, it might trend, we would

3181
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:08,680
see.

3182
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:14,320
Uh, let's see here, moving on to one more story, guys, about a new game from the guy

3183
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:21,280
who was wearing a Space Poncho earlier, Itagaki, that's right, oh god, Tomonobu Itagaki, he's

3184
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:26,280
the guy who did Dead of Alive, Dead of Alive, Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden, and he's kinda

3185
02:39:26,280 --> 02:39:31,280
known for, well, tit engines, basically, you know, if you play Dead or Alive, tit and blood

3186
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:32,720
engines, that's right, good times.

3187
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:38,360
Well, he left Temco, and now he's at THQ, and they debuted the game that he is working

3188
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:40,720
on, it's called Devil's Third.

3189
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:45,520
It's from his new studio, Valhalla Games, and it's violence, violence, violence and

3190
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:46,520
gore.

3191
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:52,200
It's gonna be on the Playstation 3, and the Xbox 360, and there is a little trailer that's

3192
02:39:52,200 --> 02:39:57,600
kinda surfing around the internet right now, so we're gonna take a look here, at the trailer

3193
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:58,600
here for Devil's Third.

3194
02:39:58,600 --> 02:40:02,840
I just wanna see all the blood and violence in this.

3195
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:11,040
Aw, there's, oh wow, that shotgun made all the limbs explode.

3196
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:12,480
Yeah, there were chunks coming off.

3197
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:15,840
No more, that was kinda gross, but funny.

3198
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:19,440
See this is, this is cartoony, ahahaha, I like that, the machine gun, that's the guy

3199
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:23,640
that was flying up the building.

3200
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:29,000
It doesn't look like a bad game, I'm kinda surprised.

3201
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:34,000
See there's a girl in this, this is what the Hey Baby game should have been.

3202
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
There it is.

3203
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,440
The music kinda makes it more fun to watch too.

3204
02:40:38,440 --> 02:40:43,200
Oh, cars exploding, Loki, you could do some great YouTubes to this I bet.

3205
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:44,200
Devil's Third, looks like fun.

3206
02:40:44,200 --> 02:40:45,800
I bet we'll get to play it.

3207
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:46,800
Yay!

3208
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:49,640
And then decide it's not fun.

3209
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:50,640
We'll see what happens.

3210
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:55,360
Alright, uh, that's gonna do it for our regular stories tonight, but we might have some last

3211
02:40:55,360 --> 02:40:59,360
minute stories, I don't know, let's see if any last minute stories are on deck.

3212
02:40:59,360 --> 02:41:03,400
And then we'll get to the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3213
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:05,480
Loki, you have some quick stories here?

3214
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:07,200
Uh, nothing pulled up unfortunately.

3215
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:09,400
Well, luckily for you, we have a call coming in.

3216
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:11,400
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3217
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:13,640
Hi, this is Ray Iannami.

3218
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:16,200
Hi, Ray Iannami, what's on your mind tonight?

3219
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:21,400
Um, about the deskmoss we had posted earlier, I'm pretty sure I already posted something

3220
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:22,400
like that months ago.

3221
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:25,640
The point I wanted to make was the dialogue that they localized.

3222
02:41:25,640 --> 02:41:27,600
Like, did you see the screenshots?

3223
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:28,600
Yes, it was all in English.

3224
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:30,880
I thought I mentioned, like, hey, they made it all in English.

3225
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:34,720
Yeah, I thought it was this, I thought some of it looked familiar, but maybe, I thought

3226
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:38,320
maybe the release date was new and some of that, some new information, if you will.

3227
02:41:38,320 --> 02:41:45,920
Well, if you noticed, like, do you see, like, how all the dialogue was, like, localized?

3228
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:46,920
Mhm.

3229
02:41:46,920 --> 02:41:52,560
Yeah, apparently someone posted this on Shmups forum, and people pretty much exploded over

3230
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:55,160
it, just because of how badly it was done.

3231
02:41:55,160 --> 02:42:00,040
I mean, it kinda reminded me of, like, how someone would go about, someone in a forecast

3232
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:04,680
would go about dubbing a forecast anime.

3233
02:42:04,680 --> 02:42:05,680
Are you gonna get this game, though?

3234
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:07,560
Are you gonna get the deathsmiles game when it comes out?

3235
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:08,560
Does it look like something-

3236
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:12,200
Um, I've already pre-ordered it, I mean, yeah, the dialogue, the shitty dialogue doesn't

3237
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:18,080
stop the game from being any less playable, but it just worries, but I have a slight feeling

3238
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:23,180
that some people might remember the game for the dialogue and not for the gameplay, but

3239
02:42:23,180 --> 02:42:27,680
then again, it's a shmup, and no one really plays the game for a shmup for the dialogue,

3240
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:29,200
so I guess I'm not all that worried.

3241
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:32,520
You play for the bullets everywhere.

3242
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:36,040
Let me ask you another question, Ray, and I'm gonna ask this of all the callers tonight,

3243
02:42:36,040 --> 02:42:37,760
so if you're gonna call in to the show, be prepared.

3244
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:40,760
What are you most looking forward to about E3 next week?

3245
02:42:40,760 --> 02:42:43,800
Um, besides Space Pontius, I don't really know.

3246
02:42:43,800 --> 02:42:48,360
I don't really follow all the, like, big name stuff.

3247
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:50,360
I'm more of a niche gamer.

3248
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:52,480
Alright, well, fair enough.

3249
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:55,500
E3, I guess, isn't a big deal for everybody.

3250
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:56,500
That's alright.

3251
02:42:56,500 --> 02:42:57,960
Every gamer gets a voice, even when you're wrong.

3252
02:42:57,960 --> 02:42:58,960
No, I'm kidding.

3253
02:42:58,960 --> 02:42:59,960
Alright.

3254
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:01,800
Well, Ray, we're gonna let you go, so we can get some more calls, but do you have any last

3255
02:43:01,800 --> 02:43:02,800
thoughts for our listeners?

3256
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:05,800
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, uh-

3257
02:43:05,800 --> 02:43:10,200
I got into playing Escalade 2 this week, um, I guess I'll just, I don't know, talk about

3258
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,200
it on another call.

3259
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:13,200
Oh, okay.

3260
02:43:13,200 --> 02:43:14,880
Well, what'd you think?

3261
02:43:14,880 --> 02:43:17,240
Give us a quick summary of what you thought.

3262
02:43:17,240 --> 02:43:18,240
It's pretty fun.

3263
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:24,920
Um, it's kinda like a most bullet hell shooter, except being slowed down bullets, and among,

3264
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:28,320
like, other things.

3265
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:30,340
Did you like it, or pass?

3266
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:34,800
It's pretty fun, but I keep, like, not- I keep holding back from playing the game just

3267
02:43:34,800 --> 02:43:37,440
because of how difficult it is to play for score.

3268
02:43:37,440 --> 02:43:38,440
Alright.

3269
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:42,040
Well, uh, keep playing, and let us know, uh, what you think, alright?

3270
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:43,040
Alright.

3271
02:43:43,040 --> 02:43:44,040
Alright, take care, buddy!

3272
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:45,040
Alright, see ya.

3273
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:46,040
Later!

3274
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:47,720
Alright, we're gonna get some more calls here on the Skype line.

3275
02:43:47,720 --> 02:43:51,440
877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

3276
02:43:51,440 --> 02:43:52,440
Let's get to another call.

3277
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:54,440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3278
02:43:54,440 --> 02:43:55,440
Hello.

3279
02:43:55,440 --> 02:43:56,440
Hola!

3280
02:43:56,440 --> 02:44:01,600
Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio, quien es?

3281
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:04,960
Uh-oh, we have a bad call.

3282
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:09,880
Remember, call Echo 1-2-3 before you call Orange Lounge Radio, it's a good way to test

3283
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:11,840
your connection to make sure it works.

3284
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:14,920
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3285
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:17,600
This is Scarzo, what's up, Rob?

3286
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:19,500
What is up, Scarzo?

3287
02:44:19,500 --> 02:44:20,500
What is on your mind, buddy?

3288
02:44:20,500 --> 02:44:25,400
Uh, I just wanna tell Mikol Tov, you know, I jumped in my GMC DeLorean, I thought I saw

3289
02:44:25,400 --> 02:44:30,720
him on Friday night, I totally forgot to post that on the chat line, um, I saw somebody

3290
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:36,280
who was actually kinda bummed out about DJ Max Technica being down on Friday night, and

3291
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:37,760
you guys were there on Saturday, right?

3292
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:38,760
It's not just me, I guess.

3293
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:39,760
It's not just you, Mikol Tov.

3294
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:42,760
I could imagine that a lot of people would be upset about that, because it's supposed

3295
02:44:42,760 --> 02:44:45,000
to be a really, really good game.

3296
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:49,480
Let me tell you, Mikol Tov, straight up, dude, because Roseville Golf Land, um, Rob, go ahead

3297
02:44:49,480 --> 02:44:54,560
and fill in your input, uh, Roseville Golf Land is crap, by the way, here's the problem.

3298
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:59,480
They had a problem with the hard drive, this was when I started playing back in December,

3299
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:02,760
they were getting a lot of blue screen to death, the game was lagging, it was slowing

3300
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:06,560
down, it was just horrible, so the problem was, they would just have to restart it, and

3301
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:07,800
I can just keep going.

3302
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:13,520
Uh, it wasn't until, like, maybe a month ago, where it just blue-screened, they would restart

3303
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:16,800
it because they know I'm the regular over there and I will always play during Arcade

3304
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:21,280
Mania, and on, like, Friday, Saturday nights after I get off work, uh, the problem was,

3305
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:26,640
it runs on Windows XP, by the way, it starts up and it says that the program cannot start.

3306
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:30,720
For some reason, it was shut down incorrectly, also known as blue screen to death, and so

3307
02:45:30,720 --> 02:45:35,760
for over a month now, I've been just kind of sitting here chilling, but, uh, I needed

3308
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:38,760
Mikol Tov's opinion, is it worth it to get DJ Maxx?

3309
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:41,200
I mean, in comparison to BeatMania, is it pretty good?

3310
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:45,320
Oh, I like it about a thousand million times better.

3311
02:45:45,320 --> 02:45:48,960
You have to remember Mikol Tov is totally biased and partial towards Korean music.

3312
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:49,960
This is very true.

3313
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:53,360
In fact, I think he tried, did you try to get it in DDR here in America?

3314
02:45:53,360 --> 02:45:54,360
Korean stuff?

3315
02:45:54,360 --> 02:45:55,360
Yeah.

3316
02:45:55,360 --> 02:45:56,360
No, no, I just thought- I thought you tried to do that.

3317
02:45:56,360 --> 02:45:57,360
That'd be cool.

3318
02:45:57,360 --> 02:45:58,360
No, no, I might have.

3319
02:45:58,360 --> 02:45:59,360
I don't really know.

3320
02:45:59,360 --> 02:46:02,840
Weren't there, like, the- I don't know how much I'm allowed to talk about, but don't-

3321
02:46:02,840 --> 02:46:06,240
let's assume, let's, let's hypothesize you got to actually suggest songs for inclusion

3322
02:46:06,240 --> 02:46:07,240
in the game.

3323
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:08,960
Wouldn't you have written down a bunch of Korean songs?

3324
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:15,280
I think I might have, but I was more always leaning towards, um, 90s music, because who

3325
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:20,160
wouldn't want to do, like, you know, uh, Rhythm is a Dancer, but then it all ended up in Hardest

3326
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:26,240
Party and I was depressed, but anyway, um, yes, DJ Maxx, way more fun, in my opinion,

3327
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,240
within Beatmania.

3328
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:33,520
Um, it gives me a reason to play my PSP and, um, I don't know, it just- it's a really fun

3329
02:46:33,520 --> 02:46:34,520
game.

3330
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:38,200
Like, when, uh, Black Square came out, um, I got it home, um, because I sent it to work

3331
02:46:38,200 --> 02:46:42,240
and I swear I played that for, like, eight hours straight because it was just that much

3332
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:43,240
fun.

3333
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:47,680
Yeah, you've got Mission Mode, you've got, you know, really good songs and, you know,

3334
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:48,680
it's worth it.

3335
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:53,040
Um, I can't really throw my support too much behind the American version.

3336
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:59,680
It was decent, um, and it had a few good songs, but I would, if you're, like, new to the game,

3337
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:04,320
I would go with, like, you know, the classic Y slash Black Square bundle, if that's still

3338
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:05,720
around, because those are two really good games.

3339
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:08,880
Oh, definitely, and I mean, I'm trying to, you see, I'm broke and I work two jobs, so,

3340
02:47:08,880 --> 02:47:10,400
you know, I'm just making ends meet.

3341
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:14,560
I'm trying to get a PSP and, I mean, hey, don't give me a rest or anything, I'm going

3342
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:17,760
to try to mod it because the only version that we, you know, that I can get my hands

3343
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:20,360
on as of right now is DJ Maxx Fever.

3344
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:24,720
Yeah, and it's not a terrible game, it's just, there were a lot of problems with it that

3345
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:30,400
they have not released an update to fix, but, you know, you get some of the best songs from,

3346
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:32,720
uh, the first two games in it.

3347
02:47:32,720 --> 02:47:33,720
Definitely.

3348
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:37,200
If you can get it for, like, I don't know, ten or fifteen bucks, that's worth it.

3349
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:40,560
Um, I wouldn't pay more than, more than fifteen for it, though.

3350
02:47:40,560 --> 02:47:44,560
Okay, and did you hear about the, uh, Technica 2 soundtrack being leaked?

3351
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:46,960
Because I can't find that yet and that's a tough one.

3352
02:47:46,960 --> 02:47:49,800
The, um, just the limited edition version?

3353
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:54,640
Yeah, um, it's on a Korean website because I'm friends with some of the Sunnyvale Golf

3354
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:58,640
Land players because that's where most of the, like, top score, the elitist players

3355
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:02,320
are, and one of them got their hands on it and they were telling me about it and I was

3356
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:04,240
just like, man, I gotta look for that.

3357
02:48:04,240 --> 02:48:10,360
I bought through, um, a website, uh, the limited edition Technica soundtrack that came with,

3358
02:48:10,360 --> 02:48:15,480
you know, the card and the keychain and the soundtrack, um, and I actually have it with

3359
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:19,760
me too because it's a good card holder and I knew I'd get my hands on some of the Technica

3360
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:20,760
1 cards.

3361
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:23,440
Um, the soundtrack is crap, though.

3362
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:24,440
So I'm not really looking...

3363
02:48:24,440 --> 02:48:25,440
You know, I was hearing mixed reviews.

3364
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:26,440
Don't get me wrong.

3365
02:48:26,440 --> 02:48:27,440
I mean, I like the music.

3366
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:28,960
It's something new for my ears.

3367
02:48:28,960 --> 02:48:29,960
Don't get me wrong.

3368
02:48:29,960 --> 02:48:31,480
So, you know, I want to give it a shot.

3369
02:48:31,480 --> 02:48:35,240
Technica has way better music, Technica 1, and at least when Technica 2, if it's not

3370
02:48:35,240 --> 02:48:39,240
already out for real, um, it will have most of that Technica 1 music on it.

3371
02:48:39,240 --> 02:48:40,240
Um, I got...

3372
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:41,240
Oh, yeah, definitely.

3373
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:42,240
Definitely.

3374
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:44,040
I want to jump in here because I do have to wrap up and get to other calls, but I like

3375
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:45,040
this caller.

3376
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:46,640
He's got energy, he's local, he knows what he's talking about.

3377
02:48:46,640 --> 02:48:49,880
I know, and I can talk about DJ Max, and that's something I can do for hours.

3378
02:48:49,880 --> 02:48:51,920
I know, and so if I don't jump in here, that would be good.

3379
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:54,320
Hey, Rob, hey, Rob, this is your boy, Jay Hugo on Twitter, by the way.

3380
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:55,320
Not trying to put a plug.

3381
02:48:55,320 --> 02:48:56,320
Don't follow me.

3382
02:48:56,320 --> 02:48:57,320
I'm just saying.

3383
02:48:57,320 --> 02:48:58,320
This is your boy, Jay Hugo, okay?

3384
02:48:58,320 --> 02:49:01,640
All right, no, I appreciate it, and one of these days if I actually go to Roseville Golf

3385
02:49:01,640 --> 02:49:02,640
Lane again, although you missed it.

3386
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:03,640
I was there Saturday.

3387
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:04,640
We'll meet up.

3388
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:05,640
I know.

3389
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:06,640
What was I going to say?

3390
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:07,640
Oh, I'm asking all the callers this.

3391
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:09,440
What are you looking forward to at E3 this year?

3392
02:49:09,440 --> 02:49:12,280
Man, you know, okay, like, I'm not a big fan.

3393
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:14,080
I don't play fighters, but I love watching it.

3394
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:16,800
It feels like a competitive movie, Marvel versus Capcom.

3395
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:18,440
I got a bunch of friends.

3396
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:20,000
That looks pretty cool, in my opinion.

3397
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:23,480
I mean, I would go... If I could go to E3 with you, I'd be there for the bukkake, but

3398
02:49:23,480 --> 02:49:25,440
you know, that's another radio show.

3399
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:26,440
We can't be saying that.

3400
02:49:26,440 --> 02:49:27,440
You know what I'm saying?

3401
02:49:27,440 --> 02:49:28,440
Wait a minute.

3402
02:49:28,440 --> 02:49:29,440
Wait a minute.

3403
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:30,440
Wait a minute.

3404
02:49:30,440 --> 02:49:31,440
Are you sure you want that to be put in the podcast?

3405
02:49:31,440 --> 02:49:32,440
I don't know.

3406
02:49:32,440 --> 02:49:33,440
I'm just saying.

3407
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:34,440
That's permanent.

3408
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:35,440
I'm just saying.

3409
02:49:35,440 --> 02:49:36,440
I mean, you could go bleep me out.

3410
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:37,440
I'm just saying.

3411
02:49:37,440 --> 02:49:38,440
No, no, it's funny.

3412
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:39,440
It's funny.

3413
02:49:39,440 --> 02:49:40,440
All right.

3414
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:41,440
I like him.

3415
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:42,440
He's funny.

3416
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:43,440
We're going to have to get him on the show at some point.

3417
02:49:43,440 --> 02:49:44,440
All right.

3418
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:45,440
And the Technica machine will be working.

3419
02:49:45,440 --> 02:49:46,440
We can always have a good time.

3420
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:47,440
Good times.

3421
02:49:47,440 --> 02:49:48,440
Oh, yeah.

3422
02:49:48,440 --> 02:49:49,440
One quick thing.

3423
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:50,440
Platinum Crew is great.

3424
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:53,560
Technica 2, dual mixing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3425
02:49:53,560 --> 02:49:54,560
The interface is a little weird.

3426
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:56,760
Oh, I love that interface for two.

3427
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:57,760
It looks so nice.

3428
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:58,760
It is.

3429
02:49:58,760 --> 02:49:59,760
It's beautiful.

3430
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:03,160
But not as hot as the classical eye singer, the female, when she had long hair, though.

3431
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:04,160
Hoorah.

3432
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:05,160
That's what I got to say.

3433
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:07,600
Coming soon is going to be a new podcast, apparently.

3434
02:50:07,600 --> 02:50:09,680
Ironically, a music game podcast with these two.

3435
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:11,320
They're just going to talk for hours about it.

3436
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:12,320
I could do it.

3437
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:13,320
All right.

3438
02:50:13,320 --> 02:50:14,320
We're going to let you go.

3439
02:50:14,320 --> 02:50:15,320
All right.

3440
02:50:15,320 --> 02:50:16,320
I'll let your boy.

3441
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:17,320
I'll let your boy.

3442
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:18,320
I'll let you guys go.

3443
02:50:18,320 --> 02:50:19,320
Have a good night.

3444
02:50:19,320 --> 02:50:20,320
You know, first time calling.

3445
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:21,320
Thank you so much for everything.

3446
02:50:21,320 --> 02:50:22,320
And man, I've been missing out on the last eight years.

3447
02:50:22,320 --> 02:50:23,320
But I'm here now.

3448
02:50:23,320 --> 02:50:24,320
So let's keep it going, guys.

3449
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:25,320
All right?

3450
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:26,320
Glad to have you, buddy.

3451
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:27,320
You have a good one.

3452
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:28,320
He's a good guy.

3453
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:29,320
He always pimps our show on the Twitter and stuff.

3454
02:50:29,320 --> 02:50:30,320
Don't think I don't notice that stuff.

3455
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:31,320
I really appreciate that.

3456
02:50:31,320 --> 02:50:32,320
He's very enthusiastic about the show.

3457
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:33,880
Let's take another call from him.

3458
02:50:33,880 --> 02:50:34,880
Really appreciate it.

3459
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:37,080
No, we got to get to more other calls.

3460
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:43,440
But first, guys, I know you think I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's E3, I can't control

3461
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:53,120
when there is breaking news.

3462
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:54,120
Tom Brokaw here.

3463
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:55,120
Boo-kake.

3464
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:56,120
Anyway, no.

3465
02:50:56,120 --> 02:51:01,120
What I really wanted to point out was that it has been revealed that there is a Star

3466
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:02,120
Wars game.

3467
02:51:02,120 --> 02:51:03,120
We mentioned this before.

3468
02:51:03,120 --> 02:51:06,760
There is a Star Wars game for Kinect, and it has been announced it will feature controller

3469
02:51:06,760 --> 02:51:09,520
free lightsaber fighting.

3470
02:51:09,520 --> 02:51:10,520
You got...

3471
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:11,520
I know.

3472
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:12,520
How does that work?

3473
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:13,520
I don't know.

3474
02:51:13,520 --> 02:51:14,520
But here's the thing.

3475
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:15,520
You've got to love Microsoft.

3476
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:16,520
You've got to love them.

3477
02:51:16,520 --> 02:51:17,520
Well, you can hate them.

3478
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:18,960
But you've got to love them.

3479
02:51:18,960 --> 02:51:23,280
They don't even make it a secret that they just rip off other people's ideas and make

3480
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:24,280
it better.

3481
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:28,120
What has everybody wanted on the Wii since the first day people put their hands on that

3482
02:51:28,120 --> 02:51:29,120
controller?

3483
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,120
Lightsaber battles.

3484
02:51:30,120 --> 02:51:31,120
But is it going to be better?

3485
02:51:31,120 --> 02:51:32,580
Because you won't have anything in your hands.

3486
02:51:32,580 --> 02:51:33,580
It's like the videos for...

3487
02:51:33,580 --> 02:51:37,600
It isn't at all, you're supposed to be able to hold up an object, and that's your new

3488
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:38,600
thing.

3489
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:39,600
Okay, I'm going to roll up a piece of paper.

3490
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:40,600
There you go.

3491
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:41,600
For a toilet paper roll.

3492
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:42,600
You have a toilet paper roll that you just...

3493
02:51:42,600 --> 02:51:46,440
I'm just going to find a random object, like, I don't know, like a pie roller.

3494
02:51:46,440 --> 02:51:52,520
If you go to Kotaku right now, their top story there is showing the space ponchos, and they

3495
02:51:52,520 --> 02:51:54,760
have video of space ponchos.

3496
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:55,760
Oh, good God.

3497
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:56,760
All right.

3498
02:51:56,760 --> 02:51:57,760
God, our Skype line is blowing up tonight.

3499
02:51:57,760 --> 02:51:58,760
Sorry, guys.

3500
02:51:58,760 --> 02:51:59,760
We will get back to you guys in a minute.

3501
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:00,760
See that top point right there?

3502
02:52:00,760 --> 02:52:01,760
All right.

3503
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:02,760
This coming courtesy from Kotaku.com.

3504
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:04,080
I'm going to close all these people calling.

3505
02:52:04,080 --> 02:52:05,080
Stop calling for a minute.

3506
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:06,080
Leave me alone.

3507
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:07,080
All right.

3508
02:52:07,080 --> 02:52:08,080
Scroll down.

3509
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:09,080
Hold on.

3510
02:52:09,080 --> 02:52:10,080
I'm going to go into Do Not Disturb for a minute.

3511
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:12,580
We will open up the Skype line in just a moment, I super duper promise, okay?

3512
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:13,800
But this is very important.

3513
02:52:13,800 --> 02:52:15,320
We need to see space ponchos.

3514
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:18,200
Leave us alone.

3515
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:19,200
What is that?

3516
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:20,200
They are plant people.

3517
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:21,200
This is creepy.

3518
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:22,200
They're plant people.

3519
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:25,320
What the fuck does this have to do with video games?

3520
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:27,720
This is why we have to go tomorrow.

3521
02:52:27,720 --> 02:52:37,440
They're just, they're plant people moving around.

3522
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:38,440
They're-

3523
02:52:38,440 --> 02:52:42,960
Well, see, they're getting the idea across that you don't need a controller to play.

3524
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:46,120
You just need a really silly headdress and some robes.

3525
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:47,880
I thought there was going to be video of the space ponchos.

3526
02:52:47,880 --> 02:52:48,880
I thought so too.

3527
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:49,880
Not the plant people.

3528
02:52:49,880 --> 02:52:50,880
Fuck the plant people.

3529
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:54,440
There's, where's, where's bald dude in the space poncho?

3530
02:52:54,440 --> 02:52:55,440
That's what I want.

3531
02:52:55,440 --> 02:52:58,800
It's got to be really hot with all those people wearing the silvery space ponchos.

3532
02:52:58,800 --> 02:53:01,800
I wonder if you can go on YouTube.

3533
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:03,520
I love commenters.

3534
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:06,240
I was wondering if YouTube has some space poncho.

3535
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:08,200
No, they'd be on Twitter.

3536
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:15,880
I know our boy Bobby Black Wolf is monitoring the Twitters right now, and he will let us

3537
02:53:15,880 --> 02:53:18,480
know the incident of space poncho because he's trying to get the space poncho thing

3538
02:53:18,480 --> 02:53:19,480
to trend.

3539
02:53:19,480 --> 02:53:20,480
Hey Rob.

3540
02:53:20,480 --> 02:53:21,480
What?

3541
02:53:21,480 --> 02:53:22,480
Space poncho five.

3542
02:53:22,480 --> 02:53:23,480
Choo choo.

3543
02:53:23,480 --> 02:53:27,400
Uh, let's see, by the way, uh, comments from chat room here, Black Wolf is apparently also

3544
02:53:27,400 --> 02:53:31,800
read it as an on rails light rail, lightsaber game.

3545
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:33,360
Weird.

3546
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:34,360
I could be down with that.

3547
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:35,360
We'll see.

3548
02:53:35,360 --> 02:53:36,720
I don't care about Star Wars.

3549
02:53:36,720 --> 02:53:37,720
It's whatever.

3550
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:38,720
All right.

3551
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:39,720
I'm opening up the Skype line again.

3552
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:40,720
You can call.

3553
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:41,720
It's open.

3554
02:53:41,720 --> 02:53:42,720
Sorry guys.

3555
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:43,720
It's just, I had to stop and see the plant people.

3556
02:53:43,720 --> 02:53:44,720
Thanks.

3557
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:45,720
Loki.

3558
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:46,720
By the way, Loki starting a new blog, right?

3559
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:47,720
Loki.

3560
02:53:47,720 --> 02:53:48,720
You want to plug that real quick?

3561
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:49,720
Cause you literally started.

3562
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:50,720
We talked about it.

3563
02:53:50,720 --> 02:53:55,040
We talked about it last week, um, and there was some hiccups because as I mentioned in

3564
02:53:55,040 --> 02:54:01,600
my FUs, douchebag that I bought the PC from, um, wanted more money after the auction closed.

3565
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:04,080
He's like, Oh, I'm not selling it for this kind of money.

3566
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:07,260
I'm like, well you should have put a reserve price on it then.

3567
02:54:07,260 --> 02:54:12,080
And so he refunded my money and I gave him negative feedback after a strict, uh, scolding.

3568
02:54:12,080 --> 02:54:15,760
But I did find another PC for the same price, just six cents more.

3569
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:19,540
So a project under $100 is back on.

3570
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:26,780
It's basically a kind of a, as I put it, an experiment in frugality and engineering, um,

3571
02:54:26,780 --> 02:54:31,860
that's basically gonna, uh, be tasked in building a working MAME machine.

3572
02:54:31,860 --> 02:54:38,160
This is a PC in an arcade cabinet with arcade controls under $100.

3573
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:40,160
That's easy.

3574
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:41,700
You would think it would be.

3575
02:54:41,700 --> 02:54:42,700
It's not.

3576
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:43,700
We've done it.

3577
02:54:43,700 --> 02:54:45,080
Well, I know, but here's the thing though.

3578
02:54:45,080 --> 02:54:50,080
There, there are specific, um, instructions regarding this.

3579
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:54,640
Granted, you could find an old PC and old stuff and do all that, but I'm assuming that

3580
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:58,480
somebody doesn't have that and they have to buy everything.

3581
02:54:58,480 --> 02:55:02,400
Buying everything for under $100 a lot harder than it sounds.

3582
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:04,760
So donations don't count towards your under $100.

3583
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:06,400
Donations do not count.

3584
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:11,640
Everything must be purchased except of course, you know, construction materials like tape

3585
02:55:11,640 --> 02:55:14,280
or you know, glue and that kind of stuff.

3586
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:15,440
I'm assuming that you have that.

3587
02:55:15,440 --> 02:55:18,480
I was gonna say in my backyard, I have an empty arcade cabinet.

3588
02:55:18,480 --> 02:55:20,760
We have a ton of controllers and buttons.

3589
02:55:20,760 --> 02:55:21,760
Yes.

3590
02:55:21,760 --> 02:55:22,760
Yes.

3591
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:23,760
I'm basically, it's worst case scenario.

3592
02:55:23,760 --> 02:55:28,120
I mean, if, if you wanted to and you didn't have anything, could you do it under $100?

3593
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:29,380
And the answer is yes.

3594
02:55:29,380 --> 02:55:30,440
I gotta get back to the phones.

3595
02:55:30,440 --> 02:55:31,760
They are blowing up you guys.

3596
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:32,760
Did you give out the URL?

3597
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:33,760
Oh yes.

3598
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:38,460
Uh, the URL is under $100 at 100 is, you know, the number.

3599
02:55:38,460 --> 02:55:42,880
Under $100 mame.blogspot.com will be a link on orange lines later.

3600
02:55:42,880 --> 02:55:47,480
By the way, guys, we need a space poncho page on Wikipedia, like right now and get it created

3601
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:50,000
and then link it to all of us before our wiki.

3602
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Yeah.

3603
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:52,000
No.

3604
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:55,040
I think official Wikipedia should have space poncho both.

3605
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:56,040
Let's get to another call.

3606
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:58,280
We've got to try and blow these cause our, our phone lines are blowing up tonight.

3607
02:55:58,280 --> 02:55:59,280
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3608
02:55:59,280 --> 02:56:00,280
Who's this?

3609
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:01,280
Hey, this is Ingo.

3610
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:02,280
Hey, Ingo.

3611
02:56:02,280 --> 02:56:03,280
What's on your mind?

3612
02:56:03,280 --> 02:56:04,280
I'm glad we can hear you this time.

3613
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:05,280
What's on your mind?

3614
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:06,280
I want a space poncho.

3615
02:56:06,280 --> 02:56:07,280
Me too.

3616
02:56:07,280 --> 02:56:09,360
Sadly, I have to work tomorrow.

3617
02:56:09,360 --> 02:56:10,360
Boohoo.

3618
02:56:10,360 --> 02:56:11,360
All right.

3619
02:56:11,360 --> 02:56:12,360
What if you're sick?

3620
02:56:12,360 --> 02:56:13,360
What's on your mind?

3621
02:56:13,360 --> 02:56:16,360
What the hell is going on with these Microsoft pictures?

3622
02:56:16,360 --> 02:56:18,520
Like cavemen that are emo.

3623
02:56:18,520 --> 02:56:21,440
Wait, cavemen that are emo, Microsoft?

3624
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:23,440
Are you talking about the pictures from the event or what?

3625
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:27,040
Yeah, it's the one where they're like, it's like on a hill and they're like, there's the

3626
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:29,840
big old logo there and there's a TV or something.

3627
02:56:29,840 --> 02:56:32,480
Cirque du Soleil is like that modern art thing.

3628
02:56:32,480 --> 02:56:33,480
You know what?

3629
02:56:33,480 --> 02:56:37,120
Wouldn't you be emo if you didn't have fire?

3630
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:41,240
I would be emo if my space poncho wasn't changing colors like I, you know, it's supposed to.

3631
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:44,320
Imagine if the space ponchos glowed blue.

3632
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:47,360
You're just giving me more reason for, to make you call in sick tomorrow.

3633
02:56:47,360 --> 02:56:48,840
No, calling in sick tomorrow.

3634
02:56:48,840 --> 02:56:49,840
All right.

3635
02:56:49,840 --> 02:56:51,680
Uh, what was I, what else was I going to say?

3636
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:54,440
Oh, what do you, what do you most want to see at E3, Ingo?

3637
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:57,280
Uh, Medal of Honor and Power Gig.

3638
02:56:57,280 --> 02:57:02,520
Uh, do you know any rumors about these different series and where they're going?

3639
02:57:02,520 --> 02:57:06,680
I think Medal of Honor is going to blow Modern Warfare 2 out of the water.

3640
02:57:06,680 --> 02:57:08,280
Ooh, them's fighting words.

3641
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:10,020
Why is that?

3642
02:57:10,020 --> 02:57:18,720
Because it's the, the, I don't know, because it looks awesome and the guy looks like ZZ Top.

3643
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:20,640
Well there's a good reason right there.

3644
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:21,640
Awesome.

3645
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:27,160
Well, um, you know, I hope you enjoy E3 and all the news that's coming out of it and I

3646
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:28,160
get some stuff.

3647
02:57:28,160 --> 02:57:29,740
Is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?

3648
02:57:29,740 --> 02:57:30,740
I have an announcement.

3649
02:57:30,740 --> 02:57:31,740
Yes.

3650
02:57:31,740 --> 02:57:34,080
I officially quit Infinity Ward.

3651
02:57:34,080 --> 02:57:35,080
Oh my gosh.

3652
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:36,920
Wait, did you work for Infinity Ward?

3653
02:57:36,920 --> 02:57:37,920
Yeah.

3654
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:38,920
You did?

3655
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:39,920
Yeah.

3656
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:40,920
I didn't know that.

3657
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:41,920
Wow.

3658
02:57:41,920 --> 02:57:43,920
I didn't know we had listeners of Infinity Ward listening to this show.

3659
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:44,920
Wow.

3660
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:45,920
Okay.

3661
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:49,360
Now I work for a different developer that I don't want to talk about.

3662
02:57:49,360 --> 02:57:53,280
Why did you, can we, can we ask you why you quit Infinity Ward or is it one of those like

3663
02:57:53,280 --> 02:57:55,400
it ought to be obvious, Rob?

3664
02:57:55,400 --> 02:57:56,840
Uh, kind of.

3665
02:57:56,840 --> 02:57:59,880
Appreciative contract on Activision's side.

3666
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:00,880
Ooh.

3667
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:01,880
Okay.

3668
02:58:01,880 --> 02:58:02,880
All right.

3669
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:03,880
How about that?

3670
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:04,880
I had no idea.

3671
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:05,880
Congratulations.

3672
02:58:05,880 --> 02:58:06,880
All right.

3673
02:58:06,880 --> 02:58:08,480
Well, uh, good luck to you on your new endeavors, whatever they may be.

3674
02:58:08,480 --> 02:58:09,480
Will we see you at E3?

3675
02:58:09,480 --> 02:58:10,840
Are you going to be at E3 or no?

3676
02:58:10,840 --> 02:58:11,840
Cause they don't like programmers.

3677
02:58:11,840 --> 02:58:12,840
Probably.

3678
02:58:12,840 --> 02:58:14,060
Uh, I'll be there.

3679
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:15,600
You just probably won't see me.

3680
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:17,600
Oh, Oh, well, okay then.

3681
02:58:17,600 --> 02:58:18,600
All right.

3682
02:58:18,600 --> 02:58:20,560
Well say hello if you do happen to see us.

3683
02:58:20,560 --> 02:58:21,560
All right.

3684
02:58:21,560 --> 02:58:22,560
Okay.

3685
02:58:22,560 --> 02:58:23,560
Bye.

3686
02:58:23,560 --> 02:58:24,560
Have a good E3.

3687
02:58:24,560 --> 02:58:25,560
You too.

3688
02:58:25,560 --> 02:58:26,560
All right.

3689
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:27,560
Who knew?

3690
02:58:27,560 --> 02:58:28,720
How often were we covering those Infinity Ward stories?

3691
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:31,140
We had somebody on this listening who worked on it.

3692
02:58:31,140 --> 02:58:34,220
You never know.

3693
02:58:34,220 --> 02:58:36,120
You know, I really hate to do this to you.

3694
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:40,760
I really hate to do it, but at the same time, it's E3 guys.

3695
02:58:40,760 --> 02:58:44,760
What now?

3696
02:58:44,760 --> 02:58:57,400
Apparently SingStar has a new game that is being revealed at E3.

3697
02:58:57,400 --> 02:59:04,680
It is called SingStar Dance, and it's being revealed at Sony's press conference on Tuesday

3698
02:59:04,680 --> 02:59:05,680
morning.

3699
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:10,120
It's supposedly compatible with the PS3 move controller, SingStar Dance.

3700
02:59:10,120 --> 02:59:11,960
News is leaking out about that tonight.

3701
02:59:11,960 --> 02:59:15,800
If you're going to hold the microphone and the move controllers in your hand, how's that

3702
02:59:15,800 --> 02:59:16,800
going to work?

3703
02:59:16,800 --> 02:59:17,800
I don't think you actually sing.

3704
02:59:17,800 --> 02:59:18,800
I think it's just a dance game.

3705
02:59:18,800 --> 02:59:19,800
Call it a dance.

3706
02:59:19,800 --> 02:59:22,480
I don't have a SingStar title.

3707
02:59:22,480 --> 02:59:23,640
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3708
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:24,640
Who's this?

3709
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:28,000
This is the Space Poncho List SSG100 man.

3710
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,640
Hello SSG100 Matt, our Space Poncho loving friend.

3711
02:59:30,640 --> 02:59:31,640
What's on your mind buddy?

3712
02:59:31,640 --> 02:59:32,640
Not much.

3713
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:37,800
Um, I quickly want to get you guys thoughts on, you know, I have a feeling that this E3

3714
02:59:37,800 --> 02:59:41,480
they're going to be ramming the 3D gaming down our throats.

3715
02:59:41,480 --> 02:59:42,480
Yes.

3716
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:43,920
What do you guys think?

3717
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:48,680
I think it can go suck my dick because I am not a big fan of E3 or E3.

3718
02:59:48,680 --> 02:59:49,680
Wow.

3719
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:50,680
Whoops.

3720
02:59:50,680 --> 02:59:51,680
Uh oh.

3721
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:52,800
That's going to get cut.

3722
02:59:52,800 --> 02:59:54,360
I'm a big fan of E3.

3723
02:59:54,360 --> 02:59:55,360
I love them.

3724
02:59:55,360 --> 02:59:56,360
It's 3D.

3725
02:59:56,360 --> 03:00:00,340
I am not a big fan of it because it makes me sick when it gets to that level.

3726
03:00:00,340 --> 03:00:04,240
Like watching Avatar in the theater for like two hours and all that.

3727
03:00:04,240 --> 03:00:09,760
I think all these games are just too much.

3728
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:13,600
I hate it if I have to buy a new TV and glasses for it.

3729
03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:20,160
However I will probably support the 3DS because it's all built in and I won't have a problem

3730
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:21,160
with that.

3731
03:00:21,160 --> 03:00:22,160
But I don't want to buy updates to games.

3732
03:00:22,160 --> 03:00:23,160
I don't want to buy special glasses.

3733
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:25,620
I don't want a $2,000 TV.

3734
03:00:25,620 --> 03:00:26,620
I'm extremely...

3735
03:00:26,620 --> 03:00:28,960
I do want a $2,000 TV but I don't want it for that reason.

3736
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:33,280
I'm extremely apprehensive about the 3DS but I will check it out and give it a fair shot

3737
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:34,520
and may I be wrong.

3738
03:00:34,520 --> 03:00:36,760
I will come out on the show Tuesday night.

3739
03:00:36,760 --> 03:00:37,760
You'll know.

3740
03:00:37,760 --> 03:00:41,400
I will post the little Rob Roberts and pals at E3 and if I'm wrong I will say I was wrong.

3741
03:00:41,400 --> 03:00:42,400
This thing is awesome.

3742
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:43,400
They have a Pokemon game.

3743
03:00:43,400 --> 03:00:44,400
I'm sold.

3744
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:48,040
You know if you want to blame anyone for you know this whole 3D thing you got to blame

3745
03:00:48,040 --> 03:00:53,640
the TV makers because everyone now is buying... everyone pretty much has an HDTV.

3746
03:00:53,640 --> 03:00:58,480
I don't know the exact numbers household wise but you know they need to... they want to

3747
03:00:58,480 --> 03:01:02,680
try to crank out you know new hardware, new stuff for people to buy.

3748
03:01:02,680 --> 03:01:06,360
The HDTVs and 3DTVs are completely different.

3749
03:01:06,360 --> 03:01:07,360
I mean...

3750
03:01:07,360 --> 03:01:12,000
Yeah I know but you know everyone pretty much has a 3... an HDTV now so you know they're

3751
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:16,160
trying to get people to get the new upgrade, the new tech.

3752
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:17,160
What do you think?

3753
03:01:17,160 --> 03:01:21,280
I'm turning this on you SSJ100mau, what do you think of 3D games?

3754
03:01:21,280 --> 03:01:26,480
I think it could work but I don't think that now is the proper time.

3755
03:01:26,480 --> 03:01:27,480
Now is too early.

3756
03:01:27,480 --> 03:01:28,840
This is all happening too fast.

3757
03:01:28,840 --> 03:01:32,280
The movies are one thing and then the rest is... it's too much.

3758
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:33,280
Too much.

3759
03:01:33,280 --> 03:01:36,120
You know when our economy is a little more stable, when we're... when we're able to be

3760
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:44,920
a little more frugal to go out and spend these $3,000 TVs with $150 glasses I'll look into

3761
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:45,920
it.

3762
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:49,920
But you know right now very little TV is 3D now.

3763
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:55,720
I mean I know ESPN has jumped on it, I know different sports are doing it but you know

3764
03:01:55,720 --> 03:01:57,400
it's just too early.

3765
03:01:57,400 --> 03:01:58,400
So.

3766
03:01:58,400 --> 03:02:04,200
Let me ask you this real quick, what thing at E3 are you looking forward to the most?

3767
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:08,760
I want Microsoft to give us more you know games for live.

3768
03:02:08,760 --> 03:02:11,400
You know like one versus a hundred.

3769
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:12,400
Where are those games?

3770
03:02:12,400 --> 03:02:14,080
Yeah whatever happened to that?

3771
03:02:14,080 --> 03:02:15,080
Was it just like a simple experiment?

3772
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:16,080
You know what I want to see?

3773
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:17,280
I want to see them do match game.

3774
03:02:17,280 --> 03:02:19,840
I would love match game, that would be amazing.

3775
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:20,840
Match with thousands of people.

3776
03:02:20,840 --> 03:02:27,920
What I'd like to do is just hook up a couple of Xbox 360 Slims and revive Charles Nelson

3777
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:28,920
Reilly.

3778
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:29,920
Oh my god that would be wonderful.

3779
03:02:29,920 --> 03:02:30,920
It would be great.

3780
03:02:30,920 --> 03:02:31,920
All right.

3781
03:02:31,920 --> 03:02:35,880
I just want to let you go so we can get at least one more call here on this long running

3782
03:02:35,880 --> 03:02:36,880
show tonight.

3783
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:37,880
But thanks so much for your call.

3784
03:02:37,880 --> 03:02:38,880
Yep.

3785
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:39,880
Have a good one buddy.

3786
03:02:39,880 --> 03:02:40,880
Yep.

3787
03:02:40,880 --> 03:02:42,960
All right I guess the Kinect event is over, that's what Black Wolf says.

3788
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:45,600
I don't know what happened but there you go.

3789
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:47,080
People probably just walked out.

3790
03:02:47,080 --> 03:02:49,040
I don't think they walked out.

3791
03:02:49,040 --> 03:02:50,800
Did it blow people's minds?

3792
03:02:50,800 --> 03:02:51,800
That's what I want to know.

3793
03:02:51,800 --> 03:02:55,040
Was it a mind blowing experience?

3794
03:02:55,040 --> 03:02:58,840
Were your minds blown?

3795
03:02:58,840 --> 03:02:59,840
Last call of the night.

3796
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:02,000
Hi you're on Orange Llamas Radio, who's this?

3797
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:05,880
You know I'd rather walk around and wear a space poncho throughout Manhattan than play

3798
03:03:05,880 --> 03:03:08,120
Final Fantasy VIII again.

3799
03:03:08,120 --> 03:03:09,480
Amen to that.

3800
03:03:09,480 --> 03:03:10,480
I would.

3801
03:03:10,480 --> 03:03:11,480
Boom.

3802
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:12,480
Oh my gosh.

3803
03:03:12,480 --> 03:03:13,480
I'd do both.

3804
03:03:13,480 --> 03:03:14,480
Whatever.

3805
03:03:14,480 --> 03:03:17,080
All right what is on your mind tonight Rama?

3806
03:03:17,080 --> 03:03:19,680
I'll make this quick because I know you guys are running late.

3807
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:26,560
Well a few weeks back I finally got my hands on Beatles Rock Band and guitar hero Van Halen.

3808
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:31,440
Okay, so first tell us about Beatles Rock Band.

3809
03:03:31,440 --> 03:03:38,400
I've only played a couple of tracks and honestly, my personal opinion, I would not have paid

3810
03:03:38,400 --> 03:03:39,400
$59.

3811
03:03:39,400 --> 03:03:41,800
I would have paid $39 or $49 for it.

3812
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:46,280
Luckily I got it on clearance for $9.99 at Target.

3813
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:50,480
Hmm, okay, and wait $9.99 for Beatles?

3814
03:03:50,480 --> 03:03:53,160
Yeah, select stores at the time were clearing them out.

3815
03:03:53,160 --> 03:03:55,120
I'm walking in, just checking what they had.

3816
03:03:55,120 --> 03:03:57,640
I saw Van Halen for $15 on clearance.

3817
03:03:57,640 --> 03:04:02,320
I looked over and saw Beatles for $10 so I grabbed that too.

3818
03:04:02,320 --> 03:04:04,920
Awesome.

3819
03:04:04,920 --> 03:04:09,560
Well I mean, and you like the game or it's kind of one of those, well I'm really happy

3820
03:04:09,560 --> 03:04:11,240
I didn't pay $60 for this.

3821
03:04:11,240 --> 03:04:16,360
I'm really glad I didn't pay $60 for either game because I was really hyped for guitar

3822
03:04:16,360 --> 03:04:17,360
hero Van Halen.

3823
03:04:17,360 --> 03:04:18,360
I really was.

3824
03:04:18,360 --> 03:04:23,440
So I started playing through it and I'm like, I'm not so hyped anymore.

3825
03:04:23,440 --> 03:04:28,960
And the one thing that pissed me off is that I'm halfway through the game with the drums.

3826
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:32,560
I figured, let me finish up the other half of the game on guitar.

3827
03:04:32,560 --> 03:04:40,080
No, I have to go through everything all over again with the guitar and I said, screw this.

3828
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:45,120
Alright, what about Van Halen, guitar hero?

3829
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:49,360
That's the one I was talking about.

3830
03:04:49,360 --> 03:04:53,760
I'm still hoping that one of my favorite songs is in the game, but I don't think it is, but

3831
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:55,960
I just enjoy the music.

3832
03:04:55,960 --> 03:04:58,800
That's the main reason why I got it in the first place.

3833
03:04:58,800 --> 03:05:03,320
And honestly, I think Activision really need to step their game up because we just got

3834
03:05:03,320 --> 03:05:09,600
Green Day Rock Band and well, I'm really liking that a lot more and I think that's how you

3835
03:05:09,600 --> 03:05:13,760
really need to do the expansion titles more like that instead of like having practically

3836
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:20,640
all the songs unlocked and all you're doing is unlocking like venues and so forth.

3837
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:28,800
Start out with like six or seven songs and start unlocking all the songs as you play.

3838
03:05:28,800 --> 03:05:31,360
Did you play the Green Day Rock Band by chance yet?

3839
03:05:31,360 --> 03:05:33,560
Yeah, we have it here.

3840
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:35,160
My roommate picked it up last week.

3841
03:05:35,160 --> 03:05:36,160
I'm trying to line up an interview.

3842
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:39,720
I've seen out of it, I'm trying to like line up an interview for like the last part of

3843
03:05:39,720 --> 03:05:40,720
the show here.

3844
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:42,680
So I'm like half listening and half doing this.

3845
03:05:42,680 --> 03:05:45,520
Sorry I'm the only one engaging our caller right now.

3846
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:53,080
And also before this is over, I want to throw in my two cents on this whole project $10

3847
03:05:53,080 --> 03:05:54,080
bullshit.

3848
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:55,080
Yeah, please do.

3849
03:05:55,080 --> 03:05:57,480
I think we just got his 10 cents.

3850
03:05:57,480 --> 03:05:58,640
It's bullshit.

3851
03:05:58,640 --> 03:05:59,640
I'm sorry.

3852
03:05:59,640 --> 03:06:06,120
You mean to tell me after I spent 50 bucks on live, I got to spend another $10 for on

3853
03:06:06,120 --> 03:06:07,840
line gaming?

3854
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:08,840
If you buy used.

3855
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:09,840
Used?

3856
03:06:09,840 --> 03:06:10,840
I don't care.

3857
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:17,640
And a lot of these, and remember like GameStop now is deducting $10 from the price of their

3858
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:18,640
games.

3859
03:06:18,640 --> 03:06:22,280
So in a sense, it's not really going to be any more money.

3860
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:26,560
But yeah, but then the new game buyers get screwed because now their games are worth

3861
03:06:26,560 --> 03:06:27,560
way less.

3862
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:29,920
Yes, the trade ins will be worth less.

3863
03:06:29,920 --> 03:06:30,920
Don't.

3864
03:06:30,920 --> 03:06:32,140
They pay for it either way.

3865
03:06:32,140 --> 03:06:36,480
And they're saying that this money is going to go pay for the servers and the people that

3866
03:06:36,480 --> 03:06:37,480
admin it.

3867
03:06:37,480 --> 03:06:38,480
That's bullshit.

3868
03:06:38,480 --> 03:06:39,480
No, I know.

3869
03:06:39,480 --> 03:06:42,880
That money is going to upper management to fatten their pockets because I'm on that echelon

3870
03:06:42,880 --> 03:06:46,800
of like code monkeys and tech guys.

3871
03:06:46,800 --> 03:06:50,480
We are the underappreciated folk in this world.

3872
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:55,000
Of course it was a bullshit corporate speak, but we knew that.

3873
03:06:55,000 --> 03:07:00,200
Well what are you looking forward to at E3 next week as I've been asking everybody tonight?

3874
03:07:00,200 --> 03:07:05,920
I'm actually looking forward to hearing all of what Microsoft has to say, what Nintendo

3875
03:07:05,920 --> 03:07:13,240
has to say, and I'm really curious about the supposed price cut of the $199 by Sony.

3876
03:07:13,240 --> 03:07:17,320
I'm really curious about that because I heard that twice and I'm like, that's too good to

3877
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:22,360
be true.

3878
03:07:22,360 --> 03:07:24,360
Anything else you want to say about E3?

3879
03:07:24,360 --> 03:07:26,840
No, that's pretty much it.

3880
03:07:26,840 --> 03:07:27,840
That's it.

3881
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:28,840
Alright.

3882
03:07:28,840 --> 03:07:32,920
I'm going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show here and get out and all

3883
03:07:32,920 --> 03:07:36,760
that fun stuff, but thank you so much for your call and sorry I was only like half listening.

3884
03:07:36,760 --> 03:07:38,240
There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes here.

3885
03:07:38,240 --> 03:07:39,240
My bad.

3886
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:40,240
That's okay.

3887
03:07:40,240 --> 03:07:41,240
We love you too.

3888
03:07:41,240 --> 03:07:42,240
Just wait until you come out to Brooklyn.

3889
03:07:42,240 --> 03:07:43,240
Yeah, goody goody.

3890
03:07:43,240 --> 03:07:44,240
Alright.

3891
03:07:44,240 --> 03:07:46,400
Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skyline.

3892
03:07:46,400 --> 03:07:47,400
Sorry guys.

3893
03:07:47,400 --> 03:07:50,960
We're getting hammered tonight, but so many of you didn't get through and I'm sorry, but

3894
03:07:50,960 --> 03:07:54,360
please feel free to send us some emails.

3895
03:07:54,360 --> 03:08:00,800
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to get through a little, in a different way

3896
03:08:00,800 --> 03:08:02,800
I guess you could say.

3897
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:03,800
Alright.

3898
03:08:03,800 --> 03:08:07,800
Let's go ahead and go around and kind of start to wrap up the show and get everybody's final

3899
03:08:07,800 --> 03:08:08,800
thoughts.

3900
03:08:08,800 --> 03:08:09,800
It's going to be an awesome E3.

3901
03:08:09,800 --> 03:08:10,800
I'm very excited.

3902
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:14,280
I really hope I'm not sick or I'm going to be fucking mad, but we'll bring you again

3903
03:08:14,280 --> 03:08:18,060
special shows Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday as soon as we can get them posted.

3904
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:20,800
If you don't see anything Tuesday night, don't freak out.

3905
03:08:20,800 --> 03:08:21,800
Something just went wrong.

3906
03:08:21,800 --> 03:08:22,800
We're trying to get an internet connection.

3907
03:08:22,800 --> 03:08:25,680
Or we went to play DJ Maxx.

3908
03:08:25,680 --> 03:08:26,680
Perhaps.

3909
03:08:26,680 --> 03:08:27,680
So final thoughts.

3910
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:28,680
Are we ready?

3911
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:29,680
My water's boiling.

3912
03:08:29,680 --> 03:08:30,680
Well, alright.

3913
03:08:30,680 --> 03:08:31,680
Well, bye Dark Sakura.

3914
03:08:31,680 --> 03:08:32,680
At least it's not breaking.

3915
03:08:32,680 --> 03:08:33,680
Alright.

3916
03:08:33,680 --> 03:08:36,920
Um, Loki, your final thought tonight?

3917
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:42,320
My final thought is this week will be fun to watch all the, uh, different press conferences.

3918
03:08:42,320 --> 03:08:45,920
My final thought is I'm excited to go home and take some NyQuil.

3919
03:08:45,920 --> 03:08:46,920
Yay.

3920
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:49,520
Here's one last thing I want to think about here.

3921
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:50,520
Yes.

3922
03:08:50,520 --> 03:08:51,520
Um, Ponder maybe.

3923
03:08:51,520 --> 03:08:52,520
Yes.

3924
03:08:52,520 --> 03:08:56,720
I want to face ponchos for our avatars on Xbox Live.

3925
03:08:56,720 --> 03:08:59,360
That would be amazing.

3926
03:08:59,360 --> 03:09:00,760
That would absolutely be amazing.

3927
03:09:00,760 --> 03:09:03,040
Um, Miklotov, thank you for being here.

3928
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:04,040
Thank you.

3929
03:09:04,040 --> 03:09:05,840
You came out all the way from Kansas just to be on the show, I'm sure.

3930
03:09:05,840 --> 03:09:07,480
Yeah, that was exactly my reason.

3931
03:09:07,480 --> 03:09:08,480
Exactly.

3932
03:09:08,480 --> 03:09:09,480
Sure.

3933
03:09:09,480 --> 03:09:10,480
Nothing to do with E3 or Technica.

3934
03:09:10,480 --> 03:09:11,480
Mostly Technica.

3935
03:09:11,480 --> 03:09:13,040
Uh, so, uh, do you have any final thoughts?

3936
03:09:13,040 --> 03:09:18,520
Um, my final thought is I hope that leaked floor plans for E3 are true and I get to play

3937
03:09:18,520 --> 03:09:24,320
Pokémon Black and White and see Dragon Age 2 because those are probably the games that

3938
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:25,920
will be my highlights of the show.

3939
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:26,920
Alright.

3940
03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:27,920
Well, we'll see.

3941
03:09:27,920 --> 03:09:30,960
We're just a few days away from, uh, the show floor being open.

3942
03:09:30,960 --> 03:09:31,960
It's less than 48 hours.

3943
03:09:31,960 --> 03:09:32,960
Yeah.

3944
03:09:32,960 --> 03:09:33,960
Excited.

3945
03:09:33,960 --> 03:09:34,960
Alright.

3946
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:37,960
We'll see you, uh, in a couple days with the Rob Robertson Pals special from E3 and then

3947
03:09:37,960 --> 03:09:39,840
we will all be here in studio next week.

3948
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:43,640
Loki Dark Soccer and myself, Loki Dark Soccer will be scouring up and down the internet,

3949
03:09:43,640 --> 03:09:47,720
uh, throughout the week to, uh, get us some good news to talk about, uh, and it'll be

3950
03:09:47,720 --> 03:09:50,400
a fun show, the E3 wrap up show next Sunday.

3951
03:09:50,400 --> 03:09:52,560
So we will see you next week with more of Orange Launch Radio.

3952
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:55,120
In the meantime, thank you guys for listening to our show.

3953
03:09:55,120 --> 03:09:58,840
Thank you for subscribing to our podcasts or listening live, however you're doing it.

3954
03:09:58,840 --> 03:10:03,200
Remember, if you like what you hear, all we ask, tell two people you know about the show.

3955
03:10:03,200 --> 03:10:06,960
Help us spread the word because we're not a big, uh, we can't afford a booth at E3.

3956
03:10:06,960 --> 03:10:08,060
Let's just put it that way.

3957
03:10:08,060 --> 03:10:10,200
Make sure that, uh, you help spread the word.

3958
03:10:10,200 --> 03:10:13,280
That is how, um, we get more people exposed to Orange Launch Radio.

3959
03:10:13,280 --> 03:10:16,280
Can you afford a taco stand outside E3?

3960
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:17,520
You heard the caller earlier.

3961
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:19,200
He wished he'd known about this eight years ago.

3962
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:20,520
So all you gotta do, tell your friend.

3963
03:10:20,520 --> 03:10:21,720
Alright, that's it guys.

3964
03:10:21,720 --> 03:10:22,720
Good night.

3965
03:10:22,720 --> 03:10:23,760
Have a wonderful E3.

3966
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:24,760
Happy E3!

3967
03:10:24,760 --> 03:10:25,760
Yay!
