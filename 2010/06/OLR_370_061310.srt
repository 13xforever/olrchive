1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:22,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, June 13th, 2010, the E3 News Barrage begins and we connect with our listeners to get all your feedback on the early news.

2
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:34,147
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers I'm not sick anymore

3
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:03,838
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're going to sound it on the radio, though, because you have your voice thing going on.

4
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:10,503
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is I had a viral infection and it coughed my throat, well, bloody.

5
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross.

6
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:17,248
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually not supposed to use my voice much until the 21st.

7
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:21,699
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's role in tonight's show will be scaled back just a little bit.

8
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a little.

9
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,142
[SPEAKER_14]: But she'll still be here to provide her always insightful commentary.

10
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:26,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

11
00:01:27,103 --> 00:01:28,945
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got some snark.

12
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:32,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Being sick makes a person a little extra snarky, I find.

13
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,309
[SPEAKER_14]: I am also a little sick.

14
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Just now the E3 is coming up.

15
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:42,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I have this gift, I don't know what you want to call it, where I tend to get sick at big gaming conventions.

16
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,638
[SPEAKER_14]: It happened at PAX East earlier this year and now it's happening again for E3.

17
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:46,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray.

18
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, also joining us tonight, say hello to the well and healthy, at least for now, Tech Master Loki.

19
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:54,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I am perfectly fine, except in my head.

20
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:56,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I am sick in the head.

21
00:01:56,566 --> 00:02:01,709
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's why we love you here on Orange Lounge Radio, Loki, which we're coming up on, if you can believe it, our eighth episode.

22
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to the one and only Miklatov is here tonight

23
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Video Game Company to a Video Game Store

24
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,480
[SPEAKER_14]: And for those who don't know, you used to work for... Konami.

25
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and can you say what you did at Konami, or was that a secret?

26
00:02:54,061 --> 00:03:04,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did DDR, and I made the steps, and with, you know, the other people on the team, and I did text stuff, and yeah, that's what I did there.

27
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:05,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got drunk.

28
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:09,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was fun.

29
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:09,782
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura,

30
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:22,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

31
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:22,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

32
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:23,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

33
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:24,507
[SPEAKER_14]: So what happened?

34
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you allowed to talk about what happened?

35
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:26,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

36
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:27,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Supernova.

37
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:28,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Supernova was really good.

38
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you allowed to talk about what happened?

39
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Why you no longer at Konami?

40
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:31,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

41
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:37,797
[SPEAKER_04]: They just moved and I didn't want to move because I didn't have a permanent quote unquote position.

42
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:41,860
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wasn't going to get paid to move down to where they moved their offices to.

43
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,962
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided time to leave.

44
00:03:45,723 --> 00:03:47,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you went back to where your family is, correct?

45
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:47,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

46
00:03:48,485 --> 00:03:49,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is in the Midwest.

47
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

48
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:50,467
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

49
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:51,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

50
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:52,287
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

51
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:54,128
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, but things are good for you in Kansas.

52
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:54,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Kansas treating you well?

53
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good enough.

54
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, welcome back to the show.

55
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:59,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure you haven't listened since the last time you've been on.

56
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for the past three weeks.

57
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:01,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right.

58
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:03,251
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been commenting in chat and stuff.

59
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:03,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

60
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,273
[SPEAKER_14]: The show's kind of different now than it was when you were first coming onto the show, huh?

61
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:13,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not so much about the music games anymore, but there aren't very many great music games anymore, so it's okay.

62
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:14,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

63
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:18,617
[SPEAKER_14]: For our new listeners, real quick, can you kind of define, what did Orange Lounge Radio use?

64
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:19,357
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much it.

65
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:19,637
[SPEAKER_14]: You got it.

66
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:49,409
[SPEAKER_14]: E3 is coming up and we're going to talk a lot about E3 tonight with Miklatov And speaking of which, we have big, big news coming out of the big cities tonight We're going to start off the show a little differently tonight We have an Orange Lounge Radio special report

67
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:01,711
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, we do have some big breaking news.

68
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:10,058
[SPEAKER_14]: It does appear that Scarlett Johansson has won the Tony for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play for A View from the Bridge.

69
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:13,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to Scarlett Johansson, you hot bitch.

70
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:17,245
[SPEAKER_14]: We all, okay, E3, yeah, no, there's some huge news coming out of E3.

71
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:22,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously tonight is Microsoft's big reveal of Project Natal.

72
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Not necessarily the press conference.

73
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:38,660
[SPEAKER_14]: and yes, it's not their press conference but it's their Cirque du Soleil as imagined by Cirque du Soleil or as one of my friends calls it Cirque du Sogay as the Project Natal is being reinvented or reimagined or whatever they're doing.

74
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how Patton Oswalt describes it.

75
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,242
[SPEAKER_14]: What does he describe it as?

76
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,423
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty much what it is.

77
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Dance Central Dance Central

78
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,092
[SPEAKER_14]: and USA Today is calling it a So You Think You Can Dance experience home.

79
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:35,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Although it's not for sure if the brand name actually plays into it.

80
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:36,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably not.

81
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:42,861
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want to tie in directly to last week's show, there's your Timberland Cascada game and all those things we were talking about.

82
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:44,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I say Timberland like a tree?

83
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:49,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Timberland and Cascada and all those things we were talking about last week.

84
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:50,067
[SPEAKER_14]: That's got to be it.

85
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:50,588
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

86
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:52,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Timber... Whatever.

87
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,051
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Vomitarium

[SPEAKER_14]: including a lion, a cheetah, and a tiger.

90
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,327
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like Pokecats, but with Kinect.

91
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:47,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what else to call that.

92
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:58,232
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly, and this is pretty big, Star Wars characters and Disney favorites will be featured in separate new games being developed at Microsoft in conjunction with LucasArts and Disney.

93
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:02,574
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know that whole Wii lightsaber game y'all been wanting for years and years?

94
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:03,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Guess what?

95
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft announced this

96
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what you think of the name?

97
00:08:32,855 --> 00:08:33,796
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

98
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:53,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I played with K'nex when I was a kid.

99
00:08:55,843 --> 00:08:57,385
[SPEAKER_14]: I played K'nex 4 when I was a kid.

100
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:00,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov, what do you think of K'nex?

101
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:01,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dumb.

102
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you say it's dumb?

103
00:09:02,951 --> 00:09:03,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Because.

104
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:05,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We know Natal.

105
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:09,118
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds kind of cool, futuristic, what they're kind of going for.

106
00:09:09,538 --> 00:09:09,838
[SPEAKER_04]: K'nex.

107
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:09,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

108
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.

109
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but see, remember, we all love the revolution, and, you know... And the Wii is still a stupid name.

110
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:19,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not gonna say it's not.

111
00:09:19,263 --> 00:09:20,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to the chatters.

112
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com, after all... It's just a name!

113
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:24,745
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the place where every gamer has a voice.

114
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:29,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, SJ100Matt, you know we said the same thing when they came out with the Nintendo Revolution before the Wii.

115
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:38,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that they're coming out with this wonderful system and they're totally mimicking everything that's on the Wii already.

116
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:39,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's see.

117
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:41,028
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a game that's like Wii Sports.

118
00:09:41,088 --> 00:09:43,790
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a game that's probably going to be like Wii Play.

119
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've got a game that's just like Just Dance.

120
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:53,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and we've got a game with Disney characters and Star Wars characters that will probably be very similar to what's already on the Wii, just with slightly better graphics.

121
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and we have a racing game with a fake wheel.

122
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:02,179
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really, are we going to have the same shit on this stupid console?

123
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:07,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I really going to pay the mythical $150 for this thing?

124
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:14,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Fool me once, Microsoft, I already bought your fucking camera, and it served me no purpose whatsoever.

125
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:16,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but you did get to use your picture as an icon.

126
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:18,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Or a gamer pic.

127
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:20,527
[SPEAKER_14]: And Burnout.

128
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:21,347
[SPEAKER_14]: The Burnout game.

129
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:22,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember?

130
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:23,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

131
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:32,857
[SPEAKER_14]: It took pictures of you when your car crashed, so you get pictures sent to strangers on the internet where it looks like you're taking a poop because you have these urgh faces.

132
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more chat or comments, because boy, they're being eloquent tonight.

133
00:10:38,522 --> 00:10:49,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Bochikawa in our chatroom, chat.orangehawnsradio.com, by the way, if you want to join us here live on this Sunday night, as we tape at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

134
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:54,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Bochikawa in our chatroom says, connect just won't connect to the consumer.

135
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,918
[SPEAKER_11]: This is basically their grab for the Wii Market.

136
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:07,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Problem is, people in the Wii Market have a Wii, and they're not going to buy another console to play the same fucking games.

137
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:10,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy everything.

138
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:12,667
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw in our chat, you're special.

139
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,111
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw in our chat says one of the other games will probably be Connect the Dots.

140
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,822
[SPEAKER_14]: BaconBit says the name doesn't matter as long as it's fun.

141
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:25,664
[SPEAKER_14]: And BauerCTU says I'll call it shit, not connect.

142
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:27,024
[SPEAKER_14]: How about ka-shit?

143
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:29,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we compromise here, Bauer?

144
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:30,866
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be alright, but the problem...

145
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:32,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

146
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:52,447
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

147
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:29,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see more stuff in chat I love this Salacious Pop in chat says When I hear and say Natal I think Xbox Motion Accessory But whenever I see Microsoft NATAL in print Or Microsoft Natal in print I think of ultrasounds, folic acid vitamins And diaper genies

148
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:36,191
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerCloud says watch, they will have cheesy taglines like connect to the web.

149
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:38,813
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have just called it the kinetic.

150
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:41,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because that would have been kind of neat.

151
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:45,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It would have at least sounded kind of fancy and stuff.

152
00:12:45,218 --> 00:12:51,043
[SPEAKER_11]: And I give them points, they're like one step above move, because move is just like, oh, what should we call this?

153
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it's a control you move around with.

154
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:54,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, move, good, done.

155
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,887
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't even think about a name.

156
00:12:56,187 --> 00:13:01,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Techness in our chat says they might as well have named it Connect 3D since 3D is the new marketing term and the tech that it's based on.

157
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:05,834
[SPEAKER_14]: SSJ100Matt says the real question is do they announce an Eye of Judgment game?

158
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,215
[SPEAKER_14]: If so, do we care to make a bet on it?

159
00:13:09,197 --> 00:13:10,017
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see.

160
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:12,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Lastly, where were we at?

161
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:15,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, SSJ100Matt says Connect starring Jodie Foster.

162
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Spoiler alert, it's her father.

163
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,379
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:50,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go ahead and actually get into a little bit of the normal flow of our show, but we thought we'd interrupt there for the breaking Xbox news.

165
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,855
[SPEAKER_14]: We will keep you posted if anything else breaks during the conference.

166
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if we think of any other funny connect jokes.

167
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:59,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Special events featuring Cirque de French Gay.

168
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:01,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Star Trek Online, I Hit Commander, Finally

169
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:31,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, um, I made a friend in Scotland.

170
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:31,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you?

171
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:32,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

172
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,056
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's not Scottish, it's crap.

173
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:35,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.

174
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:43,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, I, uh, I've been playing Sims 3 like I'm doing right now.

175
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,745
[SPEAKER_02]: During the show.

176
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:46,246
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slow.

177
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:46,906
[SPEAKER_02]: During the show.

178
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:47,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what else is new?

179
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:49,328
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's, I know, I know.

180
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you not playing Star Trek Online during the show and eating bandwidth.

181
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:52,550
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

182
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned off Steam for the show, Rob.

183
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:55,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very happy you did that.

184
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I was enamored with watching everyone's Steam updates.

185
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I played some Portal.

186
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:03,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially since I got it free.

187
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:05,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Free is good.

188
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:07,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Free is very good.

189
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:09,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Alrighty.

190
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move on to Loki.

191
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,021
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your gaming week, Loki?

192
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Same old stuff again.

193
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:16,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Grand Theft Auto.

194
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:17,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Mainly

195
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:27,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been playing just the regular deathmatch stuff, but we have been having some really serious connection problems thanks to our wonderful bandwidth at work.

196
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Red Dead Redemption, more co-op than that.

197
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:32,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm like level 20-something now, like 23.

198
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:43,338
[SPEAKER_11]: And Earth Defense Force, we're most of the way through the Inferno difficulty, and it's major fun.

199
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,220
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

200
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,500
[SPEAKER_11]: That's...

201
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:49,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much it.

202
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:59,450
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been mainly painting baby room and working on Grand Theft Auto 4 editing.

203
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,312
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Imagine Babies in real life, basically.

204
00:16:02,984 --> 00:16:04,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's game related.

205
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:05,946
[SPEAKER_11]: The room is New Super Mario.

206
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:09,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, and I don't know if the pictures are public or whatever, but they're really cute.

207
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:12,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a lot of the stuff that you and the wife are doing are really cute.

208
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:22,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we got big old stuffed animals of Koopas and, you know, the star and the fire flower and stuff like that.

209
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:30,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, we have wall decals for the New Super Mario Brothers characters and the bricks and question blocks and all that fun stuff.

210
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,918
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

211
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:04,712
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was the best one though and it made me sad and I hate the people at Roseville Golf Line because they're idiots.

212
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:06,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they listen and know that they're dumb.

213
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:13,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved it too because when Miklatov was kind of getting off the plane and he met Alan, we went out to lunch when he first got here.

214
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:17,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Because what's the first thing anyone wants to do when they come to California?

215
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:18,796
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, let's go eat.

216
00:17:19,036 --> 00:17:20,277
[SPEAKER_14]: And Miklatov wanted to go too?

217
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,037
[SPEAKER_04]: In-N-Out.

218
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:21,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

219
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:27,623
[SPEAKER_14]: So we went to In-N-Out and we were eating and Miklatov was like, I didn't come here for E3.

220
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:29,104
[SPEAKER_14]: I came here to play DJ Max Technica.

221
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:29,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

222
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:34,869
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we went to Roseville Golf Line last night and I looked and the machine was broken, I couldn't help but laugh.

223
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really funny.

224
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really depressing moment in my life.

225
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:44,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sad, but... And then the people would not sell me Technica cards, which they had.

226
00:17:44,478 --> 00:17:46,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go up there three times to get them.

227
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, the guy just said, okay.

228
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:51,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, you know, these don't work because the machine doesn't work.

229
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:55,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I understand that, but I'm giving you money to give me these cards.

230
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:57,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did.

231
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate 16-year-olds that work at arcades.

232
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:04,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Arcade Infinity is still open and couldn't you guys go there?

233
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:06,456
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a backup plan.

234
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:07,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and yes.

235
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:12,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to call them and be like so do you have a working Technica machine?

236
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Because other places don't.

237
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:15,381
[SPEAKER_04]: You should.

238
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:18,023
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was also an idea we could go to Sunnyvale Golf Land.

239
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:19,664
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't think we can make it work with the timing.

240
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:21,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have a family thing Saturday I have to go to.

241
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:27,733
[SPEAKER_04]: and Sunnyville has Sirius too which would be fun to play but maybe Arcade Infinity might as well since they used to be up on that stuff.

242
00:18:28,053 --> 00:18:28,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

243
00:18:28,593 --> 00:18:29,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

244
00:18:30,034 --> 00:18:30,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

245
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Aren't they like almost closing now or something?

246
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:34,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Aren't they like one of those save the arcades?

247
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:36,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

248
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:36,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Sadly.

249
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Sherzo in chat says Rob, I was there when he was there Friday night.

250
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov was at RVGL.

251
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:42,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I met him.

252
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:46,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Well that's amazing because he was still in Kansas Friday night.

253
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,867
[SPEAKER_14]: We both went on Saturday actually.

254
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:49,827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cool.

255
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:52,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was me from the future but in the past.

256
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless he's getting his days mixed up.

257
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:58,134
[SPEAKER_14]: He could have been that guy because there was a guy playing Beatmania 2DX who was pretty good.

258
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Miklasov too.

259
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:01,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

260
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,680
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a first in a couple years.

261
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else you played this week you want to mention?

262
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:29,294
[SPEAKER_04]: um oh on the plane I was playing DJ Max because it's like the only game I play anymore and this old lady was sitting like two seats next to me away from me because we had an empty seat in the middle she kept watching me play it and it was really creepy because she was like really old like 60 or 70 and then she's talked to me I was like whatever I just want to play my game

263
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:34,390
[SPEAKER_04]: But she enjoyed DJ Max kind of over your shoulder?

264
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Or being a creepy stalkery, I don't know.

265
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:38,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Old lady?

266
00:19:38,472 --> 00:19:39,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I said.

267
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:40,373
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there you go.

268
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:41,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Creepy.

269
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have your first encounter with a cougar?

270
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:46,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Come here, little boy.

271
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some candy.

272
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:48,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that is gross.

273
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:50,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, my gaming week.

274
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Not quite as interesting as anyone else's.

275
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:58,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I did go to Golfland with Miglatov last night and point laughed when the machine was down.

276
00:19:58,776 --> 00:19:59,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Although not really.

277
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:00,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually thought that was kind of crap.

278
00:20:00,697 --> 00:20:01,478
[SPEAKER_14]: You did laugh though.

279
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:05,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I did laugh, but it was one of those like, that fucking sucks laugh.

280
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:06,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know.

281
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:10,424
[SPEAKER_14]: But I played Beatmania, what is it they have there?

282
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:11,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Distorted.

283
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:12,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that 13, 14?

284
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:13,386
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 13.

285
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:13,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

286
00:20:14,206 --> 00:20:15,367
[SPEAKER_14]: When the music stopped getting good.

287
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:16,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Some teen.

288
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:17,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, some teen.

289
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:19,850
[SPEAKER_14]: But I played a bunch of old songs.

290
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I can surprisingly still pass level 7 and 8 songs.

291
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:24,593
[SPEAKER_14]: I beat Daisuke, I was all like, woo!

292
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,121
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened to you playing Final Fantasy XIII?

293
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,335
[SPEAKER_14]: DoctorStrangePork

294
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:13,945
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a mouse with a long tongue.

295
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:46,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright And that was pretty much my gaming week Not a lot of exciting stuff outside of that But BlackWolf in chat says Oink is awesome, you all stop making fun of Oink right now I love Oink It's Miklatov that is the hater

296
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:48,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Haters to the left

297
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:07,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Housekeeping First

298
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,259
[SPEAKER_14]: E3 Overload

299
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:02,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob Roberts and pals will bring you some specials to the feed.

300
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:05,081
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, Miklatov, one of my pals, will be there every night.

301
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:10,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hoping that Bobby Blackwolf and whatever other pals I find in LA will also be there.

302
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,966
[SPEAKER_14]: So there'll be lots of feed updates this week.

303
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:19,211
[SPEAKER_14]: So make sure you are subscribed to our feed in iTunes or whatever your favorite little podcatcher program is so you don't miss anything.

304
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,553
[SPEAKER_14]: This is also very important during housekeeping.

305
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:30,622
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a bad feeling this is going to get forgotten a little bit amongst all the E3 hype that's going on right now, but I do want to mention we talked about this a little bit last week, but it is official.

306
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:35,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio and our listenership will be participating in the All Games Big Battle.

307
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,008
[SPEAKER_14]: BigBattle.com

308
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:55,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I know one of them was Pinball.

309
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the recently announced ones.

310
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:09,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Those were just announced a little earlier this week where you can actually play either Zen Pinball on the PS3 or the Pinball FX on the 360.

311
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:12,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Those games will be a part of this.

312
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Soldner X2, there's competition for that.

313
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:20,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is going to be a live competition on June 26th, Battlefield Bad Company 2.

314
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:21,379
[SPEAKER_14]: All that information is at...

315
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:30,565
[SPEAKER_14]: BigBattle.AllGames.com We will bring you a little more information on that this next week after E3 settles down a little bit.

316
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:35,188
[SPEAKER_14]: The first competition I believe ends is the Soldner X21 and it ends on the 26th.

317
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:36,068
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a little time.

318
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:39,090
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you want to get the jump on these competitions, go check it out.

319
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially the pinball ones.

320
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:42,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have some listeners that are good at pinball.

321
00:24:42,373 --> 00:24:48,997
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no reason that Orange Lounge Radio should not destroy all of the other shows participating in at least pinball.

322
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:50,118
[SPEAKER_14]: And pinball is two.

323
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:50,538
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two.

324
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:51,959
[SPEAKER_14]: There's pinball FX and pinball.

325
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,804
[SPEAKER_14]: So we should have at least half these competitions right out the gate.

326
00:24:54,824 --> 00:24:57,049
[SPEAKER_11]: They got me excited there because I was reading this all of a sudden.

327
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,694
[SPEAKER_11]: It said, for PS3s and pinballs, Earth Defense Force.

328
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:01,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, ooh, Earth Defense Force!

329
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:02,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I will win at that!

330
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,481
[SPEAKER_11]: But no.

331
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:05,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, it's not.

332
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:09,305
[SPEAKER_14]: I am trying to get Derek to put Grand Theft Auto 4 as one of the games.

333
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:10,587
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll see.

334
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:11,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be kind of tough.

335
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:14,330
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has to be Episodes of Liberty City because that's a better game.

336
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,471
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see, we'll see.

337
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we'll talk more about that next week.

338
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:24,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to belittle the importance of the event, but just with E3 going on, I just think everybody's going to forget.

339
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:30,303
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to get kind of lost amongst all the E3 madness, but we will be kind of giving you regular updates on what's going on there.

340
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:35,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting next week So again, sign up now, get the jump on everything Read all about it, bigbattle.allgames.com

341
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:40,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see what else is going on right now that I want to tell you guys about.

342
00:25:40,555 --> 00:25:43,857
[SPEAKER_14]: The anniversary show for Orange Lounge Radio is coming up in two weeks.

343
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:45,697
[SPEAKER_14]: So next Sunday we will be live.

344
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:46,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It's our post E3 show.

345
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:54,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we will be here for the anniversary show of Orange Lounge Radio which will be on the 14 days from tonight.

346
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,021
[SPEAKER_14]: So the 27th.

347
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,322
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after that is July 4th.

348
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:01,323
[SPEAKER_14]: We will not be live on July 4th due to the holiday.

349
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:04,845
[SPEAKER_14]: People want to go set things on fire instead of sitting here on the radio.

350
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:06,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget Geek Life

351
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:35,428
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura is going to start us off tonight with some gaming news.

352
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,149
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, DarkSakura?

353
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Guitar Hero.

354
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Rock Band 3.

355
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:03,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The keytar is official for Rock Band 3.

356
00:27:04,212 --> 00:27:09,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be either something you can play as a horizontal keyboard or over the shoulder.

357
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:13,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this little handle, very keytar-like.

358
00:27:14,694 --> 00:27:17,135
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a two-octave keyboard.

359
00:27:17,175 --> 00:27:19,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very Keyboard Mania-like.

360
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:20,116
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 keys, I think.

361
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:21,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, two-octave.

362
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:23,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, it's not a keytar.

363
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:24,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, yay, yay.

364
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you could stand it upright and it could be a guitar, but it's an actual bona fide keyboard.

365
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I love you, Harmonix.

366
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:35,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's that and the hyper guitar.

367
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:37,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that thing?

368
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:39,045
[SPEAKER_02]: The hyper guitar.

369
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that like the 120 button one?

370
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:42,627
[SPEAKER_14]: The 120 fret with strings.

371
00:27:42,867 --> 00:27:44,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now they want to teach you how to really play.

372
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:47,111
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of want it.

373
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:47,692
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

374
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:51,893
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't care about any of it because keyboards and Bohemian Rhapsody.

375
00:27:51,953 --> 00:28:00,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And the cool thing is if you play in pro mode and you play the expert level and if you can memorize what you're doing, you will be able to play the actual real song.

376
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:02,077
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the great thing about this.

377
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:03,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

378
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:11,621
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that I thought was a little weird was when you look at the video, the pro mode note chart kind of scrolls to the right and to the left.

379
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:13,261
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't see it all on the screen at once.

380
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:14,682
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's actually kind of cool.

381
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:17,823
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's supposed to tell you when to move your hands around.

382
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:21,965
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's what the point is, but I'm a little apprehensive about it.

383
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:27,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's limited screen space, basically, because you can't have 25 rows on there at one time.

384
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,274
[SPEAKER_11]: So what they do is, as the song shifts octaves or whatever, it will scroll over.

385
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:36,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is fine by me, it looks pretty awesome.

386
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:40,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering how they'd be able to pull it off, and it looks like you can do it.

387
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what I want to see is how the hell they're going to do the guitar part of the pro mode, because that's going to be weird.

388
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:51,068
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Tiger Claw is in our chat right now and he said the same thing.

389
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:55,051
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just thinking, Sky, it's an actual keyboard you can plug into your computer and use as a MIDI keyboard.

390
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:58,113
[SPEAKER_14]: That just makes it like 10 times more awesome.

391
00:28:58,313 --> 00:28:59,054
[SPEAKER_14]: More awesomer.

392
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:08,960
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can actually get a MIDI adapter to plug into any MIDI guitars, drums, or keyboards that you may have as well and use those in Rock Band.

393
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,463
[SPEAKER_14]: So what do you guys think of Rock Band 3 so far from this news we're hearing?

394
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:29,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Guitar Hero I am so excited Bohemian Rhapsody and Power of Love There were some other songs they announced too I don't have the whole list in front of me but it looks like it's going to be a pretty solid list lots of newer stuff but some of the old stuff too for fun

395
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:31,987
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're going to get to our next news story.

396
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:34,629
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, guys, I can't control tonight.

397
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,410
[SPEAKER_14]: There is just so much breaking news.

398
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,220
[SPEAKER_14]: The Tony for best mute.

399
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,680
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

400
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, we're going to go to Miklatov with a special report.

401
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:56,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently those rumors about a new 360 appear true.

402
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:13,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they are redesigning the 360, and it will come with a 250 gigabyte hard drive, but most importantly, built-in Wi-Fi, so you don't have to pay $100 to be able to connect to the internet if you don't have a very long ethernet cable.

403
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:16,555
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes with a fork and a knife and a clock and a pillow.

404
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:19,412
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be great, actually.

405
00:30:19,832 --> 00:30:20,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you could sleep on your 360.

406
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:22,894
[SPEAKER_14]: No name for this yet, though, right?

407
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:23,174
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

408
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:24,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Foreign ads?

409
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:26,496
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all leaking from foreign?

410
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,117
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Italian, it looks like.

411
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:31,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we trust the Italians?

412
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:31,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

413
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,601
[SPEAKER_04]: They're dirty.

414
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks really cool.

415
00:30:36,822 --> 00:30:39,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very sleek, not so much slim.

416
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:43,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like it could poke your eye out because it's also very pointy.

417
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:46,930
[SPEAKER_11]: They also changed, of course, since it is going to be slimmer.

418
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:54,593
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very similar to what they were showing in those leaked motherboard development unit pictures.

419
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:59,916
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically now going to be all integrated into one chip instead of having a separate GPU, CPU.

420
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:07,041
[SPEAKER_11]: and they're going to have the ventilation on it cooling straight out above the chip instead of going through this duct work that they had in there.

421
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:08,562
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was kind of neat.

422
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:12,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I do want to tell you guys, I guarantee you it is not called the 360 Slim.

423
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:16,609
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only being called that because we're used to this kind of redesign thing from Sony's end.

424
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:18,030
[SPEAKER_14]: They call it the Slim.

425
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft will call this something else, which we'll hear tomorrow.

426
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:22,653
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 Cinched.

427
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:23,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

428
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:24,575
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it looks like.

429
00:31:24,915 --> 00:31:27,317
[SPEAKER_14]: The 360 Slightly Smaller or the 180.

430
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:27,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Connect.

431
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not even get a new name, though.

432
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,123
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can come out with a new system design and still call it the same thing.

433
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:36,863
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

434
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:38,464
[SPEAKER_14]: They might just call it the Xbox 360.

435
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:44,088
[SPEAKER_04]: When they redesigned the old, old Nintendo to be top-loading or whatever, it didn't have a different name.

436
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:44,508
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

437
00:31:44,928 --> 00:31:53,754
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've already heard about the fact that Microsoft kind of wants to reboot the system and include Natal, excuse me, Kinect as a part of the new system.

438
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:54,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

439
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:55,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Guarantee it.

440
00:31:55,535 --> 00:32:04,962
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be bundles on the shelves this Christmas with the pointy 360 with Wi-Fi and Kinect all in one box with Kinect Sports or Kinect Kitties or whatever that game was.

441
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:10,686
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those BS games all together for the low, low price of $250 we'll say.

442
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope.

443
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:12,948
[SPEAKER_11]: $300 I bet you.

444
00:32:13,328 --> 00:32:15,010
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds more realistic.

445
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps.

446
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:21,935
[SPEAKER_14]: But they'll also sell Netflix and whatever else they're going to announce tomorrow whether it be Hulu or anything else.

447
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:22,916
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

448
00:32:23,717 --> 00:32:24,478
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

449
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:41,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Tornadoes don't blare.

450
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,530
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the sirens that blare.

451
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Tornadoes spin.

452
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:43,992
[SPEAKER_14]: The tornado is coming.

453
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:48,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so if the tornado doesn't knock out your connection, you might have to call us once in a while with your breaking news.

454
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:49,515
[SPEAKER_04]: With my breaking news?

455
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:49,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

456
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:54,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be like, I just played a retro game on Xbox Live Game Room.

457
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:55,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It was stupid.

458
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Breaking news.

459
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:57,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

460
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:01,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, let's fast forward to next week.

461
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:04,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov will call in live to the show and it'll go something like this.

462
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:20,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it looks like that Miklatov is calling into the show.

463
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:22,353
[SPEAKER_14]: He's calling in with some breaking news.

464
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:27,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go live to Miklatov and see what is going on in gaming news.

465
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:27,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov.

466
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:28,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

467
00:33:30,455 --> 00:33:31,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

468
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:33,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

469
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Signal in toilet.

470
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:41,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, apparently there's been a takeover of our feed from Understation Live.

471
00:33:41,696 --> 00:33:45,317
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what that is all about, but that just wasn't funny.

472
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,198
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's move on.

473
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, do you have some gaming news for us?

474
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:54,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's regarding rumors about the 3DS.

475
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:03,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently there's reports out saying that the system is more powerful than the Wii, and unlike what was previously thought, it will not be using the new NVIDIA chips.

476
00:34:04,263 --> 00:34:15,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, apparently both IGN and Eurogamer have been reporting that, uh, developers have said off the record, which is funny because they're reporting on it, so if it was off the record, wouldn't it be not reported on it?

477
00:34:15,448 --> 00:34:16,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that would be on the record?

478
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:17,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

479
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:21,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, that the handheld won't use the Nvidia Tegra chip.

480
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:35,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, YourGamer is saying that the 3DS hardware is internally known as CTR, suggesting that the motherboard image submitted to the FCC in May, which noted CTR as a codename, was indeed the 3DS.

481
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:43,481
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that's kind of interesting, Kotaku I know posted a mock-up of what they thought the 3DS would look like based off of what they saw on the website.

482
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:51,603
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny that they didn't really pick up on the analog nub that was on there since it looks exactly like the analog nub on the PSP.

483
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:54,844
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, it will have an analog nub on there.

484
00:34:54,884 --> 00:35:00,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, the top screen is going to be widescreen, bottom screen not widescreen.

485
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:07,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, they're going to have some sort of toggle on there to adjust how much 3D is on there, I guess.

486
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:11,068
[SPEAKER_11]: You can adjust, I guess, the depth field or whatever.

487
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:29,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And according to IGN also, they're saying that several developers have experienced 3DS in its current form and have reported off the record that its processing capabilities far exceed the Nintendo Wii and bring the device up with abilities that are close to the HD consoles such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

488
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:39,644
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's the case, thank God, Nintendo, you finally did something right and actually put out a console that has better tech than what's already out there.

489
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of saying, well, it's not going to be about technology, it's going to be about the gameplay.

490
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:44,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Because guess what?

491
00:35:44,647 --> 00:35:45,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the gameplay is all the same.

492
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,809
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's got to be about the tech now.

493
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:56,933
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be kind of weird to see what the Wii is going to do with all these new motion controllers and stuff like that now that they're kind of on an even playing field.

494
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:06,548
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of intrigues me that a handheld system could possibly be as powerful as some of the stuff that's in our living room.

495
00:36:06,568 --> 00:36:07,349
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it makes sense.

496
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:16,433
[SPEAKER_14]: The technology, I mean, this cycle of video games really has lasted longer than I think a lot of people have expected it to.

497
00:36:16,493 --> 00:36:19,994
[SPEAKER_14]: And you remember they came out and said, PlayStation 3 is going to have a 10-year life cycle.

498
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:21,675
[SPEAKER_14]: 360 is going to have these long life cycles.

499
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:26,557
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems to really be happening because usually we should be hearing about new consoles this year at E3.

500
00:36:26,837 --> 00:36:27,698
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's not going to happen.

501
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:31,759
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if you want to blame the economy or the investment on these or what.

502
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really know.

503
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:36,720
[SPEAKER_14]: But the point is, you know, these consoles are still there.

504
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And the technology is a little bit old.

505
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,421
[SPEAKER_14]: It's interesting to me, though, that now the handhelds have already caught up.

506
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:44,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think a lot of us also kind of think, oh, well, Nintendo.

507
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:48,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, the Advance was basically a Super Nintendo.

508
00:36:49,203 --> 00:36:51,143
[SPEAKER_14]: The DS was basically a Nintendo 64.

509
00:36:51,423 --> 00:36:53,544
[SPEAKER_14]: So logically, the next system is basically a...

510
00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:55,065
[SPEAKER_05]: GameCube.

511
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:58,289
[SPEAKER_14]: And then again, the Wii is also kind of basically a GameCube, isn't it?

512
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn, WiiCube.

513
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:03,134
[SPEAKER_14]: And they also usually do improve it like a little bit, right?

514
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:03,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I crazy?

515
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:08,451
[SPEAKER_14]: They kind of, like, you know, it would be improved, like, a little bit.

516
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:12,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, the DS felt like a little more than just a Nintendo 64, is it just me?

517
00:37:13,295 --> 00:37:19,320
[SPEAKER_11]: But they need a new gimmick because, I mean, if you want to play touchscreen games now, I mean, you have the iPhone, you have the iPad.

518
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:29,128
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's not really any more... I mean, they're not the unique game system out there anymore.

519
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:33,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, with, you know, this new system, now that they have 3D...

520
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:43,176
[SPEAKER_11]: No other system is doing that right now unless PlayStation announces a new PSP which will be 3D as well because I'm sure they will try to do something like that.

521
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll be digital downloads only because it's an experiment.

522
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,591
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get to that in a little bit.

523
00:37:48,951 --> 00:37:50,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do some comments from our chat room.

524
00:37:50,313 --> 00:37:55,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat.OrangeLionTradio.com Jay Dizzle wants you all to know he's connecting on the toilet right now.

525
00:37:56,297 --> 00:38:04,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Tiger Claw says, you know, don't be surprised if Sony announces the PSP2 with 3D support if you buy the 3D add-on glasses, which will probably be their way to counter the 3DS.

526
00:38:05,184 --> 00:38:05,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

527
00:38:06,305 --> 00:38:08,447
[SPEAKER_14]: SSJ100Matt says, so this is a confirmed rumor?

528
00:38:08,507 --> 00:38:10,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop talking to us in riddles and oxymorons, dammit.

529
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:18,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Bochikawa says, this might be a good move for Nintendo, putting their cards in the mobile market and selling the Wii or predecessors to soccer moms and six-year-olds.

530
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:21,295
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually really not a bad strategy.

531
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,137
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been working for them so far.

532
00:38:23,557 --> 00:38:23,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

533
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my problem.

534
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,481
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're gonna hate this, but...

535
00:38:29,758 --> 00:38:34,861
[SPEAKER_11]: My problem with Nintendo is I don't think they know how to deal with new hardware as far as advanced stuff.

536
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:38,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you notice, what were some of the games that we got when the Wii came out?

537
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:40,403
[SPEAKER_11]: GameCube ports.

538
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:44,306
[SPEAKER_11]: What are some of the games that we got on the Nintendo DS?

539
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:48,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically ports of stuff that was on Nintendo 64 and that kind of stuff.

540
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:52,650
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I was about to jump in there and say, but OMG, the Zelda game, it was amazing.

541
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, oh yeah, there was a GameCube version of that.

542
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:57,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, it was a GameCube port.

543
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:05,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Granted, they're going to have this wonderful new shiny hardware and they're going to be able to do really amazing stuff, but it won't come right away.

544
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:11,506
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be, oh look, we were working on this game for the DS, but now that we have the 3DS, let's just port it over and it'll be in 3D.

545
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,128
[SPEAKER_11]: But the graphics will be really simple.

546
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:38,472
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a crazy thought really crazy super crazy thought you guys here's my crazy thought we know that there's a new Zelda game that's supposed to be coming at E3 this year right and that it's supposed to be like a better looking type of game it's going to be you know kind of specially designed and it's going to be uber and all that stuff what if the Zelda game is actually a 3DS game well I'm sure they will have a 3DS Zelda game but I think it's actually going to be on the Wii hmm

547
00:39:39,294 --> 00:40:00,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm most worried about the screen size now the rumored screen size to be the size of the DSi screens because I picked up an XL because I'm a Nintendo whore at least in the handheld sense and I can't go back I mean that screen really does not lose that much resolution in my opinion and it'd be really nice to have another system with screens that big

548
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:05,496
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to point out too, Miklatov is actually in studio right now wearing a 1-Up beanie, so he's not lying.

549
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:08,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not talking about that website, I'm talking about the actual 1-Up mushroom.

550
00:40:09,398 --> 00:40:09,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

551
00:40:09,718 --> 00:40:10,078
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

552
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:11,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Very nice.

553
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:17,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of rumored games that are coming out for the 3DS, Destructoid has ran a story.

554
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:22,982
[SPEAKER_14]: According to their sources, they strongly believe that Nintendo has been getting the developers and publishers over with the 3DS.

555
00:40:24,002 --> 00:40:29,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Demo of Animal Crossing apparently is an internal demo that they're showing off to developers to try and get people over.

556
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:35,652
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the game that's supposed to be revealed this next week as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS.

557
00:40:36,092 --> 00:40:42,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendo went back into a corner and said comment on this, dammit, has said Nintendo does not comment on rumors or speculation.

558
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:46,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen Nintendo, if you're putting out another Animal Crossing game, I'm not fucking buying it.

559
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:47,182
[SPEAKER_11]: You know why?

560
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:51,845
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because the last two games you've put out have been exactly the same as the first one except with less features.

561
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,941
[SPEAKER_11]: So go fuck yourself with your fucking Animal Crossing because I am... What if... Hold on.

562
00:40:57,241 --> 00:40:57,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Anger.

563
00:40:57,741 --> 00:40:58,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Angry man.

564
00:40:58,481 --> 00:40:59,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Angry man sitting over there in the chair.

565
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:00,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

566
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:04,644
[SPEAKER_14]: What if they've actually made changes?

567
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:06,364
[SPEAKER_14]: They won't.

568
00:41:06,404 --> 00:41:07,685
[SPEAKER_11]: They've actually made changes.

569
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:11,106
[SPEAKER_11]: What if... What if... Stay with me here.

570
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell had ice in it.

571
00:41:16,481 --> 00:41:20,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you would put it kindly, froze over.

572
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, if you read the Inferno, the core of hell is icy.

573
00:41:26,642 --> 00:41:32,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but the hell that Nintendo is familiar with does not have ice in it.

574
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:34,004
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm sorry.

575
00:41:35,224 --> 00:41:38,125
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I can see them doing is adding 3D to it.

576
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really going to be the same fucking game all over again.

577
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:43,095
[SPEAKER_04]: They might add a new fruit.

578
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:44,255
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

579
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,316
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make people buy it.

580
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:58,218
[SPEAKER_14]: And they might take out your villagers and put them in the city now because, you know, that's... Wait, what if, what if, what if, stay with me here, what if, what if they gave the animals machine guns?

581
00:41:59,178 --> 00:41:59,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Never forget.

582
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,039
[SPEAKER_11]: They will never give them machine guns.

583
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:04,439
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll give them squirt guns.

584
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Paintball.

585
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:11,740
[SPEAKER_11]: That paintball would be cool.

586
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Question, question, question, question, question.

587
00:42:15,062 --> 00:42:19,064
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the best part about Animal Crossing when you would play it for the first time?

588
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:25,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitting the people with the net Terrorizing the animals in your village, correct?

589
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:39,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Digging holes around them so they couldn't move Exactly What if Nintendo made a game that was nothing but terrorizing your villagers in Animal Crossing So they're going to bring the Sims to the DS?

590
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:39,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the 3DS?

591
00:42:42,575 --> 00:42:45,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I realize, you know what DarkSakura used to do?

592
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:47,417
[SPEAKER_14]: She would make gay pride flags and put them outside of people's houses.

593
00:42:47,457 --> 00:42:51,159
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because I had a lesbian in my town.

594
00:42:51,379 --> 00:42:54,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the chick that had the P.E.

595
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,660
[SPEAKER_02]: room.

596
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:56,381
[SPEAKER_02]: What was she, a duck?

597
00:42:57,265 --> 00:42:58,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

598
00:42:58,665 --> 00:42:59,906
[SPEAKER_04]: They just replaced like a letter.

599
00:43:00,126 --> 00:43:12,830
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was wearing sweats and had PE equipment and she would ask questions that could be taken the wrong way so we put a big rainbow sign outside of her house.

600
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,651
[SPEAKER_02]: She was our town lesbian and then she moved to Rob's town.

601
00:43:15,671 --> 00:43:16,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

602
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:17,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, hold on, this is great.

603
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:21,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me a gold star stat, because a chatter just won a gold star here.

604
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:23,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Get me a gold star stat for this comment.

605
00:43:24,281 --> 00:43:28,046
[SPEAKER_14]: BauerCTU says, animal double crossing.

606
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:29,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it.

607
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:29,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Love it!

608
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:31,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Reggie, you listening?

609
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:33,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

610
00:43:52,842 --> 00:44:19,135
[SPEAKER_11]: so I mean come on it's not going to steal away sales from the Wii it's just going to be really kick ass and you know what you can do you can sell your wonderful virtual console games as downloadable content for Animal Crossing there's a thought but it would be a creative thought and embracing digital content and online something Nintendo does not do it's the scariest thing in the world to them

611
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:23,121
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be an interesting E3.

612
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,904
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody's kind of punchy in studio tonight.

613
00:44:24,944 --> 00:44:25,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of like this.

614
00:44:25,685 --> 00:44:26,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

615
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:28,830
[SPEAKER_14]: God, just think about the show.

616
00:44:31,934 --> 00:44:32,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more news.

617
00:44:33,694 --> 00:44:35,675
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm done with this 3DS thing until I get to see it.

618
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:47,397
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say, the plan right now, in quotes, unless something super awesome is revealed in the next couple days that we decide we have to see on the show floor, Miklatov and I plan to go run and see the 3DS first.

619
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:47,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't run.

620
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:49,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I might walk a little fast.

621
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:51,378
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll walk in accelerated pace.

622
00:44:51,718 --> 00:44:52,319
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kind of old.

623
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:56,860
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll walk with a cane in an accelerated pace towards the 3DS line.

624
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:22,203
[SPEAKER_14]: uh over at Nintendo because the thought is everybody's still going to be at Sony's press conference so we want to do the 3DS thing first so we're hoping that'll be on the first show Tuesday night Rob Roberts and pals all right uh Loki let's do something besides the 3DS what you got for us um well let's see the PSP Go apparently was an experiment according to Sony they're claiming that um

625
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,682
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

626
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:50,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... That sounds like a poor excuse for the reason why your console failed.

627
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:59,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Not because your console was, I don't know, $80 more than, say, the same console that had media already.

628
00:45:59,684 --> 00:46:08,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically had all the same features, except the ability to actually, you know, buy disc-based games and be able to sell those games back when you're done with them.

629
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:09,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

630
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:15,610
[SPEAKER_11]: If you really wanted to know where your consumer behavior was, put out a fucking survey.

631
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:17,892
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need to create a new console.

632
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:22,815
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a failure, and that's what it was.

633
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:24,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Do not call it an experiment.

634
00:46:24,216 --> 00:46:25,297
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a failure.

635
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:33,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, it's just kind of one of those like, boy, they ran away with their tail between its legs.

636
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:34,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, is this it?

637
00:46:34,498 --> 00:46:42,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this kind of like an official confirmation, you think, of the fact that it's a done deal and the PSP Go is no longer going to be sold?

638
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:43,187
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what's the deal?

639
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:44,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

640
00:46:44,128 --> 00:46:45,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you heard anything about this getting pulled from shelves?

641
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:47,632
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't heard anything, but let me put it this way.

642
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:50,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they haven't really been selling like hotcakes, I mean, at all.

643
00:46:51,216 --> 00:46:52,057
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you expect?

644
00:46:52,097 --> 00:47:00,442
[SPEAKER_11]: You're putting out a console to your retailers and you're saying, oh, by the way, your customers aren't going to be able to buy any sort of software for this from you.

645
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:03,443
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can sell our console for us.

646
00:47:03,563 --> 00:47:07,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, by the way, you're not going to make any money off those consoles because consoles have no markup whatsoever.

647
00:47:07,986 --> 00:47:14,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, go ahead and sell this for no sort of profit whatsoever and then you're not going to profit for it later on.

648
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,112
[SPEAKER_11]: Most consumers or retailers out there are going to go,

649
00:47:19,112 --> 00:47:23,856
[SPEAKER_11]: How about fuck you, and I'm just going to carry the regular PSP where I can sell the same games.

650
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:30,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, not all the games were available digitally right away anyways, so what's the point?

651
00:47:32,043 --> 00:47:34,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the problem, is they pissed everybody off.

652
00:47:34,245 --> 00:47:38,428
[SPEAKER_11]: It was also more expensive than the PSP was, which made no fucking sense whatsoever.

653
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,532
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was just a bad...

654
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:44,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Bad plan altogether.

655
00:47:45,899 --> 00:47:52,721
[SPEAKER_11]: You should have charged less for it since it didn't have UMD drive and it would have gotten people to actually maybe pick it up.

656
00:47:53,201 --> 00:48:08,825
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was absolutely no reason whatsoever to pick up a PSP Go because you could just buy a PSP 3000 and a memory unit and have basically the exact same thing and the flexibility to either buy your games on disk or buy them via digital download.

657
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:15,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I missed all the PSP hate, and I hate it too, the go.

658
00:48:15,207 --> 00:48:15,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was dumb.

659
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:18,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I will share a quick little story.

660
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:27,695
[SPEAKER_04]: At the store I work at, which I'm sure I can't name or get fired, we have sold, I kid you not, since the system came out, three.

661
00:48:28,476 --> 00:48:28,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Just three.

662
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:32,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talked everybody that I could out of it, because...

663
00:48:33,659 --> 00:48:38,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like you're saying, a PSP-3000 with a decent-sized memory stick.

664
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:42,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as good and way better, actually, than the Go could ever be.

665
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:47,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, if you buy the Sony memory sticks, then maybe it might be, you know, somewhat of a good deal.

666
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:54,933
[SPEAKER_11]: But since everybody doesn't, you know, double the retail price of their memory units, you could go buy a third-party SanDisk memory stick and it'd be just fine.

667
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:04,216
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's assuming if you want to download all your damn games, which most people are not going to do that because you can buy a PSP game on disk.

668
00:49:04,636 --> 00:49:05,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're done with it, guess what?

669
00:49:06,517 --> 00:49:09,618
[SPEAKER_11]: You could sell it and make your money back.

670
00:49:10,058 --> 00:49:14,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget about our friend who has had all the trouble with his downloads, too.

671
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:19,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have no problem with those digital download games that are only available via digital download.

672
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,125
[SPEAKER_11]: But guess what?

673
00:49:20,145 --> 00:49:22,706
[SPEAKER_11]: With the PSP 3000, you can also download those!

674
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:29,351
[SPEAKER_11]: They just were trying to make it seem like the PSP Go was the only system able to access this marketplace.

675
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:34,254
[SPEAKER_11]: And the problem was they were trying to basically compete with the iPhone or something like that.

676
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:38,317
[SPEAKER_11]: But you kind of have to have those types of features in there, like GPS and...

677
00:49:38,837 --> 00:49:40,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever actually held one?

678
00:49:55,413 --> 00:49:55,513
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

679
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:58,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they feel like plastic little toys.

680
00:49:58,874 --> 00:49:59,634
[SPEAKER_04]: They are awful.

681
00:49:59,974 --> 00:50:01,294
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel like you're going to break it.

682
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:04,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that top screen alone does not feel very secure.

683
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:09,516
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're sliding it up and down, I can only imagine that it won't last, like it will break.

684
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:22,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Quickly, kind of one big rumor, big, big rumor that's floating around about what we're going to hear in a couple days, namely Tuesday morning when Sony does their press conference, we may hear something about a PSP 2.

685
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think there's any truth to that rumor?

686
00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:33,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if it's going to come out, it's going to come out probably around the same time frame as Gran Turismo 3, which means in a few years.

687
00:50:34,526 --> 00:50:35,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean Gran Turismo 5?

688
00:50:35,627 --> 00:50:35,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

689
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:38,449
[SPEAKER_11]: 5-3, it doesn't matter.

690
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:41,792
[SPEAKER_04]: The game isn't coming up this year, that's what it matters.

691
00:50:41,992 --> 00:50:44,334
[SPEAKER_14]: At first, I was like, no, they're not doing it.

692
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:48,417
[SPEAKER_14]: But now that I'm hearing this whole disavowing of the PSP Go...

693
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:52,466
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes a lot more sense that that could be where they're going.

694
00:50:52,546 --> 00:50:55,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Three is the number of Forza games that will be out before Gran Turismo 5.

695
00:50:57,608 --> 00:50:57,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

696
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:00,649
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean additional Forza games.

697
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyond the third one we've already had.

698
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:03,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Beyond two and three, yeah.

699
00:51:04,389 --> 00:51:05,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I like my PSP.

700
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:07,270
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the PSP is a pretty good system.

701
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,430
[SPEAKER_14]: It was lacking in games for a while.

702
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:10,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, Luminous was cool.

703
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,391
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was really lacking in games for a while.

704
00:51:13,431 --> 00:51:15,491
[SPEAKER_14]: But then it started getting some real kick-butt stuff.

705
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially with the Final Fantasy games were re-released for it.

706
00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:19,992
[SPEAKER_14]: It had some good stuff.

707
00:51:20,152 --> 00:51:21,112
[SPEAKER_11]: But I gotta be honest, though.

708
00:51:21,172 --> 00:51:24,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Even with just regular PSP, it's not been doing great.

709
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:30,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even just talking to my retailers about bringing in PSP titles, they're really just...

710
00:51:30,914 --> 00:51:35,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Bringing in some to have them on the shelf, but it's not a big representation.

711
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,383
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's kind of hurting them.

712
00:51:39,403 --> 00:51:44,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially now with the 3DS, people are going to be like, whatever, I'm not buying anything on the PSP.

713
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,670
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've got to come out with something new.

714
00:51:48,212 --> 00:51:49,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be out this year?

715
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:50,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I highly doubt it.

716
00:51:51,511 --> 00:51:53,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Osfer brings up Valkyria Chronicles 2.

717
00:51:53,793 --> 00:51:55,274
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like it might be pretty cool.

718
00:51:55,374 --> 00:51:59,617
[SPEAKER_04]: The Phantasy Star Portable 2 is also coming, which is somewhat big to people I know.

719
00:51:59,877 --> 00:52:06,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Alpha Catanagram in our chatroom is mentioning that there is a giant Kevin Butler E3 banner, apparently, at the convention center right now.

720
00:52:06,622 --> 00:52:09,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I need to say something since you mentioned Phantasy Star Portable.

721
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:09,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

722
00:52:10,764 --> 00:52:21,589
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Krista, if you go on Sega's website and look at the contest that they did for doing fan art, she won third place doing pixel style art of the characters.

723
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:22,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

724
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:23,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to Krista.

725
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:24,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Congrats to you.

726
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,811
[SPEAKER_14]: What does she win?

727
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:26,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Copy the game.

728
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:27,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hey, that's something.

729
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:29,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Free stuff is good.

730
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:30,153
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

731
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:32,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts

732
00:52:38,348 --> 00:52:43,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts Kingdom Hearts has got a new game announced at E3, but it's not the big number three.

733
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:45,751
[SPEAKER_14]: It is Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

734
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:47,551
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a rumor about this on last week's show.

735
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:48,752
[SPEAKER_14]: It does look like it is official.

736
00:52:49,192 --> 00:52:51,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts Recoded is coming out for the DS.

737
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:58,375
[SPEAKER_14]: It's by the same people that were behind 358 slash two days, and it will be on the show floor at E3.

738
00:52:58,795 --> 00:53:03,477
[SPEAKER_14]: It apparently is going to be a remake of the Japanese mobile game Kingdom Hearts Coded.

739
00:53:03,837 --> 00:53:05,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like they did with Chains of Memories.

740
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:07,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember Kingdom Hearts Re Chains of Memories?

741
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:07,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

742
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:10,576
[SPEAKER_14]: No word on the release date yet.

743
00:53:10,616 --> 00:53:12,197
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know if it's going to be this year or next.

744
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:13,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully this Christmas.

745
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:19,202
[SPEAKER_14]: But it will be about Sora retracing his steps through the original Kingdom Hearts.

746
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:26,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Jiminy Cricket apparently is looking over the journal he used to document his first adventure with Sora and he discovers a mysterious message.

747
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:27,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

748
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:28,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not something he wrote?

749
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:29,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So how did it get there?

750
00:53:29,969 --> 00:53:30,389
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

751
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:33,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds confusing, just like the plot of Kingdom Hearts.

752
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:35,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I roll my eyes to.

753
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:36,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

754
00:53:37,473 --> 00:53:38,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts is not that great.

755
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:40,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of boring.

756
00:53:40,876 --> 00:53:41,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's pretty cool.

757
00:53:41,556 --> 00:53:43,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Was the message sitting on the toilet?

758
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on with some more gaming news.

759
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, you got something for us?

760
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:52,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nuts.

761
00:53:54,445 --> 00:53:54,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Me too.

762
00:53:57,938 --> 00:54:01,700
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is actually about our good friends at Capcom.

763
00:54:02,961 --> 00:54:07,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their E3 lineup and I'm pretty excited.

764
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:14,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Fate of Two Worlds, which by the way I saw the last trailer and it has Deadpool and Dante and that made me very squee.

765
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:28,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Okamiden, Bionic Commando Rearmed 2, Sengoku Basara Samurai Heroes, Ghost Trick Phantom Detective, Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 2 Case Zero, MotoGP 910.

766
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:33,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So it sounds like Capcom's booth is going to be pretty hopping.

767
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:35,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is playable.

768
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:37,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Take me lots of pictures and get me lots of swag.

769
00:54:38,202 --> 00:54:38,482
[SPEAKER_14]: I will.

770
00:54:38,762 --> 00:54:39,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I really want to play it.

771
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Deadpool stuff.

772
00:54:41,205 --> 00:54:42,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I will play as Deadpool just for you.

773
00:54:43,087 --> 00:54:43,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You better.

774
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:45,249
[SPEAKER_14]: And he'll be terrible.

775
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:47,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I will because I'm terrible at Marvel vs. Capcom.

776
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:49,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But Deadpool has guns and snark.

777
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:50,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that's not true.

778
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:54,999
[SPEAKER_14]: When I played at that retro arcade a couple weeks ago in Portland, I just kind of button mashed and I did pretty good.

779
00:54:56,812 --> 00:55:05,876
[SPEAKER_14]: all I you just do you know it's all Street Fighter moves like quarter circle forward and and back and forward and you know it's just all it's all Street Fighter moves you just do a bunch of Street Fighter moves and then your characters are going well

780
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:07,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising 2 K-Zero

781
00:55:34,934 --> 00:55:37,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Showing off a demo at E3 of a demo.

782
00:55:37,882 --> 00:55:38,644
[SPEAKER_04]: A demo of a demo.

783
00:55:38,824 --> 00:55:39,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

784
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:39,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

785
00:55:41,817 --> 00:55:53,004
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an editorial written on Kotaku this week talking about the trend going on with these new sports games from THQ and EA.

786
00:55:54,145 --> 00:56:05,733
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember the one-time use online codes that are part of the Project $10, or I guess in THQ's case, we want another $5 from you.

787
00:56:08,174 --> 00:56:11,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought there were some points that were kind of interesting that they brought up in this.

788
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:21,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of it kind of tying into will it really be that big a deal for consumers out there that are interested in buying used products because it's going to be additional money.

789
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:28,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they were saying that GameStop has been starting to drop in the trade-in values of different games.

790
00:56:29,273 --> 00:56:33,356
[SPEAKER_11]: For most new releases, which you used to be able to get for $30, you're now getting $25.

791
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:59,017
[SPEAKER_11]: and also some of the games like for example UFC the use price is now $44.99 which is $5 cheaper than the other new releases so they're kind of factoring in okay you're going to pay another $5 to get online and it's going to bring it up to the price of a normal use game or a normal use game of that quality that time frame that kind of stuff.

792
00:57:00,038 --> 00:57:02,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so maybe it won't be that big of an impact.

793
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:17,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I still say don't forget what's going on, though, because as soon as you say, well, that's not so bad, you know, that's when they start going, okay, well, now you're gonna be having to pay for this, and you're gonna have to pay for this, and pay for this, and this, and this, and this, and just gonna go on and on.

794
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,572
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, also they're saying that, uh, the...

795
00:57:24,323 --> 00:57:29,933
[SPEAKER_11]: One-time use code has diminished resale expectations.

796
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:35,743
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying that people who tend to be passionate about games on their consoles...

797
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:42,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been selling them back in.

798
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:43,478
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

799
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:44,539
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting, though.

800
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this is going to keep going on.

801
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:57,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, there was a rumor, and I'm sure we're not going to hear anything about it until the game comes out, but it is a few weeks from now that Microsoft will be following suit with Crackdown 2.

802
00:57:57,573 --> 00:57:58,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Get ready.

803
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:08,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm kind of irritated because yet another reason that I don't know if it was so obvious at first, but it just diminishes the value of the game to be able to resell.

804
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:16,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if you do get the $10 code for free when it's new, if you use it, it's totally diminishing the value of the game that you sell back.

805
00:58:17,236 --> 00:58:19,557
[SPEAKER_14]: And that I think is probably one of the most irritating components of this.

806
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:25,282
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the end of the day, the only way that you can express your distaste

807
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:26,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

808
00:58:45,414 --> 00:59:11,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't buy used games anymore and a lot of stuff if I'm going to buy it in the first place I'm buying it new if I'm not buying it right when it comes out new then I'm not going to buy it at all so for me since this is really just affecting used games and stuff like that it's not a big deal now if I wanted to loan it to a friend or something like that that kind of sucks for them but I don't really run into that situation that much

809
00:59:13,786 --> 00:59:18,288
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's got guys in their skeevies over there.

810
00:59:18,328 --> 00:59:19,288
[SPEAKER_14]: What is going on over there?

811
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just picking his pajamas.

812
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:23,010
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not pajamas.

813
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:26,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known guys who just sleep in their underwear.

814
00:59:26,371 --> 00:59:27,771
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I know, but I'm just saying.

815
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:29,832
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just funny because I looked over.

816
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:30,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, what is she playing?

817
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:34,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the pajamas in the game, so I just had him sleep in his undies.

818
00:59:35,254 --> 00:59:37,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But his undies are Calvin Klein.

819
00:59:37,455 --> 00:59:39,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded Calvin Klein undies.

820
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,437
[SPEAKER_14]: You should get him bananas in pajamas.

821
00:59:45,067 --> 00:59:48,268
[SPEAKER_14]: If you really want, I don't care.

822
00:59:49,668 --> 00:59:50,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Loki.

823
00:59:50,849 --> 00:59:51,349
[SPEAKER_14]: I looked over there.

824
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:54,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, is DarkSakura watching porn during this program?

825
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:54,690
[SPEAKER_14]: What is she doing?

826
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,091
[SPEAKER_14]: What is she doing?

827
00:59:57,451 --> 00:59:57,691
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

828
00:59:58,131 --> 00:59:59,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's just interesting because...

829
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:17,701
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it just seems to me their excuses for why they're doing it being that they're going to enhance the online, enhance all this community stuff I just have a feeling they're not going to deliver with that in that it's just a desperate cash grab

830
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:19,342
[SPEAKER_04]: If they really do that, that's cool.

831
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm fine with the extra $10 or whatever they're saying.

832
01:00:23,206 --> 01:00:30,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, it's just taking a key component of the game and charging you for it when it should already be there as part of the normal cost.

833
01:00:30,774 --> 01:00:33,556
[SPEAKER_11]: My problem is why they're getting money anyways for a used sale.

834
01:00:34,317 --> 01:00:36,239
[SPEAKER_11]: They really shouldn't deserve that kind of money.

835
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:37,259
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't.

836
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:38,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a comment about that.

837
01:01:02,546 --> 01:01:15,359
[SPEAKER_04]: With UFC, didn't they implement that so badly that some people that even bought it brand new got double charged because the directions weren't clear when you'd enter the code and it would actually make you pay for the code and then you could use your code?

838
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:17,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I read stuff about that when it came out.

839
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:18,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

840
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:22,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not surprised if that's what actually happened.

841
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:29,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, moving on.

842
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:31,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Boy, I'm just seeing this from chat.

843
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:32,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody just posted this in chat.

844
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:34,023
[SPEAKER_04]: You need the breaking news noise.

845
01:01:34,063 --> 01:01:35,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I need the breaking news noise?

846
01:01:35,363 --> 01:01:36,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's ugly.

847
01:01:36,364 --> 01:01:37,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have the breaking news noise.

848
01:01:38,944 --> 01:01:40,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Buy me some time.

849
01:01:40,525 --> 01:01:41,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy me some time.

850
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:43,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick.

851
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:45,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking noise, breaking noise, breaking noise.

852
01:01:45,486 --> 01:01:46,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Breaking noise.

853
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:49,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Breaking news, breaking news, blah blah blah.

854
01:01:50,251 --> 01:02:00,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I could talk about how I am breeding stuff in Pokemon and I bike back and forth on the path so it hatches the eggs quicker because I don't like to run around.

855
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:01,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

856
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's still very popular in Japan.

857
01:02:34,106 --> 01:02:37,589
[SPEAKER_14]: You can play this game.

858
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:40,291
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess a new version of pop music has been announced, but here's the thing.

859
01:02:40,751 --> 01:02:46,195
[SPEAKER_14]: It is like a US version now because they're testing this in Irvine, California.

860
01:02:46,215 --> 01:02:49,517
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a ticket redemption machine.

861
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,058
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate you, Konami.

862
01:02:51,439 --> 01:02:52,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you so much.

863
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,622
[SPEAKER_04]: The logo looks like it's from Beat and Groovy.

864
01:02:55,922 --> 01:02:56,562
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of does.

865
01:02:57,642 --> 01:02:59,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami, you just don't get it anymore.

866
01:02:59,303 --> 01:02:59,984
[SPEAKER_11]: You're fired.

867
01:03:00,684 --> 01:03:01,885
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm firing you, Konami.

868
01:03:01,905 --> 01:03:03,327
[SPEAKER_11]: You cannot make any more music games.

869
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:10,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Konami, a company that thinks Saw is a viable franchise for video games.

870
01:03:11,064 --> 01:03:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: That Saw game was not awful.

871
01:03:13,146 --> 01:03:16,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I will defend that game because it was fun except for the combat.

872
01:03:16,068 --> 01:03:18,230
[SPEAKER_04]: The combat was dumb, but the puzzles were fun.

873
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:19,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked them.

874
01:03:19,811 --> 01:03:21,392
[SPEAKER_04]: You just like to kill people horrifically.

875
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:22,913
[SPEAKER_04]: With really good puzzles.

876
01:03:24,374 --> 01:03:26,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like evil Professor Layton.

877
01:03:26,496 --> 01:03:27,737
[SPEAKER_11]: That should be a game right there.

878
01:03:27,817 --> 01:03:28,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Kill them with puzzles.

879
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:29,878
[SPEAKER_14]: For the 3DS.

880
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:36,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami in our chat says, Sky, and you keep saying Konami needs to redesign their rhythm games.

881
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:38,128
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what I meant!

882
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:40,210
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what I fucking meant!

883
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:42,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Ticket game?

884
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:44,555
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not surprised, one bit.

885
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:45,716
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be popular.

886
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,368
[SPEAKER_04]: If the Deal or No Deal game is popular, no, this won't be because it's not something you see on TV with Howie Mandel.

887
01:03:52,889 --> 01:03:53,230
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

888
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:58,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby's World, the Ticket Redemption game, that would be something that would be popular with Howie Mandel.

889
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:00,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's on the... America's Got Talent.

890
01:04:00,881 --> 01:04:01,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that show.

891
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:11,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of the Saw type things and so forth, there was a lot of news that came out this week about Mortal Kombat.

892
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:17,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of them was this very strange teaser that was a mystery and nobody knew what it was.

893
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:18,768
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to play a little bit here in studio.

894
01:04:18,848 --> 01:04:19,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it loud?

895
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:19,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

896
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:20,169
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this.

897
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:20,749
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

898
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:21,049
[SPEAKER_02]: That one?

899
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:26,075
[SPEAKER_14]: This thing that came out this week.

900
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:26,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that?

901
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:27,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

902
01:04:28,157 --> 01:04:30,200
[SPEAKER_14]: That's supposed to be like reptile.

903
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:31,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?

904
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:33,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's actually old.

905
01:04:33,964 --> 01:04:36,046
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy was friends with Jerry Ryan, which is why she's in it.

906
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:40,813
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually is a few months old.

907
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:41,953
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jerry Ryan's in it.

908
01:04:59,986 --> 01:05:00,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Jerry Ryan is in it.

909
01:05:00,807 --> 01:05:01,868
[SPEAKER_14]: She's Sonya at the very end.

910
01:05:01,889 --> 01:05:03,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see if I can fast forward the part.

911
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:07,536
[SPEAKER_04]: And Johnny Cage is the motion actor for Nathan Drake from Uncharted 1.

912
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:08,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really?

913
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:09,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's Jerry Ryan.

914
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:13,761
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

915
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:41,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I love these reimagining pitches though.

916
01:05:41,379 --> 01:05:45,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the one for Nightmare on Elm Street before they had decided to redo it.

917
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,040
[SPEAKER_02]: That some guy just funded.

918
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:52,922
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of a really ballsy thing for them to do is to put it up on the internet for all the public scrutiny.

919
01:05:53,302 --> 01:05:57,543
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy must have believed in the thing that much and so far the reception's been pretty positive.

920
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:58,543
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

921
01:05:58,844 --> 01:05:59,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta be honest.

922
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:01,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna go against the grain a little bit.

923
01:06:01,484 --> 01:06:03,585
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's well done and it's nice but...

924
01:06:04,705 --> 01:06:08,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I always kind of liked Mortal Kombat because it was a little bit over the top and cartoony.

925
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:13,310
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was a little bit like gritty, real saw for me.

926
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:13,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

927
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:15,351
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how I feel about that.

928
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:21,055
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that's how the movie would actually turn out, but I was kind of like, I kind of like Mortal Kombat because it was always a little bit ridiculous.

929
01:06:21,075 --> 01:06:22,455
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one did it best.

930
01:06:23,176 --> 01:06:24,737
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one was a waste of time.

931
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:31,002
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm all for, I guess, them trying to give this guy a chance, especially since so many people seem to be into it.

932
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:34,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just because I have one opinion, you know, whatever, I guess I might get outvoted.

933
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,424
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I guess it could be cool.

934
01:06:37,484 --> 01:06:44,527
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was really seven minutes of this cop interrogation, and I would just hope the movie is a little... Well, no, it wasn't just the interrogation.

935
01:06:44,587 --> 01:06:46,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... Yeah, I guess it had the fight with Johnny Cage.

936
01:06:46,847 --> 01:06:48,928
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like introducing the characters.

937
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:51,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was awesome, and they should totally make the movie.

938
01:06:54,195 --> 01:06:54,975
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see, we'll see.

939
01:06:54,995 --> 01:06:56,596
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my least favorite character in the series.

940
01:06:56,616 --> 01:06:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Johnny Cage, can't catch a break.

941
01:06:59,037 --> 01:07:02,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I did like doing the foot through the heart and then signing the autograph.

942
01:07:02,379 --> 01:07:03,059
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cool.

943
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:21,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well also, you know, because a lot of people did mistake that this might have been a teaser for the game, apparently there really was a teaser for the game in the works and it showed up a little later, just literally a few days later, a new teaser for Mortal Kombat 9 showed up.

944
01:07:22,188 --> 01:07:22,508
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.

945
01:07:46,347 --> 01:07:47,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see more characters added.

946
01:07:47,608 --> 01:07:52,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this is just a teaser, but they didn't pick some of the best, that's for sure.

947
01:08:14,764 --> 01:08:16,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that hat on the ground is really funny.

948
01:08:16,585 --> 01:08:30,373
[SPEAKER_14]: For those that haven't seen the trailer, Kung Lao puts the hat on the ground and it starts spinning like a circular saw and he starts grabbing Sub-Zero and pulling him towards it like he's going to rip his body in half with the saw, starting with his wiener.

949
01:08:32,954 --> 01:08:34,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, interesting.

950
01:08:36,076 --> 01:08:41,479
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit over the top, but I don't know, again, they're starting to get a little too realistic.

951
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:43,660
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I liked Mortal Kombat when it was cartoony and dumb.

952
01:08:43,942 --> 01:08:45,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we're at 9, like you said.

953
01:08:45,905 --> 01:08:50,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an insane amount for a lot of forgettable titles in the series.

954
01:08:50,652 --> 01:08:52,855
[SPEAKER_14]: I always kind of had an appreciation for Mortal Kombat.

955
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I always thought a lot of them were really underrated and they're a lot of fun.

956
01:08:55,519 --> 01:08:58,103
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just dumb fun and that's the important part of the game.

957
01:08:58,904 --> 01:08:59,344
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you go.

958
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:04,151
[SPEAKER_14]: That is supposedly also at the E3 show floor.

959
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:07,435
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some big banners hanging from the ceiling teasing the new Mortal Kombat game.

960
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:09,878
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know I definitely want to stop by and check that out.

961
01:09:09,898 --> 01:09:10,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if we can get one.

962
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you could prop me up and I'll... No, the banner.

963
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:16,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop me up and I'll take it down and we'll steal it.

964
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:20,350
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the show floor is like... Or the ceiling is, you know...

965
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:21,631
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

966
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:48,222
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's move on to some release dates.

967
01:09:48,282 --> 01:09:53,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Travel around the world and talk about what is coming out soon to a retail store near you.

968
01:09:53,283 --> 01:09:56,264
[SPEAKER_14]: We go to the UK and the US and Japan.

969
01:09:56,284 --> 01:09:57,725
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to start off with Loki in the US.

970
01:09:58,805 --> 01:10:03,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you know it's going to be a wonderful week since the biggest title coming out this week is Toy Story 3.

971
01:10:05,127 --> 01:10:10,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Toy Story 3 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii DS, and PSP and PC.

972
01:10:12,702 --> 01:10:13,902
[SPEAKER_11]: And now the rest of the crap.

973
01:10:14,683 --> 01:10:18,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's play Garden, coming out on DS this week.

974
01:10:18,604 --> 01:10:22,405
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the Wii, let's play Ballerina, coming out on DS and the Wii.

975
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:24,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's play Ballerina!

976
01:10:24,225 --> 01:10:25,145
[SPEAKER_11]: 100 classic books.

977
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:29,626
[SPEAKER_11]: The only game released on the DS that actually wasn't rated by the ESRB.

978
01:10:29,787 --> 01:10:31,647
[SPEAKER_11]: The most boring video game ever made.

979
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's books.

980
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:36,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that'd be a great, great $20 spent.

981
01:10:36,828 --> 01:10:38,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Video game called Let's Go to the Library.

982
01:10:39,828 --> 01:10:42,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of K coming to the Nintendo DS.

983
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:47,534
[SPEAKER_11]: XGBlast, supposed to be like a shmup game, coming to the Nintendo DS.

984
01:10:48,775 --> 01:10:52,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Superbike World Championship, SBK, coming to the PS3.

985
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:53,799
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a budget game.

986
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:56,441
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

987
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:57,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Kid Adventure Sky Captain.

988
01:10:58,082 --> 01:10:59,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, this one looks okay.

989
01:10:59,162 --> 01:11:00,983
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like Pilotwings on the Wii.

990
01:11:01,204 --> 01:11:02,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Also only a budget game.

991
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:06,167
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this is the kind of stuff that Konami keeps putting out.

992
01:11:06,247 --> 01:11:07,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Konami.

993
01:11:07,187 --> 01:11:07,888
[SPEAKER_11]: You're wonderful.

994
01:11:07,988 --> 01:11:10,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Yard Sale, Hidden Treasures, Sunnyville.

995
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:13,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Guess where you're going to find this game in a yard sale.

996
01:11:13,551 --> 01:11:13,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, wait.

997
01:11:13,971 --> 01:11:14,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Sunnyvale?

998
01:11:15,132 --> 01:11:15,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Sunnyville.

999
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:18,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I was going to say it's like a game set in Sunnyvale.

1000
01:11:18,134 --> 01:11:18,694
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of cool.

1001
01:11:18,959 --> 01:11:24,582
[SPEAKER_11]: ThinkSmart Western Riding Academy Naval Assault The Killing Tide Xbox 360

1002
01:11:45,013 --> 01:12:11,805
[SPEAKER_11]: and another crappy game on the Wii Family Game Show which is gonna be some stupid party game by a company I've never heard of, Storm City Games and last but not least I Spy Universe, who gives a shit I don't care what system it's on the end Ray Ayanami in chat says there aren't enough games set in the SF Bay Area how about every racing game ever made always has like some type of San Francisco stage because of the hills

1003
01:12:13,539 --> 01:12:20,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Although I will tell you, in real life, folks, you go about three miles an hour down all of those roads because there's always traffic.

1004
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:29,539
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to have a San Francisco level because you know San Francisco, what it's most known for, earthquakes, because every game that has a disaster in it, San Francisco has the earthquakes.

1005
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:31,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Cruising USA, heads.

1006
01:12:33,277 --> 01:12:34,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Blur has a San Francisco level.

1007
01:12:34,638 --> 01:12:35,058
[SPEAKER_14]: They all do.

1008
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:36,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Every single one of them.

1009
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:37,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Mario Kart has a San Francisco level.

1010
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,121
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

1011
01:12:38,741 --> 01:12:40,422
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Toad San Francisco Adventure.

1012
01:12:40,442 --> 01:12:43,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Blur, by the way, in Mario Kart, did you see that commercial?

1013
01:12:43,605 --> 01:12:44,566
[SPEAKER_14]: It is amazing.

1014
01:12:44,686 --> 01:12:45,927
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the best thing I've seen.

1015
01:12:47,348 --> 01:12:53,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan was watching Classic Game Room and it was the leading in commercial and I laughed my butt off.

1016
01:12:54,033 --> 01:12:54,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Good times.

1017
01:12:55,054 --> 01:12:58,636
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you fitting your little guy in panties over there?

1018
01:12:58,696 --> 01:13:00,758
[SPEAKER_14]: He looks like he's wearing panties, manties.

1019
01:13:01,337 --> 01:13:10,067
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm picking his bathing suit and I'm just trying out different fabric patterns Guys don't really wear that to the beach at least in America I realize like Greece it's a little different but we're all fat

1020
01:13:11,852 --> 01:13:13,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying different fabrics.

1021
01:13:13,633 --> 01:13:14,794
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure.

1022
01:13:14,834 --> 01:13:17,436
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Nintendo should want to make sure you were aware.

1023
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use gold sequins.

1024
01:13:19,257 --> 01:13:19,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Gold sequins.

1025
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:30,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo should really come out with a commercial later on for its next Mario Kart game and say, yeah, Blur wants to go ahead and make fun of our games, but our game's still millions of copies.

1026
01:13:30,525 --> 01:13:31,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours doesn't.

1027
01:13:31,966 --> 01:13:32,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you.

1028
01:13:33,567 --> 01:13:36,348
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes with a plate and a pillowcase and a clock

1029
01:14:02,054 --> 01:14:03,935
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a whole big franchise out there.

1030
01:14:03,975 --> 01:14:06,095
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually an anime based on it as well.

1031
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,457
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the Hakioki is coming out there on PS3.

1032
01:14:09,477 --> 01:14:11,057
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's a pretty big release over there this week.

1033
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:20,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Also on the other systems, going to the Nintendo Wii, Hospital 6 Nin no Ishii is coming out in Japan from Atlus.

1034
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,221
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if this is a Trauma Center game.

1035
01:14:22,301 --> 01:14:22,861
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's not.

1036
01:14:22,981 --> 01:14:24,502
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it's maybe a spinoff or something.

1037
01:14:24,542 --> 01:14:28,223
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a different hospital game, but there is your mandatory chick with big boobs.

1038
01:14:28,303 --> 01:14:28,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1039
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:30,404
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's Trauma Center.

1040
01:14:30,564 --> 01:14:30,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it really?

1041
01:14:30,984 --> 01:14:31,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the one that we just got.

1042
01:14:31,944 --> 01:14:32,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like an anime or something.

1043
01:14:32,985 --> 01:14:34,505
[SPEAKER_04]: The characters are exactly the same.

1044
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:35,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1045
01:14:35,066 --> 01:14:36,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It just looks so different.

1046
01:14:37,186 --> 01:14:39,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Trauma Team, that's what the American one's called.

1047
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:40,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Weird.

1048
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:43,169
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, maybe it's the release of Trauma Team then.

1049
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,492
[SPEAKER_14]: I define better Dark Sakura when you're showing me that guy.

1050
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:52,312
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Fishnet?

1051
01:14:53,353 --> 01:14:53,753
[SPEAKER_14]: No, thank you.

1052
01:14:54,507 --> 01:15:01,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Also on the Nintendo DS this week, Igokoro Koyushitsu comes out on the Nintendo DS this week.

1053
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:05,293
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a game where apparently you... I don't even know what this is.

1054
01:15:05,353 --> 01:15:08,795
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like apples on the cover with the stylus.

1055
01:15:09,175 --> 01:15:10,256
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like Let's Draw Apples.

1056
01:15:10,336 --> 01:15:11,297
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if it's a painting game.

1057
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:12,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet that's what it is.

1058
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:12,657
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a painting game.

1059
01:15:13,438 --> 01:15:15,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's probably Let's Paint on the DS.

1060
01:15:15,459 --> 01:15:16,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Learn how to paint apples.

1061
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:17,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Still life.

1062
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:20,442
[SPEAKER_14]: They did have a Let's Paint game on the Wii.

1063
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:20,742
[SPEAKER_14]: That is...

1064
01:15:21,186 --> 01:15:21,787
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a painting game.

1065
01:15:23,548 --> 01:15:27,933
[SPEAKER_14]: And then lastly on the PSP, nothing this week.

1066
01:15:28,613 --> 01:15:32,897
[SPEAKER_14]: But next week you get Project D.Va from Sega on the PSP.

1067
01:15:33,378 --> 01:15:34,159
[SPEAKER_14]: You have that to look forward to.

1068
01:15:34,778 --> 01:15:36,559
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

1069
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:37,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff.

1070
01:15:38,621 --> 01:15:40,702
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 13th, Mytheon for PC.

1071
01:15:41,343 --> 01:15:44,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 16th, we have Ancients of Uga.

1072
01:15:44,925 --> 01:15:45,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1073
01:15:46,387 --> 01:16:00,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the 18th, we have Everybody's Tennis, I'm Not Alone, International Cricket 2010, Project Runway, and Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker on PSP.

1074
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:02,398
[SPEAKER_02]: and Amiro.

1075
01:16:02,458 --> 01:16:02,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1076
01:16:27,935 --> 01:16:32,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's talk a little bit about 3D on PS3.

1077
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:41,245
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, this week we actually got an update on the PS3 firmware to allow for some games to support stereoscopic 3D.

1078
01:16:42,726 --> 01:16:50,712
[SPEAKER_11]: These games, of course, would be Wipeout HD, Pain, Super Stardust HD, and Motorstorm Pacific Rift.

1079
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:53,454
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a demo, apparently, with I think one level that was in 3D.

1080
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:57,961
[SPEAKER_11]: and White Battle wants to see if his own 3D paint has a 3D level.

1081
01:16:59,691 --> 01:17:08,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was actually one of the reasons that the... Back in the day, remember when they were doing the Gorillaz holographic thing for their concerts?

1082
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-huh.

1083
01:17:10,621 --> 01:17:21,791
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing the projections and everything, and they said that they had to keep sound around it at a particular level, or it would start making the light waves start jitter.

1084
01:17:22,532 --> 01:17:24,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had that problem when they did with Madonna.

1085
01:17:24,714 --> 01:17:24,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1086
01:17:25,614 --> 01:17:43,679
[SPEAKER_02]: because when her song started in it was that heavy bass and it made the holograms jitter well being that this isn't holograms hopefully we won't have that problem but it's still a matter of sight and perception and it's still the waves themselves are still a physical thing

1087
01:17:44,144 --> 01:17:46,526
[SPEAKER_14]: The only holograms I want to see are fronted by Jim.

1088
01:17:47,527 --> 01:17:51,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this, I mean, looks kind of cool, but, you know, it's one of those things.

1089
01:17:52,711 --> 01:18:00,617
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not buying a new damn TV, and I'm not buying, you know, expensive glasses to go with these TVs just for some of these games.

1090
01:18:00,737 --> 01:18:05,300
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one of those things where when the technology comes down in price in about five years, I think more people will have it.

1091
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:07,702
[SPEAKER_14]: But right now, I think this is a little too soon.

1092
01:18:08,223 --> 01:18:11,045
[SPEAKER_14]: But I am so, like, over the 3D craze.

1093
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:11,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I just...

1094
01:18:12,686 --> 01:18:18,049
[SPEAKER_14]: I see all these movies coming out in 3D, like there's the Resident Evil movie in 3D, and the new Saws movie in 3D.

1095
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:19,070
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't need to be in 3D.

1096
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:21,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything is in 3D, and I'm over it.

1097
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:22,752
[SPEAKER_14]: 3D movies make me sick.

1098
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:23,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop it.

1099
01:18:23,973 --> 01:18:25,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked Avatar in 3D.

1100
01:18:27,014 --> 01:18:30,957
[SPEAKER_14]: But Avatar, I would have felt just as fine with Avatar in 2D.

1101
01:18:32,426 --> 01:18:34,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Having seen it both ways, I really did prefer it in 3D.

1102
01:18:34,748 --> 01:18:35,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's the thing.

1103
01:18:35,828 --> 01:18:43,993
[SPEAKER_11]: With Avatar or something like that, when they're filming that movie, it's just like a normal movie just filmed in 3D.

1104
01:18:44,414 --> 01:18:53,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas a lot of people, when you film something in 3D, they want to do a lot of stuff to really capitalize on the 3D, like throw stuff at you or have you fly around really fast or something like that.

1105
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:16,640
[SPEAKER_11]: and that's great and all but it's this isn't like an amusement park ride I mean we don't really need that kind of stuff just make a good movie and that'd be it now the motion box seats that's more amusement park fare and god please do not have that trend make its way to consoles I don't need a moving couch

1106
01:19:19,292 --> 01:19:25,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, another music game was announced this week that's going to be showing its way at the Florida E3 this year.

1107
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:27,157
[SPEAKER_14]: It's DJ Hero 2.

1108
01:19:28,078 --> 01:19:31,420
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, some folks were saying that DJ Hero didn't really sell what they were hoping it would.

1109
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, didn't DJ Hero kind of keep selling?

1110
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:37,224
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, maybe it didn't sell a lot at the beginning, but it kind of has kept selling?

1111
01:19:37,384 --> 01:19:37,945
[SPEAKER_14]: It's done okay.

1112
01:19:38,165 --> 01:19:42,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for, like, a brand new franchise, you know, it did alright.

1113
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:49,072
[SPEAKER_11]: And considering how much they've supported their download content, in other words, not at all, I'm surprised it sold what it did.

1114
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:53,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was some content released this week in celebration of DJ Hero 2.

1115
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:56,040
[SPEAKER_14]: They did release some free content this week.

1116
01:19:56,761 --> 01:20:03,930
[SPEAKER_14]: It is DJ Hero 2's mix for Just Dance by Lady Gaga with Ghosts and Stuff by Deadmau5.

1117
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's listen to a little bit of it here.

1118
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:21,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's alright.

1119
01:20:22,363 --> 01:20:22,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds kind of fun.

1120
01:20:23,965 --> 01:20:26,628
[SPEAKER_14]: So 70 new songs are supposed to be coming to DJ Hero 2.

1121
01:20:27,109 --> 01:20:31,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Kanye West, Chemical Brothers, Dr. Dre, Gaga, Rihanna, Metallica.

1122
01:20:31,775 --> 01:20:33,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots and lots and lots of artists are going to be in this.

1123
01:20:34,337 --> 01:20:38,200
[SPEAKER_14]: The sequel will also be putting in microphone gameplay.

1124
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:41,141
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also going to have a lot more of two turntables at once.

1125
01:20:41,362 --> 01:20:45,364
[SPEAKER_14]: So literally you will have, yes, two turntables and a microphone.

1126
01:20:46,104 --> 01:20:48,126
[SPEAKER_14]: How many times have you heard that joke this week?

1127
01:20:48,146 --> 01:20:50,267
[SPEAKER_14]: They totally have to put Beck in there then.

1128
01:20:51,278 --> 01:20:53,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's interesting that they have the karaoke mode in there.

1129
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:56,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's kind of cool to have an additional person playing.

1130
01:20:57,125 --> 01:21:01,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if they didn't mention anything about guitar mode coming back.

1131
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:05,355
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm wondering if they're going to do something special with that, if they're going to have band mode or something.

1132
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:06,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they just scrapped it.

1133
01:21:06,656 --> 01:21:06,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Outro Music

1134
01:21:28,827 --> 01:21:30,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's really cool.

1135
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:47,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so a lot more stuff.

1136
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:56,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also said, you know those samples that you trigger and stuff, how they really have the annoying Flava Flav samples and stuff like that?

1137
01:21:56,815 --> 01:22:00,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now the samples are going to be tying in with the songs instead.

1138
01:22:00,718 --> 01:22:02,259
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not going to be able to choose these different sample sets.

1139
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:02,780
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good.

1140
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,541
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw says I mispronounced the name of that other artist.

1141
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:06,462
[SPEAKER_14]: It's DeadMouse.

1142
01:22:06,602 --> 01:22:07,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's not my fault.

1143
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:09,204
[SPEAKER_14]: He has to type all week, speak, whatever.

1144
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:10,284
[SPEAKER_11]: He has an awesome mask.

1145
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently he's in the game.

1146
01:22:11,985 --> 01:22:12,906
[SPEAKER_11]: He has a giant mouse head.

1147
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:18,590
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some more like real dancey artists or real club artists like Pendulum.

1148
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:23,733
[SPEAKER_11]: They're supposed to be focusing it more on electronic artists this time.

1149
01:22:23,893 --> 01:22:24,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope so.

1150
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:24,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Pendulum?

1151
01:22:25,934 --> 01:22:28,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Pendulum would be awesome.

1152
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd buy the game day one more than I already will buy it day one.

1153
01:22:31,938 --> 01:22:33,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm buying it day one as it is.

1154
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:37,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though I don't play the first one, I still want to go back to it.

1155
01:22:37,321 --> 01:22:43,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm buying that day one and seeing it with Rock Band 3 with the keyboard because I totally want to play that.

1156
01:22:43,405 --> 01:22:54,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they'll improve the turntable at all because there were so many people that were having problems with buttons stop working and I have problems with the scratching doesn't always trigger.

1157
01:22:55,498 --> 01:22:57,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a little tricky sometimes.

1158
01:22:59,120 --> 01:22:59,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1159
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:05,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a, what was it, a beta controller and I also have a regular controller.

1160
01:23:06,203 --> 01:23:07,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a wired controller.

1161
01:23:08,061 --> 01:23:08,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1162
01:23:08,742 --> 01:23:12,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have the Wired360 one from the demo we had.

1163
01:23:12,345 --> 01:23:13,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1164
01:23:13,346 --> 01:23:13,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Demo controller.

1165
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:14,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1166
01:23:15,928 --> 01:23:16,629
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, folks.

1167
01:23:16,669 --> 01:23:22,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, believe it or not, before we get to the end of Part A, I have to break, guys, because we do have some special news.

1168
01:23:23,235 --> 01:23:23,695
All right.

1169
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:32,830
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

1170
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,231
[SPEAKER_14]: We break for this special news report here.

1171
01:23:35,351 --> 01:23:41,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, this comes to us thanks to Twitter, and Bobby sent this along and alerted me to what's going on here.

1172
01:23:41,834 --> 01:23:45,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, the event is starting to get underway, the whole kinetic event.

1173
01:23:46,275 --> 01:23:49,657
[SPEAKER_14]: They have forced the entire audience to wear ponchos.

1174
01:23:51,257 --> 01:23:55,118
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all in these metallic poncho-looking things.

1175
01:23:55,818 --> 01:24:01,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, the Xbox event will involve a splash zone or something.

1176
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:04,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the hell is going on.

1177
01:24:04,441 --> 01:24:07,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be they're hitting watermelons and talls.

1178
01:24:07,702 --> 01:24:09,282
[SPEAKER_14]: They're repeating this Monday night.

1179
01:24:10,343 --> 01:24:10,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing.

1180
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:14,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov and I actually had the opportunity to go to this event, but a day late.

1181
01:24:15,444 --> 01:24:18,266
[SPEAKER_14]: because they're redoing it tomorrow night and we were like, that's okay.

1182
01:24:19,447 --> 01:24:21,649
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I'm really feeling that was a good idea.

1183
01:24:21,809 --> 01:24:22,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I would.

1184
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:25,152
[SPEAKER_04]: That looks fun because I don't know.

1185
01:24:25,172 --> 01:24:27,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to get watermelon on me or something.

1186
01:24:27,114 --> 01:24:30,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you get to keep these little shoulder pad poncho things?

1187
01:24:30,436 --> 01:24:33,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody looks so happy in the pictures to be wearing them.

1188
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:36,962
[SPEAKER_14]: They're probably like, oh my God, I'm going to be a TV with this.

1189
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:41,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not even joking.

1190
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:42,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Bobby, post a link in chat.

1191
01:24:42,334 --> 01:24:42,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're listening.

1192
01:24:43,034 --> 01:24:43,555
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

1193
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:44,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Good stuff.

1194
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:46,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Big silver.

1195
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:49,862
[SPEAKER_14]: But if everybody in the audience is wearing that, it's gonna look weird on TV.

1196
01:24:51,377 --> 01:24:52,497
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I was thinking though?

1197
01:24:52,698 --> 01:24:57,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I was making the joke, I'm like, you know how these camera games just really suck and they don't work very well?

1198
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,380
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, is that what I need to wear?

1199
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's gonna come packaged in.

1200
01:25:01,521 --> 01:25:04,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know how they had like, what is it, the stupid jumpsuits and stuff?

1201
01:25:04,742 --> 01:25:10,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So, apparently the Kinect only works if you're wearing like a silly costume.

1202
01:25:11,184 --> 01:25:12,545
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all silly costumes only.

1203
01:25:14,747 --> 01:25:21,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we are getting to the end here of Part A on our show, but you know we cannot call it quits until we get to one more segment.

1204
01:25:21,912 --> 01:25:25,835
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to do this segment every week, because if we don't, DarkSakura finds me down and threatens to kill me.

1205
01:25:26,195 --> 01:25:27,055
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes she does.

1206
01:25:27,716 --> 01:25:28,597
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the Classic Game of the Week!

1207
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,164
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura's gonna dive into the vault and find a game she thinks you kids ought to be playing this week and respecting.

1208
01:25:39,624 --> 01:25:42,306
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1209
01:25:42,901 --> 01:25:45,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's classic game is Magician Lord.

1210
01:25:46,044 --> 01:25:50,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally walked into the vault and what's the first game I see?

1211
01:25:50,407 --> 01:25:51,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Magician Lord.

1212
01:25:51,368 --> 01:25:51,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1213
01:25:52,589 --> 01:25:53,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a Neo Geo game.

1214
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:58,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It was developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK.

1215
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:03,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a Neo Geo arcade in the home systems and a virtual console.

1216
01:26:03,518 --> 01:26:04,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out in 1994.

1217
01:26:06,491 --> 01:26:17,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is a platform game, and it actually was one of the pack-ins for the Neo Geo AES, so that's probably why I have a copy.

1218
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:23,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's about this wizard named Elta, who is the last magician lord going to save his homeland.

1219
01:26:24,894 --> 01:26:31,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go through and you get different spheres that will give you different abilities.

1220
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:33,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1221
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:41,993
[SPEAKER_02]: He can jump and shoot and climb and do all kinds of stuff and he, you know, those fire and he cosplays every time he gets a sphere.

1222
01:26:42,373 --> 01:26:44,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, he actually gets different abilities with each sphere.

1223
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,402
[SPEAKER_02]: He also walks really funny.

1224
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:51,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if he walks fast, he still looks like he's prancing, kind of.

1225
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:57,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just, like, he's climbing a ladder right now, but you just have to look at him walk.

1226
01:26:57,872 --> 01:26:58,052
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

1227
01:26:58,652 --> 01:27:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's in, never mind, he looks funny when he's in human form.

1228
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:05,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so he got, has a dragon warrior form.

1229
01:27:05,574 --> 01:27:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: He breathes fire, and it's a continuous short-range attack, and you can aim it diagonally.

1230
01:27:11,856 --> 01:27:18,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Waterman, where there's water grenades that are blue bubbles that explode into water pillars.

1231
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Which sounds kind of like Caterpillar, but not.

1232
01:27:23,902 --> 01:27:26,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's Poseidon, which is a more powerful Waterman.

1233
01:27:27,064 --> 01:27:30,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So he shoots waves of water and has a lot of damage.

1234
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:34,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And he can freeze enemies and shatter on impact.

1235
01:27:34,948 --> 01:27:36,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And moves very slowly.

1236
01:27:37,443 --> 01:27:44,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The Shinobi is more agile and has powerful magic arcs of fire.

1237
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:45,715
[SPEAKER_02]: They are wide but slow moving.

1238
01:27:45,835 --> 01:27:53,265
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the Samurai who can attack through barriers such as walls, shields, multiple enemies with a boomerang-like energy attack.

1239
01:27:53,906 --> 01:28:01,953
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Raijin, who gives Elta the ability to jump a lot better and has an electrical field around his body.

1240
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:06,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's because Raijin is an electric person.

1241
01:28:07,557 --> 01:28:08,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the game.

1242
01:28:08,738 --> 01:28:11,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that he just walks really funny.

1243
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of prancy funny.

1244
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:13,482
[SPEAKER_14]: He does.

1245
01:28:13,542 --> 01:28:14,462
[SPEAKER_14]: He prances a little bit.

1246
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:15,063
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of funny.

1247
01:28:15,103 --> 01:28:17,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I like his stylish blue hat.

1248
01:28:18,464 --> 01:28:20,125
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1249
01:28:45,205 --> 01:28:50,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we are going to take a break here at Orange Lounge Radio, but don't worry guys, we'll be right back with plenty more.

1250
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:54,713
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get to your phone calls tonight, of course, some rapid fire news, the mailbag, and all that good stuff we always do.

1251
01:28:55,333 --> 01:29:00,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Also tonight, I've been keeping it a secret, I want to do a little something special for you guys that are listening tonight.

1252
01:29:01,547 --> 01:29:02,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio

1253
01:29:35,646 --> 01:29:40,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this Sunday evening, June the 13th of 2010.

1254
01:29:41,932 --> 01:29:51,860
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had a lot of busy, busy E3 pre-news tonight and lots of breaking news and updates going on and all this stuff happening and will the madness never end?

1255
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:52,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course not!

1256
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,043
E3 Pre-News

1257
01:30:00,743 --> 01:30:02,684
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Tom Brokaw with a special report

1258
01:30:23,658 --> 01:30:31,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, it's Blizzard's own internal version of Steam slash X-Fire for their own games.

1259
01:30:31,481 --> 01:30:37,664
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can see, like, if you have friends that play WoW on different servers, you're going to be able to talk to them on those different servers and interact with them and so forth.

1260
01:30:38,064 --> 01:30:43,606
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's part of the catch that goes with that, is that you're going to have real names for friends.

1261
01:30:44,127 --> 01:30:51,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Your real ID friends will appear under their real-life names on your friends list when chatting, communicating in-game, or viewing a character's profile.

1262
01:30:52,410 --> 01:31:11,948
[SPEAKER_14]: real ID friends can also see who's on each other's real ID friends list making it easy for players to connect with other people they know I hate that I'm not going to use this I don't want people to know my full name I use a fake name here on the show I realize some people do but it's kind of one of those like you know I don't really like to advertise it I don't want to be found that easy

1263
01:31:12,808 --> 01:31:39,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine that they're going to force you to use your real name that there won't be some sort of option to use a fake name also maybe they'll go by what your account name whatever you put for that and I have used multiple accounts on WoW and I have used random names I think I had to use my real name I think I might have tried to put just my last initial and that's what I would like I don't care if it's my real last initial but I don't want somebody to google my name

1264
01:31:40,698 --> 01:31:42,141
[SPEAKER_14]: and find all my WoW characters.

1265
01:31:42,962 --> 01:31:44,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially with what I named some of them, okay?

1266
01:31:44,605 --> 01:31:47,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need my students at work doing that.

1267
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:48,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Sassy pants?

1268
01:31:48,772 --> 01:31:49,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure!

1269
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, I don't know, I'm just...

1270
01:31:54,252 --> 01:31:55,333
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of irritating.

1271
01:31:55,353 --> 01:31:57,195
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of irritating.

1272
01:31:57,215 --> 01:31:57,755
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of irritating.

1273
01:32:17,685 --> 01:32:19,986
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope that can be suppressed.

1274
01:32:20,146 --> 01:32:22,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope Blizzard is not that stupid.

1275
01:32:22,908 --> 01:32:26,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Blizzard, if you're listening, I hope you are not that stupid.

1276
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll make you pay $25 to change it.

1277
01:32:30,773 --> 01:32:31,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Will I get a pony with it?

1278
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:32,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

1279
01:32:33,135 --> 01:32:33,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a pet.

1280
01:32:34,915 --> 01:32:36,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, more breaking news.

1281
01:32:36,216 --> 01:32:37,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Will there be more breaking news throughout the show?

1282
01:32:38,118 --> 01:32:38,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1283
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:39,099
[SPEAKER_14]: It should have been a game.

1284
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:41,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, how many breaking news interruptions will there be tonight?

1285
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,081
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a crazy night.

1286
01:32:43,022 --> 01:32:45,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright guys, let's get back into some gaming news.

1287
01:32:45,464 --> 01:32:47,045
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do some quick stories here.

1288
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:49,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki and myself, Jamie's sitting out tonight because of her voice.

1289
01:32:49,727 --> 01:32:51,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, go ahead and let's get to some quick news.

1290
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:57,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Portal 2, just like the party that they were going to have for Portal 2.

1291
01:32:58,157 --> 01:32:58,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been delayed.

1292
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:01,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the party got canceled.

1293
01:33:01,802 --> 01:33:02,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Game delayed, though.

1294
01:33:03,064 --> 01:33:04,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Not coming out until 2011, and that's too bad.

1295
01:33:04,225 --> 01:33:04,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well.

1296
01:33:08,905 --> 01:33:17,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Game though that is coming out over here, also in 2011, which is kind of a surprise seeing as the last game hasn't sold very well at all.

1297
01:33:19,634 --> 01:33:25,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Yakuza 4 is slated to be heading to North America and Europe in Spring 2011.

1298
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:30,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully they do not cut out a ton of stuff like they did with Yakuza 3.

1299
01:33:30,083 --> 01:33:30,123
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1300
01:33:33,766 --> 01:33:41,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy 9 is making its way to PlayStation Network next week.

1301
01:33:43,588 --> 01:33:46,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, 9 was my least favorite on the PlayStation.

1302
01:33:46,649 --> 01:33:49,530
[SPEAKER_11]: But hey, if you still want to buy it, it's only going to be $10.

1303
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:53,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you forget about Final Fantasy 8?

1304
01:33:54,437 --> 01:33:55,298
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great game.

1305
01:33:55,678 --> 01:33:57,620
[SPEAKER_14]: A great game to make fun of.

1306
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:58,981
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked 8 better than 9.

1307
01:33:59,262 --> 01:34:00,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 9 is terrible.

1308
01:34:00,363 --> 01:34:01,684
[SPEAKER_14]: What is wrong with you people?

1309
01:34:02,705 --> 01:34:05,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Avivi was cool, and Quina was funny, and the game sucked.

1310
01:34:08,137 --> 01:34:09,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing a show with insane people.

1311
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:31,608
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't say when it's supposed to end.

1312
01:34:31,908 --> 01:34:33,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm guessing sometime next week.

1313
01:34:34,689 --> 01:34:36,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that's hours and not days.

1314
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:38,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1315
01:34:39,672 --> 01:34:42,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, during E3 would kind of be the time to do it.

1316
01:34:42,693 --> 01:34:44,614
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the Japanese site.

1317
01:34:45,315 --> 01:34:46,155
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting, though.

1318
01:34:46,175 --> 01:34:47,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's going to have online multiplayer.

1319
01:34:47,956 --> 01:34:53,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, if they're doing a beta test, it's probably going to have online multiplayer because they have to stress their servers, but

1320
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:54,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1321
01:34:55,346 --> 01:34:57,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really seeing anything on the countdown site.

1322
01:34:57,527 --> 01:35:11,538
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, if you want to check it out, it's www.jp.playstation.com S-C-E-J slash Marusen M-A-R-U-S-E-N It's down to 86, so it must be ours.

1323
01:35:11,899 --> 01:35:12,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's ours.

1324
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:16,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would probably be sometime this week during E3.

1325
01:35:16,942 --> 01:35:19,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps their press conference time?

1326
01:35:19,324 --> 01:35:19,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe?

1327
01:35:19,725 --> 01:35:19,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Around?

1328
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:20,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1329
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:21,466
[SPEAKER_14]: About three days?

1330
01:35:21,506 --> 01:35:21,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, maybe.

1331
01:35:22,367 --> 01:35:22,667
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

1332
01:35:23,598 --> 01:35:25,921
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, moving on to some other news.

1333
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:26,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Puzzle Quest.

1334
01:35:27,122 --> 01:35:28,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the news keeps coming on Puzzle Quest.

1335
01:35:29,004 --> 01:35:29,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, this is great.

1336
01:35:29,845 --> 01:35:34,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Chapters 1 and 2 are free on the iPhone right now.

1337
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:37,614
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you want to grab a free Puzzle Quest, you got to do it right now.

1338
01:35:37,974 --> 01:35:41,097
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how long this is available for, but I believe it's just the weekend.

1339
01:35:41,137 --> 01:35:45,102
[SPEAKER_14]: So unfortunately, those of you listening to the podcast Monday morning, this sale may already be over.

1340
01:35:45,442 --> 01:35:48,965
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, chapters 1 and 2 of Puzzle Quest, they split it up on the iPhone.

1341
01:35:49,505 --> 01:35:50,466
[SPEAKER_14]: It's free right now.

1342
01:35:50,867 --> 01:35:56,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Now if you actually get all the way to the third chapter, it's going to cost you $1.99 for the third chapter.

1343
01:35:57,252 --> 01:35:58,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it going to hold your attention that long?

1344
01:35:58,913 --> 01:36:00,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to the training dummy and then I stopped.

1345
01:36:01,764 --> 01:36:06,367
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, it's a little wonky on the iPhone because I did play that a little bit.

1346
01:36:06,707 --> 01:36:12,350
[SPEAKER_14]: And my problem with it on the iPhone is that it's just that my 3G is not built to play a game like that.

1347
01:36:12,491 --> 01:36:15,973
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be better on that new iPhone 4 or whatever's coming out in a couple weeks.

1348
01:36:15,993 --> 01:36:17,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a 3GS, so I'll see how it does on mine.

1349
01:36:18,014 --> 01:36:19,175
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll probably do a little better with yours.

1350
01:36:19,915 --> 01:36:20,996
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you think about the iPhone 4?

1351
01:36:22,677 --> 01:36:23,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks amazing.

1352
01:36:23,237 --> 01:36:25,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you really want to get in that discussion, Loki?

1353
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:25,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sure.

1354
01:36:26,799 --> 01:36:28,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get one, absolutely.

1355
01:36:28,899 --> 01:36:37,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm one of those people where my contract is up in October usually, so I get the whole retro deal or whatever from AT&T where I can't upgrade and it's coming out right in time for my birthday.

1356
01:36:37,923 --> 01:36:39,784
[SPEAKER_14]: But I need a faster phone.

1357
01:36:39,844 --> 01:36:44,245
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the apps are really hurting on the old phone and just for the technology to catch up.

1358
01:36:44,285 --> 01:36:46,226
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the idea of a front-facing camera.

1359
01:36:46,246 --> 01:36:47,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the video conferencing is going to be fun.

1360
01:36:48,847 --> 01:36:50,508
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be a fun little toy to have.

1361
01:36:50,528 --> 01:36:51,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1362
01:36:51,448 --> 01:36:54,271
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you think about the motion controllers or the new stuff?

1363
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:55,232
[SPEAKER_14]: With Gyroscope?

1364
01:36:55,412 --> 01:36:56,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to get Lair on it.

1365
01:36:56,834 --> 01:36:58,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm curious to see how it's going to be implemented.

1366
01:36:58,976 --> 01:37:03,381
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm a little worried, though, because I know I'm going to get these video phone calls from Miklatov.

1367
01:37:03,682 --> 01:37:05,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And Miklatov's going to call me on video.

1368
01:37:05,063 --> 01:37:07,166
[SPEAKER_14]: He's going to be like, look, my Pokemon evolved.

1369
01:37:07,826 --> 01:37:08,207
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I want...

1370
01:37:08,747 --> 01:37:11,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless it's adorable, will I do that?

1371
01:37:11,068 --> 01:37:11,829
[SPEAKER_14]: He'll totally do it.

1372
01:37:11,989 --> 01:37:13,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll only do it when I get black and white.

1373
01:37:13,389 --> 01:37:15,310
[SPEAKER_14]: And video editing on live.

1374
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:17,691
[SPEAKER_14]: The HD camera thing is pretty cool.

1375
01:37:18,131 --> 01:37:20,152
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually surprised you of all people asked this, Loki.

1376
01:37:21,093 --> 01:37:22,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you interested in this photo?

1377
01:37:22,453 --> 01:37:27,936
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was watching the live blog because there was really nothing going on this week.

1378
01:37:28,516 --> 01:37:31,218
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was kind of like my...

1379
01:37:33,499 --> 01:37:38,724
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess preparation for the live blogs and conferences and stuff like that that are coming this week.

1380
01:37:39,224 --> 01:37:40,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of the prep course.

1381
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:41,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

1382
01:37:42,127 --> 01:37:45,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I just stopped listening to this show because Bobby sent me a link here on Twitter.

1383
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:46,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Another twit pic.

1384
01:37:46,531 --> 01:37:49,474
[SPEAKER_14]: That is Itagaki in a space poncho.

1385
01:37:50,134 --> 01:37:52,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I need a LiveJournal icon of this immediately.

1386
01:37:52,877 --> 01:37:53,998
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, can you help?

1387
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,361
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Itagaki in the space poncho.

1388
01:37:57,581 --> 01:37:58,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Send it to me.

1389
01:37:58,562 --> 01:38:13,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Poncho Itagaki That's all you need I love it, he's kind of looking up like Behold, the future is in my poncho Oh, this is great I'm sorry, I'm having to distract Shane for a moment

1390
01:38:14,437 --> 01:38:18,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps we can... I had to show him my favorite car ever.

1391
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is genius.

1392
01:38:19,781 --> 01:38:21,963
[SPEAKER_14]: They're getting all these celebrities to put on space ponchos.

1393
01:38:21,983 --> 01:38:22,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at this.

1394
01:38:22,323 --> 01:38:22,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at this.

1395
01:38:22,643 --> 01:38:24,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Felicia Day in a space poncho.

1396
01:38:24,084 --> 01:38:24,504
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1397
01:38:24,544 --> 01:38:25,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me the Itagaki.

1398
01:38:25,885 --> 01:38:26,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make you... I just did.

1399
01:38:26,926 --> 01:38:28,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Check your private message.

1400
01:38:28,147 --> 01:38:31,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make one of him in the ponchos as space rock star.

1401
01:38:31,589 --> 01:38:35,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you want to know something or kind of a funny game we should play?

1402
01:38:36,433 --> 01:38:39,795
[SPEAKER_11]: How much will these space ponchos go for on eBay?

1403
01:38:40,356 --> 01:38:41,777
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they're covered in watermelon.

1404
01:38:44,577 --> 01:38:48,598
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it's probably just going to be some sort of light showing or reflect off the space poncho.

1405
01:38:48,618 --> 01:38:52,199
[SPEAKER_14]: They better, like, make you turn those in on the way out because they have another show tomorrow night.

1406
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,320
[SPEAKER_14]: We could have worn the space ponchos.

1407
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:56,261
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you don't go to work, we still can.

1408
01:38:56,281 --> 01:38:57,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have laughed at you.

1409
01:38:58,802 --> 01:39:00,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have been like, we could take this.

1410
01:39:00,382 --> 01:39:00,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We could take this.

1411
01:39:01,122 --> 01:39:02,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha ha ha ha.

1412
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:03,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha.

1413
01:39:03,643 --> 01:39:06,645
[SPEAKER_04]: We could take emo pictures like the first few people that had them.

1414
01:39:07,005 --> 01:39:08,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Ditch work or space poncho.

1415
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:11,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Ditch work or space poncho.

1416
01:39:12,388 --> 01:39:14,169
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a tough call.

1417
01:39:14,189 --> 01:39:15,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Those would be the same thing.

1418
01:39:15,970 --> 01:39:17,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Work or space poncho.

1419
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:24,475
[SPEAKER_11]: The only way that this could possibly be cooler is if they had Conan O'Brien there and he just starts doing...

1420
01:39:25,095 --> 01:39:25,916
[SPEAKER_11]: In the year 2000!

1421
01:39:26,136 --> 01:39:29,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that would be awesome.

1422
01:39:29,959 --> 01:39:34,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they're branded at all, and if they don't make you turn them in, they could probably go for a lot on eBay.

1423
01:39:34,463 --> 01:39:36,405
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably like the glasses after Captain EO.

1424
01:39:36,425 --> 01:39:41,449
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be a large man standing there making you deposit them in the bin, or he will ref you up.

1425
01:39:41,549 --> 01:39:42,050
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that?

1426
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:43,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Captain EO at Disneyland?

1427
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:45,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience thing?

1428
01:39:46,233 --> 01:39:47,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing was weird.

1429
01:39:47,234 --> 01:39:51,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, imagine that with an 80s movie starring Michael Jackson.

1430
01:39:52,058 --> 01:39:53,499
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the greatest motion picture ever made.

1431
01:39:53,859 --> 01:39:55,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe that for a second.

1432
01:39:56,721 --> 01:39:57,342
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming back.

1433
01:39:57,842 --> 01:39:58,242
[SPEAKER_14]: It's there.

1434
01:39:58,543 --> 01:39:59,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw it a couple weeks ago.

1435
01:39:59,583 --> 01:40:00,044
[SPEAKER_14]: It's amazing.

1436
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:04,323
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought it back after Michael Jackson kicked it.

1437
01:40:04,984 --> 01:40:05,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1438
01:40:06,005 --> 01:40:07,066
[SPEAKER_11]: After he beat it?

1439
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:11,691
[SPEAKER_11]: After they realized that Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, wait, we haven't done that in a long time.

1440
01:40:11,812 --> 01:40:17,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that the Honey, I Shrunk the Audience was pretty fun because it had Eric Idle in it.

1441
01:40:18,103 --> 01:40:29,570
[SPEAKER_14]: BobbyBlackWolf in our chatroom Bobby is pointing out Usually you can keep stuff from MS Press conferences I still have the ass cushion they gave us in 2007 It's in my garage What was that used for?

1442
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:41,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I noticed 360 gives you hemorrhoids Well, if that's the same There was the one that was This 360 is so great, my anus is flaring

1443
01:40:41,838 --> 01:40:48,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the 360 dealie where they had us with the headphones.

1444
01:40:50,035 --> 01:40:51,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't let us keep the headphones, but they were expensive.

1445
01:40:53,666 --> 01:40:57,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these are from the future, these space ponchos, so they might be expensive too.

1446
01:40:57,388 --> 01:41:02,211
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I called in sick to work tomorrow, I might get in trouble and get a write-up, but I would get a space poncho.

1447
01:41:02,451 --> 01:41:03,452
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be worth it.

1448
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:05,273
[SPEAKER_14]: But see, here's the sick thing.

1449
01:41:05,433 --> 01:41:12,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think I have a couple co-workers who listen to this show now, and the bad thing is I'm actually legitimately getting sick.

1450
01:41:12,597 --> 01:41:15,919
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I do call in to work tomorrow, it's not for space poncho, it's because I'm sick.

1451
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:21,143
[SPEAKER_14]: But now they're going to go around telling people, oh, if you listen to Rob's show, he called in sick because he wants to go get a space poncho.

1452
01:41:22,003 --> 01:41:22,823
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they'll understand.

1453
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:23,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fucked either way.

1454
01:41:26,845 --> 01:41:28,406
[SPEAKER_14]: No, actually, my coworkers are pretty cool.

1455
01:41:29,186 --> 01:41:32,128
[SPEAKER_14]: They'd be like, as long as you wear it to work.

1456
01:41:32,428 --> 01:41:37,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of my coworkers are like, you do a radio show?

1457
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if I could wear that to work.

1458
01:41:40,451 --> 01:41:41,492
[SPEAKER_04]: A space poncho?

1459
01:41:41,552 --> 01:41:42,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1460
01:41:42,752 --> 01:41:44,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worn Santa hats before.

1461
01:41:44,793 --> 01:41:46,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't see how that's any different.

1462
01:41:46,894 --> 01:41:49,956
[SPEAKER_14]: You should just come back from LA and show up to work on your space poncho.

1463
01:41:49,976 --> 01:41:57,021
[SPEAKER_11]: What you need to do is you need to go around E3 gathering parts to this grand costume that you will wear through E3.

1464
01:41:57,181 --> 01:42:01,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's going to be mostly lanyards probably.

1465
01:42:02,044 --> 01:42:03,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Lanyards and space ponchos.

1466
01:42:04,005 --> 01:42:07,888
[SPEAKER_14]: BlackWolfInChat says, I've never heard that they're doing this event again though, but we have an invite.

1467
01:42:07,908 --> 01:42:09,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we have tickets for tomorrow.

1468
01:42:10,049 --> 01:42:11,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but we're just not going.

1469
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:12,171
[SPEAKER_14]: But now I kind of want to.

1470
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:14,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go grab a space poncho and leave.

1471
01:42:15,173 --> 01:42:15,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, that's a good idea.

1472
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:18,240
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what it is.

1473
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:20,002
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a repeat for fans or something, right?

1474
01:42:20,022 --> 01:42:23,506
[SPEAKER_14]: It was going to be a higher Cirque du Soleil and the blackout on TV is until Tuesday.

1475
01:42:23,546 --> 01:42:24,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's a reason for it.

1476
01:42:24,387 --> 01:42:26,089
[SPEAKER_14]: They're probably doing fans tomorrow or something.

1477
01:42:26,383 --> 01:42:35,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was something through, I guess, the campus that they're holding it on, and they were giving away tickets to the public, and we scored a couple.

1478
01:42:36,429 --> 01:42:36,889
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

1479
01:42:37,289 --> 01:42:37,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Space poncho.

1480
01:42:38,310 --> 01:42:38,590
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1481
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:42,672
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, we were supposed to be doing news, and Black Wolf says, are you sure it's tomorrow?

1482
01:42:42,772 --> 01:42:46,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a hundred times, because this is the same question Rob asked me.

1483
01:42:47,555 --> 01:42:49,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I put him through the whole interrogation too.

1484
01:42:49,676 --> 01:42:52,516
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, okay, well, are you sure it's not Sunday?

1485
01:42:53,377 --> 01:42:56,938
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, it's Monday at the same place, so it's not the press conference.

1486
01:42:56,958 --> 01:43:00,439
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the same place, and it's called the Natal reveal or whatever.

1487
01:43:00,559 --> 01:43:06,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's not, I'm sure I would have gotten a text about it now saying, oh, crap, you guys, it's tonight, not tomorrow.

1488
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

1489
01:43:08,201 --> 01:43:11,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know what that's all about, but they're doing it.

1490
01:43:12,782 --> 01:43:14,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf's like, are you sure?

1491
01:43:14,664 --> 01:43:15,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I saw that.

1492
01:43:15,905 --> 01:43:22,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm as sure as I can be without actually being there and seeing the tickets, but my contact, you know, I trust.

1493
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:25,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Nikolatov in a space poncho says, yes, it's true.

1494
01:43:25,751 --> 01:43:26,412
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, anyway.

1495
01:43:27,312 --> 01:43:28,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you're positive?

1496
01:43:28,573 --> 01:43:29,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, come on, let's move on.

1497
01:43:30,214 --> 01:43:31,195
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, other stuff.

1498
01:43:31,235 --> 01:43:33,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Civilization V has a release date.

1499
01:43:33,156 --> 01:43:33,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

1500
01:43:34,197 --> 01:43:36,979
[SPEAKER_14]: September 21st is when Civ V is coming out in North America.

1501
01:43:37,079 --> 01:43:41,261
[SPEAKER_14]: 24th is when it will come out internationally, which means it will be pirated internationally on the 21st.

1502
01:43:43,503 --> 01:43:46,266
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the civilization that has hexagons in it, basically.

1503
01:43:46,306 --> 01:43:48,068
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be more information at E3 next week.

1504
01:43:48,108 --> 01:43:50,951
[SPEAKER_14]: You know I'm going to be checking this out because I loves me some civilization.

1505
01:43:52,119 --> 01:43:55,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Duke Nukem Manhattan Project is real.

1506
01:43:55,922 --> 01:43:58,964
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming to Xbox Live for $10 on June 23rd.

1507
01:43:59,004 --> 01:44:00,585
[SPEAKER_14]: A little trailer hit the internet this week.

1508
01:44:01,225 --> 01:44:04,087
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe, what, this is a 2D game, right?

1509
01:44:04,167 --> 01:44:06,129
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is actually kind of retro graphics.

1510
01:44:06,389 --> 01:44:09,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's 3D, but it's a 2D side-scroller action game.

1511
01:44:09,591 --> 01:44:11,893
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of where the 2D games are going these days, right?

1512
01:44:11,913 --> 01:44:15,235
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a beat-em-up.

1513
01:44:15,295 --> 01:44:17,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to get your match this time, Nukem World.

1514
01:44:18,397 --> 01:44:20,098
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cool, but it's not Duke Nukem Forever.

1515
01:44:20,759 --> 01:44:24,081
[SPEAKER_14]: That's still kind of neat, because if you remember, Duke Nukem's roots were a 2D game.

1516
01:44:24,101 --> 01:44:25,162
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of people forget that.

1517
01:44:25,202 --> 01:44:26,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Duke Nukem was a 2D game first.

1518
01:44:27,203 --> 01:44:28,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's my Halloween Harry remake?

1519
01:44:29,645 --> 01:44:31,346
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good day to die.

1520
01:44:33,067 --> 01:44:34,048
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, good stuff.

1521
01:44:34,068 --> 01:44:37,430
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember, and since this isn't our show role, I'll talk about it.

1522
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:47,797
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember there was a lawsuit filed against the people working on Duke Nukem Forever because they took too damn long, and that's been settled.

1523
01:44:48,277 --> 01:44:50,978
[SPEAKER_11]: and perhaps Duke Nukem News in the future, maybe?

1524
01:44:52,158 --> 01:44:52,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't know.

1525
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:56,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually... I don't know if we can get into that later.

1526
01:44:56,319 --> 01:44:56,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Never mind.

1527
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:58,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, no, no, we're not.

1528
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:03,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, one other thing, kind of going back to when we were talking about Rock Band 3.

1529
01:45:05,002 --> 01:45:15,449
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also, remember, a lawsuit against MTV Games and Harmonix for Rock Band from Gibson.

1530
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:19,992
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's been settled because you know who's making the Super Pro guitar controller?

1531
01:45:20,593 --> 01:45:21,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Gibson.

1532
01:45:24,557 --> 01:45:25,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a random game.

1533
01:45:25,798 --> 01:45:29,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Super Dimension Game Neptune apparently is a new game coming out.

1534
01:45:29,179 --> 01:45:30,520
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a Japanese role-playing game.

1535
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,861
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about game consoles who transform into anime girls.

1536
01:45:34,641 --> 01:45:35,662
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not making this up.

1537
01:45:36,202 --> 01:45:40,084
[SPEAKER_14]: It stars such people as Purple Heart, Green Heart, White Heart, and Black Heart.

1538
01:45:40,124 --> 01:45:41,624
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so imaginative.

1539
01:45:42,304 --> 01:45:46,626
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to fight Magikon, which I guess is the villain in the game.

1540
01:45:47,046 --> 01:45:50,428
[SPEAKER_14]: It's basically like an R4 device type thing.

1541
01:45:50,908 --> 01:45:53,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's Nippon Ichi who does Disgaea.

1542
01:45:53,370 --> 01:45:54,131
[SPEAKER_14]: They are part of this.

1543
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:55,392
[SPEAKER_14]: So is Compile Heart.

1544
01:45:55,752 --> 01:45:57,174
[SPEAKER_14]: They do Agarest Reward.

1545
01:45:58,115 --> 01:45:59,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of interesting things there.

1546
01:45:59,516 --> 01:46:02,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, classic Sega characters are supposed to show up in the game.

1547
01:46:02,819 --> 01:46:07,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Harrier, Altered Beast, Alex Kidd are like the summons in this game from the Nettoons.

1548
01:46:08,083 --> 01:46:08,564
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

1549
01:46:08,824 --> 01:46:09,925
[SPEAKER_14]: And apparently, here's the thing.

1550
01:46:10,045 --> 01:46:10,565
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this.

1551
01:46:10,646 --> 01:46:13,348
[SPEAKER_14]: You can also use images from your PlayStation 3 photo library.

1552
01:46:13,368 --> 01:46:13,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm getting this.

1553
01:46:13,948 --> 01:46:16,991
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a PS3 exclusive, which means region-free, kids.

1554
01:46:17,211 --> 01:46:17,692
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm getting this.

1555
01:46:18,132 --> 01:46:18,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds pretty awesome.

1556
01:46:18,893 --> 01:46:21,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't the Neptune a codename for one of the Sega systems anyways?

1557
01:46:22,797 --> 01:46:23,618
[SPEAKER_11]: That's kind of ironic.

1558
01:46:23,658 --> 01:46:24,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was.

1559
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:29,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Dreamcast's codename.

1560
01:46:32,106 --> 01:46:33,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Marissa Congusto in chat.

1561
01:46:33,327 --> 01:46:33,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Marissa.

1562
01:46:34,268 --> 01:46:36,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Says Gibson, referring to the earlier story.

1563
01:46:36,631 --> 01:46:39,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Gibson, does that mean it's going to be insanely expensive and elitist?

1564
01:46:40,214 --> 01:46:40,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1565
01:46:41,335 --> 01:46:41,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1566
01:46:42,895 --> 01:46:44,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Big announcements out of one studio here locally, right?

1567
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:57,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Telltale Games has announced that they're going to be doing some more episodic games.

1568
01:46:58,084 --> 01:47:02,266
[SPEAKER_11]: One franchise they are now going to be creating games for is Jurassic Park.

1569
01:47:02,806 --> 01:47:14,193
[SPEAKER_11]: They have struck a deal with NBCUniversal to develop games based on the MediaGiant's properties and Michael Crichton's Dinosaurs in Modern Day franchise being the first to get the interactive treatment.

1570
01:47:15,465 --> 01:47:21,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if since they've striked a deal with NBCUniversal, if we'll get an office game or something like that.

1571
01:47:22,032 --> 01:47:24,094
[SPEAKER_04]: An episodic office thing?

1572
01:47:24,174 --> 01:47:25,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really like this music a lot.

1573
01:47:25,955 --> 01:47:31,521
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the music in Jurassic Park, which is great because it's such a terrorist movie.

1574
01:47:31,641 --> 01:47:35,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Not actually about terrorists, but those dinosaurs rip people in half.

1575
01:47:35,605 --> 01:47:36,506
[SPEAKER_14]: And listen to the music.

1576
01:47:39,963 --> 01:47:41,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you ever read the book?

1577
01:47:41,724 --> 01:47:42,064
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

1578
01:47:42,304 --> 01:47:44,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, believe it or not, I read the original Jurassic Park book.

1579
01:47:44,325 --> 01:47:45,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you read The Lost World?

1580
01:47:45,385 --> 01:47:47,446
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not read The Lost World, but I did see the movie.

1581
01:47:47,526 --> 01:47:50,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I thought it was weird that he made a book sequel to a movie.

1582
01:47:50,727 --> 01:47:52,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Because, like, different characters died in the original book.

1583
01:47:53,008 --> 01:47:53,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1584
01:47:53,488 --> 01:47:56,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, everybody died in the original book.

1585
01:47:56,449 --> 01:47:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, my favorite character in the book died, and then he's suddenly back.

1586
01:48:00,631 --> 01:48:02,251
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a six-month thing on spoilers.

1587
01:48:02,271 --> 01:48:03,392
[SPEAKER_14]: After six months, it's okay.

1588
01:48:03,412 --> 01:48:05,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, how long ago was that book written?

1589
01:48:05,792 --> 01:48:06,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, in the 80s?

1590
01:48:06,173 --> 01:48:06,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1591
01:48:09,161 --> 01:48:12,482
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a very interesting franchise to bring back, don't you think?

1592
01:48:12,502 --> 01:48:18,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they should do more movies, to be honest, because, granted, the third movie sucked, but, hey, we're past that now.

1593
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:21,925
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been countless number of years, well, not countless, but a lot of years.

1594
01:48:21,965 --> 01:48:24,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't the fourth one kind of, like, held up in the works for a while?

1595
01:48:24,426 --> 01:48:35,510
[SPEAKER_11]: But they should have, I mean, they had the whole thing where, oh, the ship, you know, was on autopilot and landed on the mainland or whatever, and there's dinosaurs in there, and maybe some of them escaped, and now they're breeding.

1596
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:38,651
[SPEAKER_11]: That would make an interesting story, you know, dinosaurs on the mainland.

1597
01:48:40,249 --> 01:48:42,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Jurassic Park was actually kind of an awesome movie.

1598
01:48:42,771 --> 01:48:51,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember when it first came out, a lot of people didn't like it, but kids our age at that time, which had been teenagers and stuff... I had my birthday party centered around it when it came out, and we didn't see it.

1599
01:48:52,235 --> 01:48:53,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me tell you how long ago this movie came out.

1600
01:48:54,015 --> 01:48:54,596
[SPEAKER_14]: You ready?

1601
01:48:55,116 --> 01:48:57,377
[SPEAKER_14]: I went to the dollar movies with my girlfriend.

1602
01:48:57,737 --> 01:48:59,098
[SPEAKER_14]: to see Jurassic Park.

1603
01:48:59,218 --> 01:49:01,299
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had to hold her hand because she was so scared.

1604
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:07,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember when the dinosaur is looking through like that diner door thing at one of the little girls and he snorts?

1605
01:49:07,241 --> 01:49:09,222
[SPEAKER_14]: He snorts like she screamed.

1606
01:49:09,462 --> 01:49:10,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so funny.

1607
01:49:10,202 --> 01:49:10,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1608
01:49:10,603 --> 01:49:11,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Is she afraid of snorting?

1609
01:49:11,763 --> 01:49:14,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think she's afraid of killer dinosaurs that will rip her in half.

1610
01:49:14,784 --> 01:49:17,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Because remember the dinosaur like ate that guy in the toilet?

1611
01:49:17,766 --> 01:49:18,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Sitting on the toilet.

1612
01:49:19,006 --> 01:49:20,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Sitting on the toilet.

1613
01:49:20,627 --> 01:49:20,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Rah!

1614
01:49:21,328 --> 01:49:31,203
[SPEAKER_11]: another universal movie property that's going to get the game treatment as well and that's so awesome Back to the Future is getting some episodic games as well

1615
01:49:33,308 --> 01:49:34,408
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of awesome, too.

1616
01:49:35,109 --> 01:49:36,389
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell, Telltale?

1617
01:49:36,769 --> 01:49:38,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean that in a good way.

1618
01:49:38,790 --> 01:49:40,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Where the hell did this come from?

1619
01:49:42,190 --> 01:49:53,234
[SPEAKER_14]: All them nerds at Telltale, and I say that in the most loving, endearing way, all them nerds at Telltale must have been sitting in the boardroom one day going, all right, what fucking nerdy, awesome things should we bring back?

1620
01:49:54,034 --> 01:49:55,674
[SPEAKER_14]: And somebody was like, back to the future.

1621
01:49:55,734 --> 01:49:56,795
[SPEAKER_14]: And somebody else said, fuck yeah.

1622
01:49:57,335 --> 01:49:57,835
[SPEAKER_14]: And there it was.

1623
01:49:58,895 --> 01:49:59,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's Day of the Tentacle?

1624
01:50:00,516 --> 01:50:01,716
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more Day of the Tentacle.

1625
01:50:03,089 --> 01:50:06,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Back to the Future, wasn't that actually a point-and-click game back in the day?

1626
01:50:06,831 --> 01:50:09,593
[SPEAKER_14]: I seem to recall there was a LucasArts Back to the Future game.

1627
01:50:09,813 --> 01:50:10,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

1628
01:50:10,734 --> 01:50:12,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it have been LucasArts?

1629
01:50:13,335 --> 01:50:18,098
[SPEAKER_11]: No, there was some side-scrolling games on the NES that really sucked.

1630
01:50:18,659 --> 01:50:20,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, the first one was alright.

1631
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,461
[SPEAKER_11]: The second one, Back to the Future 2 and 3, was terrible.

1632
01:50:25,495 --> 01:50:27,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Jurassic Park also had video games.

1633
01:50:27,916 --> 01:50:29,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Jurassic Park games were awesome.

1634
01:50:29,117 --> 01:50:30,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they were really fun.

1635
01:50:30,217 --> 01:50:32,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought the Super Nintendo one was scary as fuck.

1636
01:50:32,938 --> 01:50:38,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked playing the arcade one where you sit in because I've several times found that machine on accidental replay.

1637
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:39,301
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was fun.

1638
01:50:39,361 --> 01:50:40,862
[SPEAKER_11]: All the Jurassic Park games are pretty awesome.

1639
01:50:40,882 --> 01:50:42,043
[SPEAKER_11]: The arcade one was sweet.

1640
01:50:42,103 --> 01:50:46,925
[SPEAKER_11]: The Super Nintendo one, which is kind of top-down, they went to almost a Wolfenstein mode.

1641
01:50:47,325 --> 01:50:49,846
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the Genesis one where you play as a dinosaur.

1642
01:50:49,866 --> 01:50:51,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was cool.

1643
01:50:52,187 --> 01:51:19,695
[SPEAKER_14]: that was awesome I love the Super Nintendo one with that whole first person shooter thing and then like the dinosaurs would just jump out of nowhere like RARF although because the Super Nintendo's capability was so limited you had like this little tiny goggles thing on the screen to see it was it was kind of sad but it used surround sound it was one of the first games that had surround sound in it although I was too poor for that I thought it was awesome that it was surround sound on is it pro logic I guess because you know it only had stereo output

1644
01:51:19,856 --> 01:51:21,790
[SPEAKER_14]: it was one of their old old old old ones

1645
01:51:22,148 --> 01:51:35,393
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it was simulated cue sound or whatever, but it was an old version of... It must have been Prologic, because that's the only... But obviously, now it's coming from Telltale, it's probably going to be more of a point-and-click game, so it'll be nothing like any of those games.

1646
01:51:35,413 --> 01:51:40,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I do believe it was Prologic, because I remember running it through our receiver.

1647
01:51:42,816 --> 01:51:43,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Good time.

1648
01:51:43,076 --> 01:51:46,017
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the Back to the Future game, there's going to be a lot of love for that.

1649
01:51:46,037 --> 01:51:47,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty excited about that.

1650
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:50,059
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me last night, and he was looking pretty giddy.

1651
01:51:51,178 --> 01:51:56,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, you need to get Christopher Lloyd in and record a bunch of voice work because that guy is not getting any younger.

1652
01:51:57,766 --> 01:51:58,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Good idea.

1653
01:51:58,507 --> 01:52:00,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Same, you know, with Michael J. Fox, too.

1654
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:03,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Get him in there in the studio because he is not getting any younger.

1655
01:52:04,707 --> 01:52:05,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some trivia for you.

1656
01:52:07,128 --> 01:52:18,550
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, for a while, a Back to the Future pinball table, and if you look at it, Michael J. Fox's face is not on it because he would not lend his likeness to make the pinball table.

1657
01:52:18,710 --> 01:52:19,050
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

1658
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:21,071
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like what happened with Paul Abdul in that American Idol game.

1659
01:52:21,111 --> 01:52:23,071
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know who was supposed to play him before?

1660
01:52:23,151 --> 01:52:24,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't it Jason Bateman?

1661
01:52:25,112 --> 01:52:28,213
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was Eric Roberts or something like that.

1662
01:52:28,273 --> 01:52:28,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget.

1663
01:52:29,173 --> 01:52:29,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I forget.

1664
01:52:30,222 --> 01:52:32,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, Jason Bateman played the sequel, Teen Wolf.

1665
01:52:33,045 --> 01:52:33,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

1666
01:52:35,126 --> 01:52:35,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Teen Wolf 2.

1667
01:52:36,347 --> 01:52:38,930
[SPEAKER_11]: And Teen Wolf the TV series coming to MTV.

1668
01:52:40,451 --> 01:52:40,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Awful.

1669
01:52:41,132 --> 01:52:46,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of awesome sounding games coming out soon, there is a Spongebob Squarepants MMO.

1670
01:52:48,078 --> 01:52:49,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Shoot me in the head.

1671
01:52:49,299 --> 01:52:50,360
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's awesome.

1672
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:51,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my reply to that.

1673
01:52:55,089 --> 01:52:57,411
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you have against Spongebob Squarepants?

1674
01:52:57,611 --> 01:52:58,011
[SPEAKER_14]: All of you.

1675
01:52:58,092 --> 01:52:59,233
[SPEAKER_14]: What is your problem with Spongebob Squarepants?

1676
01:52:59,253 --> 01:52:59,593
[SPEAKER_14]: It's dumb.

1677
01:52:59,693 --> 01:53:01,574
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested in mental retardation.

1678
01:53:02,555 --> 01:53:03,436
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a problem with it.

1679
01:53:03,456 --> 01:53:04,197
[SPEAKER_14]: The show's okay.

1680
01:53:04,637 --> 01:53:05,478
[SPEAKER_11]: It just grows on you.

1681
01:53:05,598 --> 01:53:12,704
[SPEAKER_14]: When I flew to New York once, I watched Spongebob Squarepants the entire way, and it went a little something like this.

1682
01:53:16,407 --> 01:53:18,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye, aye, Captain!

1683
01:53:18,228 --> 01:53:19,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't hear you!

1684
01:53:19,469 --> 01:53:19,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye, aye!

1685
01:53:34,446 --> 01:53:41,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Spongebob Squarepants belongs to that whole time frame of Nickelodeon kid shows that were actually awful.

1686
01:53:42,469 --> 01:53:43,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut your mouth.

1687
01:53:44,190 --> 01:53:47,251
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be coming out in 2011, but here's the thing.

1688
01:53:47,291 --> 01:53:51,393
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming out for China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and India.

1689
01:53:52,426 --> 01:53:57,467
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us since y'all are hatin' on Spongebob?

1690
01:54:15,734 --> 01:54:18,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something cool, actually cool, kind of.

1691
01:54:19,655 --> 01:54:28,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Street Fighter 4 might be having... Well, actually, there might be a motion-sensing Street Fighter game in the works.

1692
01:54:29,037 --> 01:54:43,240
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually Yoshinori Ono, who's the producer of Street Fighter 4, was saying that it could actually happen, that he was interested in motion-sensing ever since the Wii was launched, but he didn't think that Street Fighter...

1693
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:44,640
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1694
01:55:06,087 --> 01:55:11,673
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, I don't know, I'm worried it's going to be in that same bin as like, what was it, Virtual Street Fighter?

1695
01:55:11,713 --> 01:55:12,594
[SPEAKER_14]: What was it, Street Fighter EX?

1696
01:55:12,694 --> 01:55:13,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that what it was called?

1697
01:55:13,775 --> 01:55:14,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Street Fighter EX.

1698
01:55:14,516 --> 01:55:15,998
[SPEAKER_14]: That really terrible Street Fighter game.

1699
01:55:16,038 --> 01:55:17,399
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really bad, you guys.

1700
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:18,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Really bad.

1701
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,322
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually liked EX too.

1702
01:55:20,783 --> 01:55:21,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1703
01:55:21,604 --> 01:55:24,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I actually, I managed to get it to run on a 486.

1704
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:24,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1705
01:55:24,847 --> 01:55:27,851
[SPEAKER_02]: The first EX, sorry.

1706
01:55:28,942 --> 01:55:29,682
[SPEAKER_11]: That's old school.

1707
01:55:29,902 --> 01:55:30,942
[SPEAKER_11]: We have breaking news, Rob.

1708
01:55:31,803 --> 01:55:32,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we really?

1709
01:55:32,423 --> 01:55:32,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1710
01:55:32,883 --> 01:55:34,463
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep closing the theme song, though.

1711
01:55:34,483 --> 01:55:35,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not ready.

1712
01:55:35,123 --> 01:55:37,364
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to warn me when you're going to have breaking news.

1713
01:55:37,384 --> 01:55:38,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I just did.

1714
01:55:39,584 --> 01:55:40,544
[SPEAKER_11]: I gave you warnings.

1715
01:55:41,565 --> 01:55:42,185
[SPEAKER_11]: A few seconds.

1716
01:55:43,505 --> 01:55:43,825
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1717
01:55:43,845 --> 01:55:44,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hold on.

1718
01:55:44,325 --> 01:55:47,066
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to wake up the orchestra and get them to warm up.

1719
01:55:47,126 --> 01:55:47,406
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1720
01:55:47,426 --> 01:55:48,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go, guys.

1721
01:55:48,346 --> 01:55:49,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Breaking news.

1722
01:55:49,406 --> 01:55:50,126
Breaking news.

1723
01:55:59,332 --> 01:56:05,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming from a credible source, according to IGN, Retro Studios is creating a Donkey Kong title.

1724
01:56:05,838 --> 01:56:10,622
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, the folks behind Metroid Prime are making a Donkey Kong game.

1725
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:12,324
[SPEAKER_11]: That's gonna be weird.

1726
01:56:12,944 --> 01:56:13,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1727
01:56:13,565 --> 01:56:15,046
[SPEAKER_04]: First person Donkey Kong.

1728
01:56:15,807 --> 01:56:18,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that could be interesting.

1729
01:56:18,289 --> 01:56:19,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how I feel about that.

1730
01:56:19,971 --> 01:56:21,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have to play it with the bongo drums?

1731
01:56:22,313 --> 01:56:23,374
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no bongo drums.

1732
01:56:23,734 --> 01:56:24,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Donkey Konga?

1733
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:25,991
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1734
01:56:49,853 --> 01:56:53,619
[SPEAKER_11]: People start acting goofy when they're wearing space ponchos.

1735
01:56:53,739 --> 01:56:54,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is crazy.

1736
01:56:55,562 --> 01:56:57,546
[SPEAKER_11]: I just heard that.

1737
01:56:57,566 --> 01:56:59,649
[SPEAKER_11]: You should see the Donkey Kong game we're making.

1738
01:56:59,669 --> 01:57:00,370
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up with that?

1739
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:02,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick an executive, take him out for drinks.

1740
01:57:03,135 --> 01:57:03,796
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1741
01:57:05,495 --> 01:57:05,835
[SPEAKER_14]: XBOX Live

1742
01:57:25,157 --> 01:57:29,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Arcade as digital downloads in celebration of the 11th anniversary of the Dreamcast.

1743
01:57:30,199 --> 01:57:31,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's convenient timing if you ask me.

1744
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:37,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently one of the first games coming out will be Sonic Adventure.

1745
01:57:37,681 --> 01:57:41,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Also Crazy Taxi is confirmed to be coming as well.

1746
01:57:42,923 --> 01:57:44,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic Adventure I know is definitely out.

1747
01:57:44,584 --> 01:57:45,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Crazy Taxi!

1748
01:57:45,824 --> 01:57:48,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Sonic Adventure already leaked out.

1749
01:57:52,878 --> 01:57:54,279
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need Jet Set and we're good.

1750
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And Phantasy Star Online, the first ones.

1751
01:57:59,961 --> 01:58:00,802
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of cool.

1752
01:58:01,402 --> 01:58:04,823
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be actually really cool if Phantasy Star Online kind of came back, but on Xbox.

1753
01:58:05,904 --> 01:58:07,184
[SPEAKER_14]: There's still private servers, Rob.

1754
01:58:07,204 --> 01:58:08,585
[SPEAKER_14]: There's Phantasy Star Universe, too.

1755
01:58:08,925 --> 01:58:11,066
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't talk about that terrible game.

1756
01:58:11,426 --> 01:58:12,626
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that bad.

1757
01:58:12,726 --> 01:58:13,267
[SPEAKER_14]: It's awful.

1758
01:58:15,325 --> 01:58:22,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, every week we encourage you guys to send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we read a few of them here live on air.

1759
01:58:22,451 --> 01:58:22,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1760
01:58:22,771 --> 01:58:24,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we can, and we love you.

1761
01:58:27,695 --> 01:58:33,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Now usually DarkSakura dives in and reads the emails, but because she's under doctor's orders tonight, she's not going to read the emails.

1762
01:58:33,720 --> 01:58:34,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I am!

1763
01:58:36,662 --> 01:58:43,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, but DarkSakura can feel free to comment, but she won't be criticizing spelling and grammar, sadly, because she can't.

1764
01:58:44,148 --> 01:58:49,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, and plus I don't have good spelling and grammar, so I wouldn't be able to criticize you anyway.

1765
01:58:49,931 --> 01:58:50,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get to the first email.

1766
01:58:50,952 --> 01:58:54,794
[SPEAKER_14]: First email from our good pal, friend, buddy, RubbaBubbaBubba.

1767
01:58:55,414 --> 01:58:59,777
[SPEAKER_14]: RubbaBubba is emailing us because he wants to tell us about Season 2 of The Tester.

1768
01:59:00,577 --> 01:59:03,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I realize a lot of people gave The Tester shit.

1769
01:59:04,077 --> 01:59:05,859
[SPEAKER_14]: and somewhat rightfully so.

1770
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:10,023
[SPEAKER_14]: But it wasn't as terrible as I think some people made it out to be.

1771
01:59:10,063 --> 01:59:12,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of people who really criticized it didn't watch it.

1772
01:59:12,526 --> 01:59:14,307
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't the worst reality show I've ever seen.

1773
01:59:14,668 --> 01:59:18,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, didn't one of those chicks on The Real Housewives get a spinoff show?

1774
01:59:19,352 --> 01:59:20,213
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a few of them.

1775
01:59:20,233 --> 01:59:22,114
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're going to hate the tester when there's that?

1776
01:59:22,234 --> 01:59:22,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, just saying.

1777
01:59:23,435 --> 01:59:28,739
[SPEAKER_14]: So anyway, he wanted to write us to say, there is a casting call about to begin for season two of The Tester.

1778
01:59:28,759 --> 01:59:35,184
[SPEAKER_14]: The prize this year seems to be a one-year contract with Sony and a $10,000 cash prize.

1779
01:59:36,525 --> 01:59:37,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Miklatov, I found you a new job.

1780
01:59:39,117 --> 01:59:39,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, right.

1781
01:59:40,138 --> 01:59:41,478
[SPEAKER_14]: You've always wanted to be on a reality show, right?

1782
01:59:41,498 --> 01:59:42,338
[SPEAKER_14]: You could do this.

1783
01:59:42,358 --> 01:59:43,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just Survivor.

1784
01:59:43,579 --> 01:59:47,720
[SPEAKER_14]: www.thetester.com Well, this is kind of like Survivor, but not really.

1785
01:59:47,881 --> 01:59:52,042
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I know what being a tester is like, and I would not do that again.

1786
01:59:52,322 --> 01:59:53,123
[SPEAKER_04]: You just get the $10,000 prize and quit.

1787
01:59:54,841 --> 01:59:55,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, you're in a contract.

1788
01:59:55,961 --> 01:59:56,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true, huh?

1789
01:59:57,402 --> 01:59:59,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I could be really bad so they could break me of my contract.

1790
02:00:00,442 --> 02:00:11,105
[SPEAKER_14]: He also links us to a demonstration of the casting call at playstation-staging.gotcast.com You want to read the rules and all that stuff and get a video ready.

1791
02:00:11,245 --> 02:00:12,685
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe they're due any day now.

1792
02:00:13,165 --> 02:00:19,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see someone from OLR or even All Games kind of get in on this so I have someone to root for but I won't hold my breath.

1793
02:00:19,827 --> 02:00:21,407
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it might be fun though.

1794
02:00:22,884 --> 02:00:24,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Come on, those of you that are on Fun Employment.

1795
02:00:24,465 --> 02:00:26,046
[SPEAKER_14]: I could try, I guess, but I don't want to be a tester.

1796
02:00:26,066 --> 02:00:26,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Think about it.

1797
02:00:27,267 --> 02:00:27,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Reality show.

1798
02:00:29,308 --> 02:00:35,472
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so much fun to play the same... I don't think Nelly would be supportive of you leaving her with the new baby for a few weeks to go film this tester show.

1799
02:00:35,492 --> 02:00:36,133
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be dumb, yeah.

1800
02:00:36,193 --> 02:00:41,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody seems to understand that you played, like, the same stage over and over again for eight hours a day for, like, a month.

1801
02:00:41,937 --> 02:00:44,899
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to listen to the same song when you're doing steps for, like, a month.

1802
02:00:44,919 --> 02:00:46,120
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's a good song, it's okay.

1803
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:47,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like playing Earth Defense Force.

1804
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:49,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I still haven't played that.

1805
02:00:49,922 --> 02:00:50,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm missing out.

1806
02:00:51,505 --> 02:00:55,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Another email in our mailbag at mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com from Shook.

1807
02:00:56,513 --> 02:00:58,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And Shook writes us, Hi, OLR.

1808
02:00:58,916 --> 02:01:05,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I would personally like to thank DarkSakura for encouraging me to go back and replay good old Metal Gear Solid for the billionth time.

1809
02:01:07,936 --> 02:01:09,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's a listener sucking up.

1810
02:01:10,937 --> 02:01:11,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

1811
02:01:11,578 --> 02:01:12,518
[SPEAKER_14]: That's inappropriate.

1812
02:01:12,818 --> 02:01:16,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, thanks to PS1 Classics.

1813
02:01:16,420 --> 02:01:19,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I downloaded it and fell in love with it all over again.

1814
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:20,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I'm going to replay the others too.

1815
02:01:21,022 --> 02:01:23,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the excellent Game of the Week bit from Shook.

1816
02:01:24,243 --> 02:01:25,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job, DarkSakura.

1817
02:01:25,344 --> 02:01:27,325
[SPEAKER_14]: A pat on the back and a cookie for DarkSakura.

1818
02:01:27,965 --> 02:01:28,345
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1819
02:01:28,385 --> 02:01:32,647
[SPEAKER_14]: But it'll have to be like, I don't know, like a herb cookie or something because she's on the natural thing.

1820
02:01:33,287 --> 02:01:34,188
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get raw cookies.

1821
02:01:34,864 --> 02:01:35,224
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

1822
02:01:35,344 --> 02:01:36,325
[SPEAKER_16]: You can get raw cookies.

1823
02:01:37,325 --> 02:01:39,005
[SPEAKER_16]: And keep in mind, I'm 70% raw.

1824
02:01:40,686 --> 02:01:42,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see.

1825
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:44,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, going to an email from Damani125.

1826
02:01:44,927 --> 02:01:46,308
[SPEAKER_14]: This is our last email tonight, folks.

1827
02:01:46,388 --> 02:01:48,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this is going to be a great one, Miklatov.

1828
02:01:48,989 --> 02:01:52,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, OLR, I'm finally sending this email because I got a droid now.

1829
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:55,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, now I can listen to your live stream by means of a free app.

1830
02:01:55,151 --> 02:01:55,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

1831
02:01:56,010 --> 02:01:56,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Droid Diction Oblivion 5 Elder Scrolls 5

1832
02:02:18,788 --> 02:02:20,569
[SPEAKER_14]: And why are you barfing over there, Miklatov?

1833
02:02:21,590 --> 02:02:22,691
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this discussion.

1834
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:24,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but we didn't have it on the air.

1835
02:02:24,392 --> 02:02:25,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's have it real quick.

1836
02:02:27,093 --> 02:02:35,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you play, and if they have it there, Elder Scrolls V, I said that I will throw up because I hate the Elder Scrolls games.

1837
02:02:35,558 --> 02:02:35,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1838
02:02:35,979 --> 02:02:36,459
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great.

1839
02:02:36,499 --> 02:02:36,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Great!

1840
02:02:36,759 --> 02:02:37,319
[SPEAKER_04]: They're boring.

1841
02:02:37,339 --> 02:02:39,560
[SPEAKER_14]: They're some of the best games to ever come out for the season.

1842
02:02:39,580 --> 02:02:39,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1843
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:40,460
[SPEAKER_04]: You are an idiot.

1844
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even close.

1845
02:02:41,481 --> 02:02:43,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather... Okay, this is what happened.

1846
02:02:43,962 --> 02:02:47,063
[SPEAKER_04]: When Morrowind came out, everybody was like, oh, it's the best game ever.

1847
02:02:47,083 --> 02:02:49,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, okay, it's got to be awesome.

1848
02:02:49,824 --> 02:02:50,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody says so.

1849
02:02:51,244 --> 02:02:53,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Blockbuster and I rented it.

1850
02:02:53,585 --> 02:02:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I returned it, oh, like an hour later.

1851
02:02:57,646 --> 02:02:59,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh, you can just get another game.

1852
02:02:59,947 --> 02:03:02,288
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got Unlimited Saga.

1853
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:29,315
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I returned it like 20 minutes later and I just didn't care after that because both of those games were awful but my point is Elder Scrolls is so boring I guess it's because I don't like the fact that you have like the main story and you can do whatever you want that's cool but it feels a little bit too much like you can do whatever you want so who cares about the main story

1854
02:03:29,835 --> 02:03:31,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't I just go kill this entire town?

1855
02:03:31,837 --> 02:03:34,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I'll go be a vampire or something like that.

1856
02:03:36,101 --> 02:03:36,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like them.

1857
02:03:38,303 --> 02:03:43,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to give Fallout a try though, but I don't want to ever play an Elder Scrolls game again.

1858
02:03:44,381 --> 02:03:50,310
[SPEAKER_14]: So apparently this whole time, Bobby has been leading an effort to get Space Poncho to trend on Twitter.

1859
02:03:50,791 --> 02:03:55,898
[SPEAKER_14]: And he actually got some of the former Gamerscore blog people to start using Space Poncho.

1860
02:03:55,918 --> 02:03:59,083
[SPEAKER_14]: All these people are now using the term Space Poncho on Twitter.

1861
02:03:59,103 --> 02:03:59,684
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.

1862
02:04:02,557 --> 02:04:03,718
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to go get one tomorrow.

1863
02:04:04,298 --> 02:04:05,318
[SPEAKER_14]: I officially endorse this.

1864
02:04:05,378 --> 02:04:10,441
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a Twitter, you need to make a post right now about Space Poncho with a little tweet thing.

1865
02:04:10,621 --> 02:04:11,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, four new tweets just popped up.

1866
02:04:11,942 --> 02:04:12,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that.

1867
02:04:12,562 --> 02:04:18,285
[SPEAKER_11]: And now to make the full circle, we need a picture of President Cat wearing a Space Poncho.

1868
02:04:20,206 --> 02:04:22,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, good question from Salacious Pop in chat.

1869
02:04:22,367 --> 02:04:23,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you like other sandbox games?

1870
02:04:23,987 --> 02:04:24,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me examples.

1871
02:04:25,528 --> 02:04:27,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Grand Theft Auto 4, Red Dead Redemption.

1872
02:04:27,549 --> 02:04:32,672
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but my dislike for Red Dead Redemption is because I don't really like the old west.

1873
02:04:33,072 --> 02:04:36,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So the setting just wasn't... So you just don't like sandbox games.

1874
02:04:36,474 --> 02:04:37,554
[SPEAKER_14]: You want your games to be linear.

1875
02:04:37,974 --> 02:04:45,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which might be why I like Final Fantasy XIII so much because I go forward and I can just attack enemies and I don't have to do much else.

1876
02:04:45,778 --> 02:04:47,299
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let me go back to Damani's email here.

1877
02:04:47,839 --> 02:04:52,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I've never played Oblivion 4 until after I played Fallout 3, but I still am really far into the game.

1878
02:04:52,905 --> 02:04:57,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering if they'll ever make a fifth Oblivion, because it seems like they're focusing more on Fallout games now.

1879
02:04:57,750 --> 02:05:01,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I do like Fallout more than Oblivion, but it seems like... By the way, do you like Fallout?

1880
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:02,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it yet.

1881
02:05:02,591 --> 02:05:05,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I avoided it because people compared it to Elder Scrolls games.

1882
02:05:05,953 --> 02:05:07,074
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically Elder Scrolls with guns.

1883
02:05:07,395 --> 02:05:09,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Which might be better.

1884
02:05:11,157 --> 02:05:12,979
[SPEAKER_14]: There's less people that really have wanted to do a fifth one.

1885
02:05:13,259 --> 02:05:16,982
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seems like no one ever talks about Oblivion so Bethesda doesn't see it selling that good.

1886
02:05:17,382 --> 02:05:19,204
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I think you might be wrong, buddy.

1887
02:05:19,384 --> 02:05:21,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it did sell very well.

1888
02:05:21,285 --> 02:05:25,569
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think those games take years and years to develop.

1889
02:05:25,929 --> 02:05:28,131
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a rumor about an MMO based on Oblivion.

1890
02:05:28,151 --> 02:05:29,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that came out in court documents.

1891
02:05:30,132 --> 02:05:34,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that's why I think it's not happening for a while, and I was just wondering how much you wanted the fifth one.

1892
02:05:35,157 --> 02:05:35,958
[SPEAKER_14]: I want it very badly.

1893
02:05:36,418 --> 02:05:37,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and one last thing.

1894
02:05:37,139 --> 02:05:43,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I signed up for the Oil Army in the big battle at all games, and I think we need a battle cry, a battle hymn or song, and a slogan.

1895
02:05:44,105 --> 02:05:46,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, a slogan would be like, Fight for Farity Justice.

1896
02:05:47,148 --> 02:06:15,935
[SPEAKER_14]: a battle cry could be like for the ferret those are just examples I'm not sure what to do for the song well time for me to be hitting the old dusty trail I hope we get more people for the battle I'll be serving a tour of duty for OLR and Battlefield Bad Company 2 thank god I'm glad somebody's representing us in that because I don't own that game thank god hats off to you and I hope more people sign up for the Battlefield Bad Company 2 thing on the 26th I don't know do we have a battle cry that we could have we need to think about that chatters I put that to you too what should the battle cry be for the OLR army in the big battle

1897
02:06:16,435 --> 02:06:37,764
[SPEAKER_14]: and please remember guys for the horde please remember guys remember the number one rule of the oil army when you do participate in this event don't be a dick we like all these guys that are participating in it so don't be a dick it's just a fun thing it's a fun stupid it's like the olympics it promotes peace and harmony and a little bit of spirited competition that's what it's all about it's the olympics of video games

1898
02:06:38,824 --> 02:06:40,064
[SPEAKER_14]: But only all games is invited.

1899
02:06:41,105 --> 02:06:41,385
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1900
02:06:43,045 --> 02:06:43,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1901
02:06:43,385 --> 02:06:47,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Reject False Icons is possibly a battle cry that's being suggested.

1902
02:06:47,327 --> 02:06:47,787
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good one.

1903
02:06:47,887 --> 02:06:49,207
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that from SJ100Matt.

1904
02:06:50,488 --> 02:06:50,748
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1905
02:06:51,008 --> 02:06:51,788
[SPEAKER_14]: That was it for the mailbag.

1906
02:06:51,828 --> 02:06:55,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you would like to contribute more in the future.

1907
02:06:55,229 --> 02:06:57,130
[SPEAKER_14]: For now, we're going to get a little bit angsty.

1908
02:06:57,250 --> 02:06:57,770
[SPEAKER_14]: Grr.

1909
02:06:58,070 --> 02:06:58,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Arrgh.

1910
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:13,970
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.

1911
02:07:15,051 --> 02:07:16,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, F you to not having a voice.

1912
02:07:18,053 --> 02:07:18,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki!

1913
02:07:20,075 --> 02:07:24,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, F you to people on eBay to demand more money after an auction closes.

1914
02:07:24,258 --> 02:07:25,979
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not how eBay works, stupid.

1915
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:30,703
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the fact that I'm getting sick the day before E3.

1916
02:07:32,504 --> 02:07:32,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn it.

1917
02:07:33,845 --> 02:07:34,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Niklatov?

1918
02:07:35,590 --> 02:08:01,538
[SPEAKER_14]: FU to Roseville Golf Land for their crappy taking care of their beautiful Technica machine and for their 16 year old employees that are gone well that was a lot of angst tonight I think you guys did a very good job with your angst tonight we are going to get back into some gaming news but for some reason I forgot to put on our little list of things we're going to do tonight the Twitter topics we don't want to ignore Twitter so here we go we're going to go to Twitter topics right now

1919
02:08:07,034 --> 02:08:09,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Gears of War Art Director Makes an Unreal Movie Pitch

1920
02:08:33,633 --> 02:08:35,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd heard about this just before tonight's show.

1921
02:08:35,394 --> 02:08:38,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, the Mortal Kombat wasn't the only movie pitch to happen this week.

1922
02:08:38,637 --> 02:08:52,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Jerry O'Flaherty, which is our director for the original Gears of War, he apparently has done a pitch for a film called Samurai, but I guess it's based off Unreal, and you can actually look at a little clip right here, which there's one on the internet.

1923
02:08:53,887 --> 02:08:54,928
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's all artsy.

1924
02:08:55,549 --> 02:08:58,791
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of got that comic book-y look like 300 had a little bit.

1925
02:08:59,772 --> 02:09:00,272
[SPEAKER_14]: That could be cool.

1926
02:09:01,553 --> 02:09:06,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know though, haven't movies based on video games really not done well?

1927
02:09:06,382 --> 02:09:08,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Like Prince of Persia did not do as well as they thought, huh?

1928
02:09:10,510 --> 02:09:11,111
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of sad.

1929
02:09:12,575 --> 02:09:16,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Ayanami sent us a link here about Arcade Infinity closing down.

1930
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:19,622
[SPEAKER_14]: No, not before I can go play Technica.

1931
02:09:19,722 --> 02:09:21,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is everybody against me?

1932
02:09:21,304 --> 02:09:23,666
[SPEAKER_14]: This apparently, well, I don't think it's happened yet.

1933
02:09:24,407 --> 02:09:32,695
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is an extensive story that's coming from a website, Shoryuken.com, that I guess is talking about the possibility about Arcade Infinity closing down.

1934
02:09:32,755 --> 02:09:33,936
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what's going on.

1935
02:09:33,956 --> 02:09:35,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Just another week and then I don't care.

1936
02:09:36,418 --> 02:09:41,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I'm heartless Japan still has a lot of games to develop

1937
02:09:54,759 --> 02:09:58,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting, but it doesn't say anything about whether for sure this arcade is shutting down or not.

1938
02:09:58,481 --> 02:10:00,723
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the part that's kind of like getting me here.

1939
02:10:00,783 --> 02:10:03,624
[SPEAKER_14]: But I guess, I don't know, it kind of said here near the end.

1940
02:10:03,664 --> 02:10:04,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't read this whole story.

1941
02:10:04,665 --> 02:10:06,006
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a feature here.

1942
02:10:06,426 --> 02:10:11,389
[SPEAKER_14]: But they do intend to keep the arcade open strictly for the same reason he goes to work, the people.

1943
02:10:11,809 --> 02:10:13,550
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows most of the people out there are like a friend.

1944
02:10:13,591 --> 02:10:16,412
[SPEAKER_14]: The arcade to me is a business, but the people out there are now my friends.

1945
02:10:16,452 --> 02:10:17,913
[SPEAKER_14]: I get excited for the games that are played.

1946
02:10:18,614 --> 02:10:20,755
[SPEAKER_14]: So he doesn't say it's closing yet.

1947
02:10:21,135 --> 02:10:25,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That mentality closed all of the arcades back in Wichita.

1948
02:10:26,258 --> 02:10:26,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1949
02:10:26,739 --> 02:10:27,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of sad.

1950
02:10:27,839 --> 02:10:29,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they don't actually close.

1951
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:29,620
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be sad.

1952
02:10:31,301 --> 02:10:31,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1953
02:10:33,203 --> 02:10:34,303
[SPEAKER_14]: TigerClaw sent us another link.

1954
02:10:34,323 --> 02:10:35,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let him have two tweets tonight because I'm nice.

1955
02:10:36,445 --> 02:10:40,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Capcom will add Playboy advertising in Dead Rising 2 apparently is one of the big things.

1956
02:10:40,587 --> 02:10:45,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, there are magazines and actual magazine pictures on the wall and then actual magazines you can pick up that are Playboy.

1957
02:10:46,171 --> 02:10:48,993
[SPEAKER_14]: But this whole inserting

1958
02:10:49,873 --> 02:10:53,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Product placement or what have you in video games is kind of starting to become more and more of a trend.

1959
02:10:53,759 --> 02:10:56,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Yet another way to make money off of games besides the $10 thing.

1960
02:10:56,843 --> 02:11:01,670
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw Alan Wake this morning had the sync for the cars.

1961
02:11:02,892 --> 02:11:05,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what it's called beyond sync, but that was in there.

1962
02:11:06,737 --> 02:11:11,819
[SPEAKER_14]: So now the Playboy Bunny will show it up in the game along with some sexy ladies on the cover of the magazines.

1963
02:11:11,859 --> 02:11:12,199
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1964
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:12,959
[SPEAKER_14]: She's not wearing a bra.

1965
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:13,980
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that, Miklatov?

1966
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,080
[SPEAKER_14]: She has no bra on.

1967
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,020
[SPEAKER_04]: I have bad eyes.

1968
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:16,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell.

1969
02:11:17,141 --> 02:11:17,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just letting you know.

1970
02:11:17,861 --> 02:11:20,042
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to have saggy boobs when she's old.

1971
02:11:22,622 --> 02:11:23,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she's not wearing a bra?

1972
02:11:24,823 --> 02:11:26,644
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why women wear a bra.

1973
02:11:27,244 --> 02:11:28,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we don't want to know her when she's old.

1974
02:11:29,045 --> 02:11:30,005
[SPEAKER_11]: We just want to know her now.

1975
02:11:32,208 --> 02:11:35,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Iannami wants to send us this too about a story about Death Smiles.

1976
02:11:35,589 --> 02:11:37,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently it's getting a US localization.

1977
02:11:38,410 --> 02:11:40,591
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be coming out later this June by Axis.

1978
02:11:40,951 --> 02:11:42,432
[SPEAKER_14]: It was originally developed by Cave.

1979
02:11:42,872 --> 02:11:46,733
[SPEAKER_14]: They did Don Donpachi, Espegluta, and all these fun games.

1980
02:11:47,433 --> 02:11:49,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there's going to be a localization.

1981
02:11:49,094 --> 02:11:49,954
[SPEAKER_14]: The game is in English.

1982
02:11:50,034 --> 02:11:51,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Hooray, Death Smiles.

1983
02:11:51,415 --> 02:11:55,636
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming out in a limited edition set with a faceplate and soundtrack.

1984
02:11:57,702 --> 02:11:57,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

1985
02:11:59,405 --> 02:11:59,705
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1986
02:11:59,946 --> 02:12:01,589
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to do it for Twitter topics tonight.

1987
02:12:01,629 --> 02:12:04,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, twitter.com slash OLR if you want to send us some tweets.

1988
02:12:04,634 --> 02:12:08,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Show us your tweets a little bit like the ladies in the Playboy magazine like to do.

1989
02:12:09,679 --> 02:12:11,721
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's get back into some news, Loki.

1990
02:12:40,022 --> 02:12:43,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, before this lawsuit, I did not know there was an active.com.

1991
02:12:43,583 --> 02:12:53,426
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll have to see what happens or what that's going to do with EA Sports Active 2, which will be out this fall.

1992
02:12:56,347 --> 02:12:56,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1993
02:12:57,428 --> 02:12:58,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds stupid.

1994
02:13:01,949 --> 02:13:02,629
[SPEAKER_14]: More lawsuits.

1995
02:13:02,709 --> 02:13:03,410
[SPEAKER_14]: This is America.

1996
02:13:03,750 --> 02:13:04,490
[SPEAKER_14]: God bless America.

1997
02:13:04,821 --> 02:13:15,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft.com wants some money sorry I was a little bit of dead air there I was looking at Space Poncho tweets on Twitter because apparently somebody actually made a Twitter account called Space Poncho now how long did that take like five seconds

1998
02:13:16,033 --> 02:13:18,215
[SPEAKER_14]: A++ to whatever All Games Listener did that.

1999
02:13:18,255 --> 02:13:20,177
[SPEAKER_14]: If it wasn't All Games Listener, it might have been somebody, I don't know.

2000
02:13:20,317 --> 02:13:22,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Some other people are having fun with that little title now, too.

2001
02:13:22,879 --> 02:13:23,159
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2002
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:24,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

2003
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:30,805
[SPEAKER_14]: This game, I saw this actually originally on an Oh No They Didn't post earlier this week, but it also hit Destructoid.

2004
02:13:30,846 --> 02:13:35,690
[SPEAKER_14]: It's apparently a game called Hey Baby, and I'm not talking about the No Doubt song.

2005
02:13:35,730 --> 02:13:39,213
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this is a game called Hey Baby where you play a woman

2006
02:13:39,833 --> 02:13:43,077
[SPEAKER_14]: who gets aggressively catcalled by men.

2007
02:13:43,538 --> 02:13:48,164
[SPEAKER_14]: They will say, hey baby, nice ass, or hey, I wanna fuck you, or whatever they're gonna say.

2008
02:13:48,805 --> 02:13:54,192
[SPEAKER_14]: And in this game, you take your aggressions out on these men by killing them.

2009
02:13:54,813 --> 02:13:56,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when you kill them, they turn into tombstones.

2010
02:13:56,635 --> 02:13:57,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like fun.

2011
02:13:58,277 --> 02:14:02,858
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, um, it looked pretty awful, I gotta say, actually, from the little trailer I saw.

2012
02:14:03,278 --> 02:14:10,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the comment I posted on OhNoTheyDidn't when I saw the little graphics, I was like, I think Hexen in 1996 had better graphics than this game.

2013
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:12,840
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually a little trailer here we can actually look at here.

2014
02:14:12,860 --> 02:14:14,420
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a thing on Twitter here.

2015
02:14:16,441 --> 02:14:17,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It's payback time, boys!

2016
02:14:17,921 --> 02:14:18,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at the graphics.

2017
02:14:20,722 --> 02:14:21,762
[SPEAKER_14]: The graphics are terrible.

2018
02:14:23,762 --> 02:14:25,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna see if we can get some of the, uh...

2019
02:14:33,748 --> 02:14:36,349
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those guys said, God bless you, and you're going to shoot him?

2020
02:14:36,750 --> 02:14:37,950
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a nice thing to say.

2021
02:14:37,970 --> 02:14:40,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you're only supposed to shoot the bad people.

2022
02:14:40,051 --> 02:14:41,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Some women are dopes.

2023
02:14:41,812 --> 02:14:42,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Not all, just some.

2024
02:14:42,892 --> 02:14:45,493
[SPEAKER_14]: But somebody saying, God bless you, that's not hitting on you.

2025
02:14:45,533 --> 02:14:48,314
[SPEAKER_14]: You're probably ugly if you think that's the case, okay?

2026
02:14:53,416 --> 02:14:55,357
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you shoot them and they turn into one-two stones.

2027
02:14:56,761 --> 02:15:25,420
[SPEAKER_14]: and the tombstones say such awesome things as I love you and you should leave your man and come with me and wow you're so beautiful this game looks stupid and yep she shot the guy and said god bless you here's a flamethrower instead don't play this game this looks stupid like I'm all for like woman power and stuff but play Metroid it sounded like it would be fun for just a little waste of time as a flash game but that looked really dumb

2028
02:15:33,712 --> 02:15:34,273
[SPEAKER_14]: That's funny.

2029
02:15:35,535 --> 02:15:36,336
[SPEAKER_14]: What, the game?

2030
02:15:36,596 --> 02:15:36,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2031
02:15:36,917 --> 02:15:38,098
[SPEAKER_14]: It just looks terrible.

2032
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:39,941
[SPEAKER_14]: It is terrible.

2033
02:15:39,981 --> 02:15:40,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I get it.

2034
02:15:40,482 --> 02:15:42,264
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a nice concept for a game.

2035
02:15:42,344 --> 02:15:45,389
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny, but it's just executed terribly.

2036
02:15:47,078 --> 02:15:56,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to get into another part of the show here that, gosh, we have not done this in a very, very, very, very, very long time.

2037
02:15:57,106 --> 02:15:58,427
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm excited tonight.

2038
02:15:58,467 --> 02:16:02,890
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to bring back the Orange Lounge Radio match game.

2039
02:16:02,950 --> 02:16:03,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's right.

2040
02:16:03,470 --> 02:16:07,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Video game match game here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2041
02:16:17,365 --> 02:16:22,152
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, some breaking news, and I'm not going to play the theme, but apparently the space ponchos just lit up green.

2042
02:16:24,194 --> 02:16:26,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are we not going to this tomorrow?

2043
02:16:27,399 --> 02:16:28,000
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to work.

2044
02:16:28,040 --> 02:16:28,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

2045
02:16:29,021 --> 02:16:30,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm telling you, they're going to do the year 2000 thing.

2046
02:16:33,702 --> 02:16:34,023
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2047
02:16:35,364 --> 02:16:36,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, let's get into the match game.

02:18:00,825 --> 02:18:01,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Space ponchos.

2067
02:18:04,126 --> 02:18:05,047
[SPEAKER_14]: They're demanding it.

2068
02:18:05,087 --> 02:18:06,307
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to get them.

2069
02:18:06,447 --> 02:18:07,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't go.

2070
02:18:07,908 --> 02:18:09,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Cough a little more.

2071
02:18:09,449 --> 02:18:10,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds sicker.

2072
02:18:11,630 --> 02:18:11,970
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2073
02:18:12,710 --> 02:18:15,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I count these people that are saying ponchos in space?

2074
02:18:15,231 --> 02:18:15,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2075
02:18:15,531 --> 02:18:15,811
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2076
02:18:16,171 --> 02:18:16,792
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll count them.

2077
02:18:17,052 --> 02:18:21,073
[SPEAKER_14]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

02:18:22,874 --> 02:18:24,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Pick a number between one and ten.

2080
02:18:25,115 --> 02:18:25,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Who, me?

2081
02:18:25,575 --> 02:18:26,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov, yes.

2082
02:18:26,516 --> 02:18:31,338
[SPEAKER_14]: You can pick a number between 1 and 10, Miklatov, because you're our guest.

2083
02:18:31,698 --> 02:18:31,338
4.

2084
02:18:31,718 --> 02:18:33,799
[SPEAKER_14]: 1, 2, 3, 4.

2085
02:18:32,118 --> 02:18:33,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Ziba is going to get to play tonight.

2086
02:18:33,859 --> 02:18:36,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to Ziba and say congrats.

2087
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:39,641
[SPEAKER_14]: You are playing...

2088
02:18:41,838 --> 02:18:43,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Stand by.

2089
02:18:43,939 --> 02:18:48,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so whether you like it or not, we're playing against Ziba.

2090
02:18:48,742 --> 02:18:50,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, any, oops, wrong music.

2091
02:18:51,004 --> 02:18:52,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, match game theme, hello.

2092
02:18:52,425 --> 02:18:53,966
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a little while since we've done match game here.

2093
02:18:54,006 --> 02:18:55,767
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little bit rusty here at Orange Laundry Studios.

2094
02:18:56,487 --> 02:19:00,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan, do you have any words of discouragement for Ziba tonight, your opponent?

2095
02:19:01,731 --> 02:19:02,111
[SPEAKER_14]: I win.

2096
02:19:04,192 --> 02:19:05,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see what happens.

2097
02:19:05,233 --> 02:19:06,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't argue that.

2098
02:19:06,193 --> 02:19:07,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let me explain.

2099
02:19:08,035 --> 02:19:09,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me explain how the match game works.

2100
02:19:10,899 --> 02:19:11,219
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

2101
02:19:38,117 --> 02:19:38,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Just for tonight.

2102
02:19:39,097 --> 02:19:40,819
[SPEAKER_14]: The one and only Techmaster Loki.

2103
02:19:41,319 --> 02:19:41,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

2104
02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:44,641
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, the biggest celebrity of them all, me.

2105
02:19:45,582 --> 02:19:45,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

2106
02:19:46,623 --> 02:19:48,884
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one and only Miglatov.

2107
02:19:49,024 --> 02:19:50,065
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what else to call him.

2108
02:19:51,086 --> 02:19:53,627
[SPEAKER_14]: DJ Max Technica not playing Miglatov.

2109
02:19:53,647 --> 02:19:55,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Arcade Infinity is going to close.

2110
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:58,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the drive back up, Sunnyvale is going to burn down or something.

2111
02:19:58,891 --> 02:20:00,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just can't win.

2112
02:20:02,677 --> 02:20:03,438
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2113
02:20:21,314 --> 02:20:24,035
[SPEAKER_14]: So all our followers on Twitter will get to see whatever you want to plug.

2114
02:20:24,496 --> 02:20:25,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and you can plug it here on the show as well.

2115
02:20:26,016 --> 02:20:27,397
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a fabulous prize, is it not?

2116
02:20:27,897 --> 02:20:29,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

2117
02:20:29,758 --> 02:20:30,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one.

2118
02:20:31,299 --> 02:20:31,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number one.

2119
02:20:32,059 --> 02:20:32,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is.

2120
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:39,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight.

2121
02:20:41,444 --> 02:20:43,805
[SPEAKER_14]: Leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.

2122
02:20:45,151 --> 02:21:03,868
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing Let me read that one more time

2123
02:21:05,037 --> 02:21:12,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.

2124
02:21:13,082 --> 02:21:17,325
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing.

2125
02:21:21,688 --> 02:21:21,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan is in.

2127
02:21:23,629 --> 02:21:24,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding for me, too.

[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:26,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki's in.

[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

2131
02:21:27,411 --> 02:21:28,812
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura has given the thumbs up.

2132
02:21:28,852 --> 02:21:30,113
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the equivalent of a ding.

2133
02:21:30,133 --> 02:21:32,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just waiting on Ziba to send me a private message.

2134
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:34,920
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see.

2135
02:21:34,940 --> 02:21:38,382
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as Ziba sends me a private message there in chat, we'll be good to go.

2136
02:21:39,922 --> 02:21:44,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, of course, if any of our folks are struggling, they can always read chat here.

2137
02:21:45,184 --> 02:21:47,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Need and... Okay, there we go.

2138
02:21:47,625 --> 02:21:48,485
[SPEAKER_14]: We got an answer from Ziba.

2139
02:21:48,826 --> 02:21:49,146
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2140
02:21:49,746 --> 02:21:50,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

2141
02:21:50,206 --> 02:21:51,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number one tonight.

2142
02:21:51,487 --> 02:21:56,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft is being super secretive about their Project Natal reveal tonight, leaving all the exclusive video to MTV.

2143
02:21:57,389 --> 02:22:01,610
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the blank they will be showing.

2144
02:22:02,071 --> 02:22:03,091
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, what is your answer?

2145
02:22:03,726 --> 02:22:26,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Space ponchos Space ponchos they will be showing What a surprise that that answer came up Alright, Ziba says They don't want people finding out about all the Games they will be showing What a serious answer Which means she's not gonna win It's like the poor person on the show That gets booed No, don't boo, it's a good answer If it was a real game show

2146
02:22:27,489 --> 02:22:27,769
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

2147
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:28,350
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know.

2148
02:22:28,971 --> 02:22:29,571
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know.

2149
02:22:29,992 --> 02:22:31,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe DarkSakura's like, I'm sick.

2150
02:22:31,614 --> 02:22:33,556
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to write funny answers tonight.

2151
02:22:33,876 --> 02:22:39,302
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, this is because they don't want people to find out about all the... Watermelon smashing.

2152
02:22:39,563 --> 02:22:41,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Watermelon smashing they'll be showing.

2153
02:22:41,745 --> 02:22:44,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, that is not a match with Space Poncho.

2154
02:22:45,228 --> 02:22:51,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, they don't want people to find out about all the... Survey says space ponchos.

2155
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:52,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Space ponchos!

2156
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:54,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

2157
02:22:54,430 --> 02:22:56,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan gets a match.

2158
02:22:56,231 --> 02:22:58,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, Ryan.

2159
02:22:58,111 --> 02:23:00,872
[SPEAKER_14]: It's one, Ziba, none.

2160
02:23:00,932 --> 02:23:01,612
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay, Ziba.

2161
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:02,773
[SPEAKER_14]: There's four questions tonight.

2162
02:23:02,813 --> 02:23:04,153
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a chance.

2163
02:23:04,193 --> 02:23:05,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Ziba just sent me a cry.

2164
02:23:05,573 --> 02:23:06,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Emote icon, don't cry.

2165
02:23:06,814 --> 02:23:07,574
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a good answer.

2166
02:23:08,868 --> 02:23:09,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Good thing there's no money

2167
02:23:26,019 --> 02:23:26,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Half point.

2168
02:23:27,481 --> 02:23:29,283
[SPEAKER_15]: I give a half point too.

2169
02:23:29,343 --> 02:23:30,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Half point?

2170
02:23:30,905 --> 02:23:34,068
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually think ports are games, so I say games.

2171
02:23:34,148 --> 02:23:35,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I'm outvoted.

2172
02:23:35,209 --> 02:23:37,051
[SPEAKER_14]: A half point for Ziba on that one.

2173
02:23:37,211 --> 02:23:38,553
[SPEAKER_14]: And judges' rules are final.

2174
02:23:39,274 --> 02:23:40,715
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't real TV.

2175
02:23:41,095 --> 02:23:41,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2176
02:23:43,739 --> 02:23:44,699
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my answer.

2177
02:23:44,739 --> 02:23:51,765
[SPEAKER_14]: This is because they don't want people to find out about all the Bukkake-covered space ponchos they will be showing.

2178
02:23:52,345 --> 02:23:53,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there you go.

2179
02:23:53,106 --> 02:23:53,886
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the surprise.

2180
02:23:53,927 --> 02:23:55,948
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why they have to wear the splash zone there.

2181
02:23:56,789 --> 02:23:58,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a match with space ponchos, though?

2182
02:23:58,770 --> 02:24:01,232
[SPEAKER_14]: He didn't say Bukkake-covered, and I think that part is important.

2183
02:24:01,733 --> 02:24:04,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Could be a half point because the other half is Bukkake.

2184
02:24:04,495 --> 02:24:05,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2185
02:24:05,495 --> 02:24:06,036
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you guys think?

2186
02:24:06,076 --> 02:24:08,398
[SPEAKER_14]: A half point for X-Link for Bukkake-covered space ponchos?

2187
02:24:08,438 --> 02:24:09,979
[SPEAKER_14]: He does say space ponchos, though.

2188
02:24:11,296 --> 02:24:25,271
[SPEAKER_14]: What they're covered with, we don't know Alright, so a half point for X-Link So it's one and a half to a half There you go There it is, question number one, right there How about question number two, you feeling good so far?

2189
02:24:25,651 --> 02:24:26,893
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, you have a one point lead

2190
02:24:28,084 --> 02:24:29,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always feeling good.

2191
02:24:29,044 --> 02:24:29,885
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

2192
02:24:29,925 --> 02:24:33,106
[SPEAKER_14]: And we made your opponent cry tonight.

2193
02:24:34,906 --> 02:24:37,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I always make my opponents cry, so that's nothing.

2194
02:24:38,228 --> 02:24:39,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, be nice.

2195
02:24:40,308 --> 02:24:40,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2196
02:24:41,589 --> 02:24:42,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number two.

2197
02:24:43,829 --> 02:24:44,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear?

2198
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:47,291
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are supposed to go, what?

2199
02:24:48,631 --> 02:24:49,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's try it again.

2200
02:24:49,651 --> 02:24:50,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear?

2201
02:24:52,292 --> 02:24:57,234
[SPEAKER_14]: The Mortal Kombat movie franchise might be coming back if one director gets his way.

2202
02:24:58,376 --> 02:24:58,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

2203

[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

02:25:24,859 --> 02:25:43,338
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, did you hear the Mortal Kombat movie franchise might be coming back if one director gets his way?

2207
02:25:43,678 --> 02:25:48,303
[SPEAKER_14]: The reboot might be pretty cool, but the cast of Orange Ones Radio really hopes the director doesn't forget to have...

2208
02:25:49,551 --> 02:26:18,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Dinosaurs Dinosaurs in the movie Cause dinosaurs and Mortal Kombat Have so much in common Alright It is Primal Rage Oh that would be an awesome movie Zeba says The cast of Orange Lounge Radio really hopes The director doesn't forget to have Spongebob in the movie Because Fatalities right Now that was a better answer Dinosaurs Okay

2209
02:26:18,789 --> 02:26:21,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's start with DarkSakura.

2210
02:26:22,715 --> 02:26:28,264
[SPEAKER_14]: The cast of Orange Lounge Radio really hopes the director of the new Mortal Kombat movie doesn't forget to have... Cher playing Sindel.

2211
02:26:29,146 --> 02:26:32,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Cher playing Sindel, the chick with the gray hair.

2212
02:26:33,064 --> 02:26:33,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Cher, okay.

2213
02:26:33,905 --> 02:26:34,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you imagine Cher?

2214
02:26:34,906 --> 02:26:35,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I could with her voice.

2215
02:26:35,806 --> 02:26:36,947
[SPEAKER_14]: She could sing and it would be like that.

2216
02:26:38,308 --> 02:26:39,289
[SPEAKER_14]: That whole little thing.

2217
02:26:39,349 --> 02:26:43,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I was watching Kathy Griffin earlier today and I love her impression of Cher.

2218
02:26:43,612 --> 02:26:44,373
[SPEAKER_02]: You crazy bitch.

2219
02:26:45,014 --> 02:26:47,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, not a match though.

02:26:47,215 --> 02:26:47,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a match.

2221
02:26:47,616 --> 02:26:47,956
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2222
02:26:48,957 --> 02:26:49,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

2223
02:26:51,739 --> 02:26:53,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, did you hear?

2224
02:26:54,981 --> 02:26:55,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2225
02:26:55,902 --> 02:26:59,125
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna have space punchalities in the game.

2226
02:27:01,027 --> 02:27:01,888
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be crazy.

2227
02:27:02,288 --> 02:27:04,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Ponchalities.

2228
02:27:04,210 --> 02:27:06,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Good answer, but not a match.

2229
02:27:06,872 --> 02:27:08,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Ponchalities.

2230
02:27:08,613 --> 02:27:14,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Mikhotov, we really hope the director does not forget to have... Stryker.

2231
02:27:15,078 --> 02:27:17,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Stryker in the movie.

2232
02:27:17,460 --> 02:27:18,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Why Stryker?

2233
02:27:18,301 --> 02:27:19,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Because everybody hates him.

2234
02:27:21,519 --> 02:27:23,760
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, where the hell did the dinosaur answer come from?

2235
02:27:23,780 --> 02:27:27,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you thinking about Mortal Kombat 2 where you could do the animalities?

2236
02:27:40,848 --> 02:27:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking Jurassic Park and Mortal Kombat.

2237
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:44,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

2238
02:27:44,451 --> 02:27:46,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to have something worth fighting.

2239
02:27:47,073 --> 02:27:47,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

2240
02:27:48,154 --> 02:27:48,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

2241
02:27:48,554 --> 02:27:50,435
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's go to the scoreboard.

2242
02:27:50,676 --> 02:27:51,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan is still leading.

2243
02:27:52,237 --> 02:27:53,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I keep calling you by your real name.

2244
02:27:53,238 --> 02:27:53,698
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope you don't mind.

2245
02:27:54,038 --> 02:27:58,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan is leading with one and a half points to Ziba's half point, but it's still anybody's game.

2246
02:28:00,049 --> 02:28:01,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's still anybody's game.

2247
02:28:02,210 --> 02:28:03,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov's just putting it together.

2248
02:28:03,610 --> 02:28:04,670

02:28:11,652 --> 02:28:12,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, let me play the music.

2253
02:28:14,733 --> 02:28:19,774
[SPEAKER_14]: We are so sad, so sad that Portal 2 got delayed until 2011.

2254
02:28:21,519 --> 02:28:49,450
[SPEAKER_14]: but in an exclusive statement to Orange Lounge Radio Valve said we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add blank into the game ding ding ding ding ding

2255

[SPEAKER_14]: We are so sad that Portal 2 got delayed until 2011.

2256
02:28:55,848 --> 02:28:57,989
[SPEAKER_14]: An exclusive statement to Orange Lounge Radio.

2257
02:28:58,670 --> 02:29:04,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Valve said we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add blank into the game.

2258
02:29:05,935 --> 02:29:07,976
[SPEAKER_14]: We are waiting for Ziba to lock in an answer.

2259
02:29:10,678 --> 02:29:11,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, she just did.

2260
02:29:11,339 --> 02:29:11,659
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

2261
02:29:11,719 --> 02:29:12,019
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2262
02:29:13,881 --> 02:29:14,841
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, X-Link.

2263
02:29:15,482 --> 02:29:16,182
[SPEAKER_14]: We need an answer.

2264
02:29:16,242 --> 02:29:19,725
[SPEAKER_14]: We had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add...

2265
02:29:21,167 --> 02:29:24,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Ponchos into the game.

2266
02:29:24,370 --> 02:29:28,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to point out, these questions were written like two hours before tonight's show, okay?

2267
02:29:29,014 --> 02:29:31,056
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had no... I'm just saying.

2268
02:29:31,837 --> 02:29:33,978
[SPEAKER_11]: This was pre-Space Poncho era.

2269
02:29:34,018 --> 02:29:34,419
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

2270
02:29:34,859 --> 02:29:35,220
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2271
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:42,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Ziba says, we forgot to add bouncing balls into the game.

2272
02:29:43,927 --> 02:29:45,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Were there bouncing balls in Portal?

2273
02:29:45,749 --> 02:29:45,829
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2274
02:29:46,345 --> 02:29:54,948
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, we had to delay the release of Portal 2 because we forgot to add... Unsaturated polyester resin, fiberglass surface resins, and volatile malted milk impoundments.

2275
02:30:15,156 --> 02:30:15,397
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2276
02:30:15,497 --> 02:30:16,438
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the cake recipe.

2277
02:30:18,739 --> 02:30:20,261
[SPEAKER_14]: You're dumb, but I love you.

2278
02:30:20,281 --> 02:30:21,762
[SPEAKER_02]: When you find the cake.

2279
02:30:21,922 --> 02:30:22,503
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

2280
02:30:22,523 --> 02:30:23,183
[SPEAKER_02]: The cake sphere.

2281
02:30:23,423 --> 02:30:24,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the recipe.

2282
02:30:24,124 --> 02:30:27,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That and, you know, fish shaped, you know, methyl something.

2283
02:30:28,308 --> 02:30:28,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I get it.

2284
02:30:28,708 --> 02:30:29,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Nerd joke.

2285
02:30:29,208 --> 02:30:29,549
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

2286
02:30:29,689 --> 02:30:30,009
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

2287
02:30:30,129 --> 02:30:30,589
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a good job.

2288
02:30:30,630 --> 02:30:30,990
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's funny.

2289
02:30:31,450 --> 02:30:32,071
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Loki.

2290
02:30:32,131 --> 02:30:33,512
[SPEAKER_14]: They forgot to add cake.

2291
02:30:34,161 --> 02:30:56,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Cake into the game Alright Miklatov, not a match Miklatov, they forgot to add Cake into the game Oh my gosh, Cake would have taken the cake Alright Alright, my answer We had to delay the release of Portal 2 Because we forgot to add Bukkake-covered space ponchos Into the game I guess that's half a point for X-Link, isn't it?

2292
02:30:57,547 --> 02:30:58,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it worked before, right?

2293
02:30:59,087 --> 02:31:02,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, two points for X-Link A half point for Ziba

2294
02:31:03,373 --> 02:31:03,853
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2295
02:31:04,474 --> 02:31:05,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, one more question.

2296
02:31:05,514 --> 02:31:07,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Ziba, it is not over yet.

2297
02:31:08,597 --> 02:31:09,437
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not over.

2298
02:31:09,857 --> 02:31:10,998
[SPEAKER_14]: You still have a chance.

2299
02:31:11,759 --> 02:31:12,519
[SPEAKER_14]: You can do this.

2300
02:31:14,080 --> 02:31:15,701
[SPEAKER_14]: It was officially announced tonight.

2301
02:31:15,822 --> 02:31:16,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, where's the music?

2302
02:31:17,343 --> 02:31:18,664
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't play Mexican with no music.

2303
02:31:20,285 --> 02:31:20,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2304
02:31:21,826 --> 02:31:29,071
[SPEAKER_14]: It was officially announced tonight that the new Xbox motion controller will be called the Xbox Kinect.

2305
02:31:30,475 --> 02:31:33,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn it, explained Loki upon hearing this news.

2306
02:31:34,737 --> 02:31:41,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a super secret insider that told me to bet all my money on Xbox Blake.

2307
02:31:44,462 --> 02:31:44,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

2308
02:31:45,662 --> 02:31:46,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Ding.

2309
02:31:47,043 --> 02:31:47,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

2310
02:31:56,910 --> 02:31:58,531
[SPEAKER_14]: That was very fast dings there.

2311
02:31:58,911 --> 02:32:03,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a super secret insider that told me to bet all my money on Xbox blank.

2312
02:32:05,896 --> 02:32:06,837
[SPEAKER_14]: We're waiting on Ziba.

2313
02:32:06,937 --> 02:32:07,818
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm dinged too, by the way.

2314
02:32:07,838 --> 02:32:09,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot to say that, but I have dinged my answer.

2315
02:32:11,720 --> 02:32:14,082
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're just waiting on Ziba to think of an answer there.

2316
02:32:14,742 --> 02:32:16,323
[SPEAKER_14]: If she needs help, you can look at the chat room.

2317
02:32:16,363 --> 02:32:19,766
[SPEAKER_14]: The chatters always like to yell out some answers and try to help out a little bit.

2318
02:32:20,847 --> 02:32:21,547
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see what happens.

2319
02:32:23,508 --> 02:32:23,989
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way...

2320
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:25,746
[SPEAKER_14]: This just in...

02:32:31,045 --> 02:32:31,425
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

2323
02:32:31,545 --> 02:32:33,246
[SPEAKER_14]: President Cat in a Space Poncho.

2324
02:32:33,286 --> 02:32:33,907
[SPEAKER_14]: There you have it.

2325
02:32:33,927 --> 02:32:34,747
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

2326
02:32:36,949 --> 02:32:37,489
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it.

2327
02:32:39,811 --> 02:32:40,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me post that.

2328
02:32:40,991 --> 02:32:42,613
[SPEAKER_14]: That is truly creepy.

2329
02:32:43,233 --> 02:32:44,474
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes me very happy too.

2330
02:32:45,354 --> 02:32:48,056
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just retweet that so all our OLR people can see that.

2331
02:32:48,276 --> 02:32:49,397
[SPEAKER_02]: My Sims game froze.

2332
02:32:49,417 --> 02:32:50,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to close it now.

2333
02:32:50,218 --> 02:32:50,618
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2334
02:32:50,898 --> 02:32:51,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Now everybody can look at that.

2335
02:32:51,799 --> 02:32:52,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2336
02:32:52,999 --> 02:32:54,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I went ahead and reposted that.

2337
02:32:55,261 --> 02:32:56,061
[SPEAKER_14]: That's beautiful.

2338
02:32:58,482 --> 02:32:59,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we got an answer here.

2339
02:33:00,184 --> 02:33:00,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

2340
02:33:01,365 --> 02:33:05,469
[SPEAKER_14]: It was officially announced tonight that the new Xbox motion controller will be called the Xbox Kinect.

2341
02:33:05,869 --> 02:33:07,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Damn it, exclaimed Loki upon hearing this news.

2342
02:33:07,871 --> 02:33:12,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a super secret insider tell me to bet all my money on Xbox... X-Link?

2343
02:33:13,783 --> 02:33:14,223
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

2344
02:33:40,049 --> 02:33:40,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Space Poncho The Xbox Propel

2345
02:34:03,817 --> 02:34:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost had that.

2346
02:34:04,857 --> 02:34:06,698
[SPEAKER_14]: The Xbox Propel.

2347
02:34:06,858 --> 02:34:08,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Good answer, but not a match.

2348
02:34:08,758 --> 02:34:09,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Mikhail Tov.

2349
02:34:09,799 --> 02:34:11,079
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox Motion++.

2350
02:34:12,219 --> 02:34:14,360
[SPEAKER_14]: The Xbox Motion++.

2351
02:34:14,420 --> 02:34:16,201
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I see what you're doing there, but not a match.

2352
02:34:16,921 --> 02:34:22,642
[SPEAKER_14]: And lastly, my name, they were going to call it the Xbox Freestyle and Pose.

2353
02:34:23,242 --> 02:34:24,783
[SPEAKER_14]: The Xbox FAP.

2354
02:34:26,423 --> 02:34:28,524
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell are they doing?

2355
02:34:54,179 --> 02:34:54,460
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2356
02:34:55,020 --> 02:34:56,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for match game tonight.

2357
02:34:56,942 --> 02:34:58,323
[SPEAKER_14]: The final score is Ziba.

2358
02:34:58,463 --> 02:34:59,364
[SPEAKER_14]: You got a half point.

2359
02:34:59,885 --> 02:35:02,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan, X-Link, you got two and a half points.

2360
02:35:02,347 --> 02:35:03,228
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link is our winner.

2361
02:35:03,348 --> 02:35:04,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

2362
02:35:04,449 --> 02:35:05,130
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, good job.

2363
02:35:05,510 --> 02:35:06,251
[SPEAKER_14]: A round of applause.

2364
02:35:06,291 --> 02:35:07,572
[SPEAKER_14]: A good effort for Ziba.

2365
02:35:07,692 --> 02:35:08,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

2366
02:35:08,893 --> 02:35:09,414
[SPEAKER_14]: But she lost.

2367
02:35:09,454 --> 02:35:10,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Ziba.

2368
02:35:10,315 --> 02:35:10,815
[SPEAKER_14]: But good effort.

2369
02:35:11,336 --> 02:35:11,596
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2370
02:35:11,656 --> 02:35:12,557
[SPEAKER_14]: At least you got a half point.

2371
02:35:12,617 --> 02:35:14,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Most times these are complete shutouts.

2372
02:35:14,599 --> 02:35:15,260
[SPEAKER_14]: So good job.

2373
02:35:16,457 --> 02:35:24,226
[SPEAKER_14]: X-Link, as the winner, you get to plug anything you want here on the show tonight and we will even post it to Twitter, so send it to me as a private message.

2374
02:35:24,546 --> 02:35:26,208
[SPEAKER_14]: What would you like to plug on tonight's program?

2375
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know.

2376
02:35:30,233 --> 02:35:34,018
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know about this ahead of time, so I really don't have anything to plug.

2377
02:35:34,534 --> 02:35:35,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there you have it.

2378
02:35:35,435 --> 02:35:36,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job, X-Lane.

2379
02:35:36,356 --> 02:35:39,338
[SPEAKER_14]: He's plugging apathy.

2380
02:35:41,981 --> 02:35:42,661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually funny.

2381
02:35:42,681 --> 02:35:47,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just looking at Threadless and there's a shirt on there that apathy, our country's leading cause of whatever.

2382
02:35:48,206 --> 02:35:52,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you plug Orange Lingerie, or plug Space Ponchos.

2383
02:35:52,070 --> 02:35:52,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you do that?

2384
02:35:52,951 --> 02:35:53,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

2385
02:35:54,372 --> 02:35:55,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Space Ponchos.

2386
02:35:55,072 --> 02:35:55,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

2387
02:35:57,426 --> 02:35:57,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Night.

2388
02:35:58,046 --> 02:35:58,286
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2389
02:35:58,706 --> 02:36:01,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations to X-Link, our winner tonight.

2390
02:36:01,707 --> 02:36:02,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Our completely apathetic.

2391
02:36:02,828 --> 02:36:04,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I did mention the prize up front, right?

2392
02:36:04,588 --> 02:36:07,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had like 30 minutes to think about that while that game went on way too long.

2393
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:08,090
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2394
02:36:09,170 --> 02:36:10,971
[SPEAKER_14]: How many listeners did we lose during the match game tonight?

2395
02:36:10,991 --> 02:36:11,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Just out of curiosity.

2396
02:36:11,871 --> 02:36:12,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, we gained some.

2397
02:36:12,711 --> 02:36:12,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

2398
02:36:13,912 --> 02:36:15,832
[SPEAKER_14]: We might have to do the match game every week.

2399
02:36:17,493 --> 02:36:17,753
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2400
02:36:17,893 --> 02:36:20,414
[SPEAKER_04]: They just wanted to hear Space Poncho said over and over again.

2401
02:36:20,434 --> 02:36:21,154
[SPEAKER_14]: They did.

2402
02:36:21,174 --> 02:36:24,815
[SPEAKER_14]: The people that download the podcast tomorrow, it's not going to be funny anymore after tonight.

2403
02:36:25,515 --> 02:36:26,876
[SPEAKER_14]: But now we're going to milk it up for all it's worth.

2404
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:27,550
[SPEAKER_14]: PowerGig

2405
02:36:54,720 --> 02:36:59,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game, you know, which before the whole Rock Band 3 announcement of what exactly they're going to have there.

2406
02:37:00,023 --> 02:37:03,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounded pretty cool and unique, but it will also be out this fall.

2407
02:37:04,125 --> 02:37:11,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Their guitar, of course, is actually going to be an electric guitar, a real electric guitar that also will have fret buttons on it as well.

2408
02:37:11,909 --> 02:37:19,573
[SPEAKER_11]: The real difference between that and, say, the Rock Band guitar is that you can plug this directly into an amp and actually play an electric guitar.

2409
02:37:19,833 --> 02:37:21,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Dave Matthews Band, Kid Rock, Eric Clapton

2410
02:37:36,229 --> 02:37:36,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

2411
02:37:55,843 --> 02:38:03,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironically though, while their guitar may be really cool, they release pics and information about their drum set, which looks like shit.

2412
02:38:03,989 --> 02:38:09,954
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason why it's pretty crappy is because you actually don't hit the drums.

2413
02:38:10,254 --> 02:38:11,955
[SPEAKER_11]: You hit above the drums.

2414
02:38:12,756 --> 02:38:14,417
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like playing air drums, I guess.

2415
02:38:15,718 --> 02:38:18,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is kind of strange.

2416
02:38:21,490 --> 02:38:24,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just excited we're actually going to get to see this game at E3 this year.

2417
02:38:24,853 --> 02:38:27,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Because when they went to PAX, they didn't show anything.

2418
02:38:28,816 --> 02:38:30,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I wish we'd see Scratch there too.

2419
02:38:30,918 --> 02:38:32,179
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be kind of cool.

2420
02:38:32,679 --> 02:38:35,581
[SPEAKER_04]: They might have it for the iPad or iPhone or whatever they were saying.

2421
02:38:36,502 --> 02:38:40,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather see the PC version because that's one that's actually going to be kind of similar to the console release.

2422
02:38:40,866 --> 02:38:41,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2423
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:53,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR It's not open yet, guys.

2424
02:38:54,486 --> 02:38:56,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I like how the calls start coming in instantly.

2425
02:38:56,287 --> 02:38:58,288
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I'm just looking at all the Space Poncho tweets.

2426
02:38:58,308 --> 02:38:59,008
[SPEAKER_14]: It's doing pretty good.

2427
02:39:00,169 --> 02:39:00,869
[SPEAKER_14]: It's doing pretty good.

2428
02:39:01,329 --> 02:39:03,190
[SPEAKER_14]: It's catching on a little more than President Cat, I think.

2429
02:39:03,631 --> 02:39:07,413
[SPEAKER_14]: It might actually... If the World Cup wasn't happening right now, it might trend.

2430
02:39:07,473 --> 02:39:07,893
[SPEAKER_14]: We would see.

2431
02:39:09,686 --> 02:39:10,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see here.

2432
02:39:10,367 --> 02:39:17,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on to one more story, guys, about a new game from the guy who was wearing a space poncho earlier, Itagaki.

2433
02:39:17,733 --> 02:39:18,353
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

2434
02:39:18,573 --> 02:39:19,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

2435
02:39:19,654 --> 02:39:21,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Tomonobu Itagaki.

2436
02:39:21,095 --> 02:39:28,961
[SPEAKER_14]: He's the guy who did Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden, and he's kind of known for, well, tit engines, basically.

2437
02:39:29,042 --> 02:39:30,703
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if you play Dead or Alive.

2438
02:39:30,743 --> 02:39:31,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Tit and blood engines.

2439
02:39:31,724 --> 02:39:32,124
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

2440
02:39:32,164 --> 02:39:32,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Good times.

2441
02:39:32,985 --> 02:39:35,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he left Temco, and now he's at THQ.

2442
02:39:36,407 --> 02:39:38,508
[SPEAKER_14]: And they debuted the game that he is working on.

2443
02:39:38,568 --> 02:39:40,169
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Devil's Third.

2444
02:39:40,649 --> 02:39:42,771
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from his new studio, Valhalla Games.

2445
02:39:42,931 --> 02:39:46,172
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's violence, violence, violence, and gore.

2446
02:39:46,573 --> 02:39:50,515
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's going to be on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

2447
02:39:50,995 --> 02:39:53,876
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is a little trailer that's kind of surfing around the internet right now.

2448
02:39:53,956 --> 02:39:58,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to take a look here at the trailer here for Devil's Third.

2449
02:39:58,719 --> 02:40:00,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to see all the blood and violence in this game.

2450
02:40:07,731 --> 02:40:11,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow, that shotgun made all the limbs explode.

2451
02:40:11,273 --> 02:40:12,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there were chunks coming off.

2452
02:40:12,614 --> 02:40:14,075
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of gross, but funny.

2453
02:40:15,816 --> 02:40:17,197
[SPEAKER_14]: See, this is cartoony.

2454
02:40:18,097 --> 02:40:19,178
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that, the machine gun.

2455
02:40:19,198 --> 02:40:20,439
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like I was flying up the building.

2456
02:40:23,681 --> 02:40:25,201
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't look like a bad game.

2457
02:40:25,261 --> 02:40:26,362
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised.

2458
02:40:26,382 --> 02:40:26,902
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2459
02:40:28,964 --> 02:40:30,685
[SPEAKER_14]: See, there's a girl in this.

2460
02:40:30,765 --> 02:40:32,646
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what the Hey Baby game should have been.

2461
02:40:33,927 --> 02:40:34,387
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is.

2462
02:40:35,973 --> 02:40:38,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The music kind of makes it more fun to watch, too.

2463
02:40:38,715 --> 02:40:39,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, cars exploding.

2464
02:40:39,956 --> 02:40:41,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you could do some great YouTubes to this, I bet.

2465
02:40:43,018 --> 02:40:43,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Devil's Third.

2466
02:40:43,839 --> 02:40:44,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like fun.

2467
02:40:44,819 --> 02:40:45,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet we'll get to play it.

2468
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:46,100
Yay!

2469
02:40:47,061 --> 02:40:48,422
[SPEAKER_04]: And then decide it's not fun.

2470
02:40:49,623 --> 02:40:50,203
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

2471
02:40:50,904 --> 02:40:56,228
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that's going to do it for our regular stories tonight, but we might have some last-minute stories.

2472
02:40:56,788 --> 02:40:57,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2473
02:40:57,448 --> 02:41:03,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if any last-minute stories are on deck, and then we'll get to the Skype line, 877-GAME-OLR, or use the name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2474
02:41:03,953 --> 02:41:05,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, you have some quick stories here?

2475
02:41:05,932 --> 02:41:07,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, nothing pulled up, unfortunately.

2476
02:41:07,393 --> 02:41:09,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, luckily for you, we have a call coming in.

2477
02:41:09,515 --> 02:41:10,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2478
02:41:10,476 --> 02:41:10,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2479
02:41:12,517 --> 02:41:13,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Ray Ayanami.

2480
02:41:13,818 --> 02:41:14,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Ray Ayanami.

2481
02:41:14,799 --> 02:41:15,579
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind tonight?

2482
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:22,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, about the Desmos thing I posted earlier, I'm pretty sure I already posted something like that months ago.

2483
02:41:22,404 --> 02:41:25,867
[SPEAKER_09]: The point I wanted to make was the dialogue that they localized.

2484
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:27,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the screenshots?

2485
02:41:27,661 --> 02:41:29,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you noticed, did you see how all the dialogue was localized?

2486
02:41:29,923 --> 02:41:30,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

2487
02:41:48,689 --> 02:41:55,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, apparently someone posted this on Shmobs4, and people pretty much exploded over it just because of how badly it was done.

2488
02:41:55,111 --> 02:42:01,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it kind of reminds me of how someone would go about dubbing a 4Kids anime.

2489
02:42:04,674 --> 02:42:05,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to get this game, though?

2490
02:42:05,694 --> 02:42:07,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to get the Death Smiles game when it comes out?

2491
02:42:07,675 --> 02:42:09,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I've already pre-ordered it.

2492
02:42:09,455 --> 02:42:14,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the shitty dialogue doesn't stop the game from being any less playable.

2493
02:42:15,518 --> 02:42:45,099
[SPEAKER_09]: but it just worries but I have a slight feeling that some people might remember the game for the dialogue and not for the gameplay but then again it's a shmup and no one really plays the game for a shmup for the dialogue so I guess I'm not all that worried you play for the bullets everywhere let me ask you another question Ray and I'm going to ask this of all the callers tonight so if you're going to call into the show be prepared what are you most looking forward to about E3 next week besides Space Pontius I don't really know I don't really follow all the like

2494
02:42:45,973 --> 02:42:47,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Big name stuff.

2495
02:42:48,415 --> 02:42:49,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm more of an E3 gamer.

2496
02:42:51,437 --> 02:42:52,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well, fair enough.

2497
02:42:53,018 --> 02:42:54,659
[SPEAKER_14]: E3, I guess, isn't a big deal for everybody.

2498
02:42:55,379 --> 02:42:55,839
[SPEAKER_14]: That's alright.

2499
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:57,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Every gamer gets a voice, even when you're wrong.

2500
02:42:57,961 --> 02:42:58,381
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

2501
02:42:58,801 --> 02:42:59,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2502
02:42:59,442 --> 02:43:02,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but do you have any last thoughts for our listeners?

2503
02:43:03,504 --> 02:43:04,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

2504
02:43:04,425 --> 02:43:07,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I got to play Escalude 2 this week.

2505
02:43:08,247 --> 02:43:10,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'll talk about that on another call.

2506
02:43:13,226 --> 02:43:13,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

2507
02:43:13,586 --> 02:43:14,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what'd you think?

2508
02:43:14,807 --> 02:43:16,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us a quick summary of what you thought.

2509
02:43:17,147 --> 02:43:17,787
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fun.

2510
02:43:17,807 --> 02:43:25,750
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like most bullet hell shooters, except being slowdown bullets and among other things.

2511
02:43:28,230 --> 02:43:29,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you like it or pass?

2512
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:36,813
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fun, but I keep holding back from playing the game just because of how difficult it is to play for score.

2513
02:43:37,933 --> 02:43:38,233
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2514
02:43:38,834 --> 02:43:41,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, keep playing and let us know what you think, all right?

2515
02:43:42,297 --> 02:43:42,578
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2516
02:43:42,718 --> 02:43:42,938
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2517
02:43:43,078 --> 02:43:43,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, buddy.

2518
02:43:43,959 --> 02:43:44,299
[SPEAKER_14]: See you.

2519
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:44,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Later.

2520
02:43:44,479 --> 02:43:44,800
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2521
02:43:45,580 --> 02:43:48,123
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to get some more calls here on the Skype line.

2522
02:43:48,143 --> 02:43:48,883
[SPEAKER_14]: 877-GAME-OLR.

2523
02:43:49,024 --> 02:43:51,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2524
02:43:51,346 --> 02:43:52,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get to another call.

2525
02:43:52,507 --> 02:43:53,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2526
02:43:53,528 --> 02:43:53,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2527
02:43:57,472 --> 02:43:57,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello.

2528
02:43:57,872 --> 02:43:58,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Hola.

2529
02:43:58,573 --> 02:44:00,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

2530
02:44:00,454 --> 02:44:00,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Quienes?

2531
02:44:02,867 --> 02:44:04,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-oh, we have a bad call.

2532
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:09,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember, call Echo 123 before you call Orange Lounge Radio.

2533
02:44:09,214 --> 02:44:11,777
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good way to test your connection to make sure it works.

2534
02:44:12,939 --> 02:44:14,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2535
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:14,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2536
02:44:15,677 --> 02:44:16,578
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Scarzo.

2537
02:44:16,598 --> 02:44:17,418
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, Rob?

2538
02:44:17,498 --> 02:44:19,339
[SPEAKER_14]: What is up, Scarzo?

2539
02:44:19,419 --> 02:44:20,440
[SPEAKER_14]: What is on your mind, buddy?

2540
02:44:21,540 --> 02:44:24,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to tell Miklatov, you know, I jumped in my GMC DeLorean.

2541
02:44:24,742 --> 02:44:26,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought I saw him on Friday night.

2542
02:44:26,423 --> 02:44:29,164
[SPEAKER_12]: I totally forgot to post that on the chat line.

2543
02:44:29,745 --> 02:44:35,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw somebody who was actually kind of bummed out about DJ Max Technica being down on Friday night.

2544
02:44:35,808 --> 02:44:37,589
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys were there on Saturday, right?

2545
02:44:37,689 --> 02:44:39,830
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just you, Miklatov.

2546
02:44:39,870 --> 02:44:44,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I could imagine that a lot of people would be upset about that because it's supposed to be a really, really good game.

2547
02:44:44,935 --> 02:44:50,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me tell you, Mikotov, straight up, dude, because Roosevelt Golf Land, Rob, go ahead and fill in your input.

2548
02:44:51,077 --> 02:44:52,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Roosevelt Golf Land is crap, by the way.

2549
02:44:53,357 --> 02:44:54,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the problem.

2550
02:44:54,538 --> 02:44:56,418
[SPEAKER_12]: They had a problem with the hard drive.

2551
02:44:56,918 --> 02:44:58,859
[SPEAKER_12]: This was when I started playing back in December.

2552
02:44:59,459 --> 02:45:01,019
[SPEAKER_12]: They were getting a lot of blue screen of dev.

2553
02:45:01,059 --> 02:45:02,079
[SPEAKER_12]: The game was lagging.

2554
02:45:02,120 --> 02:45:03,040
[SPEAKER_12]: It was slowing down.

2555
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:03,860
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just horrible.

2556
02:45:03,920 --> 02:45:07,561
[SPEAKER_12]: So the problem was they would just have to restart it, and I can just keep going.

2557
02:45:08,342 --> 02:45:12,446
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't until like maybe a month ago where it just blue screened.

2558
02:45:12,806 --> 02:45:17,191
[SPEAKER_12]: They would restart it because they know I'm the regular over there and I will always play during Arcade Mania.

2559
02:45:17,672 --> 02:45:19,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like Friday, Saturday nights after I get off work.

2560
02:45:20,435 --> 02:45:22,857
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem was it runs on Windows XP, by the way.

2561
02:45:23,338 --> 02:45:25,901
[SPEAKER_12]: It starts up and it says that the program cannot start.

2562
02:45:26,670 --> 02:45:28,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I like it about a thousand million times better.

2563
02:45:45,259 --> 02:45:48,860
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to remember Miklatov is totally biased and partial towards Korean music.

2564
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:50,841
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very true.

2565
02:45:50,941 --> 02:45:53,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you try to get it in DDR here in America?

2566
02:45:53,102 --> 02:45:53,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Korean stuff?

2567
02:45:53,802 --> 02:45:54,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2568
02:45:54,122 --> 02:45:54,362
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2569
02:45:54,882 --> 02:45:55,903
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you tried to do that.

2570
02:45:55,963 --> 02:45:56,743
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that would be cool.

2571
02:45:56,803 --> 02:45:57,423
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.

2572
02:45:57,763 --> 02:45:58,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I might have.

2573
02:45:58,384 --> 02:45:59,084
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember.

2574
02:45:59,164 --> 02:46:01,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how much I'm allowed to talk about.

2575
02:46:02,746 --> 02:46:06,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's assume, let's hypothesize you got to actually suggest songs for inclusion in the game.

2576
02:46:07,189 --> 02:46:08,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't you have written down a bunch of Korean songs?

2577
02:46:09,130 --> 02:46:13,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might have, but I was more always leaning towards 90s music.

2578
02:46:14,114 --> 02:46:18,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Because who wouldn't want to do like, you know, Rhythm is a Dancer.

2579
02:46:19,078 --> 02:46:20,879
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it all ended up in Hardest Party, and I was like...

2580
02:46:20,919 --> 02:46:21,079
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Maxx

2581
02:46:38,357 --> 02:46:42,301
[SPEAKER_04]: and I swear I played that for like eight hours straight because it was just that much fun.

2582
02:46:42,341 --> 02:46:48,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you've got mission mode, you've got, you know, really good songs and, you know, it's worth it.

2583
02:46:49,027 --> 02:46:52,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really throw my support too much behind the American version.

2584
02:46:53,051 --> 02:46:53,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It was decent.

2585
02:46:54,672 --> 02:46:55,252
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Maxx Fever

2586
02:47:21,199 --> 02:47:49,501
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not a terrible game it's just there were a lot of problems with it that they have not released an update to fix but you know you get some of the best songs from the first two games in it definitely if you can get it for like I don't know 10 or 15 bucks that's worth it I wouldn't pay more than more than 15 for it though okay and did you hear about the Technica 2 soundtrack being leaked because I can't find that yet and that's a tough one just the limited edition version

2587
02:47:50,399 --> 02:47:58,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's on a Korean website because I'm friends with some of the Sunnyvale Golf Line players because that's where most of the top score, the elitist players are.

2588
02:47:59,203 --> 02:48:04,005
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of them got their hands on it and they were telling me about it and I was just like, man, I gotta look for that.

2589
02:48:04,325 --> 02:48:13,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought through a website the limited edition Technica soundtrack that came with the card and the keychain and the soundtrack.

2590
02:48:14,689 --> 02:48:20,232
[SPEAKER_04]: and I actually have it with me too because it's a good card holder and I knew I'd get my hands on some of the Technica 1 cards.

2591
02:48:21,233 --> 02:48:23,794
[SPEAKER_04]: The soundtrack is crap though.

2592
02:48:23,954 --> 02:48:25,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I was hearing mixed reviews.

2593
02:48:25,415 --> 02:48:26,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong.

2594
02:48:26,295 --> 02:48:27,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the music.

2595
02:48:27,095 --> 02:48:28,396
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something new for my ears.

2596
02:48:28,876 --> 02:48:30,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't get me wrong.

2597
02:48:30,437 --> 02:48:31,157
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to give it a shot.

2598
02:48:31,197 --> 02:48:32,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Technica has way better music.

2599
02:48:32,458 --> 02:48:38,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Technica 1 and at least when Technica 2, if it's not already out for real, it will have most of that Technica 1 music on it.

2600
02:48:39,681 --> 02:48:41,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, definitely.

2601
02:48:41,562 --> 02:48:44,563
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to jump in here because I do have to wrap up and get to other calls, but I like this caller.

2602
02:48:44,603 --> 02:48:45,203
[SPEAKER_14]: He's got energy.

2603
02:48:45,263 --> 02:48:45,723
[SPEAKER_14]: He's local.

2604
02:48:45,763 --> 02:48:46,523
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows what he's talking about.

2605
02:48:46,723 --> 02:48:49,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and I can talk about DJ Max, and that's something I can do for hours.

2606
02:48:50,024 --> 02:48:51,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and so if I don't jump in here, that won't happen.

2607
02:48:51,905 --> 02:48:54,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Rob, this is your boy, Jay Hugo, on Twitter, by the way.

2608
02:48:54,206 --> 02:48:55,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Not trying to put a plug.

2609
02:48:55,186 --> 02:48:55,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't follow me.

2610
02:48:55,906 --> 02:48:56,466
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

2611
02:48:56,526 --> 02:48:58,047
[SPEAKER_12]: This is your boy, Jay Hugo, okay?

2612
02:48:58,167 --> 02:48:58,407
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2613
02:48:58,467 --> 02:49:02,428
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I appreciate it, and one of these days, if I actually go to Roseville Golf Land again, although you missed it.

2614
02:49:02,468 --> 02:49:03,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I was there Saturday.

2615
02:49:03,428 --> 02:49:04,048
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll meet up.

2616
02:49:04,229 --> 02:49:05,509
[SPEAKER_14]: What was I going to say?

2617
02:49:05,569 --> 02:49:07,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm asking all the callers this.

2618
02:49:07,430 --> 02:49:08,830
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you looking forward to at E3 this year?

2619
02:49:10,057 --> 02:49:13,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Man, you know, okay, like, I'm not a big, I don't play fighters, but I love watching it.

2620
02:49:14,081 --> 02:49:15,443
[SPEAKER_12]: It feels like a competitive movie.

2621
02:49:15,823 --> 02:49:17,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Marvel vs. Capcom, I got a bunch of friends.

2622
02:49:18,346 --> 02:49:19,928
[SPEAKER_12]: That looks pretty cool, in my opinion.

2623
02:49:20,188 --> 02:49:25,113
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I would go, if I could go to E3 with you, I'd be there for the bukkake, but you know, that's another radio show.

2624
02:49:25,293 --> 02:49:25,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can't be

2625
02:49:26,034 --> 02:49:27,735
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

2626
02:49:28,815 --> 02:49:31,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure you want that to be put in the podcast?

2627
02:49:31,416 --> 02:49:32,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2628
02:49:32,676 --> 02:49:33,377
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

2629
02:49:33,457 --> 02:49:34,117
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

2630
02:49:34,297 --> 02:49:35,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can go bleep me out.

2631
02:49:35,797 --> 02:49:36,478
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying.

2632
02:49:36,498 --> 02:49:36,958
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, it's funny.

2633
02:49:36,998 --> 02:49:37,258
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

2634
02:49:37,598 --> 02:49:37,878
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2635
02:49:38,678 --> 02:49:39,138
[SPEAKER_12]: I like him.

2636
02:49:39,179 --> 02:49:39,639
[SPEAKER_14]: He's funny.

2637
02:49:39,679 --> 02:49:41,799
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to have to get him on the show at some point.

2638
02:49:41,819 --> 02:49:42,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2639
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:45,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish he would be there and the Technica machine would be working.

2640
02:49:45,221 --> 02:49:46,381
[SPEAKER_04]: We could always have a good time.

2641
02:49:47,102 --> 02:49:50,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, one quick thing, Platinum Crew is great.

2642
02:49:50,748 --> 02:49:54,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Technica 2, dual mixing, blah blah blah, the interface is a little weird.

2643
02:49:55,076 --> 02:49:56,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love that interface for 2.

2644
02:49:56,779 --> 02:49:57,560
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks so nice.

2645
02:49:58,556 --> 02:49:58,756
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

2646
02:49:58,836 --> 02:49:59,356
[SPEAKER_12]: It's beautiful.

2647
02:49:59,576 --> 02:50:03,538
[SPEAKER_12]: But not as hot as the classicalized singer, the female, when she had long hair, though.

2648
02:50:03,578 --> 02:50:04,418
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I got to say.

2649
02:50:04,738 --> 02:50:07,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Coming soon is going to be a new podcast, apparently.

2650
02:50:07,739 --> 02:50:09,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Ironically, a music game podcast with these two.

2651
02:50:09,660 --> 02:50:11,221
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just going to talk for hours about it.

2652
02:50:11,421 --> 02:50:12,001
[SPEAKER_14]: I could do it.

2653
02:50:12,401 --> 02:50:13,462
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2654
02:50:13,522 --> 02:50:14,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you go.

2655
02:50:14,682 --> 02:50:15,202
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you go.

2656
02:50:15,262 --> 02:50:16,243
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you guys go.

2657
02:50:16,483 --> 02:50:17,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good night.

2658
02:50:17,143 --> 02:50:17,863
[SPEAKER_12]: First time calling.

2659
02:50:17,903 --> 02:50:19,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for everything.

2660
02:50:19,584 --> 02:50:21,845
[SPEAKER_12]: And, man, I've been missing out on the last eight years, but I'm here now.

2661
02:50:22,185 --> 02:50:23,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's keep it going, guys.

2662
02:50:23,205 --> 02:50:24,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Glad to have you, buddy.

2663
02:50:24,486 --> 02:50:25,086
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a good one.

2664
02:50:26,046 --> 02:50:26,586
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a good guy.

2665
02:50:26,646 --> 02:50:28,907
[SPEAKER_14]: He always pimps our show on the Twitter and stuff.

2666
02:50:28,927 --> 02:50:30,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't think I don't notice that stuff.

2667
02:50:30,027 --> 02:50:30,907
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate that.

2668
02:50:31,168 --> 02:50:32,428
[SPEAKER_14]: He's very enthusiastic about the show.

2669
02:50:32,448 --> 02:50:33,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take another call from him.

2670
02:50:33,648 --> 02:50:34,508
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate it.

2671
02:50:34,628 --> 02:50:36,389
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we've got to get to more other calls.

2672
02:50:36,949 --> 02:50:40,930
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, guys, I know you think I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's E3.

2673
02:50:41,090 --> 02:50:44,391
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't control when there is breaking news.

2674
02:50:45,131 --> 02:50:45,151
E3

2675
02:50:52,967 --> 02:51:08,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Tom Brokaw here, Bukake, anyway, no, what I really wanted to point out was that it has been revealed that there is a Star Wars game, we mentioned this before, there is a Star Wars game for Kinect, and it has been announced it will feature controller-free lightsaber fighting.

2676
02:51:10,088 --> 02:51:11,148
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, how does that work?

2677
02:51:11,168 --> 02:51:11,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

2678
02:51:11,849 --> 02:51:12,509
[SPEAKER_14]: But here's the thing.

2679
02:51:12,589 --> 02:51:14,649
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to love Microsoft.

2680
02:51:15,169 --> 02:51:16,090
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to love them.

2681
02:51:16,130 --> 02:51:18,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you can hate them, but you've got to love them.

2682
02:51:18,930 --> 02:51:23,711
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't even make it a secret that they just rip off other people's ideas and make it better.

2683
02:51:24,012 --> 02:51:27,872
[SPEAKER_14]: What is everybody wanted on the Wii since the first day people put their hands on the controller?

2684
02:51:28,433 --> 02:51:29,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Lightsaber battles.

2685
02:51:29,673 --> 02:51:30,713
[SPEAKER_14]: But is it going to be better?

2686
02:51:30,733 --> 02:51:32,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you won't have anything in your hands.

2687
02:51:32,514 --> 02:51:33,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the videos for...

2688
02:51:34,634 --> 02:51:38,715
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just gonna find a random object, like, I don't know, like a pie roller.

2689
02:51:38,755 --> 02:51:41,536
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to Kotaku right now, their top story there is showing the space ponchos, and they have video.

2690
02:51:54,019 --> 02:51:54,419
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that?

2691
02:51:54,439 --> 02:51:55,100
[SPEAKER_11]: This is creepy.

2692
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:55,840
[SPEAKER_14]: They're plant people.

2693
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:56,500
[SPEAKER_14]: They're moving...

2694
02:52:23,237 --> 02:52:25,259
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck does this have to do with video games?

2695
02:52:25,279 --> 02:52:26,900
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we have to go tomorrow.

2696
02:52:32,265 --> 02:52:35,428
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just... They're plant people.

2697
02:52:36,969 --> 02:52:38,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought there was going to be video of the Space Ponchos.

2698
02:52:38,571 --> 02:52:39,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought so too.

2699
02:52:39,471 --> 02:52:39,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the plant people.

2700
02:52:39,992 --> 02:52:41,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck the plant people.

2701
02:52:41,053 --> 02:52:42,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's bald dude in the Space Poncho?

2702
02:52:42,454 --> 02:52:42,954
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

2703
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:58,701
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotta be really hot with all those people wearing those silvery space ponchos.

2704
02:52:58,741 --> 02:53:02,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if you can go on YouTube.

2705
02:53:02,783 --> 02:53:03,584
[SPEAKER_14]: I love commenters.

2706
02:53:03,624 --> 02:53:06,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I was wondering if YouTube has some space poncho.

2707
02:53:06,885 --> 02:53:07,866
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they'd be on Twitter.

2708
02:53:08,366 --> 02:53:13,348
[SPEAKER_14]: I know our boy Bobby Blackwolf is monitoring the Twitters right now.

2709
02:53:14,689 --> 02:53:17,150
[SPEAKER_14]: And he will let us know the incident of space poncho.

2710
02:53:17,170 --> 02:53:18,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he's trying to get the space poncho thing to trend.

2711
02:53:19,051 --> 02:53:19,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Rob.

2712
02:53:19,611 --> 02:53:19,811
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2713
02:53:19,851 --> 02:53:21,433
[SPEAKER_02]: SpacePacho5.

2714
02:53:23,915 --> 02:53:24,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

2715
02:53:24,276 --> 02:53:26,037
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, comments from chat room here.

2716
02:53:26,137 --> 02:53:30,902
[SPEAKER_14]: BlackWolf has apparently also read it as an on-rails lightsaber game.

2717
02:53:31,563 --> 02:53:31,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Weird.

2718
02:53:33,991 --> 02:53:37,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about Star Wars, it's whatever

2719
02:54:01,997 --> 02:54:02,978
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2720
02:54:17,293 --> 02:54:19,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Project Under $100 is back on.

2721
02:54:19,474 --> 02:54:31,740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically, as I put it, an experiment in frugality and engineering that's basically going to be tasked in building a working MAME machine.

2722
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:37,282
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a PC in an arcade cabinet with arcade controls under $100.

2723
02:54:37,322 --> 02:54:37,602
[SPEAKER_11]: That's easy.

2724
02:54:40,089 --> 02:54:41,090
[SPEAKER_11]: You would think it would be.

2725
02:54:41,631 --> 02:54:42,031
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

2726
02:54:58,411 --> 02:55:02,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Buying everything for under $100, a lot harder than it sounds.

2727
02:55:02,337 --> 02:55:04,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So donations don't count towards your under $100.

2728
02:55:04,319 --> 02:55:05,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Donations do not count.

2729
02:55:06,102 --> 02:55:07,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything must be purchased.

2730
02:55:08,365 --> 02:55:14,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Except, of course, construction materials like tape or glue and that kind of stuff.

2731
02:55:14,313 --> 02:55:15,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming that you have that.

2732
02:55:15,475 --> 02:55:18,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say in my backyard I have an empty arcade cabinet.

2733
02:55:18,438 --> 02:55:20,981
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a ton of controllers and buttons.

2734
02:55:21,021 --> 02:55:21,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes.

2735
02:55:21,922 --> 02:55:23,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's worst case scenario.

2736
02:55:23,684 --> 02:55:27,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you wanted to and you didn't have anything, could you do it under $100?

2737
02:55:27,869 --> 02:55:29,230
[SPEAKER_11]: And the answer is yes.

2738
02:55:29,430 --> 02:55:30,331
[SPEAKER_14]: I gotta get back to the phones.

2739
02:55:30,371 --> 02:55:31,793
[SPEAKER_14]: They are blowing up, you guys.

2740
02:55:31,813 --> 02:55:32,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you give out the URL?

2741
02:55:33,126 --> 02:55:59,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, the URL is under $100 $100 is the number under$100mame.blogspot.com There'll be a link on Orange Lounge later By the way guys, we need a Space Poncho page on Wikipedia, like right now and get it created and then link it to all of us before On our wiki I would think official Wikipedia should have Space Poncho Both Let's get to another call, we gotta try and blow through these calls Our phone lines are blowing up tonight Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2742
02:56:00,091 --> 02:56:00,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, this is Ingo.

2743
02:56:01,233 --> 02:56:02,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Ingo, what's on your mind?

[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we can hear you this time.

02:56:04,637 --> 02:56:06,199
[SPEAKER_13]: I want a space poncho.

2747
02:56:06,259 --> 02:56:06,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too!

2748
02:56:07,942 --> 02:56:09,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Sadly, I have to work tomorrow.

2749
02:56:09,343 --> 02:56:10,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Boo hoo.

2750
02:56:10,565 --> 02:56:11,486
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you're sick?

2751
02:56:12,528 --> 02:56:12,928
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

2752
02:56:12,948 --> 02:56:16,153
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell is going on with these Microsoft pictures?

2753
02:56:16,173 --> 02:56:17,695
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like cavemen that are emo.

2754
02:56:19,195 --> 02:56:21,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, cavemen that are emo, Microsoft?

2755
02:56:21,437 --> 02:56:23,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you talking about the pictures from the event, or what?

2756
02:56:23,358 --> 02:56:29,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's the one where they're like, it's like on a hill, and they're like, there's the big ol' logo there, and there's a TV or something.

2757
02:56:29,823 --> 02:56:32,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Cirque du Soleil is like that modern art thing, you know?

2758
02:56:32,726 --> 02:56:35,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't you be emo if you didn't have fire?

2759
02:56:37,229 --> 02:57:06,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be emo if my space poncho wasn't changing colors like it's supposed to imagine if the space ponchos glowed blue you're just giving me more reason to make you call in sick tomorrow not calling in sick tomorrow what else was I going to say what do you most want to see at E3 Ingo Medal of Honor and Power Gig do you know any rumors about these different series and where they're going I think Medal of Honor is going to blow Modern Warfare 2 out of the water

2760
02:57:07,006 --> 02:57:08,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, them's fighting words.

2761
02:57:08,247 --> 02:57:08,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is that?

2762
02:57:09,667 --> 02:57:12,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's... I don't know.

2763
02:57:13,449 --> 02:57:14,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it looks awesome.

2764
02:57:14,630 --> 02:57:16,250
[SPEAKER_13]: And the guy looks like ZZ Top.

2765
02:57:18,652 --> 02:57:19,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there's a good reason right there.

2766
02:57:20,713 --> 02:57:21,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

2767
02:57:21,613 --> 02:57:27,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know, I hope you enjoy E3 and all the news that's coming out of it and get some stuff.

2768
02:57:27,556 --> 02:57:29,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything else you wanted to share with our listeners tonight?

2769
02:57:29,837 --> 02:57:30,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an announcement.

2770
02:57:30,917 --> 02:57:31,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2771
02:57:31,238 --> 02:57:33,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I officially quit Infinity Ward.

2772
02:57:34,219 --> 02:57:35,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my gosh.

2773
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:36,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, did you work for Infinity Ward?

2774
02:57:36,997 --> 02:57:37,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2775
02:57:37,678 --> 02:57:38,059
[SPEAKER_13]: You did?

2776
02:57:38,779 --> 02:57:39,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2777
02:57:39,561 --> 02:57:40,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know that.

2778
02:57:40,201 --> 02:57:40,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

2779
02:57:40,522 --> 02:57:42,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't know we had listeners of Infinity Ward listening to this show.

2780
02:57:44,047 --> 02:57:44,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, okay.

2781
02:57:45,849 --> 02:57:50,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I work for a different developer that I don't want to talk about.

2782
02:57:50,996 --> 02:57:54,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we ask you why you quit Infinity Ward, or is it one of those, like, it ought to be obvious, Rob?

2783
02:57:56,121 --> 02:57:56,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of.

2784
02:57:56,942 --> 02:57:59,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Pre-shift contract on Activision's side.

2785
02:58:00,182 --> 02:58:00,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

2786
02:58:00,883 --> 02:58:01,203
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2787
02:58:01,743 --> 02:58:02,283
[SPEAKER_14]: How about that?

2788
02:58:02,363 --> 02:58:03,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I had no idea.

2789
02:58:03,823 --> 02:58:04,124
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2790
02:58:04,164 --> 02:58:08,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, good luck to you on your new endeavors, whatever they may be.

2791
02:58:08,405 --> 02:58:09,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Will we see you at E3?

2792
02:58:09,205 --> 02:58:10,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to be at E3?

2793
02:58:10,585 --> 02:58:12,026
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because they don't let programmers really go.

2794
02:58:12,046 --> 02:58:12,506
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably.

2795
02:58:13,266 --> 02:58:13,826
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be there.

2796
02:58:14,006 --> 02:58:15,347
[SPEAKER_13]: You just probably won't see me.

2797
02:58:16,347 --> 02:58:17,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well, okay then.

2798
02:58:17,547 --> 02:58:17,807
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2799
02:58:18,748 --> 02:58:20,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, say hello if you do happen to see us, all right?

2800
02:58:20,948 --> 02:58:21,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2801
02:58:21,388 --> 02:58:21,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

2802
02:58:21,788 --> 02:58:22,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good E3.

2803
02:58:23,129 --> 02:58:23,389
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

2804
02:58:23,949 --> 02:58:24,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2805
02:58:25,750 --> 02:58:26,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Who knew?

2806
02:58:26,130 --> 02:58:28,652
[SPEAKER_14]: How often were we covering those Infinity Ward stories?

2807
02:58:28,692 --> 02:58:30,693
[SPEAKER_14]: We had somebody listening who worked on it.

2808
02:58:31,053 --> 02:58:31,593
[SPEAKER_14]: You never know.

2809
02:58:34,155 --> 02:58:35,716
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I really hate to do this to you.

2810
02:58:36,196 --> 02:58:39,898
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hate to do it, but at the same time, it's E3, guys.

2811
02:58:40,598 --> 02:58:41,219
[SPEAKER_14]: What now?

2812
02:58:52,430 --> 02:58:57,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently SingStar has a new game that is being revealed at E3.

2813
02:58:57,374 --> 02:59:00,716
[SPEAKER_14]: It is called SingStar Dance.

2814
02:59:01,536 --> 02:59:04,919
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's being revealed at Sony's press conference on Tuesday morning.

2815
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:08,721
[SPEAKER_14]: It's supposedly compatible with the PS3 Move controllers.

2816
02:59:08,761 --> 02:59:09,922
[SPEAKER_14]: SingStar Dance.

2817
02:59:10,022 --> 02:59:11,883
[SPEAKER_14]: News is leaking out about that tonight.

2818
02:59:11,963 --> 02:59:16,346
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to hold the microphone and the Move controllers in your hand, how is that going to work?

2819
02:59:16,426 --> 02:59:17,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you actually sing.

2820
02:59:17,587 --> 02:59:18,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just a dance game.

2821
02:59:18,688 --> 02:59:19,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Call it out.

2822
02:59:19,088 --> 02:59:21,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a SingStar title.

2823
02:59:22,431 --> 02:59:23,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2824
02:59:23,612 --> 02:59:23,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2825
02:59:24,935 --> 02:59:27,779
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the Space Poncho-less SSJ100 Matt.

2826
02:59:27,819 --> 02:59:30,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt, our Space Poncho-loving friend.

2827
02:59:30,544 --> 02:59:31,245
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2828
02:59:32,332 --> 02:59:32,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

2829
02:59:33,512 --> 02:59:41,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I quickly want to get your guys' thoughts on, you know, I have a feeling that this E3, they're going to be ramming the 3D gaming down our throats.

2830
02:59:41,995 --> 02:59:42,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2831
02:59:42,375 --> 02:59:43,275
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think?

2832
02:59:44,035 --> 02:59:48,817
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it can go suck my dick because I am not a big fan of E3.

2833
02:59:49,497 --> 02:59:50,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

2834
02:59:51,798 --> 02:59:52,638
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to get cut.

2835
02:59:52,998 --> 02:59:54,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a big fan of E3.

2836
02:59:54,380 --> 02:59:54,820
[SPEAKER_14]: I love them.

2837
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:56,262
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 3D.

2838
02:59:56,362 --> 03:00:00,206
[SPEAKER_14]: I am not a big fan of it because it makes me sick when it gets to that level.

2839
03:00:00,286 --> 03:00:03,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Like watching Avatar in the theater for like two hours and all that.

2840
03:00:04,551 --> 03:00:08,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I think all these games are just too much.

2841
03:00:09,915 --> 03:00:13,179
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it if I have to buy a new TV and glasses for it.

2842
03:00:13,579 --> 03:00:20,407
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I will probably support the 3DS because it's all built in and I won't have a problem with that.

2843
03:00:20,427 --> 03:00:21,888
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to buy updates to games.

2844
03:00:21,908 --> 03:00:23,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to buy special glasses.

2845
03:00:23,150 --> 03:00:24,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a $2,000 TV.

2846
03:00:24,151 --> 03:00:27,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want a $2,000 TV, but I don't want it for that reason.

2847
03:00:29,076 --> 03:00:56,826
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm extremely apprehensive about the 3DS but I will check it out and give it a fair shot and may I be wrong I will come out on the show Tuesday night you'll know I will post the little Rob Roberts and pals at E3 and if I'm wrong I will say I was wrong this thing is awesome if they have a Pokemon game I'm sold if you want to blame anyone for this whole 3D thing you gotta blame the TV makers because everyone now is buying everyone pretty much has an HDTV I don't know the exact numbers household wise but

2848
03:00:58,054 --> 03:01:02,296
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to try to crank out new hardware, new stuff for people to buy.

2849
03:01:02,656 --> 03:01:06,018
[SPEAKER_04]: The HD TVs and 3D TVs are completely different.

2850
03:01:06,539 --> 03:01:15,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, but everyone pretty much has an HD TV now, so they're trying to get people to get the new upgrade, the new tech.

2851
03:01:16,084 --> 03:01:16,645
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

2852
03:01:16,685 --> 03:01:18,486
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm turning this on you, SSJ100Mal.

2853
03:01:18,506 --> 03:01:19,727
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think of 3D games?

2854
03:01:21,428 --> 03:01:25,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it could work, but I don't think now is the proper time.

2855
03:01:26,453 --> 03:01:27,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Now is too early.

2856
03:01:27,354 --> 03:01:28,715
[SPEAKER_14]: This is all happening too fast.

2857
03:01:28,795 --> 03:01:31,637
[SPEAKER_14]: The movies are one thing and then the rest is just too much.

2858
03:01:32,197 --> 03:01:32,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Too much.

2859
03:01:32,518 --> 03:01:39,102
[SPEAKER_08]: And when our economy is a little more stable, when we're able to be a little more frugal to go out and spend these $3,000 TVs with $150...

2860
03:01:43,450 --> 03:02:02,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll look into it but you know right now very little TV is 3D now I mean I know ESPN has jumped on it I know different sports are doing it but you know it's just too early let me ask you this real quick what thing at E3 are you looking forward to the most?

2861
03:02:04,346 --> 03:02:09,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Microsoft to give us more games for live you know like 1 vs 100

2862
03:02:11,263 --> 03:02:12,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are those games?

2863
03:02:12,444 --> 03:02:13,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, whatever happened to that?

2864
03:02:14,145 --> 03:02:15,466
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I want to see?

2865
03:02:15,506 --> 03:02:16,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see them do Match Game.

2866
03:02:17,428 --> 03:02:18,509
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love Match Game.

2867
03:02:18,529 --> 03:02:19,550
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be amazing.

2868
03:02:19,650 --> 03:02:20,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Match with thousands of people.

2869
03:02:20,410 --> 03:02:28,237
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing we need to do is just hook up a couple of Xbox 360 Slims and revive Charles Nelson Reilly.

2870
03:02:28,757 --> 03:02:29,898
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, that would be wonderful.

2871
03:02:29,918 --> 03:02:31,139
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be great.

2872
03:02:31,479 --> 03:02:37,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, as of today, we're going to let you go so we can get at least one more call here on this long-running show tonight, but thanks so much for your call.

2873
03:02:37,924 --> 03:02:38,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

2874
03:02:38,305 --> 03:02:38,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one, buddy.

2875
03:02:40,408 --> 03:02:41,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess the Kinect event is over.

2876
03:02:41,929 --> 03:02:42,870
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what Black Wolf says.

2877
03:02:43,010 --> 03:02:44,131
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what happened.

2878
03:02:44,651 --> 03:02:46,573
[SPEAKER_14]: People probably just walked out.

2879
03:02:47,153 --> 03:02:48,394
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they walked out.

2880
03:02:48,955 --> 03:02:50,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Did it blow people's minds?

2881
03:02:50,676 --> 03:02:51,337
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I want to know.

2882
03:02:51,377 --> 03:02:53,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it a mind-blowing experience?

2883
03:02:54,999 --> 03:02:56,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Were your minds blown?

2884
03:02:58,662 --> 03:02:59,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Last call of the night.

2885
03:02:59,423 --> 03:03:00,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2886
03:03:00,424 --> 03:03:00,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

2887
03:03:01,965 --> 03:03:07,109
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'd rather walk around and wear a space poncho throughout Manhattan than play Final Fantasy VIII again.

2888
03:03:08,351 --> 03:03:09,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Amen to that.

2889
03:03:09,953 --> 03:03:10,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.

2890
03:03:10,833 --> 03:03:11,434
[SPEAKER_14]: I do both.

2891
03:03:11,674 --> 03:03:11,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

2892
03:03:12,455 --> 03:03:12,735
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2893
03:03:13,035 --> 03:03:15,417
[SPEAKER_14]: What is on your mind tonight, Ranma?

2894
03:03:17,139 --> 03:03:19,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make this quick because I know you guys are running late.

2895
03:03:19,421 --> 03:03:25,246
[SPEAKER_10]: About a few weeks back, I finally got my hands on Beatles Rock Band and Guitar Hero Van Halen.

2896
03:03:27,427 --> 03:03:27,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2897
03:03:28,188 --> 03:03:30,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So first tell us about Beatles Rock Band.

2898
03:03:31,551 --> 03:03:33,473
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only played a couple of tracks of it and...

2899
03:03:34,514 --> 03:03:38,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, my personal opinion, I would not have paid $59.

2900
03:03:38,435 --> 03:03:41,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have paid $39 or $49 for it.

2901
03:03:41,796 --> 03:03:44,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, I got it on clearance for $9.99 at Target.

2902
03:03:47,057 --> 03:03:47,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm, okay.

2903
03:03:48,378 --> 03:03:50,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, $9.99 for Beatles?

2904
03:03:50,698 --> 03:03:53,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, select stores at the time were clearing them out.

2905
03:03:53,199 --> 03:03:54,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm walking in, just checking what they had.

2906
03:03:55,259 --> 03:03:57,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Van Halen for $15 on clearance.

2907
03:03:57,660 --> 03:04:00,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked over and saw Beatles for $10, so I grabbed that too.

2908
03:04:03,852 --> 03:04:04,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

2909
03:04:04,793 --> 03:04:10,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, and you like the game or it's kind of one of those, well, I'm really happy I didn't pay $60 for this.

2910
03:04:11,421 --> 03:04:17,287
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really glad I didn't pay $60 for either game because I was really hyped for Guitar Hero Van Halen.

2911
03:04:17,347 --> 03:04:18,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I really was.

2912
03:04:18,328 --> 03:04:20,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I started playing through it and I'm like...

2913
03:04:21,195 --> 03:04:22,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not so hyped anymore.

2914
03:04:23,356 --> 03:04:28,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And the one thing that pissed me off is that I'm halfway through the game with the drums.

2915
03:04:29,018 --> 03:04:32,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I figured, let me finish up the other half of the game on guitar.

2916
03:04:32,820 --> 03:04:36,122
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I have to go through everything all over again with the guitar.

2917
03:04:36,782 --> 03:04:38,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, screw this.

2918
03:04:39,683 --> 03:04:40,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

2919
03:04:41,284 --> 03:04:41,564
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2920
03:04:42,444 --> 03:04:44,325
[SPEAKER_14]: What about Van Halen, Guitar Hero?

2921
03:04:45,126 --> 03:04:46,706
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one I was talking about.

2922
03:04:46,986 --> 03:04:47,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

2923
03:04:47,587 --> 03:04:48,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

2924
03:04:49,483 --> 03:04:53,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still hoping that one of my favorite songs is in the game, but I don't think it is.

2925
03:04:53,164 --> 03:04:55,785
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just enjoyed the music.

2926
03:04:55,825 --> 03:04:58,206
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the main reason why I got it in the first place.

2927
03:04:58,746 --> 03:05:04,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, I think Activision really needs to step their game up because we just got Green Day Rock Band and well...

2928
03:05:06,531 --> 03:05:11,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really liking that a lot more and I think that's how you really need to do the expansion titles, more like that.

2929
03:05:12,194 --> 03:05:24,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of having practically all the songs unlocked and all you're doing is unlocking venues and so forth, start out with six or seven songs and start unlocking all the songs as you play.

2930
03:05:28,724 --> 03:05:30,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you play the Green Day Rock Band by chance yet?

2931
03:05:32,014 --> 03:05:33,195
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we have it here.

2932
03:05:33,595 --> 03:05:35,035
[SPEAKER_10]: My roommate picked it up last week.

2933
03:05:35,215 --> 03:05:36,316
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to line up an interview.

2934
03:05:36,336 --> 03:05:41,918
[SPEAKER_14]: If I've seen out of it, I'm trying to line up an interview for the last part of the show here, so I'm half listening and half doing this.

2935
03:05:42,518 --> 03:05:44,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry if I'm the only one engaging our caller right now.

2936
03:05:44,999 --> 03:05:47,300
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a caller?

2937
03:05:47,480 --> 03:05:53,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Before this is over, I want to throw in my two cents on this whole Project $10 bullshit.

2938
03:05:53,703 --> 03:05:54,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please do.

2939
03:05:55,003 --> 03:05:56,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we just got his 10 cents.

2940
03:05:57,944 --> 03:05:58,625
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bullshit.

2941
03:05:58,745 --> 03:05:59,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

2942
03:05:59,485 --> 03:06:06,987
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean to tell me after I spent 50 bucks on live, I gotta spend another $10 for online gaming?

2943
03:06:07,828 --> 03:06:08,568
[SPEAKER_11]: If you buy used.

2944
03:06:10,268 --> 03:06:10,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Used?

2945
03:06:10,769 --> 03:06:13,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

2946
03:06:13,429 --> 03:06:21,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And remember, GameStop now is deducting $10 from the price of their games, so in a sense, it's not really going to be any more money.

2947
03:06:22,765 --> 03:06:27,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but then the new game buyers get screwed because now their games are worth way less.

2948
03:06:27,507 --> 03:06:28,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the trade-ins will be worth less.

2949
03:06:29,728 --> 03:06:30,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't.

2950
03:06:30,268 --> 03:06:31,108
[SPEAKER_11]: They pay for it either way.

2951
03:06:32,109 --> 03:06:37,071
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're saying that this money's going to go pay for the servers and the people that admin it?

2952
03:06:37,331 --> 03:06:38,832
[SPEAKER_10]: That's bullshit.

2953
03:06:38,852 --> 03:06:45,514
[SPEAKER_10]: That money's going to upper management to fatten their pockets because I'm on that echelon of code monkeys and tech guys.

2954
03:06:46,375 --> 03:06:49,356
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the underappreciated folk in this world.

2955
03:06:50,507 --> 03:06:54,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course it was a bullshit corporate speak, but we knew that.

2956
03:06:54,890 --> 03:06:59,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what are you looking forward to at E3 next week, as I've been asking everybody tonight?

2957
03:07:00,312 --> 03:07:12,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually looking forward to hearing all of what Microsoft has to say, what Nintendo has to say, and I'm really curious about this supposed price cut to $199 by Sony.

2958
03:07:13,499 --> 03:07:17,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really curious about this, because I heard that twice, and I'm like, that's too good to be true.

2959
03:07:19,182 --> 03:07:19,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Hmm.

2960
03:07:22,313 --> 03:07:23,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else you want to say about E3?

2961
03:07:23,675 --> 03:07:26,558
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's pretty much it.

2962
03:07:26,658 --> 03:07:27,158
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

2963
03:07:27,439 --> 03:07:27,739
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2964
03:07:28,260 --> 03:07:33,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're going to let you go, buddy, so we can wrap up the show here and get out and all that fun stuff.

2965
03:07:33,605 --> 03:07:35,147
[SPEAKER_14]: But thank you so much for your call.

2966
03:07:35,187 --> 03:07:36,629
[SPEAKER_14]: And sorry I was only like half listening.

2967
03:07:36,669 --> 03:07:38,110
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes here.

2968
03:07:38,210 --> 03:07:38,571
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad.

2969
03:07:39,151 --> 03:07:39,632
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

2970
03:07:39,672 --> 03:07:40,353
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you, too.

2971
03:07:40,393 --> 03:07:41,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wait till you come out to Brooklyn.

2972
03:07:41,614 --> 03:07:42,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, goody, goody.

2973
03:07:42,355 --> 03:07:42,635
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2974
03:07:42,655 --> 03:07:43,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Mwah, mwah.

2975
03:07:44,566 --> 03:07:46,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the skyline.

2976
03:07:46,207 --> 03:07:53,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry guys, we're getting hammered tonight, but so many of you didn't get through and I'm sorry, but please feel free to send us some emails.

2977
03:07:54,333 --> 03:08:01,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to get through a little in a different way, I guess you could say.

2978
03:08:01,939 --> 03:08:07,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go ahead and go around and kind of start to wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts.

2979
03:08:07,983 --> 03:08:09,384
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be an awesome E3.

2980
03:08:09,444 --> 03:08:10,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited.

2981
03:08:10,265 --> 03:08:12,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I really hope I'm not sick or I'm going to be fucking mad.

2982
03:08:13,087 --> 03:08:18,008
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll bring you, again, special shows Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, as soon as we can get them posted.

2983
03:08:18,048 --> 03:08:20,048
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't see anything Tuesday night, don't freak out.

2984
03:08:20,569 --> 03:08:21,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Something just went wrong.

2985
03:08:21,449 --> 03:08:22,629
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to get an internet connection.

2986
03:08:23,209 --> 03:08:24,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Or we went to play DJ Max.

2987
03:08:25,010 --> 03:08:25,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps.

2988
03:08:26,310 --> 03:08:27,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So, final thoughts.

2989
03:08:27,490 --> 03:08:27,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we ready?

2990
03:08:28,070 --> 03:08:28,930
[SPEAKER_02]: My water's boiling.

2991
03:08:29,610 --> 03:08:29,831
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2992
03:08:29,851 --> 03:08:30,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, bye, Dark Sakura.

2993
03:08:30,871 --> 03:08:31,691
[SPEAKER_14]: At least it's not breaking.

2994
03:08:32,211 --> 03:08:32,491
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2995
03:08:33,951 --> 03:08:35,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

2996
03:08:36,952 --> 03:08:41,453
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is this week will be fun to watch all the different press conferences.

2997
03:08:42,355 --> 03:08:45,318
[SPEAKER_14]: My final thought is I'm excited to go home and take some NyQuil!

2998
03:08:45,418 --> 03:08:46,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

2999
03:08:46,819 --> 03:08:49,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's one last thing I wanted to think about here.

3000
03:08:49,982 --> 03:08:50,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Ponder, maybe.

3001
03:08:51,223 --> 03:08:56,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if we'll have space ponchos for our avatars on Xbox Live.

3002
03:08:57,648 --> 03:08:58,349
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be amazing.

3003
03:08:59,270 --> 03:09:00,531
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd absolutely be amazing.

3004
03:09:01,503 --> 03:09:03,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Miklatov, thank you for being here.

3005
03:09:03,064 --> 03:09:05,666
[SPEAKER_14]: You came out all the way from Kansas just to be on the show, I'm sure.

3006
03:09:05,847 --> 03:09:07,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that was exactly my reason.

3007
03:09:08,109 --> 03:09:09,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing to do with E3 or Technica.

3008
03:09:09,630 --> 03:09:11,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Mostly Technica.

3009
03:09:11,612 --> 03:09:12,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have any final thoughts?

3010
03:09:13,754 --> 03:09:25,645
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I hope that leaked floor plans for E3 are true and I get to play Pokemon Black and White and see Dragon Age 2 because those are probably the games that will be my highlights of the show.

3011
03:09:26,365 --> 03:09:26,645
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

3012
03:09:26,945 --> 03:09:27,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we'll see.

3013
03:09:27,646 --> 03:09:30,867
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just a few days away from the show floor being open.

3014
03:09:30,907 --> 03:09:31,887
[SPEAKER_14]: It's less than 48 hours.

3015
