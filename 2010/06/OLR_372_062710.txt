Orange Lounge Radio
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki
Tonight June 27th, 2010, Xbox Live might stop Final Fantasy 14 from showing up on 360
A classic PC game show is set to come back, and are people leaving their Facebook games?
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that talk show dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle
You know what, it is that show, as we say, where every gamer has a voice
And joining me over the next three hours, say hello, oh my name is Rob Roberts in case you didn't know
Joining me over the next few hours, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
Hi
How are you?
Hi
Happy birthday
Yay
Happy birthday
We're old
Yay
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki
Hi
Happy birthday
It's not my birthday
Well it's the show's birthday
Oh
Orange Lounge Radio turned eight years old this week on June 23rd, was our first show
So there you go
That's why I'm saying happy birthday to everybody
Now I did have an actual birthday yesterday, but we don't talk about that because I really am old
I'm four times the age of the show
Who's older than you in this room?
Um
Me
So shut up
Alright, anyhow, let's go ahead and introduce tonight a special guest we have here in studio
A very special, I almost said spatial guest because he takes up space, as he usually does here on this show
We always give him a hard time
He takes up less space than each of us
Actually yes, he's actually a skinny motherfucker, I hate him for it, but that's okay
Say hello, he has not been here in probably what, like four years or something?
It's been a long time
About a year
About a year, I don't know
Last time you were here we were at the other studio
By the way, say hello
No further ado, the 23rd Magus, also known as Drewnami
Do you have a new name now?
Drewnami
Drewnami still, okay
Because I know back in the day you were 23rd Magus for about the first three years of the show
Then you were Drewnami for about another, you know, I guess till now
I'm not due for another handle change anytime soon
Okay, just checking
So how are you?
Well, I heard you guys kind of missed me, so here I am
Well
And now you're in targeting range
Our aim consistently improves
Actually, it's kind of funny because you have something in common with Orange Lounge Radio, don't you?
Yes, I share a birthday with you guys
So happy birthday to you as well
And has a toilet paper joke book
Well, there's all these little in-jokes that go with Drewnami
Because you used to come to the show a lot back in the heyday
You know, we all play DDR and all those, you know, arrow stomping and arm waving
And button mashing and all those fun music games we used to play back in the day
But I gotta say, I don't know if you heard, but there's like more than 12 people listening to Orange Lounge Radio now
It's really
No!
I know, right?
Like, who would have thought, right?
So, catch up some of the people who've never heard you on this program before
What kind of games do you play?
What are you into and why are you here on this show?
Well, I'm still kind of the big Bimani buff
Although that's kind of waned a bit in the past couple of years since, you know, the genre's kind of waned
I'm the RPG, the MMO buff
If it's Square, if it's BioWare, I've probably played it
I just play a very diverse set of games
You must be looking very much forward to that new Star Wars game that's by BioWare
It's like, it's an MMO
The Old Republic?
The new one, what's the new one? Oh, I can't even remember
Star Wars The Old Republic
Is it? Okay
A lot of people say it's gonna be a WoW killer
Me, as the kind of WoW addict, I say no
Why does there have to be a WoW killer?
I mean, yes, I realize 11 million people are subscribed to WoW
But, you know, there's a lot more people on the planet, you know what I mean?
Like, I don't think WoW is gonna die by the hands of one game
It may die by the hands of itself one day?
Well, I'll get into that later because I'm really, really mad at WoW this week
Really mad
The Roman Empire was responsible for its own destruction
And who hears about EverQuest anymore?
There's gonna come a day where WoW is gonna have to go through a major overhaul
To kind of catch up, or, you know, to stay current
And, you know, sometimes these overhauls are not received very well
But I don't know, I mean, I don't want to get too far off topic
Because it's too much crystal ball and, you know
Well, a lot of people just don't juggle multiple MMOs
And I think the market's sort of reaching saturation if you ask me
Let's go to our chat room, chat.orangelaundraidio.com
And look at some comments as you folks chat live with us
Because we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio
www.allgames.com
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, he's on at about 5 Pacific
We're on at about 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern
But, you know, sometimes we run late, you know, it's just a deal
Alright, but we're here taping live, so please, if you're listening live to us on All Games
Join our chat room at chat.orangelaundraidio.com
Okay, Ziba in our chat room says
Every new MMO is said to be the WoW killer
Remember when Warhammer Online was gonna be the WoW killer?
Remember when Ion was gonna be the WoW killer?
Remember when Eve was supposed to be the WoW killer?
Well, Eve still has a pretty strong cult following
Yeah, but it's still very niche
Star Trek Online
I was gonna say, here we have Jamie and her thing is Star Trek Online
And it was Ragnarok
And I think Star Trek Online is a good example
Does it have as many people as WoW? No
But is it probably doing successful for itself? Sure
It's probably making money, you know, it's so
Probably, I doubt Star Trek Online took all these people away from WoW
I think it kind of carved itself to a new audience that maybe wasn't playing WoW before
Like Jamie, Jamie quit WoW before STO was out
Well, it just seems to me that WoW is sort of like
Remember when we discussed Guitar Hero versus say Beatmania?
How it was, it brought accessibility to the genre, brought it into the mainstream
Oh yeah
A lot of MMOs are kind of following the WoW formula, so to speak, or incorporating
And vice versa
There were so many people when Guitar Hero first came out, especially the group listening to this show
That grew up on the Bomani Games that were like
Freaking ripoff of Guitar Freaks
This is just a stupid ripoff
And Guitar Freaks is better
And the music's better
And Guitar Freaks, well, okay
And then when Beatmania US finally came out
Reviews called it a ripoff of Guitar Hero
Well that was ignorant
I mean, that was just straight up written by an intern
Ignorant intern that should never
Ignant
Ignant intern that should never
That's an insult to interns everywhere
I'm digress, sorry
Sorry Do Not Me, but you know
But I digress
The thing is that Guitar Hero, you hit the nail on the head
Succeeded where Guitar Freaks failed because
Harmonix, who was the developer at the time, took a risk
A huge risk and made it accessible
Konami, too stubborn to take risks
And I still say that's the case with them to an extent today
Too stubborn to take risks
Anyhow
Wow, fun show already
We haven't gotten into the news
Let's start off with How Was Your Gaming Week?
We always like to talk about the games we've been playing
Ladies first, Dark Soccer, How Was Your Gaming Week?
Well, it was
I don't know, it actually wasn't too bad
Because I have a DSI now
I will not say how we acquired such a thing
Huzzah!
You stole it
Killed a hobo
Killed a hobo, exactly
So, I've actually started back into The World Is Not Enough
It's a cool game
Awesome game
Oh yeah, I've heard a lot of neat things about that
I haven't spent a lot of time with that myself
Wait, The World Is Not Enough, that was a Bond movie
The World Ends With You
The World Ends With You
Because, well, I'll tell you what my brain did
Okay, here's an insight into how my brain works
I said The World Is Not Enough, then my brain went
That's not right, because that spells out twine
What game?
What?
I just think of the garbage song
That's how my mind works
I think of the song from the James Bond movie
The World Is Not Enough, T-W-I-N-E
Yeah, I get it, T-wine
So I was like, I was like twine
Like the biggest ball of twine in, no that wasn't it
That's how my brain, that's the cycle that my brain went through
T-Pain's younger sister, T-wine
And then that's when I realized I was playing Sam and Max
And that's when I realized
The World Ends With You
And that's when I realized Joshua is still an asshole
And I started actually trying to play Oh And On again
Which spells out T-weh
So, also we've been watching the Mario marathon
Because that's super awesome
And I've also been sending Dan YouTube videos of this guy
Playing a bunch of brass instruments
You know, re-recording himself
Doing like the Mario 64 theme
And playing the euphonium
Which is one of my favorite instruments
I just like to say it, euphonium
That's really about, oh yeah yeah yeah
I played some Portal
I lusted over Portal 2 some more
And um, oh yeah lots
I love your description
I lusted over Portal 2
And I played a crap
You sound like you're watching YouTube
And your tongue is on the floor
That's not what you do when you lust Rob
So pretty
Anyway, and I played a crap ton of Star Trek Online
I played enough Star Trek Online in two days
To get from Commander 2 to Commander 7
So, because you have ten ranks in each rank
So I'm three ranks away from Captain
Mini ranks
Yeah, I said you have degrees of your rank
So I am now at Commander level 7
And I will be probably Captain before my surgery
My goal is to get to Captain before I go out for surgery
Let's talk about your surgery for a minute
Because it's going to impact the show coming up
Oh shit, that's right
Well we don't have to, you know
No we can tell, it was fine
Well you're going to be having surgery, what?
On the hand again, right?
Yes, I will be a little technical here
I have trigger finger
It's also called flexor tendinitis
I have it in my middle two fingers on my right hand
And if you want to really know what the surgery goes into
Just look it up online
I'll post something in the chatroom and gross everybody out
But I was awake during my last one
And I don't really care about my new one
Because I'll be awake through that too
I'm just glad I get my benefits
No, insurance, seriously
Healthcare is the big hot issue here
And thankfully I'll be on FMLA during the layoffs at my company
So I will still have employment at my old company
And still have benefits
And then I get laid off
Work that system, work it
And then I get laid off
Aww, wah wah wah
Hire me, I'm a designer
So the whole thing about this though
Is that basically they're going to fly my hand at the palm
And cut the tendon sheaths around the middle two fingers
And then leave it open
Because what's going to happen is there's a big knot in there
And it's going to grow over the knotting
So that the swelling will go down
And as a result I won't be able to use my right hand for at least a week
And it'll be replaced by a monkey paw
No
Although actually a chimpanzee would be cool
She really will be Jamie Summers
Because they're going to give her a bionic arm
I want a bionic hand
Will you be able to go go go gadget finger?
Is his middle finger the water pistol one?
Yes
Damn it Rob, you stole my joke
But no, so I'm going to go in and have my hand flayed open
By a specialist
Ooh
And I will
They have specialists that flay hands?
Yes they do
I want to be that specialist
So I will be here for the show
I just will be very slow with
You know, probably will not be hanging out in the chat room
Or I might be in the chat room just, you know, ghosting
Slamming down random keys
And the best thing about it is Vicodin
It'll sound like a Zaku call
When he doesn't stop typing on the keyboard
Thump thump thump thump thump thump thump
No
Jamie's slamming her monkey paw down on the keyboard
She's communicating
One thump means she's angry
What I want is chimp fingers
Or like orangutan fingers, the really long ones
That I can grab things and poke holes in fruit
So
But the best part is drugs
That's always the best part of a surgery
I will be on, probably on Vicodin
They don't really care if you hurt or not
They just want you to not care that you hurt
Be sure to play tons of video games while you're on drugs
Okay get this
Last time I had my surgery, do you know what I was doing two days later?
Playing Blue Dragon
All night
Did you think the game was good?
I love Blue Dragon
It's like playing a Dreamcast game
Hey
I liked it because it was like playing a Dreamcast game
Okay
By the way, I also cleaned out a closet today
In this preparation for not being able to do any housework
And I found my Dreamcast shirt
And a crap ton of stuff that I'm sending to our buddy Rob in England
Well isn't that nice of you
Yes
Alright so no show July 4th
He sends me dirty cards every year
No show July 4th because that is the day that America celebrates fire
So we're
I mean that's a very important holiday to us
If you're having a block party for my neighborhood on the 3rd
So you totally have to come
Oh we just might actually
So we got that going on
But then come July 11th
Orange Lounge Radio will be back
You said it
And it'll be something like this when Orange Lounge Radio is back on the 11th
Orange Lounge Radio starring
Rob Roberts
And featuring
No no no no
See Rob
You have to do the right thing
You have to play the bionic level
And you know that's
Seriously what I got my name after
No I know
You know
I want to
Be all bionic and have the little
String quartet follow me around every time I run
Cause you know
They always play that string music whenever
She starts running
Cause the bionic man gets the
sound you know
I want the string quartet to follow me
Since it'll be my hand they have to play when I type
Alright
Spyro's in our chat room saying
Even though I'm British I still celebrate the 4th
Stick it to the king
No that's kind of like feeding
a cow a hamburger but okay
Alright
Double the beef why
You know that's what caused mad cow disease
I bet alright look
Occasionally on this program
We talk about video games. Loki how was your
Gaming week?
It was okay I actually played some different
Stuff this week because I am being
Forced to
Sit on a jury
Oh crap did you get picked?
I got picked
Jokes on them
Actually
Alright we're going to ask you all about
The case when it's done it's still going right?
Yeah
Okay so I know you can't talk about it cause but
Well I can't but
Actually
You want to get dismissed real quick here's your
Form
That's not dismissed that's contempt
When they're doing the interview she'll go
I support killing them
But it wouldn't be
That's okay cause Inspector Gadget can get you out of jail
It wouldn't be so bad if it was like
You know a criminal
Trial but no it's a civil
Trial you know in other words somebody
Is mad and so they're suing for
Money and that's
What's going it
I kid you not I couldn't roll
My eyes more than at this
Trial and on top of that
The prosecution lawyer is an idiot
Who talks like Andy Griffith
And it's hilarious
So is the case anything like this
When you're in the courtroom like you know
You'll just kind of be sitting there and then you know
Now the
Prosecution is going to call a witness to the stand
No it's not even that dramatic
It's like
Okay I kid you not we're not supposed to talk about
The case but we're going to talk about like this
Cause it doesn't really
No no no no listen it doesn't really talk
About the case at all they spent
An hour and a half discussing the
Difference between a phone
A speaker phone
And a loudspeaker
PA system because they were
Confused or I should say
The prosecution lawyer was
Confused and we were
Falling asleep we went
Then we finally had our afternoon break we all
Walked out into the you know
Hallway and just kind of looked at each other and
Shook our heads like this is going to last
Until November
Great you got the lawyer who watched
Too much Matlock
Oh my god the guy is like it's
Seriously Andy Griffith
He introduced
He introduced himself as
Okay I'm going to screw up people's
Names I'm going to forget things
I'm going to repeat stuff I'm going
To um get
Confused but don't hold that against
My client I'm like how much
Did you pay for this guy
Hey at least he's modest Tigerclaw wants
To know court appointed Tigerclaw in our chat
Room wants to know if the case is a little more like
Night court
I'd say it's more
Night court than law and order
Oh god look out for bull
Great
So we got inspector gadget we got
Night court I don't know I
Dread what might be coming for me but that's alright
Anyways so because I've had to
Endure um
Court
I've been playing a lot of stuff on my DS
Including peggle knights
Which is
Pretty fun and of course
Um some
Planet puzzle league
And I actually played a little bit
Of grand theft auto
Chinatown wars
But I got to say man
Chinatown wars I just don't
Dig the 2D
Well not really 2D
The top down old school grand theft auto
Stuff I mean once you've been spoiled by
Number 3 and beyond
Just why go back
I will admit I don't think I ever played more
DS than when I had um
Jury duty so I feel ya
And it's just so
Terrible cause like I have to go there
At like 7 in the morning
To get a parking spot because
Our jury is
Our jury parking lot's in downtown
Sacramento where there's
No parking because they're
Dick holes that don't you know
Provide adequate parking for the jury
So you have to get there that early in order to get
Parking and then our trial
Doesn't actually start until 9 AM
So I'm sitting there just bored
Out of my mind um
For 2 hours
They waste so much time it's just ridiculous
But um in fact
We were off Thursday
Friday and Monday of next week
Because our judge is on vacation
Thank you for taking
The case right before you go on vacation
That's awesome
Um okay but anyways
Other than that um I've been playing
More Grand Theft Auto of course um
I made
Back I guess um
The ranks that I
Lost from playing some sloppy
Games um I've been taking it
Out on my co-workers so I've been beating the
Crap out of them very
Viciously uh quadrupling
Their scores at times um
And then um
What else
Earth Defense Force 2017
Because that game is still fun uh finished
Uh the
Uh the hardest
Difficulty on that so it was fun so we're going backwards
Now playing around with the genocide gun
And then uh I actually played a little bit
Of the Crackdown 2 demo hopefully
Gonna be playing the full game
By the end of this week I just have to convince them
To give me my copy because they've been sitting
On it for 2 weeks um
But yeah it's pretty fun
And Crackdown 2 uh pretty much just like
You remember the first one it's kind of cool
If you've actually played the first game you'll recognize
A lot of the stuff in the game a lot of the
Locations are very similar if not
The same in fact I was just kind of
Walking around going wow hey I reckon
Oh my god I wonder if this is here from the first
Game oh yeah it is there it is um
So that's kind of fun and the game itself
You know pretty cool
So I can't wait to pick that up and actually play
Some maybe uh co-op online and what not
Um
But yeah that's pretty much it for right now
Uh let's see my
Gaming week then if we move on to me um
Not a whole lot of new stuff
I'm still making my way through Alan Wake
One of these days I'll beat it um
But I did spend quite a bit of time on wow this
Week you know addict uh which I'll
Come back to in a minute um I also um
Play a little bit of game room cause you know I love
Me some classic games and one of my all time
Favorite classic games came out on
Game room this week H E R
O from the Atari 2600 now
I played this a little more on the Commodore 64
With the slightly better graphics but you know it's still
The same game I remember in a nutshell
Uh the H E R O it's it's
Helicopter rescue operation basically
Um and you play this little guy
That has a helicopter on his back and it's
This cute little control mechanism and you kind of
Explore caves but in
The cave there are monsters and lava
And all these things you have to avoid and
Sometimes boats that you take actually
For 2600 game it was pretty
Darn impressive I mean they really
Packed a lot into the cartridge
Um I would kind of compare it to like
Imagine like if you could fly around in pitfall
It's kind of like that cause you know pitfall was an
Activision game too but it was one of my favorite games
Uh that came out for the 2600 but it came out right
Before the big crash so I think a lot of people
Missed this game but it's on game room now and you know
It's it's worth at least checking out the demo
And see if you like it um
I'm I tried to get a top 20 score but
I found it was it was
Very scary how much I remembered like
Go down through the left tunnel instead
Of the right tunnel or go down the third passage
Like I actually remembered how to get through a lot of levels
It kind of freaked me out so
Uh yeah there was that that was fun
Let me go back to WoW for a minute cause
Something happened on World of Warcraft
This week that kind of it actually
Really ticked me off it really ticked me off
I want to say this is what I think it is
It is it's it's um a new feature well
Here's the thing you know World of Warcraft one thing
They do very well is that they release
Content patches all the time
That add new stuff to the game
New dungeons new features you know
One of the greatest things they've added to WoW
Was just a couple patches ago the dungeon finder
Uh was an amazing addition to the game
That made leveling so different
Yeah it was a great addition
This patch
Sprays diarrhea
All over World of Warcraft
It was a terrible content patch
And I'll tell you why
For one now the game crashes
Every so often now if you have
Souped up settings on your computer
The draw distance it can't handle
Then um and uh
The Ruby sanctum I guess was released
But it's not even open yet so what else
They can't open it until they get the patch
Deployed to yeah
And then they release they release this thing
Called real ID
Real ID is what
Allows you to cross communicate
Through servers through factions
To other players that you want to
Communicate with that's what I thought it was
It's kind of their way of being
Xbox live or steam I
Guess well you know the battle nets
Kind of slowly trying to kind of poke
Poke at the steam
And the uh actually I would say it's most
You know what most reminds me of is Xfire I don't know if you remember
Xfire but the whole way
Battle nets going really reminds me of what Xfire
Kind of was or is I guess
I guess they're still going well they kind of want to integrate
The Starcraft 2 players are going to be coming up
With the wild players
But real ID here's the thing
Real ID
Allows you to communicate with players
On any server
And on any faction while you're still in wow
So that's cool
But it doesn't use handles
It doesn't use numbers
It uses your real name
To communicate with other people
It uses the name you picked
When you signed up with battle net
Which defaulted to the same name
That was on your credit card that you signed up with
To pay the game
You cannot change your name
So you must use your real name to communicate with people
And I'm okay with that
Because it is for your real life friends
You're not supposed to be giving this to people
You just randomly play wow with
That's what the normal Warcraft friends list is for
I'm okay with this
Here's what I'm not okay with
And this is where I truly feel like
Blizzard hijacked my privacy this week
Is that
They copied a feature from Xbox Live
Where you can view
Your friends list and you can go into
Any of your friends and view
Their friends list
Complete with their real name
So in other words
If I add a friend
On this battle net system
Somebody
That might be trying to
Find out my real name
Because I don't know
If it's a big secret or what have you
But I don't use my real name on this program
Neither does Jamie
Loki obviously isn't his real name either
You know we use fake names on the show
That people do out there in the world
Like you know Bono
That's not his real name
Cher is probably a shortened name
Madonna really is her name
Cher is actually Cher's name
But it's a shortened
I thought she was Esther now
Forget it
My point is there's a lot of people out there that don't use their real names
And we don't either
I actually thank Travis
Back from Understation Live for making me use a fake name
Because it's been really good
I don't like my day job
And my night job to conflict
It's nothing personal you guys
But just realize I have a day job
Where I
Privacy is a huge component of my day job
And I can't have
What I do during the day and what I do during the night
Conflict with each other
And like if that were to happen
I couldn't do this show anymore
Because I have to pay my bills
This show pays me nothing
So I realize that most people are pretty respectful of that
But here's kind of my problem with Battle.net
And I know a lot of people are like
Well if you don't like it, don't use it
No shit Sherlock
But there's a lot of social pressure
To use it
I have friends of mine asking
Why won't you add me as a friend
And I tell them
I can't have you
I can control adding you as a friend
But I can't control who you put on your friends list
Well I'm not going to put anybody on there
You don't understand
That and you might know that
But there's some really messed up people in the world
I
Many years ago
Because of this program
Had a stalker
I had a stalker because of Orange Lawns Radio
I don't like to talk about it a whole lot
Because it's one of the few cases where
I almost quit doing this show
Because it was one of those cases where
The day job and the night job were starting to come together
I was getting inappropriate phone calls
On my cellular telephone
With somebody who
I had an association with
Orange Lawns Radio
I don't often talk about it
But it happened
And it's not something I want to happen again
How do I know
Knowing that there's people like that out in the world
These people might try to use my friends
To get to me
And you might be looking at that
Going wow that sounds very tinfoil hat-ish
Or wow that sounds really kind of like
You're just like obsessing
But I'm telling you
Until it's happened to you
You don't know what lengths people will go to
I know
How do you think this person
Got my phone number
That's what I'm talking about
And so
I am totally with you guys
If you don't like it don't use it
And I don't use it
Because I don't want that to happen ever again
But the problem is
It's there and now there's these social pressures
And hearing guilds out there
Are requiring people to use it
That is so screwed up
Here's my point
Blizzard is smarter than that
They should have known this would happen
When they implemented it
I don't know what in the hell they were thinking
With this
And it's not just my problem
I mean what I talked about I believe is very serious
But let's also consider that you have kids out there
16 and 17
Whose parents are paying for their Warcraft account
Absolutely
Do you think parents know how to use it?
Think
When you were 16 or 17
Did your parents know how to totally control your gaming
Because I'll tell you mine sure didn't
And it definitely wasn't because they were bad parents
It was just because I knew computers more than they did
I was playing Nintendo with my mom
And so
If
World of Warcraft had been around when I was 16
I guarantee you I would be on battle net
With my real ID with my mom's name
And that's
This is like incredibly messed up
So basically Blizzard failed
To account for the stupidity
And maliciousness of its players
Mhmm
Sorry potential stupidity and maliciousness
Of its players
Guilds requiring that?
That is insane
Because they want to know
If you're online
It's these really stupid reasons
To use real ID
That's just like
Common sense
Or you can do what I do and don't play World of Warcraft
So
With Star Trek Online
They don't require you to have that stuff
I know I'm trying to look at some of the
Comments in our chat room
Chat.orangelaunsradio.com if you want to join in
Salacious Pop says
It only takes one person in an IRL guild
To add random pickup people to ruin it
For everybody else they know
I don't control my own list but I can't control my friends list
And that's what I really don't like about real ID
So honestly like I understand
Blizzard in a board room somewhere
Must have thought this was like
A good idea to combat I don't know
Gold sellers or something
I have, you know what? No
I can't think of why this is a good idea. I really can't
Well hopefully they'll tone that down
I realize we have people
And I'm surprised every week
At who is actually listening to Orange Lounge Radio
Cause like didn't we have a guy email or call
That was like oh yeah I worked at Infinity Ward
I was there
I was like really? I didn't know we had
People that worked there to listen to this show
If we have anyone that works at
Active Blizzard that listens to this program
Will you please
Please help us get this
Fixed because it is
Just an embarrassment to World of Warcraft
Right now. You know it
Makes about as much sense as
Locking down your Facebook privacy
Settings and I think they need to do
The same thing. I know they tried to make
Battle.net a little more social
A little more Facebook like
But they stumbled on
The same problem that Facebook had
Privacy, seeing friends of
Friends that you might not want to see
I mean I keep my Facebook
Locked down tighter than a frog's ass
For a reason
Well yeah if they want to go the Facebook route though
Facebook lets me change my name
I use my radio name on Facebook
Because I actually don't want day people to find out
It's just crazy
I don't want to say it's a dual life I live because I have one life
But I'm just very conscious about
My internet trail
And I think you have to be in this day and age
And I find the easiest way to separate your internet trail
Is to use two names. It's very easy
When you do it that way
Well you know actually I'm going to tell you this
The reason why I leave my actual name up there
Is because I'm looking to get hired
Right and I don't need that right now
I'm marketing myself
And everyone's got their own reasons for it
I think that actually it's
But you know Facebook has this thing that
In their little rules or whatever
That says if they find out that you're using a pseudonym
That they can't delete your account
So anyway
Tiger Claw Chat says
If Blizzard listens to this show they need to pay attention
Sky is their biggest customer
I appreciate the sediment
And usually I'm one of the biggest proponents of Blizzard
But people that actually get suckered into
Going to Blizzcon are much bigger
Customers than I am
Yes I think you're kind of a sucker if you go to Blizzcon
And there's people I know and love that go to Blizzcon
And it's you know
It's just my personal feeling
Well and that's the whole thing is that
It's not like Blizzard doesn't get enough money out of you
Why don't you come attend for $150
This three day commercial
No thanks I'd like to be able to afford your next expansion
Exactly
That's what Blizzcon basically
I'd rather just play your damn game
Anyhow I'm getting way off topic and there's people
That really don't want to hear this whole spiel
I'm just saying
I think this is important to talk about
For a lot of different games
Because you know Blizzard sets the standard
With a lot of things
This is one scary ass standard I don't want them setting
I don't complain about Xbox Live
Because I can change my name on Xbox Live
I don't complain about Facebook
Because I can change my name on Facebook
And I can lock it down to quote the ever eloquent
Drunami tighter than a frog's ass
I cannot change my name on Blizzard
They hijacked it from my credit card
And gave me what they would be using my name for
And that was wrong
That was wrong
Ok
Yay rant stud happy show happy birthday
Happy show
Alright Drunami what have you been playing
Oh god how was my gaming year
Well yeah in a nutshell
I've been playing a whole crap load of WoW lately
I've actually been getting into the ratings scene
Staying in the ratings scene
Right now I imagine Arthas is just
Sitting on his throne like Conan looking bored
R.P. Guild
But I've also been taking advantage
Of a lot of Steam sales
I am a consumer whore
And how
I'm buying a hell of a lot of Steam games
Playing a whole lot of Steam games
Oh have you seen the sale this week
Oh god I did take advantage of Left 4 Dead 2
Civ 4 is on sale again today
I took advantage of Left 4 Dead 2
Two days ago
Yesterday they cut the price in half
Don't you hate that
And I raged
Steam is like gambling sometimes
And then I shot zombies
Then I shot zombies
I have been really getting into
The Mass Effect series
I played through Mass Effect 2 for the past couple months
Loved the hell out of it
Waiting for the third game in the trilogy
I gotta jump in here real quick
This is a very important question in chat I want to answer
Blaze in our chat room says
Is this real ID nonsense going to be in
Starcraft 2 and or more importantly
To me at least Diablo 3
Yes
So that's why even if you don't play WoW
Blizzard has a lock on some other PC gaming
And I think it's important that
You check
Check it out because you know
That's why they rushed this patch
Because Starcraft 2 is hitting shelves what next week
July 27th
Oh I thought it was like July 7th ok but soon
So they had to implement the patch anyway sorry
I just wanted to get that out there because it's a very important question
That needed answering from our chat room
Lots of Mass Effect 2 lots of Killing Fool
A very underrated
First person shooter
It's no Left 4 Dead but it's definitely underrated
Console wise
Not a whole lot
The new Tales
The Tales Symphonia sequel was good
I've been replaying that
Finally got around to beating No More Heroes
But otherwise it's just been a whole lot of WoW
And a surprising amount of FPS
I did finally get to play WoW
Saints Row 2
Mostly because a friend of mine gifted it to me
And Loki you were into that right?
Saints Row 2?
Yeah
It had a lot of bugs for the PC port though
The PC port wasn't very good
Oh yeah it just
It was still a fun game
Just not as fun
And let's see I was playing Trine
Not Twine, Trine
Had a lot of fun
Not Twine, Trine
Had a lot of fun with that
Yeah it was a lot of fun
Isn't that a LucasArts game?
No
It was an indie game
They had it on sale a couple months back
I think they had it on sale the first day of this big segment
Oh god
Valve wants my money
They really do
Other than that, that's about it
I want your money as well
You're not getting my money
So Dan is here in studio
We can't hear him because he's not on the mic
How you doing Dan?
Greetings
Since you decided to bless our show
I don't want to talk about games
But I want a moment of your show's time
I want everyone to have a very very brief moment of silence
Can I just say it's our birthday
To mourn the passing of Game Crazy this week
As of Wednesday
All Game Crazies closed down
Wasn't Wednesday our birthday?
Leaving me super unemployed
Wednesday was our birthday
Happy Birthday!
So everybody, send me your money
I'm not worried about identity
If you want to send me some money
I'll just give you my name
It's Rob
Rob
Send your money to Rob
He'll get it to me
Yes, send Rob your money
I'll be sure Dan gets all of it
Be sure to send cash
I want his real name and address
I got it
I will hook you up
I know where he'll be every Sunday
Every Sunday
I know right where he's at
I got this
Dan, you're ignoring OLR tonight
To partake in the Mario Marathon, correct?
No, not really
If I was ignoring OLR
I would be talking to you
You were a minute ago
You were on the couch watching Mario Marathon
Those guys are not very good Mario players
But it's for a good cause
Okay, it's for a good cause
We were actually sort of talking about that we should do something like that
Except you need to play Sonic
Except for you though
Something awesome
Hey, Tigerclaw's got a great suggestion in our chatroom
Maybe Dan can be on OLR more often
Now that he's jobless
And he can tell game crazy stories
I never worked on Sunday
I just didn't want to talk to y'all
I live with him
So I'm going to be on medical leave while he's off
Oh my god, one of you two is going to kill the other
Because you're both not going to be working
Yeah, tell me about it
So anyways, if anyone knows a job
I don't care what it is
I'll shovel crap
I'll play Sega games, whatever
Just give me your money
That means you, Andrew
Next week on
Next week on Orange Lounge Radio
It's the Jamie and Dan
Household survivor
Dan?
I know where you live
Only one of them can survive
I know
A fight to the death
I know you know
We're going to do Paper Plate Battle Royale again
What are you talking about?
By the way, by the way
I just saw something that makes me incredibly excited
For my big DS9 fangirlism
Is that episode 2 for Star Trek Online
Is going to be launching on July 15th
And they're including mini games
And one of them is Dabo
Oh, Rama in chat says Dan should apply to Best Buy
Uh, no
I was waiting for a comment from the living room
Dan!
Are they hiring?
Are they hiring?
I don't think he values his soul that much
Oh, oh, oh my god
Tigerclaw, brilliant
Dan can try to sign in
To be a contestant in the latest
Season of the tester
That showed that they're casting
For season 2 of the tester
Dan should go on the tester
Oh, you know every other thing he says would be
And I play this beep game beep beep
Beep game beep
That's a brilliant idea, Dan!
What?
You need to go on reality television
I thought I was on reality television
No, we're going to put you on season 2
Of the tester
Yeah, I mean you're on reality radio now
No one listens to this show
And no one watches the tester
It'll be a perfect transition
Chirp chirp
Oh, Dan's back, hooray, my yelling worked
The tester, you know that reality show on
PlayStation Network season 2 is coming up
There's shows on PlayStation Network?
Yes, you could be
Is PlayStation Network where you go on when you're not on Xbox Live?
Yes, there's actually going to have this whole
Plus thing soon too, it's crazy
The only reason I want to go on PlayStation Network is
What is that new game that looks like Strider
That's four players
I don't know, but
You could be a Sony game tester
Sony games kind of suck
Don't screw yourself
$10,000 to the winner
Necromachina
That's not really that much money
Yeah, Necromachina, you should check that out
That game looks awesome
It's on PlayStation Network
Are you playing Mario Crossover?
Yeah, they have the new version
Are you in it now?
I set mine up to work with my gamepad
It's Rad to the Max
So I've been playing Mario Crossover this week
And I've still been playing Mario Brothers X
There's my weekend gaming
And I finished Red Dead Redemption and it was sad at the end
Really?
Jimmy wants this game too
Jimmy wants everything
I got no money
Unless you send me some, send me money so I can buy my wife games
Good luck to you in the job search
Is this done by the same guy that did Strider?
You're a hard worker
You know, we have people that listen to this show
That knew you
From your store
That was like, oh my god, Jamie's married to the guy at that store
Jamie's married to that big jerk
Who works at Funkoland
That poor woman
You guys don't know what it's like here
She's insane
Alright
Let's move on, we gotta get into gaming news
Thank you, Dan
Alright, housekeeping
And things that are coming up
No show next week
We already talked about that
Oh, I wanna mention this real quick
iOS 4 is out
Which is the iPhone thing
You know, iPad software
One of the things that's new in the iOS 4
And I'm not just talking about the iPhone 4
I mean, yes, that's out too
But we realize a lot of people listen to this show
On their iPhones, their iPods, their iTouches
There's other devices too
We are aware
One of the new things
In iOS 4 is that the show descriptions
Are actually now displayed
On the screen while you listen to the podcast
So we're gonna try in a couple weeks
Something new with the notes for the show
And we think you'll really like it
But they're gonna be kind of expanded
And time stamped
So we're gonna try something new
And we're hoping you guys will like it
But that'll be in two weeks
On the podcast, or really the next podcast
That'll hit the feed after this one
It's gonna take more work that goes into it though
So, alright
Appreciate it
Yeah, I think people will like it
It's kind of been a requested feature for a while
So we'll see what happens
Alright, anyhow, we're only 45 minutes into the show
And it barely touched gaming news
How about some video game news?
We'll start off tonight with the one and only Loki
Yes, so it's been confirmed
That the 3DS is coming out in 2011
Now, of course
Before Reggie actually
Appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show
Yes, apparently
Late Night with Jimmy Fallon is now a news
Source
It was announced that the
3DS would be out in
Fiscal 2010
I believe that's Fiscal 2010
Which would be
Between now and
March 31st, 2011
But now it's been confirmed that it's actually
Gonna launch in 2011
Do the math, it's gonna be the first 3 months
Of the year
And, uh
Yeah, that's neat I guess
Hmm
Kinda disappointing I guess if you're looking forward
To it for Christmas, but hey
There's enough crap coming out during Christmas
One less thing, I can deal
With that
I totally agree that it's very
Strange that Jimmy Fallon has now become
This kind of launching point for games, cause I guess
It was actually part of like a week of games or something
Cause I don't know if you watch
I don't know if you watch the clip
But Reggie kinda takes a jab
I believe it's Sony because he says something about
And, uh, it's not like the guys that were here last night
You don't need glasses to see this 3D
He said something like that in the clip
So it was, you know, it was just Reggie being Reggie
You know
And, um, yeah
I mean, kind of a bummer though that it's
Not coming out until 2011
But I totally wanna bet with GamerEidi
And now I'm getting a lunch spot for me
So GamerEidi, if you're listening
I like steak, just saying
I'm just kidding
Well, I'm actually not kidding, I did win a bet
But, um
Do you think it was intended
Maybe for Reggie to say this on the show
Cause this seems like an odd place
To give details about the release date
Or do you think it just kinda slipped
I don't think it slipped, I think it's just that people
When they, I mean, they announced
Fiscal 2010
And people were like, oh my god, I'm buying it in 2010
Woooo
And so, instead of just everybody being disappointed
You know, by figuring out that, hey
It's not coming out at holiday
He just went ahead and announced it
So that, you know
You don't have to assume anymore
Um
What do you think this leaves for
Cause a lot of people were speculating that 3DS
And on our nightly shows for me
3, 2, I know Shane and I were having some discussions
On this, that the
3DS really had to come out this year
Like, what else does Nintendo have for Christmas
So what do you think the holidays
What do you think the holiday season's gonna look like for Nintendo
I think it's gonna be all their games
The Kirby and the Donkey Kong
Not everything, I mean
Donkey Kong I think and Kirby are gonna be this year
I think Kirby's gonna be the one that's in November
Um, there's a lot of stuff
I think for October, there's also a lot of stuff that they
Haven't announced, or announced last year
Uh, stuff that was shown on
E3 last year is coming out
I know there's a game on
The Wii, or
I can't remember if it was the Wii or DS
It was one of the ones I saw last year though
Um, so there's still stuff
That come out
For live me, I can't remember the timeline for uh
Was it Metroid Other M?
It's August 31st
It was supposed to be out a couple days ago
Cause I remember it was my birthday weekend
Actually today, I think it was supposed to be out today
But it got pushed back
Well, that'll be a Christmas gift idea
Yes, that's right, that came out instead
Nope, I have not played it yet
Yeah, I didn't really play the first one to be honest
My Wii is still not hooked up
I will probably not be hooking it up until Metroid Other M comes out
Cause I gotta play that
I've gotta play Metroid Other M
It does look cool
Um, but yeah, I just
I haven't played
Um, the Wii console since
November, I think?
Some comments in our chat room about
Pokemon Black and White
Pokemon Black and White is asking
Is Pokemon Black and White cancelled?
Um, no
I believe they even announced a release date
October 19th in Japan
Wasn't it even sooner than that?
Like the 18th of September, I thought I read?
No, it was October
Regardless, it's fall in Japan
Yeah, fall in Japan
So it won't have 3DS support
I bet you anything it'll be out April
In the US
Because that's usually when they've been releasing
Pokemon games around the April time frame
Alright
Well, we'll see if you're right or not
I guess that's true, this last little one with the Pokewalker
Ball came out in April-ish
Uh, that's March
That's right, it was right before PAX East
But, Pokemon
HeartGold, SoulSilver, that was March
Pokemon Platinum was March
Pokemon
Explorers of the Sky
Explorers of Time, that was April
Uh
Diamond Pearl was April
So, yeah
It's usually March or April
Uh, AlphaCananagram is speculating
in our chatroom at chat.orangetonjr.com
I wouldn't doubt Pokemon Black and White
will have 3DS compatibility
Remember, Pokemon Red and Blue
had colors written in the programming for
Super Game Boy
But the 3DS cards are a little bigger
Maybe it won't matter, I don't know
Could be like the advanced dungeons in Zelda
That's what I think of
They might, I mean
I would say if anything it's gonna have
DSi support, probably not
3DS
It might have some really silly stuff, like the whole game
won't be in 3D, but maybe like the evolution scenes
or something silly, just like little one-off
things will be in 3D, little little things
We'll see
I don't think so, and the only reason why is because they're gonna be in the old carts
and it's gonna be too hard to
hold that extra data on there
But DSi support's been something that they've been doing
a lot with different games, not necessarily
You don't have to play it on the
DSi, but if you do, you can
do different things
Also some other comments in chat
Rama's a big fan of the 3DS
saying, I will get a 3DS and I will shank someone
if I have to, I think a lot of people feel that way actually
Frisbee is trying to top us all
saying, I haven't played my Wii since 2008
I'm curious though
if Frisbee's gonna break it out for anything
that Nintendo announced this year
I did play Wii Sports Golf
on
Friday because they were setting up something
for some company
that we had coming into our work
They were having a Wii Sports Golf tournament
I don't think day job stuff should count though, to be honest
Well in that case, I don't play Grand Theft Auto ever
Well
Okay, you do that on your break though, but I get what you're saying
Well technically it wasn't working
if I'm playing Wii Sports Golf
But I asked them
like, why don't you have Wii Sports
Resort Golf? That would be better
Maybe they're just not ready for that
No, they're just lame
Alright, well I believe Loki warned you about this
to go to another console real quick
I believe Loki warned you about this last week
when all the E3 news was hitting
but it does seem like it has been confirmed
In fact, a Microsoft representative this week actually spoke to the blog
Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q
I'm sure a lot of you know that blog
Microsoft representative confirmed to them that
a $199 version
of their new Xbox 360
which they're now calling the
short Xbox 360
let me put that in quotes
they're not calling it the slim now, which is good
because we talked about this last week
it is not the Xbox 360 slim
it has another name
so anyway, it is going to be coming out for $199
there is also
a new setup that's going to have the
Xbox system and Kinect together
which I think a lot of people knew
so there you go
$199 Xbox 360
system coming out soon
no date, no idea
probably what, fall-ish, I think you were predicting
Loki, before the holidays for sure
for the new system
I bet you
well the new with the
Kinect isn't coming out until when the
Kinect does, so that will be November 4th
I bet you the $199
system probably as
early as
September
just to cash in on Halo Reach
so in other words
if you were thinking about
getting an Xbox right now, wait
well wait and see
anyways because you know how they
saying that there is going to be a new $199
what if they're just dropping the price of the system
to $199
you never know
I would think though
if anything, I mean they do a lot of their
price drops and big pushes towards
the holiday and especially when they
want to capitalize on a game like Halo
Reach, just wait for
some better deals to be coming
out and besides, even if you wait longer
what they've been doing
in the past is bundling in some games
with your Xbox 360
system for free, so
if you do wait, you still might get some free stuff
AlphaKananagram in our chat room
at chat.org.com is asking, wait how much
is this bundle, did they say, I must
know for Child of Eden, everyone's speculating
what, $300? I think $300
well $299
is what the system is right now
it might be $399
hmm
I wonder if there'll be a basic version with
Kinect though, I bet there is
it's hard to say, if they're gonna
do, well
I don't know, they could do a smaller hard drive
because the hard drive is removable, it is
just like the PS3
I know, isn't that awesome?
it is awesome
alright, lowkey, how big is the hard drive
are you gonna try to put a terabyte drive in there?
I'm not getting a new system, oh yeah you don't need one
you have like five Xbox 360s
I wish I had five Xbox 360s
I don't know how many
Xbox 360s I have anymore
that's crazy, that's awesome though
alright, well speaking about the Xbox 360
it doesn't look like
they're gonna really be getting Final Fantasy 14
because
their system is so different
they were wanting to play
like a normal internet environment
and wanted to basically
for the console to mirror how it works on the PC
and Microsoft
has a closed environment
so they still can't work up an agreement
yet
seems so odd to me because
I remember being at E3
a couple years ago when the Xbox 360
was just coming out, like it was the big year
that they were gonna launch the 360 and one of the games
that they were highlighting as like
landmark on that platform was Final Fantasy 11
so it's not like
Xbox Live has never had an MMO
and ironically it was the game that came out
in the same series as this game
we're hearing about now
which looks suspiciously similar
well that's a whole other Oprah
but Final Fantasy 11
I don't think it did that well
on the 360 and I really don't have
anything to base it off of
but I'm just kind of knowing who played it
what systems they were playing on
I don't think it did well on the 360 because
most people who wanted to play it already had it
on PS2 and PC
you know what I mean? I don't know if that
set a bad precedent for MMOs in general
but if that was the case, that seems kind of crappy to me
but there's one other MMO
on Xbox 360 right now and that's Fantasy
Star Universe. Again, I don't think that
did very well either
They also were trying to get champions online
they said that the game
ran just fine, it was the business
end of getting everything in line
It seems strange to me that Microsoft
is kind of shooting themselves in the foot
with these MMOs, especially with Final Fantasy 14
and DC Universe, both slated
for the PS3 this fall
I mean, this could be where the
and what, PS3 has their own agency
we know it's coming out too? What MMOs
are on their way for 360? Are there any at this point
that we know of? No
If any, they need a recent
MMO like Final Fantasy 14
I mean, if trends
are to be believed, they got
MMOs that were sort of past their prime
It's kind of just our universe
but that didn't really take off
the way that PSO did
Or they're turning their nose up at MMOs
which, you know, they could get away with doing
possibly. MMOs have always
You know, Sony somewhat is
I don't know if they're necessarily taking a risk
but the developers are taking a risk putting the games out
on PS3, but I don't know
Like, again, I really enjoy
DC Universe on the PS3 that I
played at E3
and I could see myself paying money for that
on the PlayStation 3
If they succeed, then
they're just going to have to catch up
I don't know, it just seems very
strange to me that they would not
be trying to bend over backwards to get Final Fantasy
14 on their system, but maybe they're thinking
you know what, 11 didn't do that great
so 14's not going to either
I have no idea
I think Microsoft has their own agenda
Comment from Salacious Pop
in chat, and this is something he was telling me about
earlier today, and I want to share this with you guys too
Champions Online was developed
for a 360 release
Even playing the PC version
you can see the 360 integration
screaming at you from the UI
Champions Online was a huge flop
and it probably has to do with the fact that at least
50% of its platform audience never
actually got the game
So there you go
Champions Online
maybe was, unfortunately
did end by this whole fact that
the 360 was not going to be having its MMO
or made it too difficult
Unfortunate
Bochikawa says
PS3 is a free online service
same on PC, I think Microsoft lost
majorly because of that
Well keep in mind, I can't remember for PSU
but I know for Final Fantasy 11
it would work with a silver account
The really crazy thing about
Final Fantasy 11 I think people sometimes forget
is that it had this whole
play online front end
they're not going to have that for Final Fantasy 14
thank god
Play Online was cool for like 30 days
and then it was like, this thing is a pain in the butt
Play Online was never cool
Play Online was never cool
I thought it was cool when it first came out
but that was it. But anyhow
Play Online is on the 360 version
but here's the crazy thing about Play Online
It's a joint venture between
Square Enix and
and Sony
Play Online is a
Sony code and it was on
the 360
Final Fantasy 11
was a really not typical
game on the 360
it broke all the rules
but they were excited to have a Final Fantasy game on their
console, they let it break the rules
just like they let Castlevania
break the rules and it ended up setting a
precedent with the whole
Symphony of the Night coming out on the arcade
breaking the cap
Keep in mind, in Japan
Symphony of the Night did come out on the Saturn
What's that have to do with the 360
one though? Because
even back in the day
Sony didn't
have the whole exclusive
it was supposed to have been
exclusive and then the Saturn version came out
which apparently had all the stuff that the programmers
never got to put in. I see, I get you
so
I don't know, it would be interesting to see
what kind of comes of that
And the Saturn version was better. I think honestly
if you haven't heard of it by this point Final Fantasy 14
will not be on the 360
release date anyway. Can they add it
next year if the game becomes popular?
Maybe, but I don't know
I don't know
guys, I really don't
I'll try Final Fantasy 14 but I'm just kind of like
there's something about it
I have a really bad feeling
it's gonna flop
I don't know what it is
I think just because 11 was so received mixed
and I don't think the
PS3 is as adopted as the PS2
was and the 360
I don't know, call me crazy
What's funny is there's still a Final Fantasy
14 SKU on Xbox 360
it still exists
whether it's actually gonna come out or not
Well I think it's a place holder
You know what though, there might be a lot that
they're developing that they don't plan on releasing
I mean maybe a 360 version is further
along than any of us are giving credit for
because one other thing I don't know if we
talked about when we did the E3 report but
Final Fantasy 14 also supports 3D
right now. You can put on 3D glasses
if you have those uber monitors for your PC
you can play Final Fantasy 14 in 3D
so, but they
they took great caution to
tell us
we're messing with this right now, we don't know if it's
gonna be in the full release
this is a concept thing that you're seeing
so, who knows there
Bochikawa in our chatroom
says 14 will suck, yes, but it will still sell
we'll see, we'll see
again, I hate to base my opinion
off an early build of the game
I do believe though, I think
if 14 gets delayed to next year
it's not bad news
but that's just me
anyhow, Loki, what do you got for us?
Apparently there's a rumor coming
from Bloomberg saying
that Sony may
close a deal
securing the rights
to bring Hulu
to the PlayStation Network, it says the partnership
could be announced as soon as next
week and
that's kind of interesting since
you know, apparently there's
also a similar report saying that
it might be coming to Xbox 360
and the iPad as well
and would offer a premium Hulu
service where you could possibly pay
for maybe streaming of old
you know, archive stuff
kind of
interesting actually that
they're thinking about bringing to that platform
I don't know, I think it'll eventually
probably make its way to
each console platform
except for the Wii maybe
but why not, you can kind of
do it right now with, well you could have done it
before with the web browser, you can do it with
third party software like diversity and stuff
like that, but
I could definitely see this happening
It's interesting that Hulu keeps coming up
time and time again, like it's just like
it happened already, darn it
yeah
it's just
a matter of time
we're just waiting to see what
happens
alright, well something I really don't think
you need to wait much longer to see if it happens or not
has to do with the price of Kinect
you know what we've been saying
you know, as have most of the gaming press
that Kinect is going to cost you
$150, but Microsoft for whatever reason
just won't confirm it, like
they will not tell you the price of Kinect
but then this week, on the official
Microsoft store, that's right
online, you know, Microsoft has a store online
just like Apple does, and a lot of different companies do
they now are selling the Kinect
sensor for the Xbox 360 for
$149.99
so there you go
that's like, what a week costs
yeah, interesting, huh
I really hope this comes with
a bundle in game, cause just
$150 for the device itself
it better come with a bundle of several games
ow, I shot myself in the foot
well
the rumor is, it is
coming bundled with a game
oh really, Loki, what have you heard?
um, I heard that there's going to be a pack-in game
not sure what it is
um, I don't think it's anything that's probably been
announced yet, it's probably just tech demos
well not tech demos, but like
remember how Wii Sports was
that was all their tech demos
that'd be my guess
it could be very well
one of like, Kinect Sports or something like that, you never know
well one other quick thing on Kinect I want to get
out there is that if you were unable to go to
E3, and you happen to
live near a Microsoft store
there's not a lot of these, there's like
four, I think there's like two in Southern California
one in Arizona, I want to say
there's not a lot of these, there's like four Microsoft
stores, they're kind of like Apple
stores, but instead of Apple
it's Microsoft
you can play the Kinect in the stores
they actually have the demos right now
Kinectimals, according to the official
Twitter for the stores, which is at
the Microsoft store on Twitter
is the game that's being shown off right now
so it sounds like they were going to rotate in
different Kinect games
you know what I noticed when they have a new piece of
interface technology, remember when the DS
was just released and they just
had games
that amounted to just tech demos, I mean like
Yoshi Touch and Go
and then for the first
first part of the lifespan of the Wii
they just had games that were mostly just tech demos
I would hope since
the motion sensor technology has matured by now
that Microsoft would have
more than glorified tech demos
well the technology has matured but unfortunately
people and developers
have not matured and
I understand that developers
can do way better than what's out there
right now, but people like what's
out there right now and so that's why they're
emulating the same stuff you see on other systems
like a Wii sports type game
a Wii sports resort type game
a party game
you know that kind of stuff
since you brought up the DS launch titles though
I have to say this because this always cracks me up
you know what DS game
I don't know if it was a launch title but it came out in the first
three months, it was a launch
I owned Ping Pals
Oh it was so terrible, Ping Pals was so
I bought two copies, I was coerced into buying
two copies
it was so terrible, but here's why
it was this awesome DS game
I say awesome very sarcastically by the way
where you could chat
with other people on their
nearby DS's by like
drawing and you could do these
draw chats back and forth
and that's what Ping Pals was all about
it was PictoChat with avatars
boy Nintendo fucked them over
didn't they by putting that in their system
and it was $30 times two
it's like yeah you can pay for this
or you can play it for free now
yeah Ping Pals wasn't even online
it had these avatars
I guess there was some type of game
you may remember Rob
that when the DS came out
they didn't have online
that's right
it was like that hidden thing
Nintendo always puts that magical
thing in their new system
they'll tell you later, gotcha
it was in there the whole time
there's always something like that
seriously, with the DS it was the internet
secretly it was there the whole time
the Wii has some slumbering
stuff like that too, the channels
that they come out with
so since the buying public
is used to it, Microsoft's gonna
pick up a shovel and Sony's gonna pick up
a shovel and just start shoveling
games our way
well here's what I'm saying
I understand that
the Wii has the advantage of the price
point because it's $150
now
and they do have the
disadvantage that they're getting
you have to buy the extra sensor
if you wanna play those games
um
but I mean once again it's all about
perception because yeah, Wii costs
you know, $150 but
let's say if you're playing, you know, setting it up
for a family of four, it's gonna
cost a lot more to do that with the Wii
than it would be on the Xbox 360
I mean
even though you may, you know, it may seem
that the Wii's a better choice with all the extra
added crap to it, it's gonna
add up and
with Sony it's the same thing, you're gonna have to
buy all these different accessories, now I know you
don't have to buy all these accessories if you
wanna play by yourself, that's fine
or if you wanna play with just one other person
you know, then you can save yourself a little bit
of money but at least with the Kinect
it'll support up to as many players
as the game will support
alright, before we get to Jamie's next
story and then the release dates here, I've gotta read this
real quick because this was linked to us in chat by Robocoon
linked us to the official Ping Pals
Wikipedia article and I've gotta read this
excerpt cause it's gold, ready?
Keep in mind this is Wikipedia
Ping Pals was released on December 8th
2004, although it was marketed
as a non-violent, girl-friendly game
it was frequently criticized as not
being interactive enough to be called a game
in addition to this, the DS has a
built-in chat program called PictoChat
PictoChat includes features that
Ping Pals lacks and due to this, the game
received poor ratings, for instance
Nintendo Official Magazine gave
it 9% in its Nintendo
DS special with the opening
sentence saying, with PictoChat
coming as standard, this is
a bit like paying money to breathe air
the reviewer
gave a one-word written summary reading
pointless
uh, let's see, uh, Electronic
Gaming Monthly gave the game an average of
.5 out of 10
with the game receiving two zeroes and
one 1.5
it was really shiny, girl-friendly air
that's my favorite, girl-friendly
ha ha ha
yeah, that's why I had to buy two
copies, I love it, maybe even a brain-dead
vegetable hooked up to life support girl-friendly
the GM, GMR magazine
gave it a 0 out of 10
it's below their normal scale
nice, alright, Dar Sakura
what do you have for us, do you have a girl-friendly story for us?
I have something that makes me happy, okay
Facebook games are going poop
um, and keep
in mind the only thing that I play is Hotel City
good, I'm a fan of not playing Farmville
yeah, I hate Farmville
Farmville is like the poop
that dung beetles poop
Farmville's free on the iPhone
right now, you know
they'd have to pay me, at any rate
my friends are now playing Frontierville
Gamasutra, um
keeps up with, you know, who's
playing what on Facebook games
and, um, basically
uh, the
the big Zynga games have gone down
um, Farmville went from
66.6 million, ooh, evil
to 63.9 million
Treasure Isle dropped 2.5
million, and Cafe World lost 1.5
million, um, the only
thing there that's really keeping it
steady is, uh
well, that's attracted new players is
Texas Hold'em Poker
they got 28.6 million players
you gotta wonder how many of those are actual people
I, you know
I hate the stupid games
I think people are finally starting to go
I'm wasting my time
I could do something
have you ever heard the music in Farmville?
oh, they made new ones
what?
oh god, when I played Farmville, nevermind
when I used to play Farmville
the theme song was so horrible, it was this
one thing that would loop over and over
and over again, I guess now
I tried it once
and then I was like
ugh, why
and like, it's not even why is a question
it's why is a statement
like, if I was typing it
it would be, it would have no capitalization
and have a period at the end
it would just be why
or what
what
yeah, it would be a statement, it wouldn't even
require grammar
but see, here's the thing
I'm actually really looking forward to the Civilization
Facebook game
like, there's some really cool sounding stuff around the corner
you're a civ nerd
I really am
go by civ
like 7-Elevenville
I don't think I'll play 7-Elevenville
but no, I would go into 7-Elevenville
that's not a joke, is it?
Zanga Zanga Zanga Zanga
whatever has really taken over 7-Eleven
it's kind of disgusting
what kind of Slurpees do they have?
I didn't even look
at the Iron Man stuff
did you see what was in my kitchen?
I have a War Machine Slurpee cup
I don't even drink Slurpees
and I got a War Machine cup because I'm gonna repaint it
what's great though is some of the Farmville parodies
I gotta say, because there's one called Farmvillain
that's great
that I guess, like Robocoon is saying
you can now collect horse semen on your farm
like, there's, you know, horrible things that happen there
Rama says in our chat room
and this is why I play Pot Farm
that's gonna be a reality
in California after November
I don't know if you heard
it's qualifying for the ballot
do you want to smoke weed?
yes or no, in a nutshell
oh god, what is my anti-nausea medication
it'll pass
well, not even a question
it's gonna pass
I'm glad you asked, because it's coming in November
no, no, no, no
the anti-nausea medication FROM
all that
yeah, but that actually is good for anti-nausea
they're actually allergic to it, but then again some people also allergic to cigarette smoke
dude, California's gonna be the only place
where you can go to Taco Bell
and get a number one that comes with a quesadilla
two crispy tacos
a gordita
and BUD
and a joint
we're gonna be
Amsterdam the sequel
oh my god, it's a good time to stay indoors
just need the hookers now
here's the thing
for like 60 days
ahh, it's too far away
for 60 days, it's gonna be the most
lolsy thing you could ever imagine
everybody will be
eye for like 60 days
not everybody, I don't smoke pot
California stood still
there's gonna be so many people
just like, it's 4.20 every day
and then, you know what
it's gonna, ok, alright
it's like when prohibition was eliminated
drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, pass out, wake up
ok, we're over
I'm gonna get political for a second, Rob, may I?
oh hell why not
disclaimer, ok, let's go ahead
and look back at history, and this is why
this whole stupid war on drugs thing is
pretty much bullshit
when they made booze
illegal, what happened?
an increase in crime
we had the heyday of the
old school gangster
you know, but Dick Tracy was here
to make it all better
but my point is
that when you made booze illegal
crime went up
now, and this is actually
the best way I can paraphrase it
ok, there was a Bloom County strip
a while back, you know where Opus the Penguin came from
and
he and Oliver Wendell
Jones
were selling
hair growing tonic made from cat sweat
and
the moment it became illegal, their prices
shot up, so they could charge more
for it, and then they were having people
you know, run guns and everything
and another one actually in the same comic
is when
Opus and Bill were running for president
and the drug traffickers came up and said
we hope you'll have tough gun laws, that makes
more profit for us
I mean, I know that that's
you know
a parody, you know, just a little political
commentary on it, but
the numbers are there
you know, gun free zones
have a higher
rate of gun related deaths
than
you know, places where it's legal to
carry a firearm
criminals don't really care if it's legal or not
no, but they're less likely
to use it when the other person might be armed too
I feel like Jamie should have a theme song when she's giving
history lessons here on the show
so do you want to continue with your history lesson
yes I do
I'll play a little bit of
God Save the Queen here
anyway
but I'm saying
I'm going to completely second what you said
Rob, the moment that the
pot loss pass
you're going to have a month where people are going to go
ahhhhh
and all of the right wing nut jobs
are going to go, ah see we told you
and then
a month later, two months later
it'll be nothing, no one will care
you mean I can go outside?
yes, it's safe
you mean I actually do go outside?
um, it's safe
but you know what this means
there will come a day
the Orange Lounge radio episode where we're all
high as fuck
and that will be just another episode
where I'm in the chat room
yeah, me too, it'll sound like every other episode
yeah, I'm allergic to pot too
but my whole point
my whole point, and this is the
biggest thing with, in fact
I've been listening to a lot of
history podcasts and maybe I'll plug
them later, but
the biggest thing for anyone
if you want to look at what's going on in business
right now, if you want to look at what's going on
in politics right now
if you want to see, is A or
B going to work, look
to about a hundred
to eighty years ago
and
you know, then tell me, will it work?
well I think
oh, it's the same idea, it's the same idea
I think in this year, 2010
the question is not, will it work
but will it blend
alright
but, okay, thank you for letting me rant
you're welcome
just the biggest thing is that
if you want to see if something's going to work now
look to the past
Frisbee in our chat room says, OLR with weed
is Orange Lounge foodie-o, like I said
just like every other week
have you ever done OLR
on weed?
you boys like Mexico?
and by the way
one last little political
snipe, if you
want to see what
for all the advocates that were
voting for unregulated business
look back to
Carnegie and to
Rockefeller and see how well
people fared when they were in control
of unregulated business
including moderation
alright, yes, moderate moderation
alright, that's redundant
alright, let's
thank you for calling the department
your redundancy is repetitive
alright, let's move on
release dates
weed is coming out November 4th
just kidding
alright, what's coming out in the US
you know that's kind of odd
it's timed right with the connect
connect
works off weed
anyways, there's
lots of stuff actually coming out this week
pretty decent release week which is good because
next week there's not a whole lot
so this week we've got
Sin and Punishment start successor
actually it's not this week, that's today
so you've missed out on it already
possibly
and you wasted your whole day watching the Mario
marathon and you could have been playing Sin and Punishment
Sin and Punishment, at least it's a good cause
Death Smiles
limited edition, making its way out to the
Xbox 360 this week
a pretty awesome shmup game, definitely worth
picking up, and plus you get a nice little
face plate for your Xbox 360
and the soundtrack, so
sounds like a good deal
Think Smart on Nintendo DS, yet another brain
training game
Lego Harry Potter on the
Playstation 3, Xbox 360
Wii, DS, and PSP
and probably the PC as well
A 10 Minute Solutions from
Activision, it's a fitness game
based off, I guess, a DVD series
99 Nights 2
now with more nights
Coming to Xbox 360
99 Nights 2, night harder
99 Nights 2, Electric Boogaloo
Singularity
on Playstation 3, Xbox 360
and PC
might call that Time Shift 2
The
Last Airbender, the game
based off the movie, based off the
anime, based off
another game, no
that's on DS and Wii
I'm sure it's going to be so much better than the
you know, the ones based
off the animated series
the twist is not
Sniper Ghost Warrior
on PC and Xbox 360
Sniper Ghost Warrior?
Yes
Sniper Ghost Warrior
It's not like a sci-fi movie
starring, you know, Debbie Gibson
I'm sorry, Deborah Gibson and Tiffany
They're like ghosts because they hide
in the shadows and snipe you in the head
I gotta start that tangent again
about why they need to make games out of sci-fi movies
because did you hear the one this week about
Debbie Gibson and Tiffany being in a movie?
Together?
I saw that article and I was just like
I don't care
You know what though? I do agree
with you because cheesy games do
end up being
pretty cool, which is why
once again I must
urge you D3
publishing, bring over the
simple series. Come on
you know you wanna
and I know Oni Chumbara didn't really do that well
over here, but Earth Defense Force 2017
is so awesome! All you need to do
is remake the second game. I know the
second game was almost the first game
all over again and the third game was basically the
first game all over again, but
it's, you don't really need to do anything
all you need to do is put more levels
and they only have to be that different
just more levels, completely forget
the last games existed, add a few different
enemy types, I think you should make a
level editor in there, and four player co-op
and four player system link
or four player over live
Speaking of gold
speaking of Ludacris, you might like this Logie
I was listening to Bobby's show on the way over here
in the car, on the handy dandy all games
iPhone app, and he was
talking about risk factions, and I'm kind of
paraphrasing here because I haven't played the game myself
but he did, but he was talking about
how, you know, there's classic risk in there
where you can play as all the different countries and dah dah dah dah
but in one of the new modes, like a story mode
or whatever, like the different factions are like
humans, zombies
and cats
and robots
I'm like, this sounds awesome!
So, you can
lead an army of cats against an army
of zombies. Amazing!
So we need more cheesy games
like, uh, Tachyon
starring Bruce Campbell. President cat, hello
whatever happened with that, don't think I even forgot
I mean, look at the symbol series over in Japan
on the Playstation 2, they've released
like a good 50 games
at least, in that series
you know, for like 20 bucks
they just take these really weird, independent
games, I guess, and then throw them out there
I mean, they have one with
versus with, you know, miniguns
you know, mowing down zombies
they have zombies versus ambulance
you drive an ambulance and you run over
zombies, it's awesome
and then, you know, there's actually a lot of games
with zombies now that I think of it
for the simple series, because there's only
Chambara, which is basically you fighting zombies
with a samurai sword and a chick wearing a bikini and a cowboy hat
but Earth Defense Force
is so awesome though
it's an incredible game
and I really want to go back and play the Playstation 2
version of Earth Defense Force 2
because they have like a chick with a jet pack
you can fly around as
they have these different
different looking characters
I mean, they're the same
they have the robot types and the UFOs and stuff like that
but the one robot type in there
kind of looks like a tripod from War of the Worlds
and that's really cool!
and it's just, the whole point is cheesy stuff
even like, you know
Zombies Ate My Neighbors
a perfect example of how you can make a game that's cheesy
that parodies a bunch of like, you know
old sci-fi horror movies
I think it's a great idea
but anyways, we're getting on a tangent here
so
O.S. we do!
More stuff coming up this week
Fallen Earth Blood Sports on PC
Kind of wonder, what sports
are they playing in Fallen Earth?
I don't know
It doesn't say
I think it's an expansion
Uninterested
Missed on DS
I'm guessing that must be re-released
because I could have sworn that's been released before
or maybe it's a different publisher now
but if you haven't picked that up
you can pick it up now
play a game that's really, really old
Let's see
What other fun stuff do we have here?
Oh yeah, Just Sing
with microphone for the DS
so you can sing karaoke
on your DS
Not quite
Different company
I wonder if you can sing
Brew
Naughty Bear
on Playstation 3
There's a lot of those in San Francisco
Did you see the trailer for that?
That looks like fun!
No, I haven't seen it
I'll YouTube it right now
It's like Hitman with teddy bears
You're trying to get revenge on all the other teddy bears
in the village
and the whole point is to be as evil as possible
you have an evil meter
or a naughty meter
and you can kill them but you get more points
for torturing them and being witnessed
torturing them
So it's Overlord with teddy bears
It's beautiful
It's horrible and beautiful at the same time
I love it
Oh wait, this is an ad
fucking YouTube, hold on
Crackdown 2
is an excellent game that will be coming out next week
on the 6th
I want Naughty Bear
But it's way better than Naughty Bear, sadly
Naughty Bear though, you can set traps for them
Do you know how much fucking traffic
those naughty bears caused in San Francisco today?
I had to go around
Oh, here we go
360
Shut up
This is quality radio ladies and gentlemen
I know, this is great radio
