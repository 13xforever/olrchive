14299	19086	Tonight, June 6, 2010, a lawsuit is filed against Final Fantasy XIII.
19446	25255	Rumors say a new dance game is coming to Project Atal, and could you soon pay a new tax on your consumer electronics?
31704	35766	Hello my friends and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35826	39268	We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
39728	44170	It is episode number 369 for this June the 6th of 2010.
46931	44170	69.
47672	48572	My name is Rob Roberts.
48592	51113	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
51173	54575	First off, the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54795	55095	Hi.
55355	55796	How are you?
55816	56476	Hi.
58837	61159	I see, needing a good oiling, apparently.
61439	69303	This is the first day I've actually felt somewhat decent, so I've been sick, but I am mostly over it, a little leftover.
69923	71444	My voice may go out during the show.
71604	72325	You know what you need?
73245	73946	A lozenge.
74226	76067	You need, well that, and you need salad.
77385	82829	I went to Fresh Choice, just like Jamie.
82909	84791	I saw your picture.
84831	85692	I sent you a tweet.
86432	88394	But I have been eating salad all weekend.
88474	90035	I had an epic salad yesterday, Rob.
90055	90375	Get this.
92777	114650	and so there's different levels of salad there's like you know there's there's level one salads you're like basic house salad then there's epic salad of awesomeness my salad had used red vein chard which hard is delicious and raw squash and Roma tomatoes and dehydrated apples and
115130	119272	and Chives and what else did I put in that thing?
119812	120872	Oh, Pea Sprouts.
121873	122213	Pea Shoots.
122353	122933	Sorry, Pea Shoots.
122953	123633	And broccoli.
123653	126094	And occasionally we do talk about video games here at Orange Lounge Radio.
126114	127555	With a raspberry vinaigrette.
128155	130296	But don't put your video games in raspberry vinaigrette.
130316	130836	It won't work anymore.
130856	131556	Is that not epic?
131576	132237	It sounds pretty epic.
132337	132977	It was really good.
133177	133397	All right.
133677	134698	I'm going to have gelato today.
135299	135799	Also here.
135819	138161	I've got to introduce the one and the only tech master, Loki.
138641	138941	Hello.
139181	139882	How are you doing, Loki?
140402	141263	I'm full.
141603	142063	You're full?
142123	142724	What have you been eating?
142764	143364	Not a salad.
143685	144265	I can see that.
144325	144925	Breadsticks.
145006	145646	Breadsticks.
146467	146647	Yeah.
146847	148408	This should be like a food MMO.
148628	149028	I don't know.
149108	150670	Let's go to Sizzler, the MMO.
150710	150750	No.
154741	155522	Don't need that.
155862	156202	All right.
157163	161585	Anyhow, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio.
161826	167609	www.allgames.com 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
167669	170771	So do pull up a chair and join us in our chat room if you are listening live.
171092	176755	chat.orangeloungeradio.com We're going to be talking video games over the next few hours tonight.
176835	179057	Lots of E3 rumors and kind of things...
179697	183280	We're in that period where E3 is right around the corner.
183320	185762	Obviously, we're, what, eight days away from the first?
185902	199992	No, actually, we're one week away from the first press conference, if you count the Cirque du Soleil Project Natal thing, where they're going to announce the real name of it, which I heard a little rumor, take it with a grain of salt, Xbox Wave.
200713	201053	Don't know.
201593	202754	How would you feel about that as the name?
202774	204135	You think that's a good name for a peripheral?
204515	205016	Xbox Wave?
205036	205276	Yeah.
206698	207539	It's interesting.
207559	209240	I can see them doing little title waves.
209460	210581	Jamie's waving her hand.
211301	212802	At least it's not the Xbox flail.
213203	214624	That's, I guess, a little better.
215744	217626	That would be if they put Parapara on it.
218246	218586	We'll see.
218627	220468	Take that with a gigantic grain of salt.
222329	225712	I just had a thought about the Natal thing and Parapara.
226272	226592	What's that?
226792	227613	Could you imagine that?
228376	228956	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
252851	256653	But otherwise, the show was just kind of like a lot of it was behind closed doors.
256993	267481	A lot of it was more conceptual because you had Natal and Move being announced, and I guess the vitality sensor to some extent, but nothing really being shown.
267521	274365	So I think this year, we're really going to see what is going to be out on the shelves this Christmas, and there's going to be a lot fighting for your attention this year.
274385	275346	It's going to be very interesting.
275834	276134	DarkSakura
291597	295681	Well, as I was playing just a moment ago, I was playing some Portal.
296501	300245	But I really have to owe it to a lot of Star Trek Online.
300725	306570	Because I realized that I had three more ranks to go before I hit Commander.
307191	308932	And damn it, I'm almost there.
309573	311214	Because I want that extra pip.
312615	322057	Um, other than that, I also, uh, canned two of my crewmen and now have this weird purple dude, or purple chick, who just is bizarre looking, but she's got good stats, so whatever.
322817	327718	Um, and, um, I have to say, the crystalline entity is a bitch.
328779	329259	What is that?
329519	332419	What is, what is the crystal, I don't, I'm not a big enough nerd.
332519	333920	It was a next generation foe.
334620	334860	Okay.
335743	340386	and it's this big crystal thing, spiky crystal thing floating in space.
341367	343509	And in the show, they used a high-pitched noise thing.
343529	345030	Did they eject the warp core to fix it?
345310	345350	No.
345370	346831	Because that's always how you fix the problem.
346851	347872	They pretty much screamed at it.
347892	348452	You eject the warp core.
348532	348772	Oh, okay.
349413	350233	Pretty much screamed at it.
350253	353115	They used a high-pitched harmonic or something.
353315	355277	So you're saying that the purple chick is a butterface?
356317	356678	What?
358219	359860	She looks strange, but she has good stats.
361201	365004	Okay She has a nice body but her face, is that what it is?
365505	372571	Yes Okay Whatever Anyway Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait Do you want me to find a picture of her?
372591	378476	Wait, no I want to ask you something Star Trek related Have you heard the commercials on the radio?
378536	384561	There is the Star Trek tour Is apparently like right around the corner from my house McClellan
384801	388382	Yeah, not giving away where I live on the show, but that's right around the corner of my house.
388683	390063	Yeah, it's like one exit up the freeway.
390163	390703	Oh, I didn't know.
390783	391004	Yes.
391864	392364	Oh, I know.
392704	393044	Sorry.
393204	393845	Well, now you know.
393885	395725	Now the entire internet knows where I live.
395806	397986	I thought you lived in the butt end, the other way.
398607	398787	No.
399707	401428	Dan's in the other room singing Knowing is Half the Battle.
401448	402968	We need to get Dan a mic in the living room.
403008	409851	We need to get like a really long cord just so Dan can give his MST3K commentary during the show from the living room.
410191	410411	Anyway.
411092	411172	Um.
412873	413193	and BurgerTime.
413293	415234	And then we'll have some fava beans and a nice canteen.
439972	449638	Anyway, this is an open letter of annoyance to people who play Star Trek online.
451039	454060	First of all, the crystalline entity thing is an open instance.
454100	455521	That means anyone can join it.
456062	460884	Even the most retarded of the retarded, the butt-tarded, can join this instance.
461665	463186	Do not use mine!
464448	465229	Do not use mines.
465309	468431	The way that you beat the stupid thing is you eject the warp core breach.
468552	469632	That's how you kill it.
469673	469933	No.
471134	476118	The way that you kill the thing is that when you get it down to 30%, it's going to shoot out these large crystals.
476198	477699	Don't shoot the fragments.
477719	482524	Shoot the big crystals because the big crystals go back and regenerate the damn thing and then it shoots out everything and kills you.
482664	484085	We can't do it, Captain.
484265	485626	We don't have the power.
487628	490310	Just people think strategy, please.
490450	492212	Does anybody ever yell that in Star Trek Online?
492711	493933	We don't have the power!
494314	494594	No.
496517	498360	I'm sure somewhere somebody has.
498560	499602	They keep mentioning Worf.
500644	501785	Right.
502266	505872	I actually enjoy all the instances that involve the Klingons because they're so much fun.
507837	509378	I'm really enjoying the game, okay?
509459	511160	And Rob, you were supposed to play with me.
512521	513602	I will use the pass.
513822	514222	I will.
514382	517084	It's just, you know, World of Warcraft, Addict, etc.
517145	517485	Okay, look.
517725	518486	I'm looking in our chatroom.
518506	525311	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And SSJ100Matt is saying that Tigerclaw has already found my house, apparently.
525451	525631	Oh, no.
525651	526232	Loki's house.
526792	527312	Or was it my house?
527333	527733	I don't know.
527753	530535	Well, because Tigerclaw is the expert in our chatroom.
530555	533257	Like, if we mention something, he'll have a link in five seconds.
533317	534118	He's amazing.
534398	536560	His Google Foo is unmatched.
537401	545776	Let's see, SSJ100Matt also commenting on the date between DarkSakura and myself Rob better put out Yeah Rob
547216	549917	Yeah, put out the credit card to pay the bill.
549977	550858	That's what I'll be putting out.
551038	551478	That's right.
551558	552439	All right, let's see.
553339	555000	And then, where was there?
555020	556000	There was another one I wanted to say.
556160	556400	Oh, yes.
556701	561743	Bobby Blackwolf, our old pal, buddy, friend who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, he is hatin' on split second.
562003	565105	Like, if you listen to his show tonight, it's just an hour of split second bashing.
565165	566866	Not really, but it might as well have been.
567466	571488	He says in his gaming week, he ejected the warp core breach that is split second.
572028	574370	because he is not a fan, apparently, of Split Second.
574410	583418	I have not played Split Second outside the demo, but maybe next week I'll have more of an opinion and I'll either eject Bobby's opinion from the Warp Core or whatever.
583538	583879	I don't know.
584319	584639	We'll see.
585040	590365	Well, I also have to say the thing that Dan's been playing because I have totally just gotten a kick out of watching him play it.
590665	594248	We don't have the other controller hooked up where I'd play it because you can play simultaneous on it.
594909	595890	Is Super Mario Bros.
595930	595950	X...
598098	602679	Speaking of pals from All Games Radio, I noticed Derek H. from Dead Pixel Live is in our chat room.
602759	604940	And if you don't listen to Dead Pixel Live, you're an idiot!
605420	608121	It's on, what, Monday through Thursday at All Games Radio.
608141	609541	So they do lots of shows.
609781	611882	And he's asking a good question I want to pose to Jamie.
612162	614843	Is Star Trek Online anything like you're in the show?
615243	621744	I did tell him that it's pretty episode-like and that I love it, but I will give a little bit more of an apt description.
622425	622665	Okay.
623225	627586	You have... You basically talk to your commanders.
627606	630426	You can talk to them via subspace, and you get your missions.
630946	632927	So you go to whatever system.
632967	634207	Sometimes it's just a patrol.
635047	642029	Sometimes you think you're going to some abandoned place to look on some research that you don't know why it killed everybody.
642389	643649	And, oh, the Romulans are there.
644741	645682	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
668915	673620	and, you know, they do new episodes with new missions and everything and I think that that's pretty sweet.
674220	678244	But really, it's like you're playing through seasons of the show.
678545	679245	For me, that is.
679806	686973	I mean, and the other times where I'll scream at the stupid, you know, the Romulan medics are the worst because, like,
687333	688153	Shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate!
688193	688914	Shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate!
688934	689594	Shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate!
689614	695976	Anyway, but they really do, you know, pay a lot of attention to canon in this, too.
696616	699017	Like, now, I've been reading the books.
699457	701457	Keep in mind, this is a different universe than the books.
702058	706799	The books were written before the new movie came out, and this is incorporating the new movie into the storyline.
706839	708700	So, basically, Romulus, go boom.
709980	711241	Warf gets pissed off at everybody.
712002	712602	Pissed off.
716004	721128	It really is a good continuation, but it says something like 20 years later.
721508	724670	You actually run into people who were children in the series.
724831	728113	You run into Meral Paris, and you run into Kiriyoshi O'Brien, and
729268	729949	It's really neat.
730729	732950	It really is like being in that universe.
733070	735271	Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.
735791	736312	No, it's cool.
736632	736952	It's cool.
737873	739033	I do want to play a little more.
739053	742535	I only played during the beta and I wasn't totally absorbed with it.
743635	745356	It was the space combat turned me off.
745476	748998	I liked the away team mode, but I didn't like the space combat at all.
749078	753180	Actually, Rob, they've really, really addressed a lot of the problems with space combat.
753300	753740	Okay, cool.
753801	754921	It's a lot smoother now.
755541	758483	The other thing, too, is that once you get a little bit more used to the controls...
759424	760847	It actually is really fluid.
760887	763792	Now, you and I may have had the same problem.
764213	766357	My graphics card was crap.
766538	767519	I fixed that, though.
767720	771427	And now I can run WoW at highest settings and it's purdy.
772205	773485	Well, then you should have no problem.
773505	778487	When I upgraded my graphics card, a lot of my problems with control stopped because I wasn't lagging.
778647	779067	Okay, cool.
779247	791351	Because it would literally, now the difference between graphics card lag is that it would be stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter, and internet lag is that you'll go forward, you'll row back a few steps and you'll go forward again.
792412	794712	But that's very few and far between.
795593	799974	It's just a little lag and it looks like you've gone back like a millimeter on the screen.
800154	803956	Wow lag can suck when it's like seconds and seconds of lag.
804116	809319	Yeah, just everything kind of freezes in place and then everything happens in like half a second.
809519	809979	I hate it.
810199	810979	Oh, it was bad.
811460	815862	I mean, usually the game doesn't get too laggy, but when you get those lag spikes, oh man, world of hurt.
816102	817222	No, I hated it.
817282	823245	I mean, that was one of the reasons that was, I like the lag in Star Trek Online a lot better than the lag in World of Warcraft.
823566	825807	In fact, I actually don't like World of Warcraft, so that helps.
826993	827434	I tried.
827674	829575	I got a character to 20, Rob.
829915	830155	I know.
830276	830696	I got one to 20.
830736	830976	I know.
831717	839502	So yeah, if anyone wants to play with me, just saying, my whole account name is DarkSakura.
839722	840963	Duh.
841083	845786	My character's name is Idarin, E-D-A-R-Y-N.
847007	848088	Yeah, I'm playing a Trill, whatever.
849209	850189	Because Trills are cool.
851070	852971	And so, yeah, we need a fleet.
852991	854012	We need the O'Larmy fleet.
854332	854893	DarkSakura.com
879893	881535	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
899472	910056	But it's basically this guy's made different, you know, Mario, Super Mario games that'll have elements from Super Mario World, Super Mario 3, even the flurries from Super Mario 2 are in the level.
911041	912582	I thought it was a very good looking game.
912602	915905	I mean, it just looked like Super Mario World, at least the little bit I saw.
915966	919789	I didn't, you know, Dan tried to show it to me in about 10 seconds, like, you gotta check this out.
920630	923613	He was playing levels last night that are really reminiscent of Super Mario 3.
923693	929738	Well, the part that made me go, oh, neat, is that it was two players simultaneous, kind of like the new Wii game is all simultaneous.
930018	933441	Well, we and I haven't played it together yet, but I have to say that it's...
934623	936364	Dude who made that game, well done.
936765	937886	Very much well done.
938346	941209	Enjoy it while it lasts before Nintendo sues the pants off those people.
941590	945834	Although there is a big splash screen that's basically the equivalent of, please don't sue me.
946174	947716	I love Nintendo.
948176	948496	Has it?
948597	950639	Yeah, it's been around for a while.
950699	955283	One of the games he has on there is the first one he ever did, which is really annoying because all you ever get is mushrooms in it.
957031	959852	But it's really, he did a great job.
959872	968134	There's this one level that Dan was going through where you get the buzzy beetle shells and you have to break purple blocks with them.
968154	970315	So you have to get to the purple blocks and everything to unlock a door.
972015	974836	It's got some definitely creative elements in it.
975497	976277	I think it's pretty cool.
976937	980418	When I have some time that I'm not feeling like crap, I'll play it.
981471	981771	All right.
982652	984454	Well, let's move on with our gaming weeks.
984595	985436	We're almost 20 minutes.
985556	986797	DarkSakura, you played a lot tonight.
986897	988319	Actually, most of that was Star Trek babble.
988339	988679	That's okay.
988739	989740	I also still had to do a plug.
990481	990822	Oh, yes.
991002	994285	Well, let's do it during housekeeping because I do want to give that plug as well.
994906	997369	Loki, what did you... Oh, you're chowing down over there.
997389	998530	Are you ready to talk about your gaming week?
998550	999411	I'm almost done eating.
999491	999772	All right.
999852	1000232	Sorry.
1000993	1001393	Bad time.
1001413	1002635	You want me to go my gaming week then?
1003191	1003511	No, I'm ready.
1003611	1004051	Okay, go.
1004091	1007933	Okay, so this week I played really only three things.
1009274	1022881	Red Dead Redemption, played a lot more System Link co-op, and the game, surprisingly, I don't know how to really put it, the System Link games, we have trouble staying in the same game.
1023101	1023842	Like, it will...
1024762	1026503	have trouble joining a System Link game.
1026643	1029725	I have never seen a game that has trouble joining a System Link game.
1029825	1032526	And a System Link game means your Xbox are connected.
1032566	1033707	You're not even on the internet.
1033747	1035888	You are literally connected cable to cable.
1036508	1038729	And it's just like... And you can't find the other Xbox.
1038849	1040110	It's like, oh, you're in your own game.
1040310	1041290	And I have to find a new game.
1041490	1042511	Oh, you're in your own game again.
1042751	1043351	Find a new game.
1043571	1044272	Oh, there he is.
1045052	1050015	And we're like, we finished the mission or whatever, co-op mission, and it split us off into two different games again.
1050095	1052036	I'm like, what the hell is wrong with this thing?
1052876	1054317	But yeah, it's very buggy.
1055818	1063383	We had issues with where we were playing and we got dynamite and the Molotovs and stuff like that.
1063743	1071048	And it stopped showing us the explosions and the blood splurts and also the fire.
1072229	1077212	And then my friend had trouble going through a gate because on our screen, the gate was open.
1077392	1079334	On his screen, the gate was shut and locked.
1079954	1082196	So it was interesting.
1083476	1085597	But yeah, it's still really fun.
1085617	1097439	I haven't gotten to play a lot of online, because trying to join games online, at least at our work where our connection's not so great, it's near impossible to do it.
1097819	1108701	So we just basically stick to System Link games, because at least that way, if live drops, which it does all the time on our connection there at work, it doesn't matter.
1109121	1110081	So that's kind of fun.
1111341	1122504	And then also this week I went and played some Grand Theft Auto, Battle of the Gay Tony, more of the Episodes of Liberty City stuff.
1123184	1124284	I'm still playing through that.
1124304	1128405	I'm actually still moving up the ranks because I haven't lost a game in a few weeks.
1129706	1132246	I'm 63 now, which is pretty cool.
1133167	1138728	And really frustrating the hell out of my coworkers because they're getting pissed off now that I don't lose any games.
1140646	1155570	They're saying... Because there was a guy that used to play with us named Chris Marsh and they're saying he... What I'm doing is very Marshian because he would, you know, pull off these just crazy ass kills and stuff.
1155610	1160472	Like, for example, in the old PSP game, Liberty City Stories...
1161332	1162333	It was very glitched out.
1162373	1165254	I mean, we had problems with teleporting grenades and whatever.
1166174	1168515	But he actually got one kill one time.
1168595	1171037	He actually got two kills out of one death.
1171617	1178900	It was just ridiculous because he killed somebody and somehow they had just driven over health or something and then they got a second death.
1179300	1182482	So he got two points for where he should have only gotten one.
1182962	1196055	I've actually gotten assists off of my own death, so I actually got points for me dying, which makes zero sense whatsoever, because you're not supposed to be able to do that.
1196455	1201420	And it's not my fault, it's just the game is really glitchy, and that's just the way things are.
1202521	1208466	Speaking of glitchy games, I've gone back to Earth Defense Force 2017 and I am going to beat it this time.
1208747	1217835	We actually were playing some more and just going through the game and almost finished the game now.
1218095	1220257	So I will be finishing that game hopefully soon.
1221218	1223540	Kind of had to dust it off again.
1224060	1229527	Actually cracked my copy, but thankfully a while back, I bought the last three copies we had for $5 each.
1229887	1230168	Nice.
1230548	1231710	So I have spares.
1232230	1232631	Wow.
1233231	1235554	You should, I don't know, give one of those away as a prize.
1235574	1237897	I was planning on it someday, but I cracked the copy.
1237937	1239279	Endorsed by Loki Edition.
1239299	1239860	It's awesome.
1239880	1240781	I bet the developers would love that.
1241181	1241441	All right.
1241982	1243164	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1245973	1247914	That's pretty much it as far as stuff I've played.
1248314	1250035	I'm kind of working on something right now.
1250135	1254157	Well, I'm working on a lot of things because that's just the way things work.
1254477	1261561	I'm working on painting the baby's room, which is game-related because it's New Super Mario Bros.
1261621	1261961	themed.
1262321	1263041	That's going to be cute.
1263081	1264922	You should put pictures on the LR feed.
1264942	1266083	Oh, yeah, there will be tons of pictures.
1266543	1267564	It's going to be pimped out.
1267984	1273907	We got some of the wall decals, but we're going to paint a lot of it, but we want the wall decals for the characters and some of the other stuff.
1274187	1275208	You're doing Mario, you said?
1275408	1276408	Yeah, new Super Mario Bros.
1276448	1276669	theme.
1277589	1282652	I have a plan I can give you to make hampers look like the pipes.
1283873	1284073	Huh.
1284633	1285574	I'll have to look at that.
1285734	1288736	Because I was just going to get giant PVC and make it into a pipe, but...
1289096	1292658	That was, well, it's something that I had planned because that's what Dan and I were going to do.
1292818	1294059	Cool.
1294219	1296540	And then I got some other stuff from ThinkGeek.
1297161	1301803	Like I got a, it was an open source music box.
1302443	1304905	So we have it so that you can make the Super Mario Bros.
1304945	1305585	theme on that.
1306186	1307867	And then some Mario figurines.
1308467	1311549	And we're planning on doing some question block.
1312729	1314792	and DarkSakura.com
1334011	1338033	Yeah, a lot of it's just going to be handmade and will be really awesome.
1338073	1341255	Of course, there'll be tons of pictures for it once it does get finished.
1342255	1349859	The other thing I'm working on right now, and this is just kind of an on a whim thing that I decided to do the other day is what...
1350819	1358401	I love the phrasing Project $10 that EA's been using, you know, because they're charging people lots of money for stuff that should be in the games in the first place.
1359762	1362542	But I decided to come up with Project Under $100.
1362822	1371785	And what Project Under $100 is, is building a working main cabinet under $100.
1371825	1371905	Nice.
1373345	1396995	and that's including everything including shipping now although I'm pricing stuff out now I don't know if I can include shipping in there because it's I want to do a two-player cocktail but it might be a little difficult but basically though you know involving actually getting like an LCD monitor computer all the arcade parts and that kind of stuff under $100 it might end up being 120 we'll see
1398796	1401818	After all that stuff because, like I said, I don't want the extra buttons and joystick and stuff.
1402259	1406001	But so far I have the computer and the monitor for under $70.
1406321	1408062	So I'm off to a good start.
1408903	1413526	And the cabinet itself will be funny because it will be made out of cardboard.
1413926	1414207	Nice.
1414247	1415728	Thanks to the U.S.
1415788	1419430	Postal Service because you can get a ton of boxes from them for absolutely free.
1419450	1419570	Really?
1419590	1420631	And they will ship them to you.
1421631	1422012	Wow.
1422272	1422812	That's kind of cool.
1423293	1423613	Very cool.
1423633	1423873	Very cool.

1448225	1452169	Derek H says, if he does that, I'm assuming talking about the MAME cabinet, I'm doing it.
1452509	1456152	My MAME cabinet is an old laptop, a monitor, and an Xbox 360 controller.
1456192	1458094	Granted, I could have done a lot of stuff.
1458154	1459855	Hey, I've got some spare parts.
1459895	1460996	This doesn't cost me anything.
1461296	1470664	But I wanted it so that it can be somewhat reproducible because the problem is, though, shopping on eBay and buying used stuff, you never know what you're going to get for what price.
1470684	1472426	Ideally, you get one day.
1472466	1473026	It's not ideal.
1473046	1473847	You're going to get another day.
1474367	1476448	So I got lucky with some of that stuff.
1476468	1483272	Like I said, I got a monitor for $32, an LCD monitor, 15-inch LCD monitor that has one dead pixel, but I don't give a shit.
1483412	1485953	It's going in a cardboard cabinet, so who cares?
1487034	1499461	And I got a computer for $35 that's basically a 1.6 gigahertz processor, which is fine for MAME, and I think a half gig of RAM, which is perfect for MAME.
1499801	1500642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1522504	1527285	So I may have to supplement it with some other stuff, but I'm just kind of throwing around the idea.
1527305	1535508	We got this gift card from work for, ironically enough, selling Split Second, and so I'm using it for that.
1536228	1541570	I bet Bobby would be proud to know that you got rewarded for selling extra copies of Split Second to people.
1542350	1543130	Good job, Loki.
1543930	1544871	It's a decent game.
1545051	1546031	I mean, you know.
1547875	1549177	All right, anything else, Loki?
1567156	1567797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1584028	1584809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1613607	1620455	And I guess, actually, one thing I didn't realize, it's one of those arcades that's also participating in the Save the Arcades 2 campaign.
1621316	1624500	We had a story on that a couple weeks ago, because Arcade Infinity is also competing with this place.
1624760	1627363	Well, I gotta tell you, this place was awesome.
1627643	1634351	I had a good time, and, you know, I didn't try to talk to anybody, or I wasn't like, you know, oh, yeah, I'm from Orange Lounge Radio, I want to talk...
1634591	1635852	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1659946	1660767	Did they have a black rose?
1673365	1674465	I don't remember seeing it.
1674485	1675205	They had a lot.
1675365	1677506	They had more pinball machines than I've ever seen in an arcade.
1677526	1679086	They had a lot.
1679646	1681187	Somebody asked me if they had Space Jam.
1681207	1681987	I didn't see Space Jam.
1682027	1683027	I did see Doctor Who.
1683447	1684247	That made me think of you.
1684587	1685648	They had a Doctor Who table.
1685828	1686528	So that was pretty cool.
1687428	1694250	The only complaint I have about the place is that the games are packed in so tight because the real estate there, there's not a lot of it.
1694830	1698591	There's a lot of brushing up against strangers and not a lot of elbow room.
1698951	1700431	I gotta say, I was there on a...
1700891	1702112	Dave & Buster's got it, right?
1702132	1703052	They do all sorts of theme nights.
1727439	1755621	apparently throughout the month too and they have bands that perform there and everything so yeah I had a good time so I'm surprised and one thing and Alan said the same thing and I commented on this too is that why in the hell don't they have this in San Francisco like there's nothing like it in San Francisco and you would think of all places kind of tech central you know NorCal would have something like it but sadly it does not SSJ100Matt says that there is a barcade in New York City Brooklyn to be exact you know I think I'd heard about that
1756421	1757522	But I had not been there.
1758703	1761525	Bond006 in chat says, Did you have a geek moment?
1761565	1764206	Yes, I did have a geek moment when I went in there and squeed.
1764527	1772472	And I watched my friend, get this guys, I know long time OLR fans will appreciate this, they had a DDR Extreme machine that I watched my friend play for only 50 cents.
1772912	1773293	Good times.
1773373	1774073	And no tokens.
1774754	1776074	That was another refreshing thing.
1776315	1778096	Everything actually ran on quarters.
1778516	1781898	And they had to have signs on the machines that say, Don't use this for your laundry, buddy.
1782419	1783239	That's old school.
1783699	1784180	Good times.
1784720	1789281	So yes, A++ for ground control, and I hope there's more places that spring up like it.
1791061	1796802	As far as other games that I play that you don't have to be in Portland in order to access, I did play a couple of new games.
1797002	1803824	Since I was in Oregon, Oregon is infamous for not having sales tax, at least to those of us in California, so I loaded up on games.
1803864	1805284	I bought four new games this week.
1805404	1809345	I bought Blur, Split Second, Red Dead Redemption, and Alan Awake.
1809405	1810405	I bought all of those games.
1810965	1813106	So that I could save a little bit on sales tax because I'm cheap.
1813547	1816148	Although I bought four new video games, it wasn't that cheap.
1816949	1821051	I played two of them this week because I didn't have time to do everything and I was kind of focusing.
1821451	1824413	I probably played Blur more than any other game that I got this week.
1825334	1826975	And Blur is pretty cool.
1827115	1830297	It is exactly what they are marketing it as in the commercials.
1830377	1832578	It is Mario Kart meets Burnout.
1832818	1834559	It is Mario Kart for grown-ups.
1835660	1836881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1864821	1866422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1885191	1886952	Things they could do better in the sequel.
1887012	1889654	Because I'm pretty sure there will be a blur too.
1889934	1891315	There deserves to be a blur too.
1892336	1894757	And there are some things I would like to see them do better in the sequel.
1895257	1897219	First off, my number one complaint about the game.
1898120	1899080	The soundtrack blows.
1899981	1905244	It's non-existent in some parts, and I don't really know what the music score is.
1905784	1921732	In some parts, there's a movie in the beginning that kind of had a cool song I recognized in it that was neat, and in the opening menus, there's some cool techno songs, but you would think something with that look of blur, like the neon, the kind of like...
1922532	1931299	F-Zero but not in the future look that Blur sort of has, the Burnout meets F-Zero look, you would think has some type of techno thumping soundtrack to it, right?
1931359	1931779	Or something?
1931959	1934421	That's what Burnout had, the Burnout tracks, EA tracks.
1934841	1939285	I mean, granted, Blur is by Activision, but you would still expect there to be somewhat of a soundtrack, but it
1939965	1940606	It wasn't there.
1940666	1941886	It wasn't notable for me.
1942326	1947349	And from what I understand, they had this agreement apparently signed where I guess Crystal Method produced a soundtrack.
1947809	1950171	I was just expecting something a lot more.
1951231	1954673	I was tempted just to really use custom soundtracks the whole time.
1955813	1958835	I was very disappointed in what should have been a better soundtrack.
1959175	1962417	My other complaint is, believe it or not, the graphics are not...
1963980	1964442	Awesome!
1964602	1965645	You know, like, they're good.
1965985	1967148	They're definitely next gen.
1967670	1969374	They're a step above what you're gonna see on the Wii.
1970015	1972321	But I wasn't, like, blown away by the graphics.
1972381	1972542	Like...
1973504	1991433	Yeah, Blur has this neon thing going for it, but that neon is often mixed in many stages with Highway 50 going through Nevada, like that very brown, blah, dusty kind of theme, which I don't know what they were trying to go for with it, but it didn't make the graphics look that notable.
1991814	1995696	Honestly, the graphics were kind of comparable to Fuel, which didn't really have...
1996756	2012895	A++ graphics either so I was a little bit disappointed but in the end graphics and sound are not the only important things in a video game and the game itself is still a lot of fun and I am having fun making my way through it it is a game deserving of a sequel I'm
2013115	2015736	I hope they just put a little more polish on it next time.
2015796	2018017	That is what I would hope for.
2018858	2019678	Comments from our chatroom.
2019698	2028842	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Bond006 says, Has anyone seen the underhand slap at Ninty, Nintendo, in the Blur ad at the end?
2029122	2030503	Oh yeah, I think the Blur ad is great.
2030563	2032624	And it's really perfect for what Blur is trying to be.
2033564	2033824	Awesome.
2034505	2036866	Deathwishing says, The graphics are better than Fuel.
2036966	2037546	Trust me.
2037666	2038506	I loved Fuel.
2038967	2039487	Ha ha ha.
2039987	2040948	I liked Fuel a lot too.
2040968	2043190	I thought Fuel was severely underrated.
2043570	2047713	But Fuel was also... The biggest problem with Fuel is that it was too ambitious.
2048274	2052156	And there wasn't enough polish because the world was too big in Fuel.
2053197	2054458	That was its biggest problem.
2054738	2056420	Its ambition was its own worst enemy.
2056820	2062484	And to some extent, maybe that was the biggest problem with Blur is that they spent so much time on the game itself, which is...
2063465	2064626	Where you should spend the time.
2064666	2065126	Don't get me wrong.
2065446	2068088	I think some of the graphics and sound I think suffered a little bit.
2069148	2071169	But let me say this too because this is important.
2071650	2078013	One feature that's in Blur that I think a lot of people overlook that does make it pretty awesome and may explain why the graphics take a hit.
2078693	2081975	It does have split screen multiplayer.
2082436	2084797	So you don't just have to play this game on Xbox Live.
2085217	2088819	You can play, like Mario Kart, two people on one screen.
2089219	2090200	So that's...
2090760	2091380	Kind of cool.
2091540	2094901	So, you know, take it with a grain of salt, I suppose.
2094961	2097281	Maybe that's why they had to make some concessions with the graphics and sound.
2098222	2103483	The other game I played this week, Red Dead Redemption, which might surprise some of you guys who listen to this show.
2103503	2111164	It's not usually the type of game I would play, but the reviews on it have been so stellar, and I've read such good things on it, I'm like, I have to pick this up and know what I'm missing.
2111504	2117525	I'm going to be honest, I haven't played a whole lot of this story, because I can't stop shooting random people.
2117846	2119826	That's right, the minute they gave me a gun...
2120186	2120547	DarkSakura.com
2135183	2136464	Everybody tells me.
2136484	2139445	Dan just said the same damn thing when I walked in here.
2139585	2141026	Okay, my sister came over.
2141166	2144048	She's been playing Red Dead Redemption as well because I got her a copy.
2144668	2149510	And she just comes over and just can't stop laughing at what she's been doing.
2149850	2159115	She says one of the things that she likes doing is lassoing a coyote and dragging it into the middle of town and then letting it go because it will attack whatever it sees.
2160136	2162057	So that's pretty funny.
2162537	2164658	And then you can tie people up, throw them on the train tracks.
2164898	2165299	DarkSakura.com
2177171	2179834	Honestly, here it is with Red Dead Redemption.
2180174	2181996	It's sandbox gaming at its finest.
2182096	2182797	It really is.
2183117	2186220	If you've ever wanted that Wild West sandbox, there you go.
2186240	2186720	Grand Theft Horse.
2187081	2187641	Grand Theft Horse.
2187661	2188082	Well, it is.
2188903	2189643	It's the same engine.
2189683	2191265	It's that Rockstar engine.
2191385	2191785	Rage.
2192046	2192626	Yeah, Rage.
2192666	2193647	Their proprietary engine.
2193967	2194768	And their euphoria.
2194928	2197371	Tigerclaw says, wow, Sky is sadistic.
2197431	2198652	Very uncharacteristic of you.
2198732	2199373	Dude, I just...
2199893	2203094	I don't play these games an awful lot, but when I do, it's really funny.
2203174	2204915	Like, I don't take it seriously.
2204975	2206236	Like, you guys know how I feel.
2206836	2209597	I know a lot of you guys must be kind of like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2209697	2213719	Isn't Rob the same guy who went off on the Saw movies and how he doesn't like them because they're too violent?
2214199	2216340	Well, yeah, but Saw's kind of, like, realistic.
2216540	2221702	And, like, Red Dead Redemption, like, the graphics are good and all, but it's not realistic.
2221902	2222422	You know what I mean?
2222862	2223643	There's a difference.
2223663	2224563	There's a huge difference.
2225283	2226204	I can't explain it.
2226224	2228865	And if it makes me a hypocrite, well, screw you.
2230326	2233849	SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, what would your mother say about this?
2234029	2234429	Rob!
2235210	2236691	That's just gross, Rob.
2236871	2238212	My mom said we could call her, by the way.
2238412	2238613	Really?
2238653	2239373	We're going to have to do that.
2239393	2240174	I don't know if we should do it tonight.
2240194	2240854	I'm going to say next week.
2241055	2241795	We should, yeah.
2242976	2246359	Let's do it after E3 because I think the next week is the Microsoft thing.
2246459	2248080	But definitely in the near future.
2248681	2250022	We will make that work.
2251618	2255700	Kitsune says, Red Dead Redemption feels so much more fun than Grand Theft Auto 4 though.
2256020	2257901	You know, I kind of agree.
2258101	2259581	I don't know what it is, Kitsune.
2259822	2260822	I feel the same thing.
2260842	2272527	There's something about it where I don't know if it's just the environment or it's just the story or I just get drawn into Red Dead Redemption a lot more than I do Grand Theft Auto 4.
2273267	2273568	I don't know.
2273908	2277629	Deathwishing in chat says, Rob, I got mauled by 13 cougars at once.
2278150	2279210	That's awesome.
2279290	2280991	I was instantly thinking of...
2281591	2283752	I was instantly thinking of Courtney Cox and Cougar Town.
2284152	2284672	Is it just me?
2285392	2287353	I was thinking of Blanche.
2288953	2290174	Rest in peace, Blanche.
2290434	2291494	I know.
2291674	2293775	I miss those old broads.
2294395	2296595	But Betty White has outlasted them all.
2296615	2296936	That's right.
2296956	2297796	There can be only one.
2298716	2300757	Betty White has proved she's the HBIC.
2300878	2301358	That's right.
2302418	2304360	Okay, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.
2304380	2306041	We are literally 40 minutes into the show.
2306061	2307281	I haven't touched a damn bit of news.
2307642	2309163	So let me do some quick housekeeping, guys.
2309623	2311784	There's some new articles at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2312164	2314546	There's been some great, great retro reviews.
2315146	2340420	Retro rear views written in the past couple weeks RBI Baseball's got some gameplay there's a story on Metal Gear a new segment that's being done by Actdeft called Video Stumble which is kind of neat so check that out guys our website is expanding with all this kind of retro-ish content and I thought that was really cool I also uploaded some pics from my Portland trip if you want to see the picture of the Burger Time machine and the OLR initials I put those up at OrangeLandry.com so check those out
2341541	2357790	I also want to give a plug maybe I'll let Jamie plug this but she wrote a great article on our friend website I don't want to say our sister website but our BFF website we'll say that our BFF at geek-life.com tell them a little bit about what you did DarkSakura
2357990	2366074	Well, I have... Actually, I have a regular panel on there every week on Tuesday that's called Geek Cube.
2367075	2370617	Talking about, you know, how to incorporate your geeky life with your work life.
2372357	2373958	But I also write other articles.
2373978	2377580	Like, I did a review of this place called Fairytale Town for little kids.
2378381	2384424	But I also did a write-up for Orange Sounds Radio since we get a nice big plug on the website.
2384924	2386145	And, you know, so...
2389268	2394114	I just basically kind of did the not-so-secret origin of Orange Dolls Radio.
2394134	2403366	Well, it was a historical type of thing and kind of went through how we evolved from the show that was on the living room floor about DDR and 2DX to the show we are today.
2403426	2403967	It was pretty cool.
2404487	2410571	I mean, and really it's the question, you know, we get asked it fairly often, like, how'd you come up with that name?
2410691	2412993	And how'd you come up with this?
2413033	2413933	And how long have you been doing this?
2413993	2414734	And what was it like?
2414774	2415354	And blah, blah, blah.
2415795	2423179	And there's a few of you who've been here since, you know, episode one, which I think are all in this room and two people in chat.
2423199	2423399	Yeah.
2424640	2437525	So, but, you know, I really just wanted to go through and sort of give, you know, the little origin story, how we evolved, how we've gotten to where we are now.
2438263	2442885	By the way, I hear DarkSakura might not be the only OLR host writing something for Geek Life.
2446166	2446886	I'll give you a hint.
2446966	2447607	It's not me.
2450027	2454849	Well, just to go ahead and do the call out, we are looking for people to contribute content.
2456210	2464413	Just basically go to geek-life.com and we have a little link on there for submissions so you can submit to our will.
2464753	2465154	All of those kids.
2474978	2478321	But yeah, keep a look out because, you know.
2479022	2482164	And also, you may see a few things cross-posted.
2482965	2483385	Very cool.
2483746	2486108	I'm actually going to have an interview up on the site next week.
2486568	2487169	Next week, I hope.
2487789	2488450	Interview, interview.
2488470	2500300	With Jim McCann, who wrote New Avengers The Reunion and is writing the current Hawkeye Mockingbird and the Dazzler one-shot that was fabulous.
2500720	2501941	Geek Life Indeed.
2502822	2504363	Emphasis on geek.
2504903	2506865	He's just a really, really cool person.
2507045	2507725	Sounds like fun.
2509046	2509327	Alright.
2509487	2511588	Geek-life.com The dash is important.
2511608	2512749	What happens if they don't put the dash in?
2512769	2513390	Do they get porn?
2513910	2514370	Probably.
2515636	2517638	Geek porn, could you imagine?
2539181	2542203	Alright, hey, I want to mention this too, because I got asked about this earlier tonight.
2542583	2548386	I don't have a lot to say on this yet, but we were asked, apparently All Games Radio is putting together this thing called The Big Battle.
2548987	2550868	And I was asked if we are participating.
2551028	2560273	I literally found out about this today, but from what I understand in a nutshell, it is a bunch of the shows at All Games Radio kind of getting together.
2560573	2565036	And it's kind of one of those things, like when you hear the idea, you're kind of like, this should have been done like two years ago.
2565076	2566257	Like, how obvious is this?
2566597	2568278	And why haven't we done something like this a while ago?
2568678	2588577	but props, I don't know who is spearheading this, I think it might be DeadPixelLive, I don't know, but props to them for putting it on it's going to kind of bring the all games community together in big battles on games I can't 100% for sure confirm our participation yet, because I have to talk to DarkSakura and Loki after the show, see what we can do but
2589858	2590619	Why wouldn't we?
2590719	2591299	I mean, really.
2591699	2601745	I'm all about trying to promote the All Games Network and other shows, and I think a lot of our greatest listeners come from the cross-pollination of the shows.
2602125	2606908	And I've always said, I realize Orange Lounge Radio is not for everybody.
2607028	2610630	There's some games we just don't really talk about here on this show, like Madden.
2610750	2612411	Actually, we have a Madden story tonight, funny enough.
2612791	2615012	Usually we don't talk a lot about the sports games like Madden.
2615292	2616313	But there's other shows on the network...
2616733	2618514	Hey, talk about that a lot.
2618994	2622915	And they probably would go, DDR, what are those guys doing?
2623195	2628036	So if you don't like us, surely there's another show on the network that caters to your interest.
2628056	2629217	So I'm definitely all about that.
2629537	2631237	So sure, I'm sure we're going to participate.
2631337	2634818	It's just a matter of figuring out what games we'll actually be able to play.
2635138	2636499	However, as I understand it,
2637119	2639460	This is not just a host versus host thing.
2639981	2642883	This is a listener versus listener thing.
2643483	2650287	So we're gonna need you, OL Army, to sign up and represent us in some of these games.
2650827	2654450	So I will hopefully have more details for you on that next week.
2654690	2657852	Again, I'm not confirming our participation, but I'm just saying.
2658672	2659793	It's probably going to happen.
2660314	2660574	All right.
2660874	2663417	Anyhow, hopefully I didn't say too much on that.
2664198	2668242	But somebody asked in chat earlier, and I think the All Games folks know what's going on, so whatevs.
2669343	2673427	Also, the other thing I want to plug, E3 is coming up next week.
2673487	2674268	Believe it or not.
2675489	2677311	E3 is kind of starting on a Sunday this year.
2677331	2678112	I mean, not officially.
2678152	2679834	The show itself does not start on a Tuesday.
2680194	2689783	But while our show is going on, did you guys know, at I think about 8 o'clock Pacific, I could have the time wrong, but that is Xbox, Microsoft's
2690336	2719494	Project Natal Cirque du Soleil show is a week from right now so we're actually going to be here we will be doing a show we may cut live to the press conference if we can get some coverage we will figure out how we can do that I don't know if it's going to be much besides a show I don't know what's all involved with that but we will try to figure that out and bring you that live next week also here live next week speaking of old school OLR an old familiar guest of the show Miklatov is going to be here because he's going to E3 with me
2720574	2723596	We don't leave until Monday night, so we will be here Sunday.
2723656	2726097	We are not going to miss any OLR because of E3.
2726437	2729739	In fact, there might be bonus OLR on the feed.
2730279	2745766	I wouldn't see why myself and Miklatov and maybe Loki and DarkSakura via phone, depending on what we can do, or at least Bobby Blackwolf, I'm sure, if he's not too busy with all his appointments, will do some little mini-podcasts that will go to the feed during E3.
2746266	2746887	So that'll be fun.
2748187	2752009	Loki, I know you'll be hitting refresh on the sites non-stop Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
2752489	2754470	Now here's what I'm going to be doing during the week.
2754710	2758312	And this is sad because I'm not very productive during E3.
2758872	2762194	I watch the live conferences at my desk.
2763954	2764455	Good times.
2765175	2768837	Or I refresh on four different live feeds at once.
2768957	2771058	I'd like to be able to stream it on my iPhone.
2773061	2774102	You might be able to.
2774942	2778805	Our internet's that crappy at work, so why not?
2779546	2781307	Alright, lots of housekeeping.
2781447	2783748	Now we can finally get to gaming news.
2783829	2784489	Hooray!
2784789	2785209	Gaming news.
2785270	2786951	Oh yeah, and Facebook.
2787091	2787771	Add us on Facebook.
2787791	2789573	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2789913	2791474	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2791534	2792435	Have I named everything?
2792495	2793155	I think I have.
2793655	2796197	Let's get into the freaking show already.
2796677	2798659	Loki, what is going on in gaming news?
2799056	2802478	You know, I guess I could take time off during E3, too, because I do have a lot of time off.
2803298	2805559	You should have just gone to the... Well, you got your wife and the baby.
2805579	2807220	She would not let me go to E3.
2807280	2809441	She's having nightmares about me going to E3.
2809481	2813723	Well, not nightmares, but dreams of which she is mad at me afterwards.
2813963	2814343	I know.
2814543	2814823	Oh, well.
2815464	2815984	Maybe next year.
2816124	2817965	Yeah, next... Well... Maybe not.
2818145	2819185	Maybe in three years.
2819626	2819886	Never.
2822678	2848451	So anyways, there's a rumor going around that Harmonix is working on a dancing game for Natal And this is becoming, I guess, obvious due to some licenses that they are acquiring for different danceable tracks Including Cascadas, Evacuate the Dance Floor, Timberlands, The Way I Are Wait a minute, this came up a couple weeks ago, I think, some of these licensing things So now we've got clarity to what it's being used for?
2848971	2852276	Well, they're just guessing, I think, based on the fact that it's danceable music.
2852937	2854098	I'm hoping for a DJ game.
2854258	2856782	I remember that Timbaland thing coming up before.
2857082	2859846	So I think some of this is just... But I don't remember Cascada.
2859866	2860928	I would have remembered something like that.
2861368	2861769	Interesting.
2862071	2875015	Yeah, and they're not really saying... This is coming also from Game Informer, the rumor that they're working on a dancing game.
2875295	2878516	You know what, it makes sense if you think about it, because what game...
2879577	2883020	Last Fall was just incredibly popular.
2883040	2889465	In fact, I think it's still popular now that I would have never pegged to be at the top of some of these selling lists.
2889946	2895771	And that would be Just Dance from Ubisoft, which is basically a game where you dance around to cues on the screen.
2896491	2900455	And it makes sense that you would use this for Natal or something.
2902105	2902465	I don't know.
2902625	2904086	I mean, it's not a big surprise to me.
2904266	2913472	And I'm sure with Natal and probably the same with the move, you're going to see lots of these really gimmicky things that we have had forever.
2913832	2918675	Yeah, but I mean, Loki, to be fair, that gimmicky game is kind of the roots of our show.
2918775	2920797	I mean, DDR was a bit of a gimmicky game.
2920837	2921237	I understand.
2921277	2927581	I get that, Loki, but here's the place where I have a little more hope than I do with all the rest of that, is the fact that Harmonix is rumored to be tied into this.
2927601	2927761	Harmonix...
2948513	2951174	I'm trying to think here, have they ever made a bad music game?
2951214	2953075	Just a straight up bad music game.
2954396	2955156	I can't think of one.
2955616	2959018	Maybe the chatters will jump in, but Harmonix makes pretty good games.
2959838	2968602	Well, the first Guitar Hero was revolutionary, and so the second one was good too, and then they jumped ship and made Rock Band.
2968923	2971744	They didn't have anything to do with the third thereafter, remember that?
2972164	2973205	So, I mean, Harmonix...
2974285	2976527	The fact that they're involved gives me a little more hope.
2976567	2981631	I mean, if you think about it, Rock Band 3, I mean, how much more programming is Rock Band 3 going to take?
2981691	2989396	I mean, it's probably just the Beatles and Green Day Engine souped up a little more with the keyboard, whatever's put in, a little more something, something there.
2989877	2992458	There's probably something else being cooked up over there.
2992538	2995240	This makes perfect sense that this would be it.
2996302	2999787	Who's to say that it's not necessarily a game like DDR?
2999808	3008222	If Natal is supposed to be this magic thing that knows where you are in the room, it could work just like DDR with no dance pad.
3011508	3014510	That's going to look weird if it works like, I don't know.
3014770	3017471	I think it's just going to be just like Just Dance.
3017772	3022354	I mean, it's probably not going to be any more elaborate than that.
3023095	3027177	It'll just be interesting because you'll be able to do multiplayer and that kind of stuff.
3027457	3034201	And it'll be more accurate because it's using a camera instead of just sensors and a close approximation of whatever you're doing.
3034341	3041426	Maybe the joke is that these are actually tracks for Rock Band 3 because Rock Band 3 will also be incorporating dancers.
3042854	3044655	or maybe they're working on a DJ game.
3045795	3046255	Perhaps.
3046315	3047735	Because they never said anything.
3047935	3050496	They're just saying, oh, it's going to be a Natal-based dance game.
3051196	3060859	And I don't know if they're just guessing because, you know, Natal coming out soon and the fact that those types of games have done well in the past and also because these are danceable tracks.
3061459	3064740	I mean, there's a lot of speculation going on unless they know something that we don't, but...
3067236	3072920	Being the expert analyst that I am, I'm sure it'll be something gimmicky.
3073460	3076902	Miklatov is actually in our chatroom tonight, and he says, Rock Band Unplugged sucked.
3077443	3080225	Well, I mean, opinion is relative or whatever, but I actually disagree.
3080285	3088430	I think Rock Band Unplugged, it wasn't Rock Band, it was Frequency Amplitude PSP with rock songs, but I didn't think it was bad at all.
3088870	3091712	And actually, the really cool thing about that game, remember, it was totally free.
3092253	3094334	The demo would work with the download songs, remember that?
3094834	3095015	Yep.
3095275	3095895	Good times.
3097416	3099238	I think he's thinking Dance Maniacs.
3116115	3117818	I'm going to be honest, I hope not.
3118098	3124327	I mean, don't get me wrong, I like Dance Maniacs for what it was, but it's a little bit gimmicky, and I think it's a $60 game.
3124347	3125869	The technology's old.
3126049	3127291	I just don't see it.
3128024	3136008	And the technology's old and they're not going to do anything like that anymore because now you can do full dancing games because they have all these fun sensors that they can use.
3136328	3140110	Couldn't they do better things with a Dance Maniacs style soundtrack?
3140250	3141651	I think that's what we should be looking for.
3142111	3146593	I think we, especially as music game fans, I mean, OLR's been on for, what, eight years?
3147033	3147994	And DDR was started in 1998?
3148074	3153776	I mean, we've really got to start looking forward, not trying to emulate what's happened in the past.
3154156	3156838	And this is where Konami is failing miserably, by the way.
3157578	3174367	what happened to DDR out of Konami I mean I don't want to spoil a story that's coming up later in the show but we're going to be talking about the games that are going to be shown at E3 this year I noticed DDR was not on the list from Konami I'm starting to wonder if that project was cancelled enter Harmonix just like they did with Guitar Hero
3176683	3178324	Time to start looking forward with our music game.
3178344	3181585	I just don't understand how they can screw that up so much.
3181685	3189027	I mean, the problem, I think, with DDR is they need new blood in the game, basically.
3189067	3197469	They need someone like myself to come in and just completely overhaul the damn game because what they're doing now, it's just not working.
3198730	3199610	So, they need...
3201033	3202735	Go back to square one.
3203255	3212265	Maybe game companies, and maybe I'm giving this with too few examples, but maybe game companies are finally kind of starting to listen to what the fans want a little bit.
3212846	3216129	And so Harmonix is like, gosh, the DDR fans kind of want something new.
3216209	3216590	Here you go.
3216890	3218892	Just like the Blur people were like, gee...
3219953	3221815	People want a burnout Mario Kart game.
3221915	3222435	Here you go.
3222536	3223456	You know, like, I don't know.
3223476	3223997	Maybe it's just me.
3224417	3227360	It seems like there seems to be a lot more fan service.
3227740	3235387	You're hearing a lot more, too, about like old ass games coming back from the dead on the iPhone or on DS.
3235487	3236989	And you've seen that a lot lately.
3237009	3237129	Yeah.
3237589	3238470	Unless it's Earthbound.
3238830	3239971	Happy birthday, by the way, Earthbound.
3240111	3254780	It's smart that they do listen to their fans, the people that are buying their games, to make stuff that they intend on purchasing instead of, you know, oh, I don't know, let's recreate Karaoke Revolution again.
3256232	3267563	Yeah, I remember that because now instead of calling it Karaoke Revolution 4 or whatever the hell number they were up to, oh, they're just going to re-release this or release a new game called Karaoke Revolution and it's not going to be very different.
3268063	3272347	It's supposed to have had all this support with download content, but that never happened.
3272548	3279234	So I just can't buy what Konami's selling nowadays.
3280353	3280894	I mean, I don't know.
3280914	3281274	We'll see.
3281475	3283638	Well, E3 could surprise us.
3283658	3290067	Take the Castlevania because apparently that Castlevania game, the multiplayer one, you know, is really legit and it should be super awesome.
3291125	3297528	No, I mean, the Silent Hill game got some good feedback on the Wii.
3297568	3306953	Konami's got some hype points, but there's just, unfortunately, for those of us that liked a certain aspect of what they were doing many years ago, that is no longer one of their hype points.
3307013	3311175	You need to bring the Silent Hill and the Metal Gear Solid arcade games to the Wii.
3312096	3315678	Or, actually, now you can bring them out to the PS3 and the Xbox 360, because...
3316758	3317439	That'd be awesome.
3317699	3318881	Take a cue from Sega.
3318961	3320023	Look at House of Dead 2 and 3.
3320663	3321905	Awesome games, sold well.
3322586	3325069	Take a cue from that company who's doing The Rock of the Dead.
3325129	3326091	That's even cooler.
3328015	3334120	I take offense to Capcom making Marvel vs. Capcom 3 I enjoyed 10 years of utter arrogance in telling my friends there will never be Marvel vs. Capcom 3
3354355	3356299	Four words, never say never ever
3365419	3367020	If DC and Marvel can hook up, anything's possible.
3390171	3391532	Bionic Commando Rearmed.
3391572	3392652	That's all I have to say.
3392912	3394072	That was awesome.
3394573	3397574	Sin and Punishment Sky Successor from Rei Ayanami in chat.
3397594	3398034	That's true.
3398134	3408538	That Sin and Punishment game's all... And you know what's sad about that is it's not going to sell well and it's going to be considered probably a failure on Nintendo's part and you won't see that many games like that.
3408558	3409498	Big words, Loki.
3409558	3412039	What's to say that?
3412079	3412659	Why you say that?
3412859	3417761	Because every single mature or niche game on the Wii has not sold well.
3419853	3448156	all of them think about this topic for next week I don't want to get into it tonight because we're running a little long anyway but just think about this topic for next week and write it down mentally in case I forget because I want to go through the different three press conferences and I want to kind of ask this question and maybe this is a good email topic too if those of you guys want to email us this week mailbagorangeandre.com because we're going to talk a lot pre E3 next week what could the big three do Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft at their press conferences to make you a rabid fanboy all over again
3449737	3452120	Silly answers are fine, but give me some serious ones too.
3452140	3456905	I'm going to tell you right now what Sony's got to do, and it's so simple, it's so obvious.
3456945	3459047	Alright, alright, but now I want to change topics because I don't want to ruin next week.
3459168	3466936	And I feel really bad for not knowing the guy's name, but the guy that they have in their commercials right now needs to be running that damn conference.
3468502	3468802	Really?
3469263	3469443	Yeah.
3469683	3470044	Interesting.
3470104	3474869	He's the best marketing campaign ever for Sony.
3475770	3476671	I would actually agree.
3477111	3483619	For a company that's had lots of missteps, lots of missteps, remember the black and white PSP?
3483819	3484520	Yeah, remember that?
3484620	3484820	Yeah.
3485060	3487583	Remember the God of War lamb being served up?
3487663	3487823	Yeah.
3488644	3489965	Remember the crane, baby?
3490046	3490206	Yeah.
3491804	3493587	This is a direction they should stick with.
3493847	3494588	I'll give you that.
3494708	3495589	I totally agree.
3495890	3497392	And I'm sure that guy will be at E3.
3497432	3499935	Yeah, Kevin Butler, I think, was his name or whatever.
3500235	3501517	He'll be there.
3504119	3505460	And our chat is lighting up.
3505500	3506741	Kevin Butler, he's great.
3506801	3508042	He's the man, says Blaze.
3508562	3509683	Black Wolf says he's an actor.
3509723	3510744	I hope he does the intro.
3511224	3511764	I don't care.
3511904	3512665	I just hope he's there.
3513445	3514106	We'll see what happens.
3514426	3515587	All right, let's move on, though, guys.
3515627	3516247	We'll talk a little more.
3516267	3518028	I hope he's in every press conference.
3519449	3521511	Here's one of the rumors about what's going to be seen.
3521611	3525634	Big, big, fat rumor, but it's kind of one of those rumors you look at and go, okay, I could see that.
3526394	3532458	Apparently, Hulu is being teased as a possible addition to the Xbox 360.
3532518	3536140	This is coming from Gear Live, which is a tech site.
3536640	3541603	Apparently, they have picked up on a rumor that Hulu's streaming functionality is going to be in the Xbox 360.
3541943	3544305	It's going to be announced at E3.
3544465	3551409	1Up ran with the same rumor, saying that a Hulu application for the Xbox 360 definitely exists, but the problem right now...
3551909	3554230	It's tied up with rights issues.
3556431	3559373	Everybody wants a piece of the rights to the application.
3559933	3560614	What do you guys think?
3560734	3561414	Hulu on the 360.
3562275	3564916	Again, for those of you that don't know Hulu, Hulu's a website.
3564996	3566237	It was kind of launched to say...
3567177	3567798	How much is that?
3590094	3591935	I know, it's awesome that it's there.
3591975	3596836	I mean, prepare to be disappointed by the cliffhanger ending because the show got canceled midway through.
3597276	3601518	But, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff like that that I think would be a great addition to the Xbox 360.
3601858	3602458	What do you guys think?
3602558	3603578	Fact or crap?
3604018	3604499	Hulu on the 360.
3604819	3606599	I think it definitely could happen.
3606879	3607440	It makes sense.
3607800	3608540	I think it could happen.
3609458	3614142	Going off the old standby that all rumors are in fact true, I could see it happening too.
3615163	3617565	It's just a good alternative to Netflix.
3617625	3623489	The thing I didn't like though is they were saying that they were going to possibly charge more money to access Hulu on the 360.
3624650	3635759	Which, if that's the case, that's retarded because, I mean, if you just use your PC and stream your PC to your 360, you can watch Hulu for free.
3636040	3637701	So why should I have to pay extra money?
3637941	3640663	Bochikawa in our chat says, yeah, all the consoles have internets.
3640783	3642404	Why couldn't you watch them on it already?
3642504	3645106	Well, I don't believe... They block it.
3645627	3647708	Yeah, it's blocked on the PS3, right?
3647768	3650110	And then I don't think the Wii has a high enough flash version.
3650150	3652492	And the Xbox 360, don't forget, it's missing a web browser.
3653072	3655834	I know a lot of people think, just assume, oh yeah, I can surf the web on my 360.
3656115	3657256	Actually, you can't.
3658076	3661919	It makes sense why they don't do that, because there's already enough holes in their security.
3662239	3662439	Yeah.
3664181	3688118	and Wyland in our chatroom says if you want Dark Shadows watch the original 1245 episodes bring them to Hulu and maybe I'll start although from what I understand you don't really start watching Dark Shadows until about episode 75 or whenever Barnabas is finally actually first introduced you can just kind of skip the first few that's what I'm understanding anyway but I could be wrong alright
3689720	3700596	Anyhow, so it sounds like it could be a fact we will find out in a week Because if it's not announced at E3 then it's not coming this year, that's for sure DarkSakura, what you got for us?
3701371	3713195	Well, this is more Xbox news, but basically, Robbie Bach, who is the entertainment dude, is retiring.
3714436	3718277	There was a memo that went out that said that he is retiring.
3718777	3720298	The memo was out by Steve Ballmer.
3721038	3726860	And also, Jay Allard is going to be retiring as well.
3728052	3736219	You gotta wonder if that means like retiring, like the little quotes there, like retiring, or having their butt pushed out the door.
3736419	3738680	Like, you know, there's always that kind of like, hmm.
3739101	3742083	Because I mean, it's not like, I don't think Jay Allard is 65.
3742183	3743564	He's not quite of that retirement age yet.
3743584	3747888	But they've just been there for a while and basically Xbox is printing money.
3749750	3753711	Although, weren't they tied to a failure that Xbox had?
3753772	3754772	Wasn't there something?
3755232	3760514	Not Xbox, I take it that Microsoft was supposed to launch, was it a tablet computer or something?
3760834	3761534	Something like that.
3761554	3769217	Yeah, that didn't do, and I'm sure someone in chat will jump in, that didn't, I don't think ended up happening at all, and now it's everybody's iPad, iPad, iPad.
3769617	3771898	So, I mean, it's just not going to happen there at Microsoft.
3772518	3774119	So, there it is.
3774139	3776520	I wonder how they thought they could compete with Apple over that.
3778395	3791692	Some of our people in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Guest 9595, I wish you'd change their name so I could give them proper credit, but Guest 9595 says, Hey, can't you watch Hulu and stuff with PlayOn for any of the systems?
3791732	3795937	That's right, that little software that lets you transfer your...
3797959	3799400	stuff over to the TV, right?
3799881	3801162	Well, I mean, there's that.
3801862	3803724	I prefer diversity.
3804004	3805245	I mean, you can stream Hulu.
3805405	3808788	I use my PS3 to do that, and that works really well.
3809088	3814793	So, I mean, it works just the same on a 360, but yeah, you can do that, and that's what I'm saying.
3815233	3816094	Why should I pay the extra?
3816474	3820277	The thing I'm guessing is it's going to be HD streaming, maybe, and you're going to get...
3821758	3828943	One of the rumors was they're going to start charging for Hulu if you want to watch some of the archive episodes.
3829363	3835687	The recent episodes will be free, but the stuff past the first or second... Well, that's at the website now, isn't it?
3835727	3839270	You can watch the last five episodes of Glee, but if you want to watch anything older than that, you can't.
3839650	3842612	Yeah, but they're going to allow you to, but you're going to have to bill the pay.
3844153	3845874	Good thing I don't want to watch any episodes of that.
3846915	3847836	Well, you're missing out.
3849377	3851458	And that's how Sue sees it.
3852290	3852650	Hmm?
3852710	3853051	Maybe?
3883737	3903301	You know, and I'm just, and we're going to get into some Project $10 stuff soon, but just to kind of talk about it, I'm mad at the idea of it, and the reason I'm mad at the idea is not necessarily that it affects me, it affects a lot of other people, because me personally, I either buy new games or I don't buy the games.
3904441	3906882	Not necessarily that I wouldn't buy used games, but
3908638	3919847	I mean, if there's a game that I don't think I'm going to be playing, I probably won't pick it up just because I know myself and I know that if I buy a game that I'm not so hot on, I won't end up playing it.
3920568	3922229	I'll just be sitting collecting dust.
3922570	3925352	So, for me, it's not such a big deal.
3926893	3935420	But, you know, if you just let one thing slide, then it's just going to be a whole mess of crap that's going to come out later on.
3936081	3936361	So...
3937742	3943466	That's why I'm kind of pissed off that EA is doing the whole Project $10 thing and then now THQ is following suit with that.
3943747	3948050	And as I rumored last week, Microsoft will be probably following suit with that as well.
3948450	3952913	And if Microsoft does it, then we'll have other people doing it.
3953434	3953814	Why not?
3953854	3954294	Go for it.
3954334	3955475	You want to talk more Project $10.
3955615	3957637	Who else is going to join in?
3957817	3964542	Sega is considering joining some sort of online pass system.
3964742	3966103	This is me scolding Sega.
3966744	3967004	Sega!
3968903	3981210	and, you know, basically Ubisoft is also kind of liking the idea and Sega is saying, you know, it's a very clever idea and they're certainly taking looks to see what happens with it.
3981931	3994638	And they're saying, of course, you know, that they want to be careful to make sure that, you know, the EA, you know, sports thing that they're doing right now actually works out and, you know, the backlash isn't too big and,
3995338	4000843	But if it ends up working out for them, then perhaps they will allow you to... They will do something very similar.
4002444	4009530	What's kind of funny, though, is we were talking about the whole online pass thing and the Project $10 stuff with EA.
4010051	4020339	And one of the theories was they wanted to kind of put this out there so that they can make some money from used sales and also it may curb a little bit of the piracy because the fact that if you...
4022401	4022723	and DarkSakura.
4029409	4030289	That might be one reason.
4030890	4045976	But then EA's, I guess, UK general manager, Keith Ramsdale, basically made a comment and said, no, actually the Project $10 online pass are not about that.
4046596	4049458	It's all about the customer and improving their experience.
4050238	4055360	It's simply not a defensive measure against pre-owned or piracy.
4055420	4057301	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
4057641	4059541	I'm sorry, my bullshit meter was going off.
4061862	4066123	I mean... If that isn't a bunch of corporate speak.
4066783	4069864	Improving the customer experience through... Come on.
4070164	4071004	That's retarded, then.
4071164	4075925	I would rather they come out and say, yeah, it's actually the curb piracy and used sales.
4076325	4086147	Because now the fact that you're saying no, it's actually just to make your online play even better, but the online play isn't changing, then that just means, no, you're actually just grabbing at money.
4086807	4093214	at least, you know, give it the, you know, excuse that, oh, we're actually just trying to make some money off of used sales.
4093314	4095196	Actually, don't even bother with the used sales.
4095216	4097318	Just say you're just using it to combat piracy.
4097899	4100762	I mean, because everybody is like, oh, okay, piracy, that makes sense.
4101302	4101943	But, um, I...
4103985	4107206	I'm sorry, I don't play a lot of EA games.
4107806	4109667	At least not the sports stuff.
4111027	4118150	I'm guessing, just looking at this stuff, that Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, when it's coming out on Tuesday here...
4118576	4124118	I'm guessing that the online play is not going to be that different from Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10.
4124438	4126939	And by all means, people should really look into that.
4126999	4136563	Because if this is their claim that, oh, we're doing this to the benefit of, you know, our consumers, then you need to look at... I think you should write a comparison for OrangeLawnTrader.com.
4136583	4139064	I don't want to play Tiger Woods 10 or 11.
4139644	4140745	Scour on the internet.
4140765	4143726	Don't you need access to games through your job or something?
4146348	4146489	No.
4146869	4153637	So they need to look at X and XI to see, okay, was X the latency better in XI?
4154017	4156300	Is the options better in XI?
4156780	4160124	And all this stuff, because I bet you if you look at that,
4161025	4161525	It's not.
4161746	4164468	I bet you it's the same damn shit all over again.
4164628	4171813	And it really doesn't make any sense that they're charging people they're buying used for these games because they've already gotten the money for these games.
4171853	4174194	There's no reason they need more money for these games.
4174775	4180199	You're not adding more users to the online because this is still one copy of a game that's floating around out there.
4180519	4181540	You've already made your money.
4181620	4188144	So if you can't run your infrastructure on the money they've made on new games...
4189385	4190426	It just doesn't make any sense.
4190446	4202691	Because what if, which is, it's not going to happen, but what if, you know, say, you know, this whole online pass thing ends up flopping and you're not making any money for, you know, the online games.
4202731	4206572	People aren't paying to play online more than that seven-day trial.
4207533	4208633	Then nothing changes.
4208653	4209594	Then nothing changes.
4209614	4215056	Yeah, because that's not going to motivate them to get rid of it because they're still going to make money off new games.
4215316	4215736	Exactly.
4215896	4220759	And if you think about it, though, what are they hoping to accomplish by this?
4220779	4230724	They're hoping that people either buy the game new or they're going to basically hope that they pay the $10 or whatever, $5 to actually play online.
4231184	4235947	But if people don't pay that and they don't receive enough revenue, then guess what?
4235987	4238708	The online experience doesn't change at all.
4239188	4242670	So basically making their whole point, you know,
4244504	4272999	you know, nonsense because if they're not making money from this extra use sales and using it to improve their service then they're full of shit alright let's move on with another story because this is like three weeks in a row we've talked about this stupid thing it's because it's dumb I know, I know something new is coming up every week and sadly we're probably going to hear even more about it at E3 and what other companies are going to jump on board yippee yippee
4274039	4286590	Speaking of things that are full of bullshit, somebody has filed a lawsuit against Sony and Square Enix because Final Fantasy XIII caused severe and widespread damage to PlayStation 3 consoles.
4287350	4289152	It was filed by Daniel Wolff.
4289232	4292595	It's a class action lawsuit, meaning if he wins, you'll all get a piece of this.
4293215	4306799	Wolf reckons that it freezes PlayStation 3s and when you play this, you can get your PS3 console to become totally and permanently inoperable.
4307799	4315101	The lawsuit says both defendants are eminently aware of the damage being caused by their defective products and have chosen to do nothing about it.
4316001	4321724	They're being sued, I guess, for over $5 million in damages and relief is being sought.
4321824	4329008	Meaning that if you are affected by you having both of these things, you could get your very own coupon for $5 in the mail.
4329068	4331129	That'll probably be the piece of this that you're entitled to.
4331489	4333550	That's usually what happens with these class action lawsuits.
4334590	4335131	Whatever.
4335291	4335571	I mean...
4336291	4338532	It doesn't make any sense because it's not widespread.
4338772	4339652	I know.
4339672	4344674	Did Xbox ever have to settle for the Red Rings of Death thing?
4345074	4348115	Because in my opinion, that was a much bigger problem.
4348315	4352836	I think that's why they extended the warranty to three years, I thought.
4353817	4354537	But I could be wrong.
4354577	4357198	But it doesn't matter because this isn't widespread.
4358513	4361695	Where are your data on this?
4361855	4363016	I mean, where is the data?
4363096	4367519	Seriously, because... Rob, you own Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3.
4367819	4370922	Is your PS3 inoperable because of Final Fantasy XIII?
4371062	4372843	No, but there was that one day.
4373663	4376365	Like, what, March 1st or whatever, when all the clocks were fucked up?
4376405	4376846	Remember that?
4378747	4381909	But that wouldn't be because of Final Fantasy XIII, since it came out after that.
4382810	4383090	So...
4384907	4386669	I mean, I don't know.
4386809	4390251	I would think that that would be hard to prove in the first place.
4390992	4397257	That there is widespread damage because it's like a dude, you know, saying, oh, my system crashed.
4398018	4403963	By the way, just randomly asking this question, how many of you remember the one day that the PS3s were down?
4404043	4405924	Because I bet most of you forgot.
4406064	4408006	And that was only about three months ago.
4409307	4409867	Just saying.
4411268	4412509	But there was that, remember that one day?
4412910	4413951	Yeah, I remember that one day.
4419331	4423132	We should do that every week.
4423192	4425592	We should have like, hey, you know, in case you forgot.
4426793	4428313	We'll have a statement called never forget.
4428353	4429153	Never forget.
4432354	4433274	Never forget.
4434114	4436435	Remember that time that Namco's really pissed off at us?
4436895	4437495	Never forget.
4442210	4442750	I don't like it, man.
4442770	4445171	We're full of ideas this month.
4445271	4445972	I like that.
4446032	4448873	I think that should be a segment that we do regularly.
4448913	4449673	Never forget.
4450313	4450874	Never.
4451414	4452634	It should be never forget.
4452695	4453455	Never forget.
4453535	4454255	Never forget.
4454415	4456476	Or no, we should do that on the website.
4456556	4457056	There you go.
4457517	4460958	Oh, that is a wonderful idea for a series of articles.
4461438	4464099	Is there an OLR fan that maybe wants to pick that up?
4464379	4467021	But we need to do actually more stuff that's like...
4468401	4468782	Never forget...
4495605	4511651	when Xbox Live used to discriminate against the word gay being in your profile but they did get rid of that but I remember when I I think we were reporting it here on the show and I was like oh yeah I was really mad about that when that first happened but I kind of forgot that that had happened
4512151	4533502	so we do need a never forget so that like things that I get mad about and you get mad about and Jamie gets mad about we never forget maybe it could be like a page on the wiki and when one of us says never forget this somebody can add it to the wiki so that way we never forget ah yes I like that idea
4538259	4544423	DarkSakura, surely there's something in your mind.
4544463	4545384	You're like, you know what?
4545664	4548446	Never forget that this happened.
4549087	4550868	Never forget that people are bitches.
4552269	4553329	Well, that's just a given.
4553349	4554550	That has nothing to do with gaming.
4555211	4555671	That's all right.
4556021	4556562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4571081	4582967	Here's the thing, I think the Portal 2 thing is still happening, but I think that they're under, you know, they're, oh yeah, the event was cancelled, but, you know, then there's gonna be like, oh, haha, Aperture Science has trapped you all, and now you must run through the maze.
4583107	4585428	Let Jamie get her thought out, and then I've got an idea on that.
4585688	4595953	Well, from what I was reading, though, Half-Life 3 is gonna have, actually, Chell from Portal is supposed to be making her appearance, and then they also are talking about the...
4596893	4601618	Um, what's the name of that ship that Aperture put out that's supposed to show up?
4602518	4604780	Oh, it's Cameo at the end of Portal, isn't it?
4605201	4605481	I think?
4606282	4609625	No, they mentioned it in that retooled Portal.
4610646	4617832	But, um, but like, it's some ship that, of Aperture's that crashed or something.
4618052	4619734	But anyway, I don't remember the whole deal.
4620074	4622676	Okay, here's what I was supposed to say about the Portal 2 party.
4624178	4627841	Is that, I bet what they're doing, like did you hear that really fucked up story?
4627921	4629222	Never forget this, by the way.
4629242	4641653	Did you hear that really fucked up story about that school in like Mississippi or whatever where the girl wanted to go to the prom with her girlfriend but they were like, no, because you're a dirty lesbian and we're not going to have that happen at our prom.
4642113	4643655	And what they did, you know what they ended up doing?
4644195	4647398	They threw another prom in
4647518	4655264	and invited like her and her girlfriend and like eight school misfits to like the fake prom and they had like a real prom somewhere else.
4655284	4656144	Yeah, that was crap.
4656164	4658506	That was fucked up beyond belief, right?
4658966	4660928	What if that's what they're doing with the Portal 2 party?
4663389	4666351	They're like, sorry guys, the Portal 2 party got canceled.
4666932	4669914	I seriously think... But then suddenly we'll see these reports on the internet about...
4670875	4673696	Well, 1up.com got invited to this super secret party.
4673716	4679861	No, I seriously think that they're going to actually have, it's going to be this, you know, oh, it's actually a secret surprise.
4680021	4682142	And then, you know, the surprise is, you know, oh, look at this.
4682783	4689887	You know, the, you know, GLaDOS has hacked the conference or something, you know, something ridiculous like that.
4690968	4693952	Salacious Pop saves the day, DarkSakura.
4694452	4695754	The Borealis is the ship.
4695894	4696435	That was it.
4697816	4700099	I knew it had some sort of celestial name.
4701601	4704705	No, that's like the Aurora Borealis.
4705366	4709651	And Bobby's reminding us that he was supposed to go to the Portal 2 party and he's a misfit now, so...
4710812	4715394	Sorry, Bobby Blackwolf, but it very well could be that you have something in common with a lesbian in Mississippi.
4715414	4716474	Off to the island with you.
4716494	4718275	We'll throw you your improv.
4718295	4719255	That's okay, Bobby.
4719735	4723697	I didn't get invited to anything, so we can have drinks.
4723817	4724477	I take that back.
4725117	4726377	I do have an appointment to see Rock Band 3.
4726658	4726958	Woo!
4727778	4728138	What?
4728318	4729519	So, there's that.
4729779	4730959	Remember, steal a keytar.
4731999	4732480	Okay.
4732960	4733220	Lord.
4733640	4735901	Then you'll really be reading about that on the blogs.
4737116	4738196	Alright, look, let's move on.
4739117	4744599	DarkSakura, we need a dose of something really cool and awesome in this show.
4744619	4745179	How about some class?
4745619	4747880	Alright, this show could use a little class.
4748000	4749420	Actually, this show could use a lot of class.
4749480	4751241	More class than a class action lawsuit.
4751681	4759304	Anyway, first, I must preface this by saying that it is about the recently knighted Sir Patrick Stewart.
4760064	4760224	Woo!
4762150	4762931	That makes me happy.
4762971	4763953	About damn time.
4764033	4766537	So now you must address him as Sir Patrick Stewart.
4766557	4767319	Sir Patrick Stewart.
4767359	4768060	Patrick Stewart.
4770241	4776584	At any rate, he's basically on record saying that he loves his beautiful iPhone.
4777224	4779426	That it has become an extension of himself.
4780166	4782607	That he couldn't imagine going without it or his laptop.
4783147	4785628	But that he has a stack of video games.
4785688	4789290	I want to hear Patrick Stewart narrate a story about how much he loves his iPhone.
4789310	4791011	There's a video on this one too.
4791371	4791651	Really?
4792191	4793972	Talking about it.
4794473	4796974	But he's saying that...
4798988	4801889	He has, in fact, I'll read the quote.
4802209	4808031	The only aspect of all this that I've never taken to, in part because I have an addictive temperament, is gaming.
4808552	4813353	I have a stack of games that I've never taken the covers off of because I feel that if I do, I'm finished.
4814914	4817055	Can I just listen to a little bit of Patrick Stewart?
4817135	4819056	Can I just listen to his voice?
4819076	4820836	Okay, first of all, Rob, you saw Jeffrey, right?
4822057	4823097	Did you see him in Jeffrey?
4823137	4824017	Yeah, years ago.
4824037	4824658	Oh, God, I love it.
4824778	4825678	I love him in that movie.
4825698	4826578	Shh, shh, shh, shh.
4827099	4828179	Everybody, worship.
4829659	4831720	Seems to me to be a little bit simplistic.
4832280	4836523	Maybe I like complexity and abstraction too much.
4838704	4843467	But on the other hand, I just handed someone my
4844636	4852580	Beautiful iPhone, which I never have out of my hand and that I do everything with and has become an extension of who I am.
4853161	4855262	I travel with my laptop everywhere.
4855682	4859064	Emails are absolutely essential in my life.
4860304	4860665	His voice.
4860745	4862666	It sounds like he said sexual in my life.
4862686	4864827	He did say sexual, didn't he?
4865207	4866888	He could just read the phone book to me.
4866928	4869570	Sorry, that was really quiet over the feed.
4869610	4870330	I apologize, guys.
4870370	4871551	I don't know why it's so quiet.
4873772	4874092	Beautiful.
4874517	4875117	I know, right?
4875817	4877058	Sorry, Sir Patrick Stewart.
4877778	4879178	Sir Patrick Stewart.
4879258	4880259	Sir Patrick Stewart.
4880659	4880879	Sir.
4882820	4883360	Haha.
4884120	4885880	All you people who don't like Apple, haha.
4886701	4887961	Alright.
4888261	4890022	Sir Patrick Stewart endorses it.
4890602	4891062	Haha.
4891082	4894663	It's just because he hasn't touched a droid, right, Loki?
4894843	4897524	Not since the days of Star Trek The Next Generation has he ever touched a droid.
4898444	4899785	Loki, how about some release dates?
4899805	4900665	I don't think Data would like that.
4902304	4902844	Release dates.
4902884	4905905	Traveling around the globe talking about what's coming out in a neighborhood near you.
4906565	4906845	Yes.
4907545	4910726	This week, not a lot.
4910746	4914367	There's just some weird stuff and some decent stuff.
4914707	4915907	So let's start with the weird stuff.
4916087	4918808	America's Next Top Model on DS in the Wii.
4918828	4920148	Sorry.
4920848	4921348	Wait a minute.
4921368	4923169	I thought that was supposed to come out like two weeks ago.
4923409	4924409	I'm sorry.
4924649	4927209	As soon as Loki said that, I had to yawn really bad.
4927369	4929610	I remember cracking a Tyra Banks' crazy joke.
4931495	4936118	I understand that, and she is crazy, but it'll come out when it's ready to come out.
4937238	4937878	Just like Tyra.

5134282	5137884	By the way, Loki, one of the big rumblings about what's coming at E3 this year, Saints Row 3...
5138624	5141045	Yeah, but it's not being released until next year, and that makes me sad.
5141446	5150511	Although, seeing how far they went with the Red Faction and the new Red Faction Armageddon game, or I think it's Armageddon is the subtitle on that, it looks awesome.
5150791	5154333	And if that looks awesome, Saints Row 3 is going to be that much more awesome.
5155314	5156414	It's going to be more awesomer.
5156735	5159356	And that should be what's on the title, more awesomer than Saints Row 2.

5294261	5296443	I played that at a classic gaming expo a couple years ago.
5296463	5297083	I remember that, too.
5297424	5298044	It was terrible.
5298744	5299365	Good times.
5301672	5304034	DarkSakura, how about the old country?
5305175	5308237	Well, really not a whole lot.
5309197	5311239	On the 8th is Green Day Rock Band.
5312640	5313600	9th is Joe Danger.

5327182	5327542	The end.
5328623	5329163	It's over!
5329783	5333124	By the way, surprised that no one in studio had anything to say on Super Mario Galaxy 2.
5333885	5338987	My Wii is still not hooked up, that's why I haven't bought the game yet, but I am hearing phenomenal things about the game.
5339707	5343028	So have I, I'm just kind of... I know, it's kind of under the radar right now.
5343068	5347030	It's kind of one of those games I hope I can go back to and play at some point, but for right now it's kind of on the back burner.
5347970	5350691	But yeah, I've heard lots and lots of good things about Mario Galaxy 2.
5351092	5352412	Apparently OutShines the first.
5353192	5353673	In many ways.
5353733	5354613	That'll be impressive.
5355089	5356591	Yeah, the first was not a bad game at all.
5357753	5361898	Perhaps Nintendo can send me a free copy once I pimp out my room in New Super Mario Bros.
5361938	5362018	Eh?
5362399	5362499	Eh?
5362639	5363220	You should try it.
5363240	5363501	Wink?
5363561	5364362	You never know.
5364722	5365804	You know, future gamer!
5367906	5368526	Teaching them young.
5369647	5372268	I'm telling you, when you do that to your kid, your kid's going to rebel.
5372948	5378191	You're going to have a kid that wants to go out and play football all day.
5378371	5379631	I don't care if he wants to go play football.
5379672	5380272	That's fine with me.
5380412	5382373	I'm not forcing him to like video games.
5382433	5384034	That's just the theme we're doing his room in.
5384194	5384894	All right, fair enough.
5384934	5385835	He can do whatever he wants.
5385875	5390917	If he wants to go work on cars and play football and that kind of stuff, that's fine with me.
5390937	5391697	My mom was a painter.
5391717	5392318	He won't, though.
5392998	5393619	How do I need to poo?
5408991	5415215	But my dad, on the other hand, he, see, he bought a ColecoVision for himself and Atari games and stuff.
5415235	5415615	Awesome.
5415675	5417996	And then I just naturally started playing those.
5418056	5420298	They bought me a Texas Instruments computer.
5420758	5422739	That's right, because you were born in like 81, right?
5422999	5423580	When all that was out?
5423660	5423920	No, in 80.
5424240	5423920	80?
5424560	5425020	Okay, 80.
5425100	5425281	Yeah.
5425681	5429763	So, you know, all that stuff came out and just naturally I got into it.
5430043	5434426	And the stuff that I was into, like, when I was that old, you know, I'm into now even more so.
5434446	5434546	It's...
5438308	5438728	I don't know.
5438908	5440849	I'm not going to force it upon you.
5440989	5443530	You have to play games because my wife hates games.
5444191	5447692	Which is ironic that she suggested that we do a Mario Brothers themed room.
5448372	5449133	Never would have thought that.
5449413	5451054	I know.
5451094	5453815	Your wife does have those random moments of gaming.
5454475	5455176	and DarkSakura.com.
5481536	5483497	They only have so much ground.
5483597	5486759	It's like four feet worth of the ground vinyl.
5487420	5489741	And we just can't circle the room with that stuff.
5489802	5490922	So we have to paint everything.
5491002	5494825	I mean, I'm not going to spend money to buy enough sheets to cover the whole room.
5494885	5495846	It'd be ridiculous.
5496266	5498868	Why are all the guests leaving the funny comments tonight?
5498928	5502070	Guest 5872, please change your name, folks.
5502090	5504692	When you get in there, type slash Nick and then the new name.
5504712	5505773	And I congratulate you appropriately.
5506193	5507154	Or you get booted.
5507414	5508855	Suki-ban-sa-chu-re-na.
5508875	5509055	Yeah.
5509555	5511775	You should do this room in President Cat.
5513316	5514736	Clearly it's a listener of the show.
5514916	5517176	We almost did it in Stella themed.
5517236	5518477	Stella would be my cat.
5520217	5521277	But that would be weird.
5521357	5521957	Kitty themed.
5521997	5524138	She is a little bitch.
5526198	5532259	She wants me to play, because we made her a toy out of bag handles.
5532579	5535760	They're these little string handles or whatever, and we tied them together.
5536040	5536600	And now she'll go...
5537520	5538943	She locked her in a room with Shermie
5547373	5547733	Alright.
5548394	5549815	We gotta move on, guys.
5549835	5552157	We're an hour and a half into Part A and we're not even done yet.
5552197	5554118	But we haven't talked about my cat enough yet!
5554278	5554598	I'm sorry.
5554839	5556079	I really want a cat, y'all.
5556580	5557721	I'm getting to that point.
5557921	5560543	I think it's time for me to be a daddy.
5561703	5562444	Rob needs to be a daddy.
5562464	5563425	Rob, you're in luck.
5563765	5565246	Because I have a cat for you.
5566047	5567328	No, I don't want your cat.
5567428	5568208	No, not my cat.
5568268	5568649	Screw that.
5568689	5569149	My cat's
5570149	5573030	I'm talking about Barney, the female cat outside.
5574970	5584552	She's still a wild cat, and yeah, I don't know why we call her Barney, but that's the name we gave her before we found out that she was a girl, and so it just stuck.
5584812	5591593	But she actually is very friendly and comes up to us and stuff, so I will trap her for you if you want.
5592593	5593173	Oh, great.
5593793	5595474	I brought you a kitty in a box.
5595894	5596834	Adopt a cat, Rob.
5597034	5599555	Yeah, I'm not going to do it just yet.
5600475	5601935	They're so easy to take care of, though.
5601995	5604936	I know, but remember, I'm gone every weekend, you guys.
5605196	5605896	Every weekend I'm gone.
5605916	5607757	So I'll go take care of your cat on the weekends.
5607897	5608677	No, you won't.
5608717	5609637	It's too far.
5610318	5612658	No, I go take care of Susan's cat when she goes out of town.
5612718	5613038	Really?
5613458	5613778	We'll see.
5613818	5614539	We'll see, guys.
5614699	5616839	Rob, I would take care of your pussy.
5618720	5620320	Would you pet my pussy when it needed it?
5620440	5620980	Yes, I would.
5621080	5621701	Oh, thank you.
5622301	5623281	And give it a bath.
5625603	5626724	Hi, I've watched Shermie.
5626885	5628486	Would you wash my pussy on the weekend?
5630488	5631429	Well, I've got a schedule.
5632511	5635634	Never forget how mature we are here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5636115	5637736	Alright, a couple quick stories for you.
5637776	5638818	Classic Game of the Week coming up.
5639058	5640099	Loki, what do you got for us?
5640737	5648865	Yes, so we were talking a little bit about Project $10 and how EA likes to find ways to milk you for your precious money.
5649265	5656713	Well, now they're doing it again, and this isn't something that you necessarily have to do, but it's something you may be tempted to do.
5657273	5662475	Madden 11 basically logs everything that you do online.
5662955	5667416	Your play calling, what tendencies you do, and that kind of stuff.
5667456	5669136	And it builds kind of a playbook.
5669156	5669497	Wait, wait, wait.
5669557	5670897	It can't see your porn collection, can it?
5671417	5671657	No.
5672297	5673518	It can't see your porn collection.
5674218	5680960	And it basically builds like a playbook that kind of revolves around what you do.
5681800	5700289	and um now during if you you know play i guess enough people or whatever uh other people can get that from you but um you can actually purchase um these reports as well so that you can kind of get the dirt on the other players that you're playing against
5702672	5724662	and um that's kind of strange like I don't really have another word for that that's just I don't know I mean well yeah you of course sell it take all that information and then sell it it's kind of shady but it's kind of like them selling the cheats that were in the games you know you cheats that used to be just button presses now you have to pay two dollars to unlock and type stuff
5725682	5729766	It's just... It's such a desperate money grab.
5729806	5731848	I mean, seriously.
5732469	5734751	You're becoming that desperate chick, EA.
5735491	5736712	Nobody likes desperate chick.
5736893	5738514	Anything they can do, right?
5738994	5740916	Any place they can get more money.
5740956	5741597	Stop being so...
5741917	5742377	I don't know.
5742397	5744219	I mean, it's just there's no real benefit if you don't do it, I guess.
5744239	5744859	You know what I mean?
5744920	5749203	If you're going to charge me for online for used or whatever than the real game.
5749243	5749643	I don't know.
5772741	5775722	But I guess if you buy it, you knew it really doesn't affect you anyways.
5776262	5777822	But seriously, though, don't let it slide.
5777902	5778423	Never forget.
5780863	5781123	All right.
5781923	5784244	This is going to make you even more angry, you guys.
5784604	5787225	Apparently, there is a draft.
5787845	5788925	It's not a law yet.
5788945	5792346	This is just a draft that the Federal Trade Commission here in the U.S.
5792446	5793226	making this draft.
5794286	5800948	They're making some proposals to Washington, and apparently one of them is a 5% tax on consumer electronics.
5802031	5806454	Now, some folks are calling this the iPad tax, but it's not just iPads, you guys.
5806614	5808116	It really should be just iPads, though.
5808256	5816562	iPhones, iMacs, Zunes, DSs, 360s, laptops, digital cameras.
5816582	5820184	I mean, basically Best Buy is fucked.
5820244	5823367	A lot of things you buy there are going to have a 5% tax on it.
5823387	5824908	They're just going to pass it on to the consumer.
5825228	5826370	Why are they doing this, folks?
5826610	5826910	Why?
5827351	5836003	Because it will generate $4 billion for the US government, which it could then use to subsidize failing media outlets like newspapers.
5839361	5840643	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5856681	5857381	Not that long ago.
5857421	5872124	I remember reading, and maybe it wasn't on this show, but about how the iPad is reinvigorating the old school media because a lot of these newspapers are coming out with editions for the iPad that they're selling subscriptions to, and they're actually doing quite well.
5872184	5873964	And magazines are doing this too.
5874164	5876265	The iPad is becoming this new reading device.
5876745	5882766	It's kind of like, why do we need to save your archaic ass if you're not going to evolve?
5884707	5885687	It just doesn't make sense.
5886427	5890229	Again, it hasn't passed yet, but it's a dumb idea.
5891949	5893850	I just don't like what they're using the money for.
5893890	5896330	I think the money could go to the more important things.
5896670	5898631	Why do we have to bail out the news media?
5898971	5900631	I mean, they sell ads.
5900972	5905093	They need to evolve and adopt to where their readers are.
5905113	5906813	Can I get some of that money?
5906953	5907593	We're media.
5910134	5911074	We're floundering.
5911114	5913355	We haven't made a dime since this show began.
5915703	5917044	I want four billion dollars.
5917964	5919364	It's just, it's stupid.
5920145	5921445	Stop bailing out companies.
5922846	5923206	Seriously.
5924246	5929008	Alright, well let's move on to a part of the show that needs no bailing out.
5929048	5931249	It's very popular here on the Orange Lounge Radio.
5931629	5933869	And every week you guys come to know and love this segment.
5934250	5936931	It is the classic game of the week.
5938451	5938871	Rob?
5939271	5939491	Yes.
5939852	5943733	I think that everyone's going to figure out what this game is when you play the opening sequence.
5944312	5961439	Alright, so then, well, let me just say though, every week, for those that maybe have never listened to Orange House Radio before, every week, DarkSakura likes to go through the vault, the classic video game vault, and pick out a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful little bastards playing on the lawn, you need to go play this classic video game immediately.
5961459	5962899	Get off my lawn and play this game.
5963180	5963780	Exactly.
5965000	5967481	Maybe that's what we should rename the segment, get off my lawn and play this game.
5968042	5971483	Here is tonight's classic game of the week.
5981553	5982755	Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear Solid
5995351	5997232	and who said Barbie?
5997752	5998152	Whatever.
5999173	5999513	Anyway.
6000613	6011117	Metal Gear Solid, a stealth action game that was directed and written by the guy I used to run into every year at E3, Hideo Kojima.
6012758	6023662	It first came out in 1998 for the PlayStation and it's actually the sequel to the MSX2 Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake.
6024042	6025444	Not the one that we got over here.
6025905	6028388	The actual MSX version.
6028608	6030711	Wait, what in the actual hell is this video?
6030751	6033034	It's actually 3 hours and 20 minutes long.
6033074	6034495	Like, people can do this on YouTube now?
6034535	6035897	That's the playthrough of the first half of the game.
6035917	6037539	I thought you were limited to 10 minutes.
6037659	6038060	In theory.
6038080	6038180	What?
6042646	6044367	I love the voice acting in this.
6044667	6050293	And by the way, the guy who did Snake's voice was David Hayter and he also wrote the first two X-Men movies.
6050333	6051294	Which is why they were good.
6052615	6053576	And the third one blew.
6054037	6055939	He had written the third one and it would have been good.
6056479	6056739	Anyway.
6057840	6059302	Both are being held as hostages.
6059782	6066588	So this is the one that brought Metal Gear up to the current generation of gamers.
6066628	6082421	Basically he's going in and stopping a group called Foxhound, which was his old unit, has to liberate some hostages and basically stop them from...
6084395	6085957	Well, blowing up the earth, I guess.
6087979	6089841	Man, I hate it when people try to blow up the earth.
6089861	6092605	Let's play Thermonuclear War.
6093746	6097350	So yeah, it has amazing voice acting.
6098071	6102756	And even with the limitations of the visuals back in the day,
6103317	6114081	They really did a good job in covering up the things that would have been harder to show, like blurring the face a little bit, smoothing the line here or there.
6114141	6116221	It really did look very good for its day.
6117162	6126565	You could get all kinds of bonus stuff to use in the game, because it's on-site weapons procurement, as well as being played like the old ones.
6127365	6135150	Um, you can also get infrared goggles and a cardboard box and he smuggles his cigarettes in through his stomach.
6136491	6139033	Does it mean that he barfs up his cigarettes as soon as he lands?
6139373	6140194	Perhaps, I don't know.
6141495	6144697	Actually, you have to use the cigarettes to get through a couple of stages, too.
6144817	6147139	I think it's funny.
6147259	6154944	There are, as you can tell from listening to all the speaking in the background, lots of cutscenes and conversations.
6155004	6156946	This game is very dialogue heavy.
6158967	6162409	But on the plus side, it's very good voice acting.
6162429	6164471	Rob, why don't you turn it up a little bit?
6166032	6167573	Unfortunately, it's a little bit quiet, but here you go.
6170310	6173611	Oh, that's when he's about to land, so... There's no voice acting right now.
6173631	6174571	There's some in a second.
6176112	6177992	We're at the part where he breaks through the water.
6179132	6181753	And that's the start menu of the game.
6183814	6187055	Well, we can do it.
6187215	6188355	I love the music in this game.
6188375	6189275	I actually have the soundtrack.
6189295	6190996	I have the soundtrack to all the Metal Gear Solid games.
6192456	6195037	And I also pick up all the art books for Dan every year.
6196757	6197277	At any rate...
6199778	6204903	The whole first part of the game is to teach you the whole stealth part of the game.
6205443	6210147	Once you get the stealth down, you can actually go through the whole game for the most part without killing people.
6211328	6213991	You get bonuses, I think, for the fewer that you kill.
6215712	6226315	but you also have to sort of maintain a working knowledge of how the entire facility is laid out as you go through it because you have to run back through it part of the way.
6227255	6240278	The characters you have in this one is, I think this is funny, the character designer said that Solid State's physique was based off of Jean-Claude Van Damme but his face was based off of Christopher Walken.
6241917	6242558	I don't see that.
6242998	6245240	I think he's a little bit better looking than Christopher Walken.
6248162	6261514	So you've got Roy Campbell, who is his former CO, and then you have Master Miller, and Mei Ling, and Naomi Hunter, and Natasha Romanenko, who is a weapons person.
6261534	6267399	But you also get Otacon, who is named after the convention.
6267479	6268280	Here's some voice acting.
6268700	6269040	There you go.
6269060	6273743	That's the other thing I was gonna bring up is that this game totally breaks the fourth wall, like, all the time.
6297249	6308261	First of all, when you run into one of the other hostages, he tells you about a soldier that Snake ran into earlier who ends up being Meryl.
6309022	6311725	He said, yeah, you can contact her on Kodak.
6312006	6315189	Oh, I remember, her number is on the back of the CD case.
6316531	6316771	Nice.
6317344	6317784	Psycho Mantis
6347644	6349506	You better hide somewhere.
6373588	6389813	Um, so yeah, you go through the game, you get to see Metal Gear Rex, and, um, oh yeah, you also have, um, a, uh, an informant called Deep Throat, which I thought was a kind of neat nod towards, um, well, you know, there was an actual Deep Throat.
6389833	6390554	Towards Linda Lovelace?
6390854	6391814	Oh, oh, sorry, no.
6392034	6394336	The actual, yeah, no, I know Watergate, of course I know Watergate.
6394356	6396257	And he finally, finally came forward.
6396337	6397898	Oh yeah, that's right, like right before he died, right?
6397978	6398179	Yeah.
6398919	6400660	You know, I think he was declassified at the time.
6401681	6408086	So, man, that's something else though, being able to hold a secret that long, you know?
6410208	6420342	Anyway, you go through the game, you have an epic battle with Liquid Snake, who is the antagonist and Solid Snake's twin.
6421223	6425869	And you also have two endings based on what you do during the torture sequence.
6426730	6428512	One of them, Meryl gets to live.
6429634	6430775	The other one, Meryl dies.
6431856	6431996	Aww.
6433078	6435380	And there's my favorite question in the whole game.
6436041	6438384	Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on the battlefield?
6442228	6445652	Why does love always feel like a battlefield?
6445692	6446673	Battlefield.
6447274	6448194	Battlefield.
6448535	6452179	Also, for tie-ins, and I know I've brought up Policenauts before.
6455222	6458846	Meryl was a character in Policenauts.
6459486	6460827	So she was included.
6463808	6470551	And then there's references to Metal Gear in Policenauts.
6471191	6479075	And actually, I think scenes from Policenauts that go through when Otacon is talking about being a big geek.
6480215	6481396	Basically, he's a big otaku.
6483056	6483837	He pees himself, too.
6485171	6489175	The first time you meet him, seriously, he backs into a corner and pisses himself.
6490016	6490997	Hello LP joke.
6491377	6493139	I know, right?
6496422	6504671	And there's also preliminary artwork that was an Easter egg for Policenaut's pilot disc for the 3DO, which I think didn't come out, actually.
6505736	6509638	So yeah, there were some side stories.
6509678	6524625	There was Metal Gear Solid Integral, which is based off of the expanded Japanese version, except it had a VR mode with it.
6525185	6527586	We got the VR missions as a separate disc.
6528406	6532408	But it had like a PS, you remember the Pocket Station, Rob?
6534196	6535997	It had a Pocket Station minigame.
6537778	6543240	You could call the codec frequency and get commentary from the staff.
6543401	6547863	And you had a first-person game mode.
6548963	6554085	And then there was also Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes, which came out on GameCube.
6554105	6555426	How's that sneaking suit working out?
6555866	6561327	And also one that people may not be familiar with, the BLEEM version for BLEEMcast.
6562547	6567749	Which basically, it ran it through with the Dreamcast's superior rendering capabilities, and it was really nice.
6567989	6568629	I've got it.
6569669	6577651	I mean, I totally suggest everyone look up BLEEM for Dreamcast, Metal Gear Solid, and then compare them side by side.
6577731	6578511	It really is night and day.
6581153	6582455	The soundtrack was amazing.
6582695	6584778	It was done by Rika Muranaka.
6589584	6598327	Well, actually, the ending song was done by her, and it's also sung in Irish for the ending.
6599027	6601548	I thought it was funny.
6601708	6604369	So yeah, from there we got all kinds of others.
6604389	6610710	We got digital comics, we got a graphic novel, and then, of course, there were all of the sequels.
6611251	6614372	Metal Gear Solitude, The Avengers of Raiden running around naked.
6615472	6615552	Pfft.
6619150	6620231	Did you ever play that one, Rob?
6621671	6621991	Which one?
6622352	6623052	The second one.
6623852	6625273	A very little, very, very little.
6625613	6628815	It was Metal Gear, it was Sons of Liberty.
6630537	6633119	Snake is in there calling himself Iroquois Plissken.
6634520	6637583	You know, Plissken also from Snake Plissken.
6638704	6645449	And then Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, where he's actually playing as Naked Snake, who turns out to be Big Boss.
6646109	6646670	Spoiler!
6647170	6648171	Ooh, where have you been?
6649092	6652254	And then Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots.
6653695	6653995	What's wrong?
6654015	6654215	Nothing.
6654255	6657677	I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so... cute.
6677341	6678524	You're just flattering me.
6678885	6679788	No, I'm serious.
6680690	6683016	Well, I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
6683498	6683979	Come on.
6685009	6687891	I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake.
6688772	6690213	But I'm surprised.
6690653	6690953	Yeah.
6691354	6698959	Anyway, if you keep talking to her, she'll give you like a little parable or a little phrase.
6699400	6701221	She's basically your fortune cookie throughout the game.
6701701	6704363	But if you keep calling her, she'll eventually just get mad at you.
6704984	6706625	And her answer will be dot, dot, dot.
6706645	6707866	And she'll have this big frowny face.
6709665	6715472	And then there's another... I think it was in the second one?
6715492	6724902	Or was it in the first one where you're in the locker and if you look at the picture of the girl and then call someone on the codec, it sounds like he's jerking off.
6725122	6725202	Yeah.
6727245	6727725	Okay.
6728386	6730327	There's Easter eggs in this game.
6730547	6733830	It's like Otacon tells him, we don't have time for that snake.
6734210	6735371	That was the second one.
6735391	6738013	He's like, we don't have time for that snake.
6738954	6740135	And he's just got the O face.
6740635	6741236	It's funny.
6741876	6742997	So yeah.
6743138	6743258	Ew.
6743278	6745379	I think I know a little bit too much about the Metal Gear games.
6745499	6746000	You sure do.
6746620	6747301	Alright, but that's alright.
6747401	6749703	So is that it for the wrap up?
6749723	6750003	That's it.
6750043	6750243	Alright.
6751360	6752423	We gotta move on with the show.
6753707	6756155	That was an epic game of the week there.
6756336	6756597	Epic.
6756898	6758322	I'm already losing my voice again.
6758880	6762783	Metal Gear Solid is your classic game of the week, and a true classic at that.
6763263	6766606	Alright, we are going to take a quick break so that we can rest our voices and all that fun stuff.
6766666	6767186	We will be back.
6767206	6768547	We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to go.
6768787	6770168	It's going to be a long episode tonight, you guys.
6770389	6775773	We're going to talk about a new game from the creator of Parappa the Rappa, possible upgrades of old PS2 titles.
6775893	6777514	Goldeneye could be making a comeback.
6777534	6780336	We're going to talk all about that in Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
6780356	6781237	Don't go anywhere, folks.
6781297	6784319	We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6790199	6796974	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, June the 6th of 2010 where we are doing episode number 369 of our show.
6800750	6802051	E3 is just around the corner.
6802111	6805434	Of course, we've had a lot of news and rumors and stuff about what's coming up at E3.
6805974	6811518	Also, I think our show is taping live tonight while the MTV Movie Awards are going on, I think is the big thing tonight.
6812659	6815160	And as to who's winning right now, I don't care.
6815901	6817042	I mean, are those awards relevant?
6817062	6817982	Do they actually mean anything?
6818062	6821985	Or is it just an excuse to get a bunch of celebrities together for ratings?
6822886	6823426	Yeah.
6824267	6824527	Yeah.
6825137	6826438	Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel too.
6826858	6839364	All right, so let's get back into some gaming news then, some things we care about around here, and some rapid, quick stories for you guys here before we get back to some Twitter topics, which we're going to get to in a moment, at twitter.com slash OLR.
6839424	6842145	So you've probably got like three minutes to get in your topics if you haven't yet.
6842685	6845607	In the meantime, let's do some rapid fire news.
6846047	6852093	Well, the first of hopefully many pieces of download content for Red Dead Redemption will be coming out soon.
6852894	6859380	On June 22nd, Outlaws to the End will be adding some new content to the game.
6859841	6864285	Six online co-op missions for two to four players.
6865006	6869550	And also, they're going to have some different...
6871960	6873801	I don't know, different types of missions in there.
6873821	6876643	It looks like one where you're escorting a raft, which is kind of cool.
6877584	6889032	And that would be great because I don't know about people that have played Red Dead Redemption, but the gang hideouts that you can actually play during free mode, I think we've gone through all of those at least six times now.
6889313	6894056	It's getting old fast, and we need some more things to play.
6894617	6896378	So that would be awesome.
6897719	6901803	and of course that is going to be free on the 22nd.
6904045	6917018	We Party is going to be one of the games that are going to be shown off this year at Nintendo's press conference and it's going to feature 80 plus games including some interesting ones.
6917418	6919020	Remote Control Hide and Seek
6920322	6921063	That's kind of cool.
6921423	6929837	I guess the players will hide their Wii remotes somewhere in the room and the other players have to search for it by the sound coming from the controller's speaker.
6930498	6930919	Wow.
6933154	6950167	groundbreaking and revolutionary I will give them props for being somewhat unique some of the other games they were talking about called 1-1 Karuta wouldn't it be funny if like you hit the thing too good and then it's too far away from the Wii to make a noise or whatever so it gets lost forever
6950347	6951007	That would be funny.
6951107	6952908	Sucker, gotta buy another $40 controller.
6953588	6963031	Wanwan Karuta is a game where the Wii Remote will make a sound and the players will have to match the noise with an on-screen image, for example an animal.
6963932	6974475	They also have a game called Sensitive Bomb which players will pass the single remote to one another without trying to jostle it too much to trigger the explosion.
6975376	6977916	So what you do is you pass it to another player and then you push them.
6978537	6979077	Ha ha ha ha!
6980738	6983160	That's playing with power.
6984821	6988763	And that'll be, of course, shown at the press conference on June 15th.
6990324	6991485	Some other fun stuff.
6991585	6995827	Will Reggie Fils-Aimé come out and try to blow somebody up and push them and all that stuff, you think?
6996007	7001530	He won't because he's probably endorsing family play that's not destructive like that.
7002411	7003231	I don't give a shit.
7004912	7006373	There are no rules in Wii Parking.
7008054	7013338	Um, K'nex is apparently teaming up with Nintendo to make some Mario Kart toys.
7014198	7017521	And this is supposed to be happening sometime in 2011.
7018761	7026447	But that is awesome that you can make toys based on Mario Kart and K'nex because, you know, hey, if it's not Lego, it's K'nex.
7026787	7029889	So that would be, uh, be fun.
7031510	7035793	I would love to have like Lego or K'nex toys based on like the Mario stuff.
7037978	7042862	So, um, Salacious Pop is keeping us updated in chat on the MTV Movie Awards.
7043262	7044864	Here's why you're glad you're not watching.
7044884	7045504	You ready for this?
7046004	7049667	Best female performance, Kristen Stewart in Twilight, New Moon.
7050368	7053971	Best male performance, Robert Pattinson in Twilight, New Moon.
7054071	7055412	We're clearly not the demographic.
7055432	7057994	Best movie, The Twilight Saga, New Moon.
7059454	7062856	We are not the demographic for MTV anymore.
7062896	7063917	You have to understand.
7063997	7068359	It's just the MTV we knew and loved is gone.
7069300	7069720	It's dead.
7069880	7070941	You know what Twilight needs?
7071901	7072682	Simon Belmont.
7072722	7073682	That's what Twilight needs.
7075615	7079780	Hey, going on to some quick fire news and some other stuff that's coming out.
7080241	7082003	Rock Band Weekly updates.
7082484	7083865	Deftones are coming out.
7083905	7084606	Whoop-dee-doo.
7084807	7087250	Grown up in Sacramento, I've heard way too much Deftones.
7088011	7089793	Cherry Waves, Hole in the Earth, and Minerva.
7089893	7090454	Whoop-dee-whoop-dee.
7091255	7113256	individual songs Boys Like Girls with The Great Escape and Crown of Thorns with Rock Ready I will be buying none of those songs but maybe you're interested I too will be buying none of those songs here's a game that might actually catch my interest maybe I will buy this it's a game called Hardcore Uprising Hard Corps but I think the P is silent when you say it like that Hardcore Uprising
7114096	7116697	for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.
7116717	7118038	And why am I interested in this game?
7118078	7121039	Apparently it's a spiritual successor to Contra.
7121539	7122720	It plays like Contra.
7122840	7123960	It feels like Contra.
7124040	7124780	It's high def.
7124881	7125721	It's side-scroller.
7125821	7126501	It's guns.
7127001	7129402	It just doesn't have Contra in it.
7129622	7134244	But the game looks awesome because it's done by Axis, I think.
7134364	7135425	Or not Axis...
7137985	7139526	The people that did it are like, please blue.
7139606	7140886	Because it's all hand-drawn stuff.
7140906	7141586	It looks awesome.
7141606	7145107	Well, you might remember there was a Genesis game called Contra Hard Corps.
7145347	7147447	This is apparently a successor to that game.
7147507	7150488	But for whatever reason, they've just decided not to call it Contra.
7150548	7154269	I guess they just didn't want people to know what this game was.
7154449	7155629	So, whatever.
7156689	7157309	It still looks cool.
7158129	7158609	There it is.
7160090	7160450	Let's see.
7161775	7163317	Yeah, Arc System Works, apparently.
7163337	7165060	Yes, Arc System Works, that's what I was thinking.
7165741	7169346	So it will be beautifully animated, that's for sure.
7172082	7172362	All right.
7172842	7176003	Also coming out, Earthworm Jim HD.
7176063	7177904	Apparently that is the big release next week.
7178624	7180204	Also some deals.
7180624	7182185	Worms 2 is getting a price reduction.
7182245	7184065	Peggle goes down to 400 points.
7184485	7186266	Duke Nukem 3D is down to 400 points.
7186326	7187966	I'm going to have to finally pick that up.
7188346	7190367	So, yeah, lots of good deals on Xbox Live next week.
7190427	7193848	And, of course, Earthworm Jim, or as the intro says, Earthworm Jim.
7194008	7194908	You know, a little burping thing.
7195608	7197989	HD comes out on this Wednesday, June the 9th.
7198149	7201474	and that's going to be awesome because you can play four person co-op.
7201555	7202116	That's right.
7202496	7202997	That'll be fun.
7204119	7204619	So there it is.
7204800	7209407	A couple stories about things coming out very soon on the downloadable platforms.
7210048	7210489	DarkSakura.
7211098	7238594	and other news Sony Online Entertainment has actually released some information about PlayStation 3 and PC MMO for DC Universe Online but they really haven't said too much more about it there's no real release date but they said that both versions will come out at the same time it's likely to be in November which actually is what they finally came out and said
7241276	7243116	So that's cool, I guess.
7243536	7246438	I don't know how it'll play, but hey.
7247498	7261963	Also, the voice actor Phil Snyder, who we better know as the voice of Jiminy Cricket, is working on an unannounced project called Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
7263084	7267626	And so that... But that's...
7270012	7292010	Likely a sequel to the mobile game, the mobile phone game, Kingdom Hearts Coded Could be a redrawn, you know, an upscaled version or ported too Could be You know, when you're going from mobile phone to PSP, you expect things are going to be upgraded quite a bit Not really I would hope so Could be an iPhone title
7293354	7294435	Oh, that could be too.
7294455	7295896	I don't know how I feel about that.
7296596	7309583	And then we've had some more Sims titles, domains actually being registered by corporate domains.
7311264	7312145	There are...
7314466	7331384	The Sims Medieval or The Sims Get Medieval so could possibly be old school jousting sims with chamber pots and chastity belts and tight lacing and
7332084	7335447	What if they have it where you can design your castles and stuff like that?
7336908	7341871	Well, not that you can't design castles and add motes, because hell, I was doing that in Sims 1.
7342571	7344193	Well, the motes part.
7344213	7348415	They've actually got out a Ren Faire set officially through the Sims store.
7348856	7356421	And then Mod the Sims, which is one of the mod sites I go through, they actually did a medieval challenge.
7357990	7358350	Outro Outro Outro
7383982	7385803	Yes, I've seen that movie.
7386143	7386523	1987 called.
7386744	7387084	A lot.
7387164	7387864	It misses you.
7388545	7389705	Hey, I got it right.
7392187	7392567	All right.
7393587	7394268	Never forget.
7394288	7396089	And I am the Duke of Ted.
7396229	7397009	Never forget.
7397470	7399671	DarkSakura is a freaking nerd.
7399951	7400231	So?
7401632	7402192	Nerd.
7402212	7403053	And that's why we love you.
7403153	7403893	You nerd.
7404493	7404814	So?
7405274	7405614	All right.
7406034	7408156	So, you're just a nerdy nerd.
7408176	7408536	That's all.
7410242	7414503	All right, we're going to get into a segment here on the show we like to call the Twitter Topics.
7415524	7417344	But I'm missing the theme music for Twitter Topics.
7417484	7419085	Can we do Twitter Topics with no theme music?
7420045	7420525	Can we?
7420825	7421205	I don't know.
7422726	7423046	I don't know.
7423086	7424186	Do we have like music?
7424486	7426347	Are you going to sing the theme music?
7426927	7427227	All right.
7427507	7428367	Well, you're saved anyway.
7428408	7428828	I found it.
7430228	7432609	We call stretching for time while I look for stuff for Twitter Topics.
7433049	7434569	Not a lot of tweets tonight.
7434869	7438110	I'm frowning with disappointment at our listeners.
7438230	7439671	Here's my frown to all of you.
7441803	7442838	Alright, uh...
7445228	7448870	Let's see, lots of plugs for articles on the website.
7448911	7450011	See, I got those in earlier.
7450412	7453694	Dr. Noir sent his condolences to the Golden Girl loving crew.
7454034	7458317	Yeah, I guess we didn't really talk about this enough earlier in the show, but there was a lot of celebrity death, obviously.
7458777	7461659	I don't buy the whole death comes in threes things.
7461739	7464301	I think people just look for coincidences wherever they want to.
7465522	7469925	Because didn't, like, Art Link let her die, too, and nobody cares about him, though, so whatever.
7470085	7471025	Well, I'm saying, you know.
7471065	7471906	And Gary Coleman.
7472486	7474908	Right, who technically does have a video game tie-in.
7475509	7477535	He was in Portal 2, er, it's Portal 2.
7479116	7480016	Postal 2.
7480356	7481197	Much different.
7481737	7483297	He still could be in Portal 2.
7483677	7489619	More importantly, he's in Avenue Q. Drew McClanahan, of course.
7490239	7490859	No, no, no, no.
7490919	7491519	The man.
7492540	7493920	Our zombie man, Dennis Hopper.
7495280	7499822	I put on my Facebook that Dennis Hopper was going to come back as a zombie riding a motorcycle.
7499842	7502042	Wasn't he an easy rider?
7502182	7502642	He wrote it.
7503923	7504463	That's what I mean.
7504483	7508204	That was his big movie in all the Romero flicks.
7508705	7513246	But I think my uncle added on there that Gary Coleman would be in the sidecar.
7514781	7516902	Predator used Call of Duty to coerce kids into sending nude pics.
7544505	7559508	A New Jersey man convinced four 13 and 14-year-olds to send him pictures of their genitals by saying that it was a membership condition of the clan he was starting in Call of Duty World of War.
7560228	7566170	Jonathan Prime is 20 years old and faces four felony counts of communication with a minor for immoral purposes.
7566890	7572571	He also has a previous conviction on a child porn charge related to this case in his home state.
7574619	7578881	He's in jail on a $25,000 bond and all this stuff.
7580321	7586104	Kids, don't send pictures of your penis over Xbox Live ever.
7586384	7589625	You shouldn't really send pictures of your penis anywhere.
7590265	7591266	And let me tell you why.
7592346	7593166	It gets bigger.
7595927	7598488	Until when do you stop growing like 23 or something?
7598548	7600949	I mean, just wait.
7601069	7602490	Wait until you're fully matured.
7604008	7605029	And it's gross.
7605169	7605690	Come on.
7605730	7606811	That's the real reason.
7606851	7607791	You don't do that.
7608432	7611575	Don't send pictures of your dongle over the internet.
7612195	7612496	All right.
7614357	7614778	Let's see.
7615198	7618841	Meow Frog sent us some tweets saying, First time listening to OLR Live.
7618861	7619502	Well, welcome.
7619822	7622064	And what's the chat for OLR?
7622084	7624927	Well, I saw Meow Frog in chat earlier, so I know they made it to chat.
7624947	7630932	But it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com for anyone else who is listening and wanting to know how to join us in our chat room.
7631492	7637617	Um, although if you ask in the all games chat, um, they'll probably tell you how to get over there too.
7639258	7639558	All right.
7640779	7641479	Um, let's see.
7642560	7643501	Uh, what else do we have?
7643521	7644561	That's, that's about it.
7644742	7647303	Uh, except Jay, I hope I'm saying this right.
7647323	7647804	Jay Jugo.
7647824	7650005	Uh, I hope it's not Hugo.
7650406	7654168	Jay Jugo says, uh, the never forget segment should be added to the show.
7654328	7655049	Never forget.
7655309	7657891	I'm just not sure how to make that like a piece of the show.
7661069	7665237	Loomis sends us a tweet saying, OLR, will you be going to BlizzCon Sky?
7665357	7666620	I would love to buy you a drink.
7666740	7667201	No homo.
7669767	7672989	DarkSakura and I are, we're thinking about just going down to Anaheim anyway, if finances will allow.
7673169	7675310	We'll go down to Anaheim anyway and just go to Disneyland.
7697766	7699268	It'll be called UsCon.
7699608	7699848	Yes.
7700489	7703031	So you can buy us a drink there, I suppose.
7703111	7703511	No homo.
7706935	7707515	By the way, Rob.
7707615	7707795	What?
7708716	7712780	I had to describe to somebody what the difference between girly and gay was.
7713621	7714381	Oh my gosh.
7714401	7715062	In decorating.
7717914	7720977	I don't, I just cannot even possibly understand.
7721458	7721718	All right.
7722298	7722679	That's it.
7722719	7723399	That's it for tweets.
7724280	7725261	We didn't get a lot of tweets tonight.
7725281	7727022	Well, we got, I mean, TigerClaw sent us other stories.
7727043	7728184	There are things that are coming up later.
7728264	7733688	So, you know, we appreciate his Google foo, but I don't want to spoil upcoming stories.
7735356	7738497	Alright, how about some other topics we want to talk about tonight?
7738557	7738937	Loki!
7739717	7749099	Yes, let's talk about how Parappa the Rapper, well, the creator of Parappa the Rapper, is putting out a new music game for the iPhone and iPod.
7750639	7751979	It looks interesting, I guess.
7752319	7758661	It's called, looks like Winta, or War is Not the Answer.
7759761	7760221	And it's...
7762748	7763188	War.
7763689	7764069	Huh.
7764469	7765370	What is it good for?
7767491	7767792	Butter.
7768592	7772115	Uh, yeah.
7774036	7781902	They didn't really say what exactly the game is going to be like, but it's basically tapping squares on a screen to time with music.
7782502	7789627	So, kind of looks a little bit like it could be similar to Elite Beat Agents or something like that.
7789687	7791769	Is the art done by Mr. Greenblatt?
7792432	7793813	Thanks for watching!
7809098	7809758	Come on.
7809819	7814300	How about a new, like, actual, like, Parappa or Umjama Lamy type game?
7814340	7821483	I mean, tell me that, like, Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, I suppose, more appropriately, would not be, like, the perfect platform for a game like that.
7821583	7822304	Come on.
7822564	7823144	Yeah, it would be cool.
7823164	7824704	It'd be awesome.
7825785	7826525	You gotta believe.
7827005	7827646	Never gonna happen.
7827686	7830547	By the way, the butter, you know where that comes from?
7831107	7832448	Is that from... Cheap Cheap's level?
7833628	7837830	We used to just... For months, Dan and I would go around going, crack, crack, butter!
7839030	7840791	So he laughed in the other room.
7842372	7842952	I feel happy.
7844193	7849035	And Derek H. took my question literally, saying war saved us from the Nazis and war freed the slaves.
7849655	7850635	I was singing a song.
7850795	7852396	I don't... Forget it.
7852676	7853136	It's alright.
7854737	7855417	Alright, moving on.
7858308	7863911	Could Sony possibly be planning more PS2 remakes?
7864591	7867913	For example, you know, they did the God of War remakes earlier.
7868293	7869274	Well, guess what?
7869434	7871475	It's a survey going around again.
7871515	7872215	Yep, that's right.
7872255	7874697	The surveys sometimes leak things that Sony are thinking.
7874977	7875637	Survey says?
7879096	7880196	Oh, you didn't see that joke coming.
7880696	7885557	One of the things on the survey, well, the survey said, What titles would you like to see in a future collection?
7885717	7890778	Two or more PS2 titles upgraded with similar features to God of War Collection.
7891418	7900200	And I like this because there's this little screenshot that shows, like, Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, Yakuza, Silent Hill.
7900480	7904121	Like, just every single freaking franchise is being listed in there.
7904221	7904641	But, uh...
7905643	7906163	Show me Twisted Metal!
7924448	7929570	I realize, yes, there's that first generation of consoles that does have it, but most of us don't have it.
7929590	7930370	The better consoles?
7930390	7934732	And we all figured that they would end up selling it at some point, but I don't know.
7934772	7937793	I feel like there's something missing here.
7938633	7944255	Yes, I'm one of those douchebags that has the fully backwards compatible system and doesn't play any PlayStation 2 games on it.
7944275	7945336	Well, congratulations, douchebag.
7946036	7946896	You want to trade PS3s?
7946916	7948997	Because I could sure play Final Fantasy XII.
7949017	7949097	No.
7951838	7954780	Did you ever upgrade your PS3 to lose the other OS feature?
7954800	7955140	Nope.
7955540	7956601	You're still holding out, huh?
7956641	7957482	Still holding out.
7957542	7962405	Haven't played 3D Dot Game Heroes 2 because that would upgrade my system.
7963065	7963926	So I'm loaning it to a friend.
7964406	7968529	Toagak in our chatroom says, very eloquently, fuck PS2 remakes.
7969930	7971791	I mean, are they necessary?
7971831	7973592	I mean, maybe he's posing a good question there.
7974132	7975153	Is this really necessary?
7975413	7975573	No.
7975874	7977515	Well, the God of War collection was pretty cool, though.
7978035	7980937	I mean, HD, widescreen, sexy...
7982111	7986272	DarkTetsuya thinks she should be a game show host, by the way.
7986312	7986352	Me?
7986392	7986512	Yeah.
8008860	8010101	Make, edit, get porn
8037645	8039626	I got second place in that, didn't I?
8040386	8041366	I don't remember as long as I remember.
8041386	8042126	I placed in it.
8042186	8042706	I know I did.
8042726	8044007	I think you and I both placed.
8044467	8057130	But this was where basically you would make an edit to a DDR song because back in the day you could make edits in the home version of DDR and put them in the machines and Loki's favorite edits would receive a free gift of pornography.
8057150	8057970	We did the hell edits.
8058210	8058630	That's right.
8059471	8060991	And it was called Make Edit Get Porn.
8061011	8062671	It was the best contest the station's ever had.
8062691	8064692	I did the DXY version called Another.
8065467	8066268	I got all that XL Saga
8090393	8091954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8115410	8117151	Oh my god, is he still alive?
8119092	8121613	Or is he still fapping right now?
8122214	8122654	I don't know.
8123915	8125035	Alright, moving on.
8125075	8126256	DarkSakura, what you got for us?
8126436	8126836	More news.
8127436	8128497	Yeah, more news.
8129077	8132619	Although, Rob, I'm honestly going to have to ask you your help with the mailbag today.
8132879	8134780	DarkTetsuya is pointing out, that's fine, I'll do my mailbag.
8135020	8139803	DarkTetsuya is pointing out that that highlight is on the best hits that you can download at OrangeLondrina.com.
8141897	8142598	So check it.
8143779	8152667	Well, there is something about Activision working on a GoldenEye title for the Wii and the DS to be released in November.
8153448	8159394	And it's theorized to be a remake of the Nintendo 64 version that Rare put out.
8159636	8161316	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8189935	8217597	Activision is working on a James Bond game a GoldenEye title, Rob and it's supposed to be out for Wii and the DS in theory released in November one of the going rumors about it is that it will be a remake of the Nintendo 64 version which as we all know is epic, classic, the game the game made me sick sick to my stomach Perfect Dark was redone recently and it was pretty awesome
8218723	8238829	that's true but Activision basically let it off at the point that they registered domain names that were named after the film so we might see that coming they also did work on The World is Not Enough right?
8242770	8247752	they've done the last few Bond films they have the rights to do the games for them
8248835	8255821	So, I mean, if they bring us out a remade Goldeneye, that'll be pretty hot.
8256221	8256842	That's gonna be fun.
8256982	8257543	But you know what?
8257583	8259044	I don't think it'll be as good as the original.
8259304	8260125	That's just the problem.
8260225	8261886	You know, nothing is really as ever good as the original.
8262167	8264909	I don't think anything's gonna accurately capture the magic of the original.
8265319	8266580	Well, I beg to differ.
8267340	8276925	Because as I said in part A, when Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes came out on the GameCube, it was a fairly kick-ass version.
8277605	8285409	And don't forget the Resident Evil update where they did Resident Evil on GameCube and it was really hot.
8285950	8287010	Alright, I'll give you that.
8287630	8289311	There have been remakes done right.
8289751	8290252	Alright, we'll see.
8290472	8292613	They just have to make sure to stick with the essence of the game.
8293195	8294196	Alright.
8294636	8298540	I do want to remind folks, sometimes we can't control the downtime of the feed.
8298660	8302083	There's just random hiccups, although I like this comment from SSJ100Matt.
8302403	8304605	Speaking of porn, who's watching it in studio?
8304826	8306467	He said right as the feed went down.
8306727	8307668	Not me.
8308329	8309710	It's comcastic.
8309750	8310371	What can I say?
8310391	8311372	It happens sometimes.
8312071	8315393	Anyhow, let's move on with a few more news stories.
8315413	8316774	Then we're going to get to the mailbag.
8316934	8318415	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
8318435	8320116	We answer your emails live on air.
8320377	8320877	Good times.
8321077	8321457	Loki.
8324099	8324780	Grand Theft Horse.
8325140	8325520	Awesome.
8326681	8333105	So apparently there's been some ratings that have leaked out from the Korean ratings board.
8333665	8337248	And these are some Dreamcast titles that are going to be ported to Xbox Live Arcade.
8337868	8344392	Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi have been submitted for ratings.
8344632	8348694	Sega was unable to officially comment on the ratings.
8348834	8350975	Sonic Adventure has popped up before.
8352776	8356578	I guess they had some screenshots leak out a little bit ago.
8357638	8359199	Crazy Taxi, I think the same thing.
8361120	8364483	Not that I know or anything, but Sonic Adventure is most definitely real.
8365884	8367045	Crazy Taxi is probably the same.
8368586	8370328	I would not be surprised if these get announced at E3.
8372958	8376100	Do you think there's a chance they're going to come out and say, and they're out today!
8376160	8377260	Because that happens once in a while.
8377280	8380062	Sonic Adventure's done, so yeah, I could see that.
8380082	8381082	You could see that happening.
8381102	8382003	It's been done for a while.
8382043	8383243	Definitely could see that happening, huh?
8383484	8385965	Same as Sonic 4, but they're taking their damn time.
8386185	8386545	Alright.
8387886	8392128	Well, let's move on with some more news, and then I guess I'm going to do the mailbag tonight.
8392148	8393989	DarkSakura's not feeling up to it.
8394189	8396350	No, my voice has finally decided to crap out.
8396750	8398472	Dance on Broadway 20 songs from Broadway musicals
8418530	8442731	All That Jazz, Roxy, Cabaret, Money Money, Dream Girls, One Night Only, Luck Be a Lady, Lullaby of Broadway, You Can't Stop the Beat, Good Morning Baltimore, Fame, My Favorite Things, Bend and Snap, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Little Shop of Horrors,
8443772	8449695	Aquarius, Let the Sunshine In, and, and, and, and, the Time Warp.
8452517	8453497	I tried to say woo.
8453517	8456519	DarkSakura's making woo face right now, but you can't hear her.
8457199	8459440	I already know how to do the Time Warp.
8459460	8463443	It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the right.
8463643	8465083	But this is supposed to be like Just Dance.
8465704	8467525	It's pretty much a sequel to Just Dance, right?
8467785	8469186	Yeah, except they're going to have Just Dance too.
8470703	8473725	Well, it's like Guitar Hero 80s edition.
8473745	8477827	It's just dance, super duper gay edition.
8477987	8480048	And that's okay.
8480348	8481549	There's nothing wrong with that.
8481809	8485191	This actually reminds me that people need to stay tuned for Cage Match tonight.
8486592	8487312	Speaking of show tunes.
8487352	8488533	Oh heavens, why is that?
8489633	8490534	Speaking of show tunes.
8492179	8493080	DarkSakura.com
8514540	8518424	Anyhow, in the meantime, we're going to do something we can do on the podcast and live.
8518444	8519946	We love to do this segment every week.
8520506	8522788	It is the mailbag.
8530156	8532458	X-Link in our chatroom says, nothing from Wicked.
8532658	8533059	Fail.
8534220	8535721	No, I actually don't like Wicked.
8535981	8536222	Really?
8536322	8537063	Oh my gosh.
8537463	8538484	Well, no, because I read the book.
8540324	8546285	I can't listen to this as a musical because the book was so dark and gorgeous.
8546946	8547186	All right.
8547566	8553587	Let's see the emails because there's a lot tonight because we kind of have a backlog from all the shows that we didn't do the past couple weeks.
8553607	8559688	So I'm going to start off tonight with this one from... Oh, that's a spam email that came in.
8561908	8564369	Let's do... I don't see...
8567699	8582891	Redertainment Dear OLR, I was listening to your midweek discussion of the inclusion of a keytar in the next rock band game and a thought came to my mind.
8583431	8589716	If this keytar is a plastic instrument with the keys in the body instead of the neck, isn't that like playing the plastic guitar backward?
8590337	8595260	I don't mean playing it left-handed, but playing the guitar turned 180 degrees with the keys on your lap?
8596201	8607787	Also, it seems to me that every numbered version of Rock Band gives the gaming public another gaming-related plastic dust magnet that is incompatible with other games, but gamers feel compelled to buy to play the game.
8608208	8609488	Rock Band gave us a guitar.
8609828	8612010	Rock Band 2 gave us a complete band set.
8612390	8614551	Rock Band 3 will give us a keytar.
8615111	8616672	That makes me wonder... I know, hold on.
8616712	8617613	We got a correction there.
8617933	8621755	That makes me wonder what useless plastic space hog Rock Band 4 will bring us.
8621975	8623055	I vote for maracas.
8623236	8623496	Wait.
8624396	8625577	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8642933	8643753	Thank you for watching!
8660239	8660499	and it's fine.
8660519	8660819	So there you go.
8690943	8698526	Um, our good buddy Rob with two B's, Rob-a-ba-ba-ba, sends us some impressions on Prince of Persia.
8699687	8704128	Says, my boyfriend is a non-gamer, but he really enjoyed the Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.
8704208	8705749	I thought it was fun to watch, too.
8705809	8709851	The criticism that Jake Gyllenhaal was too Caucasian for the role were unfounded.
8710311	8713392	That's because the other two princes in the movie were whiter.
8717054	8717314	Funny.
8718275	8721237	Again, another thing I'm surprised I'm not hearing a lot of comment on this week.
8721457	8722978	Loki, did you happen to see the movie?
8723178	8723598	No.
8723898	8724699	I didn't bother either.
8725859	8731983	The only movie I watched this week is not out yet, so obviously not legally.
8733003	8737346	But it was a good movie, and hopefully it will come out over here at some point, but it's just not yet.
8737819	8740200	Now, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Robway continues,
8753866	8757248	There doesn't seem to be as much pressure to replay levels for Starz either.
8757669	8762752	I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the game, especially after hearing the Super Mario 64 classic as the game of the week.
8763393	8766935	Tune in to a future episode when one of us has actually played the damn game.
8766975	8768676	But my Wii's just not hooked up right now.
8768696	8771478	My Wii's semi-bricked from New Super Mario Bros.
8771618	8773480	Blur and these other games.
8774100	8774300	Really?
8774320	8775061	Your Wii got bricked?
8775361	8776021	Semi-bricked.
8776302	8776822	What's that mean?
8777182	8780544	Semi-bricked is when you play a game of a different region on your system.
8781164	8783606	And what happens is a second update gets put in there.
8784106	8790069	And so now I can play games on it, but I can't go into the system menu and change settings.
8791170	8792010	So I have to fix it.
8792190	8794151	I've just been so lazy to fix it.
8794252	8797273	I really don't care, to be honest.
8797813	8803697	I've been too busy playing other games to actually go and play New Super Mario Bros.
8803977	8804957	or Super Mario Galaxy 2.
8805318	8805638	It's just...
8807239	8808860	I just don't feel compelled to do so.
8809120	8811281	Even if it's super awesome.
8812062	8814383	It's just... I don't know.
8815024	8816545	Although my Trade Other M looks pretty nice.
8817085	8820287	I watched a new video of that this week and it looks pretty cool.
8821388	8821868	Metroid Other M?
8846787	8853573	I'm Too Good Prince of Persia is an average movie, but that means it's like the moon landing for video game movies One small step for man, one giant leap for video game movies to not be a turd of shit
8870482	8874123	I like the turd is now a measurement of shit as opposed to just being another name.
8874183	8874423	All right.
8874643	8875704	I thought it was the Keurig.
8876524	8876924	Forget it.
8877524	8878125	Moving on.
8879785	8882086	Another email from Rob that I want to bring up here.
8882706	8886227	He's suggesting that we should play the 369 music from Schoolhouse Rock for the show.
8886387	8886928	I'm sorry.
8886968	8887708	I didn't have it queued up.
8887748	8888048	My bad.
8888448	8916436	but I do want to address this other point in the email also two weeks ago I saw my first Tron-a-Rail in Disney World that's just what we called it but it turned out to be the official name for the decorated trains any sightings in Disneyland I don't believe they've redone the monorail as Tron I don't think they're planning to do that but you never know when it gets a little closer to the movie releases there was a rumor that the people mover with Tron was going to come back but I'm not holding my breath on that I think if it does it ain't happening this year
8917156	8918437	But no, nothing at Disneyland yet.
8918977	8922439	But we're all waiting on pins and needles that hopefully the PeopleMover will reopen.
8922920	8929244	And also of note, not to turn this into a Disney podcast, but in about, what, one more month, Star Tours will close.
8929864	8932065	And Star Tours is no longer going to be there.
8932906	8933326	Eh, big deal.
8933346	8934007	In its current form.
8934047	8938490	They're redoing it for... There's going to be a Star Wars 2.0 that comes out later.
8938550	8942272	And they're going to make it all stupid in, like, the prequels, so whatever.
8942572	8944534	If it's the pod race, I'm okay with that.
8944774	8947916	Because the pod race, that's the rumor that it's a pod race ride now.
8947956	8949438	And that might be kind of cool.
8949798	8951719	And hopefully you get to run over Jar Jar Binks.
8951879	8952720	That would be amazing.
8953921	8956663	And if Greg Proops is still one of the commentators, that's also amazing.
8956683	8957844	That would be awesome.
8959185	8961265	Oh, that's right, yeah, he was a commentator.
8961285	8962546	Yes, he was one of the two heads.
8962686	8963866	I remember that.
8964086	8965926	No, it'd be funny, though.
8966486	8970147	It's like Robot Chicken and stuff, where they have all the Jar Jar Binks stuff.
8970367	8975508	They should just make it look like it's going to be some sort of pod race.
8975948	8980469	Lock the doors, and it's just all Jar Jar Binks talking to you for a good five minutes.
8981369	8981809	Oh, God.
8981889	8984330	Children would cry and run screaming away.
8984670	8986490	I would complain that my day was not magical.
8988021	8988882	That was not magical.
8989242	8990664	I am not having a magical day now.
8993106	8993767	Alright, moving on.
8994668	8996009	This comes from Shook.
8998393	9019211	Big S, Big K Hi OLR, I'm here for a rant Lately in zombie discussions or something similar People act like they know everything about shotguns and .44s etc When really they're from a big city and have been nowhere near a gun Except maybe in their little gang I'm not trying to sound like some country bumpkin But it really pisses me off when they act like know-it-alls What are your thoughts?
9022210	9023532	Don't make me bust out my Glock.
9023692	9027235	I don't think anyone really wants to shoot somebody in the face.
9027595	9031018	In Red Dead Redemption, it's just funny to see.
9031358	9032078	Does that make sense?
9032879	9033760	I am an adult.
9033960	9036082	I understand what is fiction and what is real.
9036102	9039564	I'm not going to go shoot someone in the face if it's going to kill them.
9039845	9046290	And I will be the first to admit, I don't know the difference between all these different types of guns because I don't like guns and I would never own a gun.
9046330	9046770	Wait, what guns?
9046790	9047491	What are we talking about guns?
9047851	9049532	Shotguns and 44s, etc.
9049832	9051614	Just saying I know everything about these guns.
9051774	9053975	Not me specifically, but just people.
9054135	9056056	I can't wait until I own a gun.
9056917	9058378	I'm not getting into this topic again.
9058398	9060739	I learned a lot about guns from playing Airsoft.
9060879	9063341	Because a lot of the guns that they have out there are modeled.
9063921	9065783	Now I can say, hey, that's an MP7.
9065803	9066343	Oh, hey, that's a G36.
9066403	9067103	It's kind of cool.
9071246	9077069	you know how I learned about guns very well writing G.I.
9077109	9084013	Joe fanfiction about 10 years ago I'm not joking 10 years ago I was writing G.I.
9084033	9099001	Joe fanfiction and I did my research I have no interest in firing a gun that is not of the laser variety or the shooting range I still I do still want a Hello Kitty we should go out to the shooting range I want to go
9100339	9101260	Our friend used to go down there.
9101540	9103501	I was going to go with him, but he moved too soon.
9103521	9104942	I'll have to take a picture of this.
9105242	9106723	Dan got to shoot off a .50 caliber.
9108324	9110206	One more, you guys, from Dragonboy69.
9110546	9120873	I was wondering if any of you might know why some games, specifically Vagrant Story and Breath of Fire 3, show up on the Japan and European PSN store, but not on the North American store.
9121233	9122394	Thanks for any help you can provide.
9122474	9123174	Keep up the great work.
9123755	9126276	Because Vagrant Story sucked?
9126817	9127117	What?
9127677	9152288	but wait here's the thing just sometimes it's a rights issue and Final Fantasy 9 I think is another big one right like it's showing up in other stores but not the current one just it's rights issues and sometimes timing and other things it's sometimes kind of complicated I think it has to do with the fact that sometimes different companies publish different games in different countries and that sometimes complicate things but I think Wikipedia keeps a pretty good list of what's available yeah it's true too
9152748	9159055	I'm posting this picture up on the site of my Hello Kitty holding a .50 caliber shell.
9159952	9166915	And also, too, it's sometimes just the ability for that company to be able to distribute the game in a timely manner.
9167255	9177420	Like, for example, MorphX, which was a game that came out in Europe just recently, is actually region-coded for both Europe and the North American regions.
9177880	9187444	So, in theory, you could actually release the game here and it would be just fine, but for whatever reason, you know, it may have not passed the ratings board yet, maybe they don't have enough...
9188304	9191647	Manpower to actually duplicate the units that they need.
9191667	9204495	Some of these companies, like Graffiti Entertainment or Zoo Games and stuff, their titles go for sometimes years of delays before they're actually released.
9205236	9206076	It's ridiculous.
9206997	9207858	Graffiti Entertainment.
9208318	9209579	That's going to do it for our mailbag.
9209659	9213261	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you'd like to send us an email, please do.
9213381	9215283	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9216306	9219849	After the Mailbag is usually the section of the show where we get a little irritated.
9220510	9223593	And we do a little segment on the show called the FUs of the Week.
9223913	9224313	Why?
9224914	9225775	Because we can.
9241738	9245799	And if you need a little inspiration, we have an inspiration for your FU story tonight.
9246359	9249340	It's about a Virginia man named Bruce Jamar Walston.
9250021	9257103	Apparently, authorities were called to his apartment by the girlfriend because apparently, a couple nights ago, the woman called 911.
9260704	9261904	You're not going to like this, folks.
9262184	9263885	You're really not going to like this, okay?
9265245	9270807	And this really doesn't have anything to do with video games, but it does because I'm making the rounds on video game blogs, but just...
9271854	9272555	You're not going to like it.
9273215	9275037	You're really not going to like this.
9276379	9287550	Apparently, the guy here that was arrested, Bruce Walston, was angered that the video game he was playing was disconnected by his girlfriend's new kitten.
9288431	9289912	So he picked up the animal.
9291034	9293216	I'm not going to say what happened, but the animal died.
9296334	9301600	And this all occurred, wait for it, wait for it, in front of the woman's children.
9304543	9310369	He's being held without bond at the Middle River Regional Gerald in Verona in case you want to send him your cards and letters.
9311410	9314213	For killing a kitten, for unplugging the video game console.
9314574	9317217	Not only did he kill the cat, he did it in front of the children.
9319712	9324536	Psychopath Mental Problems
9340467	9341168	Thanks for watching!
9360200	9360480	DarkSakura.com
9384690	9386311	Who would like to start... Good without Bond.
9386372	9388213	Would you like to start off with the FUs of the week, DarkSakura?
9388233	9389594	Do you have some inspiration now?
9390795	9391616	I'm disgusted.
9392657	9393258	I know, it's disgusting.
9393278	9394098	I said you wouldn't like it.
9397021	9397301	What?
9397762	9399343	Dan said it's better he didn't kill the kid.
9399363	9399864	It's better than...
9403533	9404574	Dan is yelling from the living room.
9404614	9407298	Jamie would be less mad if the guy had killed the kid.
9409441	9409861	Whatever.
9410082	9411063	It's still messed up.
9411123	9412465	No matter what, it's messed up.
9412765	9413045	Alright.
9413646	9414567	I'm going to make mine quick.
9415068	9415248	Yes.
9415288	9419654	My first FU goes towards losing my voice and the little bit of cough I have left.
9420615	9441209	My next one is a humongous FU to Helen Thomas who is one of the senior White House press corps members who basically went on record saying that Jews should get out of Palestine and go back to Germany or Poland.
9443050	9443470	Yeah.
9444411	9446012	She didn't say go back to Jew land.
9447953	9450095	Well, it's...
9451653	9457599	First of all, telling people to go back to places that, you know, they basically left due to, um, how about being murdered?
9458821	9459141	You know?
9459922	9464146	To go back to their homeland is just really insensitive.
9464166	9467830	Maybe Helen Thomas should go back to her homeland, because I don't think she's Native American.
9467910	9469892	So, um, boat's coming.
9470013	9470433	Get on it.
9470793	9471054	Bye.
9472927	9480779	It's just really, really... And you know, the only reason, she did apologize for it, but the only reason I think she apologized for it... She got caught.
9481099	9482141	Because they called her on it.
9482922	9487489	And now they're calling for her resignation, or her to get sacked, and honestly...
9488130	9488551	I agree.
9489051	9499740	Now, if she had her own personal private blog and said this as herself with a these views do not reflect White House blah blah blah fine.
9499860	9500521	Insensitive.
9501141	9501862	Shitty as hell.
9502402	9503864	You're still a bitch, but...
9504524	9506885	But this is America.
9508025	9510826	She has the right to be a bitch and we have the right to call her a bitch.
9510886	9512067	That's what free speech is all about.
9512087	9520230	But to say it in her capacity in a public forum as a representative of the White House press corps, as a senior representative.
9521030	9524391	Now tell me that's just not highly irresponsible and incredibly insensitive.
9525311	9526152	I think she should get sacked.
9527932	9529873	And drawn behind a cart by her toes.
9530649	9532871	I want to see Obama just punch her on the White House lawn.
9532891	9533512	That'd be amazing.
9533792	9534813	Just go, bitch!
9536835	9542700	But yeah, and that's just... Not that I'm advocating violence, but in special circumstances, it's okay.
9542880	9543781	And you know what is funny?
9544102	9547024	Because her apology is not even...
9547845	9552887	She's saying that she deeply regretted the comments I made last week regarding Israelis and Palestinians.
9552947	9559850	They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance.
9560290	9561311	May that day come soon.
9561711	9563431	She didn't really address what she said.
9564672	9565112	Not at all.
9565752	9570514	She just let out a blanket statement to appease everybody that doesn't really address the problem.
9571835	9574396	If she was going to have any sincerity of it, she was going to say, you know what?
9575076	9575657	I was wrong.
9576357	9576697	Sorry.
9579457	9586979	F you to myself for having the obsessive compulsion to spend money on stupid things that I really don't need to spend money on like Project Under $100 for example
9602526	9604146	Not that it's going to stop me from doing it.
9606767	9609427	And also the fact that I don't have any airsoft guns.
9610267	9614168	And I'm also not in the airsoft community right now because I don't have any airsoft guns.
9614468	9617069	Because I really want the Magpul PTS FPG.
9617569	9619549	The folding pocket gun looks so awesome.
9620149	9625810	And it's a gun that folds out of a briefcase shape into a little personal assault rifle.
9625830	9626470	And that's awesome.
9626650	9627230	Good times.
9627310	9628991	But it's also really expensive and I don't need it.
9629471	9630331	At least I'm not buying it.
9632252	9640741	My FU of the week goes to the returning side pains that I've been having because, yeah, that's why I went to the hospital a couple of years ago and I really don't want to go back.
9641683	9644245	Maybe it's Mother Nature trying to tell me I need to go on a diet again.
9644406	9646988	I don't know, but I don't like being freaked out like that.
9647189	9647669	It sucks.
9648570	9649410	A few to my body.
9650450	9650771	Wah.
9651791	9655632	Alright, let's move on with just a couple more news stories for you guys.
9655692	9656892	Then the Skype line.
9657292	9658432	We'll get to the Skype line here.
9658992	9665554	Admittedly, it's going to be a little bit shorter Skype line tonight because we had a really long show and we still have an afterbirth yet too before it gets too late.
9665594	9668214	But we will at least take some calls here in just a little bit.
9668255	9670235	In the meantime, Loki, what you got for us?
9670615	9677662	Games Convention Online in Leipzig is actually going to be going industry only this year.
9677863	9683448	Apparently, I guess they had 43,000 attendees in 2009.
9684509	9691897	And now they're just saying the number of registered public exhibitors was insufficient.
9693178	9699300	and that satisfy the interests of the visitors whose past experiences bring them with high expectations to Leipzig.
9701501	9705323	It doesn't make sense why they're going to cut it, but they're planning on, I guess...
9707637	9735096	Having 30 companies attending this year, which is already bigger than last year But it will not be open to the public So it's basically, this show's got too many common folk at it So in order for our show to get bigger For business to happen, it's basically what E3 did But, I mean, this is maybe a good example of why we don't have E3 open to the public Because it would be a nut house Alright
9736930	9738952	Let's move on with one more story
9754202	9758626	Keep in mind, this is only announced stuff, because there's always surprises.
9758986	9760888	Always, always, always surprises at E3.
9760928	9765051	So don't take this as the definitive list of the only things being shown at E3.
9765131	9767153	This is just what is confirmed thus far.
9767993	9774439	2K Games is showing Mafia 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V, Spec Ops The Line, and XCOM.
9774699	9776400	I didn't even know they were remaking XCOM.
9776420	9780884	Yeah, it's supposed to be not so much like... It's more like a first-person shooter now.
9781107	9786889	I might remember hearing it on a previous show or something, but this is the first time I remember hearing it right now.
9788650	9789010	Let's see.
9789230	9794612	Activision has Call of Duty Black Ops and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock, and supposedly that's it.
9794732	9795893	I somehow doubt that.
9796533	9801955	Bethesda's bringing Brink, Fallout New Vegas, Hunted the Demon's Forge, and Rage.
9802655	9807457	Capcom 2 has Dead Rising 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and an untitled sequel.
9809690	9810891	Let's see.
9811011	9812312	I'm ignoring the mobile stuff.
9812392	9816895	Disney Interactive Studios has Epic Mickey, Guilty Party, Pirates.
9817055	9819116	Are they really going to call that game Epic Mickey?
9819136	9820717	I think that's a stupid title.
9820857	9822338	It may be just the working title right now.
9822418	9823198	God, I hope it is.
9823258	9827361	Let me go on record saying that is a stupid name for a video game.
9828061	9833862	Pirates of the Caribbean, Armada of the Damned, Toy Story 3, Tron Evolution, and Tron Legacy.
9833942	9835442	Hey, I'm all about checking out the Tron.
9835462	9836202	Those are supposed to be cool.
9836422	9838023	Yeah, I want to see what that looks like.
9838043	9838723	That's going to be awesome.

9897691	9900192	As I said earlier in the show, notice no DDR in that list.
9901533	9902574	Could DDR be dead?
9903134	9903355	Nope.
9903915	9905396	I will tell you what they're probably going to do.
9906216	9907157	Surprise announcement?
9907437	9909959	They're going to make an announcement that's going to support Natal.
9911149	9911549	You think?
9912930	9931098	I have a feeling Alright, we'll see what happens Because, you know, Konami, they like doing gimmicky shit that doesn't make any sense for the franchise whatsoever For example, what they were showing off at last E3 with Dance Dance Revolution Playing Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii Fit balance board using your ass That made no fucking sense
9931778	9934661	Do you guys want some video at E3 of me playing Def Jam Rapstar?
9937304	9940087	You know who I want to see video playing that?
9940267	9940788	Irene.
9942029	9943691	I wish she could go to E3 this year.

10128261	10136882	Fear 3, Lego Harry Potter, Years 1 through 4, Lord of the Rings, Eragon's Quest, Lord of the Rings, War in the North, and last but not least, Super Scribblenauts.

10140043	10140463	There it is.
10140543	10141863	A list of what is being shown to E3.
10142163	10143603	Sounds like it's going to be a fun year, isn't it?
10145824	10147264	I know I... I think it's with adjectives now.
10147344	10147844	I'm excited.
10147864	10148704	I'm sorry, that's what I meant.
10148804	10149785	Adjectives, not verbs.
10149865	10151445	Don't you have all of it, though, it seems like?
10152145	10152325	No.
10153790	10155171	It'd be hard to spawn a verb.
10155611	10156371	Spawn run.
10160913	10161253	All right.
10162033	10166855	Well, this is the part of the show where we're going to get to some last minute stories because, well, actually, I take that back.
10166875	10168115	We already have calls coming in.
10168576	10169736	Let's go to the Skype line.
10169776	10174078	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10174118	10175518	We're going to go to the Skype line right now.
10175538	10176619	We've already got calls coming in.
10176679	10176899	Hi.
10177219	10177939	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10177959	10178239	Who's this?
10179780	10180800	It's Ray Iannami.
10180920	10182081	Hey, Ray Iannami.
10182101	10182781	What's on your mind, buddy?
10184570	10186571	I've been back from Fanime for about a week now.
10187371	10189951	Fanime was over Memorial Day weekend.
10190011	10191212	Sadly, I was not there.
10191352	10192292	I was in Portland.
10192332	10193492	But how was Fanime this year?
10195693	10196373	Pretty fun.
10197213	10198513	It seems to get better every year.
10200374	10204855	And there's a few crappy parts, but it doesn't detract from the experience as a whole, usually.
10206135	10210976	Well, first things first, I've got to ask, since it is a video game show, how is the game room at Fanime?
10212222	10213783	Okay, I can't think back.
10213803	10223488	So, Gaming Room for Arcades, they had like the usual stuff from last year, but this time they have a few new things like Mushihime-sama and DJ Max Technica.
10223929	10230412	I was especially excited to see Technica, even if they didn't have the Platinum Crew servers, but I expected it not to be there anyway.
10231553	10233874	Do they wheel that all over from SVGL or something?
10234855	10235935	Um, actually, no.
10236015	10238297	From what I've heard, like some years ago...
10239235	10249718	There's some fallout between Fanami and Goffland, so now Fanami gets their machines from university arcades, like someone from San Jose State and UCLA.
10250478	10250939	Oh, okay.
10251619	10252279	Gotcha.
10252539	10254220	Yeah, we ended up getting UCLA's machine.
10255940	10256680	Hmm, interesting.
10257221	10257921	Well, that's cool.
10257961	10259001	It sounds like Gamer was fun.
10260222	10264843	Consulate Gaming was a bit of a letdown this year, mainly because there weren't as many TVs, like
10266078	10273222	The concentration of people playing fighting games to people playing other games like Classy Games and Shmucks and such was really high this year.
10274383	10286310	Like, you pick a random TV, four to five times it's probably going to be Brawl or something else, or Rock Band or something.
10286330	10288751	I say it pretty much every damn con gaming room.
10291147	10292387	What about some cosplay?
10292447	10294088	Was there any good gaming cosplay?
10294128	10295969	I know DarkSakura was showing me a picture earlier.
10295989	10298310	I don't think it was from Fanime, but some Metal Gear cosplay.
10298610	10300070	Was there any good gaming cosplay you saw?
10300090	10303091	Um, yeah.
10304732	10305592	Well, like what?
10305992	10309914	I saw a picture of a Vanille from Final Fantasy XIII that looked really cute.
10310354	10311374	I thought she did a good job.
10311514	10312335	What did you see?
10312695	10319097	I saw a lot of Toho cosplay, though that's mainly because I went to the Toho gathering and the explosion of Toho-related events on Sunday.
10320552	10332601	I'm looking at some of your pictures, it looks like there was a Pac-Man there I'm looking at, and I'm looking at a Black Mage and a Sackboy Loki's Sackboy costume is better though
10347762	10350764	I saw some BlazBlue cosplay, like Hazama and Lychee.
10350784	10351504	Oh, that's cool.
10352385	10357868	I saw a couple Captain Falcons, which is one of the alternate palettes from Super Smash Bros., interestingly.
10359048	10364111	There's also the guy who does British cosplay every year, so glad to see him every year.
10365812	10368594	Now, what's this about where there were some protesters?
10368754	10370455	Were people protesting Faname?
10370495	10371155	What's up with this?
10372076	10373897	They weren't protesting Faname, per se.
10374037	10374277	It's a...
10375012	10383016	It's basically, you know about those Fire and Brimstone preachers that go turn or burn and such like that?
10383416	10384216	Oh, yeah, yeah.
10384256	10384977	You always see them out.
10385017	10388198	Like, even when I was in Portland, there was one out at the fair.
10388238	10394942	They do, like, a cute little fair downtown where a lot of local vendors come out and sell their, you know, local goods.
10394982	10402505	And there was some guy standing there on the street corner, you know, spouting their whole thing about, you know, everybody's going to hell and that whole thing.
10402985	10404106	So, Faname got a little bit of that?
10406143	10430980	Oh, I came across a Guitar Freaks V4 machine with EMU slots, but it's not connected to EMUs No, I don't really play Guitar Freaks or Drum Mania, I'm more of a 2DX person and VGMAX person
10433232	10434053	Yeah, they did.
10435194	10440478	And interestingly, it was a hacked version of 2DX Empress with DJ Maxx Crossovers and other things on it.
10440498	10445021	I didn't play it because the screen was laggy, and laggy screens make me rage quit.
10445781	10446582	Wait, wait, wait.
10447303	10451265	There was DJ Maxx Crossovers in this game?
10451986	10452486	Is it a hack?
10453667	10458511	Yeah, someone hacked some DJ Maxx songs into 2DX, which was very interesting.
10459371	10461293	I've seen a video of it on YouTube before.
10464301	10465341	Hmm, interesting.
10466101	10469642	Well, I didn't even know something like that existed, but that's cool.
10470143	10472823	Well, any other thoughts on Fandomay you want to tell us before we let you go?
10474544	10475004	Hmm.
10476224	10482806	I think what Fandomay could do next year for their console gaming is maybe have one section where there's no fighting games or anything like that.
10483266	10490528	Like, classic games and shooters and other things that don't require you to kick ass and have fun.
10490548	10490608	Hmm.
10491872	10494574	I'm all about a classic game room like they have at PAX.
10494634	10495054	Good stuff.
10507068	10510790	I haven't seen you guys since 2007, so I'm getting worried if I'll ever see you at Fanime again.
10510810	10511450	I'll go to Fanime next year.
10511470	10513071	I think it's in July, aka next month.
10527128	10531631	Maybe we'll go to that, because I've never been to California Extreme, and I'd really like to go.
10531731	10532631	What do you think, DarkSakura?
10532671	10532791	Do it.
10532812	10534713	Do you think we'll make it to July?
10535013	10535693	We'll see what we can do.
10536073	10540656	I'm not going to make any promises yet, but July would be a lot better than June, so maybe.
10542057	10546780	All right, well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you so much for your call, and have fun.
10547617	10548378	Alright, see ya Later
10566031	10567893	Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
10567913	10568413	Um, I had, um...
10590947	10598550	One question that kind of ties in very loosely to the last call that you had.
10600291	10605953	I was kind of wondering, is there any retro games that you would love to see either in...
10607057	10613085	Microsoft Game Room or on PSN that's not already there or hasn't been announced?
10624759	10627782	I would love to see stuff like Impossible Mission and so forth released over here.
10641733	10652218	I hope that my earlier inkling that if Game Room is going to reach thousands of games, then they're going to dip into the old Apple IIe library and the Commodore 64 library and some of that.
10652498	10657100	I hope my inkling there is correct because there's lots of Commodore 64 games I would love to see get the treatment.
10657160	10661022	I mean, you guys should see some of the EA games back when they were ECA.
10661082	10662363	They made some pretty epic games.
10663083	10665564	Mule, M-U-L-E, was a great game on the 64.
10666204	10667345	I'd love to see make a comeback.
10668765	10673306	There's just a lot of those classic computer games of yesteryear I would love to see.
10673926	10675847	And if that happens on PSN, that would be great too.
10676207	10681448	Although I sort of see the classic stuff on PSN as being more of a Sony-based thing usually.
10681868	10683508	I don't usually see a lot of old stuff.
10683768	10684489	But you know what's interesting?
10684529	10686089	There has been some obscure stuff.
10686109	10687369	Let me give you one retro title.
10687829	10690770	Digger HD is out on PlayStation Network.
10690790	10692270	And it's kind of an overlooked title.
10692550	10695171	But it's a remake of an old, old PC game.
10695211	10696051	And what's really cool...
10696531	10699312	The old PC game is in there and playable.
10699932	10710395	It's not one of my favorite classic games and not one that necessarily necessitated the treatment it got, but I think it's an example of a retro remake done really well.
10711335	10713456	And that is on PlayStation Network and not on 360.
10713776	10715956	It's only on PSN, Digger HD.
10716016	10717477	It's worth a look.
10717897	10718417	Oh, yeah.
10718797	10719998	Yeah, I got that one, too.
10720458	10724559	In fact, I got that, too, I went to see roughly about a month and a half ago.
10724599	10725219	It's pretty good.
10726433	10741923	Yeah, at least in terms of game room, what I would love to see is virtually any old classic Capcom game.
10743024	10751049	Capcom, before they really started going gung-ho on home consoles, they've been known for their arcade titles, whether it be the 1940 series, the
10754261	10761029	Street Fighter series, Ghosts and Goblins, and so on and so forth.
10761129	10772323	Game Room badly needs other publishers on board because right now the only Game Room games that are coming out are Atari, Activision, Intellivision,
10772703	10773343	and Konami.
10773803	10774344	That's it.
10774704	10778045	We are not seeing games from at least I can think of off the top of my head.
10778325	10780986	I don't believe there are any other publishers games showing up in Game Room.
10781366	10785228	Which is odd because they promised this thousand games thing earlier.
10785888	10788669	And what's also strange to me, this week in Game Room
10789757	10792819	GamePacks 3 and 4 were packs of 14 games split into 2 weeks worth of releases.
10792839	10798983	GamePack 5 just came out and we got 5 games this week, which makes me think it's going to be 3 weeks worth now.
10813792	10817214	They're stretching these game packs out longer and longer.
10817294	10819535	Like, they are going to run out of games.
10821156	10826358	My hope is that they are going to make some big announcements at E3, and that's kind of why we're waiting.
10826738	10832041	Because right now, okay, well, the three weeks for Game Pack 5 would take us right through the end of E3.
10832361	10834222	There was also a delay this week.
10834722	10836463	Game Pack 5 was held up by a day.
10836863	10839965	And I don't know if maybe this all plays into it, but I really hope...
10840405	10845326	that they are coming out at E3 and saying, hey, we have these other publishers on board for Game Room.
10845927	10848827	If they don't do that, Game Room is doomed.
10849388	10853389	And it's really a bummer because there's so much potential with Game Room.
10853789	10857310	Although I fired up Video Pinball this week, which was one of the releases.
10858050	10861331	Yeah, not what I remember when I was six.
10861651	10863251	I was kind of disappointed.
10864932	10868413	Yeah, in fact, I had just recently bought...
10870037	10890638	Super Breakouts, and, you know, as Bobby Blackwell pointed out on his show, you know, without the panel, it is kind of a pain in the arse to play Daggy, but still, even with that being said, you know, there's the whole nostalgia factor, you know, considering that, you
10892565	10897508	I think the first game I ever played was Syphon Blackjack on the 2600, so there's something behind that.
10909355	10909615	DarkSakura.com
10936496	10960849	and I've gone on this tangent in previous shows I'm really worried that Game Room is going to be a giant disappointment and it's almost more disappointing because if it doesn't work you're not going to see anyone else want to try it and there was such good ideas here but I really think those Chrome layoffs affected things harder than they claimed it was going to but I hope they're at E3 because I'm going to ask some questions I can't wait
10962645	10983629	Yeah, I really hope that, you know, despite the layoffs, they do manage to really turn out the games for it and they get all the support from the gaming community that they deserve, you know, because I just hate to have to wait another generation or two for something similar to Game Room, you know?
10984229	10985289	Let's hope, let's hope.
10985589	10990010	Spazinator, I've got to let you go because we're going to go and wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for your call, okay?
10991585	10992185	All right, sure.
10992205	10992626	Have a good one.
10992806	10993306	You too, buddy.
10994367	10994667	All right.
10995387	10996688	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10996748	11003071	I'm sorry to close the phones, but we're kind of running long tonight because part A was really, really long tonight.
11003091	11004172	It was almost two hours long.
11004232	11009095	So unfortunately, I am going to close up the Skype line so we can kind of wrap up the show because we still have an after work to get to and all that fun stuff.
11009815	11010656	And last minute stories.
11010696	11014098	We haven't let Loki finish last minute stories, but I did want to invite callers.
11014198	11015518	Please email us right now.
11015578	11017299	Mailbag at orange lounge reader dot com.
11017319	11019080	Get your thoughts out so we can read them on next week's show.
11019701	11019901	Loki.
11020541	11022184	Yes, other things.
11022785	11025651	There was a game that I think we talked about a long time ago.
11026172	11030259	It was a Grand Theft Auto kind of demake, I guess.
11030720	11031621	They were doing...
11033703	11034764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11055943	11057445	and it looks pretty awesome.
11057465	11072061	They're going to have a bunch of different parodies on different things like Metal Gear, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and whatnot, Sonic and the game itself is pretty much an open world action game just like the old school top down Grand Theft Autos.
11072942	11073183	Huh.
11073343	11074464	So that's pretty sweet.
11074804	11075225	Interesting.
11075785	11075986	Yeah.
11080774	11088939	Apparently some of the Nintendo portables, the DSi XL, they are getting some new colors of the DSi XL.
11089560	11092862	There's going to be yellow, blue, and green coming out in Japan.
11093642	11098906	And also in time for all that stuff, they're going to be dropping the price as well.
11099686	11102787	So cutting it down from 20,000 yen to 18,000 yen.
11102847	11106149	And the DSI will also drop down from 18,900 yen to about 15,000 yen.
11114391	11115572	So that's kind of interesting.
11115592	11118715	I guess that's kind of getting ready for the 3DS.
11118795	11120776	Yeah, that blue one's kind of pretty, though.
11120796	11121357	So is the green one.
11121657	11122558	Yellow one I could do without.
11122918	11123779	Yeah.
11124159	11129464	And then also in the UK, the DSi is getting the price drop as well.
11129544	11131746	Could they be announcing one on stage next week?
11131806	11132447	Yeah.
11132467	11134348	Could that possibly be happening?
11135149	11138192	Yeah, and the funny thing is these are all starting on June 18th.
11141222	11141643	June 18th.
11141723	11147165	Yeah, that does coincide with something, I'm sure, if I put my mind to it.
11148465	11158089	And yeah, they will be dropping the price as well from 150 euros to looks like 120 to 130 euros around there.
11160050	11160590	Interesting.
11164412	11167673	There's a rumor that Kim Kardashian is going to be the next Lara Croft.
11168574	11169358	Whatever.
11171670	11174011	Got the assets to be Lara Croft, but that's about it.
11174051	11175651	She can't act her way out of a box.
11176651	11176991	Whatever.
11177171	11177732	I don't really care.
11178972	11188815	Motorstorm 3 apparently is going post-apocalyptic, and this is coming from some screens leaked on the French website PS3Gen.
11190035	11201318	They have what they claim to be some stolen images of Motorstorm 3 showing kind of a, I guess, San Francisco map that has buildings crumbling and whatnot.
11202823	11207420	To me, if this is actually real, this is kind of what Fuel should have been, but
11209204	11209844	I kind of like that.
11209864	11210665	I think that'd be kind of cool.
11210925	11214647	I didn't really get into the last Motorstorm game, but the first one was pretty good.
11214767	11215547	Could be interesting.
11216388	11217128	I'm interested.
11218089	11223272	And then finally, Def Jam Rapstar is going to be coming out I guess this year.
11223992	11227614	Europe, October 5th and North America, November 6th.
11228174	11231376	The game will retail for $69.99 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and $59.99 on the Wii.
11231396	11232497	I'm assuming it comes with one microphone.
11237679	11240542	and some of the songs that have been announced for it.
11241202	11258535	They've got Biz Marquis' Just a Friend, Drake's Best I Ever Had, Ice Cube's With It Was a Good Day, Outkast's So Fresh, So Clean by Pete Rock and CL Smooth's The Reminisce Is Over You, Troy.
11261242	11269367	Oh, also Redman's and Method Man's Da Rock Wilder and Salt Peppers Push It.
11269427	11270408	Push it real good.
11270448	11282034	They're going to have a freestyle mode as well as a couple of original instrumental tracks, which I guess will tie in with the freestyle mode.
11284275	11284776	Interesting.
11285717	11301274	comments from our chat room chat.org.com salaciouspop commenting on the Kim Kardashian role you can't do backflips with an ass that fat I'm Too Good says if the second Lara Croft movie was the first one it wouldn't have bombed it was much better than the first hmm
11304033	11305494	I never saw either one, I gotta admit.
11305935	11307255	I don't watch a lot of video game movies.
11307295	11308376	I did see Resident Evil.
11308436	11310017	Silent Hill was obviously the last one I saw.
11310457	11311058	That's a good one.
11311078	11312238	I want to go back and watch that again.
11312899	11314920	I thought it was underrated by most people, but whatevs.
11316001	11318122	Different movies for different people, I suppose.
11318797	11319077	DarkSakura.com
11333997	11335798	We might just have to give them what they want.
11336218	11339060	We are the show where every gamer has a voice after all, so we'll be doing that.
11339380	11341901	We might be actually doing a press conference live.
11342061	11346083	I just have to steal the audio from another site, so we'll have to figure that out.
11346123	11350065	If anybody knows of a site that's doing the audio live Sunday, please... Which one is it?
11350486	11350986	Microsoft?
11351046	11352206	The Cirque du Soleil one.
11352447	11352847	It's the Natal one.
