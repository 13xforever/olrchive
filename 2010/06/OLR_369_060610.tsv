0	19720	Tonight, June 6th, 2010, a lawsuit is filed against Final Fantasy XIII.
19720	23880	Rumors say a new dance game is coming to Project Atoll, and could you soon pay a new tax on
23880	31760	your consumer electronics?
31760	35840	Hello my friends and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35840	39720	We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
39720	47680	It is episode number 369 for this June the 6th of 2010, 69.
47680	48680	My name is Rob Roberts.
48680	51400	I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
51400	54840	First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
54840	55840	Hi.
55840	56840	How are you?
56840	57840	Ahhh.
57840	61520	I see, needing a good oiling apparently.
61520	68180	This is the first day I've actually felt somewhat decent, so I've been sick, but I am mostly
68180	69940	over it, a little leftover.
69940	71640	My voice may go out during the show.
71640	72640	You know what you need?
72640	73640	A lozenge.
73640	77240	You need, well that, and you need salad.
77240	79040	Because I took, I had salad today.
79040	82400	I went to, just like, for anybody who listened to last week's show, I went to Fresh Choice,
82400	83400	just like Jamie.
83400	84720	I saw your picture of your lovely salad.
84720	86520	I sent you a tweet.
86520	88400	But I have been eating salad all weekend.
88400	92160	I had an epic salad yesterday, Rob.
92160	93160	Get this.
93160	94560	And so there's different levels of salad.
94560	98900	There's like, you know, there's level one salad, your like basic house salad, then there's
98900	100920	epic salad of awesomeness.
100920	109840	My epic salad had used red vein chard, which chard is delicious, and raw squash, and roma
109840	119160	tomatoes, and dehydrated apples, and chives, and, what else did I put in that thing?
119160	121880	Because I put a lot of, oh, pea sprouts.
121880	122880	Pea shoots, sorry, pea shoots.
122880	123880	And broccoli.
123880	126120	And occasionally we do talk about video games here at Orange Lawns Radio.
126120	127120	With a raspberry vinaigrette.
127120	128120	Now is that-
128120	130840	But don't put your video games in raspberry vinaigrette, it won't work anymore.
130840	131840	Epic.
131840	132840	It sounds pretty epic.
132840	133840	It was really good.
133840	134840	Alright.
134840	135840	I'm gonna have gelato today.
135840	138240	Also here, I've got to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki.
138240	139240	Hello.
139240	140240	How are you doing, Loki?
140240	141240	I'm full.
141240	142240	You're full?
142240	143240	What have you been eating?
143240	144240	Not a salad.
144240	145240	I can see that.
145240	146240	I don't know, breadsticks.
146240	147240	Breadsticks.
147240	148240	Yeah.
148240	149240	This should be like a food MMO.
149240	150240	I don't know.
150240	152240	Let's go to Sizzler, the MMO.
152240	153240	No.
153240	155240	Don't need that.
155240	156240	Alright.
156240	164200	Anyhow, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.
164200	167640	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
167640	174440	So, do pull up a chair and join us in our chat room if you are listening live, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
174440	176480	We're gonna be talking video games over the next few hours.
176480	179520	Tonight, lots of E3 rumors and kind of things.
179520	183480	You know, we're in that period where E3 is, you know, right around the corner.
183480	185840	Obviously, we're, what, eight days away from the first?
185840	186840	No.
186840	188560	Actually, we're one week away from the first press conference.
188560	193920	If you count the Cirque du Soleil project, the tall thing, where they're gonna announce
193920	199600	the real name of it, which I heard a little rumor, take it with a grain of salt, Xbox
199600	200600	Wave.
200600	201600	Oh, no.
201600	202600	How would you feel about that as the name?
202600	206960	Do you think that's a good name for a peripheral, Xbox Wave?
206960	207960	It's interesting.
207960	209360	I could see them doing little like tidal waves.
209360	211260	Jamie's like waving her hand.
211260	213320	At least it's not the Xbox Flail.
213320	215240	That's I guess a little better.
215240	218280	That's, that would be if they put Para Para on it.
218280	219280	We'll see.
219280	220680	Take that with a gigantic grain of salt.
220680	226360	I was, I just had a thought about the Natal thing and Para Para.
226360	227360	What's that?
227360	228600	Could you imagine that?
228600	229600	It could happen.
229600	232880	We actually have a story a little later on about what might be happening with Natal and
232880	233880	music based games.
233880	234880	It's very interesting.
234880	235880	So we'll be getting into that a little while.
235880	239960	Xbox just made me think about it and I was like, Pala Pala.
239960	242160	This is gonna be a very interesting E3.
242160	245120	Like, you know, last year's, I'm gonna admit, I'm just gonna be honest.
245120	246840	I was kind of disappointed with last year's E3.
246840	247840	I mean, sure.
247840	248840	So was I.
248840	249840	I didn't even go.
249840	253040	There was a few things that came out of it that were kind of, you know, kind of cool.
253040	256920	But otherwise the show was just kind of like a lot of it was behind closed doors.
256920	261280	A lot of it was more conceptual because you had, you know, Natal and Moov being announced
261280	267280	but nothing, and I guess the Vitality sensor to some extent, but nothing really being shown.
267280	271840	You know, so I think this year we're really gonna see what is going to be out on the shelves
271840	272840	this Christmas.
272840	274400	And there's gonna be a lot fighting for your attention this year.
274400	275400	It'll be very interesting.
275400	277360	I like when things fight for my attention.
277360	278360	All right.
278360	279360	Usually to the death.
279360	283240	Well, we'll be getting into E3 and rumors and news and all that in just a little bit.
283240	286400	We are gonna start off tonight's show as we always do, however, with a little bit of how
286400	287400	was your gaming week.
287400	290640	So what was fighting to the death for your attention this week in your gaming world,
290640	291640	Dark Sakura?
291640	297520	Well, as I was playing just a moment ago, I was playing some Portal, but I really have
297520	305080	to owe it to a lot of Star Trek Online because I realized that I had three more ranks to
305080	311520	go before I hit Commander and damn it, I'm almost there because I want that extra pip.
311520	317920	Other than that, I also canned two of my crewmen and now have this weird purple dude or purple
317920	324160	chick who just is bizarre looking, but she's got good stats or whatever.
324160	328800	And I have to say the crystalline entity is a bitch.
328800	329800	What is that?
329800	330800	Okay.
330800	331800	What is the crystal?
331800	332800	I don't.
332800	333800	I'm not a big enough nerd.
333800	334800	It was a next generation foe.
334800	335860	Okay.
335860	341440	And it's this big crystal thing, spiky crystal thing floating in space.
341440	343280	And in the show, they use a high pitched noisy.
343280	345240	Did they inject the warp core to fix it?
345240	346240	No.
346240	347240	Because that's always how you fix the problem.
347240	348240	You inject the warp core.
348240	349240	They pretty much screamed at it.
349240	350240	Oh, okay.
350240	351240	Pretty much screamed at it.
351240	353320	They used a high pitch harmonic or something.
353320	358240	So you're saying that the purple chick is a butter face.
358240	360880	She looks strange, but she has good stats.
360880	362040	Okay.
362040	363680	She has a nice body butter face.
363680	365400	Is that what it is?
365400	366400	Yes.
366400	367400	Okay.
367400	368400	Whatever.
368400	369400	Anyway.
369400	371760	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
371760	372760	Do we find a picture?
372760	373760	No.
373760	377000	Uh, I want to ask you something Star Trek related.
377000	378560	Have you heard the commercials on the radio?
378560	383280	There is the Star Trek tour is apparently like right around the corner from my house.
383280	384280	Yes.
384280	385280	And McClellan.
385280	386280	Yeah.
386280	388280	That's not giving away where I live on the show, but that's right around the corner of
388280	389280	my house.
389280	390280	Yeah.
390280	391280	It's like one exit up the freeway.
391280	392280	Oh, I didn't know.
392280	393280	Yes.
393280	394280	Oh, I know.
394280	395280	Sorry.
395280	396280	Well, now you know.
396280	397280	And now the entire internet knows where I live.
397280	398280	Send us cards and letters.
398280	399280	I thought you lived in the butt end the other way.
399280	400280	No.
400280	401440	Dan's in the other room singing, knowing it's half the battle.
401440	403020	We need to get Dan a mic in the living room.
403020	406920	We need to get like a, we need to get like a really long cord just so Dan can give his
406920	411280	MST 3k commentary during the show for the living room.
411280	412280	Anyway.
412280	414780	Well, why, how have you not gone yet?
414780	417520	Are we going, are we going to have a date?
417520	419840	I'm going to take you on a date to the Star Trek tour.
419840	422120	Are you going to give me dinner and flowers?
422120	424560	Um, sure.
424560	427280	I'll go steal some flowers from the apartment complex.
427280	432320	I picked them in the front and then, uh, you know, by, by dinner and flowers, um, he's
432320	436360	going to get me that Saturn game where you raise plants and a burger time and then we'll
436360	438640	have some fava beans and a nice can team.
438640	446520	Anyway, um, but what I was thinking about the crystal and this is, this is an open letter
446520	451160	of annoyance to people who play Star Trek online.
451160	454120	First of all, the crystalline entity thing is an open instance.
454120	456180	That means anyone can join it.
456180	461660	Even the most retarded of the retarded, the buttharted can join this instance.
461660	464400	Do not use mines.
464400	465400	Do not use mines.
465400	468800	The way that you beat the stupid thing is you eject the warp core breach.
468800	471200	That's how you kill it.
471200	474320	The way that you kill the thing is that when you get it down to 30% it's going to shoot
474320	476400	out these large crystals.
476400	480200	Don't shoot the fragments, shoot the big crystals because the big crystals go back and regenerate
480200	482720	the damn thing and then it shoots out everything and kills you.
482720	484320	We can't do it, captain.
484320	487800	We don't have the power.
487800	490540	Just people think strategy, please.
490540	492760	Does anybody ever yell that in Star Trek online?
492760	494640	We don't have the power.
494640	495640	No.
495640	498560	I'm sure somewhere somebody has.
498560	501720	They keep mentioning Worf.
501720	505640	And I actually enjoy all the instances that involve the Klingons because they're so much
505640	507640	fun.
507640	509480	I'm really enjoying the game, okay?
509480	512360	And Rob, you were supposed to play with me.
512360	513720	I will use the pass.
513720	514720	I will.
514720	517120	Let's just, you know, World of Warcraft addict, et cetera.
517120	518120	Okay, look.
518120	519120	I'm looking in our chat room.
519120	520600	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
520600	525000	And SSJ100Matt is saying that Tigerclaw has already found my house, apparently.
525000	526000	Oh, no.
526000	527000	Loki's house.
527000	528000	What was it?
528000	529000	I don't know.
529000	530600	Well, because Tigerclaw is the expert in our chat room.
530600	533600	Like, if we mention something, he'll have a link in five seconds.
533600	534600	He's amazing.
534600	537480	His Google flu is unmatched.
537480	538480	Let's see.
538480	542120	SSJ100Matt also commenting on the date between Dark Soccer and myself.
542120	544120	Rob better put out.
544120	546120	Yeah, Rob.
546120	547120	Yeah.
547120	550080	Put out the credit card to pay the bill.
550080	551080	That's what I'll be putting out.
551080	552080	That's right.
552080	553080	All right.
553080	554080	Let's see.
554080	555080	And then, where was there?
555080	556080	There was another one I wanted to say.
556080	557080	Oh, yes.
557080	560080	BobbyBlackWolf, our old pal buddy friend who does the show before us here at All Games
560080	561080	Radio.
561080	562080	He is hatin' on split second.
562080	565200	Like, if you listen to his show tonight, it's just an hour of split second bashing.
565200	567440	Not really, but it might as well have been.
567440	572720	He says in his gaming week, he ejected the warp core breach that is split second, because
572720	574320	he is not a fan, apparently, of split second.
574320	578240	I have not played split second outside the demo, but maybe next week I'll have more of
578240	583440	an opinion, and I'll either eject Bobby's opinion from the warp core or whatever.
583440	584440	I don't know.
584440	585440	We'll see.
585440	589120	Well, I also have to say the thing that Dan's been playing, because I have totally just
589120	590660	gotten a kick out of watching him play it.
590660	593120	We don't have the other controller hooked up where I'd play it, because you can play
593120	597880	simultaneous on it, is Super Mario Brothers X.
597880	602360	Speaking of pals from All Games Radio, I noticed Derek H. from Dead Pixel Live is in our chat
602360	605440	room, and if you don't listen to Dead Pixel Live, you're an idiot.
605440	609800	It's on Monday through Thursday at All Games Radio, so they do lots of shows.
609800	612140	And he's asking a good question I want to pose to Jamie.
612140	615020	Is Star Trek Online anything like you're in the show?
615020	620200	I did tell him that it's pretty episode-like and that I love it, but I will give a little
620200	622240	bit more of an apt description.
622240	623240	Okay.
623240	629660	You have, you basically talk to your commanders, you can talk to them, be a subspace, and you
629660	630980	get your missions.
630980	636520	So you go to whatever system, sometimes it's just a patrol, sometimes you think you're
636520	641640	going to some abandoned place to look on some research that you don't know why it killed
641640	644840	everybody, and oh, the Romulans are there.
644840	648080	Which is everything I was doing today.
648080	654820	Sometimes you go, actually we had a Section 31 guy pull like a big double switch.
654820	658080	I don't want to go into detail in case you play the game, because honestly the whole
658080	664640	thing with this game for me is that it really is like, I look forward to the story.
664640	668960	Every mission that you go through through the game forwards the story.
668960	672760	And you know, they do new episodes with new missions and everything, and I think that
672760	678520	that's pretty sweet, but really it's like you're playing through seasons of the show.
678520	679520	For me, that is.
679520	684960	I mean, and yeah, there's times where I'll scream at the stupid, you know, the Romulan,
684960	688480	the Romulan medics are the worst because like, shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate, shoot, shoot,
688480	690360	shoot, regenerate, shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate.
690360	696680	But they really do, you know, pay a lot of attention to canon in this too.
696680	699520	Like now, I've been reading the books.
699520	702040	Keep in mind, this is a different universe than the books.
702040	705600	The books were written before the new movie came out, and this is incorporating the new
705600	710040	movie into the storyline, so basically Romulus go boom.
710040	716000	Morph gets pissed off at everybody, pissed off.
716000	721280	It really is like a good continuation, but it says something like 20 years later, so
721280	724720	like you actually run into people who were children in the series.
724720	730120	Like you run into Maral Paris, and you run into Kiriyoshi O'Brien, and it's really neat.
730120	733080	I mean, it really is like being in the universe.
733080	735560	Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.
735560	736680	No, it's cool.
736680	737680	It's cool.
737680	739040	I do want to play a little more.
739040	744200	I only played during the beta, and I wasn't totally absorbed with it, so it was the space
744200	745360	combat turned me off.
745360	749280	I liked the away team mode, but I didn't like the space combat at all.
749280	753080	Actually, Rob, they've really, really addressed a lot of problems with space combat.
753080	754080	Okay, cool.
754080	755080	It's a lot smoother now.
755080	759400	But the other thing too is that once you get a little bit more used to the controls, it
759400	761200	actually is really fluid.
761200	764200	Now, you and I may have had the same problem.
764200	766400	My graphics card was crap.
766400	771520	I fixed that though, and now I can run wow at like highest settings, and it's purty.
771520	773520	Well, then you should have no problem.
773520	777960	When I upgraded my graphics card, a lot of my problems with control stopped because I
777960	778960	wasn't lagging.
778960	779960	Okay, cool.
779960	784040	Because it would literally, now the difference between graphics card lag is that it would
784040	786360	be stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter.
786360	790680	And internet lag is that you'll go forward, you'll row back a few steps, and you'll go
790680	792440	forward again.
792440	795600	But that's very few and far between.
795600	799680	It's just a little lag, and it looks like you've gone back like a millimeter on the
799680	800680	screen.
800680	803960	Wow lag can suck when it's like seconds and seconds of lag.
803960	804960	Freeze, freeze, freeze.
804960	808840	Yeah, just everything kind of freezes in place, and then everything happens in like half a
808840	809840	second.
809840	810840	I hate it.
810840	811840	Oh, it was bad.
811840	815360	I mean, usually the game doesn't get too laggy, but when you get those lag spikes, oh man,
815360	816360	world of hurt.
816360	817360	No, I hated it.
817360	819160	I mean, that was one of the reasons.
819160	823200	I like the lag in Star Trek Online a lot better than the lag in World of Warcraft.
823200	825920	In fact, I actually don't like World of Warcraft, so that helps.
825920	826920	Well, I tried.
826920	827920	Nine, eight.
827920	829800	I got a character to 20, Rob.
829800	830800	I know.
830800	831800	I got one to 20.
831800	832800	I know.
832800	841080	So yeah, if anyone wants to play with me, just saying, my whole account name is DarkSakura.
841080	846600	My character's name is Edarn, E-D-A-R-Y-N.
846600	851180	So yeah, I'm playing a Trill, whatever, because Trills are cool.
851180	854360	And so, yeah, we need a fleet, we need the O.L. Army fleet.
854360	855360	So there you go.
855360	856880	You can stalk DarkSakura on Star Trek Online.
856880	857880	Yeah.
857880	860200	I am right now hanging out in Romulan space.
860200	864880	Anyway, what I was going to say about Super Mario Bros. X.
864880	865880	Yes.
865880	866880	It's a Flash game.
866880	874120	You go to SuperMarioBrothers.org, and you know, I'll spell it out all over the word.
874120	875680	Not B-R-O-S, not Bros.
875680	876680	No, not Bros.
876680	878840	You have to do the full brothers.
878840	880560	Brothers, yeah.
880560	883160	But you can download the Flash game.
883160	886440	Dan's actually running it through our computer that's hooked up to our TV, so he plays it
886440	889600	at 52 inch widescreen.
889600	894880	But it's basically a rehashing of the Mario levels and things done in different, like
894880	899560	I love the first game on the list, it's called the Princess Cliche.
899560	904480	But it's basically this guy's made different, you know, Mario, Super Mario games that'll
904480	909360	have elements from Super Mario World, Super Mario 3s, even the flurries from Super Mario
909360	910840	2 are in the level.
910840	914520	I thought it was a very good looking game, I mean, it just looked like Super Mario World.
914520	917720	At least the little bit I saw, I didn't, you know, Dan tried to show it to me in about
917720	920600	10 seconds, like, you gotta check this out, but I...
920600	923480	He was playing levels last night that are really reminiscent of Super Mario 3.
923480	926800	Well the part that made me go, oh neat, is that it was two players simultaneous.
926800	927800	Yeah.
927800	929360	Kind of like the new Wii game is all simultaneous.
929360	930360	Yeah.
930360	935120	Well, we and I haven't played it together yet, but I have to say that it's, dude who
935120	936880	made that game, well done.
936880	938440	Very much well done.
938440	941960	Enjoy it while it lasts before Nintendo sues the pants off those people, although there
941960	946520	is a big splash screen that's basically the equivalent of please don't sue me, I love
946520	947520	Nintendo.
947520	948520	They've been around for a while though.
948520	949520	Has it?
949520	950520	Yeah, it's been around for a while.
950520	952240	Yeah, well, like, the game on, one of the games he has on there is like the first one
952240	958040	he ever did, which is really annoying because all you ever get is mushrooms in it, but it's,
958040	961280	it's really, it's really, he did a great job, like there's this one level that Dan was going
961280	967440	through where you have to, you get the buzzy beetle shells and you have to break purple
967440	970240	blocks with them so you have to get to the purple blocks and everything to unlock a door
970240	975760	and it really, it's got some definitely creative elements in it, I'm, I'm pretty, I think it's
975760	980240	pretty cool when I have some time that I'm not feeling like, you know, crap, I'll play
980240	981240	it.
981240	982240	Alright.
982240	984680	Well, let's move on with our gaming weeks.
984680	987440	We're almost 20 minutes, and Darsaki, you played a lot tonight, actually most of that
987440	988440	was Star Trek Babble.
988440	989440	That's okay.
989440	990440	I also still had to do a plug.
990440	991440	Oh, yes.
991440	992440	Well, let's do it during housekeeping.
992440	993440	Okay.
993440	994760	Because I, there, I do want to give that plug as well.
994760	997480	Uh, Loki, what did you, oh, you're, you're chowing down over there.
997480	998840	You ready to talk about gaming week?
998840	999840	Almost done eating.
999840	1000840	Alright.
1000840	1001840	Sorry.
1001840	1002840	Bad time.
1002840	1003840	You want me to go my gaming week then?
1003840	1004840	No, I'm ready.
1004840	1005840	Okay.
1005840	1006840	Okay.
1006840	1012000	So this week I played really only three things, um, Red Dead Redemption, played a lot more
1012000	1019880	system link co-op and the game is surprisingly, I don't know how to really put it, the system
1019880	1025640	link games, we have trouble staying in the same game, like it will have trouble joining
1025640	1026640	a system link game.
1026640	1029880	I have never seen a game that has trouble joining a system link game.
1029880	1032640	And the system link game means your Xbox are connected.
1032640	1033800	You're not even on the internet.
1033800	1038920	You are literally connected table to table and it's just like, can't find the other Xbox.
1038920	1041360	It's like, oh, you're in your own game and I have to find a new game.
1041360	1042880	Oh, you're in your own game again.
1042880	1043880	Find new game up.
1043880	1044880	There he is.
1044880	1048840	And we're like, we know we finished the mission or whatever co-op mission is split us off
1048840	1050040	into two different games again.
1050040	1053020	I'm like, what the hell is wrong with this thing?
1053020	1054960	But yeah, it's very buggy.
1054960	1062600	Um, we had issues with, um, where we were playing and we got dynamite and the molotovs
1062600	1063840	and stuff like that.
1063840	1072280	And it stopped showing us the explosions and the blood splurts and also the fire.
1072280	1076800	And then my friend had trouble going through a gate because on our screen, the gate was
1076800	1077800	open.
1077800	1080000	On our screen, the gate was shut and locked.
1080000	1083600	So it was interesting.
1083600	1086720	But um, yeah, it's, it's still really fun.
1086720	1092520	Um, I haven't gotten to play a lot of online cause trying to join games online, at least
1092520	1095480	at our work where connection's not so great.
1095480	1097880	Um, it's near impossible to do it.
1097880	1103120	So we just basically stick to System Link games cause at least that way if live drops,
1103120	1109160	which it does all the time on our, um, connection there at work, it doesn't matter.
1109160	1111420	So that's kind of fun.
1111420	1118960	And then also this week I went and played, um, some Grand Theft Auto, lost, er, not lost
1118960	1122920	in damn, but, uh, Battle of the Gay Tony, more of the Episodes of Liberty City stuff.
1122920	1124320	Um, still playing through that.
1124320	1128800	I'm actually still moving up the ranks cause I haven't lost a game in a few weeks.
1128800	1135920	Um, I'm 63 now, which is pretty cool, and really frustrating the hell out of my coworkers
1135920	1140800	cause they're getting pissed off now that I don't lose any games.
1140800	1145720	They're saying, because there was a guy that used to play with us named Chris Marsh and
1145720	1150300	they're saying he, what I'm doing is very Marshian because he would, you know, pull
1150300	1155680	off these just crazy ass, um, kills and stuff.
1155680	1162280	Like for example, in the old, um, PSP game, uh, Liberty City Stories, it was very glitched
1162280	1163280	out.
1163280	1166740	I mean we had problems with like teleporting grenades and whatever, um, but he actually
1166740	1168600	got one kill one time.
1168600	1171640	He actually got two kills out of one death.
1171640	1175880	It was just ridiculous because he killed somebody and somehow they had just driven over like
1175880	1179340	health or something and then they got a second death.
1179340	1182840	So he got two points for where he should have only gotten one.
1182840	1189880	I've actually gotten assists off of, um, what was it, assists off of my own death.
1189880	1195000	So I actually got points for me dying, which makes zero sense whatsoever cause you're not
1195000	1196280	supposed to be able to do that.
1196280	1200840	And it's not my fault, it's just the game is really glitchy and, you know, that's just
1200840	1202560	the way things are.
1202560	1207440	Speaking of glitchy games, I've gone back to Earth Defense Force 2017 and I am going
1207440	1208760	to beat it this time.
1208760	1216920	We actually, um, were playing some more and, uh, just going through the game and, uh, almost
1216920	1218140	finished with the game now.
1218140	1221320	So I will be finishing that game hopefully soon.
1221320	1224240	Kind of, uh, just had to dust it off again.
1224240	1228000	Actually cracked my copy, but thankfully a while back I bought the last three copies
1228000	1229840	we had for five dollars each.
1229840	1230840	Nice.
1230840	1232040	So I have spares.
1232040	1233260	Wow.
1233260	1235000	You should, I don't know, give one of those away as a prize.
1235000	1237920	I was playing on it some day, but I cracked the copy.
1237920	1238920	Endorsed by Loki edition.
1238920	1239920	It's awesome.
1239920	1240920	I bet the developers would love that.
1240920	1244920	Alright, uh, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
1244920	1248240	Um, that's pretty much it as far as stuff I've played.
1248240	1249960	I'm kind of working on something right now.
1249960	1254720	Well, I'm working on a lot of things cause that's just the way things work.
1254720	1261160	Um, working on painting the baby's room, which is game related because it's New Super Mario
1261160	1262420	Brothers themed.
1262420	1263420	That's gonna be cute.
1263420	1264920	You just need to put pictures on the, um, LR feed.
1264920	1266580	Oh yeah, there will be tons of pictures.
1266580	1267960	That's gonna be pimped out.
1267960	1271920	We got some of the wall decals, but we're gonna paint a lot of it, but we want the wall
1271920	1274000	decals for the characters and some of the other stuff.
1274000	1275320	You're doing Mario you said?
1275320	1277440	Yeah, New Super Mario Brothers theme.
1277440	1282840	I have a plan I can give you to make hampers look like the, um, the pipes.
1282840	1283840	Huh.
1283840	1285600	Well, I'll have to look at that.
1285600	1289160	Cause I was just gonna get giant PVC and make it into a pipe, but.
1289160	1292440	That was, well, it's something that I had planned cause that's what Dan and I were gonna
1292440	1293440	do.
1293440	1294440	Cool.
1294440	1296680	And then I got some other stuff from ThinkGeek.
1296680	1302520	Uh, like I got a, it was a open source, uh, music box.
1302520	1306280	So we have it so that you can make the Super Mario Brothers theme on that.
1306280	1308640	And then some Mario figurines.
1308640	1315520	And we're planning on doing some, um, uh, question block shelving and custom carpet
1315520	1319040	that's, or rug that's gonna have Mario Brothers stuff on it.
1319040	1321440	Really there is no Mario Brothers furniture out there.
1321440	1325320	But you would think, you know, with the popularity of Mario Brothers that there would be a ton
1325320	1326320	of stuff out there.
1326320	1327320	But it's not.
1327320	1332200	There's a lot of handmade stuff on eBay that's just super expensive and really ugly.
1332200	1337920	But um, yeah, a lot of it's just gonna be handmade and, uh, will be really awesome.
1337920	1341640	Of course there'll be tons of pictures for it once it does get finished.
1341640	1346200	Um, the other thing I'm working on right now, and this is just kind of an on a whim thing,
1346200	1352480	uh, that I decided to do the other day is what, cause I love the, uh, phrasing project
1352480	1356800	$10 that EA has been using, you know, cause they're charging people lots of money for
1356800	1358960	stuff that should be in the games in the first place.
1358960	1366920	Um, but I decided to come up with project under $100 and what project under $100 is,
1366920	1373400	is building a working main cabinet under $100.
1373400	1376440	And that's including everything, including shipping.
1376440	1379800	Now, although I'm pricing stuff out now, I don't know if I can include shipping in there
1379800	1385320	cause it's, I want to do a two player cocktail, but, um, it might be a little difficult.
1385320	1391240	But basically though, um, you know, involving, uh, actually getting like an LCD monitor,
1391240	1396120	computer, uh, all the arcade parts and that kind of stuff under $100.
1396120	1397600	It might end up being $120.
1397600	1398600	We'll see.
1398600	1401440	Uh, after all that stuff, cause like I said, I don't want the extra buttons and joystick
1401440	1402440	and stuff.
1402440	1406360	Uh, so far I have the computer and the monitor for under $70.
1406360	1409000	So I'm off to a good start.
1409000	1414120	And um, the cabinet itself will be funny because it will be made out of cardboard.
1414120	1415120	Nice.
1415120	1419080	Thanks to the US postal service because you can get a ton of boxes from them for absolutely
1419080	1420920	free and they ship them to you.
1420920	1421920	Wow.
1421920	1423400	That's kind of cool.
1423400	1424400	Very cool.
1424400	1426700	Uh, comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

1438500	1443140	Some comments from chat, ssj100matt, uh, talking about the baby room says diapers go in the
1443140	1445660	chomp chomp bin.
1445660	1446660	Get it?
1446660	1447660	Cause yeah.
1447660	1448660	Yeah.
1448660	1449660	Yeah.
1449660	1450660	All right.
1450660	1451720	Uh, Derek H says, uh, if he does that, I'm assuming talking about the main cabinet, I'm
1451720	1452720	doing it.
1452720	1455840	My main cabinet is an old laptop, a monitor and an Xbox 360 controller.
1455840	1456840	Yeah.
1456840	1457840	Great.
1457840	1458840	I mean, I could have done a lot of stuff.
1458840	1459840	Hey, I've got some spare parts.
1459840	1464560	I know this doesn't cost me anything, but I wanted it so that it can be somewhat reproducible
1464560	1468720	because the problem is though, like shopping on eBay and buying new stuff, you never know
1468720	1472320	what you're going to get for what price and I mean, you know, ideally you get one day
1472320	1473320	is not a deal.
1473320	1474400	You're gonna get another day.
1474400	1476560	So I got lucky with some of that stuff.
1476560	1481860	Like I said, I got a monitor for $32 an LCD monitor, 15 inch LCD monitor that has one
1481860	1483500	dead pixel, but I don't give a shit.
1483500	1486440	It's you know, going in a cardboard cabinets, who cares?
1486440	1494400	Um, and I got a computer for $35 that's basically, uh, it's a 1.6 gigahertz processor, which
1494400	1499480	is fine for MAME and I think a half gig of Ram, which is perfect for MAME.
1499480	1503240	It's not going to be able to run anything really great, but it's just for MAME.
1503240	1505560	That's all it really is going to be used for.
1505560	1511660	Um, and then the cabinet itself, I'm kind of wondering, cause I'm not sure if I can
1511660	1518800	do all of those boxes from the US Postal Service, uh, because they're only about a foot high
1518800	1522560	and if I want like a cocktail cabinet, it's gotta be a few feet tall.
1522560	1526640	So I may have to supplement it with some other stuff, but, um, I'm just kind of throwing
1526640	1527640	around the idea.
1527640	1534640	We got like this gift card from work for ironically enough selling split second and, um, so I'm
1534640	1536100	using it for that.
1536100	1540480	I bet Bobby would be proud to know that you got rewarded for selling extra copies of split
1540480	1542440	second to people.
1542440	1543440	Good job, Loki.
1543440	1545000	It's a, it's a decent game.
1545000	1547560	I mean, you know, I don't know.
1547560	1548560	All right.
1548560	1549560	Uh, anything else?
1549560	1550560	Loki.
1550560	1551560	That's it.
1551560	1552560	All right.
1552560	1553560	Let me get into, uh, my gaming week.
1553560	1554560	Cause I, it was pretty busy.
1554560	1555560	You know, we haven't been live the past two weeks.
1555560	1560080	This is our first show live in, I guess what, three weeks then because we had two shows
1560080	1561080	off.
1561080	1565720	We had the show not planned to be off where my car broke down and I wasn't here in time,
1565720	1567400	but we did have the podcast feed.
1567400	1570560	So if you haven't heard episode three 68, we taped it later in the week, like a few
1570560	1571780	days later, it went to the podcast feed.
1571780	1574720	We couldn't do a live cause there's other all game shows on during the week, but we,
1574720	1576400	we taped something and put it to the feet.
1576400	1578680	Uh, and the Memorial day, we'd always plan to take off.
1578680	1581800	Well, Memorial day, the reason why we were off, some of us are going on vacation.
1581800	1586120	Uh, Alan and I went up to Portland and had a really good time, but what I wanted to share
1586120	1589720	with you guys was this awesome place we found in downtown Portland.
1589720	1590720	We had no idea this was there.
1590720	1592100	I wasn't even looking for it.
1592100	1593100	Just came across it.
1593100	1597640	I saw a giant sign with the space invaders on it that said barcade.
1597640	1598720	And I'm like, no way.
1598720	1600000	It's like a bar in an arcade.
1600000	1602880	And one of our friends that was with us was like, yeah, they have like old games there
1602880	1605960	and you and I'm like, okay, we're going, we're going, let's go.
1605960	1609080	It's classic arcade games and beer.
1609080	1610360	And that's exactly what this place is.
1610360	1615760	This place called ground control with a K. And I guess actually one thing I didn't realize
1615760	1620400	it's one of those arcades that's also participating in the save the arcades to campaign.
1620400	1624040	Uh, we had a story on that a couple of weeks ago because arcade infinity is also competing
1624040	1625040	with this place.
1625040	1627480	Well, I got to tell you, this place was awesome.
1627480	1632560	I had a good time and, uh, you know, I, I didn't try to talk to anybody or I wasn't
1632560	1636320	like, you know, I'm from Warren's Laundry, you know, I just, I went in as a, as a patron
1636320	1639660	and I had a really good time just playing some of the classic games and that's really
1639660	1640660	what this place was.
1640660	1642740	It was full of classic games.
1642740	1644120	I played burger time.
1644120	1645520	I played Qbert.
1645520	1648080	I played, uh, Marvel versus Capcom.
1648080	1652640	I played pinball, like the upstairs was just pinball, pinball, and more pinball.
1652640	1656920	I was like, I think I had to, I sent a message to Jamie on Twitter or a text or something.
1656920	1660160	I was like, Jamie, you have to come here like right now.
1660160	1661360	Here's pinball everywhere.
1661360	1665800	I played theater of magic, which is one of my favorite tables they ever did.
1665800	1668240	And uh, Arabian nights, which is awesome.
1668240	1671240	That's the one with the giant genie lamp in the middle that spins around when you hit
1671240	1672240	it.
1672240	1673240	Awesome.
1673240	1674520	I don't remember seeing it.
1674520	1675520	They had a lot.
1675520	1679040	They had more pinball machines than I've ever seen in an arcade at a lot.
1679040	1681160	But there were like, somebody asked me if they had space jam.
1681160	1682160	I didn't see space jam.
1682160	1683160	I did see Dr. Who.
1683160	1684600	That made me think of you.
1684600	1687440	They had a Dr. Who table, so that was pretty cool.
1687440	1691380	The only complaint I have about the place is that the game, the games are packed in
1691380	1694920	so tight because the real estate there, there's not a lot of it.
1694920	1698880	There's a lot of like brushing up against strangers and not a lot of elbow room.
1698880	1701960	I got to say, I was there on a, was I there Friday or Saturday?
1701960	1702960	No, we drove in Friday.
1702960	1704360	So it was there Saturday night.
1704360	1706080	It was pretty hopping.
1706080	1710560	Like you would think this is kind of a niche thing, but just add booze, you guys.
1710560	1713480	They have beers on tap and they were, they were a hopping place.
1713480	1715480	There were quite a few people in there.
1715480	1716480	Yeah.
1716480	1719520	I mean, it's, it's kind of like Dave and Buster's for those of us that are into classic games.
1719520	1720880	So I endorse this place.
1720880	1723160	If you're in the Pacific Northwest, you need to check this place out.
1723160	1724160	It's ground control.
1724160	1725160	It's a lot of fun.
1725160	1728520	Um, they do all sorts of theme nights, uh, apparently throughout the month too.
1728520	1731240	And they have bands that, that perform there and everything.
1731240	1733540	So I, yeah, I had a good time.
1733540	1734540	So I'm surprised.
1734540	1739200	And one thing, and Alan said the same thing, and I commented on this too, is that why in
1739200	1741040	the hell don't they have this in San Francisco?
1741040	1743800	Like there's nothing like it in San Francisco.
1743800	1748360	And you would think of all places, kind of tech central, you know, NorCal would have
1748360	1750200	something like it, but sadly it does not.
1750200	1753920	Uh, SJ100Matt says that there is a barcade in New York City, Brooklyn to be exact.
1753920	1758040	You know, I think I'd heard about that, uh, but I had not been there.
1758040	1761520	Um, Bond006 in chat says, did you have a geek moment?
1761520	1764560	Yes, I did have a geek moment when I went in there and squeed.
1764560	1768240	And I watched my friend, get this guys, I know a long time OLR fans will appreciate
1768240	1772960	this, they had a DDR Extreme machine that I watched my friend play for only 50 cents.
1772960	1773960	Good times.
1773960	1774960	And no tokens.
1774960	1776600	They, that was another refreshing theme.
1776600	1780200	Everything actually ran on quarters and they had to have signs on the machines that say
1780200	1782580	don't use this for your laundry, buddy.
1782580	1783740	That's old school.
1783740	1784740	Good times.
1784740	1789760	So yes, uh, A++ for ground control and I hope there's more places that spring up like it.
1789760	1793640	Um, as far as other games that I've played that you don't have to be in Portland in order
1793640	1798320	to, um, access, I did play a couple of new games since I was in Oregon.
1798320	1802540	Oregon is infamous for not having sales tax, at least to those of us in California.
1802540	1803840	So I loaded up on games.
1803840	1805320	I bought four new games this week.
1805320	1809360	I bought Blur, Split Second, Red Dead Redemption and Alan Wake.
1809360	1813560	I bought all of those games so that I could save a little bit on sales tax cause I'm cheap.
1813560	1815440	Although I bought four new video games.
1815440	1816440	It wasn't that cheap.
1816440	1820240	Uh, I played two of them this week cause I didn't have time to do everything and I was
1820240	1821240	kind of focusing.
1821240	1824680	I probably played Blur more than any other game that I got this week.
1824680	1827120	Um, and Blur is pretty cool.
1827120	1830380	It is exactly what they are marketing it as in the commercials.
1830380	1832800	It is Mario Kart meets Burnout.
1832800	1838000	It is, you know, Mario Kart for grownups, um, but it's, you know, obviously there's
1838000	1840120	something to be said about the cute factor of Mario Kart.
1840120	1843720	I don't think that Mario Kart is simply just a kid's game, but if you ever thought, gee,
1843720	1847720	I'd like to play like old school Burnout, but with powerups, that is exactly why they
1847720	1848720	made Blur.
1848720	1850540	That's, that's the simplest way I could describe it.
1850540	1851800	It's Burnout with powerups.
1851800	1853240	Um, and it's a lot of fun.
1853240	1855880	I think online especially has done very well.
1855880	1860600	Um, I, I, it's very easy to find a game, join it, you get to vote on the track you want
1860600	1861600	to do.
1861600	1864880	It's kind of very easy to just get in there and play and have some fun online.
1864880	1869160	There are noob only rooms that are restricted to those that are level 10 and under and I
1869160	1872240	thought that was good so that you can play with people that are new to the game.
1872240	1875960	I was actually able to win a game because of that, which shocked the hell out of me
1875960	1879200	because I never win games on Xbox Live because you're always against some expert.
1879200	1882200	Um, so I, I, I had a lot of fun with Blur.
1882200	1886840	I do have some complaints about the game or things they could do better in the sequel
1886840	1890000	because I, I, I'm, I'm pretty sure there will be a Blur 2.
1890000	1893820	There deserves to be a Blur 2, um, and, uh, there are some things I would like to see
1893820	1895440	them do better in the sequel.
1895440	1898120	First off, my number one complaint about the game.
1898120	1899360	The soundtrack blows.
1899360	1904920	Um, it's non-existent in some parts and I don't really know like what the music score
1904920	1905920	is.
1905920	1910760	In some parts, like there's a movie in the beginning that kind of had a cool song I recognized
1910760	1916120	in it that was neat and, and in the opening menus, there's some cool techno songs, but
1916120	1922920	you would think something with that look of Blur, like the neon, the kind of like F-Zero
1922920	1927680	but not in the future look that Blur sort of has the burnout meets F-Zero look, uh,
1927680	1931320	you would think has some type of like techno thumping soundtrack to it, right?
1931320	1932960	Or something like that's what burnout had.
1932960	1937440	The burnout tracks, EA tracks, I mean, granted Blur is by Activision, but you would still
1937440	1940600	expect there to be somewhat of a soundtrack, but it, it wasn't there.
1940600	1942360	It wasn't notable for me.
1942360	1945320	And from what I understand, you know, they had this agreement apparently signed where
1945320	1947660	I guess Crystal Method produced a soundtrack.
1947660	1950480	I was just expecting something a lot more.
1950480	1955240	Um, I was tempted just to really use custom soundtracks the whole time.
1955240	1959160	I was very disappointed in, in what should have been a better soundtrack.
1959160	1964600	My other complaint is, believe it or not, the graphics are not awesome.
1964600	1966040	You know, like they're, they're good.
1966040	1967720	They're definitely next gen.
1967720	1970040	They're a step above what you're going to see on the Wii.
1970040	1976000	But I wasn't like blown away by the graphics, like, yeah, Blur has this neon thing going
1976000	1982480	for it, but that neon is often mixed in many stages with Highway 50 going through Nevada,
1982480	1988160	like that very brown, blonde, dusty kind of theme, which I don't know what they were trying
1988160	1991920	to go for with it, but it, it didn't make the graphics look that notable.
1991920	1997760	Honestly, the graphics were kind of comparable to Fuel, which didn't really have A++ graphics
1997760	1998760	either.
1998760	2000760	So I was a little bit disappointed.
2000760	2005960	But in the end, graphics and sound are not the only important things in a video game,
2005960	2010800	and the game itself is still a lot of fun, and I am having fun making my way through
2010800	2011800	it.
2011800	2012920	I am deserving of a sequel.
2012920	2015880	I hope they just put a little more polish on it next time.
2015880	2019040	That is what I would hope for.
2019040	2022880	Comments from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
2022880	2028480	Bond006 says, has anyone seen the underhand slap at Ninty, Nintendo, in the Blur ad at
2028480	2029480	the end?
2029480	2032280	Oh yeah, I think the Blur ad is great, and it's really perfect for what Blur is trying
2032280	2033280	to be.
2033280	2034280	Awesome.
2034280	2036980	Deathwishing says, the graphics are better than Fuel.
2036980	2039880	Trust me, I loved Fuel.
2039880	2040880	I liked Fuel a lot too.
2040880	2043640	I thought Fuel was severely underrated.
2043640	2048400	But Fuel was also, the biggest problem with Fuel is that it was too ambitious, and there
2048400	2053240	wasn't enough polish because the world was too big in Fuel.
2053240	2054760	That was its biggest problem.
2054760	2056840	Its ambition was its own worst enemy.
2056840	2060500	And to some extent, maybe that was the biggest problem with Blur is that they spent so much
2060500	2065320	time on the game itself, which is where you should spend the time, don't get me wrong.
2065320	2069300	I think some of the graphics and sound I think suffered a little bit.
2069300	2071600	But let me say this too, because this is important.
2071600	2074800	One feature that's in Blur that I think a lot of people overlook, that does make it
2074800	2081760	pretty awesome, and may explain why the graphics take a hit, it does have split screen multiplayer.
2081760	2085220	So you don't just have to play this game on Xbox Live.
2085220	2089200	You can play, like Mario Kart, two people on one screen.
2089200	2091520	So that's kind of cool.
2091520	2095040	So, you know, take it with a grain of salt, I suppose.
2095040	2098160	Maybe that's why they had to make some concessions with the graphics and sound.
2098160	2102560	The other game I played this week, Red Dead Redemption, which might surprise some of you
2102560	2103560	guys who listen to this show.
2103560	2107720	It's not usually the type of game I would play, but the reviews on it have been so stellar,
2107720	2110640	and I've read such good things on it, I'm like, I have to pick this up and know what
2110640	2111640	I'm missing.
2111640	2116480	I'm gonna be honest, I haven't played a whole lot of this story, because I can't stop shooting
2116480	2117940	random people.
2117940	2122240	That's right, the minute they gave me a gun, I just walk up to random townspeople and shoot
2122240	2123240	them.
2123240	2124840	And I'm trying to find out all the different ways to kill them.
2124840	2128560	Like, you can shoot them in the face, or run up to them and shoot them in the stomach,
2128560	2130480	and I laugh maniacally every time to the point...
2130480	2132640	You need to get the lasso.
2132640	2134560	That's what I'm hearing, everybody tells me that.
2134560	2136520	Once you get the lasso...
2136520	2139200	Dan just said the same damn thing when I walked in there.
2139200	2140200	It's just...
2140200	2143480	Okay, my sister came over, she's been playing Red Dead Redemption as well, because I got
2143480	2149840	her a copy, and she just comes over and just can't stop laughing at what she's been doing.
2149840	2155080	She says one of the things she likes doing is lassoing a coyote and dragging it into
2155080	2161280	the middle of town, and then letting it go, because it will attack whatever it sees.
2161280	2162280	That's pretty funny.
2162280	2165800	And then you can tie people up, throw them on the train tracks, you can tie people up
2165800	2168760	and push them off a hill.
2168760	2173600	My favorite is calling my horse over while I'm standing next to a cliff and it just dives
2173600	2176680	off the cliff, because it's just stupid.
2176680	2180240	Honestly, here it is with Red Dead Redemption.
2180240	2182080	It's sandbox gaming at its finest.
2182080	2183080	It really is.
2183080	2185800	If you've ever wanted one of that Wild West sandbox...
2185800	2186800	Grand Theft Horse.
2186800	2187800	There you go.
2187800	2188800	Grand Theft...
2188800	2189800	Well, it is.
2189800	2190800	It's the same engine.
2190800	2191800	It's that rock star engine...
2191800	2192800	Rage.
2192800	2193800	Yeah, Rage.
2193800	2194800	They're proprietary engines.
2194800	2195800	And they're euphoria.
2195800	2198840	Tigerclaw says, wow, sky is sadistic, very uncharacteristic of you.
2198840	2199840	Dude, I just...
2199840	2203240	I don't play these games an awful lot, but when I do, it's really funny.
2203240	2205120	I don't take it seriously.
2205120	2206740	You guys know how...
2206740	2209680	I know a lot of you guys must be kind of like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2209680	2212960	Isn't Rob the same guy who went off on the Saw movies and now he doesn't like them because
2212960	2213960	they're too violent?
2213960	2218860	Well, yeah, but Saw is kind of like realistic and like Red Dead Redemption, like the graphics
2218860	2221900	are good and all, but it's not realistic.
2221900	2222960	You know what I mean?
2222960	2223960	There's a difference.
2223960	2224960	There's a huge difference.
2224960	2226280	I can't explain it.
2226280	2229680	If it makes me a hypocrite, well, screw you.
2229680	2234360	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what would your mother say about this?
2234360	2236880	Rob, that's just gross, Rob.
2236880	2238240	My mom said we could call her by the way.
2238240	2239240	Really?
2239240	2240240	We're going to have to do that.
2240240	2241240	I don't know if we should do it tonight.
2241240	2242240	I'm going to say next week.
2242240	2243240	We should.
2243240	2244240	Yeah.
2244240	2245240	And if you...
2245240	2246240	Let's do it after E3 because I think the next two... because next week is the Microsoft
2246240	2251680	thing, but definitely in the near future, we will make that work.
2251680	2256080	Kitsune says, Red Dead Redemption feels so much more fun than Grand Theft Auto IV though.
2256080	2257980	You know, I kind of agree.
2257980	2259640	I don't know what it is, Kitsune.
2259640	2260960	I feel the same thing.
2260960	2266760	There's something about it where I don't know if it's just the environment or it's just
2266760	2272280	the story or I just get drawn into Red Dead Redemption a lot more and I do Grand Theft
2272280	2273280	Auto IV.
2273280	2274280	I don't know.
2274280	2279040	Deathwishing in chat says, Rob, I got mauled by 13 cougars at once.
2279040	2280040	That's awesome.
2280040	2281480	I was instantly thinking of...
2281480	2284180	I was instantly thinking of Courtney Cox in Cougar Town.
2284180	2285180	Is it just me?
2285180	2286180	Is it just me?
2286180	2288440	I was thinking of Blanche because you know she...
2288440	2289440	Blanche.
2289440	2290440	Ah, rest in peace, Blanche.
2290440	2291440	I know.
2291440	2292440	I know.
2292440	2293440	I miss those old broads.
2293440	2294440	All right.
2294440	2296640	But Betty White has outlasted them all.
2296640	2297640	That's right.
2297640	2298640	There can be only one.
2298640	2301080	And Betty White has proved she's the HBIC.
2301080	2302080	That's right.
2302080	2303080	Okay.
2303080	2304480	That's pretty much it for my gaming week.
2304480	2306160	We're literally 40 minutes into the show.
2306160	2307680	Haven't touched a damn bit of news.
2307680	2309720	So let me do some quick housekeeping, guys.
2309720	2312280	There's some new articles at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2312280	2317160	There's been some great, great retro reviews, retro rear views written in the past couple
2317160	2318160	of weeks.
2318160	2320520	It's been done by baseballs, got some gameplay.
2320520	2321840	There's a story on Metal Gear.
2321840	2327000	A new segment that's being done by ActDeft called Video Stumble, which is kind of neat.
2327000	2328000	So check that out, guys.
2328000	2331760	Our website is expanding with all this kind of retro-ish content, and I thought that was
2331760	2332760	really cool.
2332760	2334320	I also uploaded some pics from my Portland trip.
2334320	2338600	If you want to see the picture of the Burger Time machine and the OLR initials, I put those
2338600	2341400	up at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, so check those out.
2341400	2342400	I also want to give a plug.
2342400	2349200	Maybe I'll let Jamie plug this, but she wrote a great article on our friend website.
2349200	2352560	I don't want to say our sister website, but our BFF website.
2352560	2353560	We'll say that.
2353560	2356200	Our BFF at Geek-Life.com.
2356200	2358600	Tell them a little bit about what you did, DarkSucker.
2358600	2364560	Well, actually, I have a regular panel on there every week on Tuesday that's called
2364560	2372520	Geek Cube, talking about how to incorporate your geeky life with your work life.
2372520	2376760	But I also write other articles, like I did a review of this place called Fairy Tale Town
2376760	2378480	for little kids.
2378480	2386320	But I also did a write-up for OrangeLoungeRadio, since we get a nice big plug on the website.
2386320	2394160	So I just basically kind of did the not-so-secret origin of OrangeLoungeRadio.
2394160	2399120	Well, it was a historical type of thing, and kind of went through how we evolved from the
2399120	2403240	show that was on the living room floor about DDR and 2DX to the show we are today.
2403240	2404240	It was pretty cool.
2404240	2409240	I mean, and really, it's the question, you know, we get asked it fairly often, like,
2409240	2413480	how'd you come up with that name, and how'd you come up with this, and how long you been
2413480	2415840	doing this, and what was it like, and blah, blah, blah.
2415840	2420240	And there's a few of you who've been here since, you know, episode one, which I think
2420240	2424680	are all in this room, and two people in chat.
2424680	2433440	So but, you know, I really just wanted to go through and sort of give, you know, a little
2433440	2438280	origin story, you know, how we evolved, how we've gotten to where we are now.
2438280	2442800	By the way, I hear DarkSakura might not be the only OLR host writing something for Geek
2442800	2443800	Life.
2443800	2444800	Wahaha.
2444800	2445800	Uh-huh.
2445800	2446800	Uh-huh.
2446800	2447800	I'll give you a hint.
2447800	2448800	It's not me.
2448800	2456400	Well, just to go ahead and do the call-out, we are looking for people to contribute content.
2456400	2462080	Just basically go to geek-life.com, and we have a little link on there for submissions
2462080	2464800	so you can submit to our will.
2464800	2467240	Although I really need to be writing stuff for orangelawnsradio.com, too.
2467240	2468240	Yes, I do.
2468240	2469240	And we don't want to sadly neglect that.
2469240	2470240	Well, we can, we can.
2470240	2474360	But we've got great fan staff that's been doing a good job, so props to all of those
2474360	2475360	kids.
2475360	2483080	But yeah, keep a look out because, you know, and also you may see a few things cross-posted.
2483080	2484080	Very cool.
2484080	2487680	I'm actually going to have an interview up on the site next week, next week I hope.
2487680	2488680	Interview, interview.
2488680	2494480	With Jim McCann, who wrote New Avengers The Reunion and is writing the current Hawkeye
2494480	2500920	Mockingbird and the Dazzler one-shot that was fabulous.
2500920	2502920	Geek Life, indeed.
2502920	2507120	Well, and that, that and he's just a really, really cool person, so.
2507120	2508120	Sounds like fun.
2508120	2509120	All right.
2509120	2510120	Geek-life.com.
2510120	2511120	The dash is important.
2511120	2512760	What happens if they don't put the dash in?
2512760	2513760	Do they get porn?
2513760	2514760	Probably.
2514760	2515760	All right.
2515760	2516760	Let's see.
2516760	2517760	Geek is porn?
2517760	2518760	Could you imagine?
2518760	2519760	Oh, it's probably is there.
2519760	2521880	You know, actually, I don't know if you've noticed, but your ads on Geek Life, a lot
2521880	2523200	of them are for geek dating sites.
2523200	2524200	I don't know if you've noticed.
2524200	2525200	Yeah.
2525200	2526200	Yeah.
2526200	2527200	There you go.
2527200	2532320	So, and again, if you do click on ads, does, does, does it, does, does Maren get some kickback
2532320	2533320	for the click, ad clicking?
2533320	2536200	I think it's, yeah, I think it helps cover the site.
2536200	2537200	Just goes to pay for the site.
2537200	2539040	So, click on ads and have a good time.
2539040	2540040	All right.
2540040	2542160	Hey, I want to mention this too, because I got asked about this earlier tonight.
2542160	2546360	I don't have a lot to say on this yet, but we were asked, apparently All Games Radio
2546360	2549040	is putting together this thing called The Big Battle.
2549040	2550920	And I was asked if we are participating.
2550920	2554320	I literally found out about this today.
2554320	2559380	But from what I understand in a nutshell, it is a bunch of the shows at All Games Radio
2559380	2560380	kind of getting together.
2560380	2563400	And it's kind of one of those things that when you hear the idea, you're kind of like,
2563400	2565080	this should have been done like two years ago.
2565080	2566360	Like, how obvious is this?
2566360	2568760	And why haven't we done something like this a while ago?
2568760	2571160	But our props, I don't know who is spearheading this.
2571160	2572720	I think it might be Dead Pixel Live.
2572720	2573720	I don't know.
2573720	2576260	But props to them for putting it on.
2576260	2582040	It's going to kind of bring the All Games community together in big battles on games.
2582040	2586320	I can't 100% for sure confirm our participation yet, because I have to talk to Dark Soccer
2586320	2587320	on Loki after the show.
2587320	2588520	See what we can do.
2588520	2590640	But why wouldn't we?
2590640	2591640	I mean, really.
2591640	2594920	I mean, I'm all about like trying to promote the All Games Network and other shows.
2594920	2601040	And I think a lot of our greatest listeners has come from the cross kind of pollination
2601040	2602160	of the shows.
2602160	2607080	And I've always said, I realize Orange Lounge Radio is not for everybody.
2607080	2609560	There's some games we just don't really talk about here on the show.
2609560	2610560	Like Madden.
2610560	2612720	Actually, we have a Madden story tonight, funny enough.
2612720	2615320	Usually, we don't talk a lot about the sports games like Madden.
2615320	2616720	But there's other shows on the network.
2616720	2619160	They talk about that a lot.
2619160	2621080	And they probably would go, DDR?
2621080	2623240	What are those guys doing?
2623240	2628080	So if you don't like us, surely there's another show on the network that caters to your interest.
2628080	2629600	So I'm definitely all about that.
2629600	2631400	So sure, I'm sure we're going to participate.
2631400	2635280	It's just a matter of figuring out what games we will actually be able to play.
2635280	2640060	However, as I understand it, this is not just a host versus host thing.
2640060	2643520	This is a listener versus listener thing.
2643520	2650840	So we're going to need you, OL Army, to sign up and represent us in some of these games.
2650840	2654560	So I will hopefully have more details for you on that next week.
2654560	2659440	Again, I'm not confirming our participation, but I'm just saying, it's probably going to
2659440	2660440	happen.
2660440	2661440	All right.
2661440	2664240	Anyhow, hopefully I didn't say too much on that.
2664240	2667560	But somebody asked in chat earlier, and I think the All Games folks know what's going
2667560	2668560	on, so whatevs.
2668560	2671000	Also, the other thing I want to plug.
2671000	2673680	E3 is coming up next week.
2673680	2677280	Believe it or not, E3 is kind of starting on a Sunday this year.
2677280	2678280	I mean, not officially.
2678280	2680240	The show itself does not start on a Tuesday.
2680240	2685520	But while our show is going on, did you guys know, at I think about 8 o'clock Pacific,
2685520	2691920	I could have the time wrong, but that is Xbox, Microsoft's Project Natal Cirque du Soleil
2691920	2694280	show is a week from right now.
2694280	2696000	So we're actually going to be here.
2696000	2697520	We will be doing a show.
2697520	2701800	We may cut live to the press conference if we can get some coverage.
2701800	2703720	We will figure out how we can do that.
2703720	2706320	I don't know if it's going to be much besides a show.
2706320	2710000	I don't know what's all involved with that, but we will try to figure that out and bring
2710000	2711780	you that live next week.
2711780	2717320	Also here live next week, speaking of old school OLR, an old familiar guest of the show,
2717320	2720360	Miklotov, is going to be here because he's going to E3 with me.
2720360	2723640	So we don't leave till Monday night, so we will be here Sunday.
2723640	2726400	We are not going to miss any OLR because of E3.
2726400	2730120	In fact, there might be bonus OLR on the feed.
2730120	2736880	I wouldn't see why myself and Miklotov and maybe Loki and DarkSakura via phone, depending
2736880	2742160	on what we can do, or at least Bobby BlackWolf, I'm sure, if he's not too busy with all his
2742160	2746260	appointments, will do some little mini podcast that will go to the feed during E3.
2746260	2747260	So that'll be fun.
2747260	2752200	Loki, I know you'll be hitting refresh on the sites nonstop, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
2752200	2754480	Now here's what I'm going to be doing during the week.
2754480	2758760	And this is sad because I'm not very productive during E3.
2758760	2764040	I watch the live conferences at my desk.
2764040	2765040	Good times.
2765040	2768920	Or, yeah, I refresh on like four different live feeds at once.
2768920	2771800	I'd like to be able to stream it on my iPhone.
2771800	2774960	I might be able to.
2774960	2779000	Our internet's that crappy at work, so why not?
2779000	2781480	All right, lots of housekeeping.
2781480	2784080	Now we can finally get to gaming news.
2784080	2785080	Hey, hey, hey.
2785080	2786080	Gaming news.
2786080	2787080	Oh, yeah, on Facebook.
2787080	2788080	Facebook.
2788080	2789080	Add us on Facebook.
2789080	2790080	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2790080	2791560	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2791560	2792560	Have I named everything?
2792560	2793800	I think I have.
2793800	2796720	Let's get into the freaking show already.
2796720	2798680	Loki, what is going on in gaming news?
2798680	2803320	You know, I guess I could take time off during E3, too, because I do have a lot of time off.
2803320	2805640	You should have just gone to the, well, you got your wife and the baby.
2805640	2807360	She would not let me go to E3.
2807360	2809280	She's having nightmares about me going to E3.
2809280	2810280	I know, I know.
2810280	2813720	Not nightmares, but dreams of which she is mad at me afterwards.
2813720	2814720	I know.
2814720	2815720	Oh, well.
2815720	2816720	Maybe next year.
2816720	2817720	Yeah, next.
2817720	2818720	Well.
2818720	2819720	Maybe not.
2819720	2820720	Maybe in three years.
2820720	2821720	Never.
2821720	2822720	Yeah.
2822720	2826600	So anyways, there's a rumor going around that Harmonics is working on a dancing game for
2826600	2828240	Natal.
2828240	2835800	And this is becoming, I guess, obvious due to some licenses that they are acquiring for
2835800	2842280	different danceable tracks, including Cascada's Evacuate the Dance Floor, Timberland's The
2842280	2843280	Way I Are.
2843280	2844280	Wait a minute.
2844280	2846560	This came up a couple weeks ago, I think, some of these licensing things.
2846560	2848760	So now we've got clarity to what's being used for?
2848760	2852880	Well, they're just guessing, I think, based on the fact that it's danceable music.
2852880	2854080	I'm hoping for a DJ game.
2854080	2857120	I remember that Timberland thing coming up before.
2857120	2859760	So I think some of this is just, but I don't remember Cascada.
2859760	2861640	I would remember something like that.
2861640	2862640	Interesting.
2862640	2863640	Yeah.
2863640	2871800	And they're, you know, not really saying, this is coming also from Game Informer, the
2871800	2875360	rumor that they're saying they're working on a dancing game.
2875360	2880320	You know what, it makes sense if you think about it, because what game, you know, last
2880320	2885880	fall was just incredibly popular, in fact, I think it's still popular now, that I would've
2885880	2891120	never pegged to be at the top of some of these selling lists, and that would be Just Dance
2891120	2896600	from Ubisoft, which is basically a game where you dance around to cues on the screen.
2896600	2902000	And it makes sense that you would use this for, like, Natal or something.
2902000	2903000	I don't know.
2903000	2906600	I mean, it's not a big surprise to me, and I'm sure with Natal, and probably the same
2906600	2913040	with the move, you're gonna see lots of these really gimmicky things that the Wii has had
2913040	2914040	forever.
2914040	2918400	Yeah, but, I mean, Loki, to be fair, that gimmicky game is kind of the roots of our
2918400	2919400	show.
2919400	2920720	I mean, DDR was a bit of a gimmicky game.
2920720	2925680	I understand that, but there's a difference between, you know, following cues on screen,
2925680	2928680	like, you know, arrows going down the screen, and you actually have to hit them in time
2928680	2933280	with the beat, versus, I'm watching a person dance on screen, and I'm trying to emulate
2933280	2934280	what they're doing on screen.
2934280	2936600	I can watch MTV and do that, okay?
2936600	2938000	I don't have to pay for a game.
2938000	2942520	I get that, Loki, but here's the place where I have a little more hope than I do with all
2942520	2947200	the rest of that, is the fact that Harmonix is rumored to be tied into this.
2947200	2951240	Harmonix, I'm trying to think here, have they ever made a bad music game?
2951240	2954120	Just a straight up bad music game?
2954120	2955760	I can't think of one.
2955760	2959560	Maybe the chatters will jump in, but Harmonix makes pretty good games.
2959560	2960560	Guitar Hero.
2960560	2966400	Well, but, well, the first Guitar Hero was revolutionary, and so the second one was good
2966400	2968560	too, and then they jumped ship and made Rock Band.
2968560	2972000	They didn't have anything to do with the third thereafter, remember that?
2972000	2976440	So, I mean, Harmonix, the fact that they're involved gives me a little more hope.
2976440	2980600	I mean, if you think about it, Rock Band 3, I mean, how much more programming is Rock
2980600	2981600	Band 3 gonna take?
2981600	2986080	I mean, it's probably just the Beatles and Green Day Engine souped up a little more with
2986080	2989960	the keyboard, whatever's put in, you know, a little more something-something there.
2989960	2992600	There's probably something else being cooked up over there.
2992600	2996220	This makes perfect sense that this would be it.
2996220	2999480	And who's to say that it's not necessarily a game like DDR?
2999480	3005840	I mean, if Natal is supposed to be this magic thing that knows where you are in the room,
3005840	3009440	it could work just like DDR with no dance pad.
3009440	3013480	That's gonna look weird if it works like...
3013480	3014600	I don't know.
3014600	3017600	I think it's just gonna be just like Just Dance.
3017600	3023160	I mean, it's probably not gonna be any more elaborate than that.
3023160	3027480	It'll just be interesting because you'll be able to do multiplayer and that kind of stuff,
3027480	3032500	and it'll be more accurate because it's using a camera instead of just sensors in a close
3032500	3034560	approximation of whatever you're doing.
3034560	3039080	Maybe the joke is that these are actually tracks for Rock Band 3, because Rock Band
3039080	3042840	3 will also be incorporating dancers.
3042840	3045800	Or maybe they're working on a DJ game.
3045800	3046800	Perhaps.
3046800	3047800	Because they never said anything.
3047800	3051200	They're just saying, oh, it's gonna be an Natal-based dance game.
3051200	3055840	And I don't know if they're just guessing because, you know, Natal coming out soon,
3055840	3059800	and the fact that those types of games have done well in the past, and also because these
3059800	3060800	are danceable tracks.
3060800	3064680	I mean, there's a lot of speculation going on, unless they know something that we don't.
3064680	3073440	But being the expert analyst that I am, I'm sure it'll be something gimmicky.
3073440	3076960	Miklotov is actually in our chat room tonight, and he says, Rock Band Unplugged sucked.
3076960	3080200	Well, I mean, opinion is relative or whatever, but I actually disagree.
3080200	3083360	I think Rock Band Unplugged, it wasn't Rock Band.
3083360	3088880	It was frequency amplitude PSP with rock songs, but I didn't think it was bad at all.
3088880	3092240	And actually, the really cool thing about that game, remember, it was totally free.
3092240	3094840	The demo would work with the download songs, remember that?
3094840	3095840	Yep.
3095840	3096840	Good times.
3096840	3097840	So.
3097840	3102280	Blaze in our chat room says, maybe we'll finally get a Dance Mania-esque game.
3102280	3106080	Well, I mean, if these are the licensed songs, though, Blaze, I don't know if you're really
3106080	3108660	getting a Dance Mania-esque game.
3108660	3112360	Or are you thinking of Dance Maniacs, because there's Dance Mania, the CDs that inspired
3112360	3113360	the VR.
3113360	3114360	I think he's thinking Dance Maniacs.
3114360	3115360	Maybe he's thinking Dance Maniacs.
3115360	3117060	I'm gonna be honest.
3117060	3118060	I hope not.
3118060	3119240	I mean, don't get me wrong.
3119240	3123880	I like Dance Maniacs for what it was, but it's a little bit gimmicky, and I think it's
3123880	3124880	a $60 game.
3124880	3125880	The technology's old.
3125880	3128040	I just don't see it.
3128040	3130960	And the technology's old, and they're not gonna do anything like that anymore, because
3130960	3135440	now you can do full dancing games, because they have all these fun sensors that they
3135440	3136440	can use.
3136440	3140120	Couldn't they do better things with a Dance Maniacs-style soundtrack?
3140120	3141880	I think that's what we should be looking for.
3141880	3147040	I think we, especially as music game fans, I mean, OLR's been on for, what, eight years,
3147040	3149080	and DDR was started in 1998.
3149080	3153160	I mean, we've really got to start looking forward, not trying to emulate what's happened
3153160	3154160	in the past.
3154160	3155160	I think they-
3155160	3157640	And this is where Konami is failing miserably, by the way.
3157640	3159440	What happened to DDR out of Konami?
3159440	3162320	I mean, I don't want to spoil a story that's coming up later in the show, but we're gonna
3162320	3165400	be talking about the games that are gonna be shown at E3 this year.
3165400	3167680	I noticed DDR was not on the list from Konami.
3167680	3171120	I'm starting to wonder if that project was canceled.
3171120	3173160	Enter Harmonix!
3173160	3176280	Just like they did with Guitar Hero.
3176280	3177280	I just-
3177280	3178280	Time to start looking forward with our music game.
3178280	3181640	I just don't understand how they can screw that up so much.
3181640	3188880	I mean, the problem, I think, with DDR is they need new blood in the game, basically.
3188880	3193920	They need someone, like myself, to come in and just completely overhaul the damn game,
3193920	3198760	because what they're doing now, it's just not working.
3198760	3203160	So they need to go back to square one and just-
3203160	3208720	Maybe game companies, and maybe I'm giving this with too few examples, but maybe game
3208720	3212840	companies are finally kind of starting to listen to what the fans want a little bit.
3212840	3216200	And so Harmonix is like, gosh, the DDR fans kind of want something new.
3216200	3217200	Here you go.
3217200	3221940	Just like the Blur people were like, gee, people want to burn out Mario Kart game.
3221940	3222940	Here you go.
3222940	3223940	You know?
3223940	3224940	I don't know.
3224940	3225940	Maybe it's just me.
3225940	3227800	It seems like there seems to be a lot more fan service.
3227800	3234360	You're hearing a lot more, too, about old-ass games coming back from the dead on the iPhone
3234360	3237560	or on DS, and you've seen that a lot lately.
3237560	3238560	Unless it's Earthbound.
3238560	3240160	Happy birthday, by the way, Earthbound.
3240160	3245720	It's smart that they do listen to their fans, the people that are buying their games, to
3245720	3253280	make stuff that they intend on purchasing instead of, oh, I don't know, let's recreate
3253280	3255160	Karaoke Revolution again.
3255160	3256160	Yeah.
3256160	3261200	I remember that, because now instead of calling it Karaoke Revolution 4 or whatever the hell
3261200	3264800	number they were up to, oh, they're just going to re-release this, or release a new game
3264800	3268120	called Karaoke Revolution, and it's not going to be very different.
3268120	3272580	It's supposed to have had all this support with download content, but that never happened.
3272580	3278920	So I just can't buy what Konami's selling nowadays.
3278920	3280960	I mean, I don't know.
3280960	3281960	We'll see.
3281960	3283760	Well, E3 could surprise us.
3283760	3288760	Castlevania, because apparently that Castlevania game, the multiplayer one, is really legit,
3288760	3290400	and it should be super awesome.
3290400	3297840	No, I mean, the Silent Hill game got some good feedback on the Wii.
3297840	3303160	Konami's got some hype points, but there's just, unfortunately for those of us that liked
3303160	3306400	a certain aspect of what they were doing many years ago, that is no longer one of their
3306400	3307400	hype points.
3307400	3312120	You need to bring the Silent Hill and the Metal Gear Solid arcade games to the Wii.
3312120	3317160	Or actually now you can bring them out to the PS3 and the Xbox 360, because that'd be
3317160	3318160	awesome.
3318160	3319160	Take a cue from Sega.
3319160	3320880	Look at House of the Dead 2 and 3.
3320880	3322120	Awesome game, sold well.
3322120	3325360	Take a cue from that company who's doing the Rock of the Dead.
3325360	3328120	That's even cooler.
3328120	3329360	Come on.
3329360	3330360	Come on.
3330360	3331360	Don't do that look.
3331360	3332360	No, we shouldn't encourage conspiracy.
3332360	3333900	Yeah, the concept's cool.
3333900	3337480	It's going to suck, though, unfortunately.
3337480	3341920	Bond 006 and Chad seems to have a differing opinion on what I was saying about the fans
3341920	3342920	service.
3342920	3344640	Tell me about the company kissing the fan's ass.
3344640	3348480	I take offense to Capcom making Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3348480	3352720	I enjoyed 10 years of utter arrogance in telling my friends there will never be Marvel vs.
3352720	3355640	Capcom 3.
3355640	3359800	I think you gave another good example of fan service right there.
3359800	3361760	Like it or not, here it comes, right?
3361760	3362760	Four words.
3362760	3365880	Never say never ever.
3365880	3367160	Especially in gaming, right?
3367160	3372320	Especially with companies buying each other and people acquiring licenses that once were.
3372320	3375920	Like who would have thought, going back a few months, who would have thought we would
3375920	3379720	have ever got a sequel to Blaster Master?
3379720	3380720	I mean, right?
3380720	3384820	I mean, granted, it was not as good as it could have been, but it was a sequel to Blaster
3384820	3385820	Master.
3385820	3390200	If DC and Marvel can hook up, anything's possible.
3390200	3393040	Buying a commando re-armed, that's all I have to say.
3393040	3394600	That was awesome.
3394600	3398880	Sin and Punishment Sky successor from Ray Ayanami in chat, that's true, that's Sin and Punishment
3398880	3399880	games all.
3399880	3404880	And, you know, what's sad about that is it's not gonna sell well, and it's gonna be considered
3404880	3408840	probably a failure on Nintendo's part, and you won't see that many games like that.
3408840	3412080	Big words, Loki, what's to say that?
3412080	3413080	Why you say that?
3413080	3419840	Because every single mature or niche game on the Wii has not sold well.
3419840	3420960	All of them.
3420960	3422080	Think about this topic for next week.
3422080	3424560	I don't want to get into it tonight because we're running a little long anyway, but just
3424560	3427800	think about this topic for next week and write it down mentally in case I forget, because
3427800	3432560	I want to go through the different three press conferences, and I want to kind of ask this
3432560	3435520	question, and maybe this is a good email topic, too, for those of you guys who want to email
3435520	3439800	us this week, mailbagorangeandreadea.com, because we're gonna talk a lot pre-E3 next
3439800	3440800	week.
3440800	3445880	What could the big three do, Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, at their press conferences to make
3445880	3448580	you a rabid fanboy all over again?
3448580	3452160	And silly answers are fine, but give me some serious ones, too.
3452160	3456480	I'm gonna tell you right now what Sony's gotta do, and it's so simple and so obvious.
3456480	3459040	All right, all right, but now I want to change topics, because I don't want to ruin next
3459040	3460040	week.
3460040	3462360	And I feel really bad for not knowing the guy's name, but the guy that they have in
3462360	3466960	their commercials right now needs to be running that damn conference.
3466960	3467960	Really?
3467960	3468960	Yeah.
3468960	3469960	Interesting.
3469960	3475640	He's the best marketing campaign ever for Sony.
3475640	3477080	I would actually agree.
3477080	3483080	For a company that's had lots of missteps, lots of missteps, remember the black and white
3483080	3484080	PSP?
3484080	3485080	Yeah?
3485080	3486080	Remember that?
3486080	3487080	Yeah.
3487080	3488080	Remember the God of War lamb being served up?
3488080	3489080	Yeah.
3489080	3490080	For a company...
3490080	3491080	Cover the crane, baby.
3491080	3492080	Yeah.
3492080	3493720	This is a direction they should stick with.
3493720	3494720	I'll give you that.
3494720	3497400	I totally agree, and I'm sure that guy will be at E3.
3497400	3500800	Yeah, Kevin Butler, I think, was his name, or whatever.
3500800	3501800	Yeah.
3501800	3504160	He'll be there.
3504160	3505480	And our chat is lighting up.
3505480	3506480	Kevin Butler.
3506480	3507480	He's great.
3507480	3508680	He's the man, says Blaze.
3508680	3509680	Black Wolf says he's an actor.
3509680	3511120	I hope he does the intro.
3511120	3512120	I don't care.
3512120	3513120	I just hope he's there.
3513120	3514120	We'll see what happens.
3514120	3515680	All right, let's move on, though, guys.
3515680	3516680	We'll talk a little more E3 next week.
3516680	3519520	In fact, I hope he's in every press conference.
3519520	3521600	Here's one of the rumors about what's going to be seen.
3521600	3524960	Big, big, fat rumor, but it's kind of one of those rumors you look at and go, okay,
3524960	3526400	I can see that.
3526400	3533700	Apparently Hulu is being teased as a possible addition to the Xbox 360.
3533700	3536640	This is coming from Gear Live, which is a tech site.
3536640	3540560	Apparently they have picked up on a rumor that Hulu's streaming functionality, it's
3540560	3544240	going to be in the Xbox 360, it's going to be announced at E3.
3544240	3549480	One Up ran with the same rumor, saying that a Hulu application for the Xbox 360 definitely
3549480	3556720	exists, but the problem right now, it's tied up with rights issues.
3556720	3560000	Everybody wants a piece of the rights to the application.
3560000	3561000	What do you guys think?
3561000	3562000	Hulu on the 360.
3562000	3564960	Again, for those of you that don't know Hulu, Hulu's a website.
3564960	3571040	It was kind of launched as a competitor to YouTube, but instead of focusing on user-based
3571040	3573960	content, it kind of takes your favorite TV shows.
3573960	3578000	What I like best, a lot of old TV shows are showing up on there, too.
3578000	3581180	When I say old, I mean old and forgotten.
3581180	3587640	One of the awesome shows that's on there right now, the Dark Shadows revival from 1990 is
3587640	3590280	on Hulu, all of the episodes.
3590280	3591280	I know.
3591280	3592280	It's awesome that it's there.
3592280	3596160	I mean, prepare to be disappointed by the cliffhanger ending, because the show got canceled
3596160	3597160	midway through.
3597160	3600200	But, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff like that that I think would be a great addition
3600200	3601880	to the Xbox 360.
3601880	3602880	What do you guys think?
3602880	3603880	Fact or crap?
3603880	3604880	Hulu on the 360.
3604880	3606880	I think it definitely could happen.
3606880	3607880	It makes sense.
3607880	3609600	I think it could happen.
3609600	3613920	Going off the old standby that all rumors are, in fact, true, I could see it happening
3613920	3615200	too.
3615200	3617600	It's just a good alternative to Netflix.
3617600	3620540	The thing I didn't like, though, is they were saying that they were going to possibly charge
3620540	3624080	more money to access Hulu on the 360.
3624080	3630360	Which, if that's the case, that's retarded, because, I mean, if you just use your PC and
3630360	3636040	stream your PC to your 360, you can watch Hulu for free.
3636040	3637960	So why should I have to pay extra money?
3637960	3640800	Bochikawa in our chat says, yeah, all the consoles have internets.
3640800	3642440	Why couldn't you watch them on it already?
3642440	3644440	Well, I don't believe...
3644440	3645440	They block it.
3645440	3649240	Yeah, it's blocked on the PS3, right, and then I don't think the Wii has a high enough
3649240	3652480	flash version, and the Xbox 360, don't forget, it's missing a web browser.
3652480	3656680	I know, a lot of people think, just assume, oh yeah, I can surf the web on my 360.
3656680	3657680	Actually, you can't.
3657680	3661440	Well, it makes sense why they don't do that, because there's already enough holes in their
3661440	3664200	security.
3664200	3670620	And Wyland in our chat room says, if you want Dark Shadows, watch the original 1,245 episodes.
3670620	3672560	Bring them to Hulu, and maybe I'll start.
3672560	3677320	Although from what I understand, you don't really start watching Dark Shadows until about
3677320	3682360	episode, like, what is it, like 75, or whenever Barnabus is finally actually first introduced.
3682360	3685160	You can just kind of skip the first few.
3685160	3687920	That's what I'm understanding anyway, but I could be wrong.
3687920	3695600	All right, anyhow, so it sounds like it could be a fact we will find out in a week.
3695600	3699600	Because if it's not announced at E3, then it's not coming this year, that's for sure.
3699600	3701560	Dark Soccer, what you got for us?
3701560	3712560	Well, this is more Xbox news, but basically, Robbie Bach, who is the entertainment dude,
3712560	3714560	has retiring.
3714560	3718800	There was a memo that went out that said that he is retiring.
3718800	3721120	The memo was out by Steve Ballmer.
3721120	3728080	And also, Jay Allard is going to be retiring as well.
3728080	3734280	You gotta wonder if that means, like, retiring, like the little quotes there, like, retiring,
3734280	3736320	or having their butt pushed out the door.
3736320	3740200	Like, you know, there's always that kind of like, hmm, because, I mean, it's not like,
3740200	3742240	I don't think Jay Allard is 65.
3742240	3743480	He's not quite of that retirement age.
3743480	3748800	But they've just been there for a while, and basically Xbox is printing money.
3748800	3753920	Although, weren't they tied to a failure that Xbox had?
3753920	3755560	Wasn't there something, not Xbox.
3755560	3760600	I'd say that Microsoft was supposed to launch, was it a tablet computer or something?
3760600	3761600	Something like that.
3761600	3765440	Yeah, that didn't do, and I'm sure someone in chat will jump in, that didn't, I don't
3765440	3770280	think ended up happening at all, and now it's everybody's iPad, iPad, iPad, so, I mean,
3770280	3773440	it's just not going to happen there at Microsoft, so.
3773440	3778480	I wonder how they thought they could compete with Apple over that.
3778480	3785020	Some of our people in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, guest9595, I wish you'd change their name
3785020	3789640	so I could give them proper credit, but guest9595 says, hey, can't you watch Hulu and stuff
3789640	3791840	with play on for any of the systems?
3791840	3799720	That's right, that little software that lets you transfer your stuff over to the TV, right?
3799720	3803920	Well, I mean, there's that, there's, I prefer diversity.
3803920	3809680	I mean, you can stream Hulu, I use my PS3 to do that, and that works really well, so,
3809680	3814720	I mean, it works just the same on a 360, but yeah, you can do that, and that's what I'm
3814720	3815720	saying.
3815720	3816720	Why should I pay the extra?
3816720	3821720	The thing I'm guessing is it's going to be HD streaming, maybe, and you're going to get,
3821720	3827120	you know, one of the rumors was they're going to start charging for Hulu if you want to
3827120	3829320	watch some of the archive episodes.
3829320	3833240	The recent episodes will be free, but the stuff past, like, you know, the first or second
3833240	3834240	most recent episodes.
3834240	3835360	Well, that's at the website now, isn't it?
3835360	3838180	Like, you can watch the last five episodes of Glee, but if you want to watch anything
3838180	3839600	older than that, you can't.
3839600	3843800	Yeah, but they're going to allow you to, but you're going to have the bill to pay, so.
3843800	3846680	Good thing I don't want to watch any episodes of that.
3846680	3852040	Well, you're missing out, and that's how Sue sees it.
3852040	3856960	I tried, and it made me feel a little nauseous.
3856960	3859400	You and Alan should start a club, because he hates it too.
3859400	3861480	All right, what else was I going to say?
3861480	3863880	Oh, about the Hulu and the pay thing.
3863880	3867320	I guess maybe this wouldn't really be tied together, because it's kind of, you know,
3867320	3871240	Microsoft and Hulu, but remember last week, I kind of went off on this whole project $10,
3871240	3873960	and I said, why the hell are we paying for Xbox Live anymore?
3873960	3879080	Well, I mean, this is a feature that maybe could keep me an Xbox Live Gold member.
3879080	3880080	Hmm?
3880080	3881080	Maybe?
3881080	3882080	Hmm?
3882080	3890840	You know, and I'm just, and we're going to get into some project $10 stuff soon, but
3890840	3896760	just to kind of talk about it, I'm mad at the idea of it, and the reason I'm mad at
3896760	3900200	the idea is not necessarily that it affects me, but it affects a lot of other people,
3900200	3905040	because me personally, I either buy new games, or I don't buy the games, and not necessarily
3905040	3910240	that I wouldn't buy used games, but I mean, if there's a game that I don't think I'm
3910240	3915280	going to be playing, I probably won't pick it up, just because I know myself, and I know
3915280	3920200	that if I buy a game that I'm not so hot on, I won't end up playing it.
3920200	3928040	It'll just be sitting, collecting dust, so for me, it's not such a big deal, but,
3928040	3932560	you know, if you just let one thing slide, then it's just going to be a whole mess of
3932560	3939080	crap that's going to, you know, come out later on, so that's why I'm kind of pissed off
3939080	3943880	that EA's doing the whole project $10 thing, and then now THQ's following suit with that,
3943880	3948560	and as I rumored last week, Microsoft will probably be following suit with that as well,
3948560	3953440	and if Microsoft does it, then we'll have other people doing it, and...
3953440	3954440	Why not?
3954440	3955440	Go for it.
3955440	3956440	You want to talk more project $10.
3956440	3957440	Who else?
3957440	3958440	Who's going in?
3958440	3964800	Sega is considering joining some sort of online pass system.
3964800	3966880	This is me scolding Sega.
3966880	3967880	Sega!
3967880	3975360	And, you know, basically, Ubisoft is also kind of liking the idea, and Sega is saying,
3975360	3980760	you know, it's a very clever idea, and they're certainly taking looks to see what happens
3980760	3987240	with it, and they're saying of course, you know, that they want to be careful to make
3987240	3991880	sure that, you know, the EA, you know, sports thing that they're doing right now actually
3991880	3996760	works out, and, you know, the backlash isn't too big, but if it ends up working out for
3996760	4002560	them, then perhaps they will allow you to, they will do something very similar.
4002560	4006960	What's kind of funny, though, is, you know, we were talking about the whole online pass
4006960	4012520	thing and the project $10 stuff with EA, and one of the theories was they wanted to kind
4012520	4016600	of put this out there so that they can make some money from used sales, and also it may
4016600	4022840	curb a little bit of the piracy because the fact that, you know, if you, at least if you're
4022840	4027080	pirating the game and you want to play it online, you still have to pay them some money.
4027080	4030960	So, you know, that might be one reason.
4030960	4040560	But then, EA's, I guess, UK General Manager Keith Ramsdale basically made a comment and
4040560	4046640	said, no, actually the project $10 online pass are not about that.
4046640	4050320	It's all about the customer and improving their experience.
4050320	4057440	It's simply not a defensive measure against pre-owned or piracy.
4057440	4061760	I'm sorry, my bullshit meter was going off.
4061760	4067200	I mean, if that isn't a bunch of corporate speak.
4067200	4070320	Improving the customer experience, come on.
4070320	4071320	That's retarded then.
4071320	4075880	I would rather they come out and say, yeah, it's actually the curb piracy and used sales
4075880	4080880	because now the fact that you're saying no, it's actually just to make your online play
4080880	4085360	even better, but the online play isn't changing, then that just means no, you're actually just
4085360	4086360	grabbing at money.
4086360	4091880	At least, you know, give it the, you know, excuse that, oh, we're actually just trying
4091880	4093440	to make some money off of used sales.
4093440	4095240	Actually, don't even bother with the used sales.
4095240	4097800	So say you're just using it to combat piracy.
4097800	4101440	I mean, because everybody is like, okay, piracy, you know, that makes sense.
4101440	4109480	But I'm sorry, I don't play a lot of EA games, at least not the sports stuff.
4109480	4115940	So I mean, I'm guessing just looking at this stuff that, you know, Tiger Woods PGA Tour
4115940	4120880	11 when it's coming out on Tuesday here, I'm guessing that the online play is not going
4120880	4124520	to be that different from Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10.
4124520	4128160	And by all means, people should really look into that, because if this is their claim
4128160	4133000	that, oh, we're doing this to the benefit of, you know, our consumers, then you need
4133000	4134000	to look at...
4134000	4136440	I think you should write a comparison for OrangeLongTraded.com.
4136440	4139640	I don't want to play Tiger Woods 10 or 11.
4139640	4144840	Scour on the internet, or don't you get access to games through your job or something?
4144840	4145840	No.
4145840	4151960	You know, so they need to look at, you know, 10 and 11 to see, okay, was 10, the latency
4151960	4159200	better in 11, is, you know, the options better in 11, and all this stuff, because I bet you
4159200	4161640	if you look at that, it's not.
4161640	4164680	I bet you it's the same damn shit all over again.
4164680	4168040	And it really doesn't make any sense that they're charging people they're buying used
4168040	4172000	for these games, because they've already gotten the money for these games.
4172000	4174860	There's no reason they need more money for these games.
4174860	4179240	You're not adding more users to the online, because this is still one copy of a game that's
4179240	4180600	floating around out there.
4180600	4181640	You've already made your money.
4181640	4187520	So if you can't run your, you know, infrastructure on the money that you've made, you know, on
4187520	4192760	new games, it just doesn't make any sense, because what if, which is, it's not going
4192760	4198680	to happen, but what if, you know, say, you know, this whole online passing ends up flopping,
4198680	4202920	and you're not making any money for, you know, the online games.
4202920	4207440	People aren't paying to play online more than that seven-day trial.
4207440	4208760	Well then nothing changes.
4208760	4209760	Then nothing changes.
4209760	4213680	Because that's not going to motivate them to get rid of it, because they're still going
4213680	4215200	to make money off new games.
4215200	4216200	Exactly.
4216200	4220880	And if you think about it though, you know, what are they hoping to accomplish by this?
4220880	4225840	They're hoping that people either buy the game new, or they're going to basically, you
4225840	4231240	know, hope that they pay the ten dollars or whatever, five dollars, to actually play online.
4231240	4236000	But if people don't pay that, and they don't receive enough revenue, then guess what?
4236000	4239240	The online experience doesn't change at all.
4239240	4246320	So basically making their whole point, you know, you know, nonsense.
4246320	4250920	Because if they're not making money from this extra use sales, and using it to improve their
4250920	4255560	service, then they're full of shit.
4255560	4256560	Alright.
4256560	4260360	Uh, let's move on with another story, because this is like three weeks in a row we've talked
4260360	4262000	about this stupid thing now.
4262000	4263000	It's because it's dumb.
4263000	4268600	I know, I know, I know, and it's something new is coming up every week, and sadly we're
4268600	4271560	probably going to hear even more about it at E3, and what other companies are going
4271560	4274040	to jump on board, yippie yippie.
4274040	4279000	Speaking of things that are full of bullshit, somebody has filed a lawsuit against Sony
4279000	4285760	and Square Enix, because Final Fantasy 13 caused severe and widespread damage to PlayStation
4285760	4287320	3 consoles.
4287320	4291680	It was filed by Daniel Wolf, it's a class action lawsuit, meaning if he wins you'll
4291680	4293080	all get a piece of this.
4293080	4302040	But Wolf reckons that it freezes, and PlayStation 3s, and when you play this you can get your
4302040	4307720	PS3 console to become totally and permanently inoperable.
4307720	4311600	The lawsuit says both defendants are eminently aware of the damage being caused by their
4311600	4316360	defective products, and have chosen to do nothing about it.
4316360	4322040	They're being sued, I guess, for over 5 million in damages, and relief is being sought.
4322040	4326600	Meaning that, you know, if you are affected by you having both of these things, you could
4326600	4330400	get your very own coupon for $5 in the mail, that'll probably be the piece of this that
4330400	4331620	you're entitled to.
4331620	4333800	That's usually what happens with these class action lawsuits.
4333800	4334800	Whatever.
4334800	4335800	I mean...
4335800	4338800	It doesn't make any sense, because it's not widespread.
4338800	4345220	Was Xbox, I know, did Xbox ever have to settle for the Red Rings of Death thing?
4345220	4348280	Because in my opinion, that was a much bigger problem.
4348280	4353920	I think that's why they extended the warranty to three years, I thought.
4353920	4354920	But I could be wrong.
4354920	4359120	But it doesn't matter, because this isn't widespread.
4359120	4362360	Where are your data on this?
4362360	4363360	Where is the data?
4363360	4364360	Seriously, because...
4364360	4367840	Rob, you own Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3.
4367840	4371000	Is your PS3 inoperable because of Final Fantasy XIII?
4371000	4375720	No, but there was that one day, like what, March 1st or whatever, when all the clocks
4375720	4378780	were fucked up, remember that?
4378780	4382840	But that wouldn't be because of Final Fantasy XIII since it came out after that.
4382840	4386720	So I mean, I don't know.
4386720	4391120	I would think that that would be hard to prove in the first place.
4391120	4398020	That there is widespread damage, because it's like a dude, saying, oh, my system crashed.
4398020	4403520	By the way, just randomly asking this question, how many of you remember the one day the PS3s
4403520	4404520	were down?
4404520	4406080	I bet most of you forgot.
4406080	4409400	And that was only about three months ago.
4409400	4411400	Just saying.
4411400	4412400	There was that, remember that one day?
4412400	4413400	Yeah, I remember that one day.
4413400	4414780	Yes, yeah, it was one day.
4414780	4416240	Three months ago, going retro here on a lot.
4416240	4420480	In case you forgot, too, Activision was being total dicks to Infinity Ward as well.
4420480	4422060	Just refreshing that.
4422060	4423160	We should do that every week.
4423160	4425880	We should have like, hey, you know, in case you forgot.
4425880	4428480	Never, we'll have a segment called Never Forget.
4428480	4432520	Never Forget.
4432520	4433520	Never Forget.
4433520	4437040	Remember that time that Namco's really pissed off at us?
4437040	4439040	Never Forget.
4439040	4442760	I like it, man.
4442760	4445160	We're full of ideas this month.
4445160	4446160	I like that.
4446160	4448320	I think that should be a segment that we do regularly.
4448320	4449320	For Forget.
4449320	4450320	Never Forget.
4450320	4451320	Never.
4451320	4452680	It should be Never Forget.
4452680	4453680	Never Forget.
4453680	4454680	Never Forget.
4454680	4456680	Oh, no, we should do that on the website.
4456680	4457680	There you go.
4457680	4461320	Oh, that is a wonderful idea for a series of articles.
4461320	4464440	I don't, is there an OLR fan that maybe wants to pick that up?
4464440	4469680	But we need to do actually more stuff that's like, you know, a lot older than just the
4469680	4470680	Infinity Ward thing.
4470680	4471680	Because that's pretty recent.
4471680	4474520	Well, I bet some people are forgetting about it, though, already.
4474520	4475520	I understand that.
4475520	4476520	I mean, out of sight, out of mind.
4476520	4479920	When that stuff stops getting reported in the media, people are like, oh, yeah, I was
4479920	4481400	really mad about that.
4481400	4482400	Like, that happened.
4482400	4486520	I was listening to an old OLR randomly the other day, I don't know why, and it was not
4486520	4487520	that old.
4487520	4488520	Like, a couple months ago.
4488520	4495680	And I was talking about how the, remember when Xbox, Never Forget.
4495680	4499940	When Xbox Live used to discriminate against the word gay being in your profile.
4499940	4501720	But they did get rid of that.
4501720	4505200	But I remember when I, I think we were reporting it here on the show.
4505200	4509560	And I was like, oh, yeah, I was really mad about that when that first happened.
4509560	4512160	But I kind of forgot that that had happened.
4512160	4518720	So we do need a Never Forget, so that, like, things that I get mad about, and you get mad
4518720	4521300	about, and Jamie gets mad about, we never forget.
4521300	4522800	Maybe it could be like a page on the wiki.
4522800	4528600	And when one of us says, Never Forget this, somebody can add it to the wiki, so that way
4528600	4530160	we never forget.
4530160	4532720	Ah, yes.
4532720	4534720	I like that idea.
4534720	4538560	People are crazy.
4538560	4540360	Whatever.
4540360	4541360	You know it's a good idea.
4541360	4542360	It's a dark circle.
4542360	4544480	Surely there's something in your mind.
4544480	4549200	You're like, you know what, never forget that this happened.
4549200	4552280	Never forget that people are bitches.
4552280	4553360	Well that's just a given.
4553360	4554760	That has nothing to do with gaming.
4554760	4555760	It's alright.
4555760	4559080	Okay, never forget the crystalline entity is a bitch.
4559080	4560080	There you go.
4560080	4561720	Now you're, now you're on the right track.
4561720	4566640	Never forget Half-Life 2 Episode 3 still isn't out yet.
4566640	4571160	But maybe, maybe that's why the Portal 2 thing was canceled, because they're gonna show Half-Life.
4571160	4574560	Here's the thing, I think the Portal 2 thing is still happening, but I think that they're
4574560	4578640	under, you know, they're all, yeah, the event was canceled, but you know, then there's gonna
4578640	4582720	be like, oh haha, Aperture Science has trapped you all, and now you must run through this
4582720	4583720	maze.
4583720	4585800	Let Jamie get her thought out, and then I've got an idea on that.
4585800	4591320	Well, from what I was reading, though, Half-Life 3 is gonna have, actually, Shell from Portal
4591320	4598040	is supposed to be making her appearance, and then they also are talking about the, um,
4598040	4601800	what's the name of that ship that Aperture put out, that's supposed to show up?
4601800	4605160	Oh, it's a cameo at the end of Portal, isn't it?
4605160	4606160	I think?
4606160	4616040	No, they, they mention it in that retooled portal, but um, but like, it's some ship that,
4616040	4620200	of Aperture's that crashed or something, but anyway, I don't remember the whole deal.
4620200	4625280	Okay, here's what I was supposed to say about the Portal 2 party, um, is that, I bet what
4625280	4629120	they're doing, like, did you hear that really fucked up story, never forget this, by the
4629120	4633360	way, did you hear that really fucked up story about that school in, like, Mississippi or
4633360	4637240	whatever, where the, the girl wanted to go to the prom with her girlfriend, but they
4637240	4641120	were like, no, cause you're a dirty lesbian, and we're not gonna have that happen in our
4641120	4644200	prom, da da da, and what they did, you know what they ended up doing?
4644200	4650360	They threw another prom, and invited, like, her and her girlfriend and like, eight school
4650360	4655280	misfits to, like, the fake prom, and they had, like, a real prom somewhere else.
4655280	4656280	Yeah, that was crap.
4656280	4659040	That was fucked up beyond belief, right?
4659040	4661800	What if that's what they're doing with the Portal 2 party?
4661800	4666840	They're like, sorry guys, the Portal 2 party got cancelled.
4666840	4669000	I seriously think- But then suddenly we'll see these reports
4669000	4674000	on the internet about, oh, oh, oh, well 1UP.com got invited to this, uh, this super secret
4674000	4675000	party.
4675000	4678400	No, I seriously think that they're gonna actually have, it's gonna be this, you know, oh, it's
4678400	4682840	actually a secret surprise, and then, you know, the surprise is, oh, look at this, you
4682840	4688840	know, the, you know, GLaDOS has, uh, hacked the conference or something, you know, something
4688840	4691040	ridiculous like that.
4691040	4694480	Salacious Pop saves the day, Dark Sakura.
4694480	4696000	The Borealis is the ship.
4696000	4697000	That was it.
4697000	4698000	There you go.
4698000	4700920	I knew it had some sort of celestial name.
4700920	4705440	No, that's, like, the Aurora Borealis.
4705440	4709160	And Bobby's reminding us that he was supposed to go to the Portal 2 party and he's a misfit
4709160	4710160	now.
4710160	4714760	So, sorry, Bobby Black Wolf, but, uh, it very well could be that you have something in common
4714760	4715760	with a lesbian in Mississippi.
4715760	4716760	Off to the island with you.
4716760	4718440	I'll throw you your improv.
4718440	4719640	That's okay, Bobby.
4719640	4723740	I didn't get invited to anything, so we can have drinks.
4723740	4724740	I take that back.
4724740	4727200	I, I, I do have an appointment to see Rock Band 3.
4727200	4728200	Whoo!
4728200	4729200	What?
4729200	4730200	So, there's that.
4730200	4731200	Remember, steal a keytar.
4731200	4732200	Okay.
4732200	4733200	Lord.
4733200	4736640	Then you'll really be reading about that on the blog, the blogs.
4736640	4740800	All right, look, let's move on, uh, Dark Sakura.
4740800	4744840	We need, we need a dose of, like, something really cool and awesome in this show.
4744840	4745840	How about some class?
4745840	4746840	All right.
4746840	4747840	We need, this show could use a little class.
4747840	4749560	Actually, this show could use a lot of class.
4749560	4751640	More class than a class action lawsuit.
4751640	4758280	Anyway, first, I must preface this by saying that it is about the recently knighted Sir
4758280	4760280	Patrick Stewart.
4760280	4762240	Whoo!
4762240	4763240	That makes me happy.
4763240	4764240	About damn time.
4764240	4766440	So, now, you must address him as Sir Patrick Stewart.
4766440	4767440	Sir Patrick Stewart.
4767440	4768440	Patrick Stewart.
4768440	4775800	At, at, at any rate, um, he's basically on record saying that he loves his beautiful
4775800	4781640	iPhone, that it has become an extension of himself, that he couldn't imagine going without
4781640	4785480	it or his laptop, but that he has a stack of video games.
4785480	4789200	I want to hear Patrick Stewart narrate a story about how much he loves his iPhone.
4789200	4791400	There's a video on this one, too.
4791400	4792400	Really?
4792400	4793400	Talking about it.
4793400	4802440	Um, but, um, he's saying that, um, he has, um, in fact, I'll read the quote, the only
4802440	4807320	aspect of all this that I've never taken to in part because I have an addictive temperament
4807320	4808320	is gaming.
4808320	4812240	I have a stack of games that I've never taken the covers off of because I feel that if I
4812240	4814960	do I'm finished.
4814960	4816840	Can I just listen to a little bit of Patrick Stewart?
4816840	4817840	Yes.
4817840	4818840	Can I, can I just listen to his voice?
4818840	4819840	Okay, first of all, Rob.
4819840	4820840	What?
4820840	4821840	Did you see him in Jeffrey?
4821840	4822840	Yeah.
4822840	4823840	Years ago.
4823840	4824840	God, I love it.
4824840	4826840	I love him in that movie.
4826840	4827840	Shh.
4827840	4828840	Shh.
4828840	4829840	Shh.
4829840	4830840	Shh.
4830840	4831840	Shh.
4831840	4832840	Everybody worship.
4832840	4833840	Seems to me to be a little bit simplistic.
4833840	4837280	Maybe I like complexity and, uh, abstraction too much.
4837280	4847000	Um, but on the other hand, I just handed someone my beautiful iPhone, which I never have out
4847000	4852960	of my hand and that I do everything with and has become an extension of who I am.
4852960	4855520	I travel with my laptop everywhere.
4855520	4860360	Emails are absolutely sexual in my life.
4860360	4861360	His voice.
4861360	4862360	It sounds like he said sexual in my life.
4862360	4863360	He did say sexual.
4863360	4864360	Didn't he?
4864360	4866920	He could just read the phone book to me.
4866920	4867920	Sorry.
4867920	4869560	That was, and that was really quiet over the feed.
4869560	4870560	I apologize guys.
4870560	4873560	I don't know why it's so quiet.
4873560	4874560	Oh, beautiful.
4874560	4875560	I know, right?
4875560	4876560	Sorry.
4876560	4877560	Patrick Stewart.
4877560	4878560	Sorry.
4878560	4879560	Tiger, sir.
4879560	4880560	Patrick Stewart.
4880560	4881560	Sir Patrick Stewart.
4881560	4882560	Sir.
4882560	4883560	Patrick Stewart.
4883560	4884560	Sir.
4884560	4885560	So haha.
4885560	4886560	All you people who don't like Apple.
4886560	4887560	Haha.
4887560	4888560	All right.
4888560	4889560	Patrick.
4889560	4890560	Sir.
4890560	4891560	Patrick Stewart endorses it.
4891560	4892560	Haha.
4892560	4894560	It's just cause he hasn't touched a droid, right?
4894560	4895560	Loki.
4895560	4898080	Not since the days of Star Trek, the next generation has he ever touched a droid.
4898080	4899080	Uh, Loki.
4899080	4902480	How about some release dates?
4902480	4905560	Release dates traveling around the globe, talking about what's coming out in a neighborhood
4905560	4906560	near you.
4906560	4907560	Yes.
4907560	4910920	Um, this week, yeah, not a lot.
4910920	4914760	There's just some weird stuff and, uh, some decent stuff.
4914760	4916320	So let's start with the weird stuff.
4916320	4919320	America's next top model on DS and the Wii.
4919320	4920320	Sorry.
4920320	4921320	Wait a minute.
4921320	4924320	I thought that was supposed to come out like two weeks ago cause I remember cracking a-
4924320	4925320	I'm sorry.
4925320	4927000	As soon as Loki said that I had to yawn really bad.
4927000	4928000	Hey, listen.
4928000	4931080	I remember cracking a Tyra Banks is crazy joke.
4931080	4936760	I understand that and she is crazy, but you know, it'll come out when it's ready to come
4936760	4937760	out.
4937760	4938760	Just like Tyra.
4938760	4943760	Uh, Call of Duty, the war collection, uh, making its way out on Xbox 360.

4945760	4947760	Um, let's see.
4947760	4951960	I wonder if the top model game will have a panty party in it.
4951960	4956480	If you've never seen this YouTube, you need to YouTube, Google this on YouTube or whatever,
4956480	4957480	YouTube it.
4957480	4961240	Um, Tyra Banks panty party.
4961240	4964680	It's the funniest thing I've ever seen on the Tyra Banks show.
4964680	4970440	She goes, we're going to have a panty party.
4970440	4971520	Sorry random piggy.
4971520	4976480	I've been, I've been a woman most of my life.
4976480	4978160	I was a girl before that.
4978160	4981360	I've never had a panty party.
4981360	4983000	You haven't lived.
4983000	4984880	How about a manty party?
4984880	4987600	No thank you.
4987600	4992480	Uh, let's play ballerina on the DS.
4992480	4996760	Let's hope they never put out let's play doctor because that will be very inappropriate.
4996760	5001760	Uh, green day rock band coming out on Wii, PlayStation three and Xbox 360.
5001760	5007840	They also have a rock band green day rock band plus in case you don't want to pay for
5007840	5011200	the extra $10 to dump your songs.
5011200	5016800	Um, it's included in the price this time and it's still $10 more, but you get some free
5016800	5017800	download content.
5017800	5018800	So that's cool.

5062320	5065560	You can do harmonies with your balls.
5065560	5072880	Clearly it's nothing but David Bowie songs, if that's the case.
5072880	5079760	Satisfashion rock the runway on DS and I think that's also on the Wii as well.
5079760	5086520	Why do I know this, uh, Tiger Woods, PGA tour 11 on PlayStation three, Xbox 360 and PC.

5119840	5125040	Uh, stuff that's coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 grand theft auto episodes
5125040	5126040	from Liberty city.

5136480	5138080	at E3 this year, saints row three.
5138080	5141400	Yeah, but it's not being released until next year and that makes me sad.
5141400	5146200	Although seeing how far that they went with, um, the red faction in the new red faction
5146200	5149800	Armageddon game, or I think it's Armageddon is the subtitle on that.
5149800	5150800	It looks awesome.
5150800	5155300	And if that looks awesome, saints row three is going to be that much more awesome.
5155300	5157880	It's going to be more awesomer and that should be what's on the title.
5157880	5163280	More awesomer than saints row two, uh, PlayStation three gets the same stuff.

5200600	5201600	That's super popular though.

5239160	5240240	That's a pretty big deal.
5240240	5246280	As well as Marugokaku Shikaku Dasu Gaishiyoshi Seiken comes out this week.
5246280	5248000	Boy, that's a mouthful.
5248000	5249120	What is this game all about?
5249120	5250120	I don't know.
5250120	5251120	That's what she said.
5251120	5255960	Because there's nothing on the cover that I can understand except a little picture.
5255960	5258240	It looks like navigation software could be.
5258240	5262000	So that's probably going to be completely useless to you here in the US and I just wasted
5262000	5263520	30 seconds of your time.
5263520	5267960	So let's move to the PSP and talk about what is coming out on the PSP this week over in
5267960	5270320	Japan.
5270320	5274320	Wand of Fortune Portable is the big release on the PSP this week.
5274320	5277360	Wand of Fortune Portable from Idea Factory, an adventure game.
5277360	5283280	I don't see any screenshots, but the characters look like anime Harry Potter people, so I'm
5283280	5284320	sure that'll be fun.
5284320	5287160	Never forget Zelda, Wand of Gamelon.
5287160	5290520	Oh god, was that the 3DO game?
5290520	5291520	Yes.
5291520	5292520	One of them.
5292520	5293520	Oh, cry.
5293520	5297400	I played that at a classic gaming expo a couple years ago.
5297400	5298800	It was terrible.
5298800	5300120	Good times.
5300120	5302440	Alright, Dark Sakura.
5302440	5304960	How about the old country?
5304960	5309160	Well, really not a whole lot.
5309160	5311760	On the 8th is Green Day Rock Band.
5311760	5312760	Yay.
5312760	5315960	9th is Joe Danger.
5315960	5322080	And then toward the end of the week, on the 11th, we have King Arthur, Mega Man Zero Collection,
5322080	5327200	Naval Assault the Killing Tide, and Super Mario Galaxy 2.
5327200	5328200	The end.
5328200	5329800	It's over!
5329800	5333200	By the way, surprise that no one in studio had anything to say on Super Mario Galaxy
5333200	5334200	2.
5334200	5337080	My Wii is still not hooked up, that's why I haven't bought the game yet, but I am hearing
5337080	5339800	phenomenal things about the game.
5339800	5340800	So have I.
5340800	5341800	I just kinda...
5341800	5343120	I know, it's kind of under the radar right now.
5343120	5345600	It's kinda one of those games I hope I can go back to and play at some point, but for
5345600	5348000	right now it's kind of on the back burner.
5348000	5351080	But yeah, I've heard lots and lots of good things about Mario Galaxy 2.
5351080	5352560	Apparently outshines the first.
5352560	5354520	Well, that'll be impressive.
5354520	5357760	Yeah, the first was not a bad game at all.
5357760	5362160	Perhaps Nintendo can send me a free copy once I pimp out my room in New Super Mario Bros.
5362160	5363160	Eh?
5363160	5364160	Eh?
5364160	5365160	You should try it.
5365160	5366160	You never know.
5366160	5367160	You know, future gamer.
5367160	5368160	No.
5368160	5369520	Teaching them young.
5369520	5373000	I'm telling you, when you do that to your kid, your kid's gonna rebel.
5373000	5378240	You're gonna have a kid that wants to go out and play football all day?
5378240	5380280	I don't care if he wants to go play football, that's fine with me.
5380280	5384000	I'm not forcing him to like video games, that's just the theme we're doing his room in.
5384000	5385000	Alright, fair enough.
5385000	5386000	He can do whatever he wants.
5386000	5391160	If he wants to go work on cars and play football and that kind of stuff, that's fine with me.
5391160	5392960	He won't though.
5392960	5399800	My mom was a painter, and so she painted my room all in Sesame Street characters.
5399800	5406760	See, I guess it could work that way, because my parents gave me a baseball mitt and football
5406760	5413880	and stuff like that, but my dad, on the other hand, he bought a ColecoVision for himself
5413880	5418380	and Atari games and stuff, and then I just naturally started playing those, they bought
5418380	5420160	me a Texas Instruments computer.
5420160	5422600	That's right, because you were born in like 81, right?
5422600	5423600	When all that was out?
5423600	5424600	I was 80.
5424600	5425600	80?
5425600	5426600	Okay, 80.
5426600	5431080	When all that stuff came out, and just naturally I got into it, and the stuff that I was into
5431080	5438240	like when I was that old, you know, I'm into now even more so.
5438240	5439240	I don't know.
5439240	5442320	I'm not going to force it upon them, I'm not going to like, you have to play games, because
5442320	5447040	my wife hates games, which is ironic that she suggested that we do a Mario Brothers
5447040	5448040	themed room.
5448040	5449360	I never would have thought that.
5449360	5450360	I know.
5450360	5451360	I'm surprised.
5451360	5454520	Well, your wife does have those random moments of gaming.
5454520	5456760	Like you know, she loves Bejeweled, right?
5456760	5459380	And there's other stuff she's played too, right?
5459380	5462520	She said that we couldn't do the pixelated Mario on the wall.
5462520	5466840	She didn't want the old school Mario, because she wanted it cutesy and bright and colorful
5466840	5470720	and I guess Mario, you know, New Super Mario Brothers, you know, those stuff, because we
5470720	5475800	were originally just going to do just the decals on the wall, but the problem is those
5475800	5482520	decals that you buy for like $70 a sheet, which is really ridiculous, they only have
5482520	5488640	so much ground, it's like four feet worth of the ground vinyl, and we just can't circle
5488640	5490960	the room with that stuff, so we have to paint everything.
5490960	5494800	I mean, I'm not going to spend, you know, money to buy enough sheets to cover the whole
5494800	5495800	room.
5495800	5496800	It'd be ridiculous.
5496800	5499160	Why are all the guests leaving the funny comments tonight?
5499160	5504000	Guest 5872, please change your name, folks, when you get in there, type slash Nick, and
5504000	5506240	then the new name, and I can credit you if I really...
5506240	5507480	Or you get booted.
5507480	5513560	Tsukibon Satu-rena, you should do this room in President Cat.
5513560	5514960	Clearly it's a listener of the show.
5514960	5521560	We almost did it in Stella theme, Stella would be my cat, so, but that would be weird.
5521560	5522560	Kitty theme.
5522560	5526280	She is a little bitch.
5526280	5533300	She wants me to play, because we made her a toy out of bag handles, these little like
5533300	5538660	string handles or whatever, and we tied them together, and now she'll go like drag this
5538660	5543560	thing around me, and if I don't play with her, then she starts biting me, so she's a
5543560	5544560	little bitch sometimes.
5544560	5545560	But I love her.
5545560	5547560	She locked her in a room with Shermie.
5547560	5548560	Alright.
5548560	5549560	We gotta move on, guys.
5549560	5550560	She wins.
5550560	5552160	We're an hour and a half into part A, and we're not even done yet.
5552160	5554200	But we haven't talked about my cat enough yet.
5554200	5556480	I'm sorry, I really want a cat, y'all.
5556480	5561240	I'm getting to that point, I think it's time for me to be a daddy.
5561240	5562640	Like Rob needs to be a daddy.
5562640	5563640	What?
5563640	5564640	You're in luck.
5564640	5565640	Because I have a cat for you.
5565640	5567320	No, I don't want your cat.
5567320	5568320	No, not my cat.
5568320	5569320	Screw that.
5569320	5570320	My cat.
5570320	5571320	My cat.
5571320	5573720	I'm talking about Barney, the female cat outside.
5573720	5579520	That is, she's still a wild cat, but she, and yeah, I don't know why we call her Barney,
5579520	5583880	but we, that's the name we gave her before we found out that she was a girl, and so it
5583880	5584880	just stuck.
5584880	5590680	But she actually is very friendly and comes up to us and stuff, so I will trap her for
5590680	5591680	you if you want.
5591680	5595760	I'm not, oh great, I brought you a kitty in a box.
5595760	5597120	Adopt a cat, Rob.
5597120	5600560	Yeah, I'm not gonna do it just yet, like I think I need to move.
5600560	5602120	They're so easy to take care of though.
5602120	5605340	I know, but remember, I'm gone every weekend, you guys.
5605340	5606340	Every weekend I'm gone.
5606340	5608120	So I'll go take care of your cat on the weekends.
5608120	5609120	You won't.
5609120	5610120	Yes I will.
5610120	5611120	It's too far.
5611120	5613200	No, I go take care of Susan's cat when she goes out of town.
5613200	5614200	Really?
5614200	5615200	We'll see, we'll see, guys.
5615200	5618800	Rob, I would take care of your pussy.
5618800	5620400	Would you pet my pussy when it needed it?
5620400	5621400	Yes I would.
5621400	5622400	Thank you.
5622400	5624400	And give it a bath.
5624400	5626920	Hi, I'd wash your meat.
5626920	5628960	Would you wash my pussy on the weekend?
5628960	5632720	Well, I got a schedule.
5632720	5635760	Never forget how mature we are here at Orange Laundry Radio.
5635760	5638960	Alright, a couple quick stories for you, classic game of the week coming up.
5638960	5640880	Loki, what do you got for us?
5640880	5646040	Yes, so we were talking a little bit about Project $10 and how EA likes to find ways
5646040	5649160	to milk you for your precious money.
5649160	5653720	Well, now they're doing it again, and this isn't something that you necessarily have
5653720	5657280	to do, but it's something you may be tempted to do.
5657280	5666200	Madden 11 basically logs everything that you do online, your play calling, what tendencies
5666200	5668880	you do, and that kind of stuff, and it builds kind of a playbook.
5668880	5671440	Wait, wait, wait, you can't see your porn collection, can it?
5671440	5672440	No.
5672440	5674640	It can't see your porn collection.
5674640	5681960	And it basically builds like a playbook that kind of revolves around what you do.
5681960	5689040	And now, if you play, I guess, enough people or whatever, other people can get that from
5689040	5698480	you, but you can actually purchase these reports as well so that you can kind of get the dirt
5698480	5702800	on the other players that you're playing against.
5702800	5707680	And that's kind of strange, like I don't really have another word for that.
5707680	5708680	That's just...
5708680	5709680	I don't know.
5709680	5713720	Well, yeah, you of course sell it, take all that information and then sell it.
5713720	5715560	It's kind of shady, but...
5715560	5720320	It's kind of like them selling the cheats that were in the games, you know, cheats that
5720320	5725760	used to be just button presses, now you have to pay $2 to unlock and type stuff.
5725760	5727900	It's just...
5727900	5729760	It's such a desperate money grab.
5729760	5735480	I mean, seriously, you're becoming that desperate chick, EA.
5735480	5737280	Nobody likes a desperate chick.
5737280	5739000	Anything they can do, right?
5739000	5741080	Any place they can just get more money?
5741080	5743000	Stop being so obvious with it, though.
5743000	5748080	I mean, it wouldn't be such a big deal if you put out Madden for $30 and then did all
5748080	5749080	this stuff.
5749080	5752660	Because at least that way, if you don't want to participate in it, you're getting a really
5752660	5753660	good deal.
5753660	5757320	If you do want to participate in all this crap, then you may be spending a little bit
5757320	5758720	more than you would normally.
5758720	5759720	I don't know.
5759720	5761360	I mean, it's just...
5761360	5765280	There's no real benefit if you don't do it, I guess.
5765280	5766560	You know what I mean?
5766560	5771080	If you're going to charge me for online for used or whatever, then the real game...
5771080	5772080	I don't know.
5772080	5773600	But I guess since you're...
5773600	5776280	If you buy it, you knew it really doesn't affect you anyways.
5776280	5777840	But seriously, though, don't let it slide.
5777840	5779840	Never forget.
5779840	5784600	Alright, this is going to make you even more angry, you guys.
5784600	5790880	Apparently there is a draft, and it's not a law yet, this is just a draft that the Federal
5790880	5796160	Trade Commission here in the U.S. making this draft, they're making some proposals to Washington,
5796160	5802040	and apparently one of them is a 5% tax on consumer electronics.
5802040	5806600	Now some folks are calling this the iPad tax, but it's not just iPads, you guys.
5806600	5809000	It really should be just iPads, though.
5809000	5820160	iPads, iMacs, Zunes, DSs, 360s, laptops, digital cameras, I mean, basically Best Buy is fucked.
5820160	5823480	A lot of things you buy there are going to have a 5% tax on it.
5823480	5825040	They're just going to pass it on to the consumer.
5825040	5826800	But why are they doing this, folks?
5826800	5827800	Why?
5827800	5831960	Because it will generate $4 billion for the U.S. government, which it could then use to
5831960	5839280	subsidize failing media outlets like newspapers.
5839280	5840280	What?
5840280	5844680	Okay, instead of using that $4 billion to, I don't know, put a dent in the national debt,
5844680	5846400	let's blow it on more stupid shit.
5846400	5850000	Or hire back teachers that they had to fire this year, I mean, I realize that was more
5850000	5854120	of a state thing than a federal thing, but I mean, I can think of more better uses for
5854120	5855120	this.
5855120	5858680	I mean, wasn't there just a story, not that long ago, I remember reading it, maybe it
5858680	5865360	wasn't on this show, but about how the iPad is reinvigorating the old school media because
5865360	5869280	like a lot of these newspapers are coming out with editions for the iPad that they're
5869280	5872240	selling subscriptions to, and they're actually doing quite well.
5872240	5876800	And magazines are doing this too, like the iPad is becoming this new reading device.
5876800	5884720	It's kind of like, why do we need to save your archaic ass if you're not going to evolve?
5884720	5885720	It just doesn't make sense.
5885720	5891840	You know, again, it hasn't passed yet, but it's a dumb idea.
5891840	5893840	I just don't like what they're using the money for.
5893840	5896720	I think the money could go to the more, you know, important things.
5896720	5898880	Why do we have to bail out the news media?
5898880	5905160	I mean, they sell ads, they eat, they need to evolve and adopt to where their readers
5905160	5906160	are.
5906160	5907160	Can I get some of that money?
5907160	5915640	We're media, we're floundering, we haven't made a dime since this show began.
5915640	5918040	I want four billion dollars, wah.
5918040	5920360	It's just, it's stupid.
5920360	5922040	Stop bailing out companies.
5922040	5923040	Seriously.
5923040	5929100	Alright, well let's move on to a part of the show that needs no bailing out.
5929100	5933300	It's very popular here on The Orange Laundrao, and every week you guys come to know and love
5933300	5934300	this segment.
5934300	5937440	It is the classic game of the week.
5937440	5938440	Rob?
5938440	5939440	Yes.
5939440	5944360	I think that everyone's going to figure out what this game is when you play the opening.
5944360	5947960	Alright so then I, well let me just say though, every week, for those that maybe have never
5947960	5951280	listened to Orange Laundrao's radio before, every week Dark Soccer likes to go through
5951280	5956700	the vault, the classic video game vault, and pick out a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful
5956700	5961320	little bastards playing on the lawn, you need to go play this classic video game immediately.
5961320	5963320	Get off my lawn and play this game.
5963320	5964320	Exactly.
5964320	5968140	Maybe that's what we should rename this segment, get off my lawn and play this game.
5968140	5981600	Here is tonight's classic game of the week.
5981600	5985240	Now if you don't get what that is from that, you need to seriously crawl out from under
5985240	5991320	the rock you've been living under, and this is mostly dialogue, but yeah the game is Metal
5991320	5995520	Gear Solid.
5995520	6000640	And who said Barbie, whatever, anyway.
6000640	6008720	Metal Gear Solid, a stealth action game that was directed and written by the guy I used
6008720	6012760	to run into every year at E3, Hideo Kojima.
6012760	6021840	It first came out in 1998 for the Playstation, and it's actually the sequel to the MSX2,
6021840	6028160	Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake, not the one we got over here, the actual MSX version.
6028160	6030800	Wait, what in the actual hell is this video?
6030800	6034640	It's actually 3 hours and 20 minutes long, like people can do this on YouTube now?
6034640	6035880	That's the playthrough of the first half of the game.
6035880	6038120	I thought you were limited to 10 minutes.
6038120	6039120	In theory.
6039120	6040120	What?
6040120	6047160	I love the voice acting in this, and by the way, the guy who did Snake's voice was David
6047160	6052720	Hader and he also wrote the first two X-Men movies, which is why they were good.
6052720	6059840	And the third one, Blue, he had written the third one, it would have been good.
6059840	6067000	So this is the one that brought Metal Gear up to the current generation of gamers.
6067000	6076360	Basically he's going in and stopping a group called Foxhound, which was his old unit, has
6076360	6087080	to liberate some hostages and basically stop them from, well, blowing up the earth, I guess.
6087080	6088080	Creating...
6088080	6090720	Man, I hate it when people try to blow up the earth.
6090720	6093760	Let's play Thermonuclear War.
6093760	6102120	So yeah, it has amazing voice acting, and even with the limitations of the visuals back
6102120	6109080	in the day, they really did a good job in covering up the things that would have been
6109080	6114080	harder to show, like blurring the face a little bit, smoothing a line here or there.
6114080	6117160	It really did look very good for its day.
6117160	6123480	You could get all kinds of bonus stuff to use in the game, because it's on-site weapons
6123480	6128200	procurement is how it's played, like the old ones.
6128200	6134320	You can also get infrared goggles and a cardboard box, and he smuggles his cigarettes in through
6134320	6135320	his stomach.
6135320	6139320	Does that mean that he barfs up his cigarettes as soon as he lands?
6139320	6140320	Perhaps.
6140320	6141320	I don't know.
6141320	6142320	Yeah.
6142320	6144680	Actually, you have to use the cigarettes to get through a couple of stages too.
6144680	6147320	I think that's funny.
6147320	6153120	There are, as you can tell from listening to all the speaking in the background, lots
6153120	6159160	of cut scenes and conversations, the game is very dialogue-heavy.
6159160	6164880	But on the plus side, it's very good voice acting, why don't you turn it up a little
6164880	6165880	bit?
6165880	6168520	Unfortunately, it's a little bit quiet, but here you go.
6168520	6172080	Oh, that's when he's about to land, so...
6172080	6173560	There's no voice acting, right?
6173560	6179180	There's some in a second, because we're at the part where he breaks through the water,
6179180	6183240	and that's the start menu of the game.
6183240	6187160	Well, what we can do when we get school.
6187160	6188160	I love the music of this game.
6188160	6189160	I actually have the soundtrack.
6189160	6192520	I have the soundtrack to all the Metal Gear Solid games.
6192520	6196760	And I also pick up all the art books for Dan every year.
6196760	6204400	At any rate, the whole first part of the game is to teach you the whole stealth part of
6204400	6208260	the game, and once you get the stealth down, you can actually go through the whole game
6208260	6211360	for the most part without killing people.
6211360	6215920	You get bonuses, I think, for the fewer that you kill.
6215920	6222560	But you also have to sort of maintain a working knowledge of how the entire facility is laid
6222560	6227240	out as you go through it, because you have to run back through it part of the way.
6227240	6230600	The characters that you have in this one is...
6230600	6232560	I think this is funny.
6232560	6238440	The character designer said that Solid Snake's physique was based off Jean-Claude Van Damme,
6238440	6241840	but his face was based off of Christopher Walken.
6241840	6242840	I don't see that.
6242840	6248200	I think he's a little bit better looking than Christopher Walken.
6248200	6254640	So you've got Roy Campbell, who is his former CEO, and then you have Master Miller, and
6254640	6261280	Mei Ling, and Naomi Hunter, and Natasha Romanenko, who is a weapons person.
6261280	6267560	But you also get Otacon, later on, who is named after the convention.
6267560	6268560	Here's some voice acting.
6268560	6270600	The elevator in the back is the only way up.
6270600	6271600	Just as I expected.
6271600	6276440	You'll have to take the elevator to the surface, but make sure nobody sees you.
6276440	6279440	If you need to, contact me by codec.
6279440	6283560	The frequency is 140.85.
6283560	6286440	When you want to use the codec, push the select button.
6286440	6289680	When we need to contact you, the codec will be...
6289680	6290680	There you go.
6290680	6292800	That's the other thing I was going to bring up.
6292800	6297440	This game totally breaks the fourth wall all the time.
6297440	6305960	First of all, when you run into one of the other hostages, he tells you about a soldier
6305960	6311160	that Snake ran into earlier, who ends up being Meryl, said, yeah, you can contact her on
6311160	6312160	codec.
6312160	6313160	Oh, I remember.
6313160	6316000	Her number is on the back of the CD case.
6316000	6317440	Nice.
6317440	6324840	And then when you fight Psycho Mantis, who is this telepathic telekinetic type of dude,
6324840	6330240	he proves his psychic powers for you by telling you to put your controller on the floor, and
6330240	6335120	then making the vibrate function go off to make it move.
6335120	6340760	And then he reads your memory card, and at the time he was reading games that Konami
6340760	6343480	hadn't put out yet.
6343480	6350440	So if you've got Xenogears later, it says, I see you like Xenogears.
6350440	6354400	I think I even had a Japanese game on there and it recognized it.
6354400	6355920	Go Fig.
6355920	6359600	So yeah, but I mean, this is like the major Konami games at the time.
6359600	6366760	But anyway, you go through the game and you've got this ninja that follows you around.
6366760	6374400	And he's Gray Fox, which I think he was in the second Metal Gear game, the MSX one.
6374400	6379300	So yeah, you go through the game, you get to see Metal Gear Rex, and oh yeah, you also
6379300	6386240	have an informant called Deep Throat, which I thought was a kind of neat nod towards,
6386240	6389880	well, you know, that there was an actual Deep Throat.
6389880	6390880	Towards the one in the Lovelace?
6390880	6391880	Oh, oh, sorry.
6391880	6392880	No.
6392880	6393880	The actual, yeah, no, I know.
6393880	6394880	Of course, I know.
6394880	6395880	Finally.
6395880	6396880	Oh, yeah.
6396880	6397880	That's right.
6397880	6398880	Like right before he died, right?
6398880	6399880	Yeah.
6399880	6400880	Yeah.
6400880	6401880	You know, I think he was declassified at the time.
6401880	6402880	Mm hmm.
6402880	6407920	So, um, man, that, that's something else though, being able to hold a secret that long, you
6407920	6408920	know?
6408920	6416440	Um, anyway, um, you go through the game, you have an epic battle with, uh, um, Liquid Snake,
6416440	6421320	who is the, uh, antagonist and, uh, Solid Snake's twin.
6421320	6426760	And you also have two endings based on what you do during the torture sequence.
6426760	6429680	One of them, Meryl, gets to live.
6429680	6432280	The other one, Meryl, dies.
6432280	6433280	Aw.
6433280	6435680	And there's my favorite question in the whole game.
6435680	6442280	Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on the battlefield?
6442280	6445880	Why does love always feel like a battlefield?
6445880	6446880	Battlefield.
6446880	6447880	Battlefield.
6447880	6455920	Also, um, for tie-ins, and I know I've brought up police knots before, um, uh, Meryl was
6455920	6467820	a character in, um, police knots, so she was included, um, and then, um, there's, uh, references
6467820	6471240	to, uh, Metal Gear in police knots.
6471240	6477080	And actually, I think scenes from police knots that go through when, um, Otacon is talking
6477080	6485200	about being a big geek, basically, he's a big Otaco, um, he pees himself too.
6485200	6490080	The first time you meet him, seriously, he backs into a corner and pisses himself.
6490080	6491080	Hello LP joke.
6491080	6494080	I know, right.
6494080	6501200	Um, and there's also, um, preliminary, um, artwork that was an easter egg for police
6501200	6505320	knots, um, pilot disc for the 3DO, which I think didn't come out, actually.
6505320	6509760	Um, so yeah, there are, there were, um, some side stories.
6509760	6518120	There was, um, Metal Gear Solid Integral, um, which, um, is based off of the expanded
6518120	6525200	Japanese version, except, um, it had, um, a VR mode with it.
6525200	6530320	We got the VR missions as a separate disc, um, but it had, like, a PS, uh, you remember
6530320	6533280	the, um, pocket station, Rob?
6533280	6534280	I do.
6534280	6541880	It had a pocket station minigame, um, you could, uh, uh, call the codec frequency and
6541880	6546680	get commentary from the staff, and you had a first person, first person, first person
6546680	6547680	mode.
6547680	6553440	And then after, and then there was also, um, Metal Gear Solid the Twin Snakes, which came
6553440	6555880	out on GameCube.
6555880	6562600	And also one that people may not be familiar with, the Bleem version, for Bleemcast, which
6562600	6567200	basically, it ran it through with the Dreamcast superior rendering capabilities, and it was
6567200	6568200	really nice.
6568200	6569200	I've got it.
6569200	6575920	It, I mean, I, I, I totally suggest everyone look up, um, Bleem for Dreamcast, Metal Gear
6575920	6579560	Solid, and then compare them side by side, it really is my thing.
6579560	6590200	Um, the soundtrack was amazing, it was done by, um, Rika Muranaka, and, um, uh, well actually,
6590200	6597760	the ending song was done by her, and it's, um, also sung in Irish, um, for the, uh, for
6597760	6598760	the ending.
6598760	6599760	I thought it was funny.
6599760	6600760	I'm gay like I should say.
6600760	6606240	Um, so yeah, from there we got all kinds of others, we got digital comics, we got a graphic
6606240	6611200	novel, and then, um, of course, there were all of the sequels.
6611200	6619640	Metal Gear Solid 2 The Avengers of Raiden Running Around Naked, um, did you ever play
6619640	6621720	that one?
6621720	6622720	Which one?
6622720	6623720	The second one?
6623720	6625600	Um, a very little, very, very little.
6625600	6632640	It was Metal Gear, it was, uh, Sons of Liberty, where Snake is in there calling himself Iroquois
6632640	6633640	Pliskin.
6633640	6634640	Mm-hmm.
6634640	6638760	You know, Pliskin also from Snake, Pliskin, yeah.
6638760	6643960	And then Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, where he is actually playing as Naked Snake, who
6643960	6645760	turns out to be Big Boss.
6645760	6646760	Spoiler!
6646760	6649120	Ooh, where have you been?
6649120	6653800	And then, uh, Metal Gear Solid 4, uh, Guns of the Patriots.
6653800	6658480	And then, of course, there's Metal Gear Solid Rising, uh, coming out, which is supposed
6658480	6662920	to, I think, feature Raiden, who is running around naked boy.
6662920	6665360	Good times?
6665360	6666640	I love her.
6666640	6667640	In the game.
6667640	6668640	What's wrong?
6668640	6669640	Nothing.
6669640	6677400	I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so... cute.
6677400	6678800	You're just flattering me.
6678800	6679800	No, I'm serious.
6679800	6683600	Well, I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.
6683600	6684600	Come on.
6684600	6688080	I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake.
6688080	6690480	But, uh, I'm surprised.
6690480	6691480	Yeah.
6691480	6697960	Anyway, um, if you keep talking to her, she'll give you, like, a little parable or a little
6697960	6699480	phrase, you know what I mean?
6699480	6701320	She's basically your fortune cookie throughout the game.
6701320	6705880	But if you keep calling her, she'll eventually just get mad at you, and her answer will be
6705880	6709720	dot, dot, dot, and she'll have this big frowny face.
6709720	6712320	And then, um, there's another...
6712320	6715800	I think it was in, um, the second one?
6715800	6719480	Or was it in the first one where you're in the locker, and if you look at the picture
6719480	6724240	of, like, the girl that he... and then call someone on the codec, it sounds like he's
6724240	6725240	jerking off.
6725240	6726240	Yeah.
6726240	6727240	Okay.
6727240	6728240	Yeah.
6728240	6730280	There's Easter eggs in this game.
6730280	6734280	It was like, Otacon tells him, we don't have time for that, Snake.
6734280	6735920	That was the second one.
6735920	6738600	He's like, we don't have time for that, Snake.
6738600	6740720	And he's just got the O face.
6740720	6741720	It's funny.
6741720	6742720	So, yeah.
6742720	6743720	Ew.
6743720	6745520	I think I know a little bit too much about the Metal Gear games.
6745520	6746520	You sure do.
6746520	6747520	Alright, but that's alright.
6747520	6749520	So, is that it for the wrap-up?
6749520	6750520	That's it.
6750520	6751520	Alright.
6751520	6752520	We gotta move on with the show.
6752520	6753520	Yeah, we do.
6753520	6756320	But that was a good... that was an epic Game of the Week there.
6756320	6757320	Epic.
6757320	6758920	I'm already losing my voice again.
6758920	6762720	Metal Gear Solid is your classic Game of the Week, and a true classic at that.
6762720	6763720	Yes.
6763720	6766640	So, we're gonna take a quick break so that we can rest our voices and all that fun stuff.
6766640	6767640	We will be back.
6767640	6768640	We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to go.
6768640	6770440	It's gonna be a long episode tonight, you guys.
6770440	6774160	We're gonna talk about a new game from the creator of Parappa the Rappa.
6774160	6775880	Possible upgrades of old PS2 titles.
6775880	6777360	Goldeneye could be making a comeback.
6777360	6780420	We're gonna talk all about that in Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
6780420	6781420	Don't go anywhere, folks.
6781420	6790200	We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6790200	6793360	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening.
6793360	6799280	June the 6th of 2010, where we are doing episode number 369 of our show.
6799280	6800280	69.
6800280	6802120	E3's just around the corner.
6802120	6805800	Of course, we've had a lot of news and rumors and stuff about what's coming up at E3.
6805800	6810000	Also, I think our show is taping live tonight while the MTV Movie Awards are going on, I
6810000	6812700	think is the big thing tonight.
6812700	6815240	And as to who's winning right now, I don't care.
6815240	6816920	I mean, are those awards relevant?
6816920	6817920	Do they actually mean anything?
6817920	6822600	Or is it just an excuse to get a bunch of celebrities together for ratings?
6822600	6823600	Uh...
6823600	6824600	Yeah.
6824600	6825600	Yeah.
6825600	6826600	That's pretty much how I feel, too.
6826600	6828960	All right, so let's get back into some gaming news, then.
6828960	6833920	Some things we care about around here, and some rapid, quick stories for you guys here
6833920	6838480	before we get back to some Twitter topics, which we're gonna get to in a moment, at twitter.com
6838480	6839480	slash O-L-R.
6839480	6842320	So you probably got, like, three minutes to get in your topics if you haven't yet.
6842320	6845720	In the meantime, let's do some rapid-fire news.
6845720	6851200	Well, the first of hopefully many pieces of download content for Reddit Redemption will
6851200	6852200	be coming out soon.
6852200	6860000	On June 22nd, Outlaws to the End will be adding some new content to the game.
6860000	6865120	Six online co-op missions for two to four players.
6865120	6873480	And also, they're gonna have some different, I don't know, different types of missions
6873480	6874480	in there.
6874480	6878600	Looks like one where you're escorting a raft, which is kinda cool.
6878600	6882400	And that'd be great, because I don't know about people that have played Reddit Redemption,
6882400	6887040	but the gang hideouts that you can actually play during free mode, I think we've gone
6887040	6889360	through all of those at least six times now.
6889360	6894640	It's getting old fast, and we need some more things to play.
6894640	6897760	So that would be awesome.
6897760	6904080	And of course, that is gonna be free on the 22nd.
6904080	6908760	Wii Party is gonna be one of the games that are gonna be showing off this year at Nintendo's
6908760	6910760	press conference.
6910760	6920440	And it's gonna feature 80-plus games, including some interesting ones, remote control hide-and-seek.
6920440	6921440	That's kinda cool.
6921440	6926360	I guess the players will hide their Wii remote somewhere in the room, and the other players
6926360	6931240	have to search for it by the sound coming from the controller's speaker.
6931240	6933160	Wow.
6933160	6934440	Groundbreaking and revolutionary.
6934440	6937200	I will give them props for being somewhat unique.
6937200	6940880	Some of the other games they were talking about called Wanwan Karuta.
6940880	6947160	Wouldn't it be funny if, like, you hid the thing too good, and then it's too far away
6947160	6950440	from the Wii to make a noise or whatever, so it gets lost forever?
6950440	6951440	That would be funny.
6951440	6953680	Sucker, gotta buy another $40 controller.
6953680	6959520	Wanwan Karuta is a game where the Wii remote will make a sound, and the players will have
6959520	6963960	to match the noise with an on-screen image, for example, an animal.
6963960	6969480	They also have a game called Sensitive Bomb, which players will pass a single remote to
6969480	6974080	one another without trying to jostle it too much to trigger the explosion.
6974080	6981000	So what you do is you pass that to another player, and then you push them.
6981000	6984900	That's playing with power.
6984900	6990440	And that'll be, of course, shown at the press conference on June 15th.
6990440	6991440	Some other fun stuff.
6991440	6995200	Will Reggie Fils-Aime come out and try to blow somebody up and push them and all that
6995200	6996200	stuff, you think?
6996200	7002300	He won't, because he's probably endorsing family play that's not destructive like that.
7002300	7005000	I don't give a shit.
7005000	7008880	There are no rules in Wii parking.
7008880	7014920	Connex is apparently teaming up with Nintendo to make some Mario Kart toys, and this is
7014920	7021000	supposed to be happening sometime in 2011, but that is awesome that you can make toys
7021000	7026820	based on Mario Kart and Connex, because, you know what, hey, if it's not Lego, it's Connex,
7026820	7031440	so that would be fun.
7031440	7038040	I would love to have Lego or Connex toys based on the Mario stuff.
7038040	7043360	So Salacious Pop is keeping us updated in chat on the MTV Movie Awards.
7043360	7044960	Here's why you're glad you're not watching.
7044960	7046200	You ready for this?
7046200	7050560	Best Female Performance, Kristen Stewart in Twilight, New Moon.
7050560	7054120	Best Male Performance, Robert Pattinson in Twilight, New Moon.
7054120	7059480	We're clearly not the demographic for- Best Movie, The Twilight Saga, New Moon.
7059480	7062960	We are not the demographic for MTV anymore.
7062960	7066120	You have to understand.
7066120	7069380	The MTV we knew and loved is gone.
7069380	7070380	It's dead.
7070380	7071920	You know what Twilight needs?
7071920	7072920	Simon Belmont.
7072920	7074720	That's what Twilight needs.
7074720	7080400	Hey, going on to some quick fire news and some other stuff that's coming out.
7080400	7082620	Rock Band Weekly updates.
7082620	7084000	Deftones are coming out.
7084000	7085000	Whoop-de-doo.
7085000	7087960	Grown up in Sacramento, I've heard way too much Deftones.
7087960	7091320	Cherry Waves, Hole in the Earth, and Minerva, whoopee whoopee.
7091320	7095640	Individual songs, Boys Like Girls with a Great Escape, and Crown of Thorns with Rock Ready.
7095640	7098800	I will be buying none of those songs.
7098800	7099800	But maybe you're interested.
7099800	7102680	I too will be buying none of those songs.
7102680	7105340	Here's a game that might actually catch my interest.
7105340	7106580	Maybe I will buy this.
7106580	7109360	It's a game called Hardcore Uprising.
7109360	7112320	Hard Corps, but I think the P is silent when you say it like that.
7112320	7116840	Hardcore Uprising for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.
7116840	7118040	Why am I interested in this game?
7118040	7121520	Apparently it's a spiritual successor to Contra.
7121520	7122820	It plays like Contra.
7122820	7124080	It feels like Contra.
7124080	7125080	It's high def.
7125080	7126080	It's a side scroller.
7126080	7127080	It's guns.
7127080	7129760	It just doesn't have Contra in it.
7129760	7136200	But the game looks awesome because it's, you know, done by Axes, I think, or not Axes.
7136200	7141080	The people that did it are like BlazBlue, because it's all hand drawn stuff and looks
7141080	7142080	awesome.
7142080	7145440	Well, you might remember there was a Genesis game called Contra Hard Corps.
7145440	7149400	This is apparently a successor to that game, but for whatever reason, they've just decided
7149400	7150400	not to call it Contra.
7150400	7154500	I guess they just didn't want people to know what this game was.
7154500	7155500	So whatever.
7155500	7158240	It still looks cool.
7158240	7159240	There it is.
7159240	7160600	Uh, who is it?
7160600	7161600	Uh, let's see.
7161600	7163440	Yeah, Arc System Works apparently is doing this game.
7163440	7164440	Yes, Arc System Works.
7164440	7165440	That's what I was thinking.
7165440	7166440	There it is.
7166440	7168840	So it will be beautifully animated.
7168840	7170840	That's for sure.
7170840	7176360	Alright, also coming out, Earthworm Jim HD.
7176360	7178800	Apparently that is the big release next week.
7178800	7180680	Also some deals.
7180680	7182320	Worms 2 is getting a price reduction.
7182320	7184520	Kegel goes down to 400 points.
7184520	7186320	Duke Nukem 3D is down to 400 points.
7186320	7188400	I might have to finally pick that up.
7188400	7192080	So yeah, lots of good deals on Xbox Live next week, and of course, Earthworm Jim, or as
7192080	7194080	the intro says, Earthworm Jim.
7194080	7195240	You know, a little burping thing.
7195240	7198200	Uh, HD comes out on this Wednesday, June the 9th.
7198200	7200200	And that's going to be awesome, because you can play four-person co-op.
7200200	7201720	Yeah, four-person co-op.
7201720	7202720	That's right.
7202720	7204160	That'll be fun.
7204160	7205160	So there it is.
7205160	7210160	A couple of little stories about things coming out very soon on the downloadable platforms.
7210160	7211160	Dark Sakura.
7211160	7218440	In other news, Sony Online Entertainment is actually releasing some information about
7218440	7224160	PlayStation 3 and PC MMO for DC Universe Online.
7224160	7227440	But they really haven't said too much more about it.
7227440	7231480	There's no real release date, but they said that both versions will come out at the same
7231480	7232860	time.
7232860	7235920	It's likely to be in November.
7235920	7241320	Which actually is what they finally came out and said.
7241320	7243400	So that's cool, I guess.
7243400	7247720	I don't know how it'll play, but hey.
7247720	7256680	Also the voice actor, Phil Snyder, who we better know as the voice of Jiminy Cricket,
7256680	7263240	said that he's working on an unannounced project called Kingdom Hearts Recoded.
7263240	7277040	And said that that's likely a sequel to the mobile phone game, Kingdom Hearts Coded.
7277040	7282120	Could be a redrawn, you know, an upscaled version or ported too.
7282120	7283120	Could be.
7283120	7286080	You know, when you're going from mobile phone to PSP, you expect things are gonna be upgraded
7286080	7287640	quite a bit.
7287640	7289880	Not really.
7289880	7291120	I would hope so.
7291120	7293120	Could be an iPhone title.
7293120	7294440	Oh, that could be too.
7294440	7296680	I don't know how I feel about that.
7296680	7308360	And then we've had some more Sims titles, well, domains actually being registered by
7308360	7311440	corporate domains.
7311440	7324720	There are the Sims Medivial, or the Sims Get Medivial, so could possibly be old school
7324720	7332160	jousting Sims with chamber pots and chastity belts and tight lacing and lights.
7332160	7336960	What if they have it where you can design your castles and stuff like that?
7336960	7341520	Well, not that you can't design castles and add moats, cause hell, I was doing that in
7341520	7342520	Sims 1.
7342520	7343520	Well, the moats part.
7343520	7348920	And they've actually got out a Ren Faire set officially through the Sims store.
7348920	7355400	And then Mod The Sims, which is one of the mod sites I go through, they actually did
7355400	7358000	a Medivial challenge.
7358000	7360880	You know what piece of equipment they could put in a Sims Medivial game that would make
7360880	7361880	me buy it?
7361880	7362880	A guillotine.
7362880	7363880	With his head!
7363880	7370040	Yes, and then I could literally sit in the throne, or I'm sorry, my Sim could sit in
7370040	7371040	the throne in the house.
7371040	7372040	Off with his head!
7372040	7374240	And then you also need an Iron Maiden.
7374240	7375240	Yes.
7375240	7376240	Iron Maiden!
7376240	7377240	Excellent!
7377240	7378240	Execute them!
7378240	7379240	Bogus!
7379240	7380240	Wow.
7380240	7385240	Yes, I've seen that movie.
7385240	7386240	1987 called.
7386240	7387240	A lot.
7387240	7388240	It misses you.
7388240	7392240	Hey, I got it right.
7392240	7394320	Alright, never forget.
7394320	7396240	I am the Duke of Ted.
7396240	7397240	Never forget.
7397240	7400000	Dark Sakura is a frickin' nerd.
7400000	7401000	So?
7401000	7402000	Nerd.
7402000	7404360	That's why we love you, you nerd.
7404360	7405360	So?
7405360	7408320	Alright, so you're just a nerdy nerd.
7408320	7409320	That's all.
7409320	7415600	Alright, we're gonna get into a segment here on the show we like to call the Twitter Topics.
7415600	7417560	But I'm missing the theme music for Twitter Topics.
7417560	7419320	Can we do Twitter Topics with no theme music?
7419320	7420320	Can we?
7420320	7421320	I don't know.
7421320	7422320	Doo doo doo doo doo.
7422320	7423320	I don't know.
7423320	7424320	Do we have, like, music?
7424320	7425320	Are you gonna sing the theme music?
7425320	7426320	No, I'm not.
7426320	7427320	Alright.
7427320	7428320	Well, you're saved anyway.
7428320	7429320	I found it.
7429320	7430320	See?
7430320	7433160	It's what we call stretching for time while I look for stuff for Twitter Topics.
7433160	7435520	Not a lot of tweets tonight.
7435520	7438320	I'm frowning with disappointment at our listeners.
7438320	7441320	Here's my frown to all of you.
7441320	7443320	Alright.
7443320	7446760	Let's see.
7446760	7448680	Lots of plugs for articles on the website.
7448680	7450320	See, I got those in earlier.
7450320	7453480	Dr. Noir sent his condolences to the Golden Girl-loving crew.
7453480	7456680	Yeah, I guess we didn't really talk about this enough earlier in the show, but there
7456680	7458640	was a lot of celebrity death, obviously.
7458640	7461680	I don't buy the whole death comes in threes things.
7461680	7464760	I think people just look for coincidences wherever they want to.
7464760	7467480	Um, cause didn't, like, Art Link let her die, too?
7467480	7469040	And nobody cares about him, though.
7469040	7470040	So, whatever.
7470040	7471040	Who?
7471040	7472040	Well, I'm saying, you know.
7472040	7473040	And Gary Coleman.
7473040	7474040	Right.
7474040	7475040	Who technically does have a video game tie-in.
7475040	7477040	He was in Portal 2.
7477040	7479040	Or, Portal 2.
7479040	7480480	Postal 2.
7480480	7481720	Much different.
7481720	7483320	He still could be in Portal 2.
7483320	7488600	Or, importantly, he's in Avenue Q. And, um, uh...
7488600	7489600	Rue McClanahan, of course.
7489600	7490600	No, no, no, no.
7490600	7491600	The man.
7491600	7492600	Our zombie man.
7492600	7493600	Dennis Hopper.
7493600	7494600	Yeah.
7494600	7499600	I put on my Facebook that Dennis Hopper was going to come back as a zombie riding a motorcycle
7499600	7501600	cause, what, wasn't he an easy rider, or?
7501600	7502600	Yeah, he was.
7502600	7503600	He rode it, or something, didn't he?
7503600	7504600	Yeah.
7504600	7505600	Well, that's what I mean.
7505600	7508600	That was his big movie and all the Romero flicks.
7508600	7514040	But, um, my, I think my uncle added on there that Gary Coleman would be in the sidecar.
7514040	7516640	Alright, um, Tigerclaw sends us a link.
7516640	7519520	He sent us a lot of links, but some of them we're actually tackling a little later in
7519520	7520520	the show.
7520520	7521520	But I will use this one.
7521520	7525400	I think somebody had pulled this up and wanted us to use this to see if you, maybe, I think
7525400	7528240	you showed this to me earlier, Dark Soccer, but I'll go ahead and read it now.
7528240	7533520	Cause, um, Tigerclaw sent it in, but this is, this is straight up fucked up, you guys.
7533520	7535920	This is straight up fucked up.
7535920	7542640	Um, Predator used Call of Duty to coerce kids into sending nude pics.
7542640	7546360	I don't know how appropriate the stupid newborn music came on.
7546360	7547360	Here we go.
7547360	7553320	Um, a New Jersey man convinced four 13 and 14 year olds to send him pictures of their
7553320	7558320	genitals by saying that it was a membership condition of the clan he was starting in Call
7558320	7560160	of Duty World of War.
7560160	7564800	Jonathan Prime is 20 years old and faces four felony counts of communication with a minor
7564800	7566920	for immoral purposes.
7566920	7572120	He also has a previous conviction on a child porn charge related to this case in his home
7572120	7574680	state.
7574680	7579320	He's in jail on a $25,000 bond and all this stuff.
7579320	7585600	Just, kids, don't send pictures of your penis over Xbox Live ever.
7585600	7590320	And don't, he shouldn't really send pictures of your penis like anywhere.
7590320	7592360	And let me tell you why.
7592360	7598480	It gets bigger until, when do you stop growing like 23 or something?
7598480	7604080	I mean, just wait, wait until you're fully mature.
7604080	7605280	And it's gross.
7605280	7606280	Come on.
7606280	7607280	That's the real reason.
7607280	7608760	You don't do that.
7608760	7612000	Don't send pictures of your dongle over the internet.
7612000	7613560	All right.
7613560	7615200	Um, let's see.
7615200	7618920	Meow Frog sent us some tweets saying, first time listening to OLR live.
7618920	7619920	Well, welcome.
7619920	7621840	And ah, what's the chat for OLR?
7621840	7627480	Well, I saw Meow Frog in chat earlier, so I know they made it to chat, but it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com
7627480	7631640	for anyone else who is listening and wanting to know how to join us in our chat room.
7631640	7637080	Um, although if you ask in the All Games chat, um, they'll probably tell you how to get over
7637080	7638080	there too.
7638080	7639080	All right.
7639080	7640080	Um, let's see.
7640080	7644000	Uh, what else do we have?
7644000	7645000	That's about it.
7645000	7650400	Except Jay Jugo, and I hope I'm saying this right, Jay Jugo, uh, I hope it's not Hugo.
7650400	7654440	Jay Jugo says, uh, the never forget segment should be added to the show.
7654440	7655440	Never forget.
7655440	7659440	I'm just not sure how to make that like a piece of the show.
7659440	7660440	So I don't know.
7660440	7665200	Uh, Loomis sends us a tweet saying, OLR, will you be going to BlizzCon, Sky?
7665200	7666720	I would love to buy you a drink.
7666720	7667720	No homo.
7667720	7671200	Oh, I forgot about that saying.
7671200	7672200	Thank you.
7672200	7676640	Uh, well sadly, uh, homo or no homo, I'm not going to BlizzCon because I didn't know what
7676640	7680560	was justified, $150 for the tickets.
7680560	7685080	Um, so I didn't buy the tickets because I didn't know what I'd be paying for, except
7685080	7687960	that probably there's sneak peeks in new BlizzCon games.
7687960	7692760	However, Dark Soccer and I are, we're thinking about just going down to Anaheim anyway, if
7692760	7694280	finances will allow.
7694280	7696960	We'll go down to Anaheim anyway and just go to Disneyland.
7696960	7699840	It'll be called, uh, USCon.
7699840	7700840	Yes.
7700840	7703080	So you can buy us a drink there, I suppose.
7703080	7705080	No homo.
7705080	7712080	By, by the way, Rob, I had to, I had to describe to somebody what the difference between girly
7712080	7713080	and gay was.
7713080	7714080	Oh my gosh.
7714080	7715080	And decorating.
7715080	7720960	I, I don't, I, I just cannot even possibly understand.
7720960	7722460	All right.
7722460	7723460	That's it.
7723460	7724460	That's it for tweets.
7724460	7725460	We didn't get a lot of tweets tonight.
7725460	7727760	Well we got, I mean, Tiger class has other stories, there are things that are coming
7727760	7734320	up later, so you know, we appreciate his Google foo, but I don't want to spoil upcoming stories.
7734320	7736440	All right.
7736440	7739240	How about some other topics we want to talk about tonight?
7739240	7740240	Loki.
7740240	7741240	Yes.
7741240	7745640	Let's talk about how Parappa the Rapper, um, well, the creator of Parappa the Rapper is
7745640	7749640	putting out a new music game for the iPhone and iPod.
7749640	7752440	Um, it looks interesting, I guess.
7752440	7759900	It's called, uh, it looks like Winta or War is Not the Answer.
7759900	7763040	And it's, um,
7763040	7764560	What is it good for?
7764560	7766600	What is it good for?
7766600	7767600	Butter.
7767600	7768600	Uh, yeah.
7768600	7779080	They didn't really say, uh, what exactly the game, um, is going to be like, but it's basically
7779080	7782540	tapping squares on the screen to time with music.
7782540	7788360	So kind of looks a little bit like it could be, um, you know, similar to like Lead Beat
7788360	7789520	Agents or something like that.
7789520	7790520	Well I mean, Coolin' All.
7790520	7792480	Is the art done by Mr. Greenblatt?
7792480	7793480	It's just squares.
7793480	7794480	Yeah.
7794480	7795480	The art could have been done by anybody.
7795480	7796480	Here's the thing.
7796480	7799640	I get all excited when I hear it's the Parappa the Rapper dude, and then I'm like, oh, it's
7799640	7803220	just like neon squares that I push with my finger.
7803220	7804220	This sounds riveting.
7804220	7809920	I mean, I guess if the music's cool, then it's worth checking out, but come on.
7809920	7814360	How about a new like actual like Parappa or Umjama Lamy type game?
7814360	7818960	I mean, tell me that like Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, I suppose more appropriately, would
7818960	7821800	not be like the perfect platform for a game like that.
7821800	7822800	Come on.
7822800	7823800	Yeah.
7823800	7824800	It'd be cool.
7824800	7825800	It'd be awesome.
7825800	7826800	You got to believe.
7826800	7827800	Never going to happen.
7827800	7833680	By the way, the butter, you know, that comes from cheap, cheap, cheap level.
7833680	7839120	We used to just for months, Dan and I would go around going crack, crack, butter.
7839120	7841960	So he laughed in the other room.
7841960	7844280	I feel happy.
7844280	7848620	And Derek H took my question literally saying a war saved us from the Nazis and war freed
7848620	7849620	the slaves.
7849620	7852760	I was singing a song, I don't forget it.
7852760	7853760	It's all right.
7853760	7858480	All right, moving on.
7858480	7864640	Could Sony possibly be possibly be planning more PS2 remakes?
7864640	7868160	For example, you know, they did the God of War remakes earlier.
7868160	7869560	Well, guess what?
7869560	7871560	It's a survey going around again.
7871560	7872560	Yep.
7872560	7873560	That's right.
7873560	7875200	The surveys sometimes leak things that Sony are thinking.
7875200	7876200	Survey says.
7876200	7880720	Oh, you didn't see that joke coming.
7880720	7881720	One of the things on the survey.
7881720	7885760	Well, the survey said, what titles would you like to see in a future collection?
7885760	7891440	Two or more PS2 titles upgraded with similar features to God of War collection.
7891440	7895120	And I like this because there's this little screen shot that shows like Shadow of the
7895120	7901760	Colossus, Ico, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, Yakuza, Silent Hill, like just every single
7901760	7904300	freaking franchise is being listed in there.
7904300	7908160	But I guess it's kind of cool that they're going back and thinking about doing that.
7908160	7909160	But you know what?
7909160	7911720	Show me Twisted Metal.
7911720	7913280	You know, Metal Gear.
7913280	7917360	You know, what's interesting about this, though, is that they're asking about what do you want
7917360	7922480	to see upgraded and not just like what backwards compatibility would you like to have on your
7922480	7924200	PS3?
7924200	7928320	You know, I realize, yes, there's that first generation of consoles that does have it,
7928320	7932080	but most of us don't have a better console and we all figured that they would end up
7932080	7933520	selling it at some point.
7933520	7938120	But I don't know, like I feel like there's there's something missing here.
7938120	7942640	Yes, I'm one of those douchebags that has the fully backwards compatible system and
7942640	7944800	doesn't play any PlayStation 2 games on it.
7944800	7945800	Douchebag.
7945800	7950200	You want to trade PS3s because I could sort of play like Final Fantasy 12.
7950200	7951840	No.
7951840	7954960	Did you ever upgrade your PS3 to lose the other OS feature?
7954960	7955960	Nope.
7955960	7956960	You're still holding out, huh?
7956960	7957960	Still holding out.
7957960	7963040	Haven't played 3D Dot Game Heroes 2 because that would upgrade my system.
7963040	7964320	So I'm loading it to a friend.
7964320	7969760	ToaGak in our chat room says, very eloquently, fuck PS2 remakes.
7969760	7971720	I mean, are they necessary?
7971720	7974080	I mean, maybe he's posing a good question there.
7974080	7975080	Is this really necessary?
7975080	7976080	No.
7976080	7977900	Well, the God of War collection was pretty cool, though.
7977900	7982020	I mean, HD, widescreen, sexy.
7982020	7983020	Come on.
7983020	7984020	It was kind of cool.
7984020	7985020	Right?
7985020	7990520	It'd be kind of cool if the system did that on its own, but it kind of doesn't.
7990520	7995080	Derek H. says, if they redo Gran Turismo 2, people will realize it has more cars and tracks
7995080	7998000	than GT5.
7998000	7999000	Might be a good point.
7999000	8002280	Maybe they don't want us to go back and play some of those old games.
8002280	8004040	I don't know.
8004040	8007320	DarkTet Suvia thinks you should be a game show host, by the way.
8007320	8008320	Me?
8008320	8009320	Yeah.
8009320	8010320	Why?
8010320	8011320	I don't know.
8011320	8012320	Maybe he liked your survey says.
8012320	8013320	Survey says?
8013320	8014320	Survey says.
8014320	8015320	You should do a game show about porn.
8015320	8017520	I could see you doing that.
8017520	8020320	Wheel of porn.
8020320	8021320	Remember way back in the day?
8021320	8022840	Let me give you an OLR flashback.
8022840	8023840	Never forget.
8023840	8026120	This is many, many, many, many, many years ago in the OLR history.
8026120	8028440	It was probably in the first or second year of OLR.
8028440	8029440	Never forget.
8029440	8037440	Loki hosted a competition, and the competition was called Make Edit Get Porn.
8037440	8040240	I got second place in that, didn't I?
8040240	8041240	I don't remember as long as I'm good.
8041240	8042240	I placed in it.
8042240	8043240	I know I did.
8043240	8044560	I think you and I both placed.
8044560	8049400	But this was where basically you would make an edit to a DDR song, because back in the
8049400	8053040	day you could make edits in the home version of DDR and put them in the machines.
8053040	8057080	And Loki's favorite edits would receive a free gift of pornography.
8057080	8058280	We did the hell edits.
8058280	8059280	That's right.
8059280	8060960	And it was called Make Edit Get Porn.
8060960	8062720	It was the best contest the stations ever had.
8062720	8065320	I did the DXY version called Another.
8065320	8073800	I think I did one to kick the can called Big Cans.
8073800	8075240	I think that was it.
8075240	8077640	And then there was the one with the big gap in the middle that you could run around all
8077640	8080360	over the arcade and then come back in time to finish it.
8080360	8081360	Yes.
8081360	8082360	That was fun.
8082360	8083360	Good times.
8083360	8087480	Yeah, so I don't know how we got from PS2 titles to make edit get porn, but there you
8087480	8088480	go.
8088480	8091080	I got all that Excel saga in the hell edit contest.
8091080	8092080	That was it.
8092080	8093080	That's right.
8093080	8095680	A lot of the porn was actually softcore Skidamax porn, but it was still...
8095680	8096680	It was not good stuff.
8096680	8097680	No, it was...
8097680	8099600	Well, there was a reason why Loki was giving away...
8099600	8100600	The winner...
8100600	8101600	Whatever happened to Dave?
8101600	8102600	Whatever happened to him?
8102600	8103600	He got two boxes.
8103600	8109520	Boxes of like 60 titles in there.
8109520	8110800	Boxes of porn.
8110800	8114320	He took it home and we never heard from him again.
8114320	8115320	Exactly.
8115320	8116320	Oh my God.
8116320	8117320	Is he still alive?
8117320	8118320	We need to...
8118320	8119320	That, that, that.
8119320	8122120	Or is he still fapping right now?
8122120	8123120	I don't know.
8123120	8124120	All right.
8124120	8125120	Moving on.
8125120	8126120	Dark Sakura.
8126120	8127120	What you got for us?
8127120	8128120	More news.
8128120	8129120	Yeah.
8129120	8130120	More news.
8130120	8133040	Although Robin Gaughan is going to have to ask you your help with the mailbag today.
8133040	8134040	Dark Tetsuya is pointing out...
8134040	8135040	That's fine.
8135040	8136040	I'll do me a mic.
8136040	8138440	Dark Tetsuya is pointing out that, uh, that highlight is on the best hits that you can
8138440	8141940	download at orangelaundry.com.
8141940	8143640	So check it.
8143640	8150280	Well, um, there is, um, something about Activision working on a golden eye title for the Wii
8150280	8153640	and the DS to be released in November.
8153640	8159600	And it's theorized to be, um, a remake of the Nintendo 64 version that Rare put out.
8159600	8163440	I'm going to actually just interrupt you real quick because our stream actually just went
8163440	8165640	down while you were reading the beginning of that story.
8165640	8166640	Well, crap.
8166640	8167640	We had a little bork in the feed.
8167640	8168640	I don't know what happened.
8168640	8169640	It went down.
8169640	8171560	But I do show we are reconnected right now.
8171560	8175360	It's still recording for the podcast anyway, so I apologize, but we're going to do just
8175360	8176820	like a live take two.
8176820	8179840	So Dark Sakura, would you start in again with that lovely story while people reconnect?
8179840	8182120	And here I was using my porn voice.
8182120	8183120	Anyway.
8183120	8184960	Oh man, you guys missed it.
8184960	8185960	It was so hot.
8185960	8188960	No, I'm just kidding.
8188960	8196080	So, Activision is working on a James Bond game, a golden eye title, Rob.
8196080	8200720	And it's supposed to be out for Wii and the DS, um, in theory released in November.
8200720	8206480	Uh, one of the, uh, going rumors about it is that it will be a remake of the Nintendo
8206480	8211200	64 version, which as we all know is epic, classic, the game.
8211200	8214120	The game made me sick.
8214120	8215120	Sick to my stomach.
8215120	8218840	Perfect Dark was redone recently and it was pretty, pretty awesome.
8218840	8219840	That's true.
8219840	8227440	Um, but, um, Activision basically let it off, um, at the point that they registered domain
8227440	8231000	names that were named after the film.
8231000	8238000	So we might see that coming and, you know, they also did work on, um, The World Is Not
8238000	8241000	Enough, right?
8241000	8244880	Uh, they've done the last few Bond films.
8244880	8248680	They have, you know, the rights to do the games for them.
8248680	8255080	So, I mean, if they bring us out and if they bring us out a remade golden eye, that will
8255080	8256080	be pretty hot.
8256080	8257080	That's going to be fun.
8257080	8258080	But you know what?
8258080	8259400	I don't think it'll be as good as the original.
8259400	8260400	That's just the problem.
8260400	8262040	You know, nothing is really as ever good as the original.
8262040	8265120	I don't think anything's going to accurately capture the magic of the original.
8265120	8272680	Well, I beg to differ, because as I said in part A, when Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes
8272680	8277680	came out on the GameCube, it was a fairly kick ass version.
8277680	8284640	And don't forget the Resident Evil update, where they did Resident Evil on GameCube,
8284640	8285640	and it was really hot.
8285640	8287320	Alright, I'll give you that.
8287320	8289400	There have been remakes done right.
8289400	8290400	Alright, we'll see.
8290400	8293640	They just have to make sure to stick with the essence of the game.
8293640	8294640	Alright.
8294640	8298800	I do want to remind folks, sometimes we can't control the downtime of the feed.
8298800	8302440	There's just random hiccups, although I like this comment from SSJ100Matt.
8302440	8306720	Speaking of porn, who's watching it in studio, he said right as the feed went down.
8306720	8308840	Not me.
8308840	8309840	It's comcastic.
8309840	8310840	What can I say?
8310840	8312320	It happens sometimes.
8312320	8317000	Anyhow, let's move on with a few more news stories, then we're going to get to the mailbag.
8317000	8320440	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, we answer your emails live, on air.
8320440	8321440	Good times.
8321440	8322440	Loki.
8322440	8326720	Grand Theft Horse, awesome.
8326720	8333760	So apparently there's been some ratings that have leaked up from the Korean ratings board,
8333760	8337720	and these are some Dreamcast titles that are going to be ported to Xbox Live Arcade.
8337720	8344280	Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi, they have been submitted for ratings, and of course
8344280	8348600	Sega was unable to officially comment on the ratings.
8348600	8355400	But Sonic Adventure has popped up before, I guess they had some screenshots leak out
8355400	8361200	a little bit ago, and Crazy Taxi, I think the same thing.
8361200	8365880	Not that I know or anything, but Sonic Adventure is most definitely real.
8365880	8368400	Crazy Taxi is probably the same.
8368400	8373200	I would not be surprised if these get announced at E3.
8373200	8376280	Do you think there's a chance they're going to come out and say, and they're out today!
8376280	8377280	Because that happens once in a while.
8377280	8380120	Sonic Adventure is done, so yeah, I can see that.
8380120	8381120	You can see that happening.
8381120	8382120	It's been done for a while.
8382120	8383120	Definitely can see that happening, huh?
8383120	8388000	Same as Sonic 4, but they're taking their damn time.
8388000	8392240	Well, let's move on with some more news, and then I guess I'm going to do the mailbag tonight.
8392240	8394120	Dark Sakura is not feeling up to it.
8394120	8395120	No, that's fine.
8395120	8397120	My voice has finally decided to crap out.
8397120	8398120	Alright, that's fine.
8398120	8402520	But I'll talk about this, and maybe this is the perk up that Dark Sakura needs, because
8402520	8403520	this will be fun.
8403520	8405880	There's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
8405880	8412680	It's from Ubisoft, the makers of Let's Dance, and it's called Dance on Broadway.
8412680	8415680	That's right, 20 songs from Broadway musicals.
8415680	8418560	Dude, what's in it?
8418560	8428040	All That Jazz, Roxy, Cabaret, Money Money, Dream Girls, One Night Only, Luck Be a Lady,
8428040	8432840	We're in the Money, Lullaby of Broadway, You Can't Stop the Beat, Good Morning Baltimore,
8432840	8445240	Fame, My Favorite Things, Bend and Snap, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Little Shop of Horrors, Aquarius,
8445240	8454920	Let the Sun Shine In, and, and, and, and, The Time Warp, Dark Sakura's making woo-face
8454920	8457920	right now, but you can't hear her.
8457920	8462080	I already know how to do The Time Warp, it's just a jump to the left, and then a step to
8462080	8463080	the right.
8463080	8465240	But this is supposed to be like Just Dance.
8465240	8467640	It's pretty much a sequel to Just Dance, right?
8467640	8470800	Yeah, except they're going to have Just Dance too, so.
8470800	8474400	Well, it's like Guitar Hero 80s edition.
8474400	8480480	It's Just Dance, super duper gay edition, and that's okay.
8480480	8481880	There's nothing wrong with that.
8481880	8486840	This actually reminds me that people need to stay tuned for Cage Match tonight, speaking
8486840	8487840	of show tunes.
8487840	8489880	Oh heavens, why is that?
8489880	8493080	Speaking of show tunes, that's all.
8493080	8496760	By the way, for those of you guys that have never listened live before, you should tune
8496760	8500160	in, because we do some extra stuff live that we don't do on the podcast, just a little
8500160	8503900	bit, nothing too much, we don't want to leave our podcasties in the dark, but there's certain
8503900	8508920	things we can do live that we can't do on the podcast, like play copyright music, so,
8508920	8513960	you know, and clips of extended things, so do listen live sometime.
8513960	8518440	Anyhow, in the meantime, we're going to do something we can do on the podcast and live,
8518440	8530160	we love to do this segment every week, it is the mailbag.
8530160	8534000	Next link in our chatroom says, nothing from Wicked, fail.
8534000	8535800	No, I actually don't like Wicked.
8535800	8536800	Really?
8536800	8537800	Oh my gosh.
8537800	8540240	Well, no, because I read the book.
8540240	8546440	I can't listen to this as a musical, because the book was so dark and gorgeous.
8546440	8550620	Alright, let's see the emails, because there's a lot tonight, because we kind of have a backlog
8550620	8554800	from all the shows that we didn't do the past couple weeks, so I'm going to start off tonight
8554800	8562000	with this one from, oh, that's a spam email that came in.
8562000	8568600	Let's do, I don't see a name on that one, let's try this one instead.
8568600	8572760	Let's do, and I'm not going to be able to get to all the emails tonight, because there's
8572760	8576480	so many guys, sorry guys, Redertainment.
8576480	8580640	Dear OLR, I was listening to your midweek discussion of the inclusion of a keytar in
8580640	8583400	the next Rock Band game, and a thought came to my mind.
8583400	8587060	If this keytar is a plastic instrument with the keys on the body instead of the neck,
8587060	8590220	isn't that like playing the plastic guitar backward?
8590220	8594640	I don't mean playing it left-handed, but playing the guitar turned 180 degrees with the keys
8594640	8595640	on your lap?
8595640	8601680	Also, it seems to me that every numbered version of Rock Band gives the gaming public another
8601680	8605820	gaming-related plastic dust magnet that is incompatible with other games, but gamers
8605820	8608320	feel compelled by to play the game.
8608320	8613360	Rock Band gave us a guitar, Rock Band 2 gave us a complete band set, Rock Band 3 will give
8613360	8615200	us a keytar.
8615200	8618000	That makes me wonder, I know, hold on, we got a correction there.
8618000	8621760	That makes me wonder what useless plastic space hog Rock Band 4 will bring us.
8621760	8624200	I vote for maracas, wait.
8624200	8627620	Actually, one small correction to your email, dude, I get what you're saying, but here's
8627620	8633380	the thing, Rock Band, think of the name, Rock Band, it actually was the full set.
8633380	8637880	Rock Band was the guitar, drum, and microphone, even in the first game.
8637880	8642000	Here's where you might be getting confused, because Harmonix did originally make Guitar
8642000	8646960	Hero, which was just the guitar, but you might remember they relinquished control of that
8646960	8651300	to Activision, or Activision took control back, whatever, and made Neversoft make Guitar
8651300	8655520	Hero 3, and that's the year that Rock Band also came out.
8655520	8658720	So that might be where your confusion's coming from.
8658720	8663160	Nevertheless, I get what you're saying, but I kind of forgive them, because they're not
8663160	8664720	doing a new game every year.
8664720	8668460	I mean, yes, there was Beatles, yes, there was Green Day, but it's been a little while
8668460	8670140	since Rock Band 2 now.
8670140	8674720	So if it's one more plastic instrument to put in my house after two years, eh, I'm okay
8674720	8679240	with it, especially if they are selling this in the configuration where I only have to
8679240	8683960	buy the one instrument and the game, because all my other old-ass instruments still work.
8683960	8688240	My Guitar Hero 2 guitar still works, and it's fine.
8688240	8691720	So there you go.
8691720	8699080	Our good buddy Rob with two B's, Rob-a-ba-ba-ba, sends us some impressions on Prince of Persia.
8699080	8703520	Says, my boyfriend is a non-gamer, but he really enjoyed the Prince of Persia, The Sands
8703520	8704520	of Time.
8704520	8705840	I thought it was fun to watch, too.
8705840	8710540	The criticism that Jake Gyllenhaal was too Caucasian for the role were unfounded.
8710540	8714280	That's because the other two princes in the movie were whiter.
8714280	8715880	Funny.
8715880	8721360	Again, another thing I'm surprised I'm not hearing a lot of comment on this week.
8721360	8723120	Loki, did you happen to see the movie?
8723120	8724120	No.
8724120	8725880	I didn't bother either.
8725880	8733040	The only movie I watched this week is not out yet, so obviously not legally.
8733040	8734720	But it was a good movie!
8734720	8737680	And hopefully it will come out over here at some point, but it's just not yet.
8737680	8742520	Now, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Rob Wake continues, I can't put my finger on why Super Mario
8742520	8746160	Galaxy 2 is so much more fun when compared to Super Mario Galaxy.
8746160	8751220	I like both, but the star gathering in Super Mario Galaxy 2 does not feel like work.
8751220	8753920	Some of those SMG stars were hard work.
8753920	8757560	There doesn't seem to be as much pressure to replay levels for stars, either.
8757560	8761520	I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the game, especially after hearing the Super Mario 64
8761520	8763440	classic as the game of the week.
8763440	8767360	Tune into a future episode when one of us has actually played the damn game, but my
8767360	8768560	Wii's just not hooked up right now.
8768560	8771640	My Wii's semi-bricked from New Super Mario Brothers.
8771640	8774200	Blur and these other games that play it.
8774200	8775520	Really, your Wii got bricked?
8775520	8776520	Semi-bricked.
8776520	8777520	What's that mean?
8777520	8781640	Semi-bricked is when you play a game of a different region on your system, and what
8781640	8787760	happens is a second update gets put in there, and so now I can play games on it, but I can't
8787760	8792040	go into the system menu and change settings, so I have to fix it.
8792040	8796960	I've just been so lazy to fix it, I just, I really don't care, to be honest.
8796960	8802840	It's just, I've been too busy playing other games and to actually go and play, you know,
8802840	8808200	New Super Mario Brothers or Super Mario Galaxy 2, it's just, I just don't feel compelled
8808200	8812100	to do so, even if it's super awesome.
8812100	8815000	It's just, I don't know.
8815000	8816880	Although my trait other end looks pretty nice.
8816880	8821440	I watched a new video of that this weekend, it looks pretty cool.
8821440	8823920	It's just getting to be a busy time of year, especially with it's summer and all, it's
8823920	8824920	only going to get worse.
8824920	8825920	It is.
8825920	8826920	It's only going to get worse.
8826920	8831840	And like, you know, as far as games coming out, man, as far as what I'm planning on getting,
8831840	8834200	pretty much just cracked down to this summer and that's it.
8834200	8837160	I mean, there's going to be a few months where I'm not really playing anything new, which
8837160	8841220	is fine because I have tons of other stuff to play, but it's just, I don't really want
8841220	8844960	to get anything that I don't think I'm going to play.
8844960	8845960	Metroid Other M?
8845960	8850040	Uh, well I guess Metroid Other M, but I mean, that's like at the very end of the summer.
8850040	8853040	And actually, you know, I might not get it right away because, you know, Kid will be
8853040	8854040	born right then, so.
8854040	8855040	Oh yeah, that's true.
8855040	8856040	We'll have time.
8856040	8860120	Im2good in our chat room, I like that nickname by the way, Im2good says, Prince of Persia
8860120	8864400	is an average movie, but that means it's like the moon landing for video game movies.
8864400	8870400	One small step for man, one giant leap for video game movies to not be a turd of shit.
8870400	8874160	I like the turd is now a measurement of shit, as opposed to just being another name.
8874160	8875160	Alright.
8875160	8876760	I thought it was the Keurig.
8876760	8877760	Forget it.
8877760	8879960	Moving on.
8879960	8883400	Another email from Rob Babula that I want to bring up here, he's suggesting that we
8883400	8886200	should play the 3-6-9 music from Schoolhouse Rock for the show.
8886200	8888480	I'm sorry, I didn't have it queued up, my bad.
8888480	8890920	But I do want to address this other point in the email.
8890920	8896120	Also, two weeks ago, I saw my first Tron-a-rail in Disney World, that's just what we called
8896120	8899240	it, but it turned out to be the official name for the decorated trains.
8899240	8900920	Any sightings in Disneyland?
8900920	8905640	I don't believe they've redone the monorail as Tron, I don't think they're planning to
8905640	8909520	do that, but you never know, when it gets a little closer to the movie releases.
8909520	8913620	There was a rumor that the people mover with Tron was going to come back, but I'm not holding
8913620	8917200	my breath on that, I think if it does, it ain't happening this year.
8917200	8919040	But no, nothing in Disneyland yet.
8919040	8923040	So we're all waiting on pins and needles that hopefully the people mover will reopen.
8923040	8927160	And also of note, not to turn this into a Disney podcast, but in about what, one more
8927160	8928160	month?
8928160	8934760	Star Tours will close, and Star Tours is no longer going to be there in its current form.
8934760	8935760	They're redoing it for...
8935760	8938720	There's going to be a Star Wars 2.0 that comes out later.
8938720	8942640	And they're going to make it all stupid in the prequels, so whatever.
8942640	8946680	If it's the pod race, I'm okay with that, because the pod race, that's the rumor that
8946680	8950140	it's a pod race right now, and that might be kind of cool.
8950140	8953960	And hopefully you get to run over Jar Jar Binks, that would be amazing.
8953960	8956720	And if Greg Proops is still one of the commentators, that's also amazing.
8956720	8958720	That would be awesome.
8958720	8961640	Oh, that's right, yeah, he was a commentator.
8961640	8962640	He was one of the two heads.
8962640	8963640	I remember that.
8963640	8969600	No, it'd be funny though, like Robot Chicken and stuff, where they have all the Jar Jar
8969600	8975960	Binks stuff, they should just make it look like it's going to be some sort of pod race,
8975960	8980160	lock the doors, and then it's just all Jar Jar Binks talking to you for a good like five
8980160	8981160	minutes.
8981160	8984440	Oh god, children would cry and run screaming away.
8984440	8988040	I would complain that my day was not magical.
8988040	8989040	I was not magical.
8989040	8991840	I am not having a magical day now.
8991840	8994760	Alright, moving on.
8994760	8998520	This comes from Shook.
8998520	8999520	Big S, Big K.
8999520	9001160	Hi, OLR.
9001160	9002880	I'm here for a rant.
9002880	9005480	Lately in zombie discussions or something similar.
9005480	9008960	People act like they know everything about shotguns and.44s, etc.
9008960	9012460	When really they're from a big city and have been nowhere near a gun except maybe in their
9012460	9013460	little gang.
9013460	9017240	I'm not trying to sound like some country bumpkin, but it really pisses me off when
9017240	9018480	they act like know-it-alls.
9018480	9019480	What are your thoughts?
9019480	9020480	Well...
9020480	9023600	Don't make me bust out my Glock.
9023600	9027600	I don't think anyone like really wants to shoot somebody in the face.
9027600	9032720	Like in Red Dead Redemption, it's just like funny to see, does that make sense?
9032720	9037280	I am an adult, I understand what is fiction and what is real, I'm not gonna go shoot someone
9037280	9040000	in the face if it's gonna kill them.
9040000	9043600	And I will be the first to admit, I don't know the difference between all these different
9043600	9046680	types of guns because I don't like guns and I would never own a gun.
9046680	9047680	Wait, what guns?
9047680	9048680	What are we talking about guns?
9048680	9049680	Shotguns and.44s, etc.
9049680	9051880	They're just saying I know everything about these guns.
9051880	9053600	Not me specifically, but just people.
9053600	9054800	You know how I learned a lot about...
9054800	9057000	I can't wait until I own a gun.
9057000	9061040	You know how I learned a lot about guns from playing Airsoft.
9061040	9063800	Because a lot of the guns that they have out there are modeled in...
9063800	9069840	Now I can say, hey, that's an MP7, oh hey, that's a G36.
9069840	9071280	So it's kind of cool.
9071280	9076720	You know how I learned about guns very well?
9076720	9077720	Writing G.I.
9077720	9079640	Joe fan fiction about ten years ago.
9079640	9080720	I'm not joking.
9080720	9082120	This is a human.
9082120	9084080	Ten years ago, I was writing G.I.
9084080	9085960	Joe fan fiction.
9085960	9087420	And I did my research.
9087420	9094400	I have no interest in firing a gun that is not of the laser variety or the shooting range.
9094400	9096960	I do still want a Hello Kitty assault rifle.
9096960	9098440	We should go out to the shooting range.
9098440	9099440	I wanna go.
9099440	9101480	My friend used to go down there.
9101480	9103520	I was gonna go with him, but he moved too soon.
9103520	9105040	I'll have to take a picture of this.
9105040	9106040	Santa Cruz.
9106040	9108380	Dan got to shoot off a.50 caliber.
9108380	9112000	One more, you guys, from dragonboy69.
9112000	9115880	I was wondering if any of you might know why some games, specifically Vagrant Story and
9115880	9120600	Breath of Fire 3, show up on the Japan and European PSN store, but not on the North American
9120600	9121600	store.
9121600	9122600	Thanks for any help you can provide.
9122600	9123600	Keep up the great work.
9123600	9127760	Because Vagrant Story sucked?
9127760	9128760	But here's the thing.
9128760	9130120	Just sometimes it's a rights issue.
9130120	9132520	And Final Fantasy 9, I think, is another big one, right?
9132520	9136480	It's showing up in other stores, but not the current one.
9136480	9140240	It's rights issues and sometimes timing and other things.
9140240	9141920	It's sometimes kind of complicated.
9141920	9145460	I think it has to do with the fact that sometimes different companies publish different games
9145460	9148160	in different countries, and that sometimes complicates things.
9148160	9150320	But I think Wikipedia keeps a pretty good list of what's available.
9150320	9151320	Time localization, too.
9151320	9152320	Yeah, it's true, too.
9152320	9160000	I'm posting this picture up on the site of my Hello Kitty holding a.50 caliber shell.
9160000	9165720	And also, too, it's sometimes just the ability for that company to be able to distribute
9165720	9167480	the game in a timely manner.
9167480	9173880	For example, Morph-X, which was a game that came out in Europe just recently, is actually
9173880	9177920	region coded for both Europe and the North American regions.
9177920	9182280	So in theory, you could actually release the game here, and it would be just fine.
9182280	9186660	But for whatever reason, it may have not passed the ratings board yet.
9186660	9191280	Maybe they don't have enough manpower to actually duplicate the units that they need.
9191280	9199480	Because some of these companies, like Graffiti Entertainment or Zoo Games and stuff, their
9199480	9205280	titles go for sometimes years if delays before they're actually released.
9205280	9206280	It's ridiculous.
9206280	9207280	Graffiti Entertainment.
9207280	9210200	That's going to do it for our mailbag.

9216160	9220560	After the mailbag is usually the section of the show where we get a little irritated,
9220560	9224160	and we do a little segment on the show called the FUs of the Week.
9224160	9225160	Why?
9225160	9226160	Because we can.
9226160	9245840	And if you need a little inspiration, we have an inspiration for your FU story tonight.
9245840	9250440	It's about a Virginia man named Bruce Jamar Walston.
9250440	9255200	Apparently authorities were called to his apartment by the girlfriend, because apparently
9255200	9260800	a couple nights ago, the woman called 911.
9260800	9262280	You're not going to like this, folks.
9262280	9264640	You're really not going to like this, okay?
9264640	9268520	And this really doesn't have anything to do with video games, but it does, because it's
9268520	9270480	making the rounds on video game blogs.
9270480	9273320	But you're not going to like it.
9273320	9276400	You're really not going to like this, okay?
9276400	9282720	Apparently the guy here that was arrested, Bruce Walston, was angered that the video
9282720	9288440	game he was playing was disconnected by his girlfriend's new kitten.
9288440	9290960	So he picked up the animal.
9290960	9296400	I'm not going to say what happened, but the animal died.
9296400	9304600	And this all occurred, wait for it, wait for it, in front of the woman's children.
9304600	9308780	He's being held without bond at the Middle River Regional Jarrell in Verona, in case
9308780	9311400	you want to send him your cards and letters.
9311400	9314640	For killing a kitten for unplugging the video game console.
9314640	9318360	Not only did he kill the cat, he did it in front of the children.
9318360	9319360	Way to go!
9319360	9320360	Psychopath.
9320360	9321360	You ass!
9321360	9322360	God.
9322360	9325160	That's mental problems.
9325160	9326160	You know what, though?
9326160	9327480	Can I side rant?
9327480	9331600	I realize, you know, I'm out of order here, but can I just side rant here?
9331600	9335680	I really hate it when video game blogs kind of run with these stories, and maybe I hate
9335680	9340440	myself for bringing this up, or bringing it up in this context of this guy is an asshole.
9340440	9344800	But like, this really has nothing to do with video games, and it just gives video gamers
9344800	9346220	a bad name.
9346220	9350960	This guy is a parasite of society, end of story.
9350960	9355460	He needs to be shot out of a cannon into a land far, far away, where we will never see
9355460	9357480	or hear from him again.
9357480	9358480	That's really it.
9358480	9363520	I mean, why would you throw a kitten against the, I almost said what happened there, and
9363520	9367680	I said I would not, because it would happen to the cat, but why would you kill a cat in
9367680	9369360	front of the children?
9369360	9371480	That is just effed up beyond belief.
9371480	9373640	Oh my god, this guy's picture?
9373640	9378560	I know, he just looks like a winner, doesn't he?
9378560	9379560	I know.
9379560	9380560	I know.
9380560	9382120	What a piece of shit.
9382120	9384680	Alright, so anyway.
9384680	9385680	Who would like to start?
9385680	9386680	Good without Bond.
9386680	9388200	Would you like to start off with the FUs of the week, Darcy?
9388200	9389800	Do you have some inspiration now?
9389800	9390800	I'm disgusted.
9390800	9394280	I know, it's disgusting, I thought you wouldn't like it.
9394280	9396280	My turn up.
9396280	9397280	What?
9397280	9403680	Dan said it's better he didn't kill the kid, it's better than him.
9403680	9406840	Dan is yelling from the living room, Jamie would be less mad if the guy had killed the
9406840	9407840	kid.
9407840	9408840	Whatever.
9408840	9412760	It's still messed up, no matter what, it's messed up.
9412760	9413760	Alright.
9413760	9414760	I'm gonna make mine quick.
9414760	9415760	Yes.
9415760	9420640	My first FU goes towards losing my voice and a little bit of cough I have left.
9420640	9431160	My next one is a humongous FU to Helen Thomas, who is one of the senior White House press
9431160	9439040	corps members who basically went on record saying that Jews should get out of Palestine
9439040	9441360	and go back to Germany or Poland.
9441360	9442360	Yeah.
9442360	9448000	She didn't say go back to Jew land.
9448000	9455360	Well, it's, first of all, telling people to go back to places that, you know, they basically
9455360	9463120	left due to, how about being murdered, you know, to go back to their homeland is just
9463120	9464120	really insensitive.
9464120	9467960	Maybe Helen Thomas should go back to her homeland, because I don't think she's Native American,
9467960	9472640	so um, boat's coming, get on it, bye.
9472640	9478440	It's just really, really, and you know, the only reason, she did apologize for it, but
9478440	9483200	the only reason I think she apologized for it is because they called her on it, and now
9483200	9489080	they're calling for her resignation, or her to get sacked, and honestly, I agree.
9489080	9495840	Now if she had her own personal private blog and said this as herself with a these views
9495840	9502640	do not reflect White House blah, blah, blah, fine, insensitive, shitty as hell, you're
9502640	9507640	still a bitch, but, but this is America.
9507640	9508640	We do.
9508640	9511020	She has the right to be a bitch and we have the right to call her a bitch.
9511020	9516960	That's a free speech is all about to say it in her capacity in a public forum as a representative
9516960	9520240	of the White House press corps as a senior representative.
9520240	9525200	Now tell me that's just not highly irresponsible and incredibly insensitive.
9525200	9530560	I think she should get sacked and drawn behind a cart by her toes.
9530560	9533760	I want to see Obama just punch her on the White House lawn, that'd be amazing.
9533760	9541480	She's a good bitch, but yeah, and that's not that I'm advocating violence, but in special
9541480	9542480	circumstances it's okay.
9542480	9548320	And you know what, it's funny because her apology is not even, she's saying that she
9548320	9552960	deeply regretted the comments I made last week regarding Israelis and Palestinians.
9552960	9557280	They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when
9557280	9561760	all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance, may that day come soon.
9561760	9564760	She didn't really address what she said.
9564760	9565800	Not at all.
9565800	9570120	She just let out a blanket statement to appease everybody that doesn't really address the
9570120	9571120	problem.
9571120	9574900	She, if she was going to have any sincerity of it, she needs to say, you know what?
9574900	9580360	I was wrong, sorry.
9580360	9581360	Nasty woman.
9581360	9582560	She looks nasty.
9582560	9586080	I'm seriously, she looks like, like the picture of a hag.
9586080	9588440	Alright, let's move on.
9588440	9589440	Loki!
9589440	9596480	Uh, F you to myself for having the obsessive compulsion to spend money on stupid things
9596480	9602560	that I really don't need to spend money on, like Project Under $100, for example.
9602560	9608400	Not that that's going to stop me from doing it, and also F you to the fact that I don't
9608400	9612960	have any airsoft guns, because, or, and I'm also not in the airsoft gun really right now
9612960	9617520	because I don't have any airsoft guns, because I really want the Magpulpty SFPG.
9617520	9622800	The folding pocket gun looks so awesome, and it's a gun that folds out of a briefcase shape
9622800	9627680	into a, like a little personal assault rifle, and that's awesome, good times, but it's also
9627680	9631320	really expensive and I don't need it, at least I'm not buying that.
9631320	9636720	Um, my F you of the week goes to, um, the returning side panes that I've been having,
9636720	9640040	because, uh, yeah, that's why I went to the hospital a couple years ago and I really don't
9640040	9641040	want to go back.
9641040	9644240	Um, maybe it's Mother Nature trying to tell me I need to go on a diet again.
9644240	9647120	I don't know, but I don't like being freaked out like that.
9647120	9648120	It sucks.
9648120	9650280	I F you to my body.
9650280	9651280	Wah.
9651280	9655680	Alright, uh, let's move on with, uh, just a couple more news stories for you guys, then
9655680	9657320	the Skype line.
9657320	9658600	We'll get to the Skype line here.
9658600	9661840	Uh, admittedly it's going to be a little bit shorter Skype line tonight, because, uh, we
9661840	9665640	had a really long show, and we still have an afterbirth yet too before it gets too late,
9665640	9668240	but, uh, we will at least take some calls here in just a little bit.
9668240	9670800	In the meantime, Loki, what you got for us?
9670800	9677560	Games Convention Online in Leipzig is actually going to be going, um, industry only this
9677560	9678560	year.
9678560	9687320	Apparently, um, I guess they had 43,000 attendees in 2009, and, um, you know, now they're just
9687320	9694740	saying the number of registered public exhibitors was insufficient, and that the satisfied interest
9694740	9700440	of the visitors, whose past experiences bring them with high expectations to Leipzig, um,
9700440	9706680	it doesn't make sense why they're going to cut it, but they're planning on, um, I guess,
9706680	9712640	um, having 30 companies attending this year, which is already bigger than last year, but,
9712640	9715440	um, it will not be open to the public.
9715440	9720600	So it's basically, this show's got too many common folk at it, so, uh, in order for our
9720600	9721600	show to get bigger-
9721600	9722600	For business to happen.
9722600	9723920	It's basically what E3 did.
9723920	9724920	Yeah.
9724920	9730560	But, I mean, this is a good, maybe a good example of why we don't have E3 open to the
9730560	9734520	public, because it would be a nut house.
9734520	9737120	Alright.
9737120	9741120	Let's move on with one more story here, and this is more of a wrap-up here.
9741120	9745400	There's, um, actually some things going around out there that show what some of the confirmed
9745400	9747640	games that are going to be shown at E3 are.
9747640	9750280	Let me run down some of the, uh, companies here and some of the games that they're going
9750280	9751280	to be showing.
9751280	9754160	2K Games is going to be showing Mafia 2.
9754160	9759360	And keep in mind, this is only announced stuff, because there's always surprises, always,
9759360	9760960	always, always surprises at E3.
9760960	9765200	So don't take this as, like, the definitive list of the only things being shown at E3.
9765200	9767600	This is just what is confirmed thus far.
9767600	9774000	2K Games is showing Mafia 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V, Spec Ops The Line, and XCOM.
9774000	9776440	I didn't even know they were remaking XCOM, right?
9776440	9781060	Yeah, it's supposed to be not so much like, it's more like a first-person shooter now.
9781060	9784640	I might remember hearing it on a previous show or something, but this is the first time
9784640	9787880	I remember hearing it, um, right now, so.
9787880	9793440	Uh, let's see, Activision has Call of Duty Black Ops and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock,
9793440	9796560	and supposedly that's it, I somehow doubt that.
9796560	9802680	Bethesda's bringing Brink, Fallout New Vegas, Hunted the Demons Forge, and Rage.
9802680	9808120	Capcom 2 has Dead Rising 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and an untitled sequel.
9808120	9812400	Uh, let's see, and that's, I'm ignoring the mobile stuff.
9812400	9817640	Disney Interactive Studios has Epic Mickey, Guilty Party, Pirates, are they really gonna
9817640	9818960	call that game Epic Mickey?
9818960	9820600	I think that's a stupid title.
9820600	9822400	Maybe it's just the working title right now.
9822400	9826640	God, I hope it is, cause that's a, let me go on record saying that is a stupid name
9826640	9828280	for a video game.
9828280	9833760	Pirates of the Caribbean Armada of the Damned, Toy Story 3, Tron Evolution, and Tron Legacy.
9833760	9835640	Hey, I'm all about checking out the Tron.
9835640	9836640	Those are supposed to be cool.
9836640	9839280	I wanna see what that looks like, that's gonna be awesome.
9839280	9846320	Uh, EA is showing APB, Bulletstorm, Crysis 2, Dead Space 2, EA Sports Active 2.0, FIFA
9846320	9853000	Soccer 11, Madden NFL 11, Medal of Honor, NBA Jam, NCAA Football 11, NHL 11, Tiger Woods
9853000	9856320	PGA Tour 11, lots and lots of sporty games.
9856320	9863080	Hudson Soft, Beyblade, Metal Fusion, Bomberman Live, Battlefest, Bonk, Brink of Extinction,
9863080	9868920	Deca Sports 3, Lost in Shadow, and Oops! Prank Party on the Wii.
9868920	9873280	Oops, I crapped my pants party.
9873280	9875880	Oh my god, Oops! Prank Party.
9875880	9881840	Konami has Castlevania Puzzle, Angkor of the Night, Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Def Jam
9881840	9889880	Rap Star, Lucha Libre AAA, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, N399 Nights 2, Pro Evo Soccer
9889880	9897720	2010, Rocket Knight, Russian Attack Ex-Patriot Saw 2, and the Cages Pro Style Batting Practice.
9897720	9901640	As I said earlier in the show, notice no DDR in that list.
9901640	9903000	Could DDR be dead?
9903000	9906200	Nope, I will tell you what they're probably gonna do.
9906200	9907200	Surprise announcement?
9907200	9911160	They're gonna make an announcement that's gonna support N-Tall.
9911160	9912160	You think?
9912160	9913720	Yeah, I have a feeling.
9913720	9915000	Alright, we'll see what happens.
9915000	9918400	Because you know, Konami, they like doing gimmicky shit that doesn't make any sense
9918400	9920120	for the franchise whatsoever.
9920120	9925280	For example, what they were showing off at last E3 with Dance Dance Revolution, playing
9925280	9929880	Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii Fit balance board using your ass.
9929880	9931800	That made no fucking sense.
9931800	9937320	Do you guys want some video at E3 of me playing Def Jam Rap Star?
9937320	9939960	You know who I want to see video playing that?
9939960	9940960	What?
9940960	9941960	Irene.
9941960	9945120	Ah, I wish she could go to E3 this year.
9945120	9946120	Good times.
9946120	9947960	My heart, Irene.
9947960	9952600	LucasArts is bringing Lego Star Wars 3, Monkey Island 2 Special Edition, The Force Unleashed

9961680	9962680	Microsoft.

9964800	9965800	Apparently not.
9965800	9966800	Disappointment.
9966800	9972040	Uh, let's see, Microsoft is bringing Fable 3, Gears of War 3, Halo Reach, and Project

9973680	9979640	MTV Games is bringing Rock Band 3, Namco Bandai is bringing Ace Combat, Clash of the Titans,

9987840	9994000	Natsume is bringing Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar, and Lufia, Curse of the Sinistrals.
9994000	9995000	Yes?
9995000	9996280	Dude, I remember Lufia.
9996280	9997760	It's coming back.
9997760	9999480	It's I think a remake of the old games.
9999480	10000660	I think I have Lufia.
10000660	10003280	It's coming back.
10003280	10008520	Tokyo's bringing Metroid Other M, The Legend of Zelda Wii, Wii Vitality Sensor Games, and
10008520	10010080	all their 3DS games.
10010080	10012640	No mention of Pokemon Black and White yet, which is interesting.
10012640	10015480	I would thought that that would be out on the floor, but maybe they're just not ready.
10015480	10019440	Maybe that'll be a Tokyo game show, I don't know.
10019440	10021360	Sega's got Conduit 2.
10021360	10023200	I didn't know they were making a Conduit 2.
10023200	10024200	Yeah.
10024200	10025200	Nice.
10025200	10030520	Phantasy Star Portable 2, Tournament of Legends Wii, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1, Sonic

10055560	10056880	Ooh, The Last Guardian.
10056880	10058880	That was that epic trailer last year, huh?
10058880	10059880	Yeah, it was.
10059880	10060880	I remember.
10060880	10061880	I want to see that.
10061880	10064560	Sounds awesome.
10064560	10065560	Let's see what else we got.
10065560	10071480	Squeenix, Deus Ex, Human Revolution, Final Fantasy XIV, Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep,

10075080	10078680	I know that sounds kind of weird that that's at the Squeenix booth, but there's that whole
10078680	10079960	merger now.
10079960	10082280	That's how it works.
10082280	10083560	We got a few more for you guys.

10140160	10142000	There it is, a list of what is being shown at E3.
10142000	10145680	Sounds like it's going to be a fun year, isn't it?
10145680	10150320	I'm excited, I'm sorry, that's what I meant, adjectives, not verbs, don't you have all
10150320	10151880	of it though it seems like?
10151880	10152880	No.
10152880	10155880	It'd be hard to spawn a verb.
10155880	10157880	Spawn run.
10157880	10164760	Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we're going to get to some last minute
10164760	10168640	stories because, well actually I take that back, we already have calls coming in, let's
10168640	10174120	go to the Skype line, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,
10174120	10176880	we're going to go to the Skype line right now, we've already got calls coming in, hi,
10176880	10179880	you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10179880	10180880	It's Ray Iyanami.
10180880	10184520	Hey, Ray Iyanami, what's on your mind, buddy?
10184520	10187400	I've been bad from Fanime for about a week now.
10187400	10192500	Fanime was over Memorial Day weekend, sadly I was not there, I was in Portland, but how
10192500	10195840	was Fanime this year?
10195840	10202800	Pretty fun, it seems to get better every year, and there's a few crappy parts, but it doesn't
10202800	10206200	detract from the experience as a whole usually.
10206200	10210080	Well first things first, I've got to ask, since it is a video game show, how is the
10210080	10211720	game room at Fanime?
10211720	10217960	Okay, I can't take it back, so, gaming room for arcades, they had, like the usual stuff
10217960	10223840	from last year, but this time they have a few new things like Mushihime-sama and Digimax-Technica,
10223840	10228760	I was the special side to see Technica, even if they have the Platinum Crew servers, but
10228760	10231600	I expected it not to be there anyway.
10231600	10235320	Did they wheel that all over from SVGL or something?
10235320	10240320	Actually no, from what I've heard, like some years ago, there was some fallout between
10240320	10247720	Fanime and Golf Land, so now Fanime gets their machines from University arcades, like, someone
10247720	10249640	from San Jose State and UCLA.
10249640	10250640	Oh, okay.
10250640	10251640	Gotcha.
10251640	10255120	So we ended up getting UCLA's machine.
10255120	10257360	Hmm, interesting.
10257360	10260520	Well that's cool, it sounds like game room was fun.
10260520	10263680	Most of the game room was a bit of a letdown this year, mainly because there weren't as
10263680	10269600	many TVs, like, the concentration of people playing fighting games and people playing
10269600	10274520	other games like Class D, Jameson's Smokes and such was really high this year, like,
10274520	10282160	like you pick a random TV, like 4-5 times, it's probably going to be Brawl or something
10282160	10288080	else like, or Rock Band or something, or like something I say pretty much every damn con
10288080	10291220	gaming room.
10291220	10292220	What about some cosplay?
10292220	10293840	Was there any good gaming cosplay?
10293840	10297280	I know DarkSakuro showed me a picture earlier, I don't think it was from Fanime, but some
10297280	10298680	Metal Gear cosplay.
10298680	10301520	Was there any good gaming cosplay you saw?
10301520	10303680	Umm, yeah.
10303680	10306480	Well, like what?
10306480	10310680	I saw a picture of a Vanille from Final Fantasy XIII that looked really cute, I thought she
10310680	10311680	did a good job.
10311680	10312680	What'd you see?
10312680	10316360	I saw a lot of Touhou cosplay, though that's mainly because I went to the Touhou Gathering
10316360	10322440	and the explosion of, like, Touhou related events on Sunday, I was sad to not see any
10322440	10324560	Bimani cosplay like usual.
10324560	10328360	Well, I hate to tell you, but Bimani's kind of fading out.
10328360	10329360	Yeah, I know.
10329360	10334960	It's just like, I saw a few 2DX cosplayers at SoccerCon, which I didn't get pictures
10334960	10339200	of much from my Chagrin, or Chagrin, however I'll pronounce that.
10339200	10342240	I'm looking at some of your pictures, it looks like there was a Pac-Man there I'm looking
10342240	10347700	at and I'm looking at a Black Mage and a Sackboy, Loki's Sackboy costume is better though.
10347700	10350680	I saw some BlazBlue cosplay like Hazama and Lychee.
10350680	10352320	Oh, that's cool.
10352320	10356760	I saw a couple Captain Falcons, which is one of the alternate palettes from Super Smash
10356760	10357760	Brothers, interestingly.
10357760	10365820	There's also the guy that does British cosplay every year, so glad to see him every year.
10365820	10368800	Now what's this about, there were some protesters?
10368800	10370600	Were people protesting Faname?
10370600	10371600	What's up with this?
10371600	10377320	Uh, they weren't protesting Faname per se, it's basically, you know about those fire
10377320	10383120	and brimstone preachers that go turn or burn and such like that?
10383120	10387160	Oh yeah, yeah, you always see them out, like even when I was in Portland there was one
10387160	10392780	out at the fair, they do like a cute little fair downtown where a lot of local vendors
10392780	10396820	come out and sell their local goods and there was some guy standing there on the street
10396820	10402160	corner spouting their whole thing about, you know, everybody's going to hell, and that
10402160	10403160	whole thing.
10403160	10404960	So Faname got a little bit of that?
10404960	10405960	Yeah.
10405960	10407960	Good times.
10407960	10418200	Oh, I came across a Guitar Freaks V4 machine with EMU slots, but it's not connected to
10418200	10419200	EMUs.
10419200	10420200	Interesting.
10420200	10423840	Did you actually play some of the Guitar Freaks?
10423840	10427680	No, I don't really play Guitar Freaks or Drummania.
10427680	10430920	I'm more of a 2DX person and a DJ Maxx person.
10430920	10432920	Did they have 2DX?
10432920	10438400	Um, yeah they did, but interestingly it was a hacked version of 2DX Empress with DJ Maxx
10438400	10440560	crossovers and other things on it.
10440560	10441560	Huh.
10441560	10445160	I didn't play it because the screen was laggy and laggy screens make me rage quit.
10445160	10451360	Wait, wait, wait, there was, there was Technica, I'm sorry, DJ Maxx crossovers in this game?
10451360	10452360	How was that?
10452360	10453360	Is it a hack?
10453360	10459320	Yeah, someone has some DJ Maxx songs into 2DX, which is very interesting.
10459320	10462800	I've seen a video of it on YouTube before.
10462800	10466240	Hmm, interesting.
10466240	10470240	Well I didn't even know something like that existed, but that's cool.
10470240	10476160	Well any other thoughts on Faname you want to tell us before we let you go?
10476160	10480160	I think what Faname could do next year for the console gaming is maybe have one section
10480160	10486080	where it's like no fighting games or anything like that, like classic games and shooters
10486080	10491720	and other things that don't require you to kick ass and have fun.
10491720	10494680	I'm all about a classic game room like they have at PAX.
10494680	10495680	Good stuff.
10495680	10499960	Yeah, they had one at SoccerCon, they had a retro gaming room where it was mostly like
10499960	10506320	stuff, like N64 era stuff and earlier.
10506320	10507320	Very cool.
10507320	10508920	Well hopefully we'll be able to make it out next year.
10508920	10511680	I know we skipped this year, but maybe we'll be back.
10511680	10515880	I haven't seen you guys since 2007, so I'm getting worried if I'll ever see you at Faname
10515880	10516880	again.
10516880	10517880	Well, we'll try to make it work.
10517880	10518880	When's California Xtreme?
10518880	10519880	I saw you asking about that.
10519880	10520880	That already happened.
10520880	10521880	I'll go to Faname next year.
10521880	10522880	When's California Xtreme?
10522880	10527920	I think it's in July, aka next month.
10527920	10531160	Maybe we'll go to that, because I've never been to California Xtreme and I'd really like
10531160	10532160	to go.
10532160	10533160	What do you think there, Sakura?
10533160	10534160	Do it.
10534160	10535160	Think we'll make that happen in July?
10535160	10536160	We'll see what we can do.
10536160	10539640	I'm not going to make any promises yet, but July would be a lot better than June.
10539640	10540640	So maybe.
10540640	10545160	Alright, well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank
10545160	10547160	you so much for your call and have fun.
10547160	10549160	Alright, see ya.
10549160	10550160	Later.
10550160	10554000	1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRady if you want to give us a
10554000	10555000	call.
10555000	10556480	Loki, do you have any other last minute stories for us real quick?
10556480	10558960	Yeah, I got some interesting things.
10558960	10565840	There's a rumor that they're going to be doing a Street Fighter versus Tekken game.
10565840	10566840	That's kind of interesting.
10566840	10567840	Interesting.
10567840	10568840	Sounds like fun.
10568840	10569840	Yes.
10569840	10576840	So maybe that's going to be kind of the title they're going to announce at E3, I don't know.
10576840	10579520	July 17th through 18th for California Xtreme.
10579520	10580520	Let's go to the phones.
10580520	10581840	Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.
10581840	10582840	Who's this?
10582840	10584840	Hi, this is Spazinator.
10584840	10588600	Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?
10588600	10596440	I had one question that kind of ties in very loosely to the last call that you had.
10596440	10597440	Alright, but just one.
10597440	10598440	No, I'm just kidding.
10598440	10599440	What's up?
10599440	10605920	I was kind of wondering, is there any like retro games that you would love to see either
10605920	10613600	in Microsoft's game room or on PSN that's not already there or hasn't been announced?
10613600	10615120	Ooh, good question.
10615120	10619440	I would definitely like to see PS2 somehow able to get some of my old PS, because believe
10619440	10622440	it or not, PS2 is getting to be, you know, when did the PS2 come out?
10622440	10623440	About 10 years ago.
10623440	10625360	So it's going to be a little bit retro.
10625360	10629040	As far otherwise, I would say I would like to see a little bit more of the Commodore
10629040	10630240	64 love.
10630240	10634220	There's a little bit of that on the Wii, but we don't have enough of it, especially here
10634220	10635220	stateside.
10635220	10638660	I realize Commodore 64 was a bigger deal over in Europe, but like I would love to see stuff
10638660	10641600	like Impossible Mission and so forth released over here.
10641600	10646400	And I hope that my earlier inkling, that if Game Room is going to reach thousands of games,
10646400	10651840	then they're going to dip into the old like Apple IIe library and the Commodore 64 library
10651840	10652840	and some of that.
10652840	10655880	I hope my inkling there is correct, because there's lots of Commodore 64 games I would
10655880	10657080	love to see get the treatment.
10657080	10661080	I mean, you guys should see some of the EA games back when they were ECA.
10661080	10662800	They made some pretty epic games.
10662800	10666200	Mule, M-U-L-E, was a great game on the 64.
10666200	10667680	I'd love to see make a comeback.
10667680	10672960	You know, there's a lot of those like classic computer games of yesteryear I would love
10672960	10673960	to see.
10673960	10676200	And if that happens on PSN, that would be great too.
10676200	10681040	Although I sort of see the classic stuff on PSN as being more of a like Sony-based thing
10681040	10682040	usually.
10682040	10683560	I don't usually see a lot of old stuff.
10683560	10684560	But you know what's interesting?
10684560	10686120	There has been some obscure stuff.
10686120	10687840	Let me give you one retro title.
10687840	10692720	Digger HD is out on PlayStation Network, and it's kind of an overlooked title, but it's
10692720	10695120	a remake of an old, old PC game.
10695120	10700000	And what's really cool, the old PC game is in there and playable.
10700000	10705200	It's not one of my favorite classic games and not one that necessarily necessitated
10705200	10711360	the treatment it got, but I think it's an example of a retro remake done really well.
10711360	10714100	And that is on PlayStation Network and not on 360.
10714100	10716040	It's only on PSN, Digger HD.
10716040	10717040	It's worth a look.
10717040	10718040	Oh, yeah.
10718040	10720040	Yeah, I got that one too.
10720040	10724640	In fact, I got that two I want to see roughly about a month and a half ago.
10724640	10725640	That's pretty good.
10725640	10726640	Yeah.
10726640	10728640	I mean, it's cute for a retro game.
10728640	10729640	Yeah.
10729640	10730640	Yeah.
10730640	10739560	At least in terms of game room, what I would love to see is like virtually any old classic
10739560	10741560	Capcom game.
10741560	10747440	I mean, Capcom, before they really started going gung ho on home consoles, they've been
10747440	10755320	known for their arcade titles, whether it be the 1940 series, the Street Fighter series
10755320	10761360	that's pretty much a given, Ghosts and Goblins, and so on and so forth.
10761360	10767600	Game room badly needs other publishers on board because right now the only game room
10767600	10774040	games that are coming out are Atari, Activision, Intellivision, and Konami.
10774040	10775040	That's it.
10775040	10778040	I have not seen games from, at least I can think of, off the top of my head.
10778040	10782040	I don't believe there are any other publisher's games showing up in game room, which is odd
10782040	10785920	because they promised this thousand games thing earlier.
10785920	10791060	And what's also strange to me, this week in game room, let me take a step back.
10791060	10797680	Game packs like three and four in the other expansions we got were packs of 14 games split
10797680	10799480	into two weeks worth of releases.
10799480	10801440	In other words, they were timed release.
10801440	10806040	It's like when you downloaded pack three, you got seven games one week and then seven
10806040	10807040	games the next.
10807040	10811680	Well, game pack five just came out and we got five games this week, which makes me think
10811680	10813960	it's going to be three weeks worth now.
10813960	10818920	They're stretching these game packs out longer and longer, like they are going to run out
10818920	10821200	of games.
10821200	10825320	My hope is that they are going to make some big announcements at E3 and that's kind of
10825320	10829940	why we're waiting because right now, okay, well the three weeks for game pack five would
10829940	10832440	take us right through the end of E3.
10832440	10834860	There was also a delay this week.
10834860	10838920	Game pack five was held up by a day and I don't know if maybe this all plays into it,
10838920	10843560	but I really hope that they are coming out at E3 and saying, hey, we have these other
10843560	10846000	publishers on board for game room.
10846000	10852040	If they don't do that, game room is doomed and it's really a bummer because there's so
10852040	10853840	much potential with game room.
10853840	10857960	Although I fired up video pinball this week, which was one of the releases.
10857960	10860960	Yeah, not what I remember when I was six.
10860960	10863520	I was kind of disappointed.
10863520	10875200	Yeah, in fact, I had just recently bought Super Breakouts and as Bobby Blackbroker,
10875200	10881800	he had pointed out on his show, Without the Pail is kind of a pain in the arse to play
10881800	10888200	that game, but still, even with that being said, you know, there's the whole nostalgia
10888200	10895560	factor considering that there was, I think the first game I ever played at Syphon Blackjack
10895560	10902160	on the 2600, so there's something behind that.
10902160	10907020	I think a lot of people also, when they think about the old Breakout games, they're really
10907020	10909520	thinking about Arkanoid.
10909520	10913120	You might know the difference between the games, and I'm sure someone like Bobby certainly
10913120	10917080	knows his video games and all that, but I think when a lot of us think about Breakout
10917080	10921960	and the retro goodness of that game, you're really remembering Arkanoid and some of the
10921960	10927640	better Breakout games that came out later on, and Tidal would be a good publisher to
10927640	10928640	buddy up with too.
10928640	10932280	You could get Arkanoid, Bubble Bobble, lots of good stuff.
10932280	10938480	The next few weeks are really crucial for game room, and I've gone on this tangent in
10938480	10940920	previous shows.
10940920	10944600	I'm really worried the game room is going to be a giant disappointment, and it's almost
10944600	10949000	more disappointing because if it doesn't work, you're not going to see anyone else want to
10949000	10954640	try it, and there was such good ideas here, but I really think those chrome layoffs affected
10954640	10958920	things harder than they claimed it was going to, but I hope they're at E3, because I'm
10958920	10959920	going to ask some questions.
10959920	10960920	I can't wait.
10960920	10961920	Oh yeah.
10961920	10962920	Can't wait.
10962920	10970440	Yeah, I really hope that despite the layoffs, they do manage to really turn out the games
10970440	10977480	for you, and they get all the support from the gaming community that they deserve, because
10977480	10984360	I just hate to have to wait another generation or two for something similar to game room.
10984360	10985360	Let's hope.
10985360	10986360	Let's hope.
10986360	10988760	Spaznator, I got to let you go, because we're going to go and wrap up the show, but thanks
10988760	10990760	so much as always for your call, okay?
10990760	10991760	Sure.
10991760	10992880	Have a good one.
10992880	10993880	You too, buddy.
10993880	10994880	All right.
10994880	10996680	That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.
10996680	11001600	I'm sorry to close the phones, but we're kind of running long tonight because part A was
11001600	11003000	really, really long tonight.
11003000	11006320	It was almost two hours long, so unfortunately I am going to close up the Skypline so we
11006320	11008880	can kind of wrap up the show, because we still have an afterword to get to and all that fun
11008880	11010720	stuff, and last minute stories.
11010720	11014800	We haven't let Loki finish last minute stories, but I did want to invite callers, please email
11014800	11015800	us right now.
11015800	11017360	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.
11017360	11019600	Get your thoughts out so we can read them on next week's show.
11019600	11020600	Loki.
11020600	11021600	Yes.
11021600	11022600	Other things.
11022600	11026160	There was a game that I think we talked about a long time ago.
11026160	11030740	It was a Grand Theft Auto kind of demake, I guess.
11030740	11035040	They were doing like an 8-bit version of it.
11035040	11039340	There's a guy working on like a ROM hack, or actually just kind of a custom game that
11039340	11044240	was going to be based on, I guess, Grand Theft Auto.
11044240	11050840	Well, now this game is being retitled and losing all of its Grand Theft Auto ties, but
11050840	11057560	it's going to be coming out on WiiWare as Retro City Rampage, and it looks pretty awesome.
11057560	11063200	They're going to have a bunch of different parodies on different things like Metal Gear,
11063200	11067600	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and whatnot, Sonic, and the game itself is pretty much
11067600	11073380	an open world action game, just like the old school top down Grand Theft Autos.
11073380	11075360	So that's pretty sweet.
11075360	11076360	Interesting.
11076360	11077360	Yeah.
11077360	11087840	Apparently, some of the Nintendo portables, the DSi XL, they are getting some new colors
11087840	11089680	of the DSi XL.
11089680	11096440	There's going to be yellow, blue, and green coming out in Japan, and also in time for
11096440	11099740	all that stuff, they're going to be dropping the price as well.
11099740	11107040	So cutting it down from 20,000 yen to 18,000 yen, and the DSi will also drop down from
11107040	11114480	18,900 yen to about 15,000 yen.
11114480	11119680	So that's kind of interesting, I guess getting ready for the 3DS.
11119680	11121800	That blue one is kind of pretty though, so is the green one.
11121800	11124320	Yellow one I could do without.
11124320	11129600	Then also in the UK, the DSi is getting the price drop as well.
11129600	11131880	Could they be announcing one on stage next week?
11131880	11132880	Yeah, that would be my guess.
11132880	11134880	Could that possibly be happening?
11134880	11141120	Yeah, and the funny thing is, these are all starting on June 18th.
11141120	11142120	June 18th.
11142120	11148560	Yeah, that doesn't coincide with something, I'm sure, if I put my mind to it.
11148560	11155520	And yeah, they will be dropping the price as well from 150 euros to, looks like 120
11155520	11164560	to 130 euros around there, so interesting.
11164560	11168640	There's a rumor that Kim Kardashian is going to be the next Lara Croft.
11168640	11169640	Whatever.
11169640	11174080	Well, she's got the assets to be Lara Croft, but that's about it.
11174080	11179080	She can't act way out of a box, so I don't really care.
11179080	11185920	MotorStorm 3 apparently is going post-apocalyptic, and this is coming from some screens leaked
11185920	11190040	on the French website PS3 Gen.
11190040	11196720	They have what they claim to be some stolen images of MotorStorm 3 showing kind of a,
11196720	11202840	I guess, San Francisco map that has buildings crumbling and whatnot.
11202840	11209440	To me, if this is actually real, this is kind of what fuel should have been, but I kind
11209440	11210440	of like that.
11210440	11211440	I think that'd be kind of cool.
11211440	11214880	I didn't really get into the last MotorStorm game, but the first one was pretty good.
11214880	11216240	Could be interesting.
11216240	11218160	I'm interested.
11218160	11223800	And then finally, Def Jam Rapstar is going to be coming out, I guess, this year.
11223800	11228200	Europe October 5th and North American November 6th.
11228200	11234560	The game will retail for $69.99 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and $59.99 on the Wii.
11234560	11237800	I'm assuming it comes with one microphone.
11237800	11244560	And some of the songs that have been announced for it, they've got Biz Marquee's Just a Friend,
11244560	11251960	Drake's Best I Ever Had, Ice Cube's with It Was a Good Day, Outkast's So Fresh, So Clean
11251960	11260960	by Pete Rock, and CL Smooth's The Reminisce is Over You, Troy.
11260960	11267840	And also Redman's and Method Man's Da Rock Wilder and Salt Peppers.
11267840	11268840	Push it.
11268840	11269840	Biz Marquee.
11269840	11272480	Push it real good.
11272480	11279480	They're going to have a freestyle mode as well as a couple of original instrumental
11279480	11282920	tracks, which I guess will tie in with the freestyle mode.
11282920	11285960	So, interesting.
11285960	11286960	Comments from our chat room.
11286960	11287960	Chat.org.com.
11287960	11292320	Salacious Pop commenting on the Kim Kardashian role.
11292320	11295800	You can't do backflips with an Ask That Fat.
11295800	11299080	I'm Too Good says if the second Lara Croft movie was the first one, it wouldn't have
11299080	11300080	bombed.
11300080	11303480	It wouldn't have been the first.
11303480	11304960	So I never saw either one.
11304960	11305960	I got to admit.
11305960	11307280	I don't watch a lot of video game movies.
11307280	11308460	I did see like Resident Evil.
11308460	11310600	Silent Hill was obviously the last one I saw.
11310600	11311600	That's a good one.
11311600	11312600	I want to go back and watch that again.
11312600	11316920	I thought it was underrated by most people, but whatevs.
11316920	11318440	Different movies for different people, I suppose.
11318440	11319440	All right.
11319440	11320440	Is that it?
11320440	11321440	That's it.
11321440	11322440	We're done.
11322440	11323440	We're out.
11323440	11325880	It's time for us to wrap up the show and say our good nights.
11325880	11330200	Of course, we'll be back here next week with our big pre-E3 show.
11330200	11334040	Some folks are asking for an OLR game the week before E3.
11334040	11336280	We might just have to give them what they want.
11336280	11339440	We are the show where every gamer has a voice after all, so we'll be doing that.
11339440	11341940	We might be actually doing a press conference live.
11341940	11346120	I just have to steal the audio from another site, so we'll have to figure that out.
11346120	11349680	If anybody knows of a site that's doing the audio live Sunday, please...
11349680	11350680	Which one is it?
11350680	11351680	Microsoft?
11351680	11352680	The Cirque du Soleil one.
11352680	11353680	It's the tall one.
11353680	11354680	It'll probably be on Xbox.com.
11354680	11355680	Well, maybe it will be.
11355680	11356880	We can steal the audio.
11356880	11361320	We'll rebroadcast it over here with our own commentary, because it's not stealing if we
11361320	11364140	provide a certain percentage of original content.
11364140	11366340	And Miklotov will be here, and we'll be talking E3.
11366340	11369760	It's going to be a very packed show next week, so stay tuned for that.
11369760	11373760	And of course, thank you guys very much for tuning into our show and downloading it, listening
11373760	11375200	live, however you did.
11375200	11379900	All we ask you guys, if you enjoy what you've heard, please tell two people about our program.
11379900	11384200	Help us spread the word, because we are not a big magazine or a big website.
11384200	11389040	We are by the people, for the people, and we really only get our advertising done via
11389040	11390240	word of mouth.
11390240	11391240	That's it.
11391240	11392800	We don't play any advertising on the show, so that's all we ask.
11392800	11394240	Help us advertise instead.
11394240	11395600	So that's it.
11395600	11399080	We can't close out the show, though, until we go around and give everybody's final thoughts.
11399080	11400760	Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
11400760	11402480	What's your final thought, Loki?
11402480	11404880	My final thought is...
11404880	11407680	I'm going to be busy this week.
11407680	11409440	My final thought is...
11409440	11412400	I want a teriyaki chicken bowl from Jack in the Box.
11412400	11414640	That sounds really good right now.
11414640	11419520	Dark Soccer, what's your final thought?
11419520	11421160	How's that voice coming along good, huh?
11421160	11422160	What voice?
11422160	11423160	You need some WD-40.
11423160	11424160	All right.
11424160	11425260	I've got Ricola.
11425260	11427880	Thank you guys very much for listening once again.
11427880	11428880	Have a wonderful week.
11428880	11432240	We will see you here next week for more of Orange Lounge Radio.
