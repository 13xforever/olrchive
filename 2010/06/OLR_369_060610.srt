00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,720
Tonight, June 6th, 2010, a lawsuit is filed against Final Fantasy XIII.

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,880
Rumors say a new dance game is coming to Project Atoll, and could you soon pay a new tax on

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,760
your consumer electronics?

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,840
Hello my friends and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,720
We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,680
It is episode number 369 for this June the 6th of 2010, 69.

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,400
I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,840
First off, the one, the only, Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Hi.

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
How are you?

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Ahhh.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,520
I see, needing a good oiling apparently.

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,180
This is the first day I've actually felt somewhat decent, so I've been sick, but I am mostly

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,940
over it, a little leftover.

16
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,640
My voice may go out during the show.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
You know what you need?

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
A lozenge.

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,240
You need, well that, and you need salad.

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,040
Because I took, I had salad today.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
I went to, just like, for anybody who listened to last week's show, I went to Fresh Choice,

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
just like Jamie.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,720
I saw your picture of your lovely salad.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,520
I sent you a tweet.

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,400
But I have been eating salad all weekend.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,160
I had an epic salad yesterday, Rob.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Get this.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,560
And so there's different levels of salad.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,900
There's like, you know, there's level one salad, your like basic house salad, then there's

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,920
epic salad of awesomeness.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:49,840
My epic salad had used red vein chard, which chard is delicious, and raw squash, and roma

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:59,160
tomatoes, and dehydrated apples, and chives, and, what else did I put in that thing?

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,880
Because I put a lot of, oh, pea sprouts.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Pea shoots, sorry, pea shoots.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
And broccoli.

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,120
And occasionally we do talk about video games here at Orange Lawns Radio.

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
With a raspberry vinaigrette.

38
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Now is that-

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,840
But don't put your video games in raspberry vinaigrette, it won't work anymore.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Epic.

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
It sounds pretty epic.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
It was really good.

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Alright.

44
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm gonna have gelato today.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,240
Also here, I've got to introduce the one and only tech master, Loki.

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Hello.

47
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
How are you doing, Loki?

48
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
I'm full.

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
You're full?

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
What have you been eating?

51
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Not a salad.

52
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
I can see that.

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
I don't know, breadsticks.

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
Breadsticks.

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,240
Yeah.

56
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
This should be like a food MMO.

57
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
I don't know.

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Let's go to Sizzler, the MMO.

59
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
No.

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Don't need that.

61
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Alright.

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:44,200
Anyhow, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com.

63
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,640
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

64
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,440
So, do pull up a chair and join us in our chat room if you are listening live, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,480
We're gonna be talking video games over the next few hours.

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,520
Tonight, lots of E3 rumors and kind of things.

67
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,480
You know, we're in that period where E3 is, you know, right around the corner.

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,840
Obviously, we're, what, eight days away from the first?

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
No.

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
Actually, we're one week away from the first press conference.

71
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,920
If you count the Cirque du Soleil project, the tall thing, where they're gonna announce

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,600
the real name of it, which I heard a little rumor, take it with a grain of salt, Xbox

73
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Wave.

74
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Oh, no.

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
How would you feel about that as the name?

76
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,960
Do you think that's a good name for a peripheral, Xbox Wave?

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
It's interesting.

78
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
I could see them doing little like tidal waves.

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,260
Jamie's like waving her hand.

80
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,320
At least it's not the Xbox Flail.

81
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,240
That's I guess a little better.

82
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,280
That's, that would be if they put Para Para on it.

83
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
We'll see.

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,680
Take that with a gigantic grain of salt.

85
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,360
I was, I just had a thought about the Natal thing and Para Para.

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
What's that?

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,600
Could you imagine that?

88
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
It could happen.

89
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,880
We actually have a story a little later on about what might be happening with Natal and

90
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
music based games.

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
It's very interesting.

92
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
So we'll be getting into that a little while.

93
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,960
Xbox just made me think about it and I was like, Pala Pala.

94
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,160
This is gonna be a very interesting E3.

95
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,120
Like, you know, last year's, I'm gonna admit, I'm just gonna be honest.

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,840
I was kind of disappointed with last year's E3.

97
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
I mean, sure.

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
So was I.

99
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
I didn't even go.

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
There was a few things that came out of it that were kind of, you know, kind of cool.

101
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,920
But otherwise the show was just kind of like a lot of it was behind closed doors.

102
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,280
A lot of it was more conceptual because you had, you know, Natal and Moov being announced

103
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,280
but nothing, and I guess the Vitality sensor to some extent, but nothing really being shown.

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,840
You know, so I think this year we're really gonna see what is going to be out on the shelves

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
this Christmas.

106
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,400
And there's gonna be a lot fighting for your attention this year.

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It'll be very interesting.

108
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,360
I like when things fight for my attention.

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
All right.

110
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Usually to the death.

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Well, we'll be getting into E3 and rumors and news and all that in just a little bit.

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,400
We are gonna start off tonight's show as we always do, however, with a little bit of how

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
was your gaming week.

114
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,640
So what was fighting to the death for your attention this week in your gaming world,

115
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Dark Sakura?

116
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,520
Well, as I was playing just a moment ago, I was playing some Portal, but I really have

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,080
to owe it to a lot of Star Trek Online because I realized that I had three more ranks to

118
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,520
go before I hit Commander and damn it, I'm almost there because I want that extra pip.

119
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,920
Other than that, I also canned two of my crewmen and now have this weird purple dude or purple

120
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,160
chick who just is bizarre looking, but she's got good stats or whatever.

121
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,800
And I have to say the crystalline entity is a bitch.

122
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
What is that?

123
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Okay.

124
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
What is the crystal?

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I don't.

126
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm not a big enough nerd.

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
It was a next generation foe.

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,860
Okay.

129
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,440
And it's this big crystal thing, spiky crystal thing floating in space.

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280
And in the show, they use a high pitched noisy.

131
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,240
Did they inject the warp core to fix it?

132
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
No.

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Because that's always how you fix the problem.

134
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
You inject the warp core.

135
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
They pretty much screamed at it.

136
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Oh, okay.

137
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Pretty much screamed at it.

138
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,320
They used a high pitch harmonic or something.

139
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,240
So you're saying that the purple chick is a butter face.

140
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
She looks strange, but she has good stats.

141
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,040
Okay.

142
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,680
She has a nice body butter face.

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,400
Is that what it is?

144
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Yes.

145
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Okay.

146
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Whatever.

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Anyway.

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

149
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,760
Do we find a picture?

150
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
No.

151
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,000
Uh, I want to ask you something Star Trek related.

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,560
Have you heard the commercials on the radio?

153
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,280
There is the Star Trek tour is apparently like right around the corner from my house.

154
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
Yes.

155
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
And McClellan.

156
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Yeah.

157
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
That's not giving away where I live on the show, but that's right around the corner of

158
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
my house.

159
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Yeah.

160
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
It's like one exit up the freeway.

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Oh, I didn't know.

162
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Yes.

163
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Oh, I know.

164
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
Sorry.

165
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Well, now you know.

166
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
And now the entire internet knows where I live.

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Send us cards and letters.

168
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
I thought you lived in the butt end the other way.

169
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
No.

170
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,440
Dan's in the other room singing, knowing it's half the battle.

171
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,020
We need to get Dan a mic in the living room.

172
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,920
We need to get like a, we need to get like a really long cord just so Dan can give his

173
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,280
MST 3k commentary during the show for the living room.

174
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Anyway.

175
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,780
Well, why, how have you not gone yet?

176
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,520
Are we going, are we going to have a date?

177
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
I'm going to take you on a date to the Star Trek tour.

178
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,120
Are you going to give me dinner and flowers?

179
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,560
Um, sure.

180
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,280
I'll go steal some flowers from the apartment complex.

181
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,320
I picked them in the front and then, uh, you know, by, by dinner and flowers, um, he's

182
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,360
going to get me that Saturn game where you raise plants and a burger time and then we'll

183
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,640
have some fava beans and a nice can team.

184
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,520
Anyway, um, but what I was thinking about the crystal and this is, this is an open letter

185
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,160
of annoyance to people who play Star Trek online.

186
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,120
First of all, the crystalline entity thing is an open instance.

187
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,180
That means anyone can join it.

188
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,660
Even the most retarded of the retarded, the buttharted can join this instance.

189
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,400
Do not use mines.

190
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Do not use mines.

191
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,800
The way that you beat the stupid thing is you eject the warp core breach.

192
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,200
That's how you kill it.

193
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,320
The way that you kill the thing is that when you get it down to 30% it's going to shoot

194
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,400
out these large crystals.

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,200
Don't shoot the fragments, shoot the big crystals because the big crystals go back and regenerate

196
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,720
the damn thing and then it shoots out everything and kills you.

197
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
We can't do it, captain.

198
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,800
We don't have the power.

199
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,540
Just people think strategy, please.

200
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,760
Does anybody ever yell that in Star Trek online?

201
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,640
We don't have the power.

202
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
No.

203
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,560
I'm sure somewhere somebody has.

204
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,720
They keep mentioning Worf.

205
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,640
And I actually enjoy all the instances that involve the Klingons because they're so much

206
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
fun.

207
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,480
I'm really enjoying the game, okay?

208
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,360
And Rob, you were supposed to play with me.

209
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,720
I will use the pass.

210
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
I will.

211
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,120
Let's just, you know, World of Warcraft addict, et cetera.

212
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
Okay, look.

213
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm looking in our chat room.

214
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

215
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,000
And SSJ100Matt is saying that Tigerclaw has already found my house, apparently.

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, no.

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Loki's house.

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What was it?

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't know.

220
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,600
Well, because Tigerclaw is the expert in our chat room.

221
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Like, if we mention something, he'll have a link in five seconds.

222
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
He's amazing.

223
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,480
His Google flu is unmatched.

224
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
Let's see.

225
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,120
SSJ100Matt also commenting on the date between Dark Soccer and myself.

226
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Rob better put out.

227
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Yeah, Rob.

228
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Yeah.

229
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
Put out the credit card to pay the bill.

230
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
That's what I'll be putting out.

231
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
That's right.

232
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
All right.

233
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Let's see.

234
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
And then, where was there?

235
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
There was another one I wanted to say.

236
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Oh, yes.

237
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,080
BobbyBlackWolf, our old pal buddy friend who does the show before us here at All Games

238
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Radio.

239
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
He is hatin' on split second.

240
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
Like, if you listen to his show tonight, it's just an hour of split second bashing.

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
Not really, but it might as well have been.

242
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,720
He says in his gaming week, he ejected the warp core breach that is split second, because

243
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
he is not a fan, apparently, of split second.

244
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
I have not played split second outside the demo, but maybe next week I'll have more of

245
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,440
an opinion, and I'll either eject Bobby's opinion from the warp core or whatever.

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
I don't know.

247
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
We'll see.

248
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,120
Well, I also have to say the thing that Dan's been playing, because I have totally just

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,660
gotten a kick out of watching him play it.

250
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,120
We don't have the other controller hooked up where I'd play it, because you can play

251
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,880
simultaneous on it, is Super Mario Brothers X.

252
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,360
Speaking of pals from All Games Radio, I noticed Derek H. from Dead Pixel Live is in our chat

253
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,440
room, and if you don't listen to Dead Pixel Live, you're an idiot.

254
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,800
It's on Monday through Thursday at All Games Radio, so they do lots of shows.

255
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,140
And he's asking a good question I want to pose to Jamie.

256
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,020
Is Star Trek Online anything like you're in the show?

257
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,200
I did tell him that it's pretty episode-like and that I love it, but I will give a little

258
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,240
bit more of an apt description.

259
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Okay.

260
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,660
You have, you basically talk to your commanders, you can talk to them, be a subspace, and you

261
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,980
get your missions.

262
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,520
So you go to whatever system, sometimes it's just a patrol, sometimes you think you're

263
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,640
going to some abandoned place to look on some research that you don't know why it killed

264
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,840
everybody, and oh, the Romulans are there.

265
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,080
Which is everything I was doing today.

266
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,820
Sometimes you go, actually we had a Section 31 guy pull like a big double switch.

267
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,080
I don't want to go into detail in case you play the game, because honestly the whole

268
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,640
thing with this game for me is that it really is like, I look forward to the story.

269
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,960
Every mission that you go through through the game forwards the story.

270
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,760
And you know, they do new episodes with new missions and everything, and I think that

271
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,520
that's pretty sweet, but really it's like you're playing through seasons of the show.

272
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
For me, that is.

273
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,960
I mean, and yeah, there's times where I'll scream at the stupid, you know, the Romulan,

274
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,480
the Romulan medics are the worst because like, shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate, shoot, shoot,

275
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,360
shoot, regenerate, shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate.

276
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,680
But they really do, you know, pay a lot of attention to canon in this too.

277
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,520
Like now, I've been reading the books.

278
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,040
Keep in mind, this is a different universe than the books.

279
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,600
The books were written before the new movie came out, and this is incorporating the new

280
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,040
movie into the storyline, so basically Romulus go boom.

281
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,000
Morph gets pissed off at everybody, pissed off.

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,280
It really is like a good continuation, but it says something like 20 years later, so

283
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,720
like you actually run into people who were children in the series.

284
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,120
Like you run into Maral Paris, and you run into Kiriyoshi O'Brien, and it's really neat.

285
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,080
I mean, it really is like being in the universe.

286
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,560
Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.

287
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,680
No, it's cool.

288
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
It's cool.

289
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
I do want to play a little more.

290
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,200
I only played during the beta, and I wasn't totally absorbed with it, so it was the space

291
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,360
combat turned me off.

292
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,280
I liked the away team mode, but I didn't like the space combat at all.

293
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,080
Actually, Rob, they've really, really addressed a lot of problems with space combat.

294
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Okay, cool.

295
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
It's a lot smoother now.

296
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,400
But the other thing too is that once you get a little bit more used to the controls, it

297
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,200
actually is really fluid.

298
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Now, you and I may have had the same problem.

299
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,400
My graphics card was crap.

300
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,520
I fixed that though, and now I can run wow at like highest settings, and it's purty.

301
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Well, then you should have no problem.

302
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,960
When I upgraded my graphics card, a lot of my problems with control stopped because I

303
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
wasn't lagging.

304
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Okay, cool.

305
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,040
Because it would literally, now the difference between graphics card lag is that it would

306
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,360
be stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter.

307
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,680
And internet lag is that you'll go forward, you'll row back a few steps, and you'll go

308
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,440
forward again.

309
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,600
But that's very few and far between.

310
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,680
It's just a little lag, and it looks like you've gone back like a millimeter on the

311
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
screen.

312
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,960
Wow lag can suck when it's like seconds and seconds of lag.

313
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Freeze, freeze, freeze.

314
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,840
Yeah, just everything kind of freezes in place, and then everything happens in like half a

315
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
second.

316
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
I hate it.

317
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Oh, it was bad.

318
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,360
I mean, usually the game doesn't get too laggy, but when you get those lag spikes, oh man,

319
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
world of hurt.

320
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
No, I hated it.

321
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,160
I mean, that was one of the reasons.

322
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,200
I like the lag in Star Trek Online a lot better than the lag in World of Warcraft.

323
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,920
In fact, I actually don't like World of Warcraft, so that helps.

324
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
Well, I tried.

325
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Nine, eight.

326
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,800
I got a character to 20, Rob.

327
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
I know.

328
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
I got one to 20.

329
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I know.

330
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:01,080
So yeah, if anyone wants to play with me, just saying, my whole account name is DarkSakura.

331
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,600
My character's name is Edarn, E-D-A-R-Y-N.

332
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,180
So yeah, I'm playing a Trill, whatever, because Trills are cool.

333
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,360
And so, yeah, we need a fleet, we need the O.L. Army fleet.

334
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
So there you go.

335
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,880
You can stalk DarkSakura on Star Trek Online.

336
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Yeah.

337
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,200
I am right now hanging out in Romulan space.

338
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,880
Anyway, what I was going to say about Super Mario Bros. X.

339
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Yes.

340
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
It's a Flash game.

341
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,120
You go to SuperMarioBrothers.org, and you know, I'll spell it out all over the word.

342
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,680
Not B-R-O-S, not Bros.

343
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
No, not Bros.

344
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,840
You have to do the full brothers.

345
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,560
Brothers, yeah.

346
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,160
But you can download the Flash game.

347
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,440
Dan's actually running it through our computer that's hooked up to our TV, so he plays it

348
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,600
at 52 inch widescreen.

349
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,880
But it's basically a rehashing of the Mario levels and things done in different, like

350
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,560
I love the first game on the list, it's called the Princess Cliche.

351
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,480
But it's basically this guy's made different, you know, Mario, Super Mario games that'll

352
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
have elements from Super Mario World, Super Mario 3s, even the flurries from Super Mario

353
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,840
2 are in the level.

354
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,520
I thought it was a very good looking game, I mean, it just looked like Super Mario World.

355
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,720
At least the little bit I saw, I didn't, you know, Dan tried to show it to me in about

356
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,600
10 seconds, like, you gotta check this out, but I...

357
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,480
He was playing levels last night that are really reminiscent of Super Mario 3.

358
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,800
Well the part that made me go, oh neat, is that it was two players simultaneous.

359
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Yeah.

360
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,360
Kind of like the new Wii game is all simultaneous.

361
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Yeah.

362
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,120
Well, we and I haven't played it together yet, but I have to say that it's, dude who

363
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
made that game, well done.

364
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,440
Very much well done.

365
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,960
Enjoy it while it lasts before Nintendo sues the pants off those people, although there

366
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,520
is a big splash screen that's basically the equivalent of please don't sue me, I love

367
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Nintendo.

368
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
They've been around for a while though.

369
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Has it?

370
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Yeah, it's been around for a while.

371
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah, well, like, the game on, one of the games he has on there is like the first one

372
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,040
he ever did, which is really annoying because all you ever get is mushrooms in it, but it's,

373
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,280
it's really, it's really, he did a great job, like there's this one level that Dan was going

374
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,440
through where you have to, you get the buzzy beetle shells and you have to break purple

375
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
blocks with them so you have to get to the purple blocks and everything to unlock a door

376
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,760
and it really, it's got some definitely creative elements in it, I'm, I'm pretty, I think it's

377
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,240
pretty cool when I have some time that I'm not feeling like, you know, crap, I'll play

378
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
it.

379
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Alright.

380
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,680
Well, let's move on with our gaming weeks.

381
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,440
We're almost 20 minutes, and Darsaki, you played a lot tonight, actually most of that

382
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
was Star Trek Babble.

383
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
That's okay.

384
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
I also still had to do a plug.

385
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Oh, yes.

386
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Well, let's do it during housekeeping.

387
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Okay.

388
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,760
Because I, there, I do want to give that plug as well.

389
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,480
Uh, Loki, what did you, oh, you're, you're chowing down over there.

390
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,840
You ready to talk about gaming week?

391
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Almost done eating.

392
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Alright.

393
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Sorry.

394
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Bad time.

395
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
You want me to go my gaming week then?

396
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
No, I'm ready.

397
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Okay.

398
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Okay.

399
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,000
So this week I played really only three things, um, Red Dead Redemption, played a lot more

400
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,880
system link co-op and the game is surprisingly, I don't know how to really put it, the system

401
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,640
link games, we have trouble staying in the same game, like it will have trouble joining

402
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
a system link game.

403
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,880
I have never seen a game that has trouble joining a system link game.

404
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,640
And the system link game means your Xbox are connected.

405
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,800
You're not even on the internet.

406
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,920
You are literally connected table to table and it's just like, can't find the other Xbox.

407
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,360
It's like, oh, you're in your own game and I have to find a new game.

408
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,880
Oh, you're in your own game again.

409
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Find new game up.

410
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
There he is.

411
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,840
And we're like, we know we finished the mission or whatever co-op mission is split us off

412
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,040
into two different games again.

413
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,020
I'm like, what the hell is wrong with this thing?

414
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,960
But yeah, it's very buggy.

415
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,600
Um, we had issues with, um, where we were playing and we got dynamite and the molotovs

416
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,840
and stuff like that.

417
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:52,280
And it stopped showing us the explosions and the blood splurts and also the fire.

418
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,800
And then my friend had trouble going through a gate because on our screen, the gate was

419
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
open.

420
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
On our screen, the gate was shut and locked.

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
So it was interesting.

422
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,720
But um, yeah, it's, it's still really fun.

423
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,520
Um, I haven't gotten to play a lot of online cause trying to join games online, at least

424
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,480
at our work where connection's not so great.

425
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,880
Um, it's near impossible to do it.

426
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,120
So we just basically stick to System Link games cause at least that way if live drops,

427
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,160
which it does all the time on our, um, connection there at work, it doesn't matter.

428
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,420
So that's kind of fun.

429
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:38,960
And then also this week I went and played, um, some Grand Theft Auto, lost, er, not lost

430
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,920
in damn, but, uh, Battle of the Gay Tony, more of the Episodes of Liberty City stuff.

431
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,320
Um, still playing through that.

432
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm actually still moving up the ranks cause I haven't lost a game in a few weeks.

433
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,920
Um, I'm 63 now, which is pretty cool, and really frustrating the hell out of my coworkers

434
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,800
cause they're getting pissed off now that I don't lose any games.

435
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,720
They're saying, because there was a guy that used to play with us named Chris Marsh and

436
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,300
they're saying he, what I'm doing is very Marshian because he would, you know, pull

437
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,680
off these just crazy ass, um, kills and stuff.

438
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:22,280
Like for example, in the old, um, PSP game, uh, Liberty City Stories, it was very glitched

439
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
out.

440
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,740
I mean we had problems with like teleporting grenades and whatever, um, but he actually

441
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,600
got one kill one time.

442
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,640
He actually got two kills out of one death.

443
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,880
It was just ridiculous because he killed somebody and somehow they had just driven over like

444
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,340
health or something and then they got a second death.

445
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,840
So he got two points for where he should have only gotten one.

446
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,880
I've actually gotten assists off of, um, what was it, assists off of my own death.

447
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,000
So I actually got points for me dying, which makes zero sense whatsoever cause you're not

448
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,280
supposed to be able to do that.

449
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,840
And it's not my fault, it's just the game is really glitchy and, you know, that's just

450
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,560
the way things are.

451
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,440
Speaking of glitchy games, I've gone back to Earth Defense Force 2017 and I am going

452
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,760
to beat it this time.

453
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:16,920
We actually, um, were playing some more and, uh, just going through the game and, uh, almost

454
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,140
finished with the game now.

455
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,320
So I will be finishing that game hopefully soon.

456
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,240
Kind of, uh, just had to dust it off again.

457
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,000
Actually cracked my copy, but thankfully a while back I bought the last three copies

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
we had for five dollars each.

459
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Nice.

460
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,040
So I have spares.

461
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,260
Wow.

462
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,000
You should, I don't know, give one of those away as a prize.

463
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,920
I was playing on it some day, but I cracked the copy.

464
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Endorsed by Loki edition.

465
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
It's awesome.

466
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
I bet the developers would love that.

467
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Alright, uh, anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

468
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,240
Um, that's pretty much it as far as stuff I've played.

469
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,960
I'm kind of working on something right now.

470
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,720
Well, I'm working on a lot of things cause that's just the way things work.

471
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,160
Um, working on painting the baby's room, which is game related because it's New Super Mario

472
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,420
Brothers themed.

473
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
That's gonna be cute.

474
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,920
You just need to put pictures on the, um, LR feed.

475
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,580
Oh yeah, there will be tons of pictures.

476
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,960
That's gonna be pimped out.

477
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,920
We got some of the wall decals, but we're gonna paint a lot of it, but we want the wall

478
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,000
decals for the characters and some of the other stuff.

479
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,320
You're doing Mario you said?

480
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,440
Yeah, New Super Mario Brothers theme.

481
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,840
I have a plan I can give you to make hampers look like the, um, the pipes.

482
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Huh.

483
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
Well, I'll have to look at that.

484
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,160
Cause I was just gonna get giant PVC and make it into a pipe, but.

485
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,440
That was, well, it's something that I had planned cause that's what Dan and I were gonna

486
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
do.

487
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Cool.

488
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,680
And then I got some other stuff from ThinkGeek.

489
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:42,520
Uh, like I got a, it was a open source, uh, music box.

490
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,280
So we have it so that you can make the Super Mario Brothers theme on that.

491
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,640
And then some Mario figurines.

492
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,520
And we're planning on doing some, um, uh, question block shelving and custom carpet

493
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,040
that's, or rug that's gonna have Mario Brothers stuff on it.

494
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,440
Really there is no Mario Brothers furniture out there.

495
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,320
But you would think, you know, with the popularity of Mario Brothers that there would be a ton

496
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
of stuff out there.

497
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,320
But it's not.

498
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,200
There's a lot of handmade stuff on eBay that's just super expensive and really ugly.

499
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,920
But um, yeah, a lot of it's just gonna be handmade and, uh, will be really awesome.

500
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,640
Of course there'll be tons of pictures for it once it does get finished.

501
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,200
Um, the other thing I'm working on right now, and this is just kind of an on a whim thing,

502
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,480
uh, that I decided to do the other day is what, cause I love the, uh, phrasing project

503
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,800
$10 that EA has been using, you know, cause they're charging people lots of money for

504
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,960
stuff that should be in the games in the first place.

505
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:46,920
Um, but I decided to come up with project under $100 and what project under $100 is,

506
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,400
is building a working main cabinet under $100.

507
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,440
And that's including everything, including shipping.

508
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,800
Now, although I'm pricing stuff out now, I don't know if I can include shipping in there

509
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,320
cause it's, I want to do a two player cocktail, but, um, it might be a little difficult.

510
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,240
But basically though, um, you know, involving, uh, actually getting like an LCD monitor,

511
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,120
computer, uh, all the arcade parts and that kind of stuff under $100.

512
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,600
It might end up being $120.

513
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
We'll see.

514
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,440
Uh, after all that stuff, cause like I said, I don't want the extra buttons and joystick

515
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
and stuff.

516
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,360
Uh, so far I have the computer and the monitor for under $70.

517
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,000
So I'm off to a good start.

518
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,120
And um, the cabinet itself will be funny because it will be made out of cardboard.

519
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Nice.

520
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,080
Thanks to the US postal service because you can get a ton of boxes from them for absolutely

521
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,920
free and they ship them to you.

522
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Wow.

523
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,400
That's kind of cool.

524
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Very cool.

525
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,700
Uh, comments from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

529
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,140
Some comments from chat, ssj100matt, uh, talking about the baby room says diapers go in the

530
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,660
chomp chomp bin.

531
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Get it?

532
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,660
Cause yeah.

533
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Yeah.

534
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,660
Yeah.

535
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
All right.

536
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,720
Uh, Derek H says, uh, if he does that, I'm assuming talking about the main cabinet, I'm

537
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
doing it.

538
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
My main cabinet is an old laptop, a monitor and an Xbox 360 controller.

539
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Yeah.

540
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Great.

541
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
I mean, I could have done a lot of stuff.

542
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Hey, I've got some spare parts.

543
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,560
I know this doesn't cost me anything, but I wanted it so that it can be somewhat reproducible

544
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,720
because the problem is though, like shopping on eBay and buying new stuff, you never know

545
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,320
what you're going to get for what price and I mean, you know, ideally you get one day

546
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
is not a deal.

547
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,400
You're gonna get another day.

548
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,560
So I got lucky with some of that stuff.

549
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,860
Like I said, I got a monitor for $32 an LCD monitor, 15 inch LCD monitor that has one

550
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,500
dead pixel, but I don't give a shit.

551
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,440
It's you know, going in a cardboard cabinets, who cares?

552
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:54,400
Um, and I got a computer for $35 that's basically, uh, it's a 1.6 gigahertz processor, which

553
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,480
is fine for MAME and I think a half gig of Ram, which is perfect for MAME.

554
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,240
It's not going to be able to run anything really great, but it's just for MAME.

555
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,560
That's all it really is going to be used for.

556
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:11,660
Um, and then the cabinet itself, I'm kind of wondering, cause I'm not sure if I can

557
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,800
do all of those boxes from the US Postal Service, uh, because they're only about a foot high

558
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,560
and if I want like a cocktail cabinet, it's gotta be a few feet tall.

559
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,640
So I may have to supplement it with some other stuff, but, um, I'm just kind of throwing

560
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
around the idea.

561
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:34,640
We got like this gift card from work for ironically enough selling split second and, um, so I'm

562
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,100
using it for that.

563
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,480
I bet Bobby would be proud to know that you got rewarded for selling extra copies of split

564
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,440
second to people.

565
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Good job, Loki.

566
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,000
It's a, it's a decent game.

567
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,560
I mean, you know, I don't know.

568
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
All right.

569
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Uh, anything else?

570
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Loki.

571
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
That's it.

572
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
All right.

573
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Let me get into, uh, my gaming week.

574
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Cause I, it was pretty busy.

575
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
You know, we haven't been live the past two weeks.

576
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,080
This is our first show live in, I guess what, three weeks then because we had two shows

577
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
off.

578
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,720
We had the show not planned to be off where my car broke down and I wasn't here in time,

579
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,400
but we did have the podcast feed.

580
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,560
So if you haven't heard episode three 68, we taped it later in the week, like a few

581
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,780
days later, it went to the podcast feed.

582
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,720
We couldn't do a live cause there's other all game shows on during the week, but we,

583
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
we taped something and put it to the feet.

584
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,680
Uh, and the Memorial day, we'd always plan to take off.

585
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,800
Well, Memorial day, the reason why we were off, some of us are going on vacation.

586
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,120
Uh, Alan and I went up to Portland and had a really good time, but what I wanted to share

587
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,720
with you guys was this awesome place we found in downtown Portland.

588
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
We had no idea this was there.

589
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,100
I wasn't even looking for it.

590
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Just came across it.

591
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,640
I saw a giant sign with the space invaders on it that said barcade.

592
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,720
And I'm like, no way.

593
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
It's like a bar in an arcade.

594
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,880
And one of our friends that was with us was like, yeah, they have like old games there

595
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,960
and you and I'm like, okay, we're going, we're going, let's go.

596
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,080
It's classic arcade games and beer.

597
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,360
And that's exactly what this place is.

598
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,760
This place called ground control with a K. And I guess actually one thing I didn't realize

599
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,400
it's one of those arcades that's also participating in the save the arcades to campaign.

600
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,040
Uh, we had a story on that a couple of weeks ago because arcade infinity is also competing

601
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
with this place.

602
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,480
Well, I got to tell you, this place was awesome.

603
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,560
I had a good time and, uh, you know, I, I didn't try to talk to anybody or I wasn't

604
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,320
like, you know, I'm from Warren's Laundry, you know, I just, I went in as a, as a patron

605
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,660
and I had a really good time just playing some of the classic games and that's really

606
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
what this place was.

607
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,740
It was full of classic games.

608
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,120
I played burger time.

609
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,520
I played Qbert.

610
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,080
I played, uh, Marvel versus Capcom.

611
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,640
I played pinball, like the upstairs was just pinball, pinball, and more pinball.

612
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,920
I was like, I think I had to, I sent a message to Jamie on Twitter or a text or something.

613
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,160
I was like, Jamie, you have to come here like right now.

614
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,360
Here's pinball everywhere.

615
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,800
I played theater of magic, which is one of my favorite tables they ever did.

616
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,240
And uh, Arabian nights, which is awesome.

617
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,240
That's the one with the giant genie lamp in the middle that spins around when you hit

618
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
it.

619
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
Awesome.

620
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,520
I don't remember seeing it.

621
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
They had a lot.

622
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,040
They had more pinball machines than I've ever seen in an arcade at a lot.

623
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,160
But there were like, somebody asked me if they had space jam.

624
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
I didn't see space jam.

625
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
I did see Dr. Who.

626
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,600
That made me think of you.

627
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,440
They had a Dr. Who table, so that was pretty cool.

628
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,380
The only complaint I have about the place is that the game, the games are packed in

629
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,920
so tight because the real estate there, there's not a lot of it.

630
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,880
There's a lot of like brushing up against strangers and not a lot of elbow room.

631
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,960
I got to say, I was there on a, was I there Friday or Saturday?

632
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,960
No, we drove in Friday.

633
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,360
So it was there Saturday night.

634
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,080
It was pretty hopping.

635
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,560
Like you would think this is kind of a niche thing, but just add booze, you guys.

636
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,480
They have beers on tap and they were, they were a hopping place.

637
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
There were quite a few people in there.

638
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah.

639
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,520
I mean, it's, it's kind of like Dave and Buster's for those of us that are into classic games.

640
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
So I endorse this place.

641
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,160
If you're in the Pacific Northwest, you need to check this place out.

642
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
It's ground control.

643
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
It's a lot of fun.

644
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,520
Um, they do all sorts of theme nights, uh, apparently throughout the month too.

645
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,240
And they have bands that, that perform there and everything.

646
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,540
So I, yeah, I had a good time.

647
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,540
So I'm surprised.

648
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,200
And one thing, and Alan said the same thing, and I commented on this too, is that why in

649
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,040
the hell don't they have this in San Francisco?

650
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,800
Like there's nothing like it in San Francisco.

651
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,360
And you would think of all places, kind of tech central, you know, NorCal would have

652
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,200
something like it, but sadly it does not.

653
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,920
Uh, SJ100Matt says that there is a barcade in New York City, Brooklyn to be exact.

654
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,040
You know, I think I'd heard about that, uh, but I had not been there.

655
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,520
Um, Bond006 in chat says, did you have a geek moment?

656
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,560
Yes, I did have a geek moment when I went in there and squeed.

657
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,240
And I watched my friend, get this guys, I know a long time OLR fans will appreciate

658
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,960
this, they had a DDR Extreme machine that I watched my friend play for only 50 cents.

659
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Good times.

660
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
And no tokens.

661
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,600
They, that was another refreshing theme.

662
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,200
Everything actually ran on quarters and they had to have signs on the machines that say

663
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,580
don't use this for your laundry, buddy.

664
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,740
That's old school.

665
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,740
Good times.

666
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,760
So yes, uh, A++ for ground control and I hope there's more places that spring up like it.

667
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,640
Um, as far as other games that I've played that you don't have to be in Portland in order

668
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,320
to, um, access, I did play a couple of new games since I was in Oregon.

669
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,540
Oregon is infamous for not having sales tax, at least to those of us in California.

670
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,840
So I loaded up on games.

671
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,320
I bought four new games this week.

672
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,360
I bought Blur, Split Second, Red Dead Redemption and Alan Wake.

673
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,560
I bought all of those games so that I could save a little bit on sales tax cause I'm cheap.

674
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,440
Although I bought four new video games.

675
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,440
It wasn't that cheap.

676
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,240
Uh, I played two of them this week cause I didn't have time to do everything and I was

677
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
kind of focusing.

678
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,680
I probably played Blur more than any other game that I got this week.

679
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,120
Um, and Blur is pretty cool.

680
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,380
It is exactly what they are marketing it as in the commercials.

681
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,800
It is Mario Kart meets Burnout.

682
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,000
It is, you know, Mario Kart for grownups, um, but it's, you know, obviously there's

683
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,120
something to be said about the cute factor of Mario Kart.

684
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,720
I don't think that Mario Kart is simply just a kid's game, but if you ever thought, gee,

685
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,720
I'd like to play like old school Burnout, but with powerups, that is exactly why they

686
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
made Blur.

687
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,540
That's, that's the simplest way I could describe it.

688
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,800
It's Burnout with powerups.

689
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,240
Um, and it's a lot of fun.

690
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,880
I think online especially has done very well.

691
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,600
Um, I, I, it's very easy to find a game, join it, you get to vote on the track you want

692
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
to do.

693
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,880
It's kind of very easy to just get in there and play and have some fun online.

694
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,160
There are noob only rooms that are restricted to those that are level 10 and under and I

695
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,240
thought that was good so that you can play with people that are new to the game.

696
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,960
I was actually able to win a game because of that, which shocked the hell out of me

697
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,200
because I never win games on Xbox Live because you're always against some expert.

698
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Um, so I, I, I had a lot of fun with Blur.

699
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,840
I do have some complaints about the game or things they could do better in the sequel

700
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,000
because I, I, I'm, I'm pretty sure there will be a Blur 2.

701
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,820
There deserves to be a Blur 2, um, and, uh, there are some things I would like to see

702
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,440
them do better in the sequel.

703
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,120
First off, my number one complaint about the game.

704
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,360
The soundtrack blows.

705
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,920
Um, it's non-existent in some parts and I don't really know like what the music score

706
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
is.

707
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,760
In some parts, like there's a movie in the beginning that kind of had a cool song I recognized

708
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:56,120
in it that was neat and, and in the opening menus, there's some cool techno songs, but

709
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,920
you would think something with that look of Blur, like the neon, the kind of like F-Zero

710
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,680
but not in the future look that Blur sort of has the burnout meets F-Zero look, uh,

711
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,320
you would think has some type of like techno thumping soundtrack to it, right?

712
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,960
Or something like that's what burnout had.

713
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,440
The burnout tracks, EA tracks, I mean, granted Blur is by Activision, but you would still

714
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,600
expect there to be somewhat of a soundtrack, but it, it wasn't there.

715
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,360
It wasn't notable for me.

716
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,320
And from what I understand, you know, they had this agreement apparently signed where

717
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,660
I guess Crystal Method produced a soundtrack.

718
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,480
I was just expecting something a lot more.

719
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,240
Um, I was tempted just to really use custom soundtracks the whole time.

720
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,160
I was very disappointed in, in what should have been a better soundtrack.

721
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,600
My other complaint is, believe it or not, the graphics are not awesome.

722
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,040
You know, like they're, they're good.

723
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,720
They're definitely next gen.

724
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,040
They're a step above what you're going to see on the Wii.

725
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:56,000
But I wasn't like blown away by the graphics, like, yeah, Blur has this neon thing going

726
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,480
for it, but that neon is often mixed in many stages with Highway 50 going through Nevada,

727
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,160
like that very brown, blonde, dusty kind of theme, which I don't know what they were trying

728
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,920
to go for with it, but it, it didn't make the graphics look that notable.

729
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:17,760
Honestly, the graphics were kind of comparable to Fuel, which didn't really have A++ graphics

730
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
either.

731
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
So I was a little bit disappointed.

732
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,960
But in the end, graphics and sound are not the only important things in a video game,

733
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,800
and the game itself is still a lot of fun, and I am having fun making my way through

734
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
it.

735
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,920
I am deserving of a sequel.

736
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,880
I hope they just put a little more polish on it next time.

737
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,040
That is what I would hope for.

738
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,880
Comments from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

739
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,480
Bond006 says, has anyone seen the underhand slap at Ninty, Nintendo, in the Blur ad at

740
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
the end?

741
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,280
Oh yeah, I think the Blur ad is great, and it's really perfect for what Blur is trying

742
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
to be.

743
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Awesome.

744
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,980
Deathwishing says, the graphics are better than Fuel.

745
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,880
Trust me, I loved Fuel.

746
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
I liked Fuel a lot too.

747
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,640
I thought Fuel was severely underrated.

748
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,400
But Fuel was also, the biggest problem with Fuel is that it was too ambitious, and there

749
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,240
wasn't enough polish because the world was too big in Fuel.

750
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,760
That was its biggest problem.

751
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,840
Its ambition was its own worst enemy.

752
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,500
And to some extent, maybe that was the biggest problem with Blur is that they spent so much

753
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,320
time on the game itself, which is where you should spend the time, don't get me wrong.

754
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,300
I think some of the graphics and sound I think suffered a little bit.

755
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,600
But let me say this too, because this is important.

756
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,800
One feature that's in Blur that I think a lot of people overlook, that does make it

757
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,760
pretty awesome, and may explain why the graphics take a hit, it does have split screen multiplayer.

758
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,220
So you don't just have to play this game on Xbox Live.

759
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:49,200
You can play, like Mario Kart, two people on one screen.

760
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,520
So that's kind of cool.

761
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,040
So, you know, take it with a grain of salt, I suppose.

762
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,160
Maybe that's why they had to make some concessions with the graphics and sound.

763
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,560
The other game I played this week, Red Dead Redemption, which might surprise some of you

764
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,560
guys who listen to this show.

765
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,720
It's not usually the type of game I would play, but the reviews on it have been so stellar,

766
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,640
and I've read such good things on it, I'm like, I have to pick this up and know what

767
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
I'm missing.

768
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,480
I'm gonna be honest, I haven't played a whole lot of this story, because I can't stop shooting

769
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,940
random people.

770
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:22,240
That's right, the minute they gave me a gun, I just walk up to random townspeople and shoot

771
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
them.

772
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,840
And I'm trying to find out all the different ways to kill them.

773
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,560
Like, you can shoot them in the face, or run up to them and shoot them in the stomach,

774
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,480
and I laugh maniacally every time to the point...

775
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,640
You need to get the lasso.

776
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,560
That's what I'm hearing, everybody tells me that.

777
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,520
Once you get the lasso...

778
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,200
Dan just said the same damn thing when I walked in there.

779
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
It's just...

780
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,480
Okay, my sister came over, she's been playing Red Dead Redemption as well, because I got

781
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,840
her a copy, and she just comes over and just can't stop laughing at what she's been doing.

782
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,080
She says one of the things she likes doing is lassoing a coyote and dragging it into

783
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:01,280
the middle of town, and then letting it go, because it will attack whatever it sees.

784
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,280
That's pretty funny.

785
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,800
And then you can tie people up, throw them on the train tracks, you can tie people up

786
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,760
and push them off a hill.

787
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,600
My favorite is calling my horse over while I'm standing next to a cliff and it just dives

788
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,680
off the cliff, because it's just stupid.

789
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,240
Honestly, here it is with Red Dead Redemption.

790
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,080
It's sandbox gaming at its finest.

791
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
It really is.

792
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,800
If you've ever wanted one of that Wild West sandbox...

793
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Grand Theft Horse.

794
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
There you go.

795
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Grand Theft...

796
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Well, it is.

797
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
It's the same engine.

798
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
It's that rock star engine...

799
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Rage.

800
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Yeah, Rage.

801
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
They're proprietary engines.

802
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
And they're euphoria.

803
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,840
Tigerclaw says, wow, sky is sadistic, very uncharacteristic of you.

804
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Dude, I just...

805
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,240
I don't play these games an awful lot, but when I do, it's really funny.

806
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,120
I don't take it seriously.

807
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,740
You guys know how...

808
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,680
I know a lot of you guys must be kind of like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

809
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,960
Isn't Rob the same guy who went off on the Saw movies and now he doesn't like them because

810
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
they're too violent?

811
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,860
Well, yeah, but Saw is kind of like realistic and like Red Dead Redemption, like the graphics

812
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,900
are good and all, but it's not realistic.

813
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,960
You know what I mean?

814
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
There's a difference.

815
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
There's a huge difference.

816
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,280
I can't explain it.

817
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,680
If it makes me a hypocrite, well, screw you.

818
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,360
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what would your mother say about this?

819
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,880
Rob, that's just gross, Rob.

820
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,240
My mom said we could call her by the way.

821
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Really?

822
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
We're going to have to do that.

823
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
I don't know if we should do it tonight.

824
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
I'm going to say next week.

825
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
We should.

826
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Yeah.

827
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
And if you...

828
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Let's do it after E3 because I think the next two... because next week is the Microsoft

829
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,680
thing, but definitely in the near future, we will make that work.

830
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,080
Kitsune says, Red Dead Redemption feels so much more fun than Grand Theft Auto IV though.

831
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,980
You know, I kind of agree.

832
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,640
I don't know what it is, Kitsune.

833
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,960
I feel the same thing.

834
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,760
There's something about it where I don't know if it's just the environment or it's just

835
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,280
the story or I just get drawn into Red Dead Redemption a lot more and I do Grand Theft

836
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Auto IV.

837
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
I don't know.

838
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,040
Deathwishing in chat says, Rob, I got mauled by 13 cougars at once.

839
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
That's awesome.

840
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,480
I was instantly thinking of...

841
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,180
I was instantly thinking of Courtney Cox in Cougar Town.

842
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,180
Is it just me?

843
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,180
Is it just me?

844
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,440
I was thinking of Blanche because you know she...

845
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Blanche.

846
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
Ah, rest in peace, Blanche.

847
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I know.

848
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
I know.

849
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
I miss those old broads.

850
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
All right.

851
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,640
But Betty White has outlasted them all.

852
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
That's right.

853
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
There can be only one.

854
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,080
And Betty White has proved she's the HBIC.

855
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
That's right.

856
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
Okay.

857
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,480
That's pretty much it for my gaming week.

858
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,160
We're literally 40 minutes into the show.

859
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,680
Haven't touched a damn bit of news.

860
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,720
So let me do some quick housekeeping, guys.

861
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,280
There's some new articles at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

862
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,160
There's been some great, great retro reviews, retro rear views written in the past couple

863
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
of weeks.

864
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,520
It's been done by baseballs, got some gameplay.

865
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,840
There's a story on Metal Gear.

866
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,000
A new segment that's being done by ActDeft called Video Stumble, which is kind of neat.

867
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So check that out, guys.

868
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,760
Our website is expanding with all this kind of retro-ish content, and I thought that was

869
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
really cool.

870
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,320
I also uploaded some pics from my Portland trip.

871
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,600
If you want to see the picture of the Burger Time machine and the OLR initials, I put those

872
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,400
up at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, so check those out.

873
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,400
I also want to give a plug.

874
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,200
Maybe I'll let Jamie plug this, but she wrote a great article on our friend website.

875
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,560
I don't want to say our sister website, but our BFF website.

876
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
We'll say that.

877
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,200
Our BFF at Geek-Life.com.

878
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,600
Tell them a little bit about what you did, DarkSucker.

879
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:24,560
Well, actually, I have a regular panel on there every week on Tuesday that's called

880
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:32,520
Geek Cube, talking about how to incorporate your geeky life with your work life.

881
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,760
But I also write other articles, like I did a review of this place called Fairy Tale Town

882
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,480
for little kids.

883
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:46,320
But I also did a write-up for OrangeLoungeRadio, since we get a nice big plug on the website.

884
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:54,160
So I just basically kind of did the not-so-secret origin of OrangeLoungeRadio.

885
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,120
Well, it was a historical type of thing, and kind of went through how we evolved from the

886
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,240
show that was on the living room floor about DDR and 2DX to the show we are today.

887
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
It was pretty cool.

888
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,240
I mean, and really, it's the question, you know, we get asked it fairly often, like,

889
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,480
how'd you come up with that name, and how'd you come up with this, and how long you been

890
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,840
doing this, and what was it like, and blah, blah, blah.

891
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,240
And there's a few of you who've been here since, you know, episode one, which I think

892
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,680
are all in this room, and two people in chat.

893
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:33,440
So but, you know, I really just wanted to go through and sort of give, you know, a little

894
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,280
origin story, you know, how we evolved, how we've gotten to where we are now.

895
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,800
By the way, I hear DarkSakura might not be the only OLR host writing something for Geek

896
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
Life.

897
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Wahaha.

898
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Uh-huh.

899
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Uh-huh.

900
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
I'll give you a hint.

901
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
It's not me.

902
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,400
Well, just to go ahead and do the call-out, we are looking for people to contribute content.

903
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,080
Just basically go to geek-life.com, and we have a little link on there for submissions

904
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,800
so you can submit to our will.

905
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,240
Although I really need to be writing stuff for orangelawnsradio.com, too.

906
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
Yes, I do.

907
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
And we don't want to sadly neglect that.

908
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Well, we can, we can.

909
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,360
But we've got great fan staff that's been doing a good job, so props to all of those

910
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,360
kids.

911
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:23,080
But yeah, keep a look out because, you know, and also you may see a few things cross-posted.

912
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Very cool.

913
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,680
I'm actually going to have an interview up on the site next week, next week I hope.

914
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Interview, interview.

915
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,480
With Jim McCann, who wrote New Avengers The Reunion and is writing the current Hawkeye

916
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,920
Mockingbird and the Dazzler one-shot that was fabulous.

917
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Geek Life, indeed.

918
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,120
Well, and that, that and he's just a really, really cool person, so.

919
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Sounds like fun.

920
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
All right.

921
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Geek-life.com.

922
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
The dash is important.

923
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,760
What happens if they don't put the dash in?

924
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Do they get porn?

925
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Probably.

926
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
All right.

927
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Let's see.

928
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Geek is porn?

929
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
Could you imagine?

930
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Oh, it's probably is there.

931
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,880
You know, actually, I don't know if you've noticed, but your ads on Geek Life, a lot

932
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,200
of them are for geek dating sites.

933
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
I don't know if you've noticed.

934
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Yeah.

935
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Yeah.

936
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,200
There you go.

937
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,320
So, and again, if you do click on ads, does, does, does it, does, does Maren get some kickback

938
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
for the click, ad clicking?

939
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,200
I think it's, yeah, I think it helps cover the site.

940
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Just goes to pay for the site.

941
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,040
So, click on ads and have a good time.

942
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
All right.

943
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,160
Hey, I want to mention this too, because I got asked about this earlier tonight.

944
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,360
I don't have a lot to say on this yet, but we were asked, apparently All Games Radio

945
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,040
is putting together this thing called The Big Battle.

946
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,920
And I was asked if we are participating.

947
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,320
I literally found out about this today.

948
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,380
But from what I understand in a nutshell, it is a bunch of the shows at All Games Radio

949
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,380
kind of getting together.

950
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,400
And it's kind of one of those things that when you hear the idea, you're kind of like,

951
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,080
this should have been done like two years ago.

952
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,360
Like, how obvious is this?

953
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,760
And why haven't we done something like this a while ago?

954
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,160
But our props, I don't know who is spearheading this.

955
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,720
I think it might be Dead Pixel Live.

956
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
I don't know.

957
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,260
But props to them for putting it on.

958
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:02,040
It's going to kind of bring the All Games community together in big battles on games.

959
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,320
I can't 100% for sure confirm our participation yet, because I have to talk to Dark Soccer

960
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
on Loki after the show.

961
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,520
See what we can do.

962
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,640
But why wouldn't we?

963
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,640
I mean, really.

964
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,920
I mean, I'm all about like trying to promote the All Games Network and other shows.

965
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,040
And I think a lot of our greatest listeners has come from the cross kind of pollination

966
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,160
of the shows.

967
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,080
And I've always said, I realize Orange Lounge Radio is not for everybody.

968
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,560
There's some games we just don't really talk about here on the show.

969
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Like Madden.

970
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,720
Actually, we have a Madden story tonight, funny enough.

971
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,320
Usually, we don't talk a lot about the sports games like Madden.

972
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,720
But there's other shows on the network.

973
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,160
They talk about that a lot.

974
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,080
And they probably would go, DDR?

975
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,240
What are those guys doing?

976
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:48,080
So if you don't like us, surely there's another show on the network that caters to your interest.

977
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,600
So I'm definitely all about that.

978
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,400
So sure, I'm sure we're going to participate.

979
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,280
It's just a matter of figuring out what games we will actually be able to play.

980
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,060
However, as I understand it, this is not just a host versus host thing.

981
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,520
This is a listener versus listener thing.

982
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,840
So we're going to need you, OL Army, to sign up and represent us in some of these games.

983
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,560
So I will hopefully have more details for you on that next week.

984
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,440
Again, I'm not confirming our participation, but I'm just saying, it's probably going to

985
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
happen.

986
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
All right.

987
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,240
Anyhow, hopefully I didn't say too much on that.

988
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,560
But somebody asked in chat earlier, and I think the All Games folks know what's going

989
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
on, so whatevs.

990
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,000
Also, the other thing I want to plug.

991
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,680
E3 is coming up next week.

992
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,280
Believe it or not, E3 is kind of starting on a Sunday this year.

993
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,280
I mean, not officially.

994
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,240
The show itself does not start on a Tuesday.

995
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,520
But while our show is going on, did you guys know, at I think about 8 o'clock Pacific,

996
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,920
I could have the time wrong, but that is Xbox, Microsoft's Project Natal Cirque du Soleil

997
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,280
show is a week from right now.

998
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,000
So we're actually going to be here.

999
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,520
We will be doing a show.

1000
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,800
We may cut live to the press conference if we can get some coverage.

1001
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,720
We will figure out how we can do that.

1002
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,320
I don't know if it's going to be much besides a show.

1003
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,000
I don't know what's all involved with that, but we will try to figure that out and bring

1004
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,780
you that live next week.

1005
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:17,320
Also here live next week, speaking of old school OLR, an old familiar guest of the show,

1006
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,360
Miklotov, is going to be here because he's going to E3 with me.

1007
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,640
So we don't leave till Monday night, so we will be here Sunday.

1008
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,400
We are not going to miss any OLR because of E3.

1009
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,120
In fact, there might be bonus OLR on the feed.

1010
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:36,880
I wouldn't see why myself and Miklotov and maybe Loki and DarkSakura via phone, depending

1011
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,160
on what we can do, or at least Bobby BlackWolf, I'm sure, if he's not too busy with all his

1012
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,260
appointments, will do some little mini podcast that will go to the feed during E3.

1013
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,260
So that'll be fun.

1014
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:52,200
Loki, I know you'll be hitting refresh on the sites nonstop, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

1015
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,480
Now here's what I'm going to be doing during the week.

1016
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,760
And this is sad because I'm not very productive during E3.

1017
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,040
I watch the live conferences at my desk.

1018
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Good times.

1019
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,920
Or, yeah, I refresh on like four different live feeds at once.

1020
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,800
I'd like to be able to stream it on my iPhone.

1021
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,960
I might be able to.

1022
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,000
Our internet's that crappy at work, so why not?

1023
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,480
All right, lots of housekeeping.

1024
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,080
Now we can finally get to gaming news.

1025
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,080
Hey, hey, hey.

1026
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,080
Gaming news.

1027
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,080
Oh, yeah, on Facebook.

1028
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,080
Facebook.

1029
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,080
Add us on Facebook.

1030
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,080
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1031
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,560
Twitter.com slash OLR.

1032
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,560
Have I named everything?

1033
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,800
I think I have.

1034
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,720
Let's get into the freaking show already.

1035
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,680
Loki, what is going on in gaming news?

1036
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,320
You know, I guess I could take time off during E3, too, because I do have a lot of time off.

1037
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,640
You should have just gone to the, well, you got your wife and the baby.

1038
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,360
She would not let me go to E3.

1039
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,280
She's having nightmares about me going to E3.

1040
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,280
I know, I know.

1041
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,720
Not nightmares, but dreams of which she is mad at me afterwards.

1042
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
I know.

1043
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,720
Oh, well.

1044
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,720
Maybe next year.

1045
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Yeah, next.

1046
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,720
Well.

1047
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Maybe not.

1048
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
Maybe in three years.

1049
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,720
Never.

1050
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,720
Yeah.

1051
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,600
So anyways, there's a rumor going around that Harmonics is working on a dancing game for

1052
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,240
Natal.

1053
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:15,800
And this is becoming, I guess, obvious due to some licenses that they are acquiring for

1054
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:22,280
different danceable tracks, including Cascada's Evacuate the Dance Floor, Timberland's The

1055
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
Way I Are.

1056
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
Wait a minute.

1057
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,560
This came up a couple weeks ago, I think, some of these licensing things.

1058
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,760
So now we've got clarity to what's being used for?

1059
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,880
Well, they're just guessing, I think, based on the fact that it's danceable music.

1060
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,080
I'm hoping for a DJ game.

1061
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,120
I remember that Timberland thing coming up before.

1062
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,760
So I think some of this is just, but I don't remember Cascada.

1063
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,640
I would remember something like that.

1064
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,640
Interesting.

1065
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,640
Yeah.

1066
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:51,800
And they're, you know, not really saying, this is coming also from Game Informer, the

1067
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,360
rumor that they're saying they're working on a dancing game.

1068
00:47:55,360 --> 00:48:00,320
You know what, it makes sense if you think about it, because what game, you know, last

1069
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:05,880
fall was just incredibly popular, in fact, I think it's still popular now, that I would've

1070
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:11,120
never pegged to be at the top of some of these selling lists, and that would be Just Dance

1071
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:16,600
from Ubisoft, which is basically a game where you dance around to cues on the screen.

1072
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:22,000
And it makes sense that you would use this for, like, Natal or something.

1073
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I don't know.

1074
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,600
I mean, it's not a big surprise to me, and I'm sure with Natal, and probably the same

1075
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:33,040
with the move, you're gonna see lots of these really gimmicky things that the Wii has had

1076
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,040
forever.

1077
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,400
Yeah, but, I mean, Loki, to be fair, that gimmicky game is kind of the roots of our

1078
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,400
show.

1079
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,720
I mean, DDR was a bit of a gimmicky game.

1080
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,680
I understand that, but there's a difference between, you know, following cues on screen,

1081
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,680
like, you know, arrows going down the screen, and you actually have to hit them in time

1082
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:53,280
with the beat, versus, I'm watching a person dance on screen, and I'm trying to emulate

1083
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,280
what they're doing on screen.

1084
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,600
I can watch MTV and do that, okay?

1085
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,000
I don't have to pay for a game.

1086
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,520
I get that, Loki, but here's the place where I have a little more hope than I do with all

1087
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,200
the rest of that, is the fact that Harmonix is rumored to be tied into this.

1088
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,240
Harmonix, I'm trying to think here, have they ever made a bad music game?

1089
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,120
Just a straight up bad music game?

1090
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,760
I can't think of one.

1091
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,560
Maybe the chatters will jump in, but Harmonix makes pretty good games.

1092
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,560
Guitar Hero.

1093
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,400
Well, but, well, the first Guitar Hero was revolutionary, and so the second one was good

1094
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,560
too, and then they jumped ship and made Rock Band.

1095
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:32,000
They didn't have anything to do with the third thereafter, remember that?

1096
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,440
So, I mean, Harmonix, the fact that they're involved gives me a little more hope.

1097
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,600
I mean, if you think about it, Rock Band 3, I mean, how much more programming is Rock

1098
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Band 3 gonna take?

1099
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,080
I mean, it's probably just the Beatles and Green Day Engine souped up a little more with

1100
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,960
the keyboard, whatever's put in, you know, a little more something-something there.

1101
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,600
There's probably something else being cooked up over there.

1102
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,220
This makes perfect sense that this would be it.

1103
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,480
And who's to say that it's not necessarily a game like DDR?

1104
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:05,840
I mean, if Natal is supposed to be this magic thing that knows where you are in the room,

1105
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,440
it could work just like DDR with no dance pad.

1106
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,480
That's gonna look weird if it works like...

1107
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,600
I don't know.

1108
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,600
I think it's just gonna be just like Just Dance.

1109
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:23,160
I mean, it's probably not gonna be any more elaborate than that.

1110
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,480
It'll just be interesting because you'll be able to do multiplayer and that kind of stuff,

1111
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,500
and it'll be more accurate because it's using a camera instead of just sensors in a close

1112
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,560
approximation of whatever you're doing.

1113
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:39,080
Maybe the joke is that these are actually tracks for Rock Band 3, because Rock Band

1114
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,840
3 will also be incorporating dancers.

1115
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,800
Or maybe they're working on a DJ game.

1116
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Perhaps.

1117
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,800
Because they never said anything.

1118
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,200
They're just saying, oh, it's gonna be an Natal-based dance game.

1119
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,840
And I don't know if they're just guessing because, you know, Natal coming out soon,

1120
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,800
and the fact that those types of games have done well in the past, and also because these

1121
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,800
are danceable tracks.

1122
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,680
I mean, there's a lot of speculation going on, unless they know something that we don't.

1123
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:13,440
But being the expert analyst that I am, I'm sure it'll be something gimmicky.

1124
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,960
Miklotov is actually in our chat room tonight, and he says, Rock Band Unplugged sucked.

1125
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,200
Well, I mean, opinion is relative or whatever, but I actually disagree.

1126
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,360
I think Rock Band Unplugged, it wasn't Rock Band.

1127
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:28,880
It was frequency amplitude PSP with rock songs, but I didn't think it was bad at all.

1128
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,240
And actually, the really cool thing about that game, remember, it was totally free.

1129
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,840
The demo would work with the download songs, remember that?

1130
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
Yep.

1131
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
Good times.

1132
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
So.

1133
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,280
Blaze in our chat room says, maybe we'll finally get a Dance Mania-esque game.

1134
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,080
Well, I mean, if these are the licensed songs, though, Blaze, I don't know if you're really

1135
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,660
getting a Dance Mania-esque game.

1136
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:52,360
Or are you thinking of Dance Maniacs, because there's Dance Mania, the CDs that inspired

1137
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,360
the VR.

1138
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,360
I think he's thinking Dance Maniacs.

1139
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,360
Maybe he's thinking Dance Maniacs.

1140
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,060
I'm gonna be honest.

1141
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,060
I hope not.

1142
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,240
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1143
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,880
I like Dance Maniacs for what it was, but it's a little bit gimmicky, and I think it's

1144
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,880
a $60 game.

1145
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,880
The technology's old.

1146
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,040
I just don't see it.

1147
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,960
And the technology's old, and they're not gonna do anything like that anymore, because

1148
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,440
now you can do full dancing games, because they have all these fun sensors that they

1149
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,440
can use.

1150
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,120
Couldn't they do better things with a Dance Maniacs-style soundtrack?

1151
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,880
I think that's what we should be looking for.

1152
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:27,040
I think we, especially as music game fans, I mean, OLR's been on for, what, eight years,

1153
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,080
and DDR was started in 1998.

1154
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,160
I mean, we've really got to start looking forward, not trying to emulate what's happened

1155
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,160
in the past.

1156
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
I think they-

1157
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,640
And this is where Konami is failing miserably, by the way.

1158
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,440
What happened to DDR out of Konami?

1159
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,320
I mean, I don't want to spoil a story that's coming up later in the show, but we're gonna

1160
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,400
be talking about the games that are gonna be shown at E3 this year.

1161
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,680
I noticed DDR was not on the list from Konami.

1162
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,120
I'm starting to wonder if that project was canceled.

1163
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,160
Enter Harmonix!

1164
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,280
Just like they did with Guitar Hero.

1165
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,280
I just-

1166
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,280
Time to start looking forward with our music game.

1167
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,640
I just don't understand how they can screw that up so much.

1168
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:08,880
I mean, the problem, I think, with DDR is they need new blood in the game, basically.

1169
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,920
They need someone, like myself, to come in and just completely overhaul the damn game,

1170
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,760
because what they're doing now, it's just not working.

1171
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,160
So they need to go back to square one and just-

1172
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,720
Maybe game companies, and maybe I'm giving this with too few examples, but maybe game

1173
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,840
companies are finally kind of starting to listen to what the fans want a little bit.

1174
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,200
And so Harmonix is like, gosh, the DDR fans kind of want something new.

1175
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,200
Here you go.

1176
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,940
Just like the Blur people were like, gee, people want to burn out Mario Kart game.

1177
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,940
Here you go.

1178
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,940
You know?

1179
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,940
I don't know.

1180
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,940
Maybe it's just me.

1181
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,800
It seems like there seems to be a lot more fan service.

1182
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:54,360
You're hearing a lot more, too, about old-ass games coming back from the dead on the iPhone

1183
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,560
or on DS, and you've seen that a lot lately.

1184
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
Unless it's Earthbound.

1185
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,160
Happy birthday, by the way, Earthbound.

1186
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,720
It's smart that they do listen to their fans, the people that are buying their games, to

1187
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:13,280
make stuff that they intend on purchasing instead of, oh, I don't know, let's recreate

1188
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,160
Karaoke Revolution again.

1189
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
Yeah.

1190
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,200
I remember that, because now instead of calling it Karaoke Revolution 4 or whatever the hell

1191
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,800
number they were up to, oh, they're just going to re-release this, or release a new game

1192
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,120
called Karaoke Revolution, and it's not going to be very different.

1193
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,580
It's supposed to have had all this support with download content, but that never happened.

1194
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:38,920
So I just can't buy what Konami's selling nowadays.

1195
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,960
I mean, I don't know.

1196
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,960
We'll see.

1197
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,760
Well, E3 could surprise us.

1198
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,760
Castlevania, because apparently that Castlevania game, the multiplayer one, is really legit,

1199
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,400
and it should be super awesome.

1200
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:57,840
No, I mean, the Silent Hill game got some good feedback on the Wii.

1201
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:03,160
Konami's got some hype points, but there's just, unfortunately for those of us that liked

1202
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:06,400
a certain aspect of what they were doing many years ago, that is no longer one of their

1203
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,400
hype points.

1204
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,120
You need to bring the Silent Hill and the Metal Gear Solid arcade games to the Wii.

1205
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,160
Or actually now you can bring them out to the PS3 and the Xbox 360, because that'd be

1206
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
awesome.

1207
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
Take a cue from Sega.

1208
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,880
Look at House of the Dead 2 and 3.

1209
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,120
Awesome game, sold well.

1210
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:25,360
Take a cue from that company who's doing the Rock of the Dead.

1211
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,120
That's even cooler.

1212
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,360
Come on.

1213
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,360
Come on.

1214
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,360
Don't do that look.

1215
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,360
No, we shouldn't encourage conspiracy.

1216
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,900
Yeah, the concept's cool.

1217
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,480
It's going to suck, though, unfortunately.

1218
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,920
Bond 006 and Chad seems to have a differing opinion on what I was saying about the fans

1219
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,920
service.

1220
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,640
Tell me about the company kissing the fan's ass.

1221
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,480
I take offense to Capcom making Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

1222
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,720
I enjoyed 10 years of utter arrogance in telling my friends there will never be Marvel vs.

1223
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,640
Capcom 3.

1224
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,800
I think you gave another good example of fan service right there.

1225
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,760
Like it or not, here it comes, right?

1226
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,760
Four words.

1227
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,880
Never say never ever.

1228
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,160
Especially in gaming, right?

1229
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:12,320
Especially with companies buying each other and people acquiring licenses that once were.

1230
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,920
Like who would have thought, going back a few months, who would have thought we would

1231
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,720
have ever got a sequel to Blaster Master?

1232
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,720
I mean, right?

1233
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,820
I mean, granted, it was not as good as it could have been, but it was a sequel to Blaster

1234
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,820
Master.

1235
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:30,200
If DC and Marvel can hook up, anything's possible.

1236
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,040
Buying a commando re-armed, that's all I have to say.

1237
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,600
That was awesome.

1238
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,880
Sin and Punishment Sky successor from Ray Ayanami in chat, that's true, that's Sin and Punishment

1239
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,880
games all.

1240
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,880
And, you know, what's sad about that is it's not gonna sell well, and it's gonna be considered

1241
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,840
probably a failure on Nintendo's part, and you won't see that many games like that.

1242
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,080
Big words, Loki, what's to say that?

1243
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,080
Why you say that?

1244
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:59,840
Because every single mature or niche game on the Wii has not sold well.

1245
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,960
All of them.

1246
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,080
Think about this topic for next week.

1247
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,560
I don't want to get into it tonight because we're running a little long anyway, but just

1248
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,800
think about this topic for next week and write it down mentally in case I forget, because

1249
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,560
I want to go through the different three press conferences, and I want to kind of ask this

1250
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,520
question, and maybe this is a good email topic, too, for those of you guys who want to email

1251
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,800
us this week, mailbagorangeandreadea.com, because we're gonna talk a lot pre-E3 next

1252
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,800
week.

1253
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,880
What could the big three do, Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, at their press conferences to make

1254
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,580
you a rabid fanboy all over again?

1255
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:32,160
And silly answers are fine, but give me some serious ones, too.

1256
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,480
I'm gonna tell you right now what Sony's gotta do, and it's so simple and so obvious.

1257
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,040
All right, all right, but now I want to change topics, because I don't want to ruin next

1258
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,040
week.

1259
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,360
And I feel really bad for not knowing the guy's name, but the guy that they have in

1260
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,960
their commercials right now needs to be running that damn conference.

1261
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,960
Really?

1262
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,960
Yeah.

1263
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,960
Interesting.

1264
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,640
He's the best marketing campaign ever for Sony.

1265
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,080
I would actually agree.

1266
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:03,080
For a company that's had lots of missteps, lots of missteps, remember the black and white

1267
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,080
PSP?

1268
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Yeah?

1269
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,080
Remember that?

1270
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,080
Yeah.

1271
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
Remember the God of War lamb being served up?

1272
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,080
Yeah.

1273
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,080
For a company...

1274
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,080
Cover the crane, baby.

1275
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,080
Yeah.

1276
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,720
This is a direction they should stick with.

1277
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,720
I'll give you that.

1278
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,400
I totally agree, and I'm sure that guy will be at E3.

1279
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,800
Yeah, Kevin Butler, I think, was his name, or whatever.

1280
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,800
Yeah.

1281
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,160
He'll be there.

1282
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,480
And our chat is lighting up.

1283
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Kevin Butler.

1284
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,480
He's great.

1285
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,680
He's the man, says Blaze.

1286
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,680
Black Wolf says he's an actor.

1287
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,120
I hope he does the intro.

1288
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,120
I don't care.

1289
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,120
I just hope he's there.

1290
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
We'll see what happens.

1291
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,680
All right, let's move on, though, guys.

1292
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:36,680
We'll talk a little more E3 next week.

1293
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,520
In fact, I hope he's in every press conference.

1294
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,600
Here's one of the rumors about what's going to be seen.

1295
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,960
Big, big, fat rumor, but it's kind of one of those rumors you look at and go, okay,

1296
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,400
I can see that.

1297
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:53,700
Apparently Hulu is being teased as a possible addition to the Xbox 360.

1298
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,640
This is coming from Gear Live, which is a tech site.

1299
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:00,560
Apparently they have picked up on a rumor that Hulu's streaming functionality, it's

1300
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,240
going to be in the Xbox 360, it's going to be announced at E3.

1301
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,480
One Up ran with the same rumor, saying that a Hulu application for the Xbox 360 definitely

1302
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:16,720
exists, but the problem right now, it's tied up with rights issues.

1303
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,000
Everybody wants a piece of the rights to the application.

1304
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
What do you guys think?

1305
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Hulu on the 360.

1306
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,960
Again, for those of you that don't know Hulu, Hulu's a website.

1307
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,040
It was kind of launched as a competitor to YouTube, but instead of focusing on user-based

1308
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,960
content, it kind of takes your favorite TV shows.

1309
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:38,000
What I like best, a lot of old TV shows are showing up on there, too.

1310
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,180
When I say old, I mean old and forgotten.

1311
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:47,640
One of the awesome shows that's on there right now, the Dark Shadows revival from 1990 is

1312
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,280
on Hulu, all of the episodes.

1313
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,280
I know.

1314
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,280
It's awesome that it's there.

1315
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:56,160
I mean, prepare to be disappointed by the cliffhanger ending, because the show got canceled

1316
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,160
midway through.

1317
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,200
But, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff like that that I think would be a great addition

1318
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,880
to the Xbox 360.

1319
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,880
What do you guys think?

1320
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,880
Fact or crap?

1321
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,880
Hulu on the 360.

1322
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
I think it definitely could happen.

1323
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,880
It makes sense.

1324
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,600
I think it could happen.

1325
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,920
Going off the old standby that all rumors are, in fact, true, I could see it happening

1326
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,200
too.

1327
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,600
It's just a good alternative to Netflix.

1328
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,540
The thing I didn't like, though, is they were saying that they were going to possibly charge

1329
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,080
more money to access Hulu on the 360.

1330
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:30,360
Which, if that's the case, that's retarded, because, I mean, if you just use your PC and

1331
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:36,040
stream your PC to your 360, you can watch Hulu for free.

1332
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,960
So why should I have to pay extra money?

1333
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,800
Bochikawa in our chat says, yeah, all the consoles have internets.

1334
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,440
Why couldn't you watch them on it already?

1335
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,440
Well, I don't believe...

1336
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,440
They block it.

1337
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,240
Yeah, it's blocked on the PS3, right, and then I don't think the Wii has a high enough

1338
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,480
flash version, and the Xbox 360, don't forget, it's missing a web browser.

1339
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,680
I know, a lot of people think, just assume, oh yeah, I can surf the web on my 360.

1340
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:57,680
Actually, you can't.

1341
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,440
Well, it makes sense why they don't do that, because there's already enough holes in their

1342
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,200
security.

1343
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:10,620
And Wyland in our chat room says, if you want Dark Shadows, watch the original 1,245 episodes.

1344
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,560
Bring them to Hulu, and maybe I'll start.

1345
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,320
Although from what I understand, you don't really start watching Dark Shadows until about

1346
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:22,360
episode, like, what is it, like 75, or whenever Barnabus is finally actually first introduced.

1347
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,160
You can just kind of skip the first few.

1348
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,920
That's what I'm understanding anyway, but I could be wrong.

1349
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:35,600
All right, anyhow, so it sounds like it could be a fact we will find out in a week.

1350
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,600
Because if it's not announced at E3, then it's not coming this year, that's for sure.

1351
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,560
Dark Soccer, what you got for us?

1352
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:52,560
Well, this is more Xbox news, but basically, Robbie Bach, who is the entertainment dude,

1353
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,560
has retiring.

1354
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:58,800
There was a memo that went out that said that he is retiring.

1355
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,120
The memo was out by Steve Ballmer.

1356
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:08,080
And also, Jay Allard is going to be retiring as well.

1357
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:14,280
You gotta wonder if that means, like, retiring, like the little quotes there, like, retiring,

1358
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,320
or having their butt pushed out the door.

1359
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,200
Like, you know, there's always that kind of like, hmm, because, I mean, it's not like,

1360
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,240
I don't think Jay Allard is 65.

1361
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,480
He's not quite of that retirement age.

1362
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,800
But they've just been there for a while, and basically Xbox is printing money.

1363
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:33,920
Although, weren't they tied to a failure that Xbox had?

1364
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,560
Wasn't there something, not Xbox.

1365
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:40,600
I'd say that Microsoft was supposed to launch, was it a tablet computer or something?

1366
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,600
Something like that.

1367
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,440
Yeah, that didn't do, and I'm sure someone in chat will jump in, that didn't, I don't

1368
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,280
think ended up happening at all, and now it's everybody's iPad, iPad, iPad, so, I mean,

1369
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,440
it's just not going to happen there at Microsoft, so.

1370
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,480
I wonder how they thought they could compete with Apple over that.

1371
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,020
Some of our people in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com, guest9595, I wish you'd change their name

1372
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,640
so I could give them proper credit, but guest9595 says, hey, can't you watch Hulu and stuff

1373
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,840
with play on for any of the systems?

1374
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:19,720
That's right, that little software that lets you transfer your stuff over to the TV, right?

1375
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,920
Well, I mean, there's that, there's, I prefer diversity.

1376
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,680
I mean, you can stream Hulu, I use my PS3 to do that, and that works really well, so,

1377
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,720
I mean, it works just the same on a 360, but yeah, you can do that, and that's what I'm

1378
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,720
saying.

1379
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,720
Why should I pay the extra?

1380
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:41,720
The thing I'm guessing is it's going to be HD streaming, maybe, and you're going to get,

1381
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:47,120
you know, one of the rumors was they're going to start charging for Hulu if you want to

1382
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,320
watch some of the archive episodes.

1383
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,240
The recent episodes will be free, but the stuff past, like, you know, the first or second

1384
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,240
most recent episodes.

1385
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,360
Well, that's at the website now, isn't it?

1386
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,180
Like, you can watch the last five episodes of Glee, but if you want to watch anything

1387
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,600
older than that, you can't.

1388
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,800
Yeah, but they're going to allow you to, but you're going to have the bill to pay, so.

1389
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,680
Good thing I don't want to watch any episodes of that.

1390
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:12,040
Well, you're missing out, and that's how Sue sees it.

1391
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,960
I tried, and it made me feel a little nauseous.

1392
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,400
You and Alan should start a club, because he hates it too.

1393
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,480
All right, what else was I going to say?

1394
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,880
Oh, about the Hulu and the pay thing.

1395
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,320
I guess maybe this wouldn't really be tied together, because it's kind of, you know,

1396
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,240
Microsoft and Hulu, but remember last week, I kind of went off on this whole project $10,

1397
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,960
and I said, why the hell are we paying for Xbox Live anymore?

1398
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,080
Well, I mean, this is a feature that maybe could keep me an Xbox Live Gold member.

1399
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,080
Hmm?

1400
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,080
Maybe?

1401
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,080
Hmm?

1402
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:50,840
You know, and I'm just, and we're going to get into some project $10 stuff soon, but

1403
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:56,760
just to kind of talk about it, I'm mad at the idea of it, and the reason I'm mad at

1404
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,200
the idea is not necessarily that it affects me, but it affects a lot of other people,

1405
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:05,040
because me personally, I either buy new games, or I don't buy the games, and not necessarily

1406
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,240
that I wouldn't buy used games, but I mean, if there's a game that I don't think I'm

1407
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,280
going to be playing, I probably won't pick it up, just because I know myself, and I know

1408
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,200
that if I buy a game that I'm not so hot on, I won't end up playing it.

1409
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:28,040
It'll just be sitting, collecting dust, so for me, it's not such a big deal, but,

1410
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:32,560
you know, if you just let one thing slide, then it's just going to be a whole mess of

1411
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:39,080
crap that's going to, you know, come out later on, so that's why I'm kind of pissed off

1412
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:43,880
that EA's doing the whole project $10 thing, and then now THQ's following suit with that,

1413
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,560
and as I rumored last week, Microsoft will probably be following suit with that as well,

1414
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:53,440
and if Microsoft does it, then we'll have other people doing it, and...

1415
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:54,440
Why not?

1416
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,440
Go for it.

1417
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,440
You want to talk more project $10.

1418
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,440
Who else?

1419
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,440
Who's going in?

1420
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:04,800
Sega is considering joining some sort of online pass system.

1421
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,880
This is me scolding Sega.

1422
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Sega!

1423
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:15,360
And, you know, basically, Ubisoft is also kind of liking the idea, and Sega is saying,

1424
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:20,760
you know, it's a very clever idea, and they're certainly taking looks to see what happens

1425
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:27,240
with it, and they're saying of course, you know, that they want to be careful to make

1426
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:31,880
sure that, you know, the EA, you know, sports thing that they're doing right now actually

1427
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,760
works out, and, you know, the backlash isn't too big, but if it ends up working out for

1428
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:42,560
them, then perhaps they will allow you to, they will do something very similar.

1429
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,960
What's kind of funny, though, is, you know, we were talking about the whole online pass

1430
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:52,520
thing and the project $10 stuff with EA, and one of the theories was they wanted to kind

1431
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,600
of put this out there so that they can make some money from used sales, and also it may

1432
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:02,840
curb a little bit of the piracy because the fact that, you know, if you, at least if you're

1433
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,080
pirating the game and you want to play it online, you still have to pay them some money.

1434
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:10,960
So, you know, that might be one reason.

1435
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:20,560
But then, EA's, I guess, UK General Manager Keith Ramsdale basically made a comment and

1436
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:26,640
said, no, actually the project $10 online pass are not about that.

1437
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,320
It's all about the customer and improving their experience.

1438
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:37,440
It's simply not a defensive measure against pre-owned or piracy.

1439
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,760
I'm sorry, my bullshit meter was going off.

1440
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:47,200
I mean, if that isn't a bunch of corporate speak.

1441
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,320
Improving the customer experience, come on.

1442
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,320
That's retarded then.

1443
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:55,880
I would rather they come out and say, yeah, it's actually the curb piracy and used sales

1444
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,880
because now the fact that you're saying no, it's actually just to make your online play

1445
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,360
even better, but the online play isn't changing, then that just means no, you're actually just

1446
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,360
grabbing at money.

1447
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:11,880
At least, you know, give it the, you know, excuse that, oh, we're actually just trying

1448
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,440
to make some money off of used sales.

1449
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,240
Actually, don't even bother with the used sales.

1450
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,800
So say you're just using it to combat piracy.

1451
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,440
I mean, because everybody is like, okay, piracy, you know, that makes sense.

1452
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:29,480
But I'm sorry, I don't play a lot of EA games, at least not the sports stuff.

1453
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:35,940
So I mean, I'm guessing just looking at this stuff that, you know, Tiger Woods PGA Tour

1454
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:40,880
11 when it's coming out on Tuesday here, I'm guessing that the online play is not going

1455
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,520
to be that different from Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10.

1456
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,160
And by all means, people should really look into that, because if this is their claim

1457
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:53,000
that, oh, we're doing this to the benefit of, you know, our consumers, then you need

1458
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
to look at...

1459
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,440
I think you should write a comparison for OrangeLongTraded.com.

1460
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,640
I don't want to play Tiger Woods 10 or 11.

1461
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,840
Scour on the internet, or don't you get access to games through your job or something?

1462
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
No.

1463
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:11,960
You know, so they need to look at, you know, 10 and 11 to see, okay, was 10, the latency

1464
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:19,200
better in 11, is, you know, the options better in 11, and all this stuff, because I bet you

1465
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,640
if you look at that, it's not.

1466
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:24,680
I bet you it's the same damn shit all over again.

1467
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,040
And it really doesn't make any sense that they're charging people they're buying used

1468
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,000
for these games, because they've already gotten the money for these games.

1469
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,860
There's no reason they need more money for these games.

1470
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:39,240
You're not adding more users to the online, because this is still one copy of a game that's

1471
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,600
floating around out there.

1472
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,640
You've already made your money.

1473
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:47,520
So if you can't run your, you know, infrastructure on the money that you've made, you know, on

1474
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,760
new games, it just doesn't make any sense, because what if, which is, it's not going

1475
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:58,680
to happen, but what if, you know, say, you know, this whole online passing ends up flopping,

1476
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,920
and you're not making any money for, you know, the online games.

1477
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,440
People aren't paying to play online more than that seven-day trial.

1478
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,760
Well then nothing changes.

1479
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,760
Then nothing changes.

1480
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,680
Because that's not going to motivate them to get rid of it, because they're still going

1481
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,200
to make money off new games.

1482
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,200
Exactly.

1483
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:20,880
And if you think about it though, you know, what are they hoping to accomplish by this?

1484
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,840
They're hoping that people either buy the game new, or they're going to basically, you

1485
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:31,240
know, hope that they pay the ten dollars or whatever, five dollars, to actually play online.

1486
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:36,000
But if people don't pay that, and they don't receive enough revenue, then guess what?

1487
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,240
The online experience doesn't change at all.

1488
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:46,320
So basically making their whole point, you know, you know, nonsense.

1489
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,920
Because if they're not making money from this extra use sales, and using it to improve their

1490
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,560
service, then they're full of shit.

1491
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,560
Alright.

1492
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,360
Uh, let's move on with another story, because this is like three weeks in a row we've talked

1493
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,000
about this stupid thing now.

1494
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's because it's dumb.

1495
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,600
I know, I know, I know, and it's something new is coming up every week, and sadly we're

1496
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,560
probably going to hear even more about it at E3, and what other companies are going

1497
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:14,040
to jump on board, yippie yippie.

1498
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:19,000
Speaking of things that are full of bullshit, somebody has filed a lawsuit against Sony

1499
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,760
and Square Enix, because Final Fantasy 13 caused severe and widespread damage to PlayStation

1500
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,320
3 consoles.

1501
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,680
It was filed by Daniel Wolf, it's a class action lawsuit, meaning if he wins you'll

1502
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,080
all get a piece of this.

1503
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:42,040
But Wolf reckons that it freezes, and PlayStation 3s, and when you play this you can get your

1504
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:47,720
PS3 console to become totally and permanently inoperable.

1505
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,600
The lawsuit says both defendants are eminently aware of the damage being caused by their

1506
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,360
defective products, and have chosen to do nothing about it.

1507
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:02,040
They're being sued, I guess, for over 5 million in damages, and relief is being sought.

1508
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,600
Meaning that, you know, if you are affected by you having both of these things, you could

1509
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,400
get your very own coupon for $5 in the mail, that'll probably be the piece of this that

1510
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,620
you're entitled to.

1511
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,800
That's usually what happens with these class action lawsuits.

1512
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:14,800
Whatever.

1513
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,800
I mean...

1514
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,800
It doesn't make any sense, because it's not widespread.

1515
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:25,220
Was Xbox, I know, did Xbox ever have to settle for the Red Rings of Death thing?

1516
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,280
Because in my opinion, that was a much bigger problem.

1517
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:33,920
I think that's why they extended the warranty to three years, I thought.

1518
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
But I could be wrong.

1519
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,120
But it doesn't matter, because this isn't widespread.

1520
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,360
Where are your data on this?

1521
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,360
Where is the data?

1522
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,360
Seriously, because...

1523
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,840
Rob, you own Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3.

1524
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,000
Is your PS3 inoperable because of Final Fantasy XIII?

1525
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,720
No, but there was that one day, like what, March 1st or whatever, when all the clocks

1526
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,780
were fucked up, remember that?

1527
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:02,840
But that wouldn't be because of Final Fantasy XIII since it came out after that.

1528
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,720
So I mean, I don't know.

1529
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:11,120
I would think that that would be hard to prove in the first place.

1530
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:18,020
That there is widespread damage, because it's like a dude, saying, oh, my system crashed.

1531
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:23,520
By the way, just randomly asking this question, how many of you remember the one day the PS3s

1532
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,520
were down?

1533
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,080
I bet most of you forgot.

1534
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,400
And that was only about three months ago.

1535
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,400
Just saying.

1536
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,400
There was that, remember that one day?

1537
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,400
Yeah, I remember that one day.

1538
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,780
Yes, yeah, it was one day.

1539
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,240
Three months ago, going retro here on a lot.

1540
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,480
In case you forgot, too, Activision was being total dicks to Infinity Ward as well.

1541
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,060
Just refreshing that.

1542
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,160
We should do that every week.

1543
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,880
We should have like, hey, you know, in case you forgot.

1544
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,480
Never, we'll have a segment called Never Forget.

1545
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:52,520
Never Forget.

1546
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,520
Never Forget.

1547
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,040
Remember that time that Namco's really pissed off at us?

1548
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,040
Never Forget.

1549
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,760
I like it, man.

1550
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,160
We're full of ideas this month.

1551
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,160
I like that.

1552
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,320
I think that should be a segment that we do regularly.

1553
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,320
For Forget.

1554
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,320
Never Forget.

1555
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,320
Never.

1556
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,680
It should be Never Forget.

1557
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:13,680
Never Forget.

1558
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,680
Never Forget.

1559
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,680
Oh, no, we should do that on the website.

1560
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:17,680
There you go.

1561
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,320
Oh, that is a wonderful idea for a series of articles.

1562
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,440
I don't, is there an OLR fan that maybe wants to pick that up?

1563
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:29,680
But we need to do actually more stuff that's like, you know, a lot older than just the

1564
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,680
Infinity Ward thing.

1565
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,680
Because that's pretty recent.

1566
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,520
Well, I bet some people are forgetting about it, though, already.

1567
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,520
I understand that.

1568
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:36,520
I mean, out of sight, out of mind.

1569
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,920
When that stuff stops getting reported in the media, people are like, oh, yeah, I was

1570
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,400
really mad about that.

1571
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:42,400
Like, that happened.

1572
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,520
I was listening to an old OLR randomly the other day, I don't know why, and it was not

1573
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,520
that old.

1574
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,520
Like, a couple months ago.

1575
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:55,680
And I was talking about how the, remember when Xbox, Never Forget.

1576
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,940
When Xbox Live used to discriminate against the word gay being in your profile.

1577
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:01,720
But they did get rid of that.

1578
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:05,200
But I remember when I, I think we were reporting it here on the show.

1579
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,560
And I was like, oh, yeah, I was really mad about that when that first happened.

1580
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,160
But I kind of forgot that that had happened.

1581
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:18,720
So we do need a Never Forget, so that, like, things that I get mad about, and you get mad

1582
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:21,300
about, and Jamie gets mad about, we never forget.

1583
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,800
Maybe it could be like a page on the wiki.

1584
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:28,600
And when one of us says, Never Forget this, somebody can add it to the wiki, so that way

1585
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,160
we never forget.

1586
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,720
Ah, yes.

1587
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,720
I like that idea.

1588
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,560
People are crazy.

1589
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,360
Whatever.

1590
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,360
You know it's a good idea.

1591
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
It's a dark circle.

1592
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,480
Surely there's something in your mind.

1593
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,200
You're like, you know what, never forget that this happened.

1594
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,280
Never forget that people are bitches.

1595
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,360
Well that's just a given.

1596
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,760
That has nothing to do with gaming.

1597
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,760
It's alright.

1598
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,080
Okay, never forget the crystalline entity is a bitch.

1599
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,080
There you go.

1600
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,720
Now you're, now you're on the right track.

1601
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,640
Never forget Half-Life 2 Episode 3 still isn't out yet.

1602
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,160
But maybe, maybe that's why the Portal 2 thing was canceled, because they're gonna show Half-Life.

1603
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,560
Here's the thing, I think the Portal 2 thing is still happening, but I think that they're

1604
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,640
under, you know, they're all, yeah, the event was canceled, but you know, then there's gonna

1605
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,720
be like, oh haha, Aperture Science has trapped you all, and now you must run through this

1606
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,720
maze.

1607
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,800
Let Jamie get her thought out, and then I've got an idea on that.

1608
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,320
Well, from what I was reading, though, Half-Life 3 is gonna have, actually, Shell from Portal

1609
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:38,040
is supposed to be making her appearance, and then they also are talking about the, um,

1610
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:41,800
what's the name of that ship that Aperture put out, that's supposed to show up?

1611
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,160
Oh, it's a cameo at the end of Portal, isn't it?

1612
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,160
I think?

1613
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:56,040
No, they, they mention it in that retooled portal, but um, but like, it's some ship that,

1614
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:00,200
of Aperture's that crashed or something, but anyway, I don't remember the whole deal.

1615
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:05,280
Okay, here's what I was supposed to say about the Portal 2 party, um, is that, I bet what

1616
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,120
they're doing, like, did you hear that really fucked up story, never forget this, by the

1617
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:13,360
way, did you hear that really fucked up story about that school in, like, Mississippi or

1618
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:17,240
whatever, where the, the girl wanted to go to the prom with her girlfriend, but they

1619
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,120
were like, no, cause you're a dirty lesbian, and we're not gonna have that happen in our

1620
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,200
prom, da da da, and what they did, you know what they ended up doing?

1621
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:30,360
They threw another prom, and invited, like, her and her girlfriend and like, eight school

1622
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:35,280
misfits to, like, the fake prom, and they had, like, a real prom somewhere else.

1623
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,280
Yeah, that was crap.

1624
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,040
That was fucked up beyond belief, right?

1625
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,800
What if that's what they're doing with the Portal 2 party?

1626
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,840
They're like, sorry guys, the Portal 2 party got cancelled.

1627
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,000
I seriously think- But then suddenly we'll see these reports

1628
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
on the internet about, oh, oh, oh, well 1UP.com got invited to this, uh, this super secret

1629
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
party.

1630
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,400
No, I seriously think that they're gonna actually have, it's gonna be this, you know, oh, it's

1631
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,840
actually a secret surprise, and then, you know, the surprise is, oh, look at this, you

1632
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:08,840
know, the, you know, GLaDOS has, uh, hacked the conference or something, you know, something

1633
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,040
ridiculous like that.

1634
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,480
Salacious Pop saves the day, Dark Sakura.

1635
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,000
The Borealis is the ship.

1636
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
That was it.

1637
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
There you go.

1638
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,920
I knew it had some sort of celestial name.

1639
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:25,440
No, that's, like, the Aurora Borealis.

1640
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,160
And Bobby's reminding us that he was supposed to go to the Portal 2 party and he's a misfit

1641
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,160
now.

1642
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:34,760
So, sorry, Bobby Black Wolf, but, uh, it very well could be that you have something in common

1643
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,760
with a lesbian in Mississippi.

1644
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,760
Off to the island with you.

1645
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,440
I'll throw you your improv.

1646
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,640
That's okay, Bobby.

1647
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:43,740
I didn't get invited to anything, so we can have drinks.

1648
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:44,740
I take that back.

1649
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:47,200
I, I, I do have an appointment to see Rock Band 3.

1650
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,200
Whoo!

1651
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:49,200
What?

1652
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,200
So, there's that.

1653
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,200
Remember, steal a keytar.

1654
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,200
Okay.

1655
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,200
Lord.

1656
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,640
Then you'll really be reading about that on the blog, the blogs.

1657
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,800
All right, look, let's move on, uh, Dark Sakura.

1658
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,840
We need, we need a dose of, like, something really cool and awesome in this show.

1659
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,840
How about some class?

1660
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:06,840
All right.

1661
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:07,840
We need, this show could use a little class.

1662
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,560
Actually, this show could use a lot of class.

1663
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,640
More class than a class action lawsuit.

1664
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:18,280
Anyway, first, I must preface this by saying that it is about the recently knighted Sir

1665
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,280
Patrick Stewart.

1666
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,240
Whoo!

1667
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,240
That makes me happy.

1668
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,240
About damn time.

1669
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,440
So, now, you must address him as Sir Patrick Stewart.

1670
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,440
Sir Patrick Stewart.

1671
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:28,440
Patrick Stewart.

1672
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:35,800
At, at, at any rate, um, he's basically on record saying that he loves his beautiful

1673
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:41,640
iPhone, that it has become an extension of himself, that he couldn't imagine going without

1674
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:45,480
it or his laptop, but that he has a stack of video games.

1675
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:49,200
I want to hear Patrick Stewart narrate a story about how much he loves his iPhone.

1676
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,400
There's a video on this one, too.

1677
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,400
Really?

1678
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,400
Talking about it.

1679
01:19:53,400 --> 01:20:02,440
Um, but, um, he's saying that, um, he has, um, in fact, I'll read the quote, the only

1680
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:07,320
aspect of all this that I've never taken to in part because I have an addictive temperament

1681
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,320
is gaming.

1682
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,240
I have a stack of games that I've never taken the covers off of because I feel that if I

1683
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,960
do I'm finished.

1684
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,840
Can I just listen to a little bit of Patrick Stewart?

1685
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,840
Yes.

1686
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:18,840
Can I, can I just listen to his voice?

1687
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,840
Okay, first of all, Rob.

1688
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,840
What?

1689
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:21,840
Did you see him in Jeffrey?

1690
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,840
Yeah.

1691
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,840
Years ago.

1692
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,840
God, I love it.

1693
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:26,840
I love him in that movie.

1694
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:27,840
Shh.

1695
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,840
Shh.

1696
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,840
Shh.

1697
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,840
Shh.

1698
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:31,840
Shh.

1699
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,840
Everybody worship.

1700
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,840
Seems to me to be a little bit simplistic.

1701
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,280
Maybe I like complexity and, uh, abstraction too much.

1702
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:47,000
Um, but on the other hand, I just handed someone my beautiful iPhone, which I never have out

1703
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,960
of my hand and that I do everything with and has become an extension of who I am.

1704
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,520
I travel with my laptop everywhere.

1705
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,360
Emails are absolutely sexual in my life.

1706
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,360
His voice.

1707
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,360
It sounds like he said sexual in my life.

1708
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,360
He did say sexual.

1709
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,360
Didn't he?

1710
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,920
He could just read the phone book to me.

1711
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:07,920
Sorry.

1712
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,560
That was, and that was really quiet over the feed.

1713
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:10,560
I apologize guys.

1714
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,560
I don't know why it's so quiet.

1715
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,560
Oh, beautiful.

1716
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,560
I know, right?

1717
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,560
Sorry.

1718
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,560
Patrick Stewart.

1719
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,560
Sorry.

1720
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,560
Tiger, sir.

1721
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,560
Patrick Stewart.

1722
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,560
Sir Patrick Stewart.

1723
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,560
Sir.

1724
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:23,560
Patrick Stewart.

1725
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,560
Sir.

1726
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,560
So haha.

1727
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,560
All you people who don't like Apple.

1728
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,560
Haha.

1729
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:28,560
All right.

1730
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,560
Patrick.

1731
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,560
Sir.

1732
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,560
Patrick Stewart endorses it.

1733
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,560
Haha.

1734
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,560
It's just cause he hasn't touched a droid, right?

1735
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,560
Loki.

1736
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,080
Not since the days of Star Trek, the next generation has he ever touched a droid.

1737
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,080
Uh, Loki.

1738
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,480
How about some release dates?

1739
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,560
Release dates traveling around the globe, talking about what's coming out in a neighborhood

1740
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,560
near you.

1741
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:47,560
Yes.

1742
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,920
Um, this week, yeah, not a lot.

1743
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,760
There's just some weird stuff and, uh, some decent stuff.

1744
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,320
So let's start with the weird stuff.

1745
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,320
America's next top model on DS and the Wii.

1746
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,320
Sorry.

1747
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,320
Wait a minute.

1748
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,320
I thought that was supposed to come out like two weeks ago cause I remember cracking a-

1749
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,320
I'm sorry.

1750
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,000
As soon as Loki said that I had to yawn really bad.

1751
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Hey, listen.

1752
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,080
I remember cracking a Tyra Banks is crazy joke.

1753
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:16,760
I understand that and she is crazy, but you know, it'll come out when it's ready to come

1754
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,760
out.

1755
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,760
Just like Tyra.

1756
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,760
Uh, Call of Duty, the war collection, uh, making its way out on Xbox 360.

1757
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,760
Yes.

1758
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:25,760
It's a bunch of rereleases.

1759
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
Um, let's see.

1760
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,960
I wonder if the top model game will have a panty party in it.

1761
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,480
If you've never seen this YouTube, you need to YouTube, Google this on YouTube or whatever,

1762
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,480
YouTube it.

1763
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:41,240
Um, Tyra Banks panty party.

1764
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,680
It's the funniest thing I've ever seen on the Tyra Banks show.

1765
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:50,440
She goes, we're going to have a panty party.

1766
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,520
Sorry random piggy.

1767
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,480
I've been, I've been a woman most of my life.

1768
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,160
I was a girl before that.

1769
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:01,360
I've never had a panty party.

1770
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,000
You haven't lived.

1771
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,880
How about a manty party?

1772
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,600
No thank you.

1773
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:12,480
Uh, let's play ballerina on the DS.

1774
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,760

1775
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:21,760
Uh, green day rock band coming out on Wii, PlayStation three and Xbox 360.

01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,800
Um, it's included in the price this time and it's still $10 more, but you get some free

1779
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,800

1780
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,800
So that's cool.

1781
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,800

Maybe that's the new instrument in a rock band three, your balls.

1791
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,560
You can do harmonies with your balls.

1792
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:32,880
Clearly it's nothing but David Bowie songs, if that's the case.

1793
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:39,760
Satisfashion rock the runway on DS and I think that's also on the Wii as well.

01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:19,840
Do you have the time to listen to me whine about a bunch of release dates for, uh, Japan?

1801
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:25,040
Uh, stuff that's coming out in Japan this week on the Xbox 360 grand theft auto episodes

01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,400
Yeah, but it's not being released until next year and that makes me sad.

1809
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:46,200
Although seeing how far that they went with, um, the red faction in the new red faction

1810
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,800
Armageddon game, or I think it's Armageddon is the subtitle on that.

1811
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,800
It looks awesome.

1812
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:55,300
And if that looks awesome, saints row three is going to be that much more awesome.

1813
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,880
It's going to be more awesomer and that should be what's on the title.

1814
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:03,280
More awesomer than saints row two, uh, PlayStation three gets the same stuff.

1815
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,280
That's right.

1816
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,800
Grand theft auto episodes from Liberty city, just cause two and saints row two, all the

1817
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:13,960
same stuff on the PS three over in Japan this week, Nintendo, we gets karaoke joy sound.

1818
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,760
We Enka that comes with a USB microphone, Enka game.

1819
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:19,960
That's what it says.

1820
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,720
That's coming from Hudson.

1821
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:22,720
Do you know what Enka is?

1822
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:26,480
Um, it's like the Japanese version of folk country music.

1823
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,480
Oh yes.

1824
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,480
I have heard some of that.

1825
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,480
Remember me playing you Jero?

1826
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,480
Yes.

1827
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:32,480
I remember that.

1828
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,480
Oh boy.

1829
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,480
Yeah.

1830
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,600
It looks like, I don't know if it's like a super popular version of their karaoke revolution

1831
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,600
or what, but that is coming out over there.

1832
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,600
That's super popular though.

1833
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,840
I'm not surprised, I'm actually surprised it took this one to get an Enka game out.

1834
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:48,360
Well, there's also a duets game coming out if you want to check that out too.

1835
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:51,680
So a dark Sakura might be importing the Wii Enka.

1836
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,680
I don't know.

1837
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,680
A Zeno blade.

1838
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,680
I don't know any Enka songs.

1839
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,680
Also comes out this week.

1840
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,600
Well, you can learn some, but Zeno blade, this is kind of a big deal.

1841
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,260
You guys, Zeno blade is coming out on the Wii in Japan this week.

1842
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,260
So there you go.

1843
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,840
That's, that's going to be a pretty big title out there.

1844
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,440
RPG of course.

1845
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,520
Coming over to the handhelds for a minute and checking out what's coming out on the

1846
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:15,520
Nintendo DS this week.

1847
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,160
On the Nintendo DS this week, you have Rockman Zero Collection.

1848
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:20,240
That's a pretty big deal.

1849
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:26,280
As well as Marugokaku Shikaku Dasu Gaishiyoshi Seiken comes out this week.

1850
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,000
Boy, that's a mouthful.

1851
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,120
What is this game all about?

1852
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,120
I don't know.

1853
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,120
That's what she said.

1854
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,960
Because there's nothing on the cover that I can understand except a little picture.

1855
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,240
It looks like navigation software could be.

1856
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,000
So that's probably going to be completely useless to you here in the US and I just wasted

1857
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,520
30 seconds of your time.

1858
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,960
So let's move to the PSP and talk about what is coming out on the PSP this week over in

1859
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,320
Japan.

1860
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:54,320
Wand of Fortune Portable is the big release on the PSP this week.

1861
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,360
Wand of Fortune Portable from Idea Factory, an adventure game.

1862
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:03,280
I don't see any screenshots, but the characters look like anime Harry Potter people, so I'm

1863
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,320
sure that'll be fun.

1864
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,160
Never forget Zelda, Wand of Gamelon.

1865
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,520
Oh god, was that the 3DO game?

1866
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,520
Yes.

1867
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,520
One of them.

1868
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,520
Oh, cry.

1869
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,400
I played that at a classic gaming expo a couple years ago.

1870
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,800
It was terrible.

1871
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,120
Good times.

1872
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,440
Alright, Dark Sakura.

1873
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,960
How about the old country?

1874
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,160
Well, really not a whole lot.

1875
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,760
On the 8th is Green Day Rock Band.

1876
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:32,760
Yay.

1877
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,960
9th is Joe Danger.

1878
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:42,080
And then toward the end of the week, on the 11th, we have King Arthur, Mega Man Zero Collection,

1879
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:47,200
Naval Assault the Killing Tide, and Super Mario Galaxy 2.

1880
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,200
The end.

1881
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,800
It's over!

1882
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,200
By the way, surprise that no one in studio had anything to say on Super Mario Galaxy

1883
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:54,200
2.

1884
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:57,080
My Wii is still not hooked up, that's why I haven't bought the game yet, but I am hearing

1885
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:59,800
phenomenal things about the game.

1886
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,800
So have I.

1887
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,800
I just kinda...

1888
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,120
I know, it's kind of under the radar right now.

1889
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,600
It's kinda one of those games I hope I can go back to and play at some point, but for

1890
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,000
right now it's kind of on the back burner.

1891
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,080
But yeah, I've heard lots and lots of good things about Mario Galaxy 2.

1892
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,560
Apparently outshines the first.

1893
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,520
Well, that'll be impressive.

1894
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,760
Yeah, the first was not a bad game at all.

1895
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,160
Perhaps Nintendo can send me a free copy once I pimp out my room in New Super Mario Bros.

1896
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,160
Eh?

1897
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:24,160
Eh?

1898
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,160
You should try it.

1899
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,160
You never know.

1900
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,160
You know, future gamer.

1901
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:28,160
No.

1902
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,520
Teaching them young.

1903
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,000
I'm telling you, when you do that to your kid, your kid's gonna rebel.

1904
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,240
You're gonna have a kid that wants to go out and play football all day?

1905
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,280
I don't care if he wants to go play football, that's fine with me.

1906
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:44,000
I'm not forcing him to like video games, that's just the theme we're doing his room in.

1907
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Alright, fair enough.

1908
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
He can do whatever he wants.

1909
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,160
If he wants to go work on cars and play football and that kind of stuff, that's fine with me.

1910
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,960
He won't though.

1911
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:59,800
My mom was a painter, and so she painted my room all in Sesame Street characters.

1912
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:06,760
See, I guess it could work that way, because my parents gave me a baseball mitt and football

1913
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:13,880
and stuff like that, but my dad, on the other hand, he bought a ColecoVision for himself

1914
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,380
and Atari games and stuff, and then I just naturally started playing those, they bought

1915
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:20,160
me a Texas Instruments computer.

1916
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,600
That's right, because you were born in like 81, right?

1917
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,600
When all that was out?

1918
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,600
I was 80.

1919
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,600
80?

1920
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,600
Okay, 80.

1921
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:31,080
When all that stuff came out, and just naturally I got into it, and the stuff that I was into

1922
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:38,240
like when I was that old, you know, I'm into now even more so.

1923
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,240
I don't know.

1924
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,320
I'm not going to force it upon them, I'm not going to like, you have to play games, because

1925
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:47,040
my wife hates games, which is ironic that she suggested that we do a Mario Brothers

1926
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,040
themed room.

1927
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,360
I never would have thought that.

1928
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,360
I know.

1929
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:51,360
I'm surprised.

1930
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,520
Well, your wife does have those random moments of gaming.

1931
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,760
Like you know, she loves Bejeweled, right?

1932
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,380
And there's other stuff she's played too, right?

1933
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:02,520
She said that we couldn't do the pixelated Mario on the wall.

1934
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,840
She didn't want the old school Mario, because she wanted it cutesy and bright and colorful

1935
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:10,720
and I guess Mario, you know, New Super Mario Brothers, you know, those stuff, because we

1936
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,800
were originally just going to do just the decals on the wall, but the problem is those

1937
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:22,520
decals that you buy for like $70 a sheet, which is really ridiculous, they only have

1938
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:28,640
so much ground, it's like four feet worth of the ground vinyl, and we just can't circle

1939
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,960
the room with that stuff, so we have to paint everything.

1940
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,800
I mean, I'm not going to spend, you know, money to buy enough sheets to cover the whole

1941
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,800
room.

1942
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:36,800
It'd be ridiculous.

1943
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,160
Why are all the guests leaving the funny comments tonight?

1944
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:44,000
Guest 5872, please change your name, folks, when you get in there, type slash Nick, and

1945
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,240
then the new name, and I can credit you if I really...

1946
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,480
Or you get booted.

1947
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:53,560
Tsukibon Satu-rena, you should do this room in President Cat.

1948
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,960
Clearly it's a listener of the show.

1949
01:31:54,960 --> 01:32:01,560
We almost did it in Stella theme, Stella would be my cat, so, but that would be weird.

1950
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,560
Kitty theme.

1951
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:06,280
She is a little bitch.

1952
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:13,300
She wants me to play, because we made her a toy out of bag handles, these little like

1953
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:18,660
string handles or whatever, and we tied them together, and now she'll go like drag this

1954
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:23,560
thing around me, and if I don't play with her, then she starts biting me, so she's a

1955
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,560
little bitch sometimes.

1956
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,560
But I love her.

1957
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,560
She locked her in a room with Shermie.

1958
01:32:27,560 --> 01:32:28,560
Alright.

1959
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,560
We gotta move on, guys.

1960
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,560
She wins.

1961
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,160
We're an hour and a half into part A, and we're not even done yet.

1962
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,200
But we haven't talked about my cat enough yet.

1963
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,480
I'm sorry, I really want a cat, y'all.

1964
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:41,240
I'm getting to that point, I think it's time for me to be a daddy.

1965
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:42,640
Like Rob needs to be a daddy.

1966
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,640
What?

1967
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,640
You're in luck.

1968
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,640
Because I have a cat for you.

1969
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,320
No, I don't want your cat.

1970
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,320
No, not my cat.

1971
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,320
Screw that.

1972
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,320
My cat.

1973
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,320
My cat.

1974
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,720
I'm talking about Barney, the female cat outside.

1975
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:59,520
That is, she's still a wild cat, but she, and yeah, I don't know why we call her Barney,

1976
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,880
but we, that's the name we gave her before we found out that she was a girl, and so it

1977
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:04,880
just stuck.

1978
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:10,680
But she actually is very friendly and comes up to us and stuff, so I will trap her for

1979
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,680
you if you want.

1980
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:15,760
I'm not, oh great, I brought you a kitty in a box.

1981
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,120
Adopt a cat, Rob.

1982
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:20,560
Yeah, I'm not gonna do it just yet, like I think I need to move.

1983
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,120
They're so easy to take care of though.

1984
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:25,340
I know, but remember, I'm gone every weekend, you guys.

1985
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:26,340
Every weekend I'm gone.

1986
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,120
So I'll go take care of your cat on the weekends.

1987
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,120
You won't.

1988
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,120
Yes I will.

1989
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,120
It's too far.

1990
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:33,200
No, I go take care of Susan's cat when she goes out of town.

1991
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:34,200
Really?

1992
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,200
We'll see, we'll see, guys.

1993
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:38,800
Rob, I would take care of your pussy.

1994
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,400
Would you pet my pussy when it needed it?

1995
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,400
Yes I would.

1996
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,400
Thank you.

1997
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,400
And give it a bath.

1998
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,920
Hi, I'd wash your meat.

1999
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,960
Would you wash my pussy on the weekend?

2000
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,720
Well, I got a schedule.

2001
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:55,760
Never forget how mature we are here at Orange Laundry Radio.

2002
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,960
Alright, a couple quick stories for you, classic game of the week coming up.

2003
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,880
Loki, what do you got for us?

2004
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:06,040
Yes, so we were talking a little bit about Project $10 and how EA likes to find ways

2005
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,160
to milk you for your precious money.

2006
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:13,720
Well, now they're doing it again, and this isn't something that you necessarily have

2007
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:17,280
to do, but it's something you may be tempted to do.

2008
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:26,200
Madden 11 basically logs everything that you do online, your play calling, what tendencies

2009
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,880
you do, and that kind of stuff, and it builds kind of a playbook.

2010
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,440
Wait, wait, wait, you can't see your porn collection, can it?

2011
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,440
No.

2012
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,640
It can't see your porn collection.

2013
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:41,960
And it basically builds like a playbook that kind of revolves around what you do.

2014
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:49,040
And now, if you play, I guess, enough people or whatever, other people can get that from

2015
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:58,480
you, but you can actually purchase these reports as well so that you can kind of get the dirt

2016
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:02,800
on the other players that you're playing against.

2017
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,680
And that's kind of strange, like I don't really have another word for that.

2018
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:08,680
That's just...

2019
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,680
I don't know.

2020
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:13,720
Well, yeah, you of course sell it, take all that information and then sell it.

2021
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,560
It's kind of shady, but...

2022
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:20,320
It's kind of like them selling the cheats that were in the games, you know, cheats that

2023
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:25,760
used to be just button presses, now you have to pay $2 to unlock and type stuff.

2024
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:27,900
It's just...

2025
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,760
It's such a desperate money grab.

2026
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:35,480
I mean, seriously, you're becoming that desperate chick, EA.

2027
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,280
Nobody likes a desperate chick.

2028
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,000
Anything they can do, right?

2029
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,080
Any place they can just get more money?

2030
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,000
Stop being so obvious with it, though.

2031
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,080
I mean, it wouldn't be such a big deal if you put out Madden for $30 and then did all

2032
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:49,080
this stuff.

2033
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:52,660
Because at least that way, if you don't want to participate in it, you're getting a really

2034
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:53,660
good deal.

2035
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:57,320
If you do want to participate in all this crap, then you may be spending a little bit

2036
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,720
more than you would normally.

2037
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,720
I don't know.

2038
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,360
I mean, it's just...

2039
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:05,280
There's no real benefit if you don't do it, I guess.

2040
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,560
You know what I mean?

2041
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:11,080
If you're going to charge me for online for used or whatever, then the real game...

2042
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,080
I don't know.

2043
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,600
But I guess since you're...

2044
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,280
If you buy it, you knew it really doesn't affect you anyways.

2045
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,840
But seriously, though, don't let it slide.

2046
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,840
Never forget.

2047
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,600
Alright, this is going to make you even more angry, you guys.

2048
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:30,880
Apparently there is a draft, and it's not a law yet, this is just a draft that the Federal

2049
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:36,160
Trade Commission here in the U.S. making this draft, they're making some proposals to Washington,

2050
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:42,040
and apparently one of them is a 5% tax on consumer electronics.

2051
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:46,600
Now some folks are calling this the iPad tax, but it's not just iPads, you guys.

2052
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:49,000
It really should be just iPads, though.

2053
01:36:49,000 --> 01:37:00,160
iPads, iMacs, Zunes, DSs, 360s, laptops, digital cameras, I mean, basically Best Buy is fucked.

2054
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:03,480
A lot of things you buy there are going to have a 5% tax on it.

2055
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,040
They're just going to pass it on to the consumer.

2056
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,800
But why are they doing this, folks?

2057
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,800
Why?

2058
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,960
Because it will generate $4 billion for the U.S. government, which it could then use to

2059
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:19,280
subsidize failing media outlets like newspapers.

2060
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,280
What?

2061
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:24,680
Okay, instead of using that $4 billion to, I don't know, put a dent in the national debt,

2062
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,400
let's blow it on more stupid shit.

2063
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:30,000
Or hire back teachers that they had to fire this year, I mean, I realize that was more

2064
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,120
of a state thing than a federal thing, but I mean, I can think of more better uses for

2065
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,120
this.

2066
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:38,680
I mean, wasn't there just a story, not that long ago, I remember reading it, maybe it

2067
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:45,360
wasn't on this show, but about how the iPad is reinvigorating the old school media because

2068
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,280
like a lot of these newspapers are coming out with editions for the iPad that they're

2069
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,240
selling subscriptions to, and they're actually doing quite well.

2070
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:56,800
And magazines are doing this too, like the iPad is becoming this new reading device.

2071
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:04,720
It's kind of like, why do we need to save your archaic ass if you're not going to evolve?

2072
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:05,720
It just doesn't make sense.

2073
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:11,840
You know, again, it hasn't passed yet, but it's a dumb idea.

2074
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,840
I just don't like what they're using the money for.

2075
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,720
I think the money could go to the more, you know, important things.

2076
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,880
Why do we have to bail out the news media?

2077
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:25,160
I mean, they sell ads, they eat, they need to evolve and adopt to where their readers

2078
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,160
are.

2079
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,160
Can I get some of that money?

2080
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:35,640
We're media, we're floundering, we haven't made a dime since this show began.

2081
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,040
I want four billion dollars, wah.

2082
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,360
It's just, it's stupid.

2083
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,040
Stop bailing out companies.

2084
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,040
Seriously.

2085
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:49,100
Alright, well let's move on to a part of the show that needs no bailing out.

2086
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:53,300
It's very popular here on The Orange Laundrao, and every week you guys come to know and love

2087
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:54,300
this segment.

2088
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,440
It is the classic game of the week.

2089
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,440
Rob?

2090
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:59,440
Yes.

2091
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:04,360
I think that everyone's going to figure out what this game is when you play the opening.

2092
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,960
Alright so then I, well let me just say though, every week, for those that maybe have never

2093
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:11,280
listened to Orange Laundrao's radio before, every week Dark Soccer likes to go through

2094
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:16,700
the vault, the classic video game vault, and pick out a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful

2095
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:21,320
little bastards playing on the lawn, you need to go play this classic video game immediately.

2096
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,320
Get off my lawn and play this game.

2097
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,320
Exactly.

2098
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:28,140
Maybe that's what we should rename this segment, get off my lawn and play this game.

2099
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:41,600
Here is tonight's classic game of the week.

2100
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,240
Now if you don't get what that is from that, you need to seriously crawl out from under

2101
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:51,320
the rock you've been living under, and this is mostly dialogue, but yeah the game is Metal

2102
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:55,520
Gear Solid.

2103
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,640
And who said Barbie, whatever, anyway.

2104
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:08,720
Metal Gear Solid, a stealth action game that was directed and written by the guy I used

2105
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:12,760
to run into every year at E3, Hideo Kojima.

2106
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:21,840
It first came out in 1998 for the Playstation, and it's actually the sequel to the MSX2,

2107
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:28,160
Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake, not the one we got over here, the actual MSX version.

2108
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,800
Wait, what in the actual hell is this video?

2109
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,640
It's actually 3 hours and 20 minutes long, like people can do this on YouTube now?

2110
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,880
That's the playthrough of the first half of the game.

2111
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,120
I thought you were limited to 10 minutes.

2112
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,120
In theory.

2113
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,120
What?

2114
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:47,160
I love the voice acting in this, and by the way, the guy who did Snake's voice was David

2115
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:52,720
Hader and he also wrote the first two X-Men movies, which is why they were good.

2116
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:59,840
And the third one, Blue, he had written the third one, it would have been good.

2117
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:07,000
So this is the one that brought Metal Gear up to the current generation of gamers.

2118
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:16,360
Basically he's going in and stopping a group called Foxhound, which was his old unit, has

2119
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:27,080
to liberate some hostages and basically stop them from, well, blowing up the earth, I guess.

2120
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,080
Creating...

2121
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,720
Man, I hate it when people try to blow up the earth.

2122
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,760
Let's play Thermonuclear War.

2123
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:42,120
So yeah, it has amazing voice acting, and even with the limitations of the visuals back

2124
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:49,080
in the day, they really did a good job in covering up the things that would have been

2125
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:54,080
harder to show, like blurring the face a little bit, smoothing a line here or there.

2126
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,160
It really did look very good for its day.

2127
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:03,480
You could get all kinds of bonus stuff to use in the game, because it's on-site weapons

2128
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:08,200
procurement is how it's played, like the old ones.

2129
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:14,320
You can also get infrared goggles and a cardboard box, and he smuggles his cigarettes in through

2130
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,320
his stomach.

2131
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:19,320
Does that mean that he barfs up his cigarettes as soon as he lands?

2132
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,320
Perhaps.

2133
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:21,320
I don't know.

2134
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:22,320
Yeah.

2135
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,680
Actually, you have to use the cigarettes to get through a couple of stages too.

2136
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:27,320
I think that's funny.

2137
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:33,120
There are, as you can tell from listening to all the speaking in the background, lots

2138
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:39,160
of cut scenes and conversations, the game is very dialogue-heavy.

2139
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:44,880
But on the plus side, it's very good voice acting, why don't you turn it up a little

2140
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:45,880
bit?

2141
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:48,520
Unfortunately, it's a little bit quiet, but here you go.

2142
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:52,080
Oh, that's when he's about to land, so...

2143
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,560
There's no voice acting, right?

2144
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:59,180
There's some in a second, because we're at the part where he breaks through the water,

2145
01:42:59,180 --> 01:43:03,240
and that's the start menu of the game.

2146
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:07,160
Well, what we can do when we get school.

2147
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,160
I love the music of this game.

2148
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,160
I actually have the soundtrack.

2149
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:12,520
I have the soundtrack to all the Metal Gear Solid games.

2150
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:16,760
And I also pick up all the art books for Dan every year.

2151
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:24,400
At any rate, the whole first part of the game is to teach you the whole stealth part of

2152
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,260
the game, and once you get the stealth down, you can actually go through the whole game

2153
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:31,360
for the most part without killing people.

2154
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:35,920
You get bonuses, I think, for the fewer that you kill.

2155
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:42,560
But you also have to sort of maintain a working knowledge of how the entire facility is laid

2156
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:47,240
out as you go through it, because you have to run back through it part of the way.

2157
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:50,600
The characters that you have in this one is...

2158
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,560
I think this is funny.

2159
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,440
The character designer said that Solid Snake's physique was based off Jean-Claude Van Damme,

2160
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:01,840
but his face was based off of Christopher Walken.

2161
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:02,840
I don't see that.

2162
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:08,200
I think he's a little bit better looking than Christopher Walken.

2163
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:14,640
So you've got Roy Campbell, who is his former CEO, and then you have Master Miller, and

2164
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:21,280
Mei Ling, and Naomi Hunter, and Natasha Romanenko, who is a weapons person.

2165
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:27,560
But you also get Otacon, later on, who is named after the convention.

2166
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,560
Here's some voice acting.

2167
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,600
The elevator in the back is the only way up.

2168
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,600
Just as I expected.

2169
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:36,440
You'll have to take the elevator to the surface, but make sure nobody sees you.

2170
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:39,440
If you need to, contact me by codec.

2171
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:43,560
The frequency is 140.85.

2172
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,440
When you want to use the codec, push the select button.

2173
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:49,680
When we need to contact you, the codec will be...

2174
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,680
There you go.

2175
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,800
That's the other thing I was going to bring up.

2176
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,440
This game totally breaks the fourth wall all the time.

2177
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:05,960
First of all, when you run into one of the other hostages, he tells you about a soldier

2178
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:11,160
that Snake ran into earlier, who ends up being Meryl, said, yeah, you can contact her on

2179
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:12,160
codec.

2180
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:13,160
Oh, I remember.

2181
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:16,000
Her number is on the back of the CD case.

2182
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,440
Nice.

2183
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:24,840
And then when you fight Psycho Mantis, who is this telepathic telekinetic type of dude,

2184
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:30,240
he proves his psychic powers for you by telling you to put your controller on the floor, and

2185
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:35,120
then making the vibrate function go off to make it move.

2186
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:40,760
And then he reads your memory card, and at the time he was reading games that Konami

2187
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:43,480
hadn't put out yet.

2188
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:50,440
So if you've got Xenogears later, it says, I see you like Xenogears.

2189
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:54,400
I think I even had a Japanese game on there and it recognized it.

2190
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,920
Go Fig.

2191
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,600
So yeah, but I mean, this is like the major Konami games at the time.

2192
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:06,760
But anyway, you go through the game and you've got this ninja that follows you around.

2193
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:14,400
And he's Gray Fox, which I think he was in the second Metal Gear game, the MSX one.

2194
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,300
So yeah, you go through the game, you get to see Metal Gear Rex, and oh yeah, you also

2195
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:26,240
have an informant called Deep Throat, which I thought was a kind of neat nod towards,

2196
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:29,880
well, you know, that there was an actual Deep Throat.

2197
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:30,880
Towards the one in the Lovelace?

2198
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,880
Oh, oh, sorry.

2199
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,880
No.

2200
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,880
The actual, yeah, no, I know.

2201
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:34,880
Of course, I know.

2202
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,880
Finally.

2203
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:36,880
Oh, yeah.

2204
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:37,880
That's right.

2205
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:38,880
Like right before he died, right?

2206
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:39,880
Yeah.

2207
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:40,880
Yeah.

2208
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:41,880
You know, I think he was declassified at the time.

2209
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:42,880
Mm hmm.

2210
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:47,920
So, um, man, that, that's something else though, being able to hold a secret that long, you

2211
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:48,920
know?

2212
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:56,440
Um, anyway, um, you go through the game, you have an epic battle with, uh, um, Liquid Snake,

2213
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:01,320
who is the, uh, antagonist and, uh, Solid Snake's twin.

2214
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:06,760
And you also have two endings based on what you do during the torture sequence.

2215
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:09,680
One of them, Meryl, gets to live.

2216
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:12,280
The other one, Meryl, dies.

2217
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:13,280
Aw.

2218
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,680
And there's my favorite question in the whole game.

2219
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:22,280
Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on the battlefield?

2220
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:25,880
Why does love always feel like a battlefield?

2221
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:26,880
Battlefield.

2222
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,880
Battlefield.

2223
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:35,920
Also, um, for tie-ins, and I know I've brought up police knots before, um, uh, Meryl was

2224
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:47,820
a character in, um, police knots, so she was included, um, and then, um, there's, uh, references

2225
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:51,240
to, uh, Metal Gear in police knots.

2226
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:57,080
And actually, I think scenes from police knots that go through when, um, Otacon is talking

2227
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:05,200
about being a big geek, basically, he's a big Otaco, um, he pees himself too.

2228
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:10,080
The first time you meet him, seriously, he backs into a corner and pisses himself.

2229
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,080
Hello LP joke.

2230
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:14,080
I know, right.

2231
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:21,200
Um, and there's also, um, preliminary, um, artwork that was an easter egg for police

2232
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:25,320
knots, um, pilot disc for the 3DO, which I think didn't come out, actually.

2233
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:29,760
Um, so yeah, there are, there were, um, some side stories.

2234
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:38,120
There was, um, Metal Gear Solid Integral, um, which, um, is based off of the expanded

2235
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:45,200
Japanese version, except, um, it had, um, a VR mode with it.

2236
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:50,320
We got the VR missions as a separate disc, um, but it had, like, a PS, uh, you remember

2237
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,280
the, um, pocket station, Rob?

2238
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,280
I do.

2239
01:48:54,280 --> 01:49:01,880
It had a pocket station minigame, um, you could, uh, uh, call the codec frequency and

2240
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:06,680
get commentary from the staff, and you had a first person, first person, first person

2241
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:07,680
mode.

2242
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:13,440
And then after, and then there was also, um, Metal Gear Solid the Twin Snakes, which came

2243
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,880
out on GameCube.

2244
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:22,600
And also one that people may not be familiar with, the Bleem version, for Bleemcast, which

2245
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:27,200
basically, it ran it through with the Dreamcast superior rendering capabilities, and it was

2246
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:28,200
really nice.

2247
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,200
I've got it.

2248
01:49:29,200 --> 01:49:35,920
It, I mean, I, I, I totally suggest everyone look up, um, Bleem for Dreamcast, Metal Gear

2249
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:39,560
Solid, and then compare them side by side, it really is my thing.

2250
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:50,200
Um, the soundtrack was amazing, it was done by, um, Rika Muranaka, and, um, uh, well actually,

2251
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:57,760
the ending song was done by her, and it's, um, also sung in Irish, um, for the, uh, for

2252
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,760
the ending.

2253
01:49:58,760 --> 01:49:59,760
I thought it was funny.

2254
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:00,760
I'm gay like I should say.

2255
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:06,240
Um, so yeah, from there we got all kinds of others, we got digital comics, we got a graphic

2256
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:11,200
novel, and then, um, of course, there were all of the sequels.

2257
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:19,640
Metal Gear Solid 2 The Avengers of Raiden Running Around Naked, um, did you ever play

2258
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:21,720
that one?

2259
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:22,720
Which one?

2260
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,720
The second one?

2261
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:25,600
Um, a very little, very, very little.

2262
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:32,640
It was Metal Gear, it was, uh, Sons of Liberty, where Snake is in there calling himself Iroquois

2263
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,640
Pliskin.

2264
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:34,640
Mm-hmm.

2265
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:38,760
You know, Pliskin also from Snake, Pliskin, yeah.

2266
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:43,960
And then Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, where he is actually playing as Naked Snake, who

2267
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:45,760
turns out to be Big Boss.

2268
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,760
Spoiler!

2269
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:49,120
Ooh, where have you been?

2270
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:53,800
And then, uh, Metal Gear Solid 4, uh, Guns of the Patriots.

2271
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:58,480
And then, of course, there's Metal Gear Solid Rising, uh, coming out, which is supposed

2272
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:02,920
to, I think, feature Raiden, who is running around naked boy.

2273
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,360
Good times?

2274
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,640
I love her.

2275
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:07,640
In the game.

2276
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:08,640
What's wrong?

2277
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:09,640
Nothing.

2278
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:17,400
I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so... cute.

2279
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:18,800
You're just flattering me.

2280
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,800
No, I'm serious.

2281
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:23,600
Well, I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.

2282
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:24,600
Come on.

2283
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:28,080
I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake.

2284
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,480
But, uh, I'm surprised.

2285
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:31,480
Yeah.

2286
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:37,960
Anyway, um, if you keep talking to her, she'll give you, like, a little parable or a little

2287
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,480
phrase, you know what I mean?

2288
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,320
She's basically your fortune cookie throughout the game.

2289
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:45,880
But if you keep calling her, she'll eventually just get mad at you, and her answer will be

2290
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:49,720
dot, dot, dot, and she'll have this big frowny face.

2291
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:52,320
And then, um, there's another...

2292
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,800
I think it was in, um, the second one?

2293
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:59,480
Or was it in the first one where you're in the locker, and if you look at the picture

2294
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:04,240
of, like, the girl that he... and then call someone on the codec, it sounds like he's

2295
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:05,240
jerking off.

2296
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,240
Yeah.

2297
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:07,240
Okay.

2298
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,240
Yeah.

2299
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,280
There's Easter eggs in this game.

2300
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:14,280
It was like, Otacon tells him, we don't have time for that, Snake.

2301
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:15,920
That was the second one.

2302
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:18,600
He's like, we don't have time for that, Snake.

2303
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,720
And he's just got the O face.

2304
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:21,720
It's funny.

2305
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:22,720
So, yeah.

2306
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,720
Ew.

2307
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,520
I think I know a little bit too much about the Metal Gear games.

2308
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:26,520
You sure do.

2309
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:27,520
Alright, but that's alright.

2310
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,520
So, is that it for the wrap-up?

2311
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,520
That's it.

2312
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,520
Alright.

2313
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,520
We gotta move on with the show.

2314
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,520
Yeah, we do.

2315
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,320
But that was a good... that was an epic Game of the Week there.

2316
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,320
Epic.

2317
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,920
I'm already losing my voice again.

2318
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:42,720
Metal Gear Solid is your classic Game of the Week, and a true classic at that.

2319
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,720
Yes.

2320
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,640
So, we're gonna take a quick break so that we can rest our voices and all that fun stuff.

2321
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:47,640
We will be back.

2322
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,640
We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to go.

2323
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,440
It's gonna be a long episode tonight, you guys.

2324
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:54,160
We're gonna talk about a new game from the creator of Parappa the Rappa.

2325
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:55,880
Possible upgrades of old PS2 titles.

2326
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,360
Goldeneye could be making a comeback.

2327
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:00,420
We're gonna talk all about that in Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

2328
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,420
Don't go anywhere, folks.

2329
01:53:01,420 --> 01:53:10,200
We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

2330
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,360
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening.

2331
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:19,280
June the 6th of 2010, where we are doing episode number 369 of our show.

2332
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:20,280
69.

2333
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:22,120
E3's just around the corner.

2334
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:25,800
Of course, we've had a lot of news and rumors and stuff about what's coming up at E3.

2335
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,000
Also, I think our show is taping live tonight while the MTV Movie Awards are going on, I

2336
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,700
think is the big thing tonight.

2337
01:53:32,700 --> 01:53:35,240
And as to who's winning right now, I don't care.

2338
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,920
I mean, are those awards relevant?

2339
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:37,920
Do they actually mean anything?

2340
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,600
Or is it just an excuse to get a bunch of celebrities together for ratings?

2341
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,600
Uh...

2342
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:44,600
Yeah.

2343
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:45,600
Yeah.

2344
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:46,600
That's pretty much how I feel, too.

2345
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,960
All right, so let's get back into some gaming news, then.

2346
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,920
Some things we care about around here, and some rapid, quick stories for you guys here

2347
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:58,480
before we get back to some Twitter topics, which we're gonna get to in a moment, at twitter.com

2348
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,480
slash O-L-R.

2349
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:02,320
So you probably got, like, three minutes to get in your topics if you haven't yet.

2350
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,720
In the meantime, let's do some rapid-fire news.

2351
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:11,200
Well, the first of hopefully many pieces of download content for Reddit Redemption will

2352
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:12,200
be coming out soon.

2353
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:20,000
On June 22nd, Outlaws to the End will be adding some new content to the game.

2354
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:25,120
Six online co-op missions for two to four players.

2355
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:33,480
And also, they're gonna have some different, I don't know, different types of missions

2356
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:34,480
in there.

2357
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:38,600
Looks like one where you're escorting a raft, which is kinda cool.

2358
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:42,400
And that'd be great, because I don't know about people that have played Reddit Redemption,

2359
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:47,040
but the gang hideouts that you can actually play during free mode, I think we've gone

2360
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:49,360
through all of those at least six times now.

2361
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:54,640
It's getting old fast, and we need some more things to play.

2362
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:57,760
So that would be awesome.

2363
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:04,080
And of course, that is gonna be free on the 22nd.

2364
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:08,760
Wii Party is gonna be one of the games that are gonna be showing off this year at Nintendo's

2365
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,760
press conference.

2366
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:20,440
And it's gonna feature 80-plus games, including some interesting ones, remote control hide-and-seek.

2367
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:21,440
That's kinda cool.

2368
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:26,360
I guess the players will hide their Wii remote somewhere in the room, and the other players

2369
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:31,240
have to search for it by the sound coming from the controller's speaker.

2370
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:33,160
Wow.

2371
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,440
Groundbreaking and revolutionary.

2372
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:37,200
I will give them props for being somewhat unique.

2373
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:40,880
Some of the other games they were talking about called Wanwan Karuta.

2374
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:47,160
Wouldn't it be funny if, like, you hid the thing too good, and then it's too far away

2375
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,440
from the Wii to make a noise or whatever, so it gets lost forever?

2376
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:51,440
That would be funny.

2377
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,680
Sucker, gotta buy another $40 controller.

2378
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:59,520
Wanwan Karuta is a game where the Wii remote will make a sound, and the players will have

2379
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,960
to match the noise with an on-screen image, for example, an animal.

2380
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:09,480
They also have a game called Sensitive Bomb, which players will pass a single remote to

2381
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:14,080
one another without trying to jostle it too much to trigger the explosion.

2382
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:21,000
So what you do is you pass that to another player, and then you push them.

2383
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,900
That's playing with power.

2384
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:30,440
And that'll be, of course, shown at the press conference on June 15th.

2385
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:31,440
Some other fun stuff.

2386
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:35,200
Will Reggie Fils-Aime come out and try to blow somebody up and push them and all that

2387
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,200
stuff, you think?

2388
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:42,300
He won't, because he's probably endorsing family play that's not destructive like that.

2389
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:45,000
I don't give a shit.

2390
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,880
There are no rules in Wii parking.

2391
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:54,920
Connex is apparently teaming up with Nintendo to make some Mario Kart toys, and this is

2392
01:56:54,920 --> 01:57:01,000
supposed to be happening sometime in 2011, but that is awesome that you can make toys

2393
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:06,820
based on Mario Kart and Connex, because, you know what, hey, if it's not Lego, it's Connex,

2394
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:11,440
so that would be fun.

2395
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:18,040
I would love to have Lego or Connex toys based on the Mario stuff.

2396
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:23,360
So Salacious Pop is keeping us updated in chat on the MTV Movie Awards.

2397
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,960
Here's why you're glad you're not watching.

2398
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,200
You ready for this?

2399
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:30,560
Best Female Performance, Kristen Stewart in Twilight, New Moon.

2400
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,120
Best Male Performance, Robert Pattinson in Twilight, New Moon.

2401
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:39,480
We're clearly not the demographic for- Best Movie, The Twilight Saga, New Moon.

2402
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:42,960
We are not the demographic for MTV anymore.

2403
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:46,120
You have to understand.

2404
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:49,380
The MTV we knew and loved is gone.

2405
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,380
It's dead.

2406
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:51,920
You know what Twilight needs?

2407
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:52,920
Simon Belmont.

2408
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,720
That's what Twilight needs.

2409
01:57:54,720 --> 01:58:00,400
Hey, going on to some quick fire news and some other stuff that's coming out.

2410
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,620
Rock Band Weekly updates.

2411
01:58:02,620 --> 01:58:04,000
Deftones are coming out.

2412
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Whoop-de-doo.

2413
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,960
Grown up in Sacramento, I've heard way too much Deftones.

2414
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:11,320
Cherry Waves, Hole in the Earth, and Minerva, whoopee whoopee.

2415
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:15,640
Individual songs, Boys Like Girls with a Great Escape, and Crown of Thorns with Rock Ready.

2416
01:58:15,640 --> 01:58:18,800
I will be buying none of those songs.

2417
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:19,800
But maybe you're interested.

2418
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,680
I too will be buying none of those songs.

2419
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:25,340
Here's a game that might actually catch my interest.

2420
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:26,580
Maybe I will buy this.

2421
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:29,360
It's a game called Hardcore Uprising.

2422
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:32,320
Hard Corps, but I think the P is silent when you say it like that.

2423
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:36,840
Hardcore Uprising for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.

2424
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,040
Why am I interested in this game?

2425
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,520
Apparently it's a spiritual successor to Contra.

2426
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,820
It plays like Contra.

2427
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:44,080
It feels like Contra.

2428
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,080
It's high def.

2429
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:46,080
It's a side scroller.

2430
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,080
It's guns.

2431
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,760
It just doesn't have Contra in it.

2432
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:56,200
But the game looks awesome because it's, you know, done by Axes, I think, or not Axes.

2433
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:01,080
The people that did it are like BlazBlue, because it's all hand drawn stuff and looks

2434
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:02,080
awesome.

2435
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:05,440
Well, you might remember there was a Genesis game called Contra Hard Corps.

2436
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:09,400
This is apparently a successor to that game, but for whatever reason, they've just decided

2437
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:10,400
not to call it Contra.

2438
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:14,500
I guess they just didn't want people to know what this game was.

2439
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:15,500
So whatever.

2440
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:18,240
It still looks cool.

2441
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:19,240
There it is.

2442
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:20,600
Uh, who is it?

2443
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,600
Uh, let's see.

2444
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,440
Yeah, Arc System Works apparently is doing this game.

2445
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,440
Yes, Arc System Works.

2446
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:25,440
That's what I was thinking.

2447
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,440
There it is.

2448
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,840
So it will be beautifully animated.

2449
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,840
That's for sure.

2450
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:36,360
Alright, also coming out, Earthworm Jim HD.

2451
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:38,800
Apparently that is the big release next week.

2452
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,680
Also some deals.

2453
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:42,320
Worms 2 is getting a price reduction.

2454
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:44,520
Kegel goes down to 400 points.

2455
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,320
Duke Nukem 3D is down to 400 points.

2456
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,400
I might have to finally pick that up.

2457
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:52,080
So yeah, lots of good deals on Xbox Live next week, and of course, Earthworm Jim, or as

2458
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:54,080
the intro says, Earthworm Jim.

2459
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,240
You know, a little burping thing.

2460
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:58,200
Uh, HD comes out on this Wednesday, June the 9th.

2461
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:00,200
And that's going to be awesome, because you can play four-person co-op.

2462
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:01,720
Yeah, four-person co-op.

2463
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:02,720
That's right.

2464
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,160
That'll be fun.

2465
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:05,160
So there it is.

2466
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:10,160
A couple of little stories about things coming out very soon on the downloadable platforms.

2467
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:11,160
Dark Sakura.

2468
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:18,440
In other news, Sony Online Entertainment is actually releasing some information about

2469
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:24,160
PlayStation 3 and PC MMO for DC Universe Online.

2470
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:27,440
But they really haven't said too much more about it.

2471
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:31,480
There's no real release date, but they said that both versions will come out at the same

2472
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:32,860
time.

2473
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:35,920
It's likely to be in November.

2474
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:41,320
Which actually is what they finally came out and said.

2475
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:43,400
So that's cool, I guess.

2476
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:47,720
I don't know how it'll play, but hey.

2477
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:56,680
Also the voice actor, Phil Snyder, who we better know as the voice of Jiminy Cricket,

2478
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:03,240
said that he's working on an unannounced project called Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

2479
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:17,040
And said that that's likely a sequel to the mobile phone game, Kingdom Hearts Coded.

2480
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:22,120
Could be a redrawn, you know, an upscaled version or ported too.

2481
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:23,120
Could be.

2482
02:01:23,120 --> 02:01:26,080
You know, when you're going from mobile phone to PSP, you expect things are gonna be upgraded

2483
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,640
quite a bit.

2484
02:01:27,640 --> 02:01:29,880
Not really.

2485
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,120
I would hope so.

2486
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:33,120
Could be an iPhone title.

2487
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:34,440
Oh, that could be too.

2488
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:36,680
I don't know how I feel about that.

2489
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:48,360
And then we've had some more Sims titles, well, domains actually being registered by

2490
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:51,440
corporate domains.

2491
02:01:51,440 --> 02:02:04,720
There are the Sims Medivial, or the Sims Get Medivial, so could possibly be old school

2492
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:12,160
jousting Sims with chamber pots and chastity belts and tight lacing and lights.

2493
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:16,960
What if they have it where you can design your castles and stuff like that?

2494
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:21,520
Well, not that you can't design castles and add moats, cause hell, I was doing that in

2495
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,520
Sims 1.

2496
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,520
Well, the moats part.

2497
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:28,920
And they've actually got out a Ren Faire set officially through the Sims store.

2498
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:35,400
And then Mod The Sims, which is one of the mod sites I go through, they actually did

2499
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:38,000
a Medivial challenge.

2500
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,880
You know what piece of equipment they could put in a Sims Medivial game that would make

2501
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:41,880
me buy it?

2502
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:42,880
A guillotine.

2503
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:43,880
With his head!

2504
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:50,040
Yes, and then I could literally sit in the throne, or I'm sorry, my Sim could sit in

2505
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:51,040
the throne in the house.

2506
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:52,040
Off with his head!

2507
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:54,240
And then you also need an Iron Maiden.

2508
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:55,240
Yes.

2509
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,240
Iron Maiden!

2510
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:57,240
Excellent!

2511
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:58,240
Execute them!

2512
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,240
Bogus!

2513
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:00,240
Wow.

2514
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:05,240
Yes, I've seen that movie.

2515
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:06,240
1987 called.

2516
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:07,240
A lot.

2517
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,240
It misses you.

2518
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:12,240
Hey, I got it right.

2519
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:14,320
Alright, never forget.

2520
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:16,240
I am the Duke of Ted.

2521
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17,240
Never forget.

2522
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:20,000
Dark Sakura is a frickin' nerd.

2523
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:21,000
So?

2524
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Nerd.

2525
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,360
That's why we love you, you nerd.

2526
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:25,360
So?

2527
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:28,320
Alright, so you're just a nerdy nerd.

2528
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:29,320
That's all.

2529
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:35,600
Alright, we're gonna get into a segment here on the show we like to call the Twitter Topics.

2530
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:37,560
But I'm missing the theme music for Twitter Topics.

2531
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:39,320
Can we do Twitter Topics with no theme music?

2532
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:40,320
Can we?

2533
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:41,320
I don't know.

2534
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:42,320
Doo doo doo doo doo.

2535
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:43,320
I don't know.

2536
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:44,320
Do we have, like, music?

2537
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,320
Are you gonna sing the theme music?

2538
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:46,320
No, I'm not.

2539
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:47,320
Alright.

2540
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,320
Well, you're saved anyway.

2541
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,320
I found it.

2542
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,320
See?

2543
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:53,160
It's what we call stretching for time while I look for stuff for Twitter Topics.

2544
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:55,520
Not a lot of tweets tonight.

2545
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,320
I'm frowning with disappointment at our listeners.

2546
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,320
Here's my frown to all of you.

2547
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:03,320
Alright.

2548
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:06,760
Let's see.

2549
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:08,680
Lots of plugs for articles on the website.

2550
02:04:08,680 --> 02:04:10,320
See, I got those in earlier.

2551
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:13,480
Dr. Noir sent his condolences to the Golden Girl-loving crew.

2552
02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:16,680
Yeah, I guess we didn't really talk about this enough earlier in the show, but there

2553
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:18,640
was a lot of celebrity death, obviously.

2554
02:04:18,640 --> 02:04:21,680
I don't buy the whole death comes in threes things.

2555
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:24,760
I think people just look for coincidences wherever they want to.

2556
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:27,480
Um, cause didn't, like, Art Link let her die, too?

2557
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,040
And nobody cares about him, though.

2558
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:30,040
So, whatever.

2559
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:31,040
Who?

2560
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:32,040
Well, I'm saying, you know.

2561
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:33,040
And Gary Coleman.

2562
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:34,040
Right.

2563
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:35,040
Who technically does have a video game tie-in.

2564
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,040
He was in Portal 2.

2565
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:39,040
Or, Portal 2.

2566
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,480
Postal 2.

2567
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,720
Much different.

2568
02:04:41,720 --> 02:04:43,320
He still could be in Portal 2.

2569
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:48,600
Or, importantly, he's in Avenue Q. And, um, uh...

2570
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:49,600
Rue McClanahan, of course.

2571
02:04:49,600 --> 02:04:50,600
No, no, no, no.

2572
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:51,600
The man.

2573
02:04:51,600 --> 02:04:52,600
Our zombie man.

2574
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:53,600
Dennis Hopper.

2575
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,600
Yeah.

2576
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:59,600
I put on my Facebook that Dennis Hopper was going to come back as a zombie riding a motorcycle

2577
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,600
cause, what, wasn't he an easy rider, or?

2578
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:02,600
Yeah, he was.

2579
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:03,600
He rode it, or something, didn't he?

2580
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:04,600
Yeah.

2581
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:05,600
Well, that's what I mean.

2582
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:08,600
That was his big movie and all the Romero flicks.

2583
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:14,040
But, um, my, I think my uncle added on there that Gary Coleman would be in the sidecar.

2584
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:16,640
Alright, um, Tigerclaw sends us a link.

2585
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:19,520
He sent us a lot of links, but some of them we're actually tackling a little later in

2586
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:20,520
the show.

2587
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:21,520
But I will use this one.

2588
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:25,400
I think somebody had pulled this up and wanted us to use this to see if you, maybe, I think

2589
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:28,240
you showed this to me earlier, Dark Soccer, but I'll go ahead and read it now.

2590
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:33,520
Cause, um, Tigerclaw sent it in, but this is, this is straight up fucked up, you guys.

2591
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,920
This is straight up fucked up.

2592
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:42,640
Um, Predator used Call of Duty to coerce kids into sending nude pics.

2593
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:46,360
I don't know how appropriate the stupid newborn music came on.

2594
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:47,360
Here we go.

2595
02:05:47,360 --> 02:05:53,320
Um, a New Jersey man convinced four 13 and 14 year olds to send him pictures of their

2596
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:58,320
genitals by saying that it was a membership condition of the clan he was starting in Call

2597
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,160
of Duty World of War.

2598
02:06:00,160 --> 02:06:04,800
Jonathan Prime is 20 years old and faces four felony counts of communication with a minor

2599
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,920
for immoral purposes.

2600
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:12,120
He also has a previous conviction on a child porn charge related to this case in his home

2601
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:14,680
state.

2602
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:19,320
He's in jail on a $25,000 bond and all this stuff.

2603
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:25,600
Just, kids, don't send pictures of your penis over Xbox Live ever.

2604
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:30,320
And don't, he shouldn't really send pictures of your penis like anywhere.

2605
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:32,360
And let me tell you why.

2606
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:38,480
It gets bigger until, when do you stop growing like 23 or something?

2607
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:44,080
I mean, just wait, wait until you're fully mature.

2608
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:45,280
And it's gross.

2609
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,280
Come on.

2610
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:47,280
That's the real reason.

2611
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,760
You don't do that.

2612
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:52,000
Don't send pictures of your dongle over the internet.

2613
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,560
All right.

2614
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:55,200
Um, let's see.

2615
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:58,920
Meow Frog sent us some tweets saying, first time listening to OLR live.

2616
02:06:58,920 --> 02:06:59,920
Well, welcome.

2617
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,840
And ah, what's the chat for OLR?

2618
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:07,480
Well, I saw Meow Frog in chat earlier, so I know they made it to chat, but it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com

2619
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:11,640
for anyone else who is listening and wanting to know how to join us in our chat room.

2620
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:17,080
Um, although if you ask in the All Games chat, um, they'll probably tell you how to get over

2621
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:18,080
there too.

2622
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:19,080
All right.

2623
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:20,080
Um, let's see.

2624
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:24,000
Uh, what else do we have?

2625
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
That's about it.

2626
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:30,400
Except Jay Jugo, and I hope I'm saying this right, Jay Jugo, uh, I hope it's not Hugo.

2627
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:34,440
Jay Jugo says, uh, the never forget segment should be added to the show.

2628
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:35,440
Never forget.

2629
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:39,440
I'm just not sure how to make that like a piece of the show.

2630
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:40,440
So I don't know.

2631
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:45,200
Uh, Loomis sends us a tweet saying, OLR, will you be going to BlizzCon, Sky?

2632
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,720
I would love to buy you a drink.

2633
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:47,720
No homo.

2634
02:07:47,720 --> 02:07:51,200
Oh, I forgot about that saying.

2635
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:52,200
Thank you.

2636
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:56,640
Uh, well sadly, uh, homo or no homo, I'm not going to BlizzCon because I didn't know what

2637
02:07:56,640 --> 02:08:00,560
was justified, $150 for the tickets.

2638
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:05,080
Um, so I didn't buy the tickets because I didn't know what I'd be paying for, except

2639
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:07,960
that probably there's sneak peeks in new BlizzCon games.

2640
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:12,760
However, Dark Soccer and I are, we're thinking about just going down to Anaheim anyway, if

2641
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:14,280
finances will allow.

2642
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:16,960
We'll go down to Anaheim anyway and just go to Disneyland.

2643
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,840
It'll be called, uh, USCon.

2644
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:20,840
Yes.

2645
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:23,080
So you can buy us a drink there, I suppose.

2646
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:25,080
No homo.

2647
02:08:25,080 --> 02:08:32,080
By, by the way, Rob, I had to, I had to describe to somebody what the difference between girly

2648
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:33,080
and gay was.

2649
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,080
Oh my gosh.

2650
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:35,080
And decorating.

2651
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:40,960
I, I don't, I, I just cannot even possibly understand.

2652
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,460
All right.

2653
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:43,460
That's it.

2654
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:44,460
That's it for tweets.

2655
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:45,460
We didn't get a lot of tweets tonight.

2656
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:47,760
Well we got, I mean, Tiger class has other stories, there are things that are coming

2657
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:54,320
up later, so you know, we appreciate his Google foo, but I don't want to spoil upcoming stories.

2658
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:56,440
All right.

2659
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:59,240
How about some other topics we want to talk about tonight?

2660
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:00,240
Loki.

2661
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:01,240
Yes.

2662
02:09:01,240 --> 02:09:05,640
Let's talk about how Parappa the Rapper, um, well, the creator of Parappa the Rapper is

2663
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:09,640
putting out a new music game for the iPhone and iPod.

2664
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:12,440
Um, it looks interesting, I guess.

2665
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:19,900
It's called, uh, it looks like Winta or War is Not the Answer.

2666
02:09:19,900 --> 02:09:23,040
And it's, um,

2667
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,560
What is it good for?

2668
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,600
What is it good for?

2669
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:27,600
Butter.

2670
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:28,600
Uh, yeah.

2671
02:09:28,600 --> 02:09:39,080
They didn't really say, uh, what exactly the game, um, is going to be like, but it's basically

2672
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:42,540
tapping squares on the screen to time with music.

2673
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:48,360
So kind of looks a little bit like it could be, um, you know, similar to like Lead Beat

2674
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,520
Agents or something like that.

2675
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,520
Well I mean, Coolin' All.

2676
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,480
Is the art done by Mr. Greenblatt?

2677
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:53,480
It's just squares.

2678
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:54,480
Yeah.

2679
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:55,480
The art could have been done by anybody.

2680
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:56,480
Here's the thing.

2681
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:59,640
I get all excited when I hear it's the Parappa the Rapper dude, and then I'm like, oh, it's

2682
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:03,220
just like neon squares that I push with my finger.

2683
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,220
This sounds riveting.

2684
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:09,920
I mean, I guess if the music's cool, then it's worth checking out, but come on.

2685
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:14,360
How about a new like actual like Parappa or Umjama Lamy type game?

2686
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:18,960
I mean, tell me that like Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, I suppose more appropriately, would

2687
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:21,800
not be like the perfect platform for a game like that.

2688
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:22,800
Come on.

2689
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,800
Yeah.

2690
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:24,800
It'd be cool.

2691
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:25,800
It'd be awesome.

2692
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:26,800
You got to believe.

2693
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,800
Never going to happen.

2694
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:33,680
By the way, the butter, you know, that comes from cheap, cheap, cheap level.

2695
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:39,120
We used to just for months, Dan and I would go around going crack, crack, butter.

2696
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:41,960
So he laughed in the other room.

2697
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:44,280
I feel happy.

2698
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:48,620
And Derek H took my question literally saying a war saved us from the Nazis and war freed

2699
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:49,620
the slaves.

2700
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:52,760
I was singing a song, I don't forget it.

2701
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:53,760
It's all right.

2702
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:58,480
All right, moving on.

2703
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:04,640
Could Sony possibly be possibly be planning more PS2 remakes?

2704
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:08,160
For example, you know, they did the God of War remakes earlier.

2705
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,560
Well, guess what?

2706
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:11,560
It's a survey going around again.

2707
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,560
Yep.

2708
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:13,560
That's right.

2709
02:11:13,560 --> 02:11:15,200
The surveys sometimes leak things that Sony are thinking.

2710
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:16,200
Survey says.

2711
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:20,720
Oh, you didn't see that joke coming.

2712
02:11:20,720 --> 02:11:21,720
One of the things on the survey.

2713
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:25,760
Well, the survey said, what titles would you like to see in a future collection?

2714
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:31,440
Two or more PS2 titles upgraded with similar features to God of War collection.

2715
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:35,120
And I like this because there's this little screen shot that shows like Shadow of the

2716
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:41,760
Colossus, Ico, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, Yakuza, Silent Hill, like just every single

2717
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,300
freaking franchise is being listed in there.

2718
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:48,160
But I guess it's kind of cool that they're going back and thinking about doing that.

2719
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:49,160
But you know what?

2720
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:51,720
Show me Twisted Metal.

2721
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:53,280
You know, Metal Gear.

2722
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:57,360
You know, what's interesting about this, though, is that they're asking about what do you want

2723
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:02,480
to see upgraded and not just like what backwards compatibility would you like to have on your

2724
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,200
PS3?

2725
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:08,320
You know, I realize, yes, there's that first generation of consoles that does have it,

2726
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:12,080
but most of us don't have a better console and we all figured that they would end up

2727
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:13,520
selling it at some point.

2728
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:18,120
But I don't know, like I feel like there's there's something missing here.

2729
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:22,640
Yes, I'm one of those douchebags that has the fully backwards compatible system and

2730
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:24,800
doesn't play any PlayStation 2 games on it.

2731
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:25,800
Douchebag.

2732
02:12:25,800 --> 02:12:30,200
You want to trade PS3s because I could sort of play like Final Fantasy 12.

2733
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:31,840
No.

2734
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:34,960
Did you ever upgrade your PS3 to lose the other OS feature?

2735
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:35,960
Nope.

2736
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:36,960
You're still holding out, huh?

2737
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:37,960
Still holding out.

2738
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:43,040
Haven't played 3D Dot Game Heroes 2 because that would upgrade my system.

2739
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,320
So I'm loading it to a friend.

2740
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:49,760
ToaGak in our chat room says, very eloquently, fuck PS2 remakes.

2741
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,720
I mean, are they necessary?

2742
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:54,080
I mean, maybe he's posing a good question there.

2743
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:55,080
Is this really necessary?

2744
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:56,080
No.

2745
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:57,900
Well, the God of War collection was pretty cool, though.

2746
02:12:57,900 --> 02:13:02,020
I mean, HD, widescreen, sexy.

2747
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:03,020
Come on.

2748
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:04,020
It was kind of cool.

2749
02:13:04,020 --> 02:13:05,020
Right?

2750
02:13:05,020 --> 02:13:10,520
It'd be kind of cool if the system did that on its own, but it kind of doesn't.

2751
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:15,080
Derek H. says, if they redo Gran Turismo 2, people will realize it has more cars and tracks

2752
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:18,000
than GT5.

2753
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Might be a good point.

2754
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,280
Maybe they don't want us to go back and play some of those old games.

2755
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:24,040
I don't know.

2756
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:27,320
DarkTet Suvia thinks you should be a game show host, by the way.

2757
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:28,320
Me?

2758
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:29,320
Yeah.

2759
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:30,320
Why?

2760
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:31,320
I don't know.

2761
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:32,320
Maybe he liked your survey says.

2762
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:33,320
Survey says?

2763
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:34,320
Survey says.

2764
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,320
You should do a game show about porn.

2765
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:37,520
I could see you doing that.

2766
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,320
Wheel of porn.

2767
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,320
Remember way back in the day?

2768
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:42,840
Let me give you an OLR flashback.

2769
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:43,840
Never forget.

2770
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:46,120
This is many, many, many, many, many years ago in the OLR history.

2771
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:48,440
It was probably in the first or second year of OLR.

2772
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:49,440
Never forget.

2773
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:57,440
Loki hosted a competition, and the competition was called Make Edit Get Porn.

2774
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:00,240
I got second place in that, didn't I?

2775
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:01,240
I don't remember as long as I'm good.

2776
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:02,240
I placed in it.

2777
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,240
I know I did.

2778
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:04,560
I think you and I both placed.

2779
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:09,400
But this was where basically you would make an edit to a DDR song, because back in the

2780
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:13,040
day you could make edits in the home version of DDR and put them in the machines.

2781
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:17,080
And Loki's favorite edits would receive a free gift of pornography.

2782
02:14:17,080 --> 02:14:18,280
We did the hell edits.

2783
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:19,280
That's right.

2784
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:20,960
And it was called Make Edit Get Porn.

2785
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:22,720
It was the best contest the stations ever had.

2786
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:25,320
I did the DXY version called Another.

2787
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:33,800
I think I did one to kick the can called Big Cans.

2788
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:35,240
I think that was it.

2789
02:14:35,240 --> 02:14:37,640
And then there was the one with the big gap in the middle that you could run around all

2790
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:40,360
over the arcade and then come back in time to finish it.

2791
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:41,360
Yes.

2792
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:42,360
That was fun.

2793
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:43,360
Good times.

2794
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:47,480
Yeah, so I don't know how we got from PS2 titles to make edit get porn, but there you

2795
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,480
go.

2796
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:51,080
I got all that Excel saga in the hell edit contest.

2797
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:52,080
That was it.

2798
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:53,080
That's right.

2799
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,680
A lot of the porn was actually softcore Skidamax porn, but it was still...

2800
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:56,680
It was not good stuff.

2801
02:14:56,680 --> 02:14:57,680
No, it was...

2802
02:14:57,680 --> 02:14:59,600
Well, there was a reason why Loki was giving away...

2803
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,600
The winner...

2804
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:01,600
Whatever happened to Dave?

2805
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:02,600
Whatever happened to him?

2806
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,600
He got two boxes.

2807
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:09,520
Boxes of like 60 titles in there.

2808
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:10,800
Boxes of porn.

2809
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:14,320
He took it home and we never heard from him again.

2810
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:15,320
Exactly.

2811
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:16,320
Oh my God.

2812
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:17,320
Is he still alive?

2813
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:18,320
We need to...

2814
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:19,320
That, that, that.

2815
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:22,120
Or is he still fapping right now?

2816
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:23,120
I don't know.

2817
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:24,120
All right.

2818
02:15:24,120 --> 02:15:25,120
Moving on.

2819
02:15:25,120 --> 02:15:26,120
Dark Sakura.

2820
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:27,120
What you got for us?

2821
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:28,120
More news.

2822
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:29,120
Yeah.

2823
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:30,120
More news.

2824
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:33,040
Although Robin Gaughan is going to have to ask you your help with the mailbag today.

2825
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:34,040
Dark Tetsuya is pointing out...

2826
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:35,040
That's fine.

2827
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,040
I'll do me a mic.

2828
02:15:36,040 --> 02:15:38,440
Dark Tetsuya is pointing out that, uh, that highlight is on the best hits that you can

2829
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:41,940
download at orangelaundry.com.

2830
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:43,640
So check it.

2831
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:50,280
Well, um, there is, um, something about Activision working on a golden eye title for the Wii

2832
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:53,640
and the DS to be released in November.

2833
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:59,600
And it's theorized to be, um, a remake of the Nintendo 64 version that Rare put out.

2834
02:15:59,600 --> 02:16:03,440
I'm going to actually just interrupt you real quick because our stream actually just went

2835
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:05,640
down while you were reading the beginning of that story.

2836
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:06,640
Well, crap.

2837
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:07,640
We had a little bork in the feed.

2838
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:08,640
I don't know what happened.

2839
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:09,640
It went down.

2840
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:11,560
But I do show we are reconnected right now.

2841
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:15,360
It's still recording for the podcast anyway, so I apologize, but we're going to do just

2842
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:16,820
like a live take two.

2843
02:16:16,820 --> 02:16:19,840
So Dark Sakura, would you start in again with that lovely story while people reconnect?

2844
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:22,120
And here I was using my porn voice.

2845
02:16:22,120 --> 02:16:23,120
Anyway.

2846
02:16:23,120 --> 02:16:24,960
Oh man, you guys missed it.

2847
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:25,960
It was so hot.

2848
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:28,960
No, I'm just kidding.

2849
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:36,080
So, Activision is working on a James Bond game, a golden eye title, Rob.

2850
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:40,720
And it's supposed to be out for Wii and the DS, um, in theory released in November.

2851
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:46,480
Uh, one of the, uh, going rumors about it is that it will be a remake of the Nintendo

2852
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:51,200
64 version, which as we all know is epic, classic, the game.

2853
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:54,120
The game made me sick.

2854
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:55,120
Sick to my stomach.

2855
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:58,840
Perfect Dark was redone recently and it was pretty, pretty awesome.

2856
02:16:58,840 --> 02:16:59,840
That's true.

2857
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:07,440
Um, but, um, Activision basically let it off, um, at the point that they registered domain

2858
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:11,000
names that were named after the film.

2859
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So we might see that coming and, you know, they also did work on, um, The World Is Not

2860
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Enough, right?

2861
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,880
Uh, they've done the last few Bond films.

2862
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:28,680
They have, you know, the rights to do the games for them.

2863
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:35,080
So, I mean, if they bring us out and if they bring us out a remade golden eye, that will

2864
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:36,080
be pretty hot.

2865
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:37,080
That's going to be fun.

2866
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:38,080
But you know what?

2867
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:39,400
I don't think it'll be as good as the original.

2868
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:40,400
That's just the problem.

2869
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,040
You know, nothing is really as ever good as the original.

2870
02:17:42,040 --> 02:17:45,120
I don't think anything's going to accurately capture the magic of the original.

2871
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:52,680
Well, I beg to differ, because as I said in part A, when Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes

2872
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:57,680
came out on the GameCube, it was a fairly kick ass version.

2873
02:17:57,680 --> 02:18:04,640
And don't forget the Resident Evil update, where they did Resident Evil on GameCube,

2874
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:05,640
and it was really hot.

2875
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:07,320
Alright, I'll give you that.

2876
02:18:07,320 --> 02:18:09,400
There have been remakes done right.

2877
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:10,400
Alright, we'll see.

2878
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:13,640
They just have to make sure to stick with the essence of the game.

2879
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:14,640
Alright.

2880
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:18,800
I do want to remind folks, sometimes we can't control the downtime of the feed.

2881
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:22,440
There's just random hiccups, although I like this comment from SSJ100Matt.

2882
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:26,720
Speaking of porn, who's watching it in studio, he said right as the feed went down.

2883
02:18:26,720 --> 02:18:28,840
Not me.

2884
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:29,840
It's comcastic.

2885
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:30,840
What can I say?

2886
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:32,320
It happens sometimes.

2887
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:37,000
Anyhow, let's move on with a few more news stories, then we're going to get to the mailbag.

2888
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:40,440
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com, we answer your emails live, on air.

2889
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:41,440
Good times.

2890
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:42,440
Loki.

2891
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:46,720
Grand Theft Horse, awesome.

2892
02:18:46,720 --> 02:18:53,760
So apparently there's been some ratings that have leaked up from the Korean ratings board,

2893
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:57,720
and these are some Dreamcast titles that are going to be ported to Xbox Live Arcade.

2894
02:18:57,720 --> 02:19:04,280
Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi, they have been submitted for ratings, and of course

2895
02:19:04,280 --> 02:19:08,600
Sega was unable to officially comment on the ratings.

2896
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:15,400
But Sonic Adventure has popped up before, I guess they had some screenshots leak out

2897
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:21,200
a little bit ago, and Crazy Taxi, I think the same thing.

2898
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,880
Not that I know or anything, but Sonic Adventure is most definitely real.

2899
02:19:25,880 --> 02:19:28,400
Crazy Taxi is probably the same.

2900
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:33,200
I would not be surprised if these get announced at E3.

2901
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:36,280
Do you think there's a chance they're going to come out and say, and they're out today!

2902
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,280
Because that happens once in a while.

2903
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,120
Sonic Adventure is done, so yeah, I can see that.

2904
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:41,120
You can see that happening.

2905
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:42,120
It's been done for a while.

2906
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:43,120
Definitely can see that happening, huh?

2907
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:48,000
Same as Sonic 4, but they're taking their damn time.

2908
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,240
Well, let's move on with some more news, and then I guess I'm going to do the mailbag tonight.

2909
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,120
Dark Sakura is not feeling up to it.

2910
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:55,120
No, that's fine.

2911
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:57,120
My voice has finally decided to crap out.

2912
02:19:57,120 --> 02:19:58,120
Alright, that's fine.

2913
02:19:58,120 --> 02:20:02,520
But I'll talk about this, and maybe this is the perk up that Dark Sakura needs, because

2914
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:03,520
this will be fun.

2915
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:05,880
There's a new game coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

2916
02:20:05,880 --> 02:20:12,680
It's from Ubisoft, the makers of Let's Dance, and it's called Dance on Broadway.

2917
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:15,680
That's right, 20 songs from Broadway musicals.

2918
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,560
Dude, what's in it?

2919
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:28,040
All That Jazz, Roxy, Cabaret, Money Money, Dream Girls, One Night Only, Luck Be a Lady,

2920
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:32,840
We're in the Money, Lullaby of Broadway, You Can't Stop the Beat, Good Morning Baltimore,

2921
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:45,240
Fame, My Favorite Things, Bend and Snap, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Little Shop of Horrors, Aquarius,

2922
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:54,920
Let the Sun Shine In, and, and, and, and, The Time Warp, Dark Sakura's making woo-face

2923
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:57,920
right now, but you can't hear her.

2924
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:02,080
I already know how to do The Time Warp, it's just a jump to the left, and then a step to

2925
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,080
the right.

2926
02:21:03,080 --> 02:21:05,240
But this is supposed to be like Just Dance.

2927
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:07,640
It's pretty much a sequel to Just Dance, right?

2928
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:10,800
Yeah, except they're going to have Just Dance too, so.

2929
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:14,400
Well, it's like Guitar Hero 80s edition.

2930
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:20,480
It's Just Dance, super duper gay edition, and that's okay.

2931
02:21:20,480 --> 02:21:21,880
There's nothing wrong with that.

2932
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:26,840
This actually reminds me that people need to stay tuned for Cage Match tonight, speaking

2933
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:27,840
of show tunes.

2934
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:29,880
Oh heavens, why is that?

2935
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:33,080
Speaking of show tunes, that's all.

2936
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:36,760
By the way, for those of you guys that have never listened live before, you should tune

2937
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:40,160
in, because we do some extra stuff live that we don't do on the podcast, just a little

2938
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:43,900
bit, nothing too much, we don't want to leave our podcasties in the dark, but there's certain

2939
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:48,920
things we can do live that we can't do on the podcast, like play copyright music, so,

2940
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:53,960
you know, and clips of extended things, so do listen live sometime.

2941
02:21:53,960 --> 02:21:58,440
Anyhow, in the meantime, we're going to do something we can do on the podcast and live,

2942
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:10,160
we love to do this segment every week, it is the mailbag.

2943
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:14,000
Next link in our chatroom says, nothing from Wicked, fail.

2944
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,800
No, I actually don't like Wicked.

2945
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:16,800
Really?

2946
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:17,800
Oh my gosh.

2947
02:22:17,800 --> 02:22:20,240
Well, no, because I read the book.

2948
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:26,440
I can't listen to this as a musical, because the book was so dark and gorgeous.

2949
02:22:26,440 --> 02:22:30,620
Alright, let's see the emails, because there's a lot tonight, because we kind of have a backlog

2950
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:34,800
from all the shows that we didn't do the past couple weeks, so I'm going to start off tonight

2951
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:42,000
with this one from, oh, that's a spam email that came in.

2952
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:48,600
Let's do, I don't see a name on that one, let's try this one instead.

2953
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:52,760
Let's do, and I'm not going to be able to get to all the emails tonight, because there's

2954
02:22:52,760 --> 02:22:56,480
so many guys, sorry guys, Redertainment.

2955
02:22:56,480 --> 02:23:00,640
Dear OLR, I was listening to your midweek discussion of the inclusion of a keytar in

2956
02:23:00,640 --> 02:23:03,400
the next Rock Band game, and a thought came to my mind.

2957
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:07,060
If this keytar is a plastic instrument with the keys on the body instead of the neck,

2958
02:23:07,060 --> 02:23:10,220
isn't that like playing the plastic guitar backward?

2959
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:14,640
I don't mean playing it left-handed, but playing the guitar turned 180 degrees with the keys

2960
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:15,640
on your lap?

2961
02:23:15,640 --> 02:23:21,680
Also, it seems to me that every numbered version of Rock Band gives the gaming public another

2962
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:25,820
gaming-related plastic dust magnet that is incompatible with other games, but gamers

2963
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:28,320
feel compelled by to play the game.

2964
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:33,360
Rock Band gave us a guitar, Rock Band 2 gave us a complete band set, Rock Band 3 will give

2965
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:35,200
us a keytar.

2966
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:38,000
That makes me wonder, I know, hold on, we got a correction there.

2967
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,760
That makes me wonder what useless plastic space hog Rock Band 4 will bring us.

2968
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:44,200
I vote for maracas, wait.

2969
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:47,620
Actually, one small correction to your email, dude, I get what you're saying, but here's

2970
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:53,380
the thing, Rock Band, think of the name, Rock Band, it actually was the full set.

2971
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:57,880
Rock Band was the guitar, drum, and microphone, even in the first game.

2972
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:02,000
Here's where you might be getting confused, because Harmonix did originally make Guitar

2973
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,960
Hero, which was just the guitar, but you might remember they relinquished control of that

2974
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:11,300
to Activision, or Activision took control back, whatever, and made Neversoft make Guitar

2975
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:15,520
Hero 3, and that's the year that Rock Band also came out.

2976
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:18,720
So that might be where your confusion's coming from.

2977
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:23,160
Nevertheless, I get what you're saying, but I kind of forgive them, because they're not

2978
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:24,720
doing a new game every year.

2979
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:28,460
I mean, yes, there was Beatles, yes, there was Green Day, but it's been a little while

2980
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:30,140
since Rock Band 2 now.

2981
02:24:30,140 --> 02:24:34,720
So if it's one more plastic instrument to put in my house after two years, eh, I'm okay

2982
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:39,240
with it, especially if they are selling this in the configuration where I only have to

2983
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:43,960
buy the one instrument and the game, because all my other old-ass instruments still work.

2984
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:48,240
My Guitar Hero 2 guitar still works, and it's fine.

2985
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:51,720
So there you go.

2986
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:59,080
Our good buddy Rob with two B's, Rob-a-ba-ba-ba, sends us some impressions on Prince of Persia.

2987
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:03,520
Says, my boyfriend is a non-gamer, but he really enjoyed the Prince of Persia, The Sands

2988
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:04,520
of Time.

2989
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:05,840
I thought it was fun to watch, too.

2990
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:10,540
The criticism that Jake Gyllenhaal was too Caucasian for the role were unfounded.

2991
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:14,280
That's because the other two princes in the movie were whiter.

2992
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:15,880
Funny.

2993
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:21,360
Again, another thing I'm surprised I'm not hearing a lot of comment on this week.

2994
02:25:21,360 --> 02:25:23,120
Loki, did you happen to see the movie?

2995
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:24,120
No.

2996
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:25,880
I didn't bother either.

2997
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:33,040
The only movie I watched this week is not out yet, so obviously not legally.

2998
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:34,720
But it was a good movie!

2999
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:37,680
And hopefully it will come out over here at some point, but it's just not yet.

3000
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:42,520
Now, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Rob Wake continues, I can't put my finger on why Super Mario

3001
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:46,160
Galaxy 2 is so much more fun when compared to Super Mario Galaxy.

3002
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:51,220
I like both, but the star gathering in Super Mario Galaxy 2 does not feel like work.

3003
02:25:51,220 --> 02:25:53,920
Some of those SMG stars were hard work.

3004
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,560
There doesn't seem to be as much pressure to replay levels for stars, either.

3005
02:25:57,560 --> 02:26:01,520
I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the game, especially after hearing the Super Mario 64

3006
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:03,440
classic as the game of the week.

3007
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:07,360
Tune into a future episode when one of us has actually played the damn game, but my

3008
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:08,560
Wii's just not hooked up right now.

3009
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,640
My Wii's semi-bricked from New Super Mario Brothers.

3010
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:14,200
Blur and these other games that play it.

3011
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:15,520
Really, your Wii got bricked?

3012
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:16,520
Semi-bricked.

3013
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:17,520
What's that mean?

3014
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:21,640
Semi-bricked is when you play a game of a different region on your system, and what

3015
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:27,760
happens is a second update gets put in there, and so now I can play games on it, but I can't

3016
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:32,040
go into the system menu and change settings, so I have to fix it.

3017
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:36,960
I've just been so lazy to fix it, I just, I really don't care, to be honest.

3018
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:42,840
It's just, I've been too busy playing other games and to actually go and play, you know,

3019
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:48,200
New Super Mario Brothers or Super Mario Galaxy 2, it's just, I just don't feel compelled

3020
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:52,100
to do so, even if it's super awesome.

3021
02:26:52,100 --> 02:26:55,000
It's just, I don't know.

3022
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,880
Although my trait other end looks pretty nice.

3023
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:01,440
I watched a new video of that this weekend, it looks pretty cool.

3024
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:03,920
It's just getting to be a busy time of year, especially with it's summer and all, it's

3025
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:04,920
only going to get worse.

3026
02:27:04,920 --> 02:27:05,920
It is.

3027
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:06,920
It's only going to get worse.

3028
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:11,840
And like, you know, as far as games coming out, man, as far as what I'm planning on getting,

3029
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:14,200
pretty much just cracked down to this summer and that's it.

3030
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:17,160
I mean, there's going to be a few months where I'm not really playing anything new, which

3031
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:21,220
is fine because I have tons of other stuff to play, but it's just, I don't really want

3032
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:24,960
to get anything that I don't think I'm going to play.

3033
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:25,960
Metroid Other M?

3034
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:30,040
Uh, well I guess Metroid Other M, but I mean, that's like at the very end of the summer.

3035
02:27:30,040 --> 02:27:33,040
And actually, you know, I might not get it right away because, you know, Kid will be

3036
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:34,040
born right then, so.

3037
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:35,040
Oh yeah, that's true.

3038
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,040
We'll have time.

3039
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:40,120
Im2good in our chat room, I like that nickname by the way, Im2good says, Prince of Persia

3040
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:44,400
is an average movie, but that means it's like the moon landing for video game movies.

3041
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:50,400
One small step for man, one giant leap for video game movies to not be a turd of shit.

3042
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:54,160
I like the turd is now a measurement of shit, as opposed to just being another name.

3043
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:55,160
Alright.

3044
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:56,760
I thought it was the Keurig.

3045
02:27:56,760 --> 02:27:57,760
Forget it.

3046
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:59,960
Moving on.

3047
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:03,400
Another email from Rob Babula that I want to bring up here, he's suggesting that we

3048
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:06,200
should play the 3-6-9 music from Schoolhouse Rock for the show.

3049
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:08,480
I'm sorry, I didn't have it queued up, my bad.

3050
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:10,920
But I do want to address this other point in the email.

3051
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:16,120
Also, two weeks ago, I saw my first Tron-a-rail in Disney World, that's just what we called

3052
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:19,240
it, but it turned out to be the official name for the decorated trains.

3053
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:20,920
Any sightings in Disneyland?

3054
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:25,640
I don't believe they've redone the monorail as Tron, I don't think they're planning to

3055
02:28:25,640 --> 02:28:29,520
do that, but you never know, when it gets a little closer to the movie releases.

3056
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:33,620
There was a rumor that the people mover with Tron was going to come back, but I'm not holding

3057
02:28:33,620 --> 02:28:37,200
my breath on that, I think if it does, it ain't happening this year.

3058
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,040
But no, nothing in Disneyland yet.

3059
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:43,040
So we're all waiting on pins and needles that hopefully the people mover will reopen.

3060
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:47,160
And also of note, not to turn this into a Disney podcast, but in about what, one more

3061
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:48,160
month?

3062
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:54,760
Star Tours will close, and Star Tours is no longer going to be there in its current form.

3063
02:28:54,760 --> 02:28:55,760
They're redoing it for...

3064
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:58,720
There's going to be a Star Wars 2.0 that comes out later.

3065
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:02,640
And they're going to make it all stupid in the prequels, so whatever.

3066
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,680
If it's the pod race, I'm okay with that, because the pod race, that's the rumor that

3067
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:10,140
it's a pod race right now, and that might be kind of cool.

3068
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:13,960
And hopefully you get to run over Jar Jar Binks, that would be amazing.

3069
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:16,720
And if Greg Proops is still one of the commentators, that's also amazing.

3070
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:18,720
That would be awesome.

3071
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,640
Oh, that's right, yeah, he was a commentator.

3072
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:22,640
He was one of the two heads.

3073
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,640
I remember that.

3074
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:29,600
No, it'd be funny though, like Robot Chicken and stuff, where they have all the Jar Jar

3075
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:35,960
Binks stuff, they should just make it look like it's going to be some sort of pod race,

3076
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:40,160
lock the doors, and then it's just all Jar Jar Binks talking to you for a good like five

3077
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,160
minutes.

3078
02:29:41,160 --> 02:29:44,440
Oh god, children would cry and run screaming away.

3079
02:29:44,440 --> 02:29:48,040
I would complain that my day was not magical.

3080
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:49,040
I was not magical.

3081
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:51,840
I am not having a magical day now.

3082
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:54,760
Alright, moving on.

3083
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:58,520
This comes from Shook.

3084
02:29:58,520 --> 02:29:59,520
Big S, Big K.

3085
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:01,160
Hi, OLR.

3086
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:02,880
I'm here for a rant.

3087
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:05,480
Lately in zombie discussions or something similar.

3088
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:08,960
People act like they know everything about shotguns and.44s, etc.

3089
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:12,460
When really they're from a big city and have been nowhere near a gun except maybe in their

3090
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:13,460
little gang.

3091
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:17,240
I'm not trying to sound like some country bumpkin, but it really pisses me off when

3092
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:18,480
they act like know-it-alls.

3093
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:19,480
What are your thoughts?

3094
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:20,480
Well...

3095
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:23,600
Don't make me bust out my Glock.

3096
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,600
I don't think anyone like really wants to shoot somebody in the face.

3097
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:32,720
Like in Red Dead Redemption, it's just like funny to see, does that make sense?

3098
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:37,280
I am an adult, I understand what is fiction and what is real, I'm not gonna go shoot someone

3099
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,000
in the face if it's gonna kill them.

3100
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,600
And I will be the first to admit, I don't know the difference between all these different

3101
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:46,680
types of guns because I don't like guns and I would never own a gun.

3102
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:47,680
Wait, what guns?

3103
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:48,680
What are we talking about guns?

3104
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:49,680
Shotguns and.44s, etc.

3105
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,880
They're just saying I know everything about these guns.

3106
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:53,600
Not me specifically, but just people.

3107
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:54,800
You know how I learned a lot about...

3108
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:57,000
I can't wait until I own a gun.

3109
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:01,040
You know how I learned a lot about guns from playing Airsoft.

3110
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:03,800
Because a lot of the guns that they have out there are modeled in...

3111
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:09,840
Now I can say, hey, that's an MP7, oh hey, that's a G36.

3112
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,280
So it's kind of cool.

3113
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:16,720
You know how I learned about guns very well?

3114
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:17,720
Writing G.I.

3115
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:19,640
Joe fan fiction about ten years ago.

3116
02:31:19,640 --> 02:31:20,720
I'm not joking.

3117
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:22,120
This is a human.

3118
02:31:22,120 --> 02:31:24,080
Ten years ago, I was writing G.I.

3119
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:25,960
Joe fan fiction.

3120
02:31:25,960 --> 02:31:27,420
And I did my research.

3121
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:34,400
I have no interest in firing a gun that is not of the laser variety or the shooting range.

3122
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:36,960
I do still want a Hello Kitty assault rifle.

3123
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:38,440
We should go out to the shooting range.

3124
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:39,440
I wanna go.

3125
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:41,480
My friend used to go down there.

3126
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:43,520
I was gonna go with him, but he moved too soon.

3127
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:45,040
I'll have to take a picture of this.

3128
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:46,040
Santa Cruz.

3129
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:48,380
Dan got to shoot off a.50 caliber.

3130
02:31:48,380 --> 02:31:52,000
One more, you guys, from dragonboy69.

3131
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,880
I was wondering if any of you might know why some games, specifically Vagrant Story and

3132
02:31:55,880 --> 02:32:00,600
Breath of Fire 3, show up on the Japan and European PSN store, but not on the North American

3133
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:01,600
store.

3134
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:02,600
Thanks for any help you can provide.

3135
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:03,600
Keep up the great work.

3136
02:32:03,600 --> 02:32:07,760
Because Vagrant Story sucked?

3137
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:08,760
But here's the thing.

3138
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:10,120
Just sometimes it's a rights issue.

3139
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:12,520
And Final Fantasy 9, I think, is another big one, right?

3140
02:32:12,520 --> 02:32:16,480
It's showing up in other stores, but not the current one.

3141
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:20,240
It's rights issues and sometimes timing and other things.

3142
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:21,920
It's sometimes kind of complicated.

3143
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:25,460
I think it has to do with the fact that sometimes different companies publish different games

3144
02:32:25,460 --> 02:32:28,160
in different countries, and that sometimes complicates things.

3145
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:30,320
But I think Wikipedia keeps a pretty good list of what's available.

3146
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:31,320
Time localization, too.

3147
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:32,320
Yeah, it's true, too.

3148
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:40,000
I'm posting this picture up on the site of my Hello Kitty holding a.50 caliber shell.

3149
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:45,720
And also, too, it's sometimes just the ability for that company to be able to distribute

3150
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,480
the game in a timely manner.

3151
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:53,880
For example, Morph-X, which was a game that came out in Europe just recently, is actually

3152
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:57,920
region coded for both Europe and the North American regions.

3153
02:32:57,920 --> 02:33:02,280
So in theory, you could actually release the game here, and it would be just fine.

3154
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:06,660
But for whatever reason, it may have not passed the ratings board yet.

3155
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:11,280
Maybe they don't have enough manpower to actually duplicate the units that they need.

3156
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:19,480
Because some of these companies, like Graffiti Entertainment or Zoo Games and stuff, their

3157
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:25,280
titles go for sometimes years if delays before they're actually released.

3158
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:26,280
It's ridiculous.

3159
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:27,280
Graffiti Entertainment.

3160
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:30,200
That's going to do it for our mailbag.

3161
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:31,720
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

3162
02:33:31,720 --> 02:33:33,720
If you'd like to send us an email, please do.

3163
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:36,160
Mailbag at Orangeloungeradio.com.

3164
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:40,560
After the mailbag is usually the section of the show where we get a little irritated,

3165
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:44,160
and we do a little segment on the show called the FUs of the Week.

3166
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:45,160
Why?

3167
02:33:45,160 --> 02:33:46,160
Because we can.

3168
02:33:46,160 --> 02:34:05,840
And if you need a little inspiration, we have an inspiration for your FU story tonight.

3169
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:10,440
It's about a Virginia man named Bruce Jamar Walston.

3170
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:15,200
Apparently authorities were called to his apartment by the girlfriend, because apparently

3171
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:20,800
a couple nights ago, the woman called 911.

3172
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:22,280
You're not going to like this, folks.

3173
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:24,640
You're really not going to like this, okay?

3174
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:28,520
And this really doesn't have anything to do with video games, but it does, because it's

3175
02:34:28,520 --> 02:34:30,480
making the rounds on video game blogs.

3176
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:33,320
But you're not going to like it.

3177
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:36,400
You're really not going to like this, okay?

3178
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:42,720
Apparently the guy here that was arrested, Bruce Walston, was angered that the video

3179
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:48,440
game he was playing was disconnected by his girlfriend's new kitten.

3180
02:34:48,440 --> 02:34:50,960
So he picked up the animal.

3181
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:56,400
I'm not going to say what happened, but the animal died.

3182
02:34:56,400 --> 02:35:04,600
And this all occurred, wait for it, wait for it, in front of the woman's children.

3183
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:08,780
He's being held without bond at the Middle River Regional Jarrell in Verona, in case

3184
02:35:08,780 --> 02:35:11,400
you want to send him your cards and letters.

3185
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:14,640
For killing a kitten for unplugging the video game console.

3186
02:35:14,640 --> 02:35:18,360
Not only did he kill the cat, he did it in front of the children.

3187
02:35:18,360 --> 02:35:19,360
Way to go!

3188
02:35:19,360 --> 02:35:20,360
Psychopath.

3189
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,360
You ass!

3190
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:22,360
God.

3191
02:35:22,360 --> 02:35:25,160
That's mental problems.

3192
02:35:25,160 --> 02:35:26,160
You know what, though?

3193
02:35:26,160 --> 02:35:27,480
Can I side rant?

3194
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:31,600
I realize, you know, I'm out of order here, but can I just side rant here?

3195
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:35,680
I really hate it when video game blogs kind of run with these stories, and maybe I hate

3196
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,440
myself for bringing this up, or bringing it up in this context of this guy is an asshole.

3197
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:44,800
But like, this really has nothing to do with video games, and it just gives video gamers

3198
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,220
a bad name.

3199
02:35:46,220 --> 02:35:50,960
This guy is a parasite of society, end of story.

3200
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:55,460
He needs to be shot out of a cannon into a land far, far away, where we will never see

3201
02:35:55,460 --> 02:35:57,480
or hear from him again.

3202
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:58,480
That's really it.

3203
02:35:58,480 --> 02:36:03,520
I mean, why would you throw a kitten against the, I almost said what happened there, and

3204
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:07,680
I said I would not, because it would happen to the cat, but why would you kill a cat in

3205
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,360
front of the children?

3206
02:36:09,360 --> 02:36:11,480
That is just effed up beyond belief.

3207
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:13,640
Oh my god, this guy's picture?

3208
02:36:13,640 --> 02:36:18,560
I know, he just looks like a winner, doesn't he?

3209
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,560
I know.

3210
02:36:19,560 --> 02:36:20,560
I know.

3211
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:22,120
What a piece of shit.

3212
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:24,680
Alright, so anyway.

3213
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:25,680
Who would like to start?

3214
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:26,680
Good without Bond.

3215
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:28,200
Would you like to start off with the FUs of the week, Darcy?

3216
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:29,800
Do you have some inspiration now?

3217
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:30,800
I'm disgusted.

3218
02:36:30,800 --> 02:36:34,280
I know, it's disgusting, I thought you wouldn't like it.

3219
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:36,280
My turn up.

3220
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:37,280
What?

3221
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:43,680
Dan said it's better he didn't kill the kid, it's better than him.

3222
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:46,840
Dan is yelling from the living room, Jamie would be less mad if the guy had killed the

3223
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:47,840
kid.

3224
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:48,840
Whatever.

3225
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:52,760
It's still messed up, no matter what, it's messed up.

3226
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:53,760
Alright.

3227
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:54,760
I'm gonna make mine quick.

3228
02:36:54,760 --> 02:36:55,760
Yes.

3229
02:36:55,760 --> 02:37:00,640
My first FU goes towards losing my voice and a little bit of cough I have left.

3230
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:11,160
My next one is a humongous FU to Helen Thomas, who is one of the senior White House press

3231
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:19,040
corps members who basically went on record saying that Jews should get out of Palestine

3232
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:21,360
and go back to Germany or Poland.

3233
02:37:21,360 --> 02:37:22,360
Yeah.

3234
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:28,000
She didn't say go back to Jew land.

3235
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:35,360
Well, it's, first of all, telling people to go back to places that, you know, they basically

3236
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:43,120
left due to, how about being murdered, you know, to go back to their homeland is just

3237
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:44,120
really insensitive.

3238
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:47,960
Maybe Helen Thomas should go back to her homeland, because I don't think she's Native American,

3239
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:52,640
so um, boat's coming, get on it, bye.

3240
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:58,440
It's just really, really, and you know, the only reason, she did apologize for it, but

3241
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:03,200
the only reason I think she apologized for it is because they called her on it, and now

3242
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:09,080
they're calling for her resignation, or her to get sacked, and honestly, I agree.

3243
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:15,840
Now if she had her own personal private blog and said this as herself with a these views

3244
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:22,640
do not reflect White House blah, blah, blah, fine, insensitive, shitty as hell, you're

3245
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:27,640
still a bitch, but, but this is America.

3246
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:28,640
We do.

3247
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:31,020
She has the right to be a bitch and we have the right to call her a bitch.

3248
02:38:31,020 --> 02:38:36,960
That's a free speech is all about to say it in her capacity in a public forum as a representative

3249
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:40,240
of the White House press corps as a senior representative.

3250
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:45,200
Now tell me that's just not highly irresponsible and incredibly insensitive.

3251
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:50,560
I think she should get sacked and drawn behind a cart by her toes.

3252
02:38:50,560 --> 02:38:53,760
I want to see Obama just punch her on the White House lawn, that'd be amazing.

3253
02:38:53,760 --> 02:39:01,480
She's a good bitch, but yeah, and that's not that I'm advocating violence, but in special

3254
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:02,480
circumstances it's okay.

3255
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:08,320
And you know what, it's funny because her apology is not even, she's saying that she

3256
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:12,960
deeply regretted the comments I made last week regarding Israelis and Palestinians.

3257
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:17,280
They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when

3258
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:21,760
all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance, may that day come soon.

3259
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:24,760
She didn't really address what she said.

3260
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:25,800
Not at all.

3261
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:30,120
She just let out a blanket statement to appease everybody that doesn't really address the

3262
02:39:30,120 --> 02:39:31,120
problem.

3263
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:34,900
She, if she was going to have any sincerity of it, she needs to say, you know what?

3264
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:40,360
I was wrong, sorry.

3265
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:41,360
Nasty woman.

3266
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:42,560
She looks nasty.

3267
02:39:42,560 --> 02:39:46,080
I'm seriously, she looks like, like the picture of a hag.

3268
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:48,440
Alright, let's move on.

3269
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:49,440
Loki!

3270
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:56,480
Uh, F you to myself for having the obsessive compulsion to spend money on stupid things

3271
02:39:56,480 --> 02:40:02,560
that I really don't need to spend money on, like Project Under $100, for example.

3272
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:08,400
Not that that's going to stop me from doing it, and also F you to the fact that I don't

3273
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:12,960
have any airsoft guns, because, or, and I'm also not in the airsoft gun really right now

3274
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:17,520
because I don't have any airsoft guns, because I really want the Magpulpty SFPG.

3275
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:22,800
The folding pocket gun looks so awesome, and it's a gun that folds out of a briefcase shape

3276
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:27,680
into a, like a little personal assault rifle, and that's awesome, good times, but it's also

3277
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:31,320
really expensive and I don't need it, at least I'm not buying that.

3278
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:36,720
Um, my F you of the week goes to, um, the returning side panes that I've been having,

3279
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:40,040
because, uh, yeah, that's why I went to the hospital a couple years ago and I really don't

3280
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:41,040
want to go back.

3281
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:44,240
Um, maybe it's Mother Nature trying to tell me I need to go on a diet again.

3282
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:47,120
I don't know, but I don't like being freaked out like that.

3283
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:48,120
It sucks.

3284
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:50,280
I F you to my body.

3285
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:51,280
Wah.

3286
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:55,680
Alright, uh, let's move on with, uh, just a couple more news stories for you guys, then

3287
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:57,320
the Skype line.

3288
02:40:57,320 --> 02:40:58,600
We'll get to the Skype line here.

3289
02:40:58,600 --> 02:41:01,840
Uh, admittedly it's going to be a little bit shorter Skype line tonight, because, uh, we

3290
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:05,640
had a really long show, and we still have an afterbirth yet too before it gets too late,

3291
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:08,240
but, uh, we will at least take some calls here in just a little bit.

3292
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:10,800
In the meantime, Loki, what you got for us?

3293
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:17,560
Games Convention Online in Leipzig is actually going to be going, um, industry only this

3294
02:41:17,560 --> 02:41:18,560
year.

3295
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:27,320
Apparently, um, I guess they had 43,000 attendees in 2009, and, um, you know, now they're just

3296
02:41:27,320 --> 02:41:34,740
saying the number of registered public exhibitors was insufficient, and that the satisfied interest

3297
02:41:34,740 --> 02:41:40,440
of the visitors, whose past experiences bring them with high expectations to Leipzig, um,

3298
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:46,680
it doesn't make sense why they're going to cut it, but they're planning on, um, I guess,

3299
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:52,640
um, having 30 companies attending this year, which is already bigger than last year, but,

3300
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:55,440
um, it will not be open to the public.

3301
02:41:55,440 --> 02:42:00,600
So it's basically, this show's got too many common folk at it, so, uh, in order for our

3302
02:42:00,600 --> 02:42:01,600
show to get bigger-

3303
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,600
For business to happen.

3304
02:42:02,600 --> 02:42:03,920
It's basically what E3 did.

3305
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:04,920
Yeah.

3306
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:10,560
But, I mean, this is a good, maybe a good example of why we don't have E3 open to the

3307
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:14,520
public, because it would be a nut house.

3308
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:17,120
Alright.

3309
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:21,120
Let's move on with one more story here, and this is more of a wrap-up here.

3310
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:25,400
There's, um, actually some things going around out there that show what some of the confirmed

3311
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:27,640
games that are going to be shown at E3 are.

3312
02:42:27,640 --> 02:42:30,280
Let me run down some of the, uh, companies here and some of the games that they're going

3313
02:42:30,280 --> 02:42:31,280
to be showing.

3314
02:42:31,280 --> 02:42:34,160
2K Games is going to be showing Mafia 2.

3315
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:39,360
And keep in mind, this is only announced stuff, because there's always surprises, always,

3316
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:40,960
always, always surprises at E3.

3317
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:45,200
So don't take this as, like, the definitive list of the only things being shown at E3.

3318
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:47,600
This is just what is confirmed thus far.

3319
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:54,000
2K Games is showing Mafia 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V, Spec Ops The Line, and XCOM.

3320
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,440
I didn't even know they were remaking XCOM, right?

3321
02:42:56,440 --> 02:43:01,060
Yeah, it's supposed to be not so much like, it's more like a first-person shooter now.

3322
02:43:01,060 --> 02:43:04,640
I might remember hearing it on a previous show or something, but this is the first time

3323
02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:07,880
I remember hearing it, um, right now, so.

3324
02:43:07,880 --> 02:43:13,440
Uh, let's see, Activision has Call of Duty Black Ops and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock,

3325
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:16,560
and supposedly that's it, I somehow doubt that.

3326
02:43:16,560 --> 02:43:22,680
Bethesda's bringing Brink, Fallout New Vegas, Hunted the Demons Forge, and Rage.

3327
02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:28,120
Capcom 2 has Dead Rising 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and an untitled sequel.

3328
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:32,400
Uh, let's see, and that's, I'm ignoring the mobile stuff.

3329
02:43:32,400 --> 02:43:37,640
Disney Interactive Studios has Epic Mickey, Guilty Party, Pirates, are they really gonna

3330
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:38,960
call that game Epic Mickey?

3331
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,600
I think that's a stupid title.

3332
02:43:40,600 --> 02:43:42,400
Maybe it's just the working title right now.

3333
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:46,640
God, I hope it is, cause that's a, let me go on record saying that is a stupid name

3334
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:48,280
for a video game.

3335
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:53,760
Pirates of the Caribbean Armada of the Damned, Toy Story 3, Tron Evolution, and Tron Legacy.

3336
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:55,640
Hey, I'm all about checking out the Tron.

3337
02:43:55,640 --> 02:43:56,640
Those are supposed to be cool.

3338
02:43:56,640 --> 02:43:59,280
I wanna see what that looks like, that's gonna be awesome.

3339
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:06,320
Uh, EA is showing APB, Bulletstorm, Crysis 2, Dead Space 2, EA Sports Active 2.0, FIFA

3343

3344
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:33,280
Oops, I crapped my pants party.

3345
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:35,880
Oh my god, Oops! Prank Party.

3346
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:41,840
Konami has Castlevania Puzzle, Angkor of the Night, Castlevania Lords of Shadow, Def Jam

3347
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:49,880
Rap Star, Lucha Libre AAA, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, N399 Nights 2, Pro Evo Soccer

3348
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:57,720
2010, Rocket Knight, Russian Attack Ex-Patriot Saw 2, and the Cages Pro Style Batting Practice.

3349
02:44:57,720 --> 02:45:01,640
As I said earlier in the show, notice no DDR in that list.

3350
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:03,000
Could DDR be dead?

3351
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,200
Nope, I will tell you what they're probably gonna do.

3352
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:07,200
Surprise announcement?

3353
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:11,160
They're gonna make an announcement that's gonna support N-Tall.

3354
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:12,160
You think?

3355
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:13,720
Yeah, I have a feeling.

3356
02:45:13,720 --> 02:45:15,000
Alright, we'll see what happens.

3357
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:18,400
Because you know, Konami, they like doing gimmicky shit that doesn't make any sense

3358
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:20,120
for the franchise whatsoever.

3359
02:45:20,120 --> 02:45:25,280
For example, what they were showing off at last E3 with Dance Dance Revolution, playing

3360
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:29,880
Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii Fit balance board using your ass.

3361
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:31,800
That made no fucking sense.

3362
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:37,320
Do you guys want some video at E3 of me playing Def Jam Rap Star?

3363
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:39,960
You know who I want to see video playing that?

3364
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:40,960
What?

3365
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:41,960
Irene.

3366
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:45,120
Ah, I wish she could go to E3 this year.

3367
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,120
Good times.

3368
02:45:46,120 --> 02:45:47,960
My heart, Irene.

3369
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:52,600

Majesco is bringing Crafting Mama, Greg Hastings, Paintball 2, Swords, and Zumba Fitness.

Microsoft.

3374
02:46:02,680 --> 02:46:04,800
No Babysitting Mama?

3375
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:05,800
Apparently not.

3376
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:06,800
Disappointment.

3377
02:46:06,800 --> 02:46:12,040
Uh, let's see, Microsoft is bringing Fable 3, Gears of War 3, Halo Reach, and Project

Natsume is bringing Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar, and Lufia, Curse of the Sinistrals.

3383
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:35,000

3384
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:36,280
Dude, I remember Lufia.

3385
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:37,760
It's coming back.

3386
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:39,480
It's I think a remake of the old games.

3387
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:40,660
I think I have Lufia.

3388
02:46:40,660 --> 02:46:43,280
It's coming back.

3389
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:48,520
Tokyo's bringing Metroid Other M, The Legend of Zelda Wii, Wii Vitality Sensor Games, and

all their 3DS games.

02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:52,640
No mention of Pokemon Black and White yet, which is interesting.

3392
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:55,480
I would thought that that would be out on the floor, but maybe they're just not ready.

3393
02:46:55,480 --> 02:46:59,440
Maybe that'll be a Tokyo game show, I don't know.

3394
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:01,360
Sega's got Conduit 2.

3395
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:03,200
I didn't know they were making a Conduit 2.

3396
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:04,200
Yeah.

3397
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:05,200

Ooh, The Last Guardian.

3406
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:38,880
That was that epic trailer last year, huh?

3407
02:47:38,880 --> 02:47:39,880
Yeah, it was.

3408
02:47:39,880 --> 02:47:40,880
I remember.

3409
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:41,880
I want to see that.

3410
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:44,560
Sounds awesome.

3411
02:47:44,560 --> 02:47:45,560

3414
02:47:55,080 --> 02:47:58,680
I know that sounds kind of weird that that's at the Squeenix booth, but there's that whole

3415
02:47:58,680 --> 02:47:59,960
merger now.

3416
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:02,280
That's how it works.

3417
02:48:02,280 --> 02:48:03,560

02:49:00,160 --> 02:49:02,000
There it is, a list of what is being shown at E3.

3430
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,680
Sounds like it's going to be a fun year, isn't it?

3431
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:10,320
I'm excited, I'm sorry, that's what I meant, adjectives, not verbs, don't you have all

3432
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:11,880
of it though it seems like?

3433
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:12,880
No.

3434
02:49:12,880 --> 02:49:15,880
It'd be hard to spawn a verb.

3435
02:49:15,880 --> 02:49:17,880
Spawn run.

3436
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:24,760
Alright, well, this is the part of the show where we're going to get to some last minute

3437

stories because, well actually I take that back, we already have calls coming in, let's

3438
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:34,120
go to the Skype line, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio,

3439
02:49:34,120 --> 02:49:36,880
we're going to go to the Skype line right now, we've already got calls coming in, hi,

3440
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:39,880
you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3441
02:49:39,880 --> 02:49:40,880
It's Ray Iyanami.

3442
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:44,520
Hey, Ray Iyanami, what's on your mind, buddy?

3443
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:47,400
I've been bad from Fanime for about a week now.

3444
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:52,500
Fanime was over Memorial Day weekend, sadly I was not there, I was in Portland, but how

3445
02:49:52,500 --> 02:49:55,840
was Fanime this year?

3446
02:49:55,840 --> 02:50:02,800
Pretty fun, it seems to get better every year, and there's a few crappy parts, but it doesn't

3447
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:06,200
detract from the experience as a whole usually.

3448
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:10,080
Well first things first, I've got to ask, since it is a video game show, how is the

3449
02:50:10,080 --> 02:50:11,720
game room at Fanime?

3450
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:17,960
Okay, I can't take it back, so, gaming room for arcades, they had, like the usual stuff

3451
02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:23,840
from last year, but this time they have a few new things like Mushihime-sama and Digimax-Technica,

3452
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:28,760
I was the special side to see Technica, even if they have the Platinum Crew servers, but

3453
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:31,600
I expected it not to be there anyway.

3454
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:35,320
Did they wheel that all over from SVGL or something?

3455
02:50:35,320 --> 02:50:40,320
Actually no, from what I've heard, like some years ago, there was some fallout between

3456
02:50:40,320 --> 02:50:47,720
Fanime and Golf Land, so now Fanime gets their machines from University arcades, like, someone

3457
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:49,640
from San Jose State and UCLA.

3458
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:50,640
Oh, okay.

3459
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:51,640
Gotcha.

3460
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:55,120
So we ended up getting UCLA's machine.

3461
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:57,360
Hmm, interesting.

3462
02:50:57,360 --> 02:51:00,520
Well that's cool, it sounds like game room was fun.

3463
02:51:00,520 --> 02:51:03,680
Most of the game room was a bit of a letdown this year, mainly because there weren't as

3464
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:09,600
many TVs, like, the concentration of people playing fighting games and people playing

3465
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:14,520
other games like Class D, Jameson's Smokes and such was really high this year, like,

3466
02:51:14,520 --> 02:51:22,160
like you pick a random TV, like 4-5 times, it's probably going to be Brawl or something

3467
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:28,080
else like, or Rock Band or something, or like something I say pretty much every damn con

3468
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:31,220
gaming room.

3469
02:51:31,220 --> 02:51:32,220
What about some cosplay?

3470
02:51:32,220 --> 02:51:33,840
Was there any good gaming cosplay?

3471
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:37,280
I know DarkSakuro showed me a picture earlier, I don't think it was from Fanime, but some

3472
02:51:37,280 --> 02:51:38,680
Metal Gear cosplay.

3473
02:51:38,680 --> 02:51:41,520
Was there any good gaming cosplay you saw?

3474
02:51:41,520 --> 02:51:43,680
Umm, yeah.

3475
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:46,480
Well, like what?

3476
02:51:46,480 --> 02:51:50,680
I saw a picture of a Vanille from Final Fantasy XIII that looked really cute, I thought she

3477
02:51:50,680 --> 02:51:51,680
did a good job.

3478
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:52,680
What'd you see?

3479
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:56,360
I saw a lot of Touhou cosplay, though that's mainly because I went to the Touhou Gathering

3480
02:51:56,360 --> 02:52:02,440
and the explosion of, like, Touhou related events on Sunday, I was sad to not see any

3481
02:52:02,440 --> 02:52:04,560
Bimani cosplay like usual.

3482
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:08,360
Well, I hate to tell you, but Bimani's kind of fading out.

3483
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:09,360
Yeah, I know.

3484
02:52:09,360 --> 02:52:14,960
It's just like, I saw a few 2DX cosplayers at SoccerCon, which I didn't get pictures

3485
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:19,200
of much from my Chagrin, or Chagrin, however I'll pronounce that.

3486
02:52:19,200 --> 02:52:22,240
I'm looking at some of your pictures, it looks like there was a Pac-Man there I'm looking

3487
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:27,700
at and I'm looking at a Black Mage and a Sackboy, Loki's Sackboy costume is better though.

3488
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:30,680
I saw some BlazBlue cosplay like Hazama and Lychee.

3489
02:52:30,680 --> 02:52:32,320
Oh, that's cool.

3490
02:52:32,320 --> 02:52:36,760
I saw a couple Captain Falcons, which is one of the alternate palettes from Super Smash

3491
02:52:36,760 --> 02:52:37,760
Brothers, interestingly.

3492
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:45,820
There's also the guy that does British cosplay every year, so glad to see him every year.

3493
02:52:45,820 --> 02:52:48,800
Now what's this about, there were some protesters?

3494
02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:50,600
Were people protesting Faname?

3495
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:51,600
What's up with this?

3496
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:57,320
Uh, they weren't protesting Faname per se, it's basically, you know about those fire

3497
02:52:57,320 --> 02:53:03,120
and brimstone preachers that go turn or burn and such like that?

3498
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:07,160
Oh yeah, yeah, you always see them out, like even when I was in Portland there was one

3499
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:12,780
out at the fair, they do like a cute little fair downtown where a lot of local vendors

3500
02:53:12,780 --> 02:53:16,820
come out and sell their local goods and there was some guy standing there on the street

3501
02:53:16,820 --> 02:53:22,160
corner spouting their whole thing about, you know, everybody's going to hell, and that

3502
02:53:22,160 --> 02:53:23,160
whole thing.

3503
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:24,960
So Faname got a little bit of that?

3504
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:25,960
Yeah.

3505
02:53:25,960 --> 02:53:27,960
Good times.

3506
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:38,200
Oh, I came across a Guitar Freaks V4 machine with EMU slots, but it's not connected to

3507
02:53:38,200 --> 02:53:39,200
EMUs.

3508
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:40,200
Interesting.

3509
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:43,840
Did you actually play some of the Guitar Freaks?

3510
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:47,680
No, I don't really play Guitar Freaks or Drummania.

3511
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:50,920
I'm more of a 2DX person and a DJ Maxx person.

3512
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:52,920
Did they have 2DX?

3513
02:53:52,920 --> 02:53:58,400
Um, yeah they did, but interestingly it was a hacked version of 2DX Empress with DJ Maxx

3514
02:53:58,400 --> 02:54:00,560
crossovers and other things on it.

3515
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:01,560
Huh.

3516
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:05,160
I didn't play it because the screen was laggy and laggy screens make me rage quit.

3517
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:11,360
Wait, wait, wait, there was, there was Technica, I'm sorry, DJ Maxx crossovers in this game?

3518
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:12,360
How was that?

3519
02:54:12,360 --> 02:54:13,360
Is it a hack?

3520
02:54:13,360 --> 02:54:19,320
Yeah, someone has some DJ Maxx songs into 2DX, which is very interesting.

3521
02:54:19,320 --> 02:54:22,800
I've seen a video of it on YouTube before.

3522
02:54:22,800 --> 02:54:26,240
Hmm, interesting.

3523
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:30,240
Well I didn't even know something like that existed, but that's cool.

3524
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:36,160
Well any other thoughts on Faname you want to tell us before we let you go?

3525
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:40,160
I think what Faname could do next year for the console gaming is maybe have one section

3526
02:54:40,160 --> 02:54:46,080
where it's like no fighting games or anything like that, like classic games and shooters

3527
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:51,720
and other things that don't require you to kick ass and have fun.

3528
02:54:51,720 --> 02:54:54,680
I'm all about a classic game room like they have at PAX.

3529
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:55,680
Good stuff.

3530
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:59,960
Yeah, they had one at SoccerCon, they had a retro gaming room where it was mostly like

3531
02:54:59,960 --> 02:55:06,320
stuff, like N64 era stuff and earlier.

3532
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:07,320
Very cool.

3533
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:08,920
Well hopefully we'll be able to make it out next year.

3534
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:11,680
I know we skipped this year, but maybe we'll be back.

3535
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:15,880
I haven't seen you guys since 2007, so I'm getting worried if I'll ever see you at Faname

3536
02:55:15,880 --> 02:55:16,880
again.

3537
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:17,880
Well, we'll try to make it work.

3538
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:18,880
When's California Xtreme?

3539
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:19,880
I saw you asking about that.

3540
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:20,880
That already happened.

3541
02:55:20,880 --> 02:55:21,880
I'll go to Faname next year.

3542
02:55:21,880 --> 02:55:22,880
When's California Xtreme?

3543
02:55:22,880 --> 02:55:27,920
I think it's in July, aka next month.

3544
02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:31,160
Maybe we'll go to that, because I've never been to California Xtreme and I'd really like

3545
02:55:31,160 --> 02:55:32,160
to go.

3546
02:55:32,160 --> 02:55:33,160
What do you think there, Sakura?

3547
02:55:33,160 --> 02:55:34,160
Do it.

3548
02:55:34,160 --> 02:55:35,160
Think we'll make that happen in July?

3549
02:55:35,160 --> 02:55:36,160
We'll see what we can do.

3550
02:55:36,160 --> 02:55:39,640
I'm not going to make any promises yet, but July would be a lot better than June.

3551
02:55:39,640 --> 02:55:40,640
So maybe.

3552
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:45,160
Alright, well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank

3553
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:47,160
you so much for your call and have fun.

3554
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:49,160
Alright, see ya.

3555
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:50,160
Later.

3556
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:54,000
1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRady if you want to give us a

3557
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:55,000
call.

3558
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:56,480
Loki, do you have any other last minute stories for us real quick?

3559
02:55:56,480 --> 02:55:58,960
Yeah, I got some interesting things.

3560
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:05,840
There's a rumor that they're going to be doing a Street Fighter versus Tekken game.

3561
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:06,840
That's kind of interesting.

3562
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:07,840
Interesting.

3563
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:08,840
Sounds like fun.

3564
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:09,840
Yes.

3565
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:16,840
So maybe that's going to be kind of the title they're going to announce at E3, I don't know.

3566
02:56:16,840 --> 02:56:19,520
July 17th through 18th for California Xtreme.

3567
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:20,520
Let's go to the phones.

3568
02:56:20,520 --> 02:56:21,840
Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.

3569
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:22,840
Who's this?

3570
02:56:22,840 --> 02:56:24,840
Hi, this is Spazinator.

3571
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:28,600
Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

3572
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:36,440
I had one question that kind of ties in very loosely to the last call that you had.

3573
02:56:36,440 --> 02:56:37,440
Alright, but just one.

3574
02:56:37,440 --> 02:56:38,440
No, I'm just kidding.

3575
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:39,440
What's up?

3576
02:56:39,440 --> 02:56:45,920
I was kind of wondering, is there any like retro games that you would love to see either

3577
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:53,600
in Microsoft's game room or on PSN that's not already there or hasn't been announced?

3578
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:55,120
Ooh, good question.

3579
02:56:55,120 --> 02:56:59,440
I would definitely like to see PS2 somehow able to get some of my old PS, because believe

3580
02:56:59,440 --> 02:57:02,440
it or not, PS2 is getting to be, you know, when did the PS2 come out?

3581
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:03,440
About 10 years ago.

3582
02:57:03,440 --> 02:57:05,360
So it's going to be a little bit retro.

3583
02:57:05,360 --> 02:57:09,040
As far otherwise, I would say I would like to see a little bit more of the Commodore

3584
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:10,240
64 love.

3585
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:14,220
There's a little bit of that on the Wii, but we don't have enough of it, especially here

3586
02:57:14,220 --> 02:57:15,220
stateside.

3587
02:57:15,220 --> 02:57:18,660
I realize Commodore 64 was a bigger deal over in Europe, but like I would love to see stuff

3588
02:57:18,660 --> 02:57:21,600
like Impossible Mission and so forth released over here.

3589
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:26,400
And I hope that my earlier inkling, that if Game Room is going to reach thousands of games,

3590
02:57:26,400 --> 02:57:31,840
then they're going to dip into the old like Apple IIe library and the Commodore 64 library

3591
02:57:31,840 --> 02:57:32,840
and some of that.

3592
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:35,880
I hope my inkling there is correct, because there's lots of Commodore 64 games I would

3593
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:37,080
love to see get the treatment.

3594
02:57:37,080 --> 02:57:41,080
I mean, you guys should see some of the EA games back when they were ECA.

3595
02:57:41,080 --> 02:57:42,800
They made some pretty epic games.

3596
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:46,200
Mule, M-U-L-E, was a great game on the 64.

3597
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:47,680
I'd love to see make a comeback.

3598
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:52,960
You know, there's a lot of those like classic computer games of yesteryear I would love

3599
02:57:52,960 --> 02:57:53,960
to see.

3600
02:57:53,960 --> 02:57:56,200
And if that happens on PSN, that would be great too.

3601
02:57:56,200 --> 02:58:01,040
Although I sort of see the classic stuff on PSN as being more of a like Sony-based thing

3602
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:02,040
usually.

3603
02:58:02,040 --> 02:58:03,560
I don't usually see a lot of old stuff.

3604
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:04,560
But you know what's interesting?

3605
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:06,120
There has been some obscure stuff.

3606
02:58:06,120 --> 02:58:07,840
Let me give you one retro title.

3607
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:12,720
Digger HD is out on PlayStation Network, and it's kind of an overlooked title, but it's

3608
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:15,120
a remake of an old, old PC game.

3609
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:20,000
And what's really cool, the old PC game is in there and playable.

3610
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:25,200
It's not one of my favorite classic games and not one that necessarily necessitated

3611
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:31,360
the treatment it got, but I think it's an example of a retro remake done really well.

3612
02:58:31,360 --> 02:58:34,100
And that is on PlayStation Network and not on 360.

3613
02:58:34,100 --> 02:58:36,040
It's only on PSN, Digger HD.

3614
02:58:36,040 --> 02:58:37,040
It's worth a look.

3615
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,040
Oh, yeah.

3616
02:58:38,040 --> 02:58:40,040
Yeah, I got that one too.

3617
02:58:40,040 --> 02:58:44,640
In fact, I got that two I want to see roughly about a month and a half ago.

3618
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:45,640
That's pretty good.

3619
02:58:45,640 --> 02:58:46,640
Yeah.

3620
02:58:46,640 --> 02:58:48,640
I mean, it's cute for a retro game.

3621
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:49,640
Yeah.

3622
02:58:49,640 --> 02:58:50,640
Yeah.

3623
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:59,560
At least in terms of game room, what I would love to see is like virtually any old classic

3624
02:58:59,560 --> 02:59:01,560
Capcom game.

3625
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:07,440
I mean, Capcom, before they really started going gung ho on home consoles, they've been

3626
02:59:07,440 --> 02:59:15,320
known for their arcade titles, whether it be the 1940 series, the Street Fighter series

3627
02:59:15,320 --> 02:59:21,360
that's pretty much a given, Ghosts and Goblins, and so on and so forth.

3628
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:27,600
Game room badly needs other publishers on board because right now the only game room

3629
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:34,040
games that are coming out are Atari, Activision, Intellivision, and Konami.

3630
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:35,040
That's it.

3631
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:38,040
I have not seen games from, at least I can think of, off the top of my head.

3632
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:42,040
I don't believe there are any other publisher's games showing up in game room, which is odd

3633
02:59:42,040 --> 02:59:45,920
because they promised this thousand games thing earlier.

3634
02:59:45,920 --> 02:59:51,060
And what's also strange to me, this week in game room, let me take a step back.

3635
02:59:51,060 --> 02:59:57,680
Game packs like three and four in the other expansions we got were packs of 14 games split

3636
02:59:57,680 --> 02:59:59,480
into two weeks worth of releases.

3637
02:59:59,480 --> 03:00:01,440
In other words, they were timed release.

3638
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:06,040
It's like when you downloaded pack three, you got seven games one week and then seven

3639
03:00:06,040 --> 03:00:07,040
games the next.

3640
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:11,680
Well, game pack five just came out and we got five games this week, which makes me think

3641
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:13,960
it's going to be three weeks worth now.

3642
03:00:13,960 --> 03:00:18,920
They're stretching these game packs out longer and longer, like they are going to run out

3643
03:00:18,920 --> 03:00:21,200
of games.

3644
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:25,320
My hope is that they are going to make some big announcements at E3 and that's kind of

3645
03:00:25,320 --> 03:00:29,940
why we're waiting because right now, okay, well the three weeks for game pack five would

3646
03:00:29,940 --> 03:00:32,440
take us right through the end of E3.

3647
03:00:32,440 --> 03:00:34,860
There was also a delay this week.

3648
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:38,920
Game pack five was held up by a day and I don't know if maybe this all plays into it,

3649
03:00:38,920 --> 03:00:43,560
but I really hope that they are coming out at E3 and saying, hey, we have these other

3650
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:46,000
publishers on board for game room.

3651
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:52,040
If they don't do that, game room is doomed and it's really a bummer because there's so

3652
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:53,840
much potential with game room.

3653
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:57,960
Although I fired up video pinball this week, which was one of the releases.

3654
03:00:57,960 --> 03:01:00,960
Yeah, not what I remember when I was six.

3655
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:03,520
I was kind of disappointed.

3656
03:01:03,520 --> 03:01:15,200
Yeah, in fact, I had just recently bought Super Breakouts and as Bobby Blackbroker,

3657
03:01:15,200 --> 03:01:21,800
he had pointed out on his show, Without the Pail is kind of a pain in the arse to play

3658
03:01:21,800 --> 03:01:28,200
that game, but still, even with that being said, you know, there's the whole nostalgia

3659
03:01:28,200 --> 03:01:35,560
factor considering that there was, I think the first game I ever played at Syphon Blackjack

3660
03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:42,160
on the 2600, so there's something behind that.

3661
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:47,020
I think a lot of people also, when they think about the old Breakout games, they're really

3662
03:01:47,020 --> 03:01:49,520
thinking about Arkanoid.

3663
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:53,120
You might know the difference between the games, and I'm sure someone like Bobby certainly

3664
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:57,080
knows his video games and all that, but I think when a lot of us think about Breakout

3665
03:01:57,080 --> 03:02:01,960
and the retro goodness of that game, you're really remembering Arkanoid and some of the

3666
03:02:01,960 --> 03:02:07,640
better Breakout games that came out later on, and Tidal would be a good publisher to

3667
03:02:07,640 --> 03:02:08,640
buddy up with too.

3668
03:02:08,640 --> 03:02:12,280
You could get Arkanoid, Bubble Bobble, lots of good stuff.

3669
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:18,480
The next few weeks are really crucial for game room, and I've gone on this tangent in

3670
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:20,920
previous shows.

3671
03:02:20,920 --> 03:02:24,600
I'm really worried the game room is going to be a giant disappointment, and it's almost

3672
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:29,000
more disappointing because if it doesn't work, you're not going to see anyone else want to

3673
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:34,640
try it, and there was such good ideas here, but I really think those chrome layoffs affected

3674
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:38,920
things harder than they claimed it was going to, but I hope they're at E3, because I'm

3675
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:39,920
going to ask some questions.

3676
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:40,920
I can't wait.

3677
03:02:40,920 --> 03:02:41,920
Oh yeah.

3678
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:42,920
Can't wait.

3679
03:02:42,920 --> 03:02:50,440
Yeah, I really hope that despite the layoffs, they do manage to really turn out the games

3680
03:02:50,440 --> 03:02:57,480
for you, and they get all the support from the gaming community that they deserve, because

3681
03:02:57,480 --> 03:03:04,360
I just hate to have to wait another generation or two for something similar to game room.

3682
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:05,360
Let's hope.

3683
03:03:05,360 --> 03:03:06,360
Let's hope.

3684
03:03:06,360 --> 03:03:08,760
Spaznator, I got to let you go, because we're going to go and wrap up the show, but thanks

3685
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:10,760
so much as always for your call, okay?

3686
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:11,760
Sure.

3687
03:03:11,760 --> 03:03:12,880
Have a good one.

3688
03:03:12,880 --> 03:03:13,880
You too, buddy.

3689
03:03:13,880 --> 03:03:14,880
All right.

3690
03:03:14,880 --> 03:03:16,680
That's going to do it for the Skypline tonight.

3691
03:03:16,680 --> 03:03:21,600
I'm sorry to close the phones, but we're kind of running long tonight because part A was

3692
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:23,000
really, really long tonight.

3693
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:26,320
It was almost two hours long, so unfortunately I am going to close up the Skypline so we

3694
03:03:26,320 --> 03:03:28,880
can kind of wrap up the show, because we still have an afterword to get to and all that fun

3695
03:03:28,880 --> 03:03:30,720
stuff, and last minute stories.

3696
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:34,800
We haven't let Loki finish last minute stories, but I did want to invite callers, please email

3697
03:03:34,800 --> 03:03:35,800
us right now.

3698
03:03:35,800 --> 03:03:37,360
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com.

3699
03:03:37,360 --> 03:03:39,600
Get your thoughts out so we can read them on next week's show.

3700
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:40,600
Loki.

3701
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:41,600
Yes.

3702
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:42,600
Other things.

3703
03:03:42,600 --> 03:03:46,160
There was a game that I think we talked about a long time ago.

3704
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:50,740
It was a Grand Theft Auto kind of demake, I guess.

3705
03:03:50,740 --> 03:03:55,040
They were doing like an 8-bit version of it.

3706
03:03:55,040 --> 03:03:59,340
There's a guy working on like a ROM hack, or actually just kind of a custom game that

3707
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:04,240
was going to be based on, I guess, Grand Theft Auto.

3708
03:04:04,240 --> 03:04:10,840
Well, now this game is being retitled and losing all of its Grand Theft Auto ties, but

3709
03:04:10,840 --> 03:04:17,560
it's going to be coming out on WiiWare as Retro City Rampage, and it looks pretty awesome.

3710
03:04:17,560 --> 03:04:23,200
They're going to have a bunch of different parodies on different things like Metal Gear,

3711
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:27,600
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and whatnot, Sonic, and the game itself is pretty much

3712
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:33,380
an open world action game, just like the old school top down Grand Theft Autos.

3713
03:04:33,380 --> 03:04:35,360
So that's pretty sweet.

3714
03:04:35,360 --> 03:04:36,360
Interesting.

3715
03:04:36,360 --> 03:04:37,360
Yeah.

3716
03:04:37,360 --> 03:04:47,840
Apparently, some of the Nintendo portables, the DSi XL, they are getting some new colors

3717
03:04:47,840 --> 03:04:49,680
of the DSi XL.

3718
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:56,440
There's going to be yellow, blue, and green coming out in Japan, and also in time for

3719
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:59,740
all that stuff, they're going to be dropping the price as well.

3720
03:04:59,740 --> 03:05:07,040
So cutting it down from 20,000 yen to 18,000 yen, and the DSi will also drop down from

3721
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:14,480
18,900 yen to about 15,000 yen.

3722
03:05:14,480 --> 03:05:19,680
So that's kind of interesting, I guess getting ready for the 3DS.

3723
03:05:19,680 --> 03:05:21,800
That blue one is kind of pretty though, so is the green one.

3724
03:05:21,800 --> 03:05:24,320
Yellow one I could do without.

3725
03:05:24,320 --> 03:05:29,600
Then also in the UK, the DSi is getting the price drop as well.

3726
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:31,880
Could they be announcing one on stage next week?

3727
03:05:31,880 --> 03:05:32,880
Yeah, that would be my guess.

3728
03:05:32,880 --> 03:05:34,880
Could that possibly be happening?

3729
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:41,120
Yeah, and the funny thing is, these are all starting on June 18th.

3730
03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:42,120
June 18th.

3731
03:05:42,120 --> 03:05:48,560
Yeah, that doesn't coincide with something, I'm sure, if I put my mind to it.

3732
03:05:48,560 --> 03:05:55,520
And yeah, they will be dropping the price as well from 150 euros to, looks like 120

3733
03:05:55,520 --> 03:06:04,560
to 130 euros around there, so interesting.

3734
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:08,640
There's a rumor that Kim Kardashian is going to be the next Lara Croft.

3735
03:06:08,640 --> 03:06:09,640
Whatever.

3736
03:06:09,640 --> 03:06:14,080
Well, she's got the assets to be Lara Croft, but that's about it.

3737
03:06:14,080 --> 03:06:19,080
She can't act way out of a box, so I don't really care.

3738
03:06:19,080 --> 03:06:25,920
MotorStorm 3 apparently is going post-apocalyptic, and this is coming from some screens leaked

3739
03:06:25,920 --> 03:06:30,040
on the French website PS3 Gen.

3740
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:36,720
They have what they claim to be some stolen images of MotorStorm 3 showing kind of a,

3741
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:42,840
I guess, San Francisco map that has buildings crumbling and whatnot.

3742
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:49,440
To me, if this is actually real, this is kind of what fuel should have been, but I kind

3743
03:06:49,440 --> 03:06:50,440
of like that.

3744
03:06:50,440 --> 03:06:51,440
I think that'd be kind of cool.

3745
03:06:51,440 --> 03:06:54,880
I didn't really get into the last MotorStorm game, but the first one was pretty good.

3746
03:06:54,880 --> 03:06:56,240
Could be interesting.

3747
03:06:56,240 --> 03:06:58,160
I'm interested.

3748
03:06:58,160 --> 03:07:03,800
And then finally, Def Jam Rapstar is going to be coming out, I guess, this year.

3749
03:07:03,800 --> 03:07:08,200
Europe October 5th and North American November 6th.

3750
03:07:08,200 --> 03:07:14,560
The game will retail for $69.99 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and $59.99 on the Wii.

3751
03:07:14,560 --> 03:07:17,800
I'm assuming it comes with one microphone.

3752
03:07:17,800 --> 03:07:24,560
And some of the songs that have been announced for it, they've got Biz Marquee's Just a Friend,

3753
03:07:24,560 --> 03:07:31,960
Drake's Best I Ever Had, Ice Cube's with It Was a Good Day, Outkast's So Fresh, So Clean

3754
03:07:31,960 --> 03:07:40,960
by Pete Rock, and CL Smooth's The Reminisce is Over You, Troy.

3755
03:07:40,960 --> 03:07:47,840
And also Redman's and Method Man's Da Rock Wilder and Salt Peppers.

3756
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:48,840
Push it.

3757
03:07:48,840 --> 03:07:49,840
Biz Marquee.

3758
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:52,480
Push it real good.

3759
03:07:52,480 --> 03:07:59,480
They're going to have a freestyle mode as well as a couple of original instrumental

3760
03:07:59,480 --> 03:08:02,920
tracks, which I guess will tie in with the freestyle mode.

3761
03:08:02,920 --> 03:08:05,960
So, interesting.

3762
03:08:05,960 --> 03:08:06,960
Comments from our chat room.

3763
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:07,960
Chat.org.com.

3764
03:08:07,960 --> 03:08:12,320
Salacious Pop commenting on the Kim Kardashian role.

3765
03:08:12,320 --> 03:08:15,800
You can't do backflips with an Ask That Fat.

3766
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:19,080
I'm Too Good says if the second Lara Croft movie was the first one, it wouldn't have

3767
03:08:19,080 --> 03:08:20,080
bombed.

3768
03:08:20,080 --> 03:08:23,480
It wouldn't have been the first.

3769
03:08:23,480 --> 03:08:24,960
So I never saw either one.

3770
03:08:24,960 --> 03:08:25,960
I got to admit.

3771
03:08:25,960 --> 03:08:27,280
I don't watch a lot of video game movies.

3772
03:08:27,280 --> 03:08:28,460
I did see like Resident Evil.

3773
03:08:28,460 --> 03:08:30,600
Silent Hill was obviously the last one I saw.

3774
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:31,600
That's a good one.

3775
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:32,600
I want to go back and watch that again.

3776
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:36,920
I thought it was underrated by most people, but whatevs.

3777
03:08:36,920 --> 03:08:38,440
Different movies for different people, I suppose.

3778
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:39,440
All right.

3779
03:08:39,440 --> 03:08:40,440
Is that it?

3780
03:08:40,440 --> 03:08:41,440
That's it.

3781
03:08:41,440 --> 03:08:42,440
We're done.

3782
03:08:42,440 --> 03:08:43,440
We're out.

3783
03:08:43,440 --> 03:08:45,880
It's time for us to wrap up the show and say our good nights.

3784
03:08:45,880 --> 03:08:50,200
Of course, we'll be back here next week with our big pre-E3 show.

3785
03:08:50,200 --> 03:08:54,040
Some folks are asking for an OLR game the week before E3.

3786
03:08:54,040 --> 03:08:56,280
We might just have to give them what they want.

3787
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:59,440
We are the show where every gamer has a voice after all, so we'll be doing that.

3788
03:08:59,440 --> 03:09:01,940
We might be actually doing a press conference live.

3789
03:09:01,940 --> 03:09:06,120
I just have to steal the audio from another site, so we'll have to figure that out.

3790
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:09,680
If anybody knows of a site that's doing the audio live Sunday, please...

3791
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:10,680
Which one is it?

3792
03:09:10,680 --> 03:09:11,680
Microsoft?

3793
03:09:11,680 --> 03:09:12,680
The Cirque du Soleil one.

3794
03:09:12,680 --> 03:09:13,680
It's the tall one.

3795
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:14,680
It'll probably be on Xbox.com.

3796
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:15,680
Well, maybe it will be.

3797
03:09:15,680 --> 03:09:16,880
We can steal the audio.

3798
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:21,320
We'll rebroadcast it over here with our own commentary, because it's not stealing if we

3799
03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:24,140
provide a certain percentage of original content.

3800
03:09:24,140 --> 03:09:26,340
And Miklotov will be here, and we'll be talking E3.

3801
03:09:26,340 --> 03:09:29,760
It's going to be a very packed show next week, so stay tuned for that.

3802
03:09:29,760 --> 03:09:33,760
And of course, thank you guys very much for tuning into our show and downloading it, listening

3803
03:09:33,760 --> 03:09:35,200
live, however you did.

3804
03:09:35,200 --> 03:09:39,900
All we ask you guys, if you enjoy what you've heard, please tell two people about our program.

3805
03:09:39,900 --> 03:09:44,200
Help us spread the word, because we are not a big magazine or a big website.

3806
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:49,040
We are by the people, for the people, and we really only get our advertising done via

3807
03:09:49,040 --> 03:09:50,240
word of mouth.

3808
03:09:50,240 --> 03:09:51,240
That's it.

3809
03:09:51,240 --> 03:09:52,800
We don't play any advertising on the show, so that's all we ask.

3810
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:54,240
Help us advertise instead.

3811
03:09:54,240 --> 03:09:55,600
So that's it.

3812
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:59,080
We can't close out the show, though, until we go around and give everybody's final thoughts.

3813
03:09:59,080 --> 03:10:00,760
Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

3814
03:10:00,760 --> 03:10:02,480
What's your final thought, Loki?

3815
03:10:02,480 --> 03:10:04,880
My final thought is...

3816
03:10:04,880 --> 03:10:07,680
I'm going to be busy this week.

3817
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:09,440
My final thought is...

3818
03:10:09,440 --> 03:10:12,400
I want a teriyaki chicken bowl from Jack in the Box.

3819
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:14,640
That sounds really good right now.

3820
03:10:14,640 --> 03:10:19,520
Dark Soccer, what's your final thought?

3821
03:10:19,520 --> 03:10:21,160
How's that voice coming along good, huh?

3822
03:10:21,160 --> 03:10:22,160
What voice?

3823
03:10:22,160 --> 03:10:23,160
You need some WD-40.

3824
03:10:23,160 --> 03:10:24,160
All right.

3825
03:10:24,160 --> 03:10:25,260
I've got Ricola.

3826
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:27,880
Thank you guys very much for listening once again.

3827
03:10:27,880 --> 03:10:28,880
Have a wonderful week.

3828
03:10:28,880 --> 03:10:32,240
We will see you here next week for more of Orange Lounge Radio.

3829
03:10:32,240 --> 03:10:36,480

3834
