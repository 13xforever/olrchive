00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:19,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, June 6, 2010, a lawsuit is filed against Final Fantasy XIII.

2
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:25,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors say a new dance game is coming to Project Atal, and could you soon pay a new tax on your consumer electronics?

3
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:35,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

13
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:01,159
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, needing a good oiling, apparently.

14
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:09,303
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first day I've actually felt somewhat decent, so I've been sick, but I am mostly over it, a little leftover.

15
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:11,444
[SPEAKER_03]: My voice may go out during the show.

16
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:12,325
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what you need?

17
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:13,946
[SPEAKER_03]: A lozenge.

00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:16,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You need, well that, and you need salad.

00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:22,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Fresh Choice, just like Jamie.

00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:24,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw your picture.

21
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:25,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent you a tweet.

22
00:01:26,432 --> 00:01:28,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have been eating salad all weekend.

23
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:30,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an epic salad yesterday, Rob.

24
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:30,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this.

25
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:54,650
[SPEAKER_03]: and so there's different levels of salad there's like you know there's there's level one salads you're like basic house salad then there's epic salad of awesomeness my salad had used red vein chard which hard is delicious and raw squash and Roma tomatoes and dehydrated apples and

00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:00,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Pea Sprouts.

28
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:02,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Pea Shoots.

00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:02,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Pea Shoots.

30
00:02:02,953 --> 00:02:03,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And broccoli.

31
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:06,094
[SPEAKER_05]: And occasionally we do talk about video games here at Orange Lounge Radio.

32
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,555
[SPEAKER_03]: With a raspberry vinaigrette.

33
00:02:08,155 --> 00:02:10,296
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't put your video games in raspberry vinaigrette.

34
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:10,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't work anymore.

35
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:11,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that not epic?

36
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:12,237
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds pretty epic.

37
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:12,977
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good.

38
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:13,397
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

39
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:14,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have gelato today.

40
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:15,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Also here.

41
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to introduce the one and the only tech master, Loki.

42
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:18,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

43
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:19,882
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Loki?

44
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:21,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm full.

45
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:22,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You're full?

46
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:22,724
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you been eating?

47
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:23,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a salad.

48
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that.

49
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:24,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Breadsticks.

50
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:25,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Breadsticks.

51
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:26,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

52
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,408
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be like a food MMO.

53
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

54
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Sizzler, the MMO.

55
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,750
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

56
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:35,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't need that.

57
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:36,202
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

58
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:41,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at All Games Radio.

59
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:47,609
[SPEAKER_05]: www.allgames.com 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

60
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:50,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So do pull up a chair and join us in our chat room if you are listening live.

61
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:56,755
[SPEAKER_05]: chat.orangeloungeradio.com We're going to be talking video games over the next few hours tonight.

62
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:59,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of E3 rumors and kind of things...

63
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:03,280
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in that period where E3 is right around the corner.

64
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we're, what, eight days away from the first?

65
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:19,992
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, we're one week away from the first press conference, if you count the Cirque du Soleil Project Natal thing, where they're going to announce the real name of it, which I heard a little rumor, take it with a grain of salt, Xbox Wave.

66
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:21,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know.

67
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:22,754
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you feel about that as the name?

68
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You think that's a good name for a peripheral?

69
00:03:24,515 --> 00:03:25,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Wave?

70
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:25,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

71
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:27,539
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting.

72
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see them doing little title waves.

73
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's waving her hand.

74
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,802
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it's not the Xbox flail.

75
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:34,624
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I guess, a little better.

76
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,626
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be if they put Parapara on it.

77
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:38,586
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

78
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:40,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Take that with a gigantic grain of salt.

79
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a thought about the Natal thing and Parapara.

80
00:03:46,272 --> 00:03:46,592
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

81
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:47,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you imagine that?

82
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:48,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

83
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:16,653
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, the show was just kind of like a lot of it was behind closed doors.

84
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:27,481
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it was more conceptual because you had Natal and Move being announced, and I guess the vitality sensor to some extent, but nothing really being shown.

85
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:34,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this year, we're really going to see what is going to be out on the shelves this Christmas, and there's going to be a lot fighting for your attention this year.

86
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:35,346
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very interesting.

87
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:36,134
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

88
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:55,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as I was playing just a moment ago, I was playing some Portal.

89
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:00,245
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really have to owe it to a lot of Star Trek Online.

90
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:06,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I realized that I had three more ranks to go before I hit Commander.

91
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,932
[SPEAKER_03]: And damn it, I'm almost there.

92
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:11,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want that extra pip.

93
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:22,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, other than that, I also, uh, canned two of my crewmen and now have this weird purple dude, or purple chick, who just is bizarre looking, but she's got good stats, so whatever.

94
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:27,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, um, I have to say, the crystalline entity is a bitch.

95
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,259
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

96
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,419
[SPEAKER_05]: What is, what is the crystal, I don't, I'm not a big enough nerd.

97
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a next generation foe.

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

99
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:40,386
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's this big crystal thing, spiky crystal thing floating in space.

100
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the show, they used a high-pitched noise thing.

101
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they eject the warp core to fix it?

102
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,350
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

103
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's always how you fix the problem.

104
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:47,872
[SPEAKER_03]: They pretty much screamed at it.

105
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:48,452
[SPEAKER_05]: You eject the warp core.

106
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:48,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

107
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:50,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much screamed at it.

108
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:53,115
[SPEAKER_03]: They used a high-pitched harmonic or something.

109
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:55,277
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying that the purple chick is a butterface?

110
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:56,678
What?

111
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:59,860
[SPEAKER_06]: She looks strange, but she has good stats.

112
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:05,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay She has a nice body but her face, is that what it is?

113
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:12,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes Okay Whatever Anyway Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait Do you want me to find a picture of her?

114
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:18,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, no I want to ask you something Star Trek related Have you heard the commercials on the radio?

115
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:24,561
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the Star Trek tour Is apparently like right around the corner from my house McClellan

116
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not giving away where I live on the show, but that's right around the corner of my house.

117
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's like one exit up the freeway.

118
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:30,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't know.

119
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:31,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

120
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:32,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know.

121
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:33,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

122
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:33,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now you know.

123
00:06:33,885 --> 00:06:35,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the entire internet knows where I live.

124
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:37,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you lived in the butt end, the other way.

125
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:38,787
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

126
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan's in the other room singing Knowing is Half the Battle.

127
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,968
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get Dan a mic in the living room.

128
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:49,851
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get like a really long cord just so Dan can give his MST3K commentary during the show from the living room.

129
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:50,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

130
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:51,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

131
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:53,193
[SPEAKER_05]: and BurgerTime.

132
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:55,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll have some fava beans and a nice canteen.

133
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:29,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, this is an open letter of annoyance to people who play Star Trek online.

134
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,060
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, the crystalline entity thing is an open instance.

135
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,521
[SPEAKER_03]: That means anyone can join it.

136
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:40,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the most retarded of the retarded, the butt-tarded, can join this instance.

137
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:43,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not use mine!

138
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:45,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not use mines.

139
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:48,431
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that you beat the stupid thing is you eject the warp core breach.

140
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you kill it.

141
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:49,933
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

142
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:56,118
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that you kill the thing is that when you get it down to 30%, it's going to shoot out these large crystals.

143
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:57,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't shoot the fragments.

144
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:02,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot the big crystals because the big crystals go back and regenerate the damn thing and then it shoots out everything and kills you.

145
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:04,085
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do it, Captain.

146
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,626
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the power.

147
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:10,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Just people think strategy, please.

148
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody ever yell that in Star Trek Online?

149
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:13,933
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the power!

150
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:14,594
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

151
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:18,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure somewhere somebody has.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,602
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep mentioning Worf.

153
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:21,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

154
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:25,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually enjoy all the instances that involve the Klingons because they're so much fun.

155
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really enjoying the game, okay?

156
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,160
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rob, you were supposed to play with me.

157
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I will use the pass.

158
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:34,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I will.

159
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:37,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, World of Warcraft, Addict, etc.

160
00:08:37,145 --> 00:08:37,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, look.

161
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking in our chatroom.

162
00:08:38,506 --> 00:08:45,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And SSJ100Matt is saying that Tigerclaw has already found my house, apparently.

163
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:45,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

164
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's house.

165
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was it my house?

166
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:47,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

167
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:50,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because Tigerclaw is the expert in our chatroom.

168
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:53,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if we mention something, he'll have a link in five seconds.

169
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:54,118
[SPEAKER_05]: He's amazing.

170
00:08:54,398 --> 00:08:56,560
[SPEAKER_05]: His Google Foo is unmatched.

171
00:08:57,401 --> 00:09:05,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, SSJ100Matt also commenting on the date between DarkSakura and myself Rob better put out Yeah Rob

172
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:09,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, put out the credit card to pay the bill.

173
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:10,858
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'll be putting out.

174
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:11,478
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

175
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:12,439
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see.

176
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, where was there?

177
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another one I wanted to say.

178
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

179
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:21,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby Blackwolf, our old pal, buddy, friend who does the show before us here at All Games Radio, he is hatin' on split second.

180
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:25,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you listen to his show tonight, it's just an hour of split second bashing.

181
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, but it might as well have been.

182
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,488
[SPEAKER_05]: He says in his gaming week, he ejected the warp core breach that is split second.

183
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:34,370
[SPEAKER_05]: because he is not a fan, apparently, of Split Second.

184
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:43,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not played Split Second outside the demo, but maybe next week I'll have more of an opinion and I'll either eject Bobby's opinion from the Warp Core or whatever.

185
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:43,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

186
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:44,639
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

187
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I also have to say the thing that Dan's been playing because I have totally just gotten a kick out of watching him play it.

188
00:09:50,665 --> 00:09:54,248
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the other controller hooked up where I'd play it because you can play simultaneous on it.

189
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:55,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Super Mario Bros.

190
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:55,950
[SPEAKER_03]: X...

191
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of pals from All Games Radio, I noticed Derek H. from Dead Pixel Live is in our chat room.

192
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't listen to Dead Pixel Live, you're an idiot!

193
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on, what, Monday through Thursday at All Games Radio.

194
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do lots of shows.

195
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:11,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's asking a good question I want to pose to Jamie.

196
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:14,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Star Trek Online anything like you're in the show?

197
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:21,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I did tell him that it's pretty episode-like and that I love it, but I will give a little bit more of an apt description.

198
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:22,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

199
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:27,586
[SPEAKER_03]: You have... You basically talk to your commanders.

200
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:30,426
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk to them via subspace, and you get your missions.

201
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go to whatever system.

202
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's just a patrol.

203
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you think you're going to some abandoned place to look on some research that you don't know why it killed everybody.

204
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:43,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And, oh, the Romulans are there.

205
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:45,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

206
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:13,620
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, they do new episodes with new missions and everything and I think that that's pretty sweet.

207
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,244
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, it's like you're playing through seasons of the show.

208
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,245
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that is.

209
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:26,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and the other times where I'll scream at the stupid, you know, the Romulan medics are the worst because, like,

210
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate!

211
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:28,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate!

212
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:29,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot, shoot, shoot, regenerate!

213
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:35,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but they really do, you know, pay a lot of attention to canon in this, too.

214
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:39,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, now, I've been reading the books.

215
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, this is a different universe than the books.

216
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:46,799
[SPEAKER_03]: The books were written before the new movie came out, and this is incorporating the new movie into the storyline.

217
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, Romulus, go boom.

218
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Warf gets pissed off at everybody.

219
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Pissed off.

220
00:11:56,004 --> 00:12:01,128
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is a good continuation, but it says something like 20 years later.

221
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:04,670
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually run into people who were children in the series.

222
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:08,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You run into Meral Paris, and you run into Kiriyoshi O'Brien, and

223
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:09,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really neat.

224
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is like being in that universe.

225
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd, nerd.

226
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,312
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's cool.

227
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:16,952
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.

228
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:19,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to play a little more.

229
00:12:19,053 --> 00:12:22,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I only played during the beta and I wasn't totally absorbed with it.

230
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:25,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the space combat turned me off.

231
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:28,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the away team mode, but I didn't like the space combat at all.

232
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:33,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Rob, they've really, really addressed a lot of the problems with space combat.

233
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

234
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:34,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot smoother now.

235
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,483
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, too, is that once you get a little bit more used to the controls...

236
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:40,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is really fluid.

237
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you and I may have had the same problem.

238
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,357
[SPEAKER_03]: My graphics card was crap.

239
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I fixed that, though.

240
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I can run WoW at highest settings and it's purdy.

241
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then you should have no problem.

242
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:58,487
[SPEAKER_03]: When I upgraded my graphics card, a lot of my problems with control stopped because I wasn't lagging.

243
00:12:58,647 --> 00:12:59,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

244
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:11,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it would literally, now the difference between graphics card lag is that it would be stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter, stutter, and internet lag is that you'll go forward, you'll row back a few steps and you'll go forward again.

245
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's very few and far between.

246
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:19,974
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a little lag and it looks like you've gone back like a millimeter on the screen.

247
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:23,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow lag can suck when it's like seconds and seconds of lag.

248
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:29,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just everything kind of freezes in place and then everything happens in like half a second.

249
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:29,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it.

250
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:30,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was bad.

251
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, usually the game doesn't get too laggy, but when you get those lag spikes, oh man, world of hurt.

252
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,222
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I hated it.

253
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:43,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was one of the reasons that was, I like the lag in Star Trek Online a lot better than the lag in World of Warcraft.

254
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,807
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I actually don't like World of Warcraft, so that helps.

255
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:47,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried.

256
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:49,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a character to 20, Rob.

257
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:50,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

258
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:50,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one to 20.

259
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:50,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

260
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:59,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if anyone wants to play with me, just saying, my whole account name is DarkSakura.

261
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:00,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh.

262
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:05,786
[SPEAKER_03]: My character's name is Idarin, E-D-A-R-Y-N.

263
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm playing a Trill, whatever.

264
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Trills are cool.

265
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, we need a fleet.

266
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,012
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the O'Larmy fleet.

267
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:14,893
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

268
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,535
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

269
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:10,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's basically this guy's made different, you know, Mario, Super Mario games that'll have elements from Super Mario World, Super Mario 3, even the flurries from Super Mario 2 are in the level.

270
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was a very good looking game.

271
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:15,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it just looked like Super Mario World, at least the little bit I saw.

272
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:19,789
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, you know, Dan tried to show it to me in about 10 seconds, like, you gotta check this out.

273
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,613
[SPEAKER_03]: He was playing levels last night that are really reminiscent of Super Mario 3.

274
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:29,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the part that made me go, oh, neat, is that it was two players simultaneous, kind of like the new Wii game is all simultaneous.

275
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:33,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we and I haven't played it together yet, but I have to say that it's...

276
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:36,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude who made that game, well done.

277
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:37,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much well done.

278
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:41,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy it while it lasts before Nintendo sues the pants off those people.

279
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there is a big splash screen that's basically the equivalent of, please don't sue me.

280
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:47,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Nintendo.

281
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:48,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it?

282
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been around for a while.

283
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,283
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the games he has on there is the first one he ever did, which is really annoying because all you ever get is mushrooms in it.

284
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really, he did a great job.

285
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:08,134
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this one level that Dan was going through where you get the buzzy beetle shells and you have to break purple blocks with them.

286
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:10,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to get to the purple blocks and everything to unlock a door.

287
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:14,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got some definitely creative elements in it.

288
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:16,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pretty cool.

289
00:16:16,937 --> 00:16:20,418
[SPEAKER_03]: When I have some time that I'm not feeling like crap, I'll play it.

290
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:21,771
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

291
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:24,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on with our gaming weeks.

292
00:16:24,595 --> 00:16:25,436
[SPEAKER_05]: We're almost 20 minutes.

293
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:26,797
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you played a lot tonight.

294
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:28,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, most of that was Star Trek babble.

295
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:28,679
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

296
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:29,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I also still had to do a plug.

297
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:30,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

298
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:34,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's do it during housekeeping because I do want to give that plug as well.

299
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what did you... Oh, you're chowing down over there.

300
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:38,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you ready to talk about your gaming week?

301
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost done eating.

302
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:39,772
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

303
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:40,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

304
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:41,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad time.

305
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:42,635
[SPEAKER_05]: You want me to go my gaming week then?

306
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:43,511
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm ready.

307
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go.

308
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:47,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this week I played really only three things.

309
00:16:49,274 --> 00:17:02,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Dead Redemption, played a lot more System Link co-op, and the game, surprisingly, I don't know how to really put it, the System Link games, we have trouble staying in the same game.

310
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:03,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it will...

311
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,503
[SPEAKER_06]: have trouble joining a System Link game.

312
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:09,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I have never seen a game that has trouble joining a System Link game.

313
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:12,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And a System Link game means your Xbox are connected.

314
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:13,707
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not even on the internet.

315
00:17:13,747 --> 00:17:15,888
[SPEAKER_05]: You are literally connected cable to cable.

316
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:18,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just like... And you can't find the other Xbox.

317
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,110
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh, you're in your own game.

318
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to find a new game.

319
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're in your own game again.

320
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:23,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Find a new game.

321
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there he is.

322
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:30,015
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're like, we finished the mission or whatever, co-op mission, and it split us off into two different games again.

323
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:32,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, what the hell is wrong with this thing?

324
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's very buggy.

325
00:17:35,818 --> 00:17:43,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We had issues with where we were playing and we got dynamite and the Molotovs and stuff like that.

326
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:51,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And it stopped showing us the explosions and the blood splurts and also the fire.

327
00:17:52,229 --> 00:17:57,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my friend had trouble going through a gate because on our screen, the gate was open.

328
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:59,334
[SPEAKER_06]: On his screen, the gate was shut and locked.

329
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was interesting.

330
00:18:03,476 --> 00:18:05,597
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's still really fun.

331
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:17,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten to play a lot of online, because trying to join games online, at least at our work where our connection's not so great, it's near impossible to do it.

332
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:28,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just basically stick to System Link games, because at least that way, if live drops, which it does all the time on our connection there at work, it doesn't matter.

333
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:30,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of fun.

334
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:42,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also this week I went and played some Grand Theft Auto, Battle of the Gay Tony, more of the Episodes of Liberty City stuff.

335
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:44,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still playing through that.

336
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:48,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually still moving up the ranks because I haven't lost a game in a few weeks.

337
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:52,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 63 now, which is pretty cool.

338
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:58,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And really frustrating the hell out of my coworkers because they're getting pissed off now that I don't lose any games.

339
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:15,570
[SPEAKER_06]: They're saying... Because there was a guy that used to play with us named Chris Marsh and they're saying he... What I'm doing is very Marshian because he would, you know, pull off these just crazy ass kills and stuff.

340
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, in the old PSP game, Liberty City Stories...

341
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:22,333
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very glitched out.

342
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:25,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we had problems with teleporting grenades and whatever.

343
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,515
[SPEAKER_06]: But he actually got one kill one time.

344
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:31,037
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually got two kills out of one death.

345
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:38,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just ridiculous because he killed somebody and somehow they had just driven over health or something and then they got a second death.

346
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So he got two points for where he should have only gotten one.

347
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:56,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually gotten assists off of my own death, so I actually got points for me dying, which makes zero sense whatsoever, because you're not supposed to be able to do that.

348
00:19:56,455 --> 00:20:01,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not my fault, it's just the game is really glitchy, and that's just the way things are.

349
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:08,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of glitchy games, I've gone back to Earth Defense Force 2017 and I am going to beat it this time.

350
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:17,835
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually were playing some more and just going through the game and almost finished the game now.

351
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:20,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will be finishing that game hopefully soon.

352
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:23,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of had to dust it off again.

353
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:29,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually cracked my copy, but thankfully a while back, I bought the last three copies we had for $5 each.

354
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:30,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

355
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:31,710
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have spares.

356
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

357
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:35,554
[SPEAKER_05]: You should, I don't know, give one of those away as a prize.

358
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I was planning on it someday, but I cracked the copy.

359
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Endorsed by Loki Edition.

360
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:39,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

361
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet the developers would love that.

362
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:41,441
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

363
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:43,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?

364
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,914
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it as far as stuff I've played.

365
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of working on something right now.

366
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:54,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm working on a lot of things because that's just the way things work.

367
00:20:54,477 --> 00:21:01,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working on painting the baby's room, which is game-related because it's New Super Mario Bros.

368
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:01,961
[SPEAKER_06]: themed.

369
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:03,041
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be cute.

370
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:04,922
[SPEAKER_05]: You should put pictures on the LR feed.

371
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:06,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, there will be tons of pictures.

372
00:21:06,543 --> 00:21:07,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be pimped out.

373
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some of the wall decals, but we're going to paint a lot of it, but we want the wall decals for the characters and some of the other stuff.

374
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:15,208
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing Mario, you said?

375
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, new Super Mario Bros.

376
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:16,669
[SPEAKER_06]: theme.

377
00:21:17,589 --> 00:21:22,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a plan I can give you to make hampers look like the pipes.

378
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:24,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

379
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:25,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to look at that.

380
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:28,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was just going to get giant PVC and make it into a pipe, but...

381
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:32,658
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, well, it's something that I had planned because that's what Dan and I were going to do.

382
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:34,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

383
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:36,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got some other stuff from ThinkGeek.

384
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:41,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I got a, it was an open source music box.

385
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:44,905
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have it so that you can make the Super Mario Bros.

386
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:45,585
[SPEAKER_06]: theme on that.

387
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:47,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some Mario figurines.

388
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:51,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're planning on doing some question block.

389
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:54,792
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

390
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:18,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a lot of it's just going to be handmade and will be really awesome.

391
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:21,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there'll be tons of pictures for it once it does get finished.

392
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:29,859
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I'm working on right now, and this is just kind of an on a whim thing that I decided to do the other day is what...

393
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:38,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the phrasing Project $10 that EA's been using, you know, because they're charging people lots of money for stuff that should be in the games in the first place.

394
00:22:39,762 --> 00:22:42,542
[SPEAKER_06]: But I decided to come up with Project Under $100.

395
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:51,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And what Project Under $100 is, is building a working main cabinet under $100.

396
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:51,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

397
00:22:53,345 --> 00:23:16,995
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's including everything including shipping now although I'm pricing stuff out now I don't know if I can include shipping in there because it's I want to do a two-player cocktail but it might be a little difficult but basically though you know involving actually getting like an LCD monitor computer all the arcade parts and that kind of stuff under $100 it might end up being 120 we'll see

398
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:21,818
[SPEAKER_06]: After all that stuff because, like I said, I don't want the extra buttons and joystick and stuff.

399
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:26,001
[SPEAKER_06]: But so far I have the computer and the monitor for under $70.

400
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm off to a good start.

401
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:33,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cabinet itself will be funny because it will be made out of cardboard.

402
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:34,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

403
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to the U.S.

404
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:39,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Postal Service because you can get a ton of boxes from them for absolutely free.

405
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:39,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

406
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And they will ship them to you.

407
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:42,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

408
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:42,812
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

409
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:43,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

410
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:43,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

411
00:23:44,373 --> 00:24:03,982
[SPEAKER_05]: comments from our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you are listening to us at All Games Radio live on this Sunday night please join us if you're listening to us on the podcast remember you can always send us your comments via Twitter or mailbag mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com some comments from chat SSJ100Matt talking about the baby room says diapers go in the chomp chomp bin

412
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:12,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Derek H says, if he does that, I'm assuming talking about the MAME cabinet, I'm doing it.

413
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:16,152
[SPEAKER_05]: My MAME cabinet is an old laptop, a monitor, and an Xbox 360 controller.

414
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:18,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted, I could have done a lot of stuff.

415
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:19,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I've got some spare parts.

416
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:20,996
[SPEAKER_06]: This doesn't cost me anything.

417
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:30,664
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wanted it so that it can be somewhat reproducible because the problem is, though, shopping on eBay and buying used stuff, you never know what you're going to get for what price.

418
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:32,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Ideally, you get one day.

419
00:24:32,466 --> 00:24:33,026
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not ideal.

420
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:33,847
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get another day.

421
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:36,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got lucky with some of that stuff.

422
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:43,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I got a monitor for $32, an LCD monitor, 15-inch LCD monitor that has one dead pixel, but I don't give a shit.

423
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:45,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going in a cardboard cabinet, so who cares?

424
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:59,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got a computer for $35 that's basically a 1.6 gigahertz processor, which is fine for MAME, and I think a half gig of RAM, which is perfect for MAME.

425
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:00,642
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

426
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:27,285
[SPEAKER_06]: So I may have to supplement it with some other stuff, but I'm just kind of throwing around the idea.

427
00:25:27,305 --> 00:25:35,508
[SPEAKER_06]: We got this gift card from work for, ironically enough, selling Split Second, and so I'm using it for that.

428
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:41,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet Bobby would be proud to know that you got rewarded for selling extra copies of Split Second to people.

429
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, Loki.

430
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a decent game.

431
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:46,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know.

432
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,177
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anything else, Loki?

433
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:07,797
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

434
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:24,809
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

435
00:26:53,607 --> 00:27:00,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess, actually, one thing I didn't realize, it's one of those arcades that's also participating in the Save the Arcades 2 campaign.

436
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:04,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a story on that a couple weeks ago, because Arcade Infinity is also competing with this place.

437
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I gotta tell you, this place was awesome.

438
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:14,351
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a good time, and, you know, I didn't try to talk to anybody, or I wasn't like, you know, oh, yeah, I'm from Orange Lounge Radio, I want to talk...

439
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,852
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

440
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:40,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they have a black rose?

441
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:54,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember seeing it.

442
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:55,205
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a lot.

443
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:57,506
[SPEAKER_05]: They had more pinball machines than I've ever seen in an arcade.

444
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:59,086
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a lot.

445
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody asked me if they had Space Jam.

446
00:28:01,207 --> 00:28:01,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see Space Jam.

447
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:03,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see Doctor Who.

448
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:04,247
[SPEAKER_05]: That made me think of you.

449
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:05,648
[SPEAKER_05]: They had a Doctor Who table.

450
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:06,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty cool.

451
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:14,250
[SPEAKER_05]: The only complaint I have about the place is that the games are packed in so tight because the real estate there, there's not a lot of it.

452
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,591
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of brushing up against strangers and not a lot of elbow room.

453
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:20,431
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta say, I was there on a...

454
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:22,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave & Buster's got it, right?

455
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:23,052
[SPEAKER_05]: They do all sorts of theme nights.

456
00:28:47,439 --> 00:29:15,621
[SPEAKER_05]: apparently throughout the month too and they have bands that perform there and everything so yeah I had a good time so I'm surprised and one thing and Alan said the same thing and I commented on this too is that why in the hell don't they have this in San Francisco like there's nothing like it in San Francisco and you would think of all places kind of tech central you know NorCal would have something like it but sadly it does not SSJ100Matt says that there is a barcade in New York City Brooklyn to be exact you know I think I'd heard about that

457
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,522
[SPEAKER_05]: But I had not been there.

458
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:21,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Bond006 in chat says, Did you have a geek moment?

459
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:24,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did have a geek moment when I went in there and squeed.

460
00:29:24,527 --> 00:29:32,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And I watched my friend, get this guys, I know long time OLR fans will appreciate this, they had a DDR Extreme machine that I watched my friend play for only 50 cents.

461
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:33,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

462
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:34,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And no tokens.

463
00:29:34,754 --> 00:29:36,074
[SPEAKER_05]: That was another refreshing thing.

464
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:38,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything actually ran on quarters.

465
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:41,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had to have signs on the machines that say, Don't use this for your laundry, buddy.

466
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:43,239
[SPEAKER_05]: That's old school.

467
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

468
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, A++ for ground control, and I hope there's more places that spring up like it.

469
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:56,802
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as other games that I play that you don't have to be in Portland in order to access, I did play a couple of new games.

470
00:29:57,002 --> 00:30:03,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I was in Oregon, Oregon is infamous for not having sales tax, at least to those of us in California, so I loaded up on games.

471
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:05,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought four new games this week.

472
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:09,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought Blur, Split Second, Red Dead Redemption, and Alan Awake.

473
00:30:09,405 --> 00:30:10,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought all of those games.

474
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:13,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So that I could save a little bit on sales tax because I'm cheap.

475
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:16,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I bought four new video games, it wasn't that cheap.

476
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:21,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I played two of them this week because I didn't have time to do everything and I was kind of focusing.

477
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:24,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably played Blur more than any other game that I got this week.

478
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:26,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And Blur is pretty cool.

479
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:30,297
[SPEAKER_05]: It is exactly what they are marketing it as in the commercials.

480
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:32,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Mario Kart meets Burnout.

481
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:34,559
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Mario Kart for grown-ups.

482
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,881
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

483
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,422
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

484
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:26,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Things they could do better in the sequel.

485
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm pretty sure there will be a blur too.

486
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:31,315
[SPEAKER_05]: There deserves to be a blur too.

487
00:31:32,336 --> 00:31:34,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some things I would like to see them do better in the sequel.

488
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:37,219
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, my number one complaint about the game.

489
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,080
[SPEAKER_05]: The soundtrack blows.

490
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:45,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It's non-existent in some parts, and I don't really know what the music score is.

491
00:31:45,784 --> 00:32:01,732
[SPEAKER_05]: In some parts, there's a movie in the beginning that kind of had a cool song I recognized in it that was neat, and in the opening menus, there's some cool techno songs, but you would think something with that look of blur, like the neon, the kind of like...

492
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: F-Zero but not in the future look that Blur sort of has, the Burnout meets F-Zero look, you would think has some type of techno thumping soundtrack to it, right?

493
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:11,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something?

494
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:14,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Burnout had, the Burnout tracks, EA tracks.

495
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, granted, Blur is by Activision, but you would still expect there to be somewhat of a soundtrack, but it

496
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:20,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't there.

497
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:21,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't notable for me.

498
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:27,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I understand, they had this agreement apparently signed where I guess Crystal Method produced a soundtrack.

499
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:30,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just expecting something a lot more.

500
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:34,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I was tempted just to really use custom soundtracks the whole time.

501
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:38,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very disappointed in what should have been a better soundtrack.

502
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:42,417
[SPEAKER_05]: My other complaint is, believe it or not, the graphics are not...

503
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome!

504
00:32:44,602 --> 00:32:45,645
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, they're good.

505
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:47,148
[SPEAKER_05]: They're definitely next gen.

506
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,374
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a step above what you're gonna see on the Wii.

507
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,321
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wasn't, like, blown away by the graphics.

508
00:32:52,381 --> 00:32:52,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Like...

509
00:32:53,504 --> 00:33:11,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Blur has this neon thing going for it, but that neon is often mixed in many stages with Highway 50 going through Nevada, like that very brown, blah, dusty kind of theme, which I don't know what they were trying to go for with it, but it didn't make the graphics look that notable.

510
00:33:11,814 --> 00:33:15,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, the graphics were kind of comparable to Fuel, which didn't really have...

511
00:33:16,756 --> 00:33:32,895
[SPEAKER_05]: A++ graphics either so I was a little bit disappointed but in the end graphics and sound are not the only important things in a video game and the game itself is still a lot of fun and I am having fun making my way through it it is a game deserving of a sequel I'm

512
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:35,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they just put a little more polish on it next time.

513
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:38,017
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what I would hope for.

514
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments from our chatroom.

515
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:48,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com Bond006 says, Has anyone seen the underhand slap at Ninty, Nintendo, in the Blur ad at the end?

516
00:33:49,122 --> 00:33:50,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I think the Blur ad is great.

517
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:52,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really perfect for what Blur is trying to be.

518
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:53,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

519
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:56,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Deathwishing says, The graphics are better than Fuel.

520
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:57,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me.

521
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:58,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved Fuel.

522
00:33:58,967 --> 00:33:59,487
Ha ha ha.

523
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:00,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked Fuel a lot too.

524
00:34:00,968 --> 00:34:03,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Fuel was severely underrated.

525
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,713
[SPEAKER_05]: But Fuel was also... The biggest problem with Fuel is that it was too ambitious.

526
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:12,156
[SPEAKER_05]: And there wasn't enough polish because the world was too big in Fuel.

527
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:14,458
[SPEAKER_05]: That was its biggest problem.

528
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:16,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Its ambition was its own worst enemy.

529
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And to some extent, maybe that was the biggest problem with Blur is that they spent so much time on the game itself, which is...

530
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:24,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you should spend the time.

531
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

532
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:28,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of the graphics and sound I think suffered a little bit.

533
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:31,169
[SPEAKER_05]: But let me say this too because this is important.

534
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:38,013
[SPEAKER_05]: One feature that's in Blur that I think a lot of people overlook that does make it pretty awesome and may explain why the graphics take a hit.

535
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:41,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have split screen multiplayer.

536
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:44,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't just have to play this game on Xbox Live.

537
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play, like Mario Kart, two people on one screen.

538
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's...

539
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of cool.

540
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, take it with a grain of salt, I suppose.

541
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:57,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's why they had to make some concessions with the graphics and sound.

542
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:03,483
[SPEAKER_05]: The other game I played this week, Red Dead Redemption, which might surprise some of you guys who listen to this show.

543
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:11,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not usually the type of game I would play, but the reviews on it have been so stellar, and I've read such good things on it, I'm like, I have to pick this up and know what I'm missing.

544
00:35:11,504 --> 00:35:17,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest, I haven't played a whole lot of this story, because I can't stop shooting random people.

545
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:19,826
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, the minute they gave me a gun...

546
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:20,547
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

547
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:36,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody tells me.

548
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:39,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan just said the same damn thing when I walked in here.

549
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, my sister came over.

550
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:44,048
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been playing Red Dead Redemption as well because I got her a copy.

551
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:49,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And she just comes over and just can't stop laughing at what she's been doing.

552
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:59,115
[SPEAKER_06]: She says one of the things that she likes doing is lassoing a coyote and dragging it into the middle of town and then letting it go because it will attack whatever it sees.

553
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:02,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty funny.

554
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:04,658
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can tie people up, throw them on the train tracks.

555
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:05,299
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

556
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:19,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, here it is with Red Dead Redemption.

557
00:36:20,174 --> 00:36:21,996
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sandbox gaming at its finest.

558
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:22,797
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

559
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:26,220
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've ever wanted that Wild West sandbox, there you go.

560
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Grand Theft Horse.

561
00:36:27,081 --> 00:36:27,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Horse.

562
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:28,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is.

563
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:29,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same engine.

564
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:31,265
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that Rockstar engine.

565
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:31,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Rage.

566
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:32,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Rage.

567
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Their proprietary engine.

568
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:34,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And their euphoria.

569
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:37,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw says, wow, Sky is sadistic.

570
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:38,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Very uncharacteristic of you.

571
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:39,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I just...

572
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:43,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't play these games an awful lot, but when I do, it's really funny.

573
00:36:43,174 --> 00:36:44,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't take it seriously.

574
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you guys know how I feel.

575
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:49,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of you guys must be kind of like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

576
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:53,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't Rob the same guy who went off on the Saw movies and how he doesn't like them because they're too violent?

577
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:56,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, but Saw's kind of, like, realistic.

578
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, Red Dead Redemption, like, the graphics are good and all, but it's not realistic.

579
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:02,422
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

580
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:03,643
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference.

581
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:04,563
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a huge difference.

582
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:06,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't explain it.

583
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it makes me a hypocrite, well, screw you.

584
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:13,849
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt says, Rob, what would your mother say about this?

585
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:14,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob!

586
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,691
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just gross, Rob.

587
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:18,212
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom said we could call her, by the way.

588
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:18,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

589
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to do that.

590
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:20,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we should do it tonight.

591
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:20,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to say next week.

592
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:21,795
[SPEAKER_05]: We should, yeah.

593
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:26,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do it after E3 because I think the next week is the Microsoft thing.

594
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,080
[SPEAKER_05]: But definitely in the near future.

595
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: We will make that work.

596
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:35,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Kitsune says, Red Dead Redemption feels so much more fun than Grand Theft Auto 4 though.

597
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,901
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I kind of agree.

598
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:39,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what it is, Kitsune.

599
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:40,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel the same thing.

600
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:52,527
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something about it where I don't know if it's just the environment or it's just the story or I just get drawn into Red Dead Redemption a lot more than I do Grand Theft Auto 4.

601
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:53,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

602
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:57,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Deathwishing in chat says, Rob, I got mauled by 13 cougars at once.

603
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,210
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

604
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I was instantly thinking of...

605
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:03,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I was instantly thinking of Courtney Cox and Cougar Town.

606
00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:04,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just me?

607
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:07,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking of Blanche.

608
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest in peace, Blanche.

609
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:11,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

610
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:13,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I miss those old broads.

611
00:38:14,395 --> 00:38:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: But Betty White has outlasted them all.

612
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:16,936
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

613
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:17,796
[SPEAKER_05]: There can be only one.

614
00:38:18,716 --> 00:38:20,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Betty White has proved she's the HBIC.

615
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:21,358
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

616
00:38:22,418 --> 00:38:24,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's pretty much it for my gaming week.

617
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We are literally 40 minutes into the show.

618
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:27,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't touched a damn bit of news.

619
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:29,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me do some quick housekeeping, guys.

620
00:38:29,623 --> 00:38:31,784
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some new articles at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

621
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:34,546
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been some great, great retro reviews.

622
00:38:35,146 --> 00:39:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Retro rear views written in the past couple weeks RBI Baseball's got some gameplay there's a story on Metal Gear a new segment that's being done by Actdeft called Video Stumble which is kind of neat so check that out guys our website is expanding with all this kind of retro-ish content and I thought that was really cool I also uploaded some pics from my Portland trip if you want to see the picture of the Burger Time machine and the OLR initials I put those up at OrangeLandry.com so check those out

623
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:17,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to give a plug maybe I'll let Jamie plug this but she wrote a great article on our friend website I don't want to say our sister website but our BFF website we'll say that our BFF at geek-life.com tell them a little bit about what you did DarkSakura

624
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:26,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have... Actually, I have a regular panel on there every week on Tuesday that's called Geek Cube.

625
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:30,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about, you know, how to incorporate your geeky life with your work life.

626
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:33,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also write other articles.

627
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:37,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I did a review of this place called Fairytale Town for little kids.

628
00:39:38,381 --> 00:39:44,424
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also did a write-up for Orange Sounds Radio since we get a nice big plug on the website.

629
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so...

630
00:39:49,268 --> 00:39:54,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I just basically kind of did the not-so-secret origin of Orange Dolls Radio.

631
00:39:54,134 --> 00:40:03,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was a historical type of thing and kind of went through how we evolved from the show that was on the living room floor about DDR and 2DX to the show we are today.

632
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:03,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.

633
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:10,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and really it's the question, you know, we get asked it fairly often, like, how'd you come up with that name?

634
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And how'd you come up with this?

635
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:13,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And how long have you been doing this?

636
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:14,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was it like?

637
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:15,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And blah, blah, blah.

638
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:23,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a few of you who've been here since, you know, episode one, which I think are all in this room and two people in chat.

639
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:23,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

640
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:37,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but, you know, I really just wanted to go through and sort of give, you know, the little origin story, how we evolved, how we've gotten to where we are now.

641
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:42,885
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I hear DarkSakura might not be the only OLR host writing something for Geek Life.

642
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:46,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you a hint.

643
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:47,607
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not me.

644
00:40:50,027 --> 00:40:54,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just to go ahead and do the call out, we are looking for people to contribute content.

645
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:04,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Just basically go to geek-life.com and we have a little link on there for submissions so you can submit to our will.

646
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:05,154
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those kids.

647
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:18,321
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, keep a look out because, you know.

648
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:22,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, you may see a few things cross-posted.

649
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:23,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

650
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:26,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to have an interview up on the site next week.

651
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week, I hope.

652
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:28,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Interview, interview.

653
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:40,300
[SPEAKER_03]: With Jim McCann, who wrote New Avengers The Reunion and is writing the current Hawkeye Mockingbird and the Dazzler one-shot that was fabulous.

654
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Geek Life Indeed.

655
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:44,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Emphasis on geek.

656
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,865
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just a really, really cool person.

657
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:47,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like fun.

658
00:41:49,046 --> 00:41:49,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

659
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:51,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Geek-life.com The dash is important.

660
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:52,749
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens if they don't put the dash in?

661
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:53,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they get porn?

662
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

663
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:57,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek porn, could you imagine?

664
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:22,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, hey, I want to mention this too, because I got asked about this earlier tonight.

665
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:28,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a lot to say on this yet, but we were asked, apparently All Games Radio is putting together this thing called The Big Battle.

666
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:30,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was asked if we are participating.

667
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:40,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally found out about this today, but from what I understand in a nutshell, it is a bunch of the shows at All Games Radio kind of getting together.

668
00:42:40,573 --> 00:42:45,036
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of one of those things, like when you hear the idea, you're kind of like, this should have been done like two years ago.

669
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:46,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how obvious is this?

670
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And why haven't we done something like this a while ago?

671
00:42:48,678 --> 00:43:08,577
[SPEAKER_05]: but props, I don't know who is spearheading this, I think it might be DeadPixelLive, I don't know, but props to them for putting it on it's going to kind of bring the all games community together in big battles on games I can't 100% for sure confirm our participation yet, because I have to talk to DarkSakura and Loki after the show, see what we can do but

672
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:10,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wouldn't we?

673
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, really.

674
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:21,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about trying to promote the All Games Network and other shows, and I think a lot of our greatest listeners come from the cross-pollination of the shows.

675
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:26,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always said, I realize Orange Lounge Radio is not for everybody.

676
00:43:27,028 --> 00:43:30,630
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some games we just don't really talk about here on this show, like Madden.

677
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, we have a Madden story tonight, funny enough.

678
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:35,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually we don't talk a lot about the sports games like Madden.

679
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:36,313
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's other shows on the network...

680
00:43:36,733 --> 00:43:38,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, talk about that a lot.

681
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,915
[SPEAKER_05]: And they probably would go, DDR, what are those guys doing?

682
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:48,036
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you don't like us, surely there's another show on the network that caters to your interest.

683
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:49,217
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm definitely all about that.

684
00:43:49,537 --> 00:43:51,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So sure, I'm sure we're going to participate.

685
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:54,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a matter of figuring out what games we'll actually be able to play.

686
00:43:55,138 --> 00:43:56,499
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as I understand it,

687
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,460
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not just a host versus host thing.

688
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:02,883
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a listener versus listener thing.

689
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:10,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna need you, OL Army, to sign up and represent us in some of these games.

690
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:14,450
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will hopefully have more details for you on that next week.

691
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm not confirming our participation, but I'm just saying.

692
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:19,793
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably going to happen.

693
00:44:20,314 --> 00:44:20,574
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

694
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:23,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, hopefully I didn't say too much on that.

695
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:28,242
[SPEAKER_05]: But somebody asked in chat earlier, and I think the All Games folks know what's going on, so whatevs.

696
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:33,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the other thing I want to plug, E3 is coming up next week.

697
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:34,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it or not.

698
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:37,311
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 is kind of starting on a Sunday this year.

699
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:38,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not officially.

700
00:44:38,152 --> 00:44:39,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The show itself does not start on a Tuesday.

701
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:49,783
[SPEAKER_05]: But while our show is going on, did you guys know, at I think about 8 o'clock Pacific, I could have the time wrong, but that is Xbox, Microsoft's

702
00:44:50,336 --> 00:45:19,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Project Natal Cirque du Soleil show is a week from right now so we're actually going to be here we will be doing a show we may cut live to the press conference if we can get some coverage we will figure out how we can do that I don't know if it's going to be much besides a show I don't know what's all involved with that but we will try to figure that out and bring you that live next week also here live next week speaking of old school OLR an old familiar guest of the show Miklatov is going to be here because he's going to E3 with me

703
00:45:20,574 --> 00:45:23,596
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't leave until Monday night, so we will be here Sunday.

704
00:45:23,656 --> 00:45:26,097
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not going to miss any OLR because of E3.

705
00:45:26,437 --> 00:45:29,739
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, there might be bonus OLR on the feed.

706
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:45,766
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't see why myself and Miklatov and maybe Loki and DarkSakura via phone, depending on what we can do, or at least Bobby Blackwolf, I'm sure, if he's not too busy with all his appointments, will do some little mini-podcasts that will go to the feed during E3.

707
00:45:46,266 --> 00:45:46,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be fun.

708
00:45:48,187 --> 00:45:52,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I know you'll be hitting refresh on the sites non-stop Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

709
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:54,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Now here's what I'm going to be doing during the week.

710
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:58,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is sad because I'm not very productive during E3.

711
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:02,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I watch the live conferences at my desk.

712
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:04,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

713
00:46:05,175 --> 00:46:08,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I refresh on four different live feeds at once.

714
00:46:08,957 --> 00:46:11,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to be able to stream it on my iPhone.

715
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,102
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be able to.

716
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:18,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Our internet's that crappy at work, so why not?

717
00:46:19,546 --> 00:46:21,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, lots of housekeeping.

718
00:46:21,447 --> 00:46:23,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can finally get to gaming news.

719
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:24,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

720
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:25,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming news.

721
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, and Facebook.

722
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:27,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Add us on Facebook.

723
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:29,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

724
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:31,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

725
00:46:31,534 --> 00:46:32,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I named everything?

726
00:46:32,495 --> 00:46:33,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have.

727
00:46:33,655 --> 00:46:36,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into the freaking show already.

728
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:38,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what is going on in gaming news?

729
00:46:39,056 --> 00:46:42,478
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I guess I could take time off during E3, too, because I do have a lot of time off.

730
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:45,559
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have just gone to the... Well, you got your wife and the baby.

731
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:47,220
[SPEAKER_05]: She would not let me go to E3.

732
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,441
[SPEAKER_06]: She's having nightmares about me going to E3.

733
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:53,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not nightmares, but dreams of which she is mad at me afterwards.

734
00:46:53,963 --> 00:46:54,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

735
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:54,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well.

736
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:55,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next year.

737
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:57,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, next... Well... Maybe not.

738
00:46:58,145 --> 00:46:59,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe in three years.

739
00:46:59,626 --> 00:46:59,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.

740
00:47:02,678 --> 00:47:28,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, there's a rumor going around that Harmonix is working on a dancing game for Natal And this is becoming, I guess, obvious due to some licenses that they are acquiring for different danceable tracks Including Cascadas, Evacuate the Dance Floor, Timberlands, The Way I Are Wait a minute, this came up a couple weeks ago, I think, some of these licensing things So now we've got clarity to what it's being used for?

741
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're just guessing, I think, based on the fact that it's danceable music.

742
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:34,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping for a DJ game.

743
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:36,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that Timbaland thing coming up before.

744
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:39,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think some of this is just... But I don't remember Cascada.

745
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:40,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have remembered something like that.

746
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:41,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

747
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:55,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and they're not really saying... This is coming also from Game Informer, the rumor that they're working on a dancing game.

748
00:47:55,295 --> 00:47:58,516
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, it makes sense if you think about it, because what game...

749
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:03,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Last Fall was just incredibly popular.

750
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:09,465
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think it's still popular now that I would have never pegged to be at the top of some of these selling lists.

751
00:48:09,946 --> 00:48:15,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be Just Dance from Ubisoft, which is basically a game where you dance around to cues on the screen.

752
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:20,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And it makes sense that you would use this for Natal or something.

753
00:48:22,105 --> 00:48:22,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

754
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:24,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not a big surprise to me.

755
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:33,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure with Natal and probably the same with the move, you're going to see lots of these really gimmicky things that we have had forever.

756
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:38,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I mean, Loki, to be fair, that gimmicky game is kind of the roots of our show.

757
00:48:38,775 --> 00:48:40,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, DDR was a bit of a gimmicky game.

758
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand.

759
00:48:41,277 --> 00:48:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I get that, Loki, but here's the place where I have a little more hope than I do with all the rest of that, is the fact that Harmonix is rumored to be tied into this.

760
00:48:47,601 --> 00:48:47,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix...

761
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:11,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think here, have they ever made a bad music game?

762
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a straight up bad music game.

763
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:15,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of one.

764
00:49:15,616 --> 00:49:19,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the chatters will jump in, but Harmonix makes pretty good games.

765
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:28,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the first Guitar Hero was revolutionary, and so the second one was good too, and then they jumped ship and made Rock Band.

766
00:49:28,923 --> 00:49:31,744
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't have anything to do with the third thereafter, remember that?

767
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:33,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, Harmonix...

768
00:49:34,285 --> 00:49:36,527
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that they're involved gives me a little more hope.

769
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:41,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you think about it, Rock Band 3, I mean, how much more programming is Rock Band 3 going to take?

770
00:49:41,691 --> 00:49:49,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's probably just the Beatles and Green Day Engine souped up a little more with the keyboard, whatever's put in, a little more something, something there.

771
00:49:49,877 --> 00:49:52,458
[SPEAKER_05]: There's probably something else being cooked up over there.

772
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:55,240
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes perfect sense that this would be it.

773
00:49:56,302 --> 00:49:59,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's to say that it's not necessarily a game like DDR?

774
00:49:59,808 --> 00:50:08,222
[SPEAKER_05]: If Natal is supposed to be this magic thing that knows where you are in the room, it could work just like DDR with no dance pad.

775
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,510
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to look weird if it works like, I don't know.

776
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just going to be just like Just Dance.

777
00:50:17,772 --> 00:50:22,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's probably not going to be any more elaborate than that.

778
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:27,177
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just be interesting because you'll be able to do multiplayer and that kind of stuff.

779
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:34,201
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be more accurate because it's using a camera instead of just sensors and a close approximation of whatever you're doing.

780
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:41,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the joke is that these are actually tracks for Rock Band 3 because Rock Band 3 will also be incorporating dancers.

781
00:50:42,854 --> 00:50:44,655
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe they're working on a DJ game.

782
00:50:45,795 --> 00:50:46,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

783
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they never said anything.

784
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,496
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just saying, oh, it's going to be a Natal-based dance game.

785
00:50:51,196 --> 00:51:00,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if they're just guessing because, you know, Natal coming out soon and the fact that those types of games have done well in the past and also because these are danceable tracks.

786
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:04,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a lot of speculation going on unless they know something that we don't, but...

787
00:51:07,236 --> 00:51:12,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Being the expert analyst that I am, I'm sure it'll be something gimmicky.

788
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:16,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Miklatov is actually in our chatroom tonight, and he says, Rock Band Unplugged sucked.

789
00:51:17,443 --> 00:51:20,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, opinion is relative or whatever, but I actually disagree.

790
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:28,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Rock Band Unplugged, it wasn't Rock Band, it was Frequency Amplitude PSP with rock songs, but I didn't think it was bad at all.

791
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,712
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, the really cool thing about that game, remember, it was totally free.

792
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:34,334
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo would work with the download songs, remember that?

793
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:35,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

794
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:35,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

795
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:39,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's thinking Dance Maniacs.

796
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:57,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be honest, I hope not.

797
00:51:58,098 --> 00:52:04,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, don't get me wrong, I like Dance Maniacs for what it was, but it's a little bit gimmicky, and I think it's a $60 game.

798
00:52:04,347 --> 00:52:05,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The technology's old.

799
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:07,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't see it.

800
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:16,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And the technology's old and they're not going to do anything like that anymore because now you can do full dancing games because they have all these fun sensors that they can use.

801
00:52:16,328 --> 00:52:20,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't they do better things with a Dance Maniacs style soundtrack?

802
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what we should be looking for.

803
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:26,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we, especially as music game fans, I mean, OLR's been on for, what, eight years?

804
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:27,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And DDR was started in 1998?

805
00:52:28,074 --> 00:52:33,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've really got to start looking forward, not trying to emulate what's happened in the past.

806
00:52:34,156 --> 00:52:36,838
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where Konami is failing miserably, by the way.

807
00:52:37,578 --> 00:52:54,367
[SPEAKER_05]: what happened to DDR out of Konami I mean I don't want to spoil a story that's coming up later in the show but we're going to be talking about the games that are going to be shown at E3 this year I noticed DDR was not on the list from Konami I'm starting to wonder if that project was cancelled enter Harmonix just like they did with Guitar Hero

808
00:52:56,683 --> 00:52:58,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Time to start looking forward with our music game.

809
00:52:58,344 --> 00:53:01,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't understand how they can screw that up so much.

810
00:53:01,685 --> 00:53:09,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the problem, I think, with DDR is they need new blood in the game, basically.

811
00:53:09,067 --> 00:53:17,469
[SPEAKER_06]: They need someone like myself to come in and just completely overhaul the damn game because what they're doing now, it's just not working.

812
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they need...

813
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:22,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back to square one.

814
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:32,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe game companies, and maybe I'm giving this with too few examples, but maybe game companies are finally kind of starting to listen to what the fans want a little bit.

815
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:36,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Harmonix is like, gosh, the DDR fans kind of want something new.

816
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:36,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

817
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:38,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like the Blur people were like, gee...

818
00:53:39,953 --> 00:53:41,815
[SPEAKER_05]: People want a burnout Mario Kart game.

819
00:53:41,915 --> 00:53:42,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.

820
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:43,456
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I don't know.

821
00:53:43,476 --> 00:53:43,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's just me.

822
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:47,360
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like there seems to be a lot more fan service.

823
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:55,387
[SPEAKER_05]: You're hearing a lot more, too, about like old ass games coming back from the dead on the iPhone or on DS.

824
00:53:55,487 --> 00:53:56,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've seen that a lot lately.

825
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:57,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

826
00:53:57,589 --> 00:53:58,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless it's Earthbound.

827
00:53:58,830 --> 00:53:59,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, by the way, Earthbound.

828
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:14,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It's smart that they do listen to their fans, the people that are buying their games, to make stuff that they intend on purchasing instead of, you know, oh, I don't know, let's recreate Karaoke Revolution again.

829
00:54:16,232 --> 00:54:27,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that because now instead of calling it Karaoke Revolution 4 or whatever the hell number they were up to, oh, they're just going to re-release this or release a new game called Karaoke Revolution and it's not going to be very different.

830
00:54:28,063 --> 00:54:32,347
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to have had all this support with download content, but that never happened.

831
00:54:32,548 --> 00:54:39,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just can't buy what Konami's selling nowadays.

832
00:54:40,353 --> 00:54:40,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

833
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:41,274
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

834
00:54:41,475 --> 00:54:43,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, E3 could surprise us.

835
00:54:43,658 --> 00:54:50,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the Castlevania because apparently that Castlevania game, the multiplayer one, you know, is really legit and it should be super awesome.

836
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:57,528
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, the Silent Hill game got some good feedback on the Wii.

837
00:54:57,568 --> 00:55:06,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's got some hype points, but there's just, unfortunately, for those of us that liked a certain aspect of what they were doing many years ago, that is no longer one of their hype points.

838
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:11,175
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to bring the Silent Hill and the Metal Gear Solid arcade games to the Wii.

839
00:55:12,096 --> 00:55:15,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, actually, now you can bring them out to the PS3 and the Xbox 360, because...

840
00:55:16,758 --> 00:55:17,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome.

841
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:18,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a cue from Sega.

842
00:55:18,961 --> 00:55:20,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at House of Dead 2 and 3.

843
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:21,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome games, sold well.

844
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a cue from that company who's doing The Rock of the Dead.

845
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even cooler.

846
00:55:28,015 --> 00:55:34,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I take offense to Capcom making Marvel vs. Capcom 3 I enjoyed 10 years of utter arrogance in telling my friends there will never be Marvel vs. Capcom 3

847
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:56,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Four words, never say never ever

848
00:56:05,419 --> 00:56:07,020
[SPEAKER_05]: If DC and Marvel can hook up, anything's possible.

849
00:56:30,171 --> 00:56:31,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Bionic Commando Rearmed.

850
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:32,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say.

851
00:56:32,912 --> 00:56:34,072
[SPEAKER_05]: That was awesome.

852
00:56:34,573 --> 00:56:37,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Sin and Punishment Sky Successor from Rei Ayanami in chat.

853
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:38,034
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

854
00:56:38,134 --> 00:56:48,538
[SPEAKER_06]: That Sin and Punishment game's all... And you know what's sad about that is it's not going to sell well and it's going to be considered probably a failure on Nintendo's part and you won't see that many games like that.

855
00:56:48,558 --> 00:56:49,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Big words, Loki.

856
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:52,039
[SPEAKER_05]: What's to say that?

857
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:52,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Why you say that?

858
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:57,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Because every single mature or niche game on the Wii has not sold well.

859
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:28,156
[SPEAKER_05]: all of them think about this topic for next week I don't want to get into it tonight because we're running a little long anyway but just think about this topic for next week and write it down mentally in case I forget because I want to go through the different three press conferences and I want to kind of ask this question and maybe this is a good email topic too if those of you guys want to email us this week mailbagorangeandre.com because we're going to talk a lot pre E3 next week what could the big three do Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft at their press conferences to make you a rabid fanboy all over again

860
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Silly answers are fine, but give me some serious ones too.

861
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:36,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you right now what Sony's got to do, and it's so simple, it's so obvious.

862
00:57:36,945 --> 00:57:39,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright, but now I want to change topics because I don't want to ruin next week.

863
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:46,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel really bad for not knowing the guy's name, but the guy that they have in their commercials right now needs to be running that damn conference.

864
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:48,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

865
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:49,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

866
00:57:49,683 --> 00:57:50,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

867
00:57:50,104 --> 00:57:54,869
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the best marketing campaign ever for Sony.

868
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:56,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I would actually agree.

869
00:57:57,111 --> 00:58:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: For a company that's had lots of missteps, lots of missteps, remember the black and white PSP?

870
00:58:03,819 --> 00:58:04,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, remember that?

871
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:04,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

872
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the God of War lamb being served up?

873
00:58:07,663 --> 00:58:07,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

874
00:58:08,644 --> 00:58:09,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember the crane, baby?

875
00:58:10,046 --> 00:58:10,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

876
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:13,587
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a direction they should stick with.

877
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:14,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you that.

878
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:15,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally agree.

879
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:17,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that guy will be at E3.

880
00:58:17,432 --> 00:58:19,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Kevin Butler, I think, was his name or whatever.

881
00:58:20,235 --> 00:58:21,517
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll be there.

882
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:25,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And our chat is lighting up.

883
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin Butler, he's great.

884
00:58:26,801 --> 00:58:28,042
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the man, says Blaze.

885
00:58:28,562 --> 00:58:29,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf says he's an actor.

886
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:30,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope he does the intro.

887
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:31,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

888
00:58:31,904 --> 00:58:32,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope he's there.

889
00:58:33,445 --> 00:58:34,106
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

890
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:35,587
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on, though, guys.

891
00:58:35,627 --> 00:58:36,247
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk a little more.

892
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:38,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope he's in every press conference.

893
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's one of the rumors about what's going to be seen.

894
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:45,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Big, big, fat rumor, but it's kind of one of those rumors you look at and go, okay, I could see that.

895
00:58:46,394 --> 00:58:52,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Hulu is being teased as a possible addition to the Xbox 360.

896
00:58:52,518 --> 00:58:56,140
[SPEAKER_05]: This is coming from Gear Live, which is a tech site.

897
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, they have picked up on a rumor that Hulu's streaming functionality is going to be in the Xbox 360.

898
00:59:01,943 --> 00:59:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be announced at E3.

899
00:59:04,465 --> 00:59:11,409
[SPEAKER_05]: 1Up ran with the same rumor, saying that a Hulu application for the Xbox 360 definitely exists, but the problem right now...

900
00:59:11,909 --> 00:59:14,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tied up with rights issues.

901
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wants a piece of the rights to the application.

902
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:20,614
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?

903
00:59:20,734 --> 00:59:21,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Hulu on the 360.

904
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:24,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, for those of you that don't know Hulu, Hulu's a website.

905
00:59:24,996 --> 00:59:26,237
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of launched to say...

906
00:59:27,177 --> 00:59:27,798
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is that?

907
00:59:50,094 --> 00:59:51,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's awesome that it's there.

908
00:59:51,975 --> 00:59:56,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, prepare to be disappointed by the cliffhanger ending because the show got canceled midway through.

909
00:59:57,276 --> 01:00:01,518
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff like that that I think would be a great addition to the Xbox 360.

910
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:02,458
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?

911
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:03,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Fact or crap?

912
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:04,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Hulu on the 360.

913
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:06,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it definitely could happen.

914
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:07,440
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.

915
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it could happen.

916
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:14,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Going off the old standby that all rumors are in fact true, I could see it happening too.

917
01:00:15,163 --> 01:00:17,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a good alternative to Netflix.

918
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:23,489
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing I didn't like though is they were saying that they were going to possibly charge more money to access Hulu on the 360.

919
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:35,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, if that's the case, that's retarded because, I mean, if you just use your PC and stream your PC to your 360, you can watch Hulu for free.

920
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So why should I have to pay extra money?

921
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:40,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Bochikawa in our chat says, yeah, all the consoles have internets.

922
01:00:40,783 --> 01:00:42,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Why couldn't you watch them on it already?

923
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:45,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't believe... They block it.

924
01:00:45,627 --> 01:00:47,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's blocked on the PS3, right?

925
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:50,110
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't think the Wii has a high enough flash version.

926
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,492
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Xbox 360, don't forget, it's missing a web browser.

927
01:00:53,072 --> 01:00:55,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people think, just assume, oh yeah, I can surf the web on my 360.

928
01:00:56,115 --> 01:00:57,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you can't.

929
01:00:58,076 --> 01:01:01,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense why they don't do that, because there's already enough holes in their security.

930
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:02,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

931
01:01:04,181 --> 01:01:28,118
[SPEAKER_05]: and Wyland in our chatroom says if you want Dark Shadows watch the original 1245 episodes bring them to Hulu and maybe I'll start although from what I understand you don't really start watching Dark Shadows until about episode 75 or whenever Barnabas is finally actually first introduced you can just kind of skip the first few that's what I'm understanding anyway but I could be wrong alright

932
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:40,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, so it sounds like it could be a fact we will find out in a week Because if it's not announced at E3 then it's not coming this year, that's for sure DarkSakura, what you got for us?

933
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:53,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is more Xbox news, but basically, Robbie Bach, who is the entertainment dude, is retiring.

934
01:01:54,436 --> 01:01:58,277
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a memo that went out that said that he is retiring.

935
01:01:58,777 --> 01:02:00,298
[SPEAKER_03]: The memo was out by Steve Ballmer.

936
01:02:01,038 --> 01:02:06,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Jay Allard is going to be retiring as well.

937
01:02:08,052 --> 01:02:16,219
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta wonder if that means like retiring, like the little quotes there, like retiring, or having their butt pushed out the door.

938
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:18,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, there's always that kind of like, hmm.

939
01:02:19,101 --> 01:02:22,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, it's not like, I don't think Jay Allard is 65.

940
01:02:22,183 --> 01:02:23,564
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not quite of that retirement age yet.

941
01:02:23,584 --> 01:02:27,888
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've just been there for a while and basically Xbox is printing money.

942
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, weren't they tied to a failure that Xbox had?

943
01:02:33,772 --> 01:02:34,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there something?

944
01:02:35,232 --> 01:02:40,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Xbox, I take it that Microsoft was supposed to launch, was it a tablet computer or something?

945
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:41,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.

946
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:49,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that didn't do, and I'm sure someone in chat will jump in, that didn't, I don't think ended up happening at all, and now it's everybody's iPad, iPad, iPad.

947
01:02:49,617 --> 01:02:51,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, it's just not going to happen there at Microsoft.

948
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there it is.

949
01:02:54,139 --> 01:02:56,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how they thought they could compete with Apple over that.

950
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:11,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our people in our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Guest 9595, I wish you'd change their name so I could give them proper credit, but Guest 9595 says, Hey, can't you watch Hulu and stuff with PlayOn for any of the systems?

951
01:03:11,732 --> 01:03:15,937
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, that little software that lets you transfer your...

952
01:03:17,959 --> 01:03:19,400
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff over to the TV, right?

953
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:21,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, there's that.

954
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:23,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer diversity.

955
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:25,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can stream Hulu.

956
01:03:25,405 --> 01:03:28,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I use my PS3 to do that, and that works really well.

957
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:34,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it works just the same on a 360, but yeah, you can do that, and that's what I'm saying.

958
01:03:35,233 --> 01:03:36,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should I pay the extra?

959
01:03:36,474 --> 01:03:40,277
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing I'm guessing is it's going to be HD streaming, maybe, and you're going to get...

960
01:03:41,758 --> 01:03:48,943
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the rumors was they're going to start charging for Hulu if you want to watch some of the archive episodes.

961
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:55,687
[SPEAKER_06]: The recent episodes will be free, but the stuff past the first or second... Well, that's at the website now, isn't it?

962
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: You can watch the last five episodes of Glee, but if you want to watch anything older than that, you can't.

963
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:02,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but they're going to allow you to, but you're going to have to bill the pay.

964
01:04:04,153 --> 01:04:05,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Good thing I don't want to watch any episodes of that.

965
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:07,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're missing out.

966
01:04:09,377 --> 01:04:11,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how Sue sees it.

967
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:12,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm?

968
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:13,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe?

969
01:04:43,737 --> 01:05:03,301
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I'm just, and we're going to get into some Project $10 stuff soon, but just to kind of talk about it, I'm mad at the idea of it, and the reason I'm mad at the idea is not necessarily that it affects me, it affects a lot of other people, because me personally, I either buy new games or I don't buy the games.

970
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:06,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily that I wouldn't buy used games, but

971
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:19,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if there's a game that I don't think I'm going to be playing, I probably won't pick it up just because I know myself and I know that if I buy a game that I'm not so hot on, I won't end up playing it.

972
01:05:20,568 --> 01:05:22,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just be sitting collecting dust.

973
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for me, it's not such a big deal.

974
01:05:26,893 --> 01:05:35,420
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if you just let one thing slide, then it's just going to be a whole mess of crap that's going to come out later on.

975
01:05:36,081 --> 01:05:36,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

976
01:05:37,742 --> 01:05:43,466
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm kind of pissed off that EA is doing the whole Project $10 thing and then now THQ is following suit with that.

977
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:48,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I rumored last week, Microsoft will be probably following suit with that as well.

978
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:52,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And if Microsoft does it, then we'll have other people doing it.

979
01:05:53,434 --> 01:05:53,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

980
01:05:53,854 --> 01:05:54,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

981
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:55,475
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to talk more Project $10.

982
01:05:55,615 --> 01:05:57,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else is going to join in?

983
01:05:57,817 --> 01:06:04,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega is considering joining some sort of online pass system.

984
01:06:04,742 --> 01:06:06,103
[SPEAKER_06]: This is me scolding Sega.

985
01:06:06,744 --> 01:06:07,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega!

986
01:06:08,903 --> 01:06:21,210
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, basically Ubisoft is also kind of liking the idea and Sega is saying, you know, it's a very clever idea and they're certainly taking looks to see what happens with it.

987
01:06:21,931 --> 01:06:34,638
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're saying, of course, you know, that they want to be careful to make sure that, you know, the EA, you know, sports thing that they're doing right now actually works out and, you know, the backlash isn't too big and,

988
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:40,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it ends up working out for them, then perhaps they will allow you to... They will do something very similar.

989
01:06:42,444 --> 01:06:49,530
[SPEAKER_06]: What's kind of funny, though, is we were talking about the whole online pass thing and the Project $10 stuff with EA.

990
01:06:50,051 --> 01:07:00,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the theories was they wanted to kind of put this out there so that they can make some money from used sales and also it may curb a little bit of the piracy because the fact that if you...

991
01:07:02,401 --> 01:07:02,723
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

992
01:07:09,409 --> 01:07:10,289
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be one reason.

993
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:25,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But then EA's, I guess, UK general manager, Keith Ramsdale, basically made a comment and said, no, actually the Project $10 online pass are not about that.

994
01:07:26,596 --> 01:07:29,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the customer and improving their experience.

995
01:07:30,238 --> 01:07:35,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It's simply not a defensive measure against pre-owned or piracy.

996
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

997
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:39,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, my bullshit meter was going off.

998
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:46,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... If that isn't a bunch of corporate speak.

999
01:07:46,783 --> 01:07:49,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Improving the customer experience through... Come on.

1000
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:51,004
[SPEAKER_06]: That's retarded, then.

1001
01:07:51,164 --> 01:07:55,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather they come out and say, yeah, it's actually the curb piracy and used sales.

1002
01:07:56,325 --> 01:08:06,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now the fact that you're saying no, it's actually just to make your online play even better, but the online play isn't changing, then that just means, no, you're actually just grabbing at money.

1003
01:08:06,807 --> 01:08:13,214
[SPEAKER_06]: at least, you know, give it the, you know, excuse that, oh, we're actually just trying to make some money off of used sales.

1004
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:15,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, don't even bother with the used sales.

1005
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Just say you're just using it to combat piracy.

1006
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:20,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because everybody is like, oh, okay, piracy, that makes sense.

1007
01:08:21,302 --> 01:08:21,943
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, I...

1008
01:08:23,985 --> 01:08:27,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I don't play a lot of EA games.

1009
01:08:27,806 --> 01:08:29,667
[SPEAKER_06]: At least not the sports stuff.

1010
01:08:31,027 --> 01:08:38,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing, just looking at this stuff, that Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11, when it's coming out on Tuesday here...

1011
01:08:38,576 --> 01:08:44,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing that the online play is not going to be that different from Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10.

1012
01:08:44,438 --> 01:08:46,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And by all means, people should really look into that.

1013
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:56,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if this is their claim that, oh, we're doing this to the benefit of, you know, our consumers, then you need to look at... I think you should write a comparison for OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1014
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:59,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to play Tiger Woods 10 or 11.

1015
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:00,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Scour on the internet.

1016
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:03,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you need access to games through your job or something?

1017
01:09:06,348 --> 01:09:06,489
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1018
01:09:06,869 --> 01:09:13,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So they need to look at X and XI to see, okay, was X the latency better in XI?

1019
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:16,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the options better in XI?

1020
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:20,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And all this stuff, because I bet you if you look at that,

1021
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:21,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.

1022
01:09:21,746 --> 01:09:24,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you it's the same damn shit all over again.

1023
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:31,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really doesn't make any sense that they're charging people they're buying used for these games because they've already gotten the money for these games.

1024
01:09:31,853 --> 01:09:34,194
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason they need more money for these games.

1025
01:09:34,775 --> 01:09:40,199
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not adding more users to the online because this is still one copy of a game that's floating around out there.

1026
01:09:40,519 --> 01:09:41,540
[SPEAKER_06]: You've already made your money.

1027
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:48,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you can't run your infrastructure on the money they've made on new games...

1028
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:50,426
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't make any sense.

1029
01:09:50,446 --> 01:10:02,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what if, which is, it's not going to happen, but what if, you know, say, you know, this whole online pass thing ends up flopping and you're not making any money for, you know, the online games.

1030
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:06,572
[SPEAKER_06]: People aren't paying to play online more than that seven-day trial.

1031
01:10:07,533 --> 01:10:08,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Then nothing changes.

1032
01:10:08,653 --> 01:10:09,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Then nothing changes.

1033
01:10:09,614 --> 01:10:15,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because that's not going to motivate them to get rid of it because they're still going to make money off new games.

1034
01:10:15,316 --> 01:10:15,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1035
01:10:15,896 --> 01:10:20,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think about it, though, what are they hoping to accomplish by this?

1036
01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:30,724
[SPEAKER_06]: They're hoping that people either buy the game new or they're going to basically hope that they pay the $10 or whatever, $5 to actually play online.

1037
01:10:31,184 --> 01:10:35,947
[SPEAKER_06]: But if people don't pay that and they don't receive enough revenue, then guess what?

1038
01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:38,708
[SPEAKER_06]: The online experience doesn't change at all.

1039
01:10:39,188 --> 01:10:42,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically making their whole point, you know,

1040
01:10:44,504 --> 01:11:12,999
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, nonsense because if they're not making money from this extra use sales and using it to improve their service then they're full of shit alright let's move on with another story because this is like three weeks in a row we've talked about this stupid thing it's because it's dumb I know, I know something new is coming up every week and sadly we're probably going to hear even more about it at E3 and what other companies are going to jump on board yippee yippee

1041
01:11:14,039 --> 01:11:26,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things that are full of bullshit, somebody has filed a lawsuit against Sony and Square Enix because Final Fantasy XIII caused severe and widespread damage to PlayStation 3 consoles.

1042
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:29,152
[SPEAKER_05]: It was filed by Daniel Wolff.

1043
01:11:29,232 --> 01:11:32,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a class action lawsuit, meaning if he wins, you'll all get a piece of this.

1044
01:11:33,215 --> 01:11:46,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Wolf reckons that it freezes PlayStation 3s and when you play this, you can get your PS3 console to become totally and permanently inoperable.

1045
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:55,101
[SPEAKER_05]: The lawsuit says both defendants are eminently aware of the damage being caused by their defective products and have chosen to do nothing about it.

1046
01:11:56,001 --> 01:12:01,724
[SPEAKER_05]: They're being sued, I guess, for over $5 million in damages and relief is being sought.

1047
01:12:01,824 --> 01:12:09,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning that if you are affected by you having both of these things, you could get your very own coupon for $5 in the mail.

1048
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:11,129
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll probably be the piece of this that you're entitled to.

1049
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:13,550
[SPEAKER_05]: That's usually what happens with these class action lawsuits.

1050
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:15,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1051
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

1052
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make any sense because it's not widespread.

1053
01:12:18,772 --> 01:12:19,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1054
01:12:19,672 --> 01:12:24,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Xbox ever have to settle for the Red Rings of Death thing?

1055
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:28,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in my opinion, that was a much bigger problem.

1056
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:32,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's why they extended the warranty to three years, I thought.

1057
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:34,537
[SPEAKER_06]: But I could be wrong.

1058
01:12:34,577 --> 01:12:37,198
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't matter because this isn't widespread.

1059
01:12:38,513 --> 01:12:41,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are your data on this?

1060
01:12:41,855 --> 01:12:43,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, where is the data?

1061
01:12:43,096 --> 01:12:47,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, because... Rob, you own Final Fantasy XIII on the PS3.

1062
01:12:47,819 --> 01:12:50,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your PS3 inoperable because of Final Fantasy XIII?

1063
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:52,843
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but there was that one day.

1064
01:12:53,663 --> 01:12:56,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what, March 1st or whatever, when all the clocks were fucked up?

1065
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:56,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

1066
01:12:58,747 --> 01:13:01,909
[SPEAKER_06]: But that wouldn't be because of Final Fantasy XIII, since it came out after that.

1067
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:03,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1068
01:13:04,907 --> 01:13:06,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

1069
01:13:06,809 --> 01:13:10,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that that would be hard to prove in the first place.

1070
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:17,257
[SPEAKER_06]: That there is widespread damage because it's like a dude, you know, saying, oh, my system crashed.

1071
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:23,963
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, just randomly asking this question, how many of you remember the one day that the PS3s were down?

1072
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:25,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I bet most of you forgot.

1073
01:13:26,064 --> 01:13:28,006
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was only about three months ago.

1074
01:13:29,307 --> 01:13:29,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

1075
01:13:31,268 --> 01:13:32,509
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was that, remember that one day?

1076
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:33,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember that one day.

1077
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:43,132
[SPEAKER_06]: We should do that every week.

1078
01:13:43,192 --> 01:13:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have like, hey, you know, in case you forgot.

1079
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:48,313
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a statement called never forget.

1080
01:13:48,353 --> 01:13:49,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1081
01:13:52,354 --> 01:13:53,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Never forget.

1082
01:13:54,114 --> 01:13:56,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that time that Namco's really pissed off at us?

1083
01:13:56,895 --> 01:13:57,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Never forget.

1084
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:02,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like it, man.

1085
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,171
[SPEAKER_06]: We're full of ideas this month.

1086
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

1087
01:14:06,032 --> 01:14:08,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that should be a segment that we do regularly.

1088
01:14:08,913 --> 01:14:09,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1089
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:10,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Never.

1090
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:12,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be never forget.

1091
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:13,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1092
01:14:13,535 --> 01:14:14,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1093
01:14:14,415 --> 01:14:16,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Or no, we should do that on the website.

1094
01:14:16,556 --> 01:14:17,056
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1095
01:14:17,517 --> 01:14:20,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that is a wonderful idea for a series of articles.

1096
01:14:21,438 --> 01:14:24,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there an OLR fan that maybe wants to pick that up?

1097
01:14:24,379 --> 01:14:27,021
[SPEAKER_06]: But we need to do actually more stuff that's like...

1098
01:14:28,401 --> 01:14:28,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Never forget...

1099
01:14:55,605 --> 01:15:11,651
[SPEAKER_05]: when Xbox Live used to discriminate against the word gay being in your profile but they did get rid of that but I remember when I I think we were reporting it here on the show and I was like oh yeah I was really mad about that when that first happened but I kind of forgot that that had happened

1100
01:15:12,151 --> 01:15:33,502
[SPEAKER_05]: so we do need a never forget so that like things that I get mad about and you get mad about and Jamie gets mad about we never forget maybe it could be like a page on the wiki and when one of us says never forget this somebody can add it to the wiki so that way we never forget ah yes I like that idea

1101
01:15:38,259 --> 01:15:44,423
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, surely there's something in your mind.

1102
01:15:44,463 --> 01:15:45,384
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, you know what?

1103
01:15:45,664 --> 01:15:48,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget that this happened.

1104
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Never forget that people are bitches.

1105
01:15:52,269 --> 01:15:53,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's just a given.

1106
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:54,550
[SPEAKER_05]: That has nothing to do with gaming.

1107
01:15:55,211 --> 01:15:55,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

1108
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:56,562
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1109
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:22,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, I think the Portal 2 thing is still happening, but I think that they're under, you know, they're, oh yeah, the event was cancelled, but, you know, then there's gonna be like, oh, haha, Aperture Science has trapped you all, and now you must run through the maze.

1110
01:16:23,107 --> 01:16:25,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Let Jamie get her thought out, and then I've got an idea on that.

1111
01:16:25,688 --> 01:16:35,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, from what I was reading, though, Half-Life 3 is gonna have, actually, Chell from Portal is supposed to be making her appearance, and then they also are talking about the...

1112
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:41,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what's the name of that ship that Aperture put out that's supposed to show up?

1113
01:16:42,518 --> 01:16:44,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Cameo at the end of Portal, isn't it?

1114
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:45,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I think?

1115
01:16:46,282 --> 01:16:49,625
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they mentioned it in that retooled Portal.

1116
01:16:50,646 --> 01:16:57,832
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, but like, it's some ship that, of Aperture's that crashed or something.

1117
01:16:58,052 --> 01:16:59,734
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, I don't remember the whole deal.

1118
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here's what I was supposed to say about the Portal 2 party.

1119
01:17:04,178 --> 01:17:07,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, I bet what they're doing, like did you hear that really fucked up story?

1120
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:09,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget this, by the way.

1121
01:17:09,242 --> 01:17:21,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear that really fucked up story about that school in like Mississippi or whatever where the girl wanted to go to the prom with her girlfriend but they were like, no, because you're a dirty lesbian and we're not going to have that happen at our prom.

1122
01:17:22,113 --> 01:17:23,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they did, you know what they ended up doing?

1123
01:17:24,195 --> 01:17:27,398
[SPEAKER_05]: They threw another prom in

1124
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:35,264
[SPEAKER_05]: and invited like her and her girlfriend and like eight school misfits to like the fake prom and they had like a real prom somewhere else.

1125
01:17:35,284 --> 01:17:36,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was crap.

1126
01:17:36,164 --> 01:17:38,506
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fucked up beyond belief, right?

1127
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:40,928
[SPEAKER_05]: What if that's what they're doing with the Portal 2 party?

1128
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:46,351
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, sorry guys, the Portal 2 party got canceled.

1129
01:17:46,932 --> 01:17:49,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously think... But then suddenly we'll see these reports on the internet about...

1130
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 1up.com got invited to this super secret party.

1131
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:59,861
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I seriously think that they're going to actually have, it's going to be this, you know, oh, it's actually a secret surprise.

1132
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:02,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, the surprise is, you know, oh, look at this.

1133
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:09,887
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the, you know, GLaDOS has hacked the conference or something, you know, something ridiculous like that.

1134
01:18:10,968 --> 01:18:13,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Salacious Pop saves the day, DarkSakura.

1135
01:18:14,452 --> 01:18:15,754
[SPEAKER_05]: The Borealis is the ship.

1136
01:18:15,894 --> 01:18:16,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

1137
01:18:17,816 --> 01:18:20,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it had some sort of celestial name.

1138
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:24,705
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's like the Aurora Borealis.

1139
01:18:25,366 --> 01:18:29,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bobby's reminding us that he was supposed to go to the Portal 2 party and he's a misfit now, so...

1140
01:18:30,812 --> 01:18:35,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Bobby Blackwolf, but it very well could be that you have something in common with a lesbian in Mississippi.

1141
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:36,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Off to the island with you.

1142
01:18:36,494 --> 01:18:38,275
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll throw you your improv.

1143
01:18:38,295 --> 01:18:39,255
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay, Bobby.

1144
01:18:39,735 --> 01:18:43,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get invited to anything, so we can have drinks.

1145
01:18:43,817 --> 01:18:44,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I take that back.

1146
01:18:45,117 --> 01:18:46,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have an appointment to see Rock Band 3.

1147
01:18:46,658 --> 01:18:46,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

1148
01:18:47,778 --> 01:18:48,138
What?

1149
01:18:48,318 --> 01:18:49,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there's that.

1150
01:18:49,779 --> 01:18:50,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, steal a keytar.

1151
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:52,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1152
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:53,220
Lord.

1153
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you'll really be reading about that on the blogs.

1154
01:18:57,116 --> 01:18:58,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, look, let's move on.

1155
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:04,599
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, we need a dose of something really cool and awesome in this show.

1156
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:05,179
[SPEAKER_03]: How about some class?

1157
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:07,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, this show could use a little class.

1158
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, this show could use a lot of class.

1159
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,241
[SPEAKER_03]: More class than a class action lawsuit.

1160
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:19,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, first, I must preface this by saying that it is about the recently knighted Sir Patrick Stewart.

1161
01:19:20,064 --> 01:19:20,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

1162
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:22,931
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me happy.

1163
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:23,953
[SPEAKER_03]: About damn time.

1164
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:26,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you must address him as Sir Patrick Stewart.

1165
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:27,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Sir Patrick Stewart.

1166
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:28,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Patrick Stewart.

1167
01:19:30,241 --> 01:19:36,584
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, he's basically on record saying that he loves his beautiful iPhone.

1168
01:19:37,224 --> 01:19:39,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That it has become an extension of himself.

1169
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:42,607
[SPEAKER_03]: That he couldn't imagine going without it or his laptop.

1170
01:19:43,147 --> 01:19:45,628
[SPEAKER_03]: But that he has a stack of video games.

1171
01:19:45,688 --> 01:19:49,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear Patrick Stewart narrate a story about how much he loves his iPhone.

1172
01:19:49,310 --> 01:19:51,011
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a video on this one too.

1173
01:19:51,371 --> 01:19:51,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1174
01:19:52,191 --> 01:19:53,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about it.

1175
01:19:54,473 --> 01:19:56,974
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's saying that...

1176
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:01,889
[SPEAKER_03]: He has, in fact, I'll read the quote.

1177
01:20:02,209 --> 01:20:08,031
[SPEAKER_03]: The only aspect of all this that I've never taken to, in part because I have an addictive temperament, is gaming.

1178
01:20:08,552 --> 01:20:13,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a stack of games that I've never taken the covers off of because I feel that if I do, I'm finished.

1179
01:20:14,914 --> 01:20:17,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just listen to a little bit of Patrick Stewart?

1180
01:20:17,135 --> 01:20:19,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just listen to his voice?

1181
01:20:19,076 --> 01:20:20,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, first of all, Rob, you saw Jeffrey, right?

1182
01:20:22,057 --> 01:20:23,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see him in Jeffrey?

1183
01:20:23,137 --> 01:20:24,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, years ago.

1184
01:20:24,037 --> 01:20:24,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, I love it.

1185
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:25,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I love him in that movie.

1186
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:26,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1187
01:20:27,099 --> 01:20:28,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, worship.

1188
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems to me to be a little bit simplistic.

1189
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:36,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I like complexity and abstraction too much.

1190
01:20:38,704 --> 01:20:43,467
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, I just handed someone my

1191
01:20:44,636 --> 01:20:52,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful iPhone, which I never have out of my hand and that I do everything with and has become an extension of who I am.

1192
01:20:53,161 --> 01:20:55,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I travel with my laptop everywhere.

1193
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:59,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Emails are absolutely essential in my life.

1194
01:21:00,304 --> 01:21:00,665
[SPEAKER_00]: His voice.

1195
01:21:00,745 --> 01:21:02,666
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like he said sexual in my life.

1196
01:21:02,686 --> 01:21:04,827
[SPEAKER_04]: He did say sexual, didn't he?

1197
01:21:05,207 --> 01:21:06,888
[SPEAKER_03]: He could just read the phone book to me.

1198
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, that was really quiet over the feed.

1199
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:10,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, guys.

1200
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why it's so quiet.

1201
01:21:13,772 --> 01:21:14,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.

1202
01:21:14,517 --> 01:21:15,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1203
01:21:15,817 --> 01:21:17,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Sir Patrick Stewart.

1204
01:21:17,778 --> 01:21:19,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir Patrick Stewart.

1205
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:20,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir Patrick Stewart.

1206
01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:20,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Sir.

1207
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:23,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha.

1208
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,880
[SPEAKER_03]: All you people who don't like Apple, haha.

1209
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:27,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1210
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:30,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Sir Patrick Stewart endorses it.

1211
01:21:30,602 --> 01:21:31,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha.

1212
01:21:31,082 --> 01:21:34,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just because he hasn't touched a droid, right, Loki?

1213
01:21:34,843 --> 01:21:37,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Not since the days of Star Trek The Next Generation has he ever touched a droid.

1214
01:21:38,444 --> 01:21:39,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how about some release dates?

1215
01:21:39,805 --> 01:21:40,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Data would like that.

1216
01:21:42,304 --> 01:21:42,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Release dates.

1217
01:21:42,884 --> 01:21:45,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Traveling around the globe talking about what's coming out in a neighborhood near you.

1218
01:21:46,565 --> 01:21:46,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: This week, not a lot.

1220

[SPEAKER_06]: There's just some weird stuff and some decent stuff.

1221
01:21:54,707 --> 01:21:55,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's start with the weird stuff.

1224
01:22:00,848 --> 01:22:01,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1225
01:22:01,368 --> 01:22:03,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was supposed to come out like two weeks ago.

1226
01:22:03,409 --> 01:22:04,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1227
01:22:04,649 --> 01:22:07,209
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as Loki said that, I had to yawn really bad.

1228
01:22:07,369 --> 01:22:09,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember cracking a Tyra Banks' crazy joke.

1229
01:22:11,495 --> 01:22:16,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that, and she is crazy, but it'll come out when it's ready to come out.

1230
01:22:17,238 --> 01:22:17,878

1233
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:31,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if the Top Model game will have a panty party in it.

1234
01:22:31,967 --> 01:22:34,629
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've never seen this YouTube, you need to YouTube.

1235

[SPEAKER_05]: She goes, we're going to have a panty party.

[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, random.

[SPEAKER_03]: I've been...

1242
01:22:53,726 --> 01:23:04,229

[SPEAKER_05]: And that should be what's on the title, more awesomer than Saints Row 2.

1273
01:26:00,677 --> 01:26:02,838
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 gets the same stuff.

1274
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,440
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City, Just Cause 2, and Saints Row 2.

1275
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,441
[SPEAKER_05]: All the same stuff on the PS3.

1276
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:18,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Over in Japan this week Nintendo Wii gets Karaoke JoySound Wii Enka That comes with a USB microphone You're doing an Enka game?

1277
01:26:18,552 --> 01:26:22,553
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it says That's coming from Hudson Do you know what Enka is?

1278
01:26:23,853 --> 01:26:26,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the Japanese version of folk country music.

1279
01:26:26,794 --> 01:26:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, I have heard some of it.

1280
01:26:28,595 --> 01:26:29,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember me playing you Jero?

1281
01:26:30,056 --> 01:26:32,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I remember that.

1282
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:32,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.

1283
01:26:32,998 --> 01:26:40,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it looks like, I don't know if it's like a version of their karaoke revolution or what, but that is coming out over there.

1284
01:26:40,222 --> 01:26:40,982
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:10,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Rockman Zero Collection Maru Gokaku Shikaku Dasu Gaishiyoshi Saiken

1286
01:27:26,624 --> 01:27:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Wanda of Fortune Portable is the big release on the PSP this week.

1287
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:56,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Wanda Fortune Portable from Idea Factory, an adventure game.

1288
01:27:57,630 --> 01:28:04,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any screenshots, but the characters look like anime Harry Potter people, so I'm sure that'll be fun.

1289
01:28:04,235 --> 01:28:06,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Never forget Zelda, Wanda of Gamelon.

1290
01:28:08,257 --> 01:28:08,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1291
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:09,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that the 3DO game?

1292
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:10,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1293
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:11,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, one of them.

1294
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, cry.

1295
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:16,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I played that at a classic gaming expo a couple years ago.

1296
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:17,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that, too.

1297
01:28:17,424 --> 01:28:18,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It was terrible.

1298
01:28:18,744 --> 01:28:19,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1299
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:24,034
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how about the old country?

1300
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:28,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, really not a whole lot.

1301
01:28:29,197 --> 01:28:31,239
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 8th is Green Day Rock Band.

1302
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,600
[SPEAKER_03]: 9th is Joe Danger.

1303
01:28:35,842 --> 01:28:44,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And then toward the end of the week on the 11th we have King Arthur Mega Man Zero Collection, Naval Assault, The Killing Tide, and Super Mario Galaxy 2.

1304
01:28:47,182 --> 01:28:47,542
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

1305
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:49,163
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over!

1306
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:53,124
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, surprised that no one in studio had anything to say on Super Mario Galaxy 2.

1307
01:28:53,885 --> 01:28:58,987
[SPEAKER_05]: My Wii is still not hooked up, that's why I haven't bought the game yet, but I am hearing phenomenal things about the game.

1308
01:28:59,707 --> 01:29:03,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So have I, I'm just kind of... I know, it's kind of under the radar right now.

1309
01:29:03,068 --> 01:29:07,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of one of those games I hope I can go back to and play at some point, but for right now it's kind of on the back burner.

1310
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:10,691
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I've heard lots and lots of good things about Mario Galaxy 2.

1311
01:29:11,092 --> 01:29:12,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently OutShines the first.

1312
01:29:13,192 --> 01:29:13,673
[SPEAKER_05]: In many ways.

1313
01:29:13,733 --> 01:29:14,613
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be impressive.

1314
01:29:15,089 --> 01:29:16,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the first was not a bad game at all.

1315
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:21,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps Nintendo can send me a free copy once I pimp out my room in New Super Mario Bros.

1316
01:29:21,938 --> 01:29:22,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh?

1317
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:22,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh?

1318
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:23,220
[SPEAKER_05]: You should try it.

1319
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:23,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink?

1320
01:29:23,561 --> 01:29:24,362
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

1321
01:29:24,722 --> 01:29:25,804
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, future gamer!

1322
01:29:27,906 --> 01:29:28,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Teaching them young.

1323
01:29:29,647 --> 01:29:32,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, when you do that to your kid, your kid's going to rebel.

1324
01:29:32,948 --> 01:29:38,191
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have a kid that wants to go out and play football all day.

1325
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:39,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if he wants to go play football.

1326
01:29:39,672 --> 01:29:40,272
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine with me.

1327
01:29:40,412 --> 01:29:42,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not forcing him to like video games.

1328
01:29:42,433 --> 01:29:44,034
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just the theme we're doing his room in.

1329
01:29:44,194 --> 01:29:44,894
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, fair enough.

1330
01:29:44,934 --> 01:29:45,835
[SPEAKER_06]: He can do whatever he wants.

1331
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:50,917
[SPEAKER_06]: If he wants to go work on cars and play football and that kind of stuff, that's fine with me.

1332
01:29:50,937 --> 01:29:51,697
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom was a painter.

1333
01:29:51,717 --> 01:29:52,318
[SPEAKER_05]: He won't, though.

1334
01:29:52,998 --> 01:29:53,619
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I need to poo?

1335
01:30:08,991 --> 01:30:15,215
[SPEAKER_06]: But my dad, on the other hand, he, see, he bought a ColecoVision for himself and Atari games and stuff.

1336
01:30:15,235 --> 01:30:15,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1337
01:30:15,675 --> 01:30:17,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just naturally started playing those.

1338
01:30:18,056 --> 01:30:20,298
[SPEAKER_06]: They bought me a Texas Instruments computer.

1339
01:30:20,758 --> 01:30:22,739
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, because you were born in like 81, right?

1340
01:30:22,999 --> 01:30:23,580
[SPEAKER_06]: When all that was out?

1341
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:23,920
[SPEAKER_06]: No, in 80.

1342
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:23,920
80?

1343
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, 80.

1344
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:25,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1345
01:30:25,681 --> 01:30:29,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, all that stuff came out and just naturally I got into it.

1346
01:30:30,043 --> 01:30:34,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And the stuff that I was into, like, when I was that old, you know, I'm into now even more so.

1347
01:30:34,446 --> 01:30:34,546
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

1348
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:38,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1349
01:30:38,908 --> 01:30:40,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to force it upon you.

1350
01:30:40,989 --> 01:30:43,530
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to play games because my wife hates games.

1351
01:30:44,191 --> 01:30:47,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is ironic that she suggested that we do a Mario Brothers themed room.

1352
01:30:48,372 --> 01:30:49,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Never would have thought that.

1353
01:30:49,413 --> 01:30:51,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1354
01:30:51,094 --> 01:30:53,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Your wife does have those random moments of gaming.

1355
01:30:54,475 --> 01:30:55,176
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

1356
01:31:21,536 --> 01:31:23,497
[SPEAKER_06]: They only have so much ground.

1357
01:31:23,597 --> 01:31:26,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like four feet worth of the ground vinyl.

1358
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:29,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just can't circle the room with that stuff.

1359
01:31:29,802 --> 01:31:30,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to paint everything.

1360
01:31:31,002 --> 01:31:34,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not going to spend money to buy enough sheets to cover the whole room.

1361
01:31:34,885 --> 01:31:35,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be ridiculous.

1362
01:31:36,266 --> 01:31:38,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are all the guests leaving the funny comments tonight?

1363
01:31:38,928 --> 01:31:42,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Guest 5872, please change your name, folks.

1364
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:44,692
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get in there, type slash Nick and then the new name.

1365
01:31:44,712 --> 01:31:45,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And I congratulate you appropriately.

1366
01:31:46,193 --> 01:31:47,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you get booted.

1367
01:31:47,414 --> 01:31:48,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Suki-ban-sa-chu-re-na.

1368
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:49,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1369
01:31:49,555 --> 01:31:51,775
[SPEAKER_05]: You should do this room in President Cat.

1370
01:31:53,316 --> 01:31:54,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly it's a listener of the show.

1371
01:31:54,916 --> 01:31:57,176
[SPEAKER_06]: We almost did it in Stella themed.

1372
01:31:57,236 --> 01:31:58,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Stella would be my cat.

1373
01:32:00,217 --> 01:32:01,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would be weird.

1374
01:32:01,357 --> 01:32:01,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Kitty themed.

1375
01:32:01,997 --> 01:32:04,138
[SPEAKER_06]: She is a little bitch.

1376
01:32:06,198 --> 01:32:12,259
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants me to play, because we made her a toy out of bag handles.

1377
01:32:12,579 --> 01:32:15,760
[SPEAKER_06]: They're these little string handles or whatever, and we tied them together.

1378
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:16,600
[SPEAKER_06]: And now she'll go...

1379
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,943
[SPEAKER_06]: She locked her in a room with Shermie

1380
01:32:27,373 --> 01:32:27,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1381
01:32:28,394 --> 01:32:29,815
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta move on, guys.

1382
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:32,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We're an hour and a half into Part A and we're not even done yet.

1383
01:32:32,197 --> 01:32:34,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But we haven't talked about my cat enough yet!

1384
01:32:34,278 --> 01:32:34,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1385
01:32:34,839 --> 01:32:36,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want a cat, y'all.

1386
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:37,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting to that point.

1387
01:32:37,921 --> 01:32:40,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's time for me to be a daddy.

1388
01:32:41,703 --> 01:32:42,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob needs to be a daddy.

1389
01:32:42,464 --> 01:32:43,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you're in luck.

1390
01:32:43,765 --> 01:32:45,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have a cat for you.

1391
01:32:46,047 --> 01:32:47,328
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't want your cat.

1392
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:48,208
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not my cat.

1393
01:32:48,268 --> 01:32:48,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw that.

1394
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:49,149
[SPEAKER_06]: My cat's

1395
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:53,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about Barney, the female cat outside.

1396
01:32:54,970 --> 01:33:04,552
[SPEAKER_06]: She's still a wild cat, and yeah, I don't know why we call her Barney, but that's the name we gave her before we found out that she was a girl, and so it just stuck.

1397
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:11,593
[SPEAKER_06]: But she actually is very friendly and comes up to us and stuff, so I will trap her for you if you want.

1398
01:33:12,593 --> 01:33:13,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great.

1399
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:15,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought you a kitty in a box.

1400
01:33:15,894 --> 01:33:16,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Adopt a cat, Rob.

1401
01:33:17,034 --> 01:33:19,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not going to do it just yet.

1402
01:33:20,475 --> 01:33:21,935
[SPEAKER_05]: They're so easy to take care of, though.

1403
01:33:21,995 --> 01:33:24,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but remember, I'm gone every weekend, you guys.

1404
01:33:25,196 --> 01:33:25,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Every weekend I'm gone.

1405
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:27,757
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll go take care of your cat on the weekends.

1406
01:33:27,897 --> 01:33:28,677
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you won't.

1407
01:33:28,717 --> 01:33:29,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too far.

1408
01:33:30,318 --> 01:33:32,658
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I go take care of Susan's cat when she goes out of town.

1409
01:33:32,718 --> 01:33:33,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1410
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:33,778
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

1411
01:33:33,818 --> 01:33:34,539
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, guys.

1412
01:33:34,699 --> 01:33:36,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I would take care of your pussy.

1413
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you pet my pussy when it needed it?

1414
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:40,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I would.

1415
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:41,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

1416
01:33:42,301 --> 01:33:43,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And give it a bath.

1417
01:33:45,603 --> 01:33:46,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I've watched Shermie.

1418
01:33:46,885 --> 01:33:48,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you wash my pussy on the weekend?

1419
01:33:50,488 --> 01:33:51,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've got a schedule.

1420
01:33:52,511 --> 01:33:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget how mature we are here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1421
01:33:56,115 --> 01:33:57,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, a couple quick stories for you.

1422
01:33:57,776 --> 01:33:58,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Classic Game of the Week coming up.

1423
01:33:59,058 --> 01:34:00,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you got for us?

1424
01:34:00,737 --> 01:34:08,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so we were talking a little bit about Project $10 and how EA likes to find ways to milk you for your precious money.

1425
01:34:09,265 --> 01:34:16,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now they're doing it again, and this isn't something that you necessarily have to do, but it's something you may be tempted to do.

1426
01:34:17,273 --> 01:34:22,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Madden 11 basically logs everything that you do online.

1427
01:34:22,955 --> 01:34:27,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Your play calling, what tendencies you do, and that kind of stuff.

1428
01:34:27,456 --> 01:34:29,136
[SPEAKER_06]: And it builds kind of a playbook.

1429
01:34:29,156 --> 01:34:29,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

1430
01:34:29,557 --> 01:34:30,897
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't see your porn collection, can it?

1431
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:31,657
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1432
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:33,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It can't see your porn collection.

1433
01:34:34,218 --> 01:34:40,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And it basically builds like a playbook that kind of revolves around what you do.

1434
01:34:41,800 --> 01:35:00,289
[SPEAKER_06]: and um now during if you you know play i guess enough people or whatever uh other people can get that from you but um you can actually purchase um these reports as well so that you can kind of get the dirt on the other players that you're playing against

1435
01:35:02,672 --> 01:35:24,662
[SPEAKER_05]: and um that's kind of strange like I don't really have another word for that that's just I don't know I mean well yeah you of course sell it take all that information and then sell it it's kind of shady but it's kind of like them selling the cheats that were in the games you know you cheats that used to be just button presses now you have to pay two dollars to unlock and type stuff

1436
01:35:25,682 --> 01:35:29,766
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... It's such a desperate money grab.

1437
01:35:29,806 --> 01:35:31,848
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

1438
01:35:32,469 --> 01:35:34,751
[SPEAKER_06]: You're becoming that desperate chick, EA.

1439
01:35:35,491 --> 01:35:36,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody likes desperate chick.

1440
01:35:36,893 --> 01:35:38,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything they can do, right?

1441
01:35:38,994 --> 01:35:40,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Any place they can get more money.

1442
01:35:40,956 --> 01:35:41,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop being so...

1443
01:35:41,917 --> 01:35:42,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1444
01:35:42,397 --> 01:35:44,219
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just there's no real benefit if you don't do it, I guess.

1445
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:44,859
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1446
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:49,203
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to charge me for online for used or whatever than the real game.

1447
01:35:49,243 --> 01:35:49,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1448
01:36:12,741 --> 01:36:15,722
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess if you buy it, you knew it really doesn't affect you anyways.

1449
01:36:16,262 --> 01:36:17,822
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, though, don't let it slide.

1450
01:36:17,902 --> 01:36:18,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1451
01:36:20,863 --> 01:36:21,123
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1452
01:36:21,923 --> 01:36:24,244
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to make you even more angry, you guys.

1453
01:36:24,604 --> 01:36:27,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, there is a draft.

1454
01:36:27,845 --> 01:36:28,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a law yet.

1455
01:36:28,945 --> 01:36:32,346
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a draft that the Federal Trade Commission here in the U.S.

1456
01:36:32,446 --> 01:36:33,226
[SPEAKER_05]: making this draft.

1457
01:36:34,286 --> 01:36:40,948
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making some proposals to Washington, and apparently one of them is a 5% tax on consumer electronics.

1458
01:36:42,031 --> 01:36:46,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, some folks are calling this the iPad tax, but it's not just iPads, you guys.

1459
01:36:46,614 --> 01:36:48,116
[SPEAKER_05]: It really should be just iPads, though.

1460
01:36:48,256 --> 01:36:56,562
[SPEAKER_05]: iPhones, iMacs, Zunes, DSs, 360s, laptops, digital cameras.

1461
01:36:56,582 --> 01:37:00,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, basically Best Buy is fucked.

1462
01:37:00,244 --> 01:37:03,367
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of things you buy there are going to have a 5% tax on it.

1463
01:37:03,387 --> 01:37:04,908
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to pass it on to the consumer.

1464
01:37:05,228 --> 01:37:06,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are they doing this, folks?

1465
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:06,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1466
01:37:07,351 --> 01:37:16,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it will generate $4 billion for the US government, which it could then use to subsidize failing media outlets like newspapers.

1467
01:37:19,361 --> 01:37:20,643
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1468
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:37,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that long ago.

1469
01:37:37,421 --> 01:37:52,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember reading, and maybe it wasn't on this show, but about how the iPad is reinvigorating the old school media because a lot of these newspapers are coming out with editions for the iPad that they're selling subscriptions to, and they're actually doing quite well.

1470
01:37:52,184 --> 01:37:53,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And magazines are doing this too.

1471
01:37:54,164 --> 01:37:56,265
[SPEAKER_05]: The iPad is becoming this new reading device.

1472
01:37:56,745 --> 01:38:02,766
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like, why do we need to save your archaic ass if you're not going to evolve?

1473
01:38:04,707 --> 01:38:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't make sense.

1474
01:38:06,427 --> 01:38:10,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it hasn't passed yet, but it's a dumb idea.

1475
01:38:11,949 --> 01:38:13,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't like what they're using the money for.

1476
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:16,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the money could go to the more important things.

1477
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:18,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do we have to bail out the news media?

1478
01:38:18,971 --> 01:38:20,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they sell ads.

1479
01:38:20,972 --> 01:38:25,093
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to evolve and adopt to where their readers are.

1480
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:26,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get some of that money?

1481
01:38:26,953 --> 01:38:27,593
[SPEAKER_05]: We're media.

1482
01:38:30,134 --> 01:38:31,074
[SPEAKER_05]: We're floundering.

1483
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:33,355
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't made a dime since this show began.

1484
01:38:35,703 --> 01:38:37,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I want four billion dollars.

1485
01:38:37,964 --> 01:38:39,364
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's stupid.

1486
01:38:40,145 --> 01:38:41,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop bailing out companies.

1487
01:38:42,846 --> 01:38:43,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1488
01:38:44,246 --> 01:38:49,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well let's move on to a part of the show that needs no bailing out.

1489
01:38:49,048 --> 01:38:51,249
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very popular here on the Orange Lounge Radio.

1490
01:38:51,629 --> 01:38:53,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And every week you guys come to know and love this segment.

1491
01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:56,931
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the classic game of the week.

1492
01:38:58,451 --> 01:38:58,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob?

1493
01:38:59,271 --> 01:38:59,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1494
01:38:59,852 --> 01:39:03,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that everyone's going to figure out what this game is when you play the opening sequence.

1495
01:39:04,312 --> 01:39:21,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so then, well, let me just say though, every week, for those that maybe have never listened to Orange House Radio before, every week, DarkSakura likes to go through the vault, the classic video game vault, and pick out a game that she says, hey, you ungrateful little bastards playing on the lawn, you need to go play this classic video game immediately.

1496
01:39:21,459 --> 01:39:22,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Get off my lawn and play this game.

1497
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:23,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1498
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's what we should rename the segment, get off my lawn and play this game.

1499
01:39:28,042 --> 01:39:31,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is tonight's classic game of the week.

1500
01:39:41,553 --> 01:39:42,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear Solid

1501
01:39:55,351 --> 01:39:57,232
[SPEAKER_03]: and who said Barbie?

1502
01:39:57,752 --> 01:39:58,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1503
01:39:59,173 --> 01:39:59,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1504
01:40:00,613 --> 01:40:11,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid, a stealth action game that was directed and written by the guy I used to run into every year at E3, Hideo Kojima.

1505
01:40:12,758 --> 01:40:23,662
[SPEAKER_03]: It first came out in 1998 for the PlayStation and it's actually the sequel to the MSX2 Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake.

1506
01:40:24,042 --> 01:40:25,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the one that we got over here.

1507
01:40:25,905 --> 01:40:28,388
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual MSX version.

1508
01:40:28,608 --> 01:40:30,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what in the actual hell is this video?

1509
01:40:30,751 --> 01:40:33,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually 3 hours and 20 minutes long.

1510
01:40:33,074 --> 01:40:34,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, people can do this on YouTube now?

1511
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:35,897
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the playthrough of the first half of the game.

1512
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:37,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were limited to 10 minutes.

1513
01:40:37,659 --> 01:40:38,060
[SPEAKER_03]: In theory.

1514
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:38,180
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1515
01:40:42,646 --> 01:40:44,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the voice acting in this.

1516
01:40:44,667 --> 01:40:50,293
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, the guy who did Snake's voice was David Hayter and he also wrote the first two X-Men movies.

1517
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:51,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why they were good.

1518
01:40:52,615 --> 01:40:53,576
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third one blew.

1519
01:40:54,037 --> 01:40:55,939
[SPEAKER_03]: He had written the third one and it would have been good.

1520
01:40:56,479 --> 01:40:56,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1521
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Both are being held as hostages.

1522
01:40:59,782 --> 01:41:06,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the one that brought Metal Gear up to the current generation of gamers.

1523
01:41:06,628 --> 01:41:22,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically he's going in and stopping a group called Foxhound, which was his old unit, has to liberate some hostages and basically stop them from...

1524
01:41:24,395 --> 01:41:25,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, blowing up the earth, I guess.

1525
01:41:27,979 --> 01:41:29,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I hate it when people try to blow up the earth.

1526
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:32,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play Thermonuclear War.

1527
01:41:33,746 --> 01:41:37,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it has amazing voice acting.

1528
01:41:38,071 --> 01:41:42,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And even with the limitations of the visuals back in the day,

1529
01:41:43,317 --> 01:41:54,081
[SPEAKER_03]: They really did a good job in covering up the things that would have been harder to show, like blurring the face a little bit, smoothing the line here or there.

1530
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:56,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It really did look very good for its day.

1531
01:41:57,162 --> 01:42:06,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get all kinds of bonus stuff to use in the game, because it's on-site weapons procurement, as well as being played like the old ones.

1532
01:42:07,365 --> 01:42:15,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can also get infrared goggles and a cardboard box and he smuggles his cigarettes in through his stomach.

1533
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:19,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it mean that he barfs up his cigarettes as soon as he lands?

1534
01:42:19,373 --> 01:42:20,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps, I don't know.

1535
01:42:21,495 --> 01:42:24,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you have to use the cigarettes to get through a couple of stages, too.

1536
01:42:24,817 --> 01:42:27,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's funny.

1537
01:42:27,259 --> 01:42:34,944
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, as you can tell from listening to all the speaking in the background, lots of cutscenes and conversations.

1538
01:42:35,004 --> 01:42:36,946
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is very dialogue heavy.

1539
01:42:38,967 --> 01:42:42,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the plus side, it's very good voice acting.

1540
01:42:42,429 --> 01:42:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, why don't you turn it up a little bit?

1541
01:42:46,032 --> 01:42:47,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it's a little bit quiet, but here you go.

1542
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:53,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's when he's about to land, so... There's no voice acting right now.

1543
01:42:53,631 --> 01:42:54,571
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some in a second.

1544
01:42:56,112 --> 01:42:57,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at the part where he breaks through the water.

1545
01:42:59,132 --> 01:43:01,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the start menu of the game.

1546
01:43:03,814 --> 01:43:07,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can do it.

1547
01:43:07,215 --> 01:43:08,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the music in this game.

1548
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:09,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have the soundtrack.

1549
01:43:09,295 --> 01:43:10,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the soundtrack to all the Metal Gear Solid games.

1550
01:43:12,456 --> 01:43:15,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also pick up all the art books for Dan every year.

1551
01:43:16,757 --> 01:43:17,277
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate...

1552
01:43:19,778 --> 01:43:24,903
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole first part of the game is to teach you the whole stealth part of the game.

1553
01:43:25,443 --> 01:43:30,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get the stealth down, you can actually go through the whole game for the most part without killing people.

1554
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,991
[SPEAKER_03]: You get bonuses, I think, for the fewer that you kill.

1555
01:43:35,712 --> 01:43:46,315
[SPEAKER_03]: but you also have to sort of maintain a working knowledge of how the entire facility is laid out as you go through it because you have to run back through it part of the way.

1556
01:43:47,255 --> 01:44:00,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The characters you have in this one is, I think this is funny, the character designer said that Solid State's physique was based off of Jean-Claude Van Damme but his face was based off of Christopher Walken.

1557
01:44:01,917 --> 01:44:02,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see that.

1558
01:44:02,998 --> 01:44:05,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's a little bit better looking than Christopher Walken.

1559
01:44:08,162 --> 01:44:21,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got Roy Campbell, who is his former CO, and then you have Master Miller, and Mei Ling, and Naomi Hunter, and Natasha Romanenko, who is a weapons person.

1560
01:44:21,534 --> 01:44:27,399
[SPEAKER_03]: But you also get Otacon, who is named after the convention.

1561
01:44:27,479 --> 01:44:28,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some voice acting.

1562
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:29,040
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1563
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:33,743
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other thing I was gonna bring up is that this game totally breaks the fourth wall, like, all the time.

1564
01:44:57,249 --> 01:45:08,261
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, when you run into one of the other hostages, he tells you about a soldier that Snake ran into earlier who ends up being Meryl.

1565
01:45:09,022 --> 01:45:11,725
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, yeah, you can contact her on Kodak.

1566
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:15,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I remember, her number is on the back of the CD case.

1567
01:45:16,531 --> 01:45:16,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1568
01:45:17,344 --> 01:45:17,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Psycho Mantis

1569
01:45:47,644 --> 01:45:49,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You better hide somewhere.

1570
01:46:13,588 --> 01:46:29,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, you go through the game, you get to see Metal Gear Rex, and, um, oh yeah, you also have, um, a, uh, an informant called Deep Throat, which I thought was a kind of neat nod towards, um, well, you know, there was an actual Deep Throat.

1571
01:46:29,833 --> 01:46:30,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Towards Linda Lovelace?

1572
01:46:30,854 --> 01:46:31,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, sorry, no.

1573
01:46:32,034 --> 01:46:34,336
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual, yeah, no, I know Watergate, of course I know Watergate.

1574
01:46:34,356 --> 01:46:36,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And he finally, finally came forward.

1575
01:46:36,337 --> 01:46:37,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's right, like right before he died, right?

1576
01:46:37,978 --> 01:46:38,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1577
01:46:38,919 --> 01:46:40,660
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think he was declassified at the time.

1578
01:46:41,681 --> 01:46:48,086
[SPEAKER_03]: So, man, that's something else though, being able to hold a secret that long, you know?

1579
01:46:50,208 --> 01:47:00,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you go through the game, you have an epic battle with Liquid Snake, who is the antagonist and Solid Snake's twin.

1580
01:47:01,223 --> 01:47:05,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also have two endings based on what you do during the torture sequence.

1581
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:08,512
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them, Meryl gets to live.

1582
01:47:09,634 --> 01:47:10,775
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one, Meryl dies.

1583
01:47:11,856 --> 01:47:11,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

1584
01:47:13,078 --> 01:47:15,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's my favorite question in the whole game.

1585
01:47:16,041 --> 01:47:18,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on the battlefield?

1586
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:25,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does love always feel like a battlefield?

1587
01:47:25,692 --> 01:47:26,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Battlefield.

1588
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:28,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Battlefield.

1589
01:47:28,535 --> 01:47:32,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, for tie-ins, and I know I've brought up Policenauts before.

1590
01:47:35,222 --> 01:47:38,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Meryl was a character in Policenauts.

1591
01:47:39,486 --> 01:47:40,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was included.

1592
01:47:43,808 --> 01:47:50,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's references to Metal Gear in Policenauts.

1593
01:47:51,191 --> 01:47:59,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I think scenes from Policenauts that go through when Otacon is talking about being a big geek.

1594
01:48:00,215 --> 01:48:01,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, he's a big otaku.

1595
01:48:03,056 --> 01:48:03,837
[SPEAKER_03]: He pees himself, too.

1596
01:48:05,171 --> 01:48:09,175
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you meet him, seriously, he backs into a corner and pisses himself.

1597
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:10,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello LP joke.

1598
01:48:11,377 --> 01:48:13,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1599
01:48:16,422 --> 01:48:24,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also preliminary artwork that was an Easter egg for Policenaut's pilot disc for the 3DO, which I think didn't come out, actually.

1600
01:48:25,736 --> 01:48:29,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there were some side stories.

1601
01:48:29,678 --> 01:48:44,625
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Metal Gear Solid Integral, which is based off of the expanded Japanese version, except it had a VR mode with it.

1602
01:48:45,185 --> 01:48:47,586
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the VR missions as a separate disc.

1603
01:48:48,406 --> 01:48:52,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But it had like a PS, you remember the Pocket Station, Rob?

1604
01:48:54,196 --> 01:48:55,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a Pocket Station minigame.

1605
01:48:57,778 --> 01:49:03,240
[SPEAKER_03]: You could call the codec frequency and get commentary from the staff.

1606
01:49:03,401 --> 01:49:07,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had a first-person game mode.

1607
01:49:08,963 --> 01:49:14,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was also Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes, which came out on GameCube.

1608
01:49:14,105 --> 01:49:15,426
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that sneaking suit working out?

1609
01:49:15,866 --> 01:49:21,327
[SPEAKER_03]: And also one that people may not be familiar with, the BLEEM version for BLEEMcast.

1610
01:49:22,547 --> 01:49:27,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Which basically, it ran it through with the Dreamcast's superior rendering capabilities, and it was really nice.

1611
01:49:27,989 --> 01:49:28,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got it.

1612
01:49:29,669 --> 01:49:37,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I totally suggest everyone look up BLEEM for Dreamcast, Metal Gear Solid, and then compare them side by side.

1613
01:49:37,731 --> 01:49:38,511
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is night and day.

1614
01:49:41,153 --> 01:49:42,455
[SPEAKER_03]: The soundtrack was amazing.

1615
01:49:42,695 --> 01:49:44,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done by Rika Muranaka.

1616
01:49:49,584 --> 01:49:58,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, the ending song was done by her, and it's also sung in Irish for the ending.

1617
01:49:59,027 --> 01:50:01,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny.

1618
01:50:01,708 --> 01:50:04,369
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, from there we got all kinds of others.

1619
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:10,710
[SPEAKER_03]: We got digital comics, we got a graphic novel, and then, of course, there were all of the sequels.

1620
01:50:11,251 --> 01:50:14,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solitude, The Avengers of Raiden running around naked.

1621
01:50:15,472 --> 01:50:15,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Pfft.

1622
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:20,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever play that one, Rob?

1623
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:21,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one?

1624
01:50:22,352 --> 01:50:23,052
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one.

1625
01:50:23,852 --> 01:50:25,273
[SPEAKER_05]: A very little, very, very little.

1626
01:50:25,613 --> 01:50:28,815
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Metal Gear, it was Sons of Liberty.

1627
01:50:30,537 --> 01:50:33,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake is in there calling himself Iroquois Plissken.

1628
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:37,583
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Plissken also from Snake Plissken.

1629
01:50:38,704 --> 01:50:45,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater, where he's actually playing as Naked Snake, who turns out to be Big Boss.

1630
01:50:46,109 --> 01:50:46,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Spoiler!

1631
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, where have you been?

1632
01:50:49,092 --> 01:50:52,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Metal Gear Solid 4 Guns of the Patriots.

1633
01:50:53,695 --> 01:50:53,995
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong?

1634
01:50:54,015 --> 01:50:54,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

1635
01:50:54,255 --> 01:50:57,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so... cute.

1636
01:51:17,341 --> 01:51:18,524
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just flattering me.

1637
01:51:18,885 --> 01:51:19,788
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm serious.

1638
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:23,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours.

1639
01:51:23,498 --> 01:51:23,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

1640
01:51:25,009 --> 01:51:27,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe I'm being hit on by the famous Solid Snake.

1641
01:51:28,772 --> 01:51:30,213
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm surprised.

1642
01:51:30,653 --> 01:51:30,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1643
01:51:31,354 --> 01:51:38,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, if you keep talking to her, she'll give you like a little parable or a little phrase.

1644
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:41,221
[SPEAKER_03]: She's basically your fortune cookie throughout the game.

1645
01:51:41,701 --> 01:51:44,363
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you keep calling her, she'll eventually just get mad at you.

1646
01:51:44,984 --> 01:51:46,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And her answer will be dot, dot, dot.

1647
01:51:46,645 --> 01:51:47,866
[SPEAKER_03]: And she'll have this big frowny face.

1648
01:51:49,665 --> 01:51:55,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another... I think it was in the second one?

1649
01:51:55,492 --> 01:52:04,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it in the first one where you're in the locker and if you look at the picture of the girl and then call someone on the codec, it sounds like he's jerking off.

1650
01:52:05,122 --> 01:52:05,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1651
01:52:07,245 --> 01:52:07,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1652
01:52:08,386 --> 01:52:10,327
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Easter eggs in this game.

1653
01:52:10,547 --> 01:52:13,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Otacon tells him, we don't have time for that snake.

1654
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:15,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the second one.

1655
01:52:15,391 --> 01:52:18,013
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, we don't have time for that snake.

1656
01:52:18,954 --> 01:52:20,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just got the O face.

1657
01:52:20,635 --> 01:52:21,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.

1658
01:52:21,876 --> 01:52:22,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.

1659
01:52:23,138 --> 01:52:23,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew.

1660
01:52:23,278 --> 01:52:25,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I know a little bit too much about the Metal Gear games.

1661
01:52:25,499 --> 01:52:26,000
[SPEAKER_05]: You sure do.

1662
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:27,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but that's alright.

1663
01:52:27,401 --> 01:52:29,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that it for the wrap up?

1664
01:52:29,723 --> 01:52:30,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1665
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:30,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1666
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,423
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta move on with the show.

1667
01:52:33,707 --> 01:52:36,155
[SPEAKER_05]: That was an epic game of the week there.

1668
01:52:36,336 --> 01:52:36,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic.

1669
01:52:36,898 --> 01:52:38,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already losing my voice again.

1670
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Metal Gear Solid is your classic game of the week, and a true classic at that.

1671
01:52:43,263 --> 01:52:46,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we are going to take a quick break so that we can rest our voices and all that fun stuff.

1672
01:52:46,666 --> 01:52:47,186
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be back.

1673
01:52:47,206 --> 01:52:48,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We have plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to go.

1674
01:52:48,787 --> 01:52:50,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a long episode tonight, you guys.

1675
01:52:50,389 --> 01:52:55,773
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about a new game from the creator of Parappa the Rappa, possible upgrades of old PS2 titles.

1676
01:52:55,893 --> 01:52:57,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Goldeneye could be making a comeback.

1677
01:52:57,534 --> 01:53:00,336
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk all about that in Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

1678
01:53:00,356 --> 01:53:01,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go anywhere, folks.

1679
01:53:01,297 --> 01:53:04,319
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1680
01:53:10,199 --> 01:53:16,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, June the 6th of 2010 where we are doing episode number 369 of our show.

1681
01:53:20,750 --> 01:53:22,051
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 is just around the corner.

1682
01:53:22,111 --> 01:53:25,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we've had a lot of news and rumors and stuff about what's coming up at E3.

1683
01:53:25,974 --> 01:53:31,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I think our show is taping live tonight while the MTV Movie Awards are going on, I think is the big thing tonight.

1684
01:53:32,659 --> 01:53:35,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And as to who's winning right now, I don't care.

1685
01:53:35,901 --> 01:53:37,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, are those awards relevant?

1686
01:53:37,062 --> 01:53:37,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they actually mean anything?

1687
01:53:38,062 --> 01:53:41,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it just an excuse to get a bunch of celebrities together for ratings?

1688
01:53:42,886 --> 01:53:43,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1689
01:53:44,267 --> 01:53:44,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1690
01:53:45,137 --> 01:53:46,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel too.

1691
01:53:46,858 --> 01:53:59,364
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so let's get back into some gaming news then, some things we care about around here, and some rapid, quick stories for you guys here before we get back to some Twitter topics, which we're going to get to in a moment, at twitter.com slash OLR.

1692
01:53:59,424 --> 01:54:02,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've probably got like three minutes to get in your topics if you haven't yet.

1693
01:54:02,685 --> 01:54:05,607
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, let's do some rapid fire news.

1694
01:54:06,047 --> 01:54:12,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the first of hopefully many pieces of download content for Red Dead Redemption will be coming out soon.

1695
01:54:12,894 --> 01:54:19,380
[SPEAKER_06]: On June 22nd, Outlaws to the End will be adding some new content to the game.

1696
01:54:19,841 --> 01:54:24,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Six online co-op missions for two to four players.

1697
01:54:25,006 --> 01:54:29,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, they're going to have some different...

1698
01:54:31,960 --> 01:54:33,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, different types of missions in there.

1699
01:54:33,821 --> 01:54:36,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like one where you're escorting a raft, which is kind of cool.

1700
01:54:37,584 --> 01:54:49,032
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be great because I don't know about people that have played Red Dead Redemption, but the gang hideouts that you can actually play during free mode, I think we've gone through all of those at least six times now.

1701
01:54:49,313 --> 01:54:54,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It's getting old fast, and we need some more things to play.

1702
01:54:54,617 --> 01:54:56,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be awesome.

1703
01:54:57,719 --> 01:55:01,803
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course that is going to be free on the 22nd.

1704
01:55:04,045 --> 01:55:17,018
[SPEAKER_06]: We Party is going to be one of the games that are going to be shown off this year at Nintendo's press conference and it's going to feature 80 plus games including some interesting ones.

1705
01:55:17,418 --> 01:55:19,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Remote Control Hide and Seek

1706
01:55:20,322 --> 01:55:21,063
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

1707
01:55:21,423 --> 01:55:29,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the players will hide their Wii remotes somewhere in the room and the other players have to search for it by the sound coming from the controller's speaker.

1708
01:55:30,498 --> 01:55:30,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1709
01:55:33,154 --> 01:55:50,167
[SPEAKER_05]: groundbreaking and revolutionary I will give them props for being somewhat unique some of the other games they were talking about called 1-1 Karuta wouldn't it be funny if like you hit the thing too good and then it's too far away from the Wii to make a noise or whatever so it gets lost forever

1710
01:55:50,347 --> 01:55:51,007
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be funny.

1711
01:55:51,107 --> 01:55:52,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucker, gotta buy another $40 controller.

1712
01:55:53,588 --> 01:56:03,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Wanwan Karuta is a game where the Wii Remote will make a sound and the players will have to match the noise with an on-screen image, for example an animal.

1713
01:56:03,932 --> 01:56:14,475
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have a game called Sensitive Bomb which players will pass the single remote to one another without trying to jostle it too much to trigger the explosion.

1714
01:56:15,376 --> 01:56:17,916
[SPEAKER_06]: So what you do is you pass it to another player and then you push them.

1715
01:56:18,537 --> 01:56:19,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha ha!

1716
01:56:20,738 --> 01:56:23,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That's playing with power.

1717
01:56:24,821 --> 01:56:28,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll be, of course, shown at the press conference on June 15th.

1718
01:56:30,324 --> 01:56:31,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other fun stuff.

1719
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:35,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Will Reggie Fils-Aimé come out and try to blow somebody up and push them and all that stuff, you think?

1720
01:56:36,007 --> 01:56:41,530
[SPEAKER_06]: He won't because he's probably endorsing family play that's not destructive like that.

1721
01:56:42,411 --> 01:56:43,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit.

1722
01:56:44,912 --> 01:56:46,373
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no rules in Wii Parking.

1723
01:56:48,054 --> 01:56:53,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, K'nex is apparently teaming up with Nintendo to make some Mario Kart toys.

1724
01:56:54,198 --> 01:56:57,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is supposed to be happening sometime in 2011.

1725
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:06,447
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is awesome that you can make toys based on Mario Kart and K'nex because, you know, hey, if it's not Lego, it's K'nex.

1726
01:57:06,787 --> 01:57:09,889
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be, uh, be fun.

1727
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:15,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to have like Lego or K'nex toys based on like the Mario stuff.

1728
01:57:17,978 --> 01:57:22,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, Salacious Pop is keeping us updated in chat on the MTV Movie Awards.

1729
01:57:23,262 --> 01:57:24,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's why you're glad you're not watching.

1730
01:57:24,884 --> 01:57:25,504
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready for this?

1731
01:57:26,004 --> 01:57:29,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Best female performance, Kristen Stewart in Twilight, New Moon.

1732
01:57:30,368 --> 01:57:33,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Best male performance, Robert Pattinson in Twilight, New Moon.

1733
01:57:34,071 --> 01:57:35,412
[SPEAKER_05]: We're clearly not the demographic.

1734
01:57:35,432 --> 01:57:37,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Best movie, The Twilight Saga, New Moon.

1735
01:57:39,454 --> 01:57:42,856
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not the demographic for MTV anymore.

1736
01:57:42,896 --> 01:57:43,917
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to understand.

1737
01:57:43,997 --> 01:57:48,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the MTV we knew and loved is gone.

1738
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:49,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dead.

1739
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:50,941
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what Twilight needs?

1740
01:57:51,901 --> 01:57:52,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Simon Belmont.

1741
01:57:52,722 --> 01:57:53,682
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Twilight needs.

1742
01:57:55,615 --> 01:57:59,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, going on to some quick fire news and some other stuff that's coming out.

1743
01:58:00,241 --> 01:58:02,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band Weekly updates.

1744
01:58:02,484 --> 01:58:03,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Deftones are coming out.

1745
01:58:03,905 --> 01:58:04,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoop-dee-doo.

1746
01:58:04,807 --> 01:58:07,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Grown up in Sacramento, I've heard way too much Deftones.

1747
01:58:08,011 --> 01:58:09,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Cherry Waves, Hole in the Earth, and Minerva.

1748
01:58:09,893 --> 01:58:10,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoop-dee-whoop-dee.

1749
01:58:11,255 --> 01:58:33,256
[SPEAKER_05]: individual songs Boys Like Girls with The Great Escape and Crown of Thorns with Rock Ready I will be buying none of those songs but maybe you're interested I too will be buying none of those songs here's a game that might actually catch my interest maybe I will buy this it's a game called Hardcore Uprising Hard Corps but I think the P is silent when you say it like that Hardcore Uprising

1750
01:58:34,096 --> 01:58:36,697
[SPEAKER_05]: for Xbox Live Arcade and PSN.

1751
01:58:36,717 --> 01:58:38,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And why am I interested in this game?

1752
01:58:38,078 --> 01:58:41,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently it's a spiritual successor to Contra.

1753
01:58:41,539 --> 01:58:42,720
[SPEAKER_05]: It plays like Contra.

1754
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:43,960
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels like Contra.

1755
01:58:44,040 --> 01:58:44,780
[SPEAKER_05]: It's high def.

1756
01:58:44,881 --> 01:58:45,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It's side-scroller.

1757
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:46,501
[SPEAKER_05]: It's guns.

1758
01:58:47,001 --> 01:58:49,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't have Contra in it.

1759
01:58:49,622 --> 01:58:54,244
[SPEAKER_06]: But the game looks awesome because it's done by Axis, I think.

1760
01:58:54,364 --> 01:58:55,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not Axis...

1761
01:58:57,985 --> 01:58:59,526
[SPEAKER_06]: The people that did it are like, please blue.

1762
01:58:59,606 --> 01:59:00,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's all hand-drawn stuff.

1763
01:59:00,906 --> 01:59:01,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks awesome.

1764
01:59:01,606 --> 01:59:05,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you might remember there was a Genesis game called Contra Hard Corps.

1765
01:59:05,347 --> 01:59:07,447
[SPEAKER_05]: This is apparently a successor to that game.

1766
01:59:07,507 --> 01:59:10,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But for whatever reason, they've just decided not to call it Contra.

1767
01:59:10,548 --> 01:59:14,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they just didn't want people to know what this game was.

1768
01:59:14,449 --> 01:59:15,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

1769
01:59:16,689 --> 01:59:17,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It still looks cool.

1770
01:59:18,129 --> 01:59:18,609
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

1771
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1772
01:59:21,775 --> 01:59:23,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Arc System Works, apparently.

1773
01:59:23,337 --> 01:59:25,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Arc System Works, that's what I was thinking.

1774
01:59:25,741 --> 01:59:29,346
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will be beautifully animated, that's for sure.

1775
01:59:32,082 --> 01:59:32,362
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1776
01:59:32,842 --> 01:59:36,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming out, Earthworm Jim HD.

1777
01:59:36,063 --> 01:59:37,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently that is the big release next week.

1778
01:59:38,624 --> 01:59:40,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Also some deals.

1779
01:59:40,624 --> 01:59:42,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Worms 2 is getting a price reduction.

1780
01:59:42,245 --> 01:59:44,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Peggle goes down to 400 points.

1781
01:59:44,485 --> 01:59:46,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke Nukem 3D is down to 400 points.

1782
01:59:46,326 --> 01:59:47,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to finally pick that up.

1783
01:59:48,346 --> 01:59:50,367
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, lots of good deals on Xbox Live next week.

1784
01:59:50,427 --> 01:59:53,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, Earthworm Jim, or as the intro says, Earthworm Jim.

1785
01:59:54,008 --> 01:59:54,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a little burping thing.

1786
01:59:55,608 --> 01:59:57,989
[SPEAKER_05]: HD comes out on this Wednesday, June the 9th.

1787
01:59:58,149 --> 02:00:01,474
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's going to be awesome because you can play four person co-op.

1788
02:00:01,555 --> 02:00:02,116
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1789
02:00:02,496 --> 02:00:02,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be fun.

1790
02:00:04,119 --> 02:00:04,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So there it is.

1791
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:09,407
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple stories about things coming out very soon on the downloadable platforms.

1792
02:00:10,048 --> 02:00:10,489
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1793
02:00:11,098 --> 02:00:38,594
[SPEAKER_03]: and other news Sony Online Entertainment has actually released some information about PlayStation 3 and PC MMO for DC Universe Online but they really haven't said too much more about it there's no real release date but they said that both versions will come out at the same time it's likely to be in November which actually is what they finally came out and said

1794
02:00:41,276 --> 02:00:43,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool, I guess.

1795
02:00:43,536 --> 02:00:46,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how it'll play, but hey.

1796
02:00:47,498 --> 02:01:01,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the voice actor Phil Snyder, who we better know as the voice of Jiminy Cricket, is working on an unannounced project called Kingdom Hearts Recoded.

1797
02:01:03,084 --> 02:01:07,626
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that... But that's...

1798
02:01:10,012 --> 02:01:32,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Likely a sequel to the mobile game, the mobile phone game, Kingdom Hearts Coded Could be a redrawn, you know, an upscaled version or ported too Could be You know, when you're going from mobile phone to PSP, you expect things are going to be upgraded quite a bit Not really I would hope so Could be an iPhone title

1799
02:01:33,354 --> 02:01:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that could be too.

1800
02:01:34,455 --> 02:01:35,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how I feel about that.

1801
02:01:36,596 --> 02:01:49,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've had some more Sims titles, domains actually being registered by corporate domains.

1802
02:01:51,264 --> 02:01:52,145
[SPEAKER_03]: There are...

1803
02:01:54,466 --> 02:02:11,384
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sims Medieval or The Sims Get Medieval so could possibly be old school jousting sims with chamber pots and chastity belts and tight lacing and

1804
02:02:12,084 --> 02:02:15,447
[SPEAKER_06]: What if they have it where you can design your castles and stuff like that?

1805
02:02:16,908 --> 02:02:21,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not that you can't design castles and add motes, because hell, I was doing that in Sims 1.

1806
02:02:22,571 --> 02:02:24,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the motes part.

1807
02:02:24,213 --> 02:02:28,415
[SPEAKER_03]: They've actually got out a Ren Faire set officially through the Sims store.

1808
02:02:28,856 --> 02:02:36,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Mod the Sims, which is one of the mod sites I go through, they actually did a medieval challenge.

1809
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:38,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Outro Outro Outro

1810
02:03:03,982 --> 02:03:05,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I've seen that movie.

1811

[SPEAKER_05]: 1987 called.

02:03:07,164 --> 02:03:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It misses you.

1814
02:03:08,545 --> 02:03:09,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got it right.

1815
02:03:12,187 --> 02:03:12,567
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1816
02:03:13,587 --> 02:03:14,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1817
02:03:14,288 --> 02:03:16,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am the Duke of Ted.

1818
02:03:16,229 --> 02:03:17,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1819
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:19,671
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura is a freaking nerd.

1820
02:03:19,951 --> 02:03:20,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So?

1821
02:03:21,632 --> 02:03:22,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd.

1822
02:03:22,212 --> 02:03:23,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we love you.

1823
02:03:23,153 --> 02:03:23,893
[SPEAKER_05]: You nerd.

1824
02:03:24,493 --> 02:03:24,814
[SPEAKER_04]: So?

1825
02:03:25,274 --> 02:03:25,614
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1826
02:03:26,034 --> 02:03:28,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you're just a nerdy nerd.

1827
02:03:28,176 --> 02:03:28,536
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

1828
02:03:30,242 --> 02:03:34,503
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to get into a segment here on the show we like to call the Twitter Topics.

1829
02:03:35,524 --> 02:03:37,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm missing the theme music for Twitter Topics.

1830
02:03:37,484 --> 02:03:39,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we do Twitter Topics with no theme music?

1831
02:03:40,045 --> 02:03:40,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we?

1832
02:03:40,825 --> 02:03:41,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1833
02:03:42,726 --> 02:03:43,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1834
02:03:43,086 --> 02:03:44,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have like music?

1835
02:03:44,486 --> 02:03:46,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to sing the theme music?

1836
02:03:46,927 --> 02:03:47,227
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1837
02:03:47,507 --> 02:03:48,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're saved anyway.

1838
02:03:48,408 --> 02:03:48,828
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it.

1839
02:03:50,228 --> 02:03:52,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We call stretching for time while I look for stuff for Twitter Topics.

1840
02:03:53,049 --> 02:03:54,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of tweets tonight.

1841
02:03:54,869 --> 02:03:58,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm frowning with disappointment at our listeners.

1842
02:03:58,230 --> 02:03:59,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's my frown to all of you.

1843
02:04:01,803 --> 02:04:02,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, uh...

1844
02:04:05,228 --> 02:04:08,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, lots of plugs for articles on the website.

1845
02:04:08,911 --> 02:04:10,011
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I got those in earlier.

1846
02:04:10,412 --> 02:04:13,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Noir sent his condolences to the Golden Girl loving crew.

1847
02:04:14,034 --> 02:04:18,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess we didn't really talk about this enough earlier in the show, but there was a lot of celebrity death, obviously.

1848
02:04:18,777 --> 02:04:21,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't buy the whole death comes in threes things.

1849
02:04:21,739 --> 02:04:24,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people just look for coincidences wherever they want to.

1850
02:04:25,522 --> 02:04:29,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Because didn't, like, Art Link let her die, too, and nobody cares about him, though, so whatever.

1851
02:04:30,085 --> 02:04:31,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm saying, you know.

1852
02:04:31,065 --> 02:04:31,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gary Coleman.

1853
02:04:32,486 --> 02:04:34,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, who technically does have a video game tie-in.

1854
02:04:35,509 --> 02:04:37,535
[SPEAKER_05]: He was in Portal 2, er, it's Portal 2.

1855
02:04:39,116 --> 02:04:40,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Postal 2.

1856
02:04:40,356 --> 02:04:41,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Much different.

1857
02:04:41,737 --> 02:04:43,297
[SPEAKER_05]: He still could be in Portal 2.

1858
02:04:43,677 --> 02:04:49,619
[SPEAKER_03]: More importantly, he's in Avenue Q. Drew McClanahan, of course.

1859
02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:50,859
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

1860
02:04:50,919 --> 02:04:51,519
[SPEAKER_03]: The man.

1861
02:04:52,540 --> 02:04:53,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Our zombie man, Dennis Hopper.

1862
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:59,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I put on my Facebook that Dennis Hopper was going to come back as a zombie riding a motorcycle.

1863
02:04:59,842 --> 02:05:02,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't he an easy rider?

1864
02:05:02,182 --> 02:05:02,642
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrote it.

1865
02:05:03,923 --> 02:05:04,463
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.

1866
02:05:04,483 --> 02:05:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: That was his big movie in all the Romero flicks.

1867
02:05:08,705 --> 02:05:13,246
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think my uncle added on there that Gary Coleman would be in the sidecar.

1868
02:05:14,781 --> 02:05:16,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Predator used Call of Duty to coerce kids into sending nude pics.

1869
02:05:44,505 --> 02:05:59,508
[SPEAKER_05]: A New Jersey man convinced four 13 and 14-year-olds to send him pictures of their genitals by saying that it was a membership condition of the clan he was starting in Call of Duty World of War.

1870
02:06:00,228 --> 02:06:06,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonathan Prime is 20 years old and faces four felony counts of communication with a minor for immoral purposes.

1871
02:06:06,890 --> 02:06:12,571
[SPEAKER_05]: He also has a previous conviction on a child porn charge related to this case in his home state.

1872
02:06:14,619 --> 02:06:18,881
[SPEAKER_05]: He's in jail on a $25,000 bond and all this stuff.

1873
02:06:20,321 --> 02:06:26,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Kids, don't send pictures of your penis over Xbox Live ever.

1874
02:06:26,384 --> 02:06:29,625
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't really send pictures of your penis anywhere.

1875
02:06:30,265 --> 02:06:31,266
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me tell you why.

1876
02:06:32,346 --> 02:06:33,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets bigger.

1877
02:06:35,927 --> 02:06:38,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Until when do you stop growing like 23 or something?

1878
02:06:38,548 --> 02:06:40,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just wait.

1879
02:06:41,069 --> 02:06:42,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait until you're fully matured.

1880
02:06:44,008 --> 02:06:45,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's gross.

1881
02:06:45,169 --> 02:06:45,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

1882
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:46,811
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the real reason.

1883
02:06:46,851 --> 02:06:47,791
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't do that.

1884
02:06:48,432 --> 02:06:51,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't send pictures of your dongle over the internet.

1885
02:06:52,195 --> 02:06:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1886
02:06:54,357 --> 02:06:54,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1887
02:06:55,198 --> 02:06:58,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Meow Frog sent us some tweets saying, First time listening to OLR Live.

1888
02:06:58,861 --> 02:06:59,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, welcome.

1889
02:06:59,822 --> 02:07:02,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's the chat for OLR?

1890
02:07:02,084 --> 02:07:04,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I saw Meow Frog in chat earlier, so I know they made it to chat.

1891
02:07:04,947 --> 02:07:10,932
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com for anyone else who is listening and wanting to know how to join us in our chat room.

1892
02:07:11,492 --> 02:07:17,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, although if you ask in the all games chat, um, they'll probably tell you how to get over there too.

1893
02:07:19,258 --> 02:07:19,558
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1894
02:07:20,779 --> 02:07:21,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

1895
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:23,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, what else do we have?

1896
02:07:23,521 --> 02:07:24,561
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's about it.

1897
02:07:24,742 --> 02:07:27,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, except Jay, I hope I'm saying this right.

1898
02:07:27,323 --> 02:07:27,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Jay Jugo.

1899
02:07:27,824 --> 02:07:30,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I hope it's not Hugo.

1900
02:07:30,406 --> 02:07:34,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Jay Jugo says, uh, the never forget segment should be added to the show.

1901
02:07:34,328 --> 02:07:35,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Never forget.

1902
02:07:35,309 --> 02:07:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not sure how to make that like a piece of the show.

1903
02:07:41,069 --> 02:07:45,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Loomis sends us a tweet saying, OLR, will you be going to BlizzCon Sky?

1904
02:07:45,357 --> 02:07:46,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to buy you a drink.

1905
02:07:46,740 --> 02:07:47,201
[SPEAKER_05]: No homo.

1906
02:07:49,767 --> 02:07:52,989
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura and I are, we're thinking about just going down to Anaheim anyway, if finances will allow.

1907
02:07:53,169 --> 02:07:55,310
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go down to Anaheim anyway and just go to Disneyland.

1908
02:08:17,766 --> 02:08:19,268
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be called UsCon.

1909
02:08:19,608 --> 02:08:19,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1910
02:08:20,489 --> 02:08:23,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can buy us a drink there, I suppose.

1911
02:08:23,111 --> 02:08:23,511
[SPEAKER_05]: No homo.

1912
02:08:26,935 --> 02:08:27,515
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Rob.

1913
02:08:27,615 --> 02:08:27,795
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1914
02:08:28,716 --> 02:08:32,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to describe to somebody what the difference between girly and gay was.

1915
02:08:33,621 --> 02:08:34,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

1916
02:08:34,401 --> 02:08:35,062
[SPEAKER_03]: In decorating.

1917
02:08:37,914 --> 02:08:40,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I just cannot even possibly understand.

1918
02:08:41,458 --> 02:08:41,718
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1919
02:08:42,298 --> 02:08:42,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

1920
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:43,399
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for tweets.

1921
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:45,261
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get a lot of tweets tonight.

1922
02:08:45,281 --> 02:08:47,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we got, I mean, TigerClaw sent us other stories.

1923
02:08:47,043 --> 02:08:48,184
[SPEAKER_05]: There are things that are coming up later.

1924
02:08:48,264 --> 02:08:53,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we appreciate his Google foo, but I don't want to spoil upcoming stories.

1925
02:08:55,356 --> 02:08:58,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, how about some other topics we want to talk about tonight?

1926
02:08:58,557 --> 02:08:58,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki!

1927
02:08:59,717 --> 02:09:09,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, let's talk about how Parappa the Rapper, well, the creator of Parappa the Rapper, is putting out a new music game for the iPhone and iPod.

1928
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:11,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks interesting, I guess.

1929
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:18,661
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called, looks like Winta, or War is Not the Answer.

1930
02:09:19,761 --> 02:09:20,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's...

1931
02:09:22,748 --> 02:09:23,188
[SPEAKER_06]: War.

1932
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:24,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

1933
02:09:24,469 --> 02:09:25,370
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it good for?

1934
02:09:27,491 --> 02:09:27,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Butter.

1935
02:09:28,592 --> 02:09:32,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah.

1936
02:09:34,036 --> 02:09:41,902
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't really say what exactly the game is going to be like, but it's basically tapping squares on a screen to time with music.

1937
02:09:42,502 --> 02:09:49,627
[SPEAKER_06]: So, kind of looks a little bit like it could be similar to Elite Beat Agents or something like that.

1938
02:09:49,687 --> 02:09:51,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the art done by Mr. Greenblatt?

1939
02:09:52,432 --> 02:09:53,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1940
02:10:09,098 --> 02:10:09,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

1941
02:10:09,819 --> 02:10:14,300
[SPEAKER_05]: How about a new, like, actual, like, Parappa or Umjama Lamy type game?

1942
02:10:14,340 --> 02:10:21,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, tell me that, like, Xbox Live or PlayStation Network, I suppose, more appropriately, would not be, like, the perfect platform for a game like that.

1943
02:10:21,583 --> 02:10:22,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

1944
02:10:22,564 --> 02:10:23,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be cool.

1945
02:10:23,164 --> 02:10:24,704
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be awesome.

1946
02:10:25,785 --> 02:10:26,525
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta believe.

1947
02:10:27,005 --> 02:10:27,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Never gonna happen.

1948
02:10:27,686 --> 02:10:30,547
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the butter, you know where that comes from?

1949
02:10:31,107 --> 02:10:32,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that from... Cheap Cheap's level?

1950
02:10:33,628 --> 02:10:37,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to just... For months, Dan and I would go around going, crack, crack, butter!

1951
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:40,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So he laughed in the other room.

1952
02:10:42,372 --> 02:10:42,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel happy.

1953
02:10:44,193 --> 02:10:49,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And Derek H. took my question literally, saying war saved us from the Nazis and war freed the slaves.

1954
02:10:49,655 --> 02:10:50,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I was singing a song.

1955
02:10:50,795 --> 02:10:52,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't... Forget it.

1956
02:10:52,676 --> 02:10:53,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alright.

1957
02:10:54,737 --> 02:10:55,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

1958
02:10:58,308 --> 02:11:03,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Could Sony possibly be planning more PS2 remakes?

1959
02:11:04,591 --> 02:11:07,913
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you know, they did the God of War remakes earlier.

1960
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:09,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

1961
02:11:09,434 --> 02:11:11,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a survey going around again.

1962
02:11:11,515 --> 02:11:12,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's right.

1963
02:11:12,255 --> 02:11:14,697
[SPEAKER_05]: The surveys sometimes leak things that Sony are thinking.

1964
02:11:14,977 --> 02:11:15,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Survey says?

1965
02:11:19,096 --> 02:11:20,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you didn't see that joke coming.

1966
02:11:20,696 --> 02:11:25,557
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things on the survey, well, the survey said, What titles would you like to see in a future collection?

1967
02:11:25,717 --> 02:11:30,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Two or more PS2 titles upgraded with similar features to God of War Collection.

1968
02:11:31,418 --> 02:11:40,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like this because there's this little screenshot that shows, like, Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, Gran Turismo, Final Fantasy, Yakuza, Silent Hill.

1969
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:44,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, just every single freaking franchise is being listed in there.

1970
02:11:44,221 --> 02:11:44,641
[SPEAKER_05]: But, uh...

1971
02:11:45,643 --> 02:11:46,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me Twisted Metal!

1972
02:12:04,448 --> 02:12:09,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize, yes, there's that first generation of consoles that does have it, but most of us don't have it.

1973
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,370
[SPEAKER_06]: The better consoles?

1974
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:14,732
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all figured that they would end up selling it at some point, but I don't know.

1975
02:12:14,772 --> 02:12:17,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there's something missing here.

1976
02:12:18,633 --> 02:12:24,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm one of those douchebags that has the fully backwards compatible system and doesn't play any PlayStation 2 games on it.

1977
02:12:24,275 --> 02:12:25,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, congratulations, douchebag.

1978
02:12:26,036 --> 02:12:26,896
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to trade PS3s?

1979
02:12:26,916 --> 02:12:28,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I could sure play Final Fantasy XII.

1980
02:12:29,017 --> 02:12:29,097
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1981
02:12:31,838 --> 02:12:34,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever upgrade your PS3 to lose the other OS feature?

1982
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:35,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1983
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:36,601
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still holding out, huh?

1984
02:12:36,641 --> 02:12:37,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Still holding out.

1985
02:12:37,542 --> 02:12:42,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't played 3D Dot Game Heroes 2 because that would upgrade my system.

1986
02:12:43,065 --> 02:12:43,926
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm loaning it to a friend.

1987
02:12:44,406 --> 02:12:48,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Toagak in our chatroom says, very eloquently, fuck PS2 remakes.

1988
02:12:49,930 --> 02:12:51,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, are they necessary?

1989
02:12:51,831 --> 02:12:53,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe he's posing a good question there.

1990
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:55,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this really necessary?

1991
02:12:55,413 --> 02:12:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1992
02:12:55,874 --> 02:12:57,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the God of War collection was pretty cool, though.

1993
02:12:58,035 --> 02:13:00,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, HD, widescreen, sexy...

1994
02:13:02,111 --> 02:13:06,272
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya thinks she should be a game show host, by the way.

1995
02:13:06,312 --> 02:13:06,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Me?

1996
02:13:06,392 --> 02:13:06,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1997
02:13:28,860 --> 02:13:30,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Make, edit, get porn

1998
02:13:57,645 --> 02:13:59,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I got second place in that, didn't I?

1999
02:14:00,386 --> 02:14:01,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember as long as I remember.

2000
02:14:01,386 --> 02:14:02,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I placed in it.

2001
02:14:02,186 --> 02:14:02,706
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I did.

2002
02:14:02,726 --> 02:14:04,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you and I both placed.

2003
02:14:04,467 --> 02:14:17,130
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was where basically you would make an edit to a DDR song because back in the day you could make edits in the home version of DDR and put them in the machines and Loki's favorite edits would receive a free gift of pornography.

2004
02:14:17,150 --> 02:14:17,970
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the hell edits.

2005
02:14:18,210 --> 02:14:18,630
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

2006
02:14:19,471 --> 02:14:20,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was called Make Edit Get Porn.

2007
02:14:21,011 --> 02:14:22,671
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the best contest the station's ever had.

2008
02:14:22,691 --> 02:14:24,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the DXY version called Another.

2009
02:14:25,467 --> 02:14:26,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I got all that XL Saga

2010
02:14:50,393 --> 02:14:51,954
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2011
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:17,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, is he still alive?

2012
02:15:19,092 --> 02:15:21,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is he still fapping right now?

2013
02:15:22,214 --> 02:15:22,654
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2014
02:15:23,915 --> 02:15:25,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

2015
02:15:25,075 --> 02:15:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what you got for us?

2016
02:15:26,436 --> 02:15:26,836
[SPEAKER_05]: More news.

2017
02:15:27,436 --> 02:15:28,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, more news.

2018
02:15:29,077 --> 02:15:32,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, Rob, I'm honestly going to have to ask you your help with the mailbag today.

2019
02:15:32,879 --> 02:15:34,780
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya is pointing out, that's fine, I'll do my mailbag.

2020
02:15:35,020 --> 02:15:39,803
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya is pointing out that that highlight is on the best hits that you can download at OrangeLondrina.com.

2021
02:15:41,897 --> 02:15:42,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So check it.

2022
02:15:43,779 --> 02:15:52,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is something about Activision working on a GoldenEye title for the Wii and the DS to be released in November.

2023
02:15:53,448 --> 02:15:59,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's theorized to be a remake of the Nintendo 64 version that Rare put out.

2024
02:15:59,636 --> 02:16:01,316
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2025
02:16:29,935 --> 02:16:57,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Activision is working on a James Bond game a GoldenEye title, Rob and it's supposed to be out for Wii and the DS in theory released in November one of the going rumors about it is that it will be a remake of the Nintendo 64 version which as we all know is epic, classic, the game the game made me sick sick to my stomach Perfect Dark was redone recently and it was pretty awesome

2026
02:16:58,723 --> 02:17:18,829
[SPEAKER_03]: that's true but Activision basically let it off at the point that they registered domain names that were named after the film so we might see that coming they also did work on The World is Not Enough right?

2027
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:27,752
[SPEAKER_06]: they've done the last few Bond films they have the rights to do the games for them

2028
02:17:28,835 --> 02:17:35,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, if they bring us out a remade Goldeneye, that'll be pretty hot.

2029
02:17:36,221 --> 02:17:36,842
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gonna be fun.

2030
02:17:36,982 --> 02:17:37,543
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

2031
02:17:37,583 --> 02:17:39,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it'll be as good as the original.

2032
02:17:39,304 --> 02:17:40,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just the problem.

2033
02:17:40,225 --> 02:17:41,886
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, nothing is really as ever good as the original.

2034
02:17:42,167 --> 02:17:44,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anything's gonna accurately capture the magic of the original.

2035
02:17:45,319 --> 02:17:46,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I beg to differ.

2036
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:56,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as I said in part A, when Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes came out on the GameCube, it was a fairly kick-ass version.

2037
02:17:57,605 --> 02:18:05,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't forget the Resident Evil update where they did Resident Evil on GameCube and it was really hot.

2038
02:18:05,950 --> 02:18:07,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'll give you that.

2039
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:09,311
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been remakes done right.

2040
02:18:09,751 --> 02:18:10,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we'll see.

2041
02:18:10,472 --> 02:18:12,613
[SPEAKER_03]: They just have to make sure to stick with the essence of the game.

2042
02:18:13,195 --> 02:18:14,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2043
02:18:14,636 --> 02:18:18,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to remind folks, sometimes we can't control the downtime of the feed.

2044
02:18:18,660 --> 02:18:22,083
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just random hiccups, although I like this comment from SSJ100Matt.

2045
02:18:22,403 --> 02:18:24,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of porn, who's watching it in studio?

2046
02:18:24,826 --> 02:18:26,467
[SPEAKER_05]: He said right as the feed went down.

2047
02:18:26,727 --> 02:18:27,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me.

2048
02:18:28,329 --> 02:18:29,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's comcastic.

2049
02:18:29,750 --> 02:18:30,371
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

2050
02:18:30,391 --> 02:18:31,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens sometimes.

2051
02:18:32,071 --> 02:18:35,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, let's move on with a few more news stories.

2052
02:18:35,413 --> 02:18:36,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to get to the mailbag.

2053
02:18:36,934 --> 02:18:38,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

2054
02:18:38,435 --> 02:18:40,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We answer your emails live on air.

2055
02:18:40,377 --> 02:18:40,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

2056
02:18:41,077 --> 02:18:41,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2057
02:18:44,099 --> 02:18:44,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Horse.

2058
02:18:45,140 --> 02:18:45,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

2059
02:18:46,681 --> 02:18:53,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently there's been some ratings that have leaked out from the Korean ratings board.

2060
02:18:53,665 --> 02:18:57,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are some Dreamcast titles that are going to be ported to Xbox Live Arcade.

2061
02:18:57,868 --> 02:19:04,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi have been submitted for ratings.

2062
02:19:04,632 --> 02:19:08,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega was unable to officially comment on the ratings.

2063
02:19:08,834 --> 02:19:10,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic Adventure has popped up before.

2064
02:19:12,776 --> 02:19:16,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they had some screenshots leak out a little bit ago.

2065
02:19:17,638 --> 02:19:19,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Taxi, I think the same thing.

2066
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:24,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I know or anything, but Sonic Adventure is most definitely real.

2067
02:19:25,884 --> 02:19:27,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Taxi is probably the same.

2068
02:19:28,586 --> 02:19:30,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I would not be surprised if these get announced at E3.

2069
02:19:32,958 --> 02:19:36,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think there's a chance they're going to come out and say, and they're out today!

2070
02:19:36,160 --> 02:19:37,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that happens once in a while.

2071
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:40,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic Adventure's done, so yeah, I could see that.

2072
02:19:40,082 --> 02:19:41,082
[SPEAKER_05]: You could see that happening.

2073
02:19:41,102 --> 02:19:42,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been done for a while.

2074
02:19:42,043 --> 02:19:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely could see that happening, huh?

2075
02:19:43,484 --> 02:19:45,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Same as Sonic 4, but they're taking their damn time.

2076
02:19:46,185 --> 02:19:46,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2077
02:19:47,886 --> 02:19:52,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on with some more news, and then I guess I'm going to do the mailbag tonight.

2078
02:19:52,148 --> 02:19:53,989
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's not feeling up to it.

2079
02:19:54,189 --> 02:19:56,350
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my voice has finally decided to crap out.

2080
02:19:56,750 --> 02:19:58,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance on Broadway 20 songs from Broadway musicals

2081
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:42,731
[SPEAKER_05]: All That Jazz, Roxy, Cabaret, Money Money, Dream Girls, One Night Only, Luck Be a Lady, Lullaby of Broadway, You Can't Stop the Beat, Good Morning Baltimore, Fame, My Favorite Things, Bend and Snap, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Little Shop of Horrors,

2082
02:20:43,772 --> 02:20:49,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Aquarius, Let the Sunshine In, and, and, and, and, the Time Warp.

2083
02:20:52,517 --> 02:20:53,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to say woo.

2084
02:20:53,517 --> 02:20:56,519
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's making woo face right now, but you can't hear her.

2085
02:20:57,199 --> 02:20:59,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I already know how to do the Time Warp.

2086
02:20:59,460 --> 02:21:03,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the right.

2087
02:21:03,643 --> 02:21:05,083
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is supposed to be like Just Dance.

2088
02:21:05,704 --> 02:21:07,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much a sequel to Just Dance, right?

2089
02:21:07,785 --> 02:21:09,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, except they're going to have Just Dance too.

2090
02:21:10,703 --> 02:21:13,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's like Guitar Hero 80s edition.

2091
02:21:13,745 --> 02:21:17,827
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just dance, super duper gay edition.

2092
02:21:17,987 --> 02:21:20,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's okay.

2093
02:21:20,348 --> 02:21:21,549
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with that.

2094
02:21:21,809 --> 02:21:25,191
[SPEAKER_03]: This actually reminds me that people need to stay tuned for Cage Match tonight.

2095
02:21:26,592 --> 02:21:27,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of show tunes.

2096
02:21:27,352 --> 02:21:28,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh heavens, why is that?

2097
02:21:29,633 --> 02:21:30,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of show tunes.

2098
02:21:32,179 --> 02:21:33,080
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2099
02:21:54,540 --> 02:21:58,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, in the meantime, we're going to do something we can do on the podcast and live.

2100
02:21:58,444 --> 02:21:59,946
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to do this segment every week.

2101
02:22:00,506 --> 02:22:02,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the mailbag.

2102
02:22:10,156 --> 02:22:12,458
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link in our chatroom says, nothing from Wicked.

2103
02:22:12,658 --> 02:22:13,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Fail.

2104
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:15,721
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I actually don't like Wicked.

2105
02:22:15,981 --> 02:22:16,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2106
02:22:16,322 --> 02:22:17,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

2107
02:22:17,463 --> 02:22:18,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, because I read the book.

2108
02:22:20,324 --> 02:22:26,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't listen to this as a musical because the book was so dark and gorgeous.

2109
02:22:26,946 --> 02:22:27,186
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2110
02:22:27,566 --> 02:22:33,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see the emails because there's a lot tonight because we kind of have a backlog from all the shows that we didn't do the past couple weeks.

2111
02:22:33,607 --> 02:22:39,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to start off tonight with this one from... Oh, that's a spam email that came in.

2112
02:22:41,908 --> 02:22:44,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do... I don't see...

2113
02:22:47,699 --> 02:23:02,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Redertainment Dear OLR, I was listening to your midweek discussion of the inclusion of a keytar in the next rock band game and a thought came to my mind.

2114
02:23:03,431 --> 02:23:09,716
[SPEAKER_05]: If this keytar is a plastic instrument with the keys in the body instead of the neck, isn't that like playing the plastic guitar backward?

2115
02:23:10,337 --> 02:23:15,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean playing it left-handed, but playing the guitar turned 180 degrees with the keys on your lap?

2116
02:23:16,201 --> 02:23:27,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, it seems to me that every numbered version of Rock Band gives the gaming public another gaming-related plastic dust magnet that is incompatible with other games, but gamers feel compelled to buy to play the game.

2117
02:23:28,208 --> 02:23:29,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band gave us a guitar.

2118
02:23:29,828 --> 02:23:32,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band 2 gave us a complete band set.

2119
02:23:32,390 --> 02:23:34,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Rock Band 3 will give us a keytar.

2120
02:23:35,111 --> 02:23:36,672
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me wonder... I know, hold on.

2121
02:23:36,712 --> 02:23:37,613
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a correction there.

2122
02:23:37,933 --> 02:23:41,755
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me wonder what useless plastic space hog Rock Band 4 will bring us.

2123
02:23:41,975 --> 02:23:43,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I vote for maracas.

2124
02:23:43,236 --> 02:23:43,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

2125
02:23:44,396 --> 02:23:45,577
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2126
02:24:02,933 --> 02:24:03,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

2127
02:24:20,239 --> 02:24:20,499
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's fine.

2128
02:24:20,519 --> 02:24:20,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2129
02:24:50,943 --> 02:24:58,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, our good buddy Rob with two B's, Rob-a-ba-ba-ba, sends us some impressions on Prince of Persia.

2130
02:24:59,687 --> 02:25:04,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Says, my boyfriend is a non-gamer, but he really enjoyed the Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.

2131
02:25:04,208 --> 02:25:05,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was fun to watch, too.

2132
02:25:05,809 --> 02:25:09,851
[SPEAKER_05]: The criticism that Jake Gyllenhaal was too Caucasian for the role were unfounded.

2133
02:25:10,311 --> 02:25:13,392
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because the other two princes in the movie were whiter.

2134
02:25:17,054 --> 02:25:17,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny.

2135
02:25:18,275 --> 02:25:21,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, another thing I'm surprised I'm not hearing a lot of comment on this week.

2136
02:25:21,457 --> 02:25:22,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, did you happen to see the movie?

2137
02:25:23,178 --> 02:25:23,598
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2138
02:25:23,898 --> 02:25:24,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't bother either.

2139
02:25:25,859 --> 02:25:31,983
[SPEAKER_06]: The only movie I watched this week is not out yet, so obviously not legally.

2140
02:25:33,003 --> 02:25:37,346
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was a good movie, and hopefully it will come out over here at some point, but it's just not yet.

2141
02:25:37,819 --> 02:25:40,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Robway continues,

2142
02:25:53,866 --> 02:25:57,248
[SPEAKER_05]: There doesn't seem to be as much pressure to replay levels for Starz either.

2143
02:25:57,669 --> 02:26:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious to hear your thoughts on the game, especially after hearing the Super Mario 64 classic as the game of the week.

2144
02:26:03,393 --> 02:26:06,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Tune in to a future episode when one of us has actually played the damn game.

2145
02:26:06,975 --> 02:26:08,676
[SPEAKER_05]: But my Wii's just not hooked up right now.

2146
02:26:08,696 --> 02:26:11,478
[SPEAKER_06]: My Wii's semi-bricked from New Super Mario Bros.

2147
02:26:11,618 --> 02:26:13,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Blur and these other games.

2148
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:14,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2149
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Your Wii got bricked?

2150
02:26:15,361 --> 02:26:16,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Semi-bricked.

2151
02:26:16,302 --> 02:26:16,822
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that mean?

2152
02:26:17,182 --> 02:26:20,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Semi-bricked is when you play a game of a different region on your system.

2153
02:26:21,164 --> 02:26:23,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happens is a second update gets put in there.

2154
02:26:24,106 --> 02:26:30,069
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now I can play games on it, but I can't go into the system menu and change settings.

2155
02:26:31,170 --> 02:26:32,010
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to fix it.

2156
02:26:32,190 --> 02:26:34,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been so lazy to fix it.

2157
02:26:34,252 --> 02:26:37,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't care, to be honest.

2158
02:26:37,813 --> 02:26:43,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been too busy playing other games to actually go and play New Super Mario Bros.

2159
02:26:43,977 --> 02:26:44,957
[SPEAKER_06]: or Super Mario Galaxy 2.

2160
02:26:45,318 --> 02:26:45,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

2161
02:26:47,239 --> 02:26:48,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't feel compelled to do so.

2162
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:51,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it's super awesome.

2163
02:26:52,062 --> 02:26:54,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just... I don't know.

2164
02:26:55,024 --> 02:26:56,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Although my Trade Other M looks pretty nice.

2165
02:26:57,085 --> 02:27:00,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched a new video of that this week and it looks pretty cool.

2166
02:27:01,388 --> 02:27:01,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Metroid Other M?

2167
02:27:26,787 --> 02:27:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Too Good Prince of Persia is an average movie, but that means it's like the moon landing for video game movies One small step for man, one giant leap for video game movies to not be a turd of shit

2168
02:27:50,482 --> 02:27:54,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the turd is now a measurement of shit as opposed to just being another name.

2169
02:27:54,183 --> 02:27:54,423
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2170
02:27:54,643 --> 02:27:55,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was the Keurig.

2171
02:27:56,524 --> 02:27:56,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

2172
02:27:57,524 --> 02:27:58,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

2173
02:27:59,785 --> 02:28:02,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Another email from Rob that I want to bring up here.

2174
02:28:02,706 --> 02:28:06,227
[SPEAKER_05]: He's suggesting that we should play the 369 music from Schoolhouse Rock for the show.

2175
02:28:06,387 --> 02:28:06,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2176
02:28:06,968 --> 02:28:07,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have it queued up.

2177
02:28:07,748 --> 02:28:08,048
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

2178
02:28:08,448 --> 02:28:36,436
[SPEAKER_05]: but I do want to address this other point in the email also two weeks ago I saw my first Tron-a-Rail in Disney World that's just what we called it but it turned out to be the official name for the decorated trains any sightings in Disneyland I don't believe they've redone the monorail as Tron I don't think they're planning to do that but you never know when it gets a little closer to the movie releases there was a rumor that the people mover with Tron was going to come back but I'm not holding my breath on that I think if it does it ain't happening this year

2179
02:28:37,156 --> 02:28:38,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, nothing at Disneyland yet.

2180
02:28:38,977 --> 02:28:42,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're all waiting on pins and needles that hopefully the PeopleMover will reopen.

2181
02:28:42,920 --> 02:28:49,244
[SPEAKER_05]: And also of note, not to turn this into a Disney podcast, but in about, what, one more month, Star Tours will close.

2182
02:28:49,864 --> 02:28:52,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And Star Tours is no longer going to be there.

2183
02:28:52,906 --> 02:28:53,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, big deal.

2184
02:28:53,346 --> 02:28:54,007
[SPEAKER_05]: In its current form.

2185
02:28:54,047 --> 02:28:58,490
[SPEAKER_05]: They're redoing it for... There's going to be a Star Wars 2.0 that comes out later.

2186
02:28:58,550 --> 02:29:02,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to make it all stupid in, like, the prequels, so whatever.

2187
02:29:02,572 --> 02:29:04,534
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's the pod race, I'm okay with that.

2188
02:29:04,774 --> 02:29:07,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the pod race, that's the rumor that it's a pod race ride now.

2189
02:29:07,956 --> 02:29:09,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And that might be kind of cool.

2190
02:29:09,798 --> 02:29:11,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully you get to run over Jar Jar Binks.

2191
02:29:11,879 --> 02:29:12,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.

2192
02:29:13,921 --> 02:29:16,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And if Greg Proops is still one of the commentators, that's also amazing.

2193
02:29:16,683 --> 02:29:17,844
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

2194
02:29:19,185 --> 02:29:21,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right, yeah, he was a commentator.

2195
02:29:21,285 --> 02:29:22,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he was one of the two heads.

2196
02:29:22,686 --> 02:29:23,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.

2197
02:29:24,086 --> 02:29:25,926
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it'd be funny, though.

2198
02:29:26,486 --> 02:29:30,147
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Robot Chicken and stuff, where they have all the Jar Jar Binks stuff.

2199
02:29:30,367 --> 02:29:35,508
[SPEAKER_06]: They should just make it look like it's going to be some sort of pod race.

2200
02:29:35,948 --> 02:29:40,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Lock the doors, and it's just all Jar Jar Binks talking to you for a good five minutes.

2201
02:29:41,369 --> 02:29:41,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

2202
02:29:41,889 --> 02:29:44,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Children would cry and run screaming away.

2203
02:29:44,670 --> 02:29:46,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I would complain that my day was not magical.

2204
02:29:48,021 --> 02:29:48,882
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not magical.

2205
02:29:49,242 --> 02:29:50,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not having a magical day now.

2206
02:29:53,106 --> 02:29:53,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

2207
02:29:54,668 --> 02:29:56,009
[SPEAKER_05]: This comes from Shook.

2208
02:29:58,393 --> 02:30:19,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Big S, Big K Hi OLR, I'm here for a rant Lately in zombie discussions or something similar People act like they know everything about shotguns and .44s etc When really they're from a big city and have been nowhere near a gun Except maybe in their little gang I'm not trying to sound like some country bumpkin But it really pisses me off when they act like know-it-alls What are your thoughts?

2209
02:30:22,210 --> 02:30:23,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make me bust out my Glock.

2210
02:30:23,692 --> 02:30:27,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anyone really wants to shoot somebody in the face.

2211
02:30:27,595 --> 02:30:31,018
[SPEAKER_05]: In Red Dead Redemption, it's just funny to see.

2212
02:30:31,358 --> 02:30:32,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?

2213
02:30:32,879 --> 02:30:33,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I am an adult.

2214
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:36,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand what is fiction and what is real.

2215
02:30:36,102 --> 02:30:39,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to go shoot someone in the face if it's going to kill them.

2216
02:30:39,845 --> 02:30:46,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will be the first to admit, I don't know the difference between all these different types of guns because I don't like guns and I would never own a gun.

2217
02:30:46,330 --> 02:30:46,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what guns?

2218
02:30:46,790 --> 02:30:47,491
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we talking about guns?

2219
02:30:47,851 --> 02:30:49,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Shotguns and 44s, etc.

2220
02:30:49,832 --> 02:30:51,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying I know everything about these guns.

2221
02:30:51,774 --> 02:30:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Not me specifically, but just people.

2222
02:30:54,135 --> 02:30:56,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait until I own a gun.

2223
02:30:56,917 --> 02:30:58,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not getting into this topic again.

2224
02:30:58,398 --> 02:31:00,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned a lot about guns from playing Airsoft.

2225
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:03,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a lot of the guns that they have out there are modeled.

2226
02:31:03,921 --> 02:31:05,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I can say, hey, that's an MP7.

2227
02:31:05,803 --> 02:31:06,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hey, that's a G36.

2228
02:31:06,403 --> 02:31:07,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of cool.

2229
02:31:11,246 --> 02:31:17,069
[SPEAKER_03]: you know how I learned about guns very well writing G.I.

2230
02:31:17,109 --> 02:31:24,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe fanfiction about 10 years ago I'm not joking 10 years ago I was writing G.I.

2231
02:31:24,033 --> 02:31:39,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe fanfiction and I did my research I have no interest in firing a gun that is not of the laser variety or the shooting range I still I do still want a Hello Kitty we should go out to the shooting range I want to go

2232
02:31:40,339 --> 02:31:41,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Our friend used to go down there.

2233
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:43,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to go with him, but he moved too soon.

2234
02:31:43,521 --> 02:31:44,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to take a picture of this.

2235
02:31:45,242 --> 02:31:46,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan got to shoot off a .50 caliber.

2236
02:31:48,324 --> 02:31:50,206
[SPEAKER_05]: One more, you guys, from Dragonboy69.

2237
02:31:50,546 --> 02:32:00,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if any of you might know why some games, specifically Vagrant Story and Breath of Fire 3, show up on the Japan and European PSN store, but not on the North American store.

2238
02:32:01,233 --> 02:32:02,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for any help you can provide.

2239
02:32:02,474 --> 02:32:03,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep up the great work.

2240
02:32:03,755 --> 02:32:06,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Vagrant Story sucked?

2241
02:32:06,817 --> 02:32:07,117
What?

2242
02:32:07,677 --> 02:32:32,288
[SPEAKER_05]: but wait here's the thing just sometimes it's a rights issue and Final Fantasy 9 I think is another big one right like it's showing up in other stores but not the current one just it's rights issues and sometimes timing and other things it's sometimes kind of complicated I think it has to do with the fact that sometimes different companies publish different games in different countries and that sometimes complicate things but I think Wikipedia keeps a pretty good list of what's available yeah it's true too

2243
02:32:32,748 --> 02:32:39,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm posting this picture up on the site of my Hello Kitty holding a .50 caliber shell.

2244
02:32:39,952 --> 02:32:46,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, too, it's sometimes just the ability for that company to be able to distribute the game in a timely manner.

2245
02:32:47,255 --> 02:32:57,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example, MorphX, which was a game that came out in Europe just recently, is actually region-coded for both Europe and the North American regions.

2246
02:32:57,880 --> 02:33:07,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in theory, you could actually release the game here and it would be just fine, but for whatever reason, you know, it may have not passed the ratings board yet, maybe they don't have enough...

2247
02:33:08,304 --> 02:33:11,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Manpower to actually duplicate the units that they need.

2248
02:33:11,667 --> 02:33:24,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these companies, like Graffiti Entertainment or Zoo Games and stuff, their titles go for sometimes years of delays before they're actually released.

2249
02:33:25,236 --> 02:33:26,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.

2250
02:33:26,997 --> 02:33:27,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Graffiti Entertainment.

2251
02:33:28,318 --> 02:33:29,579
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for our mailbag.

2252
02:33:29,659 --> 02:33:33,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com If you'd like to send us an email, please do.

2253
02:33:33,381 --> 02:33:35,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2254
02:33:36,306 --> 02:33:39,849
[SPEAKER_05]: After the Mailbag is usually the section of the show where we get a little irritated.

2255
02:33:40,510 --> 02:33:43,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do a little segment on the show called the FUs of the Week.

2256
02:33:43,913 --> 02:33:44,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

2257
02:33:44,914 --> 02:33:45,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we can.

2258
02:34:01,738 --> 02:34:05,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you need a little inspiration, we have an inspiration for your FU story tonight.

2259
02:34:06,359 --> 02:34:09,340
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about a Virginia man named Bruce Jamar Walston.

2260
02:34:10,021 --> 02:34:17,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, authorities were called to his apartment by the girlfriend because apparently, a couple nights ago, the woman called 911.

2261
02:34:20,704 --> 02:34:21,904
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to like this, folks.

2262
02:34:22,184 --> 02:34:23,885
[SPEAKER_05]: You're really not going to like this, okay?

2263
02:34:25,245 --> 02:34:30,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And this really doesn't have anything to do with video games, but it does because I'm making the rounds on video game blogs, but just...

2264
02:34:31,854 --> 02:34:32,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to like it.

2265
02:34:33,215 --> 02:34:35,037
[SPEAKER_05]: You're really not going to like this.

2266
02:34:36,379 --> 02:34:47,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, the guy here that was arrested, Bruce Walston, was angered that the video game he was playing was disconnected by his girlfriend's new kitten.

2267
02:34:48,431 --> 02:34:49,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So he picked up the animal.

2268
02:34:51,034 --> 02:34:53,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to say what happened, but the animal died.

2269
02:34:56,334 --> 02:35:01,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And this all occurred, wait for it, wait for it, in front of the woman's children.

2270
02:35:04,543 --> 02:35:10,369
[SPEAKER_05]: He's being held without bond at the Middle River Regional Gerald in Verona in case you want to send him your cards and letters.

2271
02:35:11,410 --> 02:35:14,213
[SPEAKER_05]: For killing a kitten, for unplugging the video game console.

2272
02:35:14,574 --> 02:35:17,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only did he kill the cat, he did it in front of the children.

2273
02:35:19,712 --> 02:35:24,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Psychopath Mental Problems

2274
02:35:40,467 --> 02:35:41,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2275
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:00,480
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2276
02:36:24,690 --> 02:36:26,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would like to start... Good without Bond.

2277
02:36:26,372 --> 02:36:28,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to start off with the FUs of the week, DarkSakura?

2278
02:36:28,233 --> 02:36:29,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have some inspiration now?

2279
02:36:30,795 --> 02:36:31,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm disgusted.

2280
02:36:32,657 --> 02:36:33,258
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's disgusting.

2281
02:36:33,278 --> 02:36:34,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I said you wouldn't like it.

2282
02:36:37,021 --> 02:36:37,301
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2283
02:36:37,762 --> 02:36:39,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan said it's better he didn't kill the kid.

2284
02:36:39,363 --> 02:36:39,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than...

2285
02:36:43,533 --> 02:36:44,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan is yelling from the living room.

2286
02:36:44,614 --> 02:36:47,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie would be less mad if the guy had killed the kid.

2287
02:36:49,441 --> 02:36:49,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2288
02:36:50,082 --> 02:36:51,063
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still messed up.

2289
02:36:51,123 --> 02:36:52,465
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what, it's messed up.

2290
02:36:52,765 --> 02:36:53,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2291
02:36:53,646 --> 02:36:54,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make mine quick.

2292
02:36:55,068 --> 02:36:55,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2293
02:36:55,288 --> 02:36:59,654
[SPEAKER_03]: My first FU goes towards losing my voice and the little bit of cough I have left.

2294
02:37:00,615 --> 02:37:21,209
[SPEAKER_03]: My next one is a humongous FU to Helen Thomas who is one of the senior White House press corps members who basically went on record saying that Jews should get out of Palestine and go back to Germany or Poland.

2295
02:37:23,050 --> 02:37:23,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2296
02:37:24,411 --> 02:37:26,012
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't say go back to Jew land.

2297
02:37:27,953 --> 02:37:30,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's...

2298
02:37:31,653 --> 02:37:37,599
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, telling people to go back to places that, you know, they basically left due to, um, how about being murdered?

2299
02:37:38,821 --> 02:37:39,141
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?

2300
02:37:39,922 --> 02:37:44,146
[SPEAKER_03]: To go back to their homeland is just really insensitive.

2301
02:37:44,166 --> 02:37:47,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Helen Thomas should go back to her homeland, because I don't think she's Native American.

2302
02:37:47,910 --> 02:37:49,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, boat's coming.

2303
02:37:50,013 --> 02:37:50,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Get on it.

2304
02:37:50,793 --> 02:37:51,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2305
02:37:52,927 --> 02:38:00,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really, really... And you know, the only reason, she did apologize for it, but the only reason I think she apologized for it... She got caught.

2306
02:38:01,099 --> 02:38:02,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they called her on it.

2307
02:38:02,922 --> 02:38:07,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're calling for her resignation, or her to get sacked, and honestly...

2308
02:38:08,130 --> 02:38:08,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

2309
02:38:09,051 --> 02:38:19,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if she had her own personal private blog and said this as herself with a these views do not reflect White House blah blah blah fine.

2310
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:20,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Insensitive.

2311
02:38:21,141 --> 02:38:21,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Shitty as hell.

2312
02:38:22,402 --> 02:38:23,864
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still a bitch, but...

2313
02:38:24,524 --> 02:38:26,885
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is America.

2314
02:38:28,025 --> 02:38:30,826
[SPEAKER_05]: She has the right to be a bitch and we have the right to call her a bitch.

2315
02:38:30,886 --> 02:38:32,067
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what free speech is all about.

2316
02:38:32,087 --> 02:38:40,230
[SPEAKER_03]: But to say it in her capacity in a public forum as a representative of the White House press corps, as a senior representative.

2317
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:44,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Now tell me that's just not highly irresponsible and incredibly insensitive.

2318
02:38:45,311 --> 02:38:46,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she should get sacked.

2319
02:38:47,932 --> 02:38:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And drawn behind a cart by her toes.

2320
02:38:50,649 --> 02:38:52,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see Obama just punch her on the White House lawn.

2321
02:38:52,891 --> 02:38:53,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be amazing.

2322
02:38:53,792 --> 02:38:54,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go, bitch!

2323
02:38:56,835 --> 02:39:02,700
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, and that's just... Not that I'm advocating violence, but in special circumstances, it's okay.

2324
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:03,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what is funny?

2325
02:39:04,102 --> 02:39:07,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Because her apology is not even...

2326
02:39:07,845 --> 02:39:12,887
[SPEAKER_03]: She's saying that she deeply regretted the comments I made last week regarding Israelis and Palestinians.

2327
02:39:12,947 --> 02:39:19,850
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance.

2328
02:39:20,290 --> 02:39:21,311
[SPEAKER_03]: May that day come soon.

2329
02:39:21,711 --> 02:39:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: She didn't really address what she said.

2330
02:39:24,672 --> 02:39:25,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

2331
02:39:25,752 --> 02:39:30,514
[SPEAKER_03]: She just let out a blanket statement to appease everybody that doesn't really address the problem.

2332
02:39:31,835 --> 02:39:34,396
[SPEAKER_03]: If she was going to have any sincerity of it, she was going to say, you know what?

2333
02:39:35,076 --> 02:39:35,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wrong.

2334
02:39:36,357 --> 02:39:36,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

2335
02:39:39,457 --> 02:39:46,979
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to myself for having the obsessive compulsion to spend money on stupid things that I really don't need to spend money on like Project Under $100 for example

2336
02:40:02,526 --> 02:40:04,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that it's going to stop me from doing it.

2337
02:40:06,767 --> 02:40:09,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the fact that I don't have any airsoft guns.

2338
02:40:10,267 --> 02:40:14,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm also not in the airsoft community right now because I don't have any airsoft guns.

2339
02:40:14,468 --> 02:40:17,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I really want the Magpul PTS FPG.

2340
02:40:17,569 --> 02:40:19,549
[SPEAKER_06]: The folding pocket gun looks so awesome.

2341
02:40:20,149 --> 02:40:25,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a gun that folds out of a briefcase shape into a little personal assault rifle.

2342
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:26,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's awesome.

2343
02:40:26,650 --> 02:40:27,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

2344
02:40:27,310 --> 02:40:28,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also really expensive and I don't need it.

2345
02:40:29,471 --> 02:40:30,331
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I'm not buying it.

2346
02:40:32,252 --> 02:40:40,741
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to the returning side pains that I've been having because, yeah, that's why I went to the hospital a couple of years ago and I really don't want to go back.

2347
02:40:41,683 --> 02:40:44,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's Mother Nature trying to tell me I need to go on a diet again.

2348
02:40:44,406 --> 02:40:46,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I don't like being freaked out like that.

2349
02:40:47,189 --> 02:40:47,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks.

2350
02:40:48,570 --> 02:40:49,410
[SPEAKER_05]: A few to my body.

2351
02:40:50,450 --> 02:40:50,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Wah.

2352
02:40:51,791 --> 02:40:55,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on with just a couple more news stories for you guys.

2353
02:40:55,692 --> 02:40:56,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the Skype line.

2354
02:40:57,292 --> 02:40:58,432
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to the Skype line here.

2355
02:40:58,992 --> 02:41:05,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Admittedly, it's going to be a little bit shorter Skype line tonight because we had a really long show and we still have an afterbirth yet too before it gets too late.

2356
02:41:05,594 --> 02:41:08,214
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will at least take some calls here in just a little bit.

2357
02:41:08,255 --> 02:41:10,235
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, Loki, what you got for us?

2358
02:41:10,615 --> 02:41:17,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Games Convention Online in Leipzig is actually going to be going industry only this year.

2359
02:41:17,863 --> 02:41:23,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, I guess they had 43,000 attendees in 2009.

2360
02:41:24,509 --> 02:41:31,897
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they're just saying the number of registered public exhibitors was insufficient.

2361
02:41:33,178 --> 02:41:39,300
[SPEAKER_06]: and that satisfy the interests of the visitors whose past experiences bring them with high expectations to Leipzig.

2362
02:41:41,501 --> 02:41:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make sense why they're going to cut it, but they're planning on, I guess...

2363
02:41:47,637 --> 02:42:15,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Having 30 companies attending this year, which is already bigger than last year But it will not be open to the public So it's basically, this show's got too many common folk at it So in order for our show to get bigger For business to happen, it's basically what E3 did But, I mean, this is maybe a good example of why we don't have E3 open to the public Because it would be a nut house Alright

2364
02:42:16,930 --> 02:42:18,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with one more story

2365
02:42:34,202 --> 02:42:38,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, this is only announced stuff, because there's always surprises.

2366
02:42:38,986 --> 02:42:40,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Always, always, always surprises at E3.

2367
02:42:40,928 --> 02:42:45,051
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't take this as the definitive list of the only things being shown at E3.

2368
02:42:45,131 --> 02:42:47,153
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just what is confirmed thus far.

2369
02:42:47,993 --> 02:42:54,439
[SPEAKER_05]: 2K Games is showing Mafia 2, Sid Meier's Civilization V, Spec Ops The Line, and XCOM.

2370
02:42:54,699 --> 02:42:56,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know they were remaking XCOM.

2371
02:42:56,420 --> 02:43:00,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's supposed to be not so much like... It's more like a first-person shooter now.

2372
02:43:01,107 --> 02:43:06,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I might remember hearing it on a previous show or something, but this is the first time I remember hearing it right now.

2373
02:43:08,650 --> 02:43:09,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2374
02:43:09,230 --> 02:43:14,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision has Call of Duty Black Ops and Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock, and supposedly that's it.

2375
02:43:14,732 --> 02:43:15,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I somehow doubt that.

2376
02:43:16,533 --> 02:43:21,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Bethesda's bringing Brink, Fallout New Vegas, Hunted the Demon's Forge, and Rage.

[SPEAKER_05]: Capcom 2 has Dead Rising 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and an untitled sequel.

2378

[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2379
02:43:31,011 --> 02:43:32,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ignoring the mobile stuff.

2380
02:43:32,392 --> 02:43:36,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney Interactive Studios has Epic Mickey, Guilty Party, Pirates.

2381
02:43:37,055 --> 02:43:39,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they really going to call that game Epic Mickey?

2382
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:40,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a stupid title.

2383
02:43:40,857 --> 02:43:42,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be just the working title right now.

2384
02:43:42,418 --> 02:43:43,198
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope it is.

2385
02:43:43,258 --> 02:43:47,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go on record saying that is a stupid name for a video game.

2386
02:43:48,061 --> 02:43:53,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Pirates of the Caribbean, Armada of the Damned, Toy Story 3, Tron Evolution, and Tron Legacy.

2387
02:43:53,942 --> 02:43:55,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm all about checking out the Tron.

2388
02:43:55,462 --> 02:43:56,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are supposed to be cool.

2389
02:43:56,422 --> 02:43:58,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to see what that looks like.

2390
02:43:58,043 --> 02:43:58,723
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be awesome.

2396
02:45:01,533 --> 02:45:02,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Could DDR be dead?

2397
02:45:03,134 --> 02:45:03,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

2398
02:45:03,915 --> 02:45:05,396

[SPEAKER_05]: You think?

2402
02:45:12,930 --> 02:45:31,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling Alright, we'll see what happens Because, you know, Konami, they like doing gimmicky shit that doesn't make any sense for the franchise whatsoever For example, what they were showing off at last E3 with Dance Dance Revolution Playing Dance Dance Revolution on the Wii Fit balance board using your ass That made no fucking sense

2403
02:45:31,778 --> 02:45:34,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys want some video at E3 of me playing Def Jam Rapstar?

2404
02:45:37,304 --> 02:45:40,087
[SPEAKER_05]: You know who I want to see video playing that?

[SPEAKER_05]: I wish she could go to E3 this year.

02:45:45,052 --> 02:45:45,773

[SPEAKER_05]: Natsume is bringing Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar, and Lufia, Curse of the Sinistrals.

2413
02:46:34,716 --> 02:46:34,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

2414
02:46:35,236 --> 02:46:36,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I remember Lufia?

2415
02:46:36,197 --> 02:46:37,037
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming back.

2416
02:46:37,657 --> 02:46:39,417
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I think, a remake of the old games.

2417
02:46:39,437 --> 02:46:40,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have Lufia.

2418
02:46:40,598 --> 02:46:41,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming back.

2419
02:46:42,798 --> 02:46:42,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

2420
02:46:59,332 --> 02:47:00,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega's got Conduit 2.

2421
02:47:01,394 --> 02:47:02,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know they were making a Conduit 2.

2422
02:47:02,976 --> 02:47:03,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2423
02:47:03,417 --> 02:47:03,677

[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, The Last Guardian.

2428
02:47:36,868 --> 02:47:38,870
[SPEAKER_05]: That was that epic trailer last year, huh?

2429
02:47:39,010 --> 02:47:40,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was, yeah.

2430
02:47:40,091 --> 02:47:41,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I want to see that.

2431
02:47:42,293 --> 02:47:43,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds awesome.

2432
02:47:44,475 --> 02:47:45,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what else we got.

2434
02:47:55,223 --> 02:47:59,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that sounds kind of weird that that's at the Squeenix booth, but there's that whole merger now.

2435
02:47:59,826 --> 02:48:00,527
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it works.

02:48:32,918 --> 02:48:34,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Valve is bringing Portal 2.

2441
02:48:35,039 --> 02:48:39,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Warner Brothers is supposed to be showing Arkham Asylum 2 as well as Batman the Brave and the Bold.

[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Wii version.

[SPEAKER_05]: Cats and Dogs, The Revenge of Kitty Galore.

2444
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:47,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Notice how that's Kitty Galore and not the James Bond villain.

02:49:00,043 --> 02:49:00,463
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

2448
02:49:00,543 --> 02:49:01,863
[SPEAKER_05]: A list of what is being shown to E3.

2449
02:49:02,163 --> 02:49:03,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like it's going to be a fun year, isn't it?

2450
02:49:05,824 --> 02:49:07,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I... I think it's with adjectives now.

2451
02:49:07,344 --> 02:49:07,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited.

2452
02:49:07,864 --> 02:49:08,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, that's what I meant.

2453
02:49:08,804 --> 02:49:09,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Adjectives, not verbs.

2454
02:49:09,865 --> 02:49:11,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you have all of it, though, it seems like?

2455
02:49:12,145 --> 02:49:12,325
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2456
02:49:13,790 --> 02:49:15,171
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be hard to spawn a verb.

2457
02:49:15,611 --> 02:49:16,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Spawn run.

2458
02:49:20,913 --> 02:49:21,253
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2459
02:49:22,033 --> 02:49:26,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is the part of the show where we're going to get to some last minute stories because, well, actually, I take that back.

2460
02:49:26,875 --> 02:49:28,115
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have calls coming in.

2461
02:49:28,576 --> 02:49:29,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the Skype line.

2462
02:49:29,776 --> 02:49:34,078
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2463
02:49:34,118 --> 02:49:35,518
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go to the Skype line right now.

2464
02:49:35,538 --> 02:49:36,619
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already got calls coming in.

2465
02:49:36,679 --> 02:49:36,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

2466
02:49:37,219 --> 02:49:37,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2467
02:49:37,959 --> 02:49:38,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2468
02:49:39,780 --> 02:49:40,800
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ray Iannami.

2469
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:42,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Ray Iannami.

2470
02:49:42,101 --> 02:49:42,781
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2471
02:49:44,570 --> 02:49:46,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been back from Fanime for about a week now.

2472
02:49:47,371 --> 02:49:49,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Fanime was over Memorial Day weekend.

2473
02:49:50,011 --> 02:49:51,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, I was not there.

2474
02:49:51,352 --> 02:49:52,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Portland.

2475
02:49:52,332 --> 02:49:53,492
[SPEAKER_05]: But how was Fanime this year?

2476
02:49:55,693 --> 02:49:56,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty fun.

2477
02:49:57,213 --> 02:49:58,513
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to get better every year.

2478
02:50:00,374 --> 02:50:04,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a few crappy parts, but it doesn't detract from the experience as a whole, usually.

2479
02:50:06,135 --> 02:50:10,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first things first, I've got to ask, since it is a video game show, how is the game room at Fanime?

2480
02:50:12,222 --> 02:50:13,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I can't think back.

2481
02:50:13,803 --> 02:50:23,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Gaming Room for Arcades, they had like the usual stuff from last year, but this time they have a few new things like Mushihime-sama and DJ Max Technica.

2482
02:50:23,929 --> 02:50:30,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I was especially excited to see Technica, even if they didn't have the Platinum Crew servers, but I expected it not to be there anyway.

2483
02:50:31,553 --> 02:50:33,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they wheel that all over from SVGL or something?

2484
02:50:34,855 --> 02:50:35,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, actually, no.

2485
02:50:36,015 --> 02:50:38,297
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I've heard, like some years ago...

2486
02:50:39,235 --> 02:50:49,718
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some fallout between Fanami and Goffland, so now Fanami gets their machines from university arcades, like someone from San Jose State and UCLA.

2487
02:50:50,478 --> 02:50:50,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

2488
02:50:51,619 --> 02:50:52,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

2489
02:50:52,539 --> 02:50:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we ended up getting UCLA's machine.

2490
02:50:55,940 --> 02:50:56,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, interesting.

2491
02:50:57,221 --> 02:50:57,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's cool.

2492
02:50:57,961 --> 02:50:59,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like Gamer was fun.

2493
02:51:00,222 --> 02:51:04,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Consulate Gaming was a bit of a letdown this year, mainly because there weren't as many TVs, like

2494
02:51:06,078 --> 02:51:13,222
[SPEAKER_08]: The concentration of people playing fighting games to people playing other games like Classy Games and Shmucks and such was really high this year.

2495
02:51:14,383 --> 02:51:26,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you pick a random TV, four to five times it's probably going to be Brawl or something else, or Rock Band or something.

2496
02:51:26,330 --> 02:51:28,751
[SPEAKER_08]: I say it pretty much every damn con gaming room.

2497
02:51:31,147 --> 02:51:32,387
[SPEAKER_05]: What about some cosplay?

2498
02:51:32,447 --> 02:51:34,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there any good gaming cosplay?

2499
02:51:34,128 --> 02:51:35,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I know DarkSakura was showing me a picture earlier.

2500
02:51:35,989 --> 02:51:38,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was from Fanime, but some Metal Gear cosplay.

2501
02:51:38,610 --> 02:51:40,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there any good gaming cosplay you saw?

2502
02:51:40,090 --> 02:51:43,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

2503
02:51:44,732 --> 02:51:45,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like what?

2504
02:51:45,992 --> 02:51:49,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a picture of a Vanille from Final Fantasy XIII that looked really cute.

2505
02:51:50,354 --> 02:51:51,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought she did a good job.

2506
02:51:51,514 --> 02:51:52,335
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you see?

2507
02:51:52,695 --> 02:51:59,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a lot of Toho cosplay, though that's mainly because I went to the Toho gathering and the explosion of Toho-related events on Sunday.

2508
02:52:00,552 --> 02:52:12,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at some of your pictures, it looks like there was a Pac-Man there I'm looking at, and I'm looking at a Black Mage and a Sackboy Loki's Sackboy costume is better though

2509
02:52:27,762 --> 02:52:30,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw some BlazBlue cosplay, like Hazama and Lychee.

2510
02:52:30,784 --> 02:52:31,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cool.

2511
02:52:32,385 --> 02:52:37,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a couple Captain Falcons, which is one of the alternate palettes from Super Smash Bros., interestingly.

2512
02:52:39,048 --> 02:52:44,111
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also the guy who does British cosplay every year, so glad to see him every year.

2513
02:52:45,812 --> 02:52:48,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what's this about where there were some protesters?

2514
02:52:48,754 --> 02:52:50,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Were people protesting Faname?

2515
02:52:50,495 --> 02:52:51,155
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with this?

2516
02:52:52,076 --> 02:52:53,897
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't protesting Faname, per se.

2517
02:52:54,037 --> 02:52:54,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a...

2518
02:52:55,012 --> 02:53:03,016
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically, you know about those Fire and Brimstone preachers that go turn or burn and such like that?

2519
02:53:03,416 --> 02:53:04,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

2520
02:53:04,256 --> 02:53:04,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You always see them out.

2521
02:53:05,017 --> 02:53:08,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, even when I was in Portland, there was one out at the fair.

2522
02:53:08,238 --> 02:53:14,942
[SPEAKER_05]: They do, like, a cute little fair downtown where a lot of local vendors come out and sell their, you know, local goods.

2523
02:53:14,982 --> 02:53:22,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was some guy standing there on the street corner, you know, spouting their whole thing about, you know, everybody's going to hell and that whole thing.

2524
02:53:22,985 --> 02:53:24,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Faname got a little bit of that?

2525
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:50,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I came across a Guitar Freaks V4 machine with EMU slots, but it's not connected to EMUs No, I don't really play Guitar Freaks or Drum Mania, I'm more of a 2DX person and VGMAX person

2526
02:53:53,232 --> 02:53:54,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they did.

2527
02:53:55,194 --> 02:54:00,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And interestingly, it was a hacked version of 2DX Empress with DJ Maxx Crossovers and other things on it.

2528
02:54:00,498 --> 02:54:05,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play it because the screen was laggy, and laggy screens make me rage quit.

2529
02:54:05,781 --> 02:54:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, wait, wait.

2530
02:54:07,303 --> 02:54:11,265
[SPEAKER_05]: There was DJ Maxx Crossovers in this game?

2531
02:54:11,986 --> 02:54:12,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a hack?

2532
02:54:13,667 --> 02:54:18,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, someone hacked some DJ Maxx songs into 2DX, which was very interesting.

2533
02:54:19,371 --> 02:54:21,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a video of it on YouTube before.

2534
02:54:24,301 --> 02:54:25,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, interesting.

2535
02:54:26,101 --> 02:54:29,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't even know something like that existed, but that's cool.

2536
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:32,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, any other thoughts on Fandomay you want to tell us before we let you go?

2537
02:54:34,544 --> 02:54:35,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2538
02:54:36,224 --> 02:54:42,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what Fandomay could do next year for their console gaming is maybe have one section where there's no fighting games or anything like that.

2539
02:54:43,266 --> 02:54:50,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, classic games and shooters and other things that don't require you to kick ass and have fun.

2540
02:54:50,548 --> 02:54:50,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

2541
02:54:51,872 --> 02:54:54,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about a classic game room like they have at PAX.

2542
02:54:54,634 --> 02:54:55,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff.

2543
02:55:07,068 --> 02:55:10,790
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen you guys since 2007, so I'm getting worried if I'll ever see you at Fanime again.

2544
02:55:10,810 --> 02:55:11,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Fanime next year.

2545
02:55:11,470 --> 02:55:13,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's in July, aka next month.

2546
02:55:27,128 --> 02:55:31,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll go to that, because I've never been to California Extreme, and I'd really like to go.

2547
02:55:31,731 --> 02:55:32,631
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, DarkSakura?

2548
02:55:32,671 --> 02:55:32,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it.

2549
02:55:32,812 --> 02:55:34,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think we'll make it to July?

2550
02:55:35,013 --> 02:55:35,693
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what we can do.

2551
02:55:36,073 --> 02:55:40,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to make any promises yet, but July would be a lot better than June, so maybe.

2552
02:55:42,057 --> 02:55:46,780
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Ray, we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thank you so much for your call, and have fun.

2553
02:55:47,617 --> 02:55:48,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, see ya Later

2554
02:56:06,031 --> 02:56:07,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey Spazinator, what's on your mind?

2555
02:56:07,913 --> 02:56:08,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I had, um...

2556
02:56:30,947 --> 02:56:38,550
[SPEAKER_09]: One question that kind of ties in very loosely to the last call that you had.

2557
02:56:40,291 --> 02:56:45,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I was kind of wondering, is there any retro games that you would love to see either in...

2558
02:56:47,057 --> 02:56:53,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft Game Room or on PSN that's not already there or hasn't been announced?

2559
02:57:04,759 --> 02:57:07,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see stuff like Impossible Mission and so forth released over here.

2560
02:57:21,733 --> 02:57:32,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that my earlier inkling that if Game Room is going to reach thousands of games, then they're going to dip into the old Apple IIe library and the Commodore 64 library and some of that.

2561
02:57:32,498 --> 02:57:37,100
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope my inkling there is correct because there's lots of Commodore 64 games I would love to see get the treatment.

2562
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:41,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you guys should see some of the EA games back when they were ECA.

2563
02:57:41,082 --> 02:57:42,363
[SPEAKER_05]: They made some pretty epic games.

2564
02:57:43,083 --> 02:57:45,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Mule, M-U-L-E, was a great game on the 64.

2565
02:57:46,204 --> 02:57:47,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to see make a comeback.

2566
02:57:48,765 --> 02:57:53,306
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a lot of those classic computer games of yesteryear I would love to see.

2567
02:57:53,926 --> 02:57:55,847
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that happens on PSN, that would be great too.

2568
02:57:56,207 --> 02:58:01,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I sort of see the classic stuff on PSN as being more of a Sony-based thing usually.

2569
02:58:01,868 --> 02:58:03,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't usually see a lot of old stuff.

2570
02:58:03,768 --> 02:58:04,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what's interesting?

2571
02:58:04,529 --> 02:58:06,089
[SPEAKER_05]: There has been some obscure stuff.

2572
02:58:06,109 --> 02:58:07,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give you one retro title.

2573
02:58:07,829 --> 02:58:10,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Digger HD is out on PlayStation Network.

2574
02:58:10,790 --> 02:58:12,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of an overlooked title.

2575
02:58:12,550 --> 02:58:15,171
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a remake of an old, old PC game.

2576
02:58:15,211 --> 02:58:16,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's really cool...

2577
02:58:16,531 --> 02:58:19,312
[SPEAKER_05]: The old PC game is in there and playable.

2578
02:58:19,932 --> 02:58:30,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not one of my favorite classic games and not one that necessarily necessitated the treatment it got, but I think it's an example of a retro remake done really well.

2579
02:58:31,335 --> 02:58:33,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is on PlayStation Network and not on 360.

2580
02:58:33,776 --> 02:58:35,956
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only on PSN, Digger HD.

2581
02:58:36,016 --> 02:58:37,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worth a look.

2582
02:58:37,897 --> 02:58:38,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

2583
02:58:38,797 --> 02:58:39,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I got that one, too.

2584
02:58:40,458 --> 02:58:44,559
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I got that, too, I went to see roughly about a month and a half ago.

2585
02:58:44,599 --> 02:58:45,219
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty good.

2586
02:58:46,433 --> 02:59:01,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, at least in terms of game room, what I would love to see is virtually any old classic Capcom game.

2587
02:59:03,024 --> 02:59:11,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom, before they really started going gung-ho on home consoles, they've been known for their arcade titles, whether it be the 1940 series, the

2588
02:59:14,261 --> 02:59:21,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Street Fighter series, Ghosts and Goblins, and so on and so forth.

2589
02:59:21,129 --> 02:59:32,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Room badly needs other publishers on board because right now the only Game Room games that are coming out are Atari, Activision, Intellivision,

2590
02:59:32,703 --> 02:59:33,343
[SPEAKER_05]: and Konami.

2591
02:59:33,803 --> 02:59:34,344
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2592
02:59:34,704 --> 02:59:38,045
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not seeing games from at least I can think of off the top of my head.

2593
02:59:38,325 --> 02:59:40,986
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe there are any other publishers games showing up in Game Room.

2594
02:59:41,366 --> 02:59:45,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is odd because they promised this thousand games thing earlier.

2595
02:59:45,888 --> 02:59:48,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's also strange to me, this week in Game Room

2596
02:59:49,757 --> 02:59:52,819
[SPEAKER_05]: GamePacks 3 and 4 were packs of 14 games split into 2 weeks worth of releases.

2597
02:59:52,839 --> 02:59:58,983
[SPEAKER_05]: GamePack 5 just came out and we got 5 games this week, which makes me think it's going to be 3 weeks worth now.

2598
03:00:13,792 --> 03:00:17,214
[SPEAKER_05]: They're stretching these game packs out longer and longer.

2599
03:00:17,294 --> 03:00:19,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they are going to run out of games.

2600
03:00:21,156 --> 03:00:26,358
[SPEAKER_05]: My hope is that they are going to make some big announcements at E3, and that's kind of why we're waiting.

2601
03:00:26,738 --> 03:00:32,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now, okay, well, the three weeks for Game Pack 5 would take us right through the end of E3.

2602
03:00:32,361 --> 03:00:34,222
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also a delay this week.

2603
03:00:34,722 --> 03:00:36,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Pack 5 was held up by a day.

2604
03:00:36,863 --> 03:00:39,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if maybe this all plays into it, but I really hope...

2605
03:00:40,405 --> 03:00:45,326
[SPEAKER_05]: that they are coming out at E3 and saying, hey, we have these other publishers on board for Game Room.

2606
03:00:45,927 --> 03:00:48,827
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't do that, Game Room is doomed.

2607
03:00:49,388 --> 03:00:53,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really a bummer because there's so much potential with Game Room.

2608
03:00:53,789 --> 03:00:57,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I fired up Video Pinball this week, which was one of the releases.

2609
03:00:58,050 --> 03:01:01,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not what I remember when I was six.

2610
03:01:01,651 --> 03:01:03,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of disappointed.

2611
03:01:04,932 --> 03:01:08,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, in fact, I had just recently bought...

2612
03:01:10,037 --> 03:01:30,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Super Breakouts, and, you know, as Bobby Blackwell pointed out on his show, you know, without the panel, it is kind of a pain in the arse to play Daggy, but still, even with that being said, you know, there's the whole nostalgia factor, you know, considering that, you

2613
03:01:32,565 --> 03:01:37,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the first game I ever played was Syphon Blackjack on the 2600, so there's something behind that.

2614
03:01:49,355 --> 03:01:49,615
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2615
03:02:16,496 --> 03:02:40,849
[SPEAKER_05]: and I've gone on this tangent in previous shows I'm really worried that Game Room is going to be a giant disappointment and it's almost more disappointing because if it doesn't work you're not going to see anyone else want to try it and there was such good ideas here but I really think those Chrome layoffs affected things harder than they claimed it was going to but I hope they're at E3 because I'm going to ask some questions I can't wait

2616
03:02:42,645 --> 03:03:03,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I really hope that, you know, despite the layoffs, they do manage to really turn out the games for it and they get all the support from the gaming community that they deserve, you know, because I just hate to have to wait another generation or two for something similar to Game Room, you know?

2617
03:03:04,229 --> 03:03:05,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope, let's hope.

2618
03:03:05,589 --> 03:03:10,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Spazinator, I've got to let you go because we're going to go and wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for your call, okay?

2619
03:03:11,585 --> 03:03:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, sure.

2620
03:03:12,205 --> 03:03:12,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2621
03:03:12,806 --> 03:03:13,306
[SPEAKER_05]: You too, buddy.

2622
03:03:14,367 --> 03:03:14,667
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2623
03:03:15,387 --> 03:03:16,688
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2624
03:03:16,748 --> 03:03:23,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to close the phones, but we're kind of running long tonight because part A was really, really long tonight.

2625
03:03:23,091 --> 03:03:24,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost two hours long.

2626
03:03:24,232 --> 03:03:29,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately, I am going to close up the Skype line so we can kind of wrap up the show because we still have an after work to get to and all that fun stuff.

2627
03:03:29,815 --> 03:03:30,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And last minute stories.

2628
03:03:30,696 --> 03:03:34,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't let Loki finish last minute stories, but I did want to invite callers.

2629
03:03:34,198 --> 03:03:35,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Please email us right now.

2630
03:03:35,578 --> 03:03:37,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at orange lounge reader dot com.

2631
03:03:37,319 --> 03:03:39,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your thoughts out so we can read them on next week's show.

2632
03:03:39,701 --> 03:03:39,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

2633
03:03:40,541 --> 03:03:42,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, other things.

2634
03:03:42,785 --> 03:03:45,651
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a game that I think we talked about a long time ago.

2635
03:03:46,172 --> 03:03:50,259
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a Grand Theft Auto kind of demake, I guess.

2636
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:51,621
[SPEAKER_06]: They were doing...

2637
03:03:53,703 --> 03:03:54,764
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2638
03:04:15,943 --> 03:04:17,445
[SPEAKER_06]: and it looks pretty awesome.

2639
03:04:17,465 --> 03:04:32,061
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have a bunch of different parodies on different things like Metal Gear, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and whatnot, Sonic and the game itself is pretty much an open world action game just like the old school top down Grand Theft Autos.

2640
03:04:32,942 --> 03:04:33,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

2641
03:04:33,343 --> 03:04:34,464
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty sweet.

2642
03:04:34,804 --> 03:04:35,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2643
03:04:35,785 --> 03:04:35,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2644
03:04:40,774 --> 03:04:48,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently some of the Nintendo portables, the DSi XL, they are getting some new colors of the DSi XL.

2645
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:52,862
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be yellow, blue, and green coming out in Japan.

2646
03:04:53,642 --> 03:04:58,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And also in time for all that stuff, they're going to be dropping the price as well.

2647
03:04:59,686 --> 03:05:02,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So cutting it down from 20,000 yen to 18,000 yen.

2648
03:05:02,847 --> 03:05:06,149
[SPEAKER_06]: And the DSI will also drop down from 18,900 yen to about 15,000 yen.

2649
03:05:14,391 --> 03:05:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of interesting.

2650
03:05:15,592 --> 03:05:18,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's kind of getting ready for the 3DS.

2651
03:05:18,795 --> 03:05:20,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that blue one's kind of pretty, though.

2652
03:05:20,796 --> 03:05:21,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So is the green one.

2653
03:05:21,657 --> 03:05:22,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Yellow one I could do without.

2654
03:05:22,918 --> 03:05:23,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2655
03:05:24,159 --> 03:05:29,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also in the UK, the DSi is getting the price drop as well.

2656
03:05:29,544 --> 03:05:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Could they be announcing one on stage next week?

2657
03:05:31,806 --> 03:05:32,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2658
03:05:32,467 --> 03:05:34,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Could that possibly be happening?

2659
03:05:35,149 --> 03:05:38,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the funny thing is these are all starting on June 18th.

2660
03:05:41,222 --> 03:05:41,643
[SPEAKER_06]: June 18th.

2661
03:05:41,723 --> 03:05:47,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that does coincide with something, I'm sure, if I put my mind to it.

2662
03:05:48,465 --> 03:05:58,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, they will be dropping the price as well from 150 euros to looks like 120 to 130 euros around there.

2663
03:06:00,050 --> 03:06:00,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2664
03:06:04,412 --> 03:06:07,673
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a rumor that Kim Kardashian is going to be the next Lara Croft.

2665
03:06:08,574 --> 03:06:09,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

2666
03:06:11,670 --> 03:06:14,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Got the assets to be Lara Croft, but that's about it.

2667
03:06:14,051 --> 03:06:15,651
[SPEAKER_06]: She can't act her way out of a box.

2668
03:06:16,651 --> 03:06:16,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

2669
03:06:17,171 --> 03:06:17,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really care.

2670
03:06:18,972 --> 03:06:28,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Motorstorm 3 apparently is going post-apocalyptic, and this is coming from some screens leaked on the French website PS3Gen.

2671
03:06:30,035 --> 03:06:41,318
[SPEAKER_06]: They have what they claim to be some stolen images of Motorstorm 3 showing kind of a, I guess, San Francisco map that has buildings crumbling and whatnot.

2672
03:06:42,823 --> 03:06:47,420
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, if this is actually real, this is kind of what Fuel should have been, but

2673
03:06:49,204 --> 03:06:49,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like that.

2674
03:06:49,864 --> 03:06:50,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that'd be kind of cool.

2675
03:06:50,925 --> 03:06:54,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really get into the last Motorstorm game, but the first one was pretty good.

2676
03:06:54,767 --> 03:06:55,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be interesting.

2677
03:06:56,388 --> 03:06:57,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested.

2678
03:06:58,089 --> 03:07:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, Def Jam Rapstar is going to be coming out I guess this year.

2679
03:07:03,992 --> 03:07:07,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe, October 5th and North America, November 6th.

2680
03:07:08,174 --> 03:07:11,376
[SPEAKER_06]: The game will retail for $69.99 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and $59.99 on the Wii.

2681
03:07:11,396 --> 03:07:12,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming it comes with one microphone.

2682
03:07:17,679 --> 03:07:20,542
[SPEAKER_06]: and some of the songs that have been announced for it.

2683
03:07:21,202 --> 03:07:38,535
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got Biz Marquis' Just a Friend, Drake's Best I Ever Had, Ice Cube's With It Was a Good Day, Outkast's So Fresh, So Clean by Pete Rock and CL Smooth's The Reminisce Is Over You, Troy.

2684
03:07:41,242 --> 03:07:49,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, also Redman's and Method Man's Da Rock Wilder and Salt Peppers Push It.

2685
03:07:49,427 --> 03:07:50,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Push it real good.

2686
03:07:50,448 --> 03:08:02,034
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have a freestyle mode as well as a couple of original instrumental tracks, which I guess will tie in with the freestyle mode.

2687
03:08:04,275 --> 03:08:04,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

2688
03:08:05,717 --> 03:08:21,274
[SPEAKER_05]: comments from our chat room chat.org.com salaciouspop commenting on the Kim Kardashian role you can't do backflips with an ass that fat I'm Too Good says if the second Lara Croft movie was the first one it wouldn't have bombed it was much better than the first hmm

2689
03:08:24,033 --> 03:08:25,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I never saw either one, I gotta admit.

2690
03:08:25,935 --> 03:08:27,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't watch a lot of video game movies.

2691
03:08:27,295 --> 03:08:28,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see Resident Evil.

2692
03:08:28,436 --> 03:08:30,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill was obviously the last one I saw.

2693
03:08:30,457 --> 03:08:31,058
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good one.

2694
03:08:31,078 --> 03:08:32,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go back and watch that again.

2695
03:08:32,899 --> 03:08:34,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was underrated by most people, but whatevs.

2696
03:08:36,001 --> 03:08:38,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Different movies for different people, I suppose.

2697
03:08:38,797 --> 03:08:39,077
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2698
03:08:53,997 --> 03:08:55,798
[SPEAKER_05]: We might just have to give them what they want.

2699
03:08:56,218 --> 03:08:59,060
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice after all, so we'll be doing that.

2700
03:08:59,380 --> 03:09:01,901
[SPEAKER_05]: We might be actually doing a press conference live.

2701
03:09:02,061 --> 03:09:06,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have to steal the audio from another site, so we'll have to figure that out.

2702
03:09:06,123 --> 03:09:10,065
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody knows of a site that's doing the audio live Sunday, please... Which one is it?

03:09:13,967 --> 03:09:14,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe it will be.

03:09:39,794 --> 03:09:43,799

2711
03:09:44,159 --> 03:09:49,726
[SPEAKER_05]: We are by the people, for the people, and we really only get our advertising done via word of mouth.

03:09:50,086 --> 03:10:15,641
