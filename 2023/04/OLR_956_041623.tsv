0	13760	It's been over a decade since yours truly was on Orange Lounge Radio, reporting on Nintendo's
13760	18160	Wii U pre-release tour, and since then Nintendo Directs have become hugely relevant to fans.
18160	20920	Nintendo has always had a great presence in Japan, but now they are getting back into
20920	23240	the convention by and about them game stateside.
23240	24240	What's next?
24240	27000	A theme park section devoted to their popular franchises?
27000	29240	Oh, right, that happened already.
29360	30360	It's a me.
30360	33320	And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about
33320	36240	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every
36240	37240	gamer has a voice.
39440	44480	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
44480	46480	where every gamer has a voice.
46480	53440	It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live and ready to go once again with episode
53440	59560	number 956 of our show for tonight, April the 16th of 2023.
59560	64640	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week as we tape our show live, broadcast
64640	68640	it out to the world, and put it all up in a podcast for people to consume throughout
68640	72480	the week to talk about the latest and greatest in video games and gaming culture and all
72480	73880	that good stuff.
73880	76560	Like I said, I'm Rob, and with me are my co-hosts.
76560	79640	Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.
79640	80640	Hello.
80640	82640	I'm getting ready.
82840	83840	Getting ready?
83840	89440	Well, I was going to say, so now we've transitioned from your birthday month to your birthday
89440	90440	week.
90440	92440	So happy birthday week.
92440	95440	It's holy week now.
95440	102440	And how do we celebrate the golden week of Dark Sakura's birthday?
102440	105440	Should I bake a cake with strawberries?
105440	112440	Actually, I'm meeting a fellow streamer on Tuesday, Silly Candy, who lives in our area.
113440	116440	And we're going to go to Danielle's for crepes.
116440	117440	Oh, yum.
117440	118440	I love that place.
118440	119440	I love crepes.
119440	125440	I haven't been in an age, but it's going to be fun.
125440	128440	And then, of course, my subathon thing is more like a suggestion.
128440	133440	It's just like, come hang out with me while you get to see me in increasing levels of
133440	134440	sleep deprivation.
134440	139440	And I'm going to play more than Dead by Daylight, probably, maybe.
139440	141440	I'll definitely be there.
141440	145440	I won't be able to be there till after work because I have a very, very busy work week,
145440	146440	but I'll be there eventually.
146440	147440	That's fine.
147440	148440	Oh, geez.
148440	149440	Just make it worth the wait.
149440	150440	Uh-oh, we have a spill.
150440	151440	Clean up on Isle Jamie.
151440	152440	All right.
152440	155440	Yeah, and all my new shirts, too.
155440	160440	While you work on that, I'm going to go over to Tech Master Loki.
160440	161440	Hey, Loki.
161440	162440	How are you doing?
162440	163440	I'm doing pretty good.
163440	164440	Yeah?
164440	165440	How's your week going?
165440	166440	I'm tired.
166440	167440	Yeah?
168440	172440	I'm hungover, so that makes two of us.
172440	179440	I saw you were going full Karen on the Minecraft Twitter this week asking for the results of
179440	180440	the contest.
180440	182440	It's been a month.
182440	183440	It has been a month.
183440	185440	You still haven't heard anything, huh?
185440	186440	Nope.
186440	187440	All right.
187440	188440	Maybe, I guess.
188440	194440	They closed down the channel on Discord, too, for that particular, well, just for that particular
194440	196440	content, because it's so over now.
196440	204440	It's just like, okay, somebody forgot, because they've run like two or three more contests
204440	207440	since then, and they've had results.
207440	208440	Oh, no.
208440	209440	Anybody?
209440	213440	The intern who is in charge of that competition unfortunately got sacked.
213440	215440	I actually hope that's not true.
215440	219440	I would actually feel bad if that was legit the case, but unfortunately, that's the world
219440	220440	we live in.
220440	224440	Well, hopefully, it ends up being one of those good things come to those who wait sort of
224440	225440	situation.
226440	227440	All right.
227440	230440	Of course, we do tape our show live, as I was mentioning earlier, every Sunday night
230440	234440	at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash
234440	235440	VOG Network.
235440	240440	That's V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
240440	244440	You can watch us as we answer your comments in our chat if you want to chat along with
244440	249440	our show live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
249440	254440	Interesting, as the show owner Matt says, maybe it's Capcom holding things up.
254440	255440	Hmm.
255440	256440	Maybe.
256440	257440	Maybe it's Maybelline.
257440	258440	Maybe it is.
258440	263440	Pod Culture says, I won an Injustice 3, so our little intro joke tonight for the Twitch
263440	268440	had to do with Injustice turning 10 years old, because that was a PS3 game.
268440	272440	Technically, Injustice qualifies as Classic Game of the Week at this point, which is wild
272440	275440	to think about, and it's one of those things where it's like, oh, where did time go?
275440	276440	That is really-
276440	279440	It also has a really terrible looking arcade game.
279440	281440	I just don't understand-
281440	283440	Isn't it a ticket spitter?
283440	287440	Maybe, but there's no joystick on it.
287440	290440	It's just attack buttons.
290440	291440	I saw that.
291440	295440	I happened to randomly be at round one in Roseville yesterday, so maybe getting into
295440	297440	my gaming week a little bit, but we decided to do so.
297440	299440	My friends and I, they all play Pikmin.
299440	304440	We wanted to get our 10,000 steps in, but it was a little warm yesterday, and I haven't
304440	310440	had to worry about this for the last 17 years, because our local sports ball team is actually
310440	315440	in the playoffs for the first time almost ever, walking down-
315440	316440	That's the name of hell that happened.
316440	317440	Yeah, I know, right?
317440	318440	What the hell?
318440	322440	Apparently, not to get too into sports, because y'all won't know what show you're listening
322440	328440	to if I do that, but apparently, the new coach they got is so good, he's like the coach of
328440	330440	the year for the whole NBA.
330440	332440	Let's see if he can turn our team around.
332440	334440	Yeah, I know, right?
335440	340440	It was always like when I was in band, if we did a bad marching show, our football team
340440	341440	would win.
341440	343440	That's what I'm feeling like.
343440	346440	Anyway, the point was we couldn't go walking downtown.
346440	349440	We didn't want to go walking downtown, because it's going to be a little bit of a shit show
349440	350440	with all that going on.
350440	355440	Once they light the beam, it goes nuts, so we didn't want to walk down there.
355440	357440	We were actually in midtown yesterday for dinner.
357440	358440	Oh, no.
358440	362440	Well, no, it was fine, because we were way on the other side, but originally, our plans
362440	368440	were like, oh, yeah, after dinner, we're going to go to downtown to go to this underground
368440	372440	mini golf place, and I'm like...
372440	374440	Oh, the putt-putt golf thing there?
374440	376440	Yeah, there's like a...
376440	377440	That place is cute.
377440	380440	I went to a drag bingo there during the week once.
380440	382440	It's that putt-putt golf or whatever is cute.
382440	383440	Yeah.
383440	384440	Oh, shit.
384440	385440	It's right next to the arena.
385440	386440	Yeah.
386440	387440	We were going to go there.
387440	389440	I was like, I don't want to go there during playoff.
389440	390440	No, you don't.
390440	391440	No, you don't.
391440	397440	That was a wise decision, because from what I understand, there were lots of people watching
397440	401440	the game outside, because if you've walked by the arena, they have giant LED screens
401440	405440	there, so if you weren't in the arena watching the game, you could watch outside, and it
405440	406440	was packed.
406440	410440	Then, of course, oh, my God, I really am talking about sports on Orange Launch Radio.
410440	411440	What the...
411440	412440	It must be April.
412440	414440	What the fuck is going on here in this day?
414440	420140	Anyway, because all those people were there, so I made a little joke about light the beam,
420140	422140	which has become this big thing in Sacramento.
422140	427140	Whenever the Kings win a game, they literally have a purple space laser that they fire into
427140	431140	the air, and they shine it until midnight, and you can see it from all over town.
431140	435140	Now, thanks to this, everybody screams, light the beam.
435140	440140	I picture a very, what was her name in Austin Powers?
440140	441140	Frow.
441140	442140	Frow.
442140	443140	Yes.
443140	444140	Yeah.
444140	445140	Light the beam.
445140	446140	It's her whenever they win.
447140	449140	And here's my thing.
449140	455140	Why stand outside when you could be at home in your pajamas watching it?
455140	457140	Why do people tailgate?
457140	458140	It's the same thing.
458140	466140	Because Kings players, or excuse me, Kings fans are insane, and I have tons of friends
466140	467140	who are Kings fans.
467140	473140	I say that with tongue firmly planted in cheek, but when it's the only professional sports
473140	478140	thing at all your town of a million people has, people get really into it.
478140	480140	It was funny.
480140	483140	I didn't know what light the beam was for the longest time.
483140	486140	It's like I've seen bumper stickers on cars that said light the beam.
486140	488140	I'm like, is this a cult or something?
488140	489140	What is this?
489140	491140	They have minor league baseball.
491140	493140	As it turns out, Loki, yes, it is a cult.
493140	494140	It's more fun.
494140	495140	Yeah, no.
495140	500140	Well, it goes to show, yeah, I see people in chat talking about soccer, and yeah, people
500140	502140	get really into minor league soccer.
502140	506140	I would say the River Cats probably have more of a fan following than most minor league
506140	507140	teams out there.
507140	510140	I would be willing to wage money on that.
510140	514140	Then our local soccer, the Free Republic, what is it?
514140	519140	FC Republic, Sac FC Republic that plays at Cal Expo, those games are always well attended
519140	520140	too.
520140	523140	They've been trying to push soccer here for a long time.
523140	529140	I think the pandemic threw a lot of that for a loop, but they definitely want soccer here
529140	530140	full-time.
530140	531140	This town is full of soccer moms.
531140	532140	Real football.
532140	533140	Yeah, actual football.
533140	534140	Real football.
534140	542140	All right, anyway, I promise that's all the sports tonight.
542140	548140	Whatever few listeners we had left finally turned it off like, wow, OLRs talking about
548140	549140	sports.
549140	550140	I don't know what the fuck happened.
550140	554140	If you're watching live, you can just pay attention to the video that's behind my head.
554140	556140	I don't even know you anymore.
556140	557140	What the hell is that?
558140	562140	Is this some skateboard game that's got bugs galore?
562140	563140	It looks like.
563140	564140	What is that, Logie?
564140	567140	It's Skate 3, but it's Helix Snake.
567140	572140	Helix Snake used to exploit a bunch of different glitches in that game and has the most hilarious
572140	573140	videos.
573140	577140	I've watched his videos for 10 years now, and I can still go back to them, and they're
577140	579140	just as hilarious as the first time.
579140	581140	I'm going to try not to crack myself.
581140	584140	I'm just going to try not to look at my video behind me.
585140	590140	They're just the stupidest, most hilarious things because Skate 3 was kind of cool because
590140	595140	you could actually do tricks and stuff, and you can set up your own ramps and everything.
595140	597140	You can actually move stuff around in the world.
597140	603140	Plus, I have a really cool camera system that you could set up cameras and record replays
603140	607140	and stuff like that, and so he really explains that.
607140	611140	Aren't video games supposed to be a little bit ridiculous at the end of the day?
611140	612140	Isn't that why we love them?
612140	613140	I don't know.
613140	614140	All right.
614140	619140	I'm going to ask for all those people who demand realism.
619140	625140	It says from the same people who like giant enemy crabs.
625140	626140	All right.
626140	630140	I'm sorry, this game does not have enough crabs.
630140	636140	Let's get into our lead topic tonight, which is a very interesting announcement out of
636140	643140	Nintendo that has a lot of people wondering, is this timed with recent E3 announcements?
643140	645140	What's going on here?
645140	647140	Let's dissect this a little bit and see what we think about it.
647140	651140	Loki, do you want to bring us up to speed on what Nintendo put out on the table this week?
651140	656140	Yeah, so Nintendo is doing a Nintendo Live 2023 Seattle.
656140	661140	It's an event that's going to be there that's basically filled with different stage performances.
661140	665140	They're going to have game tournaments, photo ops, and whatnot.
665140	670140	It kind of reminds me of those like Best Buy tours that they used to do, except now
670140	676140	just like in one central location type of thing, which it makes sense that they would
676140	681140	do it in Washington because, you know, the Nintendo North America there.
681140	687140	So, yeah, so they're going to be doing that and it's kind of almost like their own live event.
687140	693140	I imagine it's obviously not as big as it's going to, you know, anything else, but it's
693140	697140	not as big as internet fanboys are already pitching it as, is what you're saying?
697140	699140	Because that's, I think, a very valid concern.
699140	701140	Yes, yes.
701140	705140	Like think the mall tours that they used to do like a while back when malls were a thing.
705140	707140	It's kind of like that.
707140	713140	I think the venue announcement will be very key as to what size they're undertaking here,
713140	719140	because if they are going to the Seattle Convention Center, which I, you know, again,
719140	723140	you know what else is in September in Seattle is PAX West.
723140	725140	I guess it's actually branded as now.
725140	729140	It's not PAX Prime anymore, but it's PAX West is also in September in Seattle.
729140	735140	So I don't see, you know, again, September's, you know, four or five weekends in the month.
735140	739140	So it's not to say that Nintendo couldn't be doing it later in the month, but if they're
739140	744140	doing Labor Day weekend as well, that venue is probably not available.
744140	748140	So I think that the venue announcement will be very important to the scope because they
748140	754140	could also, I mean, you could have PAX going on there and you could have them over at Seattle Center.
754140	758140	You could have where like Space Needle and all that is you could have because Pokemon
758140	760140	Go Fest was over there.
760140	764140	Now, granted, Pokemon Go Fest is mostly outdoors, but Seattle Center does have a large indoor
764140	770140	setup for events that technically this could it could be big enough to hold something like
770140	771140	this for sure.
771140	776140	But I think that's going to be key is like what or is it, you know, the double tree?
776140	778140	Like where where is this at?
778140	783140	It would be very key to what is the scope of this?
783140	789140	I'm surprised that they didn't try to do something like at like their Nintendo Land parks or
789140	794140	Super Mario World parks, whatever those are called, because you would think that that
794140	797140	would be a good way to like, hey, we just put out a movie.
797140	801140	We have these parks, you know, hey, come on down, you know, type of thing.
801140	805140	Like do like a partnership with Universal or something like that.
805140	808140	Well, Loki, I wouldn't I wouldn't write that off.
808140	812140	I wouldn't necessarily write that off because I you know, and I know you kind of brought
812140	817140	that comparison to the mall tour, which, you know, yeah, but there's something about this
817140	819140	that makes me feel like it's a little more than that.
819140	822140	And Bobby and I know he's talking about this on his show and he says in our chat room,
822140	825140	Bobby Blackwell says Space World 2023.
825140	827140	Maybe.
827140	829140	Well, here's the thing.
829140	830140	Here's the thing.
830140	833140	There's a couple there's a couple of ways to go with this.
833140	837140	There's a part of me that's kind of chewing on why this year, because hasn't Nintendo
837140	841140	been pretty open about they don't really have anything for the holiday this year.
841140	846140	Now, I don't know if I necessarily believe that, especially with as big as Mario is this
846140	847140	year.
847140	854140	And it's been how many years since a Mario game like could they not do at the bare minimum
854140	860140	either Super Mario Odyssey 2, Super Luigi Odyssey, hell, Super Peach Odyssey, you know,
860140	862140	in tandem with the movie.
862140	869140	Or even less than that, like, hey, let's just port over Mario Galaxy 2.
869140	875140	That's exactly what or fucking just Super Mario All-Stars 2023, you know, for a new
875140	876140	generation.
876140	877140	That's just a repackaging of all the old shit.
877140	878140	You know what?
878140	881140	If they put a few new things in it, people eat it up.
881140	882140	Fine, whatever.
882140	886140	I'd go for a port of Super Paper Mario because that was awesome.
887140	892140	So, I mean, there could be something in that, you know, but I have to put it out there.
892140	894140	People are going to speculate.
894140	899140	I don't know how much I would hedge my bets on this, but could it be a new system?
899140	902140	Could Nintendo be using this event to launch a new system?
902140	903140	No.
903140	904140	I say they could.
904140	905140	I wouldn't be so quick to write it off.
905140	907140	Why are you so quick to write it off?
907140	911140	Because I don't think that they're going to put more, because to me, this feels like
911140	915140	just the same type of effort that they put in to their tournaments around E3.
915140	919140	I just don't think that they're doing, like, this isn't going to be to launch a new system
919140	924140	because it would be bigger than just Seattle if it was that type of thing.
924140	927140	But see, it could start.
927140	932140	You kind of say that, you know, the theme parks, I could see, and this type of thing
932140	936140	has absolutely happened before with E3 is that they would take their E3 booth and then
936140	938140	they toured around the nation at malls and things like that.
938140	942140	Not the whole booth, but the same demos and builds they were showing in the booth, they
942140	944140	would take around the malls and all that stuff.
944140	949140	So it's not to say that whatever they end up unveiling in September, they can't then
949140	954140	have a couple kiosks at the theme park, have a mall tour on top of that, you know, during
954140	958140	the holidays, especially when whatever this is that they're showing is going to be on
958140	959140	sale.
959140	967140	Like, even though I am not quite convinced it is a new system, there is something they've
967140	969140	got to be announcing with this.
969140	973140	Otherwise, I don't understand the pomp and circumstance of this now.
973140	978140	Now, granted, this is something they could have been planning for 2020 and because of
978140	982140	obviously everything that's happened in the world in 2020 and since then, this is the
982140	986140	first year where they can feel like they could do something like this now.
986140	987140	They haven't been able to do it until now.
987140	994140	So it's hard to say, but I feel like they've got to have something new, even if it's just
994140	998140	a new title for, like we said, a rebranding of an old title, whatever.
998140	1001140	And then they could end up, you know, touring that around or what have you.
1002140	1007140	Dr. Tutsi in chat says, well, there were some rumblings of some new Donkey Kong, supposedly
1007140	1009140	not a country sequel, though.
1009140	1014140	That could be interesting, especially if that is being lined up for the next movie.
1014140	1019140	I know we all say that there's for sure going to be a Super Mario sequel.
1019140	1020140	Absolutely.
1020140	1024140	But with the business that movie continues to do in its second week, still number one
1024140	1031140	at the box office, shut down Nicolas Cage, for God's sake, that movie's got some staying
1031140	1032140	power.
1032140	1039140	So, you know, predicting that a sequel to the Mario movie will happen is the literal
1039140	1041140	safest thing you could predict.
1041140	1043140	Yes, there will be a sequel.
1043140	1049140	But the question really is, which comes out first, the sequel to that or the very clear
1049140	1052140	Donkey Kong spinoff they're also setting up in that movie?
1054140	1055140	Well, it's OK.
1055140	1062140	Next year, we can we can say Academy Award winning Super Mario Brothers movie because
1062140	1065140	what else do you think that song is going to win the best?
1065140	1069140	I think it's going to win best animated picture because what else is coming out?
1069140	1072140	You've got the other.
1072140	1076140	Was it the other Pixar movie coming out, which I just think it's kind of to me, it's just
1076140	1078140	too much like inside out.
1078140	1080140	I don't know if Disney really has any other things.
1080140	1085140	They have the live action Little Mermaid, which is animated, obviously.
1085140	1089140	I don't know what other animated movies are in the pipeline.
1089140	1100140	Foreign film disrupts something out of Japan or another country, the unknown mix to the
1100140	1101140	equation.
1101140	1104140	It's happened before.
1104140	1108140	And Def says Disney does have a movie later in the year, if I recall correctly.
1108140	1109140	So it'll be interesting.
1109140	1110140	I don't know.
1110140	1114140	I could see that the song gets nominated because there's certainly a lot of buzz around that,
1114140	1115140	which is kind of surprised me.
1115140	1118140	Like I kind of found those articles a bit click baity at first.
1118140	1121140	But then I remembered fucking what was that song?
1121140	1124140	Man or a Muppet fucking won an Oscar.
1124140	1126140	Remember that from the Muppets movie?
1126140	1128140	Am I a man?
1128140	1130140	Am I a Muppet?
1130140	1132140	That song won the fucking Oscar.
1132140	1134140	So it's possible.
1134140	1138140	Like I can't sit here and say that song would never get nominated because Blame Canada was
1138140	1139140	nominated.
1139140	1140140	Remember that?
1140140	1141140	Robin Williams sang Blame Canada that one year.
1141140	1142140	That was amazing.
1142140	1143140	Yep.
1143140	1146140	So I would say it's more than possible.
1146140	1148140	I think that Peaches song does get nominated, but we'll see.
1148140	1149140	We'll see what happens.
1149140	1150140	All right.
1150140	1152140	But anyway, back to the Nintendo live event.
1152140	1155140	There's another very important part of this that I wanted to address.
1155140	1158140	And that was the fact that they're talking about tournaments.
1158140	1165140	That's key to me right there because Nintendo, these last few years since pandemic lockdowns
1165140	1172140	and even kind of the ramp up into before COVID disrupted everything, Nintendo was kind
1172140	1177140	of infamous for shutting down and pulling Smash GameCube out of a lot of these tournaments
1177140	1178140	and things.
1178140	1184140	And really Evo kind of ended up not having Smash anymore because some of this Nintendo
1184140	1187140	stuff and they were pushing everything through Panda.
1187140	1192140	Long story short, Nintendo's really disrupted the tournament scene because supposedly they're
1192140	1194140	supposed to be doing their own official thing.
1195140	1202140	So this is, and I could see that maybe if Nintendo is just going full blown esports
1202140	1206140	with this, this could also explain the why now for this.
1206140	1210140	That they're going to set up a major Smash tournament and maybe other Nintendo games
1210140	1212140	too, type of tournament with this.
1212140	1216140	I would say it's their one chance to maybe get back some goodwill of all the bridges
1216140	1220140	they burned by shutting down or asking these Smash tournaments to change and so forth and
1220140	1222140	all the things that were going on there.
1222140	1226140	This is a chance for them to, I don't know if they can get some of that goodwill back
1226140	1229140	in some places, but it's a start.
1229140	1235140	If this shows justification for why they've been doing what they've been doing, it would
1235140	1236140	be interesting.
1238140	1239140	But we'll see.
1241140	1244140	So yeah, the question is, does anyone actually want to go?
1246140	1247140	For me, it depends on what weekend.
1247140	1256140	Ironically, there's an Ingress thing happening in Tacoma, which obviously is just, you know,
1256140	1258140	it's the Sea-Tac airport up there, right?
1258140	1259140	You go north, it's Seattle.
1259140	1260140	You go south, it's Tacoma.
1260140	1262140	Well, west-ish, but still.
1264140	1268140	I was going to maybe go to an Ingress event up there, but it's the week after Dragon Con.
1269140	1274140	And that's a lot of work for me because literally I'd be coming back on a Tuesday from Dragon,
1274140	1275140	no, I fly on a Tuesday.
1275140	1279140	I'd be coming back on a Wednesday to work, and then I'd be leaving again on a Thursday.
1279140	1281140	So it's like, I might as well just take two full weeks off of work.
1281140	1284140	And at that point, it's like, ooh, that's a lot of work to miss.
1284140	1285140	So I don't know.
1285140	1286140	We also don't know what day it is.
1286140	1287140	No, we don't.
1287140	1288140	We don't.
1288140	1292140	I'm just saying, if it was this particular weekend, I kind of was already going to go
1292140	1294140	thinking of going to Seattle anyway.
1294140	1297140	This might push me over the edge to just make that happen, but we'll see.
1298140	1299140	We'll see.
1300140	1301140	All right.
1301140	1306140	Let's move on and talk about what we have been doing this week in How Was Your Gaming
1306140	1307140	Week?
1307140	1308140	So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1308140	1310140	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1310140	1311140	How was your gaming week?
1311140	1315140	I played Dead by Daylight.
1315140	1318140	I played Marvel's Midnight Suns.
1318140	1321140	I've done my wordscapes.
1321140	1326140	I played some Beatles today, which we are going to buy that one when we figure out how
1326140	1332140	to swing that and Weird Al.
1332140	1338140	And of course, I'm doing my bar stuff.
1338140	1344140	It's not really a game, but I'm sort of competing with myself for it to see what I can do to
1344140	1345140	get better.
1345140	1350140	And I've been debating hooking back up my DDR stuff.
1350140	1351140	Oh, nice.
1351140	1352140	Nice.
1353140	1361140	It's so funny, since I've started doing bar work and a lot of extra stretching, I hurt
1361140	1365140	worse if I don't do it now.
1365140	1367140	So it's easier for me.
1367140	1376140	I've been actually stretching during playing games, and I'll sit with my legs in the log
1376140	1381140	stack pose just to stretch while I'm playing a game.
1381140	1389140	So I was actually trying to see if anyone had gamified yoga or something, apart from
1389140	1390140	Wii Sports.
1390140	1391140	Good question.
1391140	1393140	I don't know if I've seen it.
1393140	1394140	You're right.
1394140	1395140	Yeah, it's funny.
1395140	1399140	Wii Fit, but yes, was gamifying yoga, but yeah.
1399140	1403140	I'm looking for something a little bit more my speed.
1403140	1408140	No, but gamifying exercise absolutely is a very good motivator.
1408140	1409140	It really worked for me.
1409140	1410140	It really did.
1410140	1413140	Having nothing else to do during the pandemic also helped, but you know.
1413140	1420140	I'm really reluctant to play a Niantic game because I'm just not happy with what they've
1420140	1421140	done.
1421140	1423140	I don't blame you.
1423140	1424140	I'm not going to defend them.
1424140	1431140	There's not really many out there other than maybe going back to playing Orna, but I don't
1431140	1432140	know.
1432140	1434140	I'll think of something.
1434140	1440140	I do like Orna, and I love that it's an indie, but I feel like the real world elements are
1440140	1441140	secondary in that game.
1441140	1444140	That's my only issue with that game.
1444140	1447140	But whatever works, right?
1447140	1450140	If it gets you to go to new areas, whatever works.
1450140	1455140	I just more want something that's going to give me incentive to walk to a place and do
1455140	1458140	something rather than drive right by the place and do something.
1458140	1461140	What about geocaching?
1461140	1463140	It's not technically a game.
1463140	1466140	I mean, I guess it is a game, and there's a lot of apps around geocaching.
1466140	1467140	I don't know.
1467140	1468140	I don't know.
1468140	1469140	I don't know.
1469140	1470140	I thought there were either.
1470140	1473140	I'm not going to use a Fitbit when I have an Apple Watch.
1473140	1477140	Why would I do that?
1477140	1486140	However, I have been using my workout mode on my watch to make sure I'm doing at least
1486140	1490140	30 minutes, so I guess it's kind of like achievement unlocked.
1490140	1499140	That's how I've kind of made a game out of it, was if I change my averages.
1499140	1507140	I know I've leveled up, and my stair average went from six flights on a day on average
1507140	1509140	to 11.
1509140	1516140	So I'm kind of using that sort of as like, I even sometimes I'll hear the Final Fantasy
1516140	1522140	fanfare in my head when something has changed on there.
1522140	1529140	I've already updated my ambient calories that I burned for the day because it's more.
1529140	1536140	It's been a big game for me, just like a big game.
1536140	1542140	I'm going to patent that part of the idea.
1542140	1549140	Then again, I think NerdFit already did it, but have achievement systems and things like
1549140	1553140	that where you are gaining personal levels.
1553140	1557140	It's been fun, actually.
1557140	1559140	Very fun.
1559140	1565140	I was sort of hoping I had a game that would fit my style of how I wanted to do this.
1565140	1574140	I mean, I could go try Wii Fit again, you know, but I don't know.
1574140	1580140	It felt like a little bit of work to do that when I'm already on the clock bringing out all my equipment now.
1580140	1585140	Honestly, you've got to hook the Wii U back up when there's not a lot else.
1585140	1586140	It's still hooked up.
1586140	1588140	Oh, okay. Well, that's convenient.
1588140	1592140	And the Switch, and the PS3, and the PS4.
1592140	1594140	Well, right then.
1594140	1596140	And I think the PSTV is as well.
1596140	1598140	We had that for a hot minute.
1598140	1602140	But yeah, Ring Fit Adventure wasn't so much fun for me.
1602140	1604140	And I'm doing a lot more than yoga.
1604140	1606140	I'm doing kettlebells.
1606140	1611140	But the bar stuff is the butt kicker, literally.
1611140	1617140	I know now why ballerinas are ridiculously skinny and flexible.
1617140	1621140	Just getting started with some of those.
1621140	1626140	Like, oh my god, plie de relevé.
1626140	1634140	I'm like, my butt is going to be made out of cast iron by the end of the month.
1634140	1636140	You know what a plie is, right?
1636140	1638140	No. I don't.
1638140	1641140	It's when you're sort of doing a squat with your feet together.
1641140	1646140	And then relevé is when you're coming up on your tiptoes.
1646140	1651140	Imagine going from a half squat to your tiptoes and doing that on repeat.
1651140	1654140	Okay, I've seen that done, yeah.
1654140	1657140	Yeah, I'm going to have...
1657140	1663140	It's not going to be iron, but it's going to be something.
1663140	1664140	Maybe not iron.
1664140	1666140	Because that would be too magnetic.
1666140	1668140	And I don't let anyone in my butt.
1668140	1671140	But gamifying exercise is a good way to motivate on that.
1671140	1673140	Yeah, and so that's how I'm seeing it.
1673140	1674140	For me, it's a game.
1674140	1675140	So I'm including it.
1676140	1678140	Well, let's go to some other video games.
1678140	1680140	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1680140	1684140	My gaming week was filled with Minecraft again.
1684140	1686140	So I had a stream day yesterday.
1686140	1690140	And I streamed early in the morning.
1690140	1694140	And then, of course, we had the rest of the channel, 64 people carrying out throughout the day.
1694140	1696140	So that was fun. Moved some villagers around.
1696140	1702140	I also went to the Capital Creative Showcase down in West Sacramento.
1702140	1704140	So I got to check out some indie games there.
1704140	1706140	I didn't know you went, too.
1706140	1709140	I know you did because Brianna told me.
1709140	1711140	I didn't know you went, too.
1711140	1712140	I was just about to talk about it as well.
1712140	1714140	I said it when you were talking about it earlier.
1714140	1716140	No, I thought...
1716140	1718140	I shouldn't know. I had to work.
1718140	1720140	No, she had told me you weren't going because of the stream.
1720140	1721140	And I knew you were doing the stream.
1721140	1723140	I was like, oh, yeah, I was there in the morning.
1723140	1724140	That's funny.
1724140	1726140	Yeah, I said I tried to make it.
1726140	1732140	But, yeah, it was just like it was between piano practice for the kids.
1732140	1741140	It's not a wedding dinner, but it was like a dinner congratulating my sister-in-law for getting married type of thing.
1741140	1743140	So it was like in between.
1743140	1745140	I was like, I don't know if I have enough time to do that.
1745140	1747140	But, yeah, I managed to fit it in.
1747140	1751140	So, yeah, we went for like an hour and I got to play a few things.
1751140	1759140	I think my favorite one, though, there had been Shellout Showdown, which is kind of a really quirky game.
1759140	1761140	It's really fast paced.
1761140	1765140	It's sort of a little bit like Smash Brothers in the setup that it's like a single stage.
1765140	1767140	I saw that one. I know exactly which one this is. Yeah.
1767140	1771140	But you play different vending machines or food carts or whatever.
1771140	1777140	And the object of the game is to throw all of your food to one of the other players.
1777140	1779140	Now, I can't just land on the ground.
1779140	1780140	You have to pick it up if it lands on the ground.
1780140	1788140	But you throw it into the inventory of another player and then you have to stay away from them for like five seconds or something to win the match.
1788140	1792140	And when you do that with like a couple of players, I think it's like four player co-op.
1792140	1796140	And then you can do like a bunch of CPU players as well.
1796140	1802140	It gets crazy. So I had a lot of them playing that one.
1802140	1805140	I don't remember. Oh, I also played what was the other one?
1805140	1810140	It was the cat or a cappuccino in that cappuccino.
1810140	1814140	It was the mocha mania, mocha mania.
1814140	1816140	Yeah, it's on my list, too. Yeah.
1816140	1825140	Yeah. So mocha mania is supposed to be like a Donkey Kong type of game with like a little there's a coffee that's like throwing coffee up into the air.
1825140	1830140	And you're trying to like gather like items and stuff like that to calm the coffee down.
1830140	1832140	There's like a few stages there. So that's pretty cool.
1832140	1839140	I didn't know that was actually out. I don't know if you talk to the developer at all, but that one's actually out on the trailer.
1839140	1843140	Yeah. So that's the trailer. It said it came out last year. So that's cool.
1843140	1848140	And then there was this one game that I remember was called that was like restructure or something like that.
1848140	1852140	I think it basically reboxed or something.
1852140	1863140	It kind of reminded me of like a puzzle, a first person puzzle platformer game that similar to kind of like a portal or something like that, obviously without portals.
1863140	1867140	And you pick up these different cubes that have different powers.
1867140	1870140	So as you're holding a certain cube, you have a certain power.
1870140	1877140	I was trying to figure out what was I didn't get a chance to play that game because there was always somebody on it, but it was very attractive graphically.
1877140	1881140	Yeah. Yeah, it was really cool. So my kids played that and it looked pretty neat.
1881140	1888140	And then I played cobalt tactics because it's my wife's friend's husband that's putting that out.
1888140	1892140	So I checked it out and I broke the game immediately.
1892140	1893140	It wasn't on purpose.
1893140	1899140	Well, that's the interesting thing about this showcase. It's a chance for the deal because they're all mostly local.
1899140	1905140	I mean, I noticed like Bay Area, but I would still call that relatively local ish, you know, all these developers and things that are.
1905140	1909140	But a lot of them are getting their games in front of people for the first time.
1909140	1913140	And for some, you know, because again, even events like this have been virtual for the last.
1913140	1918140	This is the first year they've done this event back in person, you know, for obvious reasons.
1918140	1924140	Right. And I know that they were doing a virtual event, but, you know, I was even talking to some of the developers about this.
1924140	1928140	It's one thing to kind of get that feedback and everybody saying, oh, great.
1928140	1937140	Yeah, looks good. You know, but then to actually see somebody playing the game and see where they struggle, see where they're thinking, see where the game's outsmarting them and all this stuff.
1937140	1946140	And most importantly, you know, where they're breaking it in ways you haven't thought of is such important, valuable feedback for these folks that are making the game.
1946140	1948140	So it's it goes with the territory.
1948140	1950140	Yeah, no, it's fine.
1950140	1952140	Yeah, it's no slight on any of the developers.
1953140	1955140	Yeah, so it was interesting.
1955140	1961140	It was pretty low key. We went, like I said, towards later in the afternoon, so it wasn't super crowded.
1961140	1966140	But I mean, they had like, you know, I was telling Brianna, I wish you'd taken Pixel Poops number two.
1966140	1972140	Yeah, I wanted to like if it was like this, just the timing wasn't good for that.
1972140	1980140	But yeah, for sure. But I wanted to like a few years ago when it was they were talking maybe of being in person, but then it was digital type of thing.
1980140	1984140	So but yeah, I would totally bring it because that'd be fun. I think people have a blast of that.
1985140	1995140	Yeah, nice. Well, let me piggyback on that, because I also went to the Capital Creative Showcase here locally, which was so those of them that have been listening to OLR a while.
1995140	1997140	So you probably have to go back definitely pre pandemic.
1997140	2003140	You need to go back to the era where we were all taping in person and we would have guests in studio.
2003140	2009140	And we a couple times had some guests from at the time it was the IGDA.
2009140	2013140	And one of those guests was Brianna that worked with the IGDA.
2013140	2017140	We've kept in touch on socials over the years. Obviously, the pandemic happened. It disrupted everything.
2017140	2023140	And along the way, just for whatever reason, I don't have all the notes behind it.
2023140	2030140	But, you know, creatively, the group here in Sacramento is now the Game Developers Collective, the GDC here in Sacramento.
2030140	2040140	So this was their event, the Capital Creative Showcase to basically showcase what the local pool of talent in the area is making.
2040140	2042140	And this is so far as like their game jams.
2042140	2049140	I think one of the big things they like to do is these progressive game jams where they kind of put a group together and they've all been working on a game collectively for the last few months.
2049140	2057140	And it's, you know, and as I was mentioning with Loki a minute ago, this is a great chance for them to get feedback and see people play their games live.
2057140	2067140	Right. But what really impressed me too, they also had folks from like high schools and colleges and the things that people make in high school today.
2067140	2076140	What? Like, yeah, but I was I was kind of reminiscing with somebody about like, OK, for and Loki, you would definitely know this one.
2076140	2081140	And Jamie, you've heard us talk enough about it. That's for sure. When we were the ones in high school, it was all ZZT.
2081140	2084140	That was the games we were making were in that game.
2084140	2088140	It was all people programming games into their graphing calculators.
2088140	2090140	Yes, graphing calculators.
2090140	2098140	Or even, you know, and I kind of look back and I go, they never taught us game development school. They didn't teach us this programming stuff at school, actually.
2098140	2107140	But I'm wrong. They often, so the times you would go to the computer lab and many of us associate it with like the Oregon Trail and Number Munchers back in the day.
2107140	2113140	We used to do like logo and the very simple programming, the turtle program. Right.
2113140	2117140	Like pan down, forward 30, right 90.
2117140	2121140	You know, it's the whole thing like draw the things that was learning programming.
2121140	2123140	But it's the bouncing ball that made music.
2123140	2130140	Yes. But we've basic or Rocky's boots, you know, a real deep cut on learning how to program.
2130140	2132140	Right. For the same people that brought you Oregon Trail.
2132140	2139140	But I digress. Like, obviously, so we've had programming in school, luckily for a while now, but obviously it's not at the same.
2139140	2142140	It wasn't at the same level then than it is now.
2142140	2147140	And the tools that, you know, Unity and.
2147140	2149140	It was funny.
2149140	2152140	Yeah, Roblox. All that is bringing a table.
2152140	2160140	I have a friend with her Fortran punch cards, laminated them and made lampshades out of them.
2160140	2165140	Yes. And unreal. Yes, that was the one that escaped my time. Thank you Akuma JP.
2165140	2171140	Pencil boxes out of three, three and a half inch floppies.
2171140	2173140	Let's see. So the other game.
2173140	2182140	So the one game that I saw all the ones you were talking about, Loki, the one I had on my list to shout out that you didn't shout out was a chess game that I saw.
2182140	2185140	It was a twist on chess called Board of the Kings.
2185140	2187140	And I was impressed by this game for two reasons.
2187140	2190140	One, I believe I picked up.
2190140	2197140	They are one of the progressive game jam groups who was put together by this association, and they've only been working on this for six months.
2197140	2203140	And I was I was very impressed at how robust their part time to because they all they all have normal lives in this game.
2203140	2207140	Game thing is part time. I was very impressed by what they put together in six months.
2207140	2216140	And basically it's, you know, it's chess, but they put a little spin on it where like you can choose a power up to bring into a chess match.
2216140	2230140	So the one I picked like was something like reverse polarity or polarity shift or something, which allows the bishop so many times a match to move up, down, left or right one square as opposed to diagonal.
2230140	2232140	So that was a power up you could bring in.
2232140	2236140	But you could also you know, you could also do a power up for your pawns.
2236140	2239140	You could do a power up for it. And they had these different things they were putting out there.
2239140	2243140	And they were talking about all these features they're looking at developing, you know, because, again, they've only been at it for six months.
2243140	2248140	But the other thing that they did different from anyone else I saw it.
2248140	2251140	I don't know if this is your experience, Loki. Again, it could be a morning versus afternoon.
2251140	2261140	I'm not saying no one else did this, but it's just something that I was like, if you're an indie game developer out there and you're going to take your game to a show and get that feedback of people playing it.
2261140	2271140	This is something that group did absolutely right. And that is they had one of their team members out there asking people to go play their game.
2271140	2277140	Because everybody else was kind of that I saw at the moment. And again, this isn't a slide on anyone.
2277140	2282140	This is just one of those like this was a this was a right move that I think a lot of folks can learn from.
2282140	2289140	One thing that they did was they had the recruiter gal was, you know, going out and very much, hey, do you want to come up and play this game?
2289140	2295140	Because a lot of times when you're at these expos, you see people that are kind of like, you know, on the computer.
2295140	2301140	But it could be the programmer that's like trying to reset the game or they're showing something to a friend or something.
2301140	2313140	You know, the thing that this person did right was they were really encouraging spectators to get in there and actually play the game and solicit that valuable feedback of a stranger playing the game.
2313140	2319140	And also, you know, you never know who it's going to be like. I'm not I'm not going to toot my own horn here.
2319140	2323140	I know this podcast is not that big a deal. We're not like a major influence or anything like that.
2323140	2331140	But here I am now talking about that game on the program when I might not have done that had I not been cordially invited to sit down and play the game.
2331140	2336140	So I just wanted to throw that out there to any potential game developer out there.
2336140	2341140	If that is something that, you know, you're looking at doing is how do you get your game out there?
2341140	2347140	If you aren't comfortable doing that, get a friend who is, because very obviously that team probably was like you.
2347140	2351140	You're really good at getting people to do that type of stuff. You're the extrovert. You do it.
2351140	2357140	And she did a great job with that. So I just want to call that out for potential other people developing their games later on.
2357140	2362140	My understanding was they also were having video game tournaments and speakers during this thing in that theater.
2362140	2365140	Remember the first year they did it there? We were there.
2365140	2371140	Yeah. And it wasn't set up when I was there. I didn't see any of that. So I missed it.
2371140	2377140	They had that tournament, but it was like over. And then we went upstairs, but there's like nothing there. So I don't know.
2377140	2381140	Yeah. So it's fine. I know it was their first year back and they're still trying to get a feel for things.
2381140	2388140	I noticed the back part where like the cafe was, was kind of unused too. And I'm sure in the future they'll want to use that space.
2388140	2393140	But, you know, again, it's the first time back. I'm very proud of, you know, what they did put together.
2393140	2397140	And I would encourage folks out there, you know, we do have listeners throughout the country and even internationally.
2397140	2402140	Chances are if you're in a major city or anywhere close to a major city, somewhere in America,
2402140	2410140	you probably have a collection of, or a collective of independent developers of your own who are putting on these type of shows for 10, 15 bucks.
2410140	2417140	I'd really encourage you to go and check out what the locals are doing. Remember, you're not going to be playing the latest and greatest Nintendo product,
2417140	2422140	but you might be seeing the next big thing. You might be looking at something where you're like,
2422140	2427140	oh, that's a fun snack cart delivery fighting game. That's awesome.
2427140	2432140	Yeah. You see neat ideas that you wouldn't have thought of before. It's just neat.
2432140	2437140	And there's some pretty polished games there. Like some of the ones we've mentioned in the past, like Monsters of the Monocles,
2437140	2442140	they had there for a few years. There is a game that came out called Black Future 88.
2442140	2449140	That's just fantastic. Yeah, check it out. That one game I was playing, yeah,
2449140	2454140	the Shellout Showdown is actually out on Steam right now. You can check it out. It's pretty awesome.
2454140	2459140	So, and they have a free demo. Free demo is good.
2459140	2461140	Yeah, lots of it, sir.
2461140	2465140	Let's see, sg100matt with an excellent point here saying,
2465140	2471140	I mean, Marble Madness was made with a small team that included Mark Cerny, who apparently was really young when he did it.
2471140	2480140	Yeah, you never know when you might be playing the next Stardew Valley or the next Five Nights at Freddy's or the next Undertale.
2480140	2489140	You know, these were all huge games created by one or maybe a very small team of people, you know.
2489140	2493140	But yeah, I just it was it was it was a good show. I had a good time.
2493140	2496140	There's also I also had on my list there were crafting tables I saw. I don't know.
2496140	2499140	I didn't see a lot of like video game related things.
2499140	2504140	I figured these were probably folks who were friends or relatives of some of the game developers who dabbled in arts and crafts.
2504140	2515140	I saw some neat stuff, though, and I was actually very happy to see that like everybody was selling like LGBTQIA++, you name it, across the spec.
2515140	2526140	Like all the tables I saw had whatever they were selling was like in rainbow or pan or ace or agender, trans, like what you name it was like available in those types of colors.
2526140	2532140	And I just it makes me so happy for the youth today that we're embracing those types of things.
2532140	2536140	The kids, they're going to be OK, but it really did.
2536140	2539140	If we can keep the old people from fucking it up.
2539140	2542140	That the truth. But yeah, it did warm my little heart.
2542140	2546140	And yeah, so yeah, again, these are probably happening in your town somewhere.
2546140	2551140	I know we can only talk about Sacramento because that's where we're based, but I'm sure these are happening in your town somewhere.
2551140	2554140	Check it out. Go play a game you've never heard of.
2554140	2560140	And if nothing else, you're giving a game developer feedback in one of the best possible ways.
2560140	2564140	So don't go in expecting a polished demo.
2564140	2568140	Things will break. But that's the point. You're there to break them and help.
2568140	2571140	I remember seeing Killer Bee when it was new.
2571140	2572140	Yeah.
2572140	2574140	Was it gamer X, wasn't it?
2574140	2575140	Mm hmm.
2575140	2578140	Yeah. And then now they're freaking everywhere.
2578140	2580140	Yeah. Killer Queen, I think, is that one, right?
2580140	2581140	Yeah. Yeah.
2581140	2587140	Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says you also might meet people who get big in the industry later.
2587140	2596140	There was someone at our local indie game stuff that sounds a lot like this who then became one of the narrative designer leads for this little game called Diablo four.
2596140	2598140	Right. Why are these folks passionate about what they do?
2598140	2603140	Many of them want to turn it into careers, especially those that are coming from the high school and college.
2603140	2606140	You don't know who you might be meeting.
2606140	2607140	Yeah.
2607140	2609140	Quest Buster. Excellent point here.
2609140	2616140	Richard Garriott, aka Lord British, was still in high school when he created Akalabeth.
2616140	2624140	I think I'm saying that right. In basic, which eventually, of course, led to Ultima and, you know, the games that he got very famous for later on.
2624140	2625140	So very good point.
2625140	2641140	The folks who are responsible for bringing us Star Fox originally, you know, they they started off by doing something that no one thought could be done, which was bypassing Nintendo's
2641140	2647140	lock and making their own Game Boy dev kit and then running 3D on a Game Boy.
2647140	2649140	Yeah. Yeah.
2649140	2660140	You know, you never know. And for anyone who, you know, plays in, you know, indie games or might have developed like a little thing here and there, bring it on.
2660140	2662140	You don't know who you will be.
2662140	2666140	Yeah. Anyway, I would invite you know, I need to make it.
2666140	2676140	Now that we're coming back in person again, I need to make a note to hold an ear to the wall a little more at what some of these folks are doing, because I'd be happy to have many of them on the show.
2676140	2685140	When they have a product ready for the masses, because obviously we can't really promote something that, you know, our listenership can't really do anything about.
2685140	2691140	But like you mentioned, Loki, a lot of these games you were checking out are available on Steam or itch.io and so forth.
2691140	2695140	So, you know, why not? I love to support the indie folks.
2695140	2701140	We've we've hyped up enough of our indie friends of our own between, you know, YYR and everything that he's been doing.
2701140	2709140	Pixel Poop is number two. We, you know, we all know people that are making games and we want to we want to help them out, you know, especially when the games are something we're all very proud of.
2709140	2716140	So. All right. So props to the SAC Dev Collective and the Capital Creative Showcase.
2716140	2719140	I wish I could have stayed the whole day. What's that?
2719140	2720140	I wish I could have gone.
2720140	2730140	Yeah. Next year. Next year. We'll know next year a little more advanced notice probably that it's, you know, because I want to say when they were doing it before, it was around the tax weekend is kind of what I call this weekend.
2730140	2736140	It was around tax or I guess I should say Jamie's birthday week. It was around Jamie's birthday week every year.
2736140	2740140	And really, I'm just waiting for someone to make a game of me.
2740140	2749140	Well, I mean, you got your dream games, Jamie. YYR made Bungie Verit tossing a reality. So I get a little greedy over there.
2749140	2764140	I need to star in a game. I think that I now in my in my not Twilight years have earned my place where we need Orange Nails Radio the game.
2764140	2768140	What would you we had Orange Nails Radio the game somebody made a text adventure way back in the day. Remember?
2768140	2777140	I'm meaning I mean that we have to have like a full on RPG.
2777140	2783140	Where we have to battle obscurity and bills.
2783140	2789140	What would happen in your game? What would happen? What would your superpower be in the Jamie video game?
2789140	2790140	Spite.
2790140	2791140	Spite?
2791140	2796140	Spite.
2796140	2798140	I would I would have the power of spite.
2798140	2799140	It's a powerful thing.
2799140	2804140	Where I could do where I could do something someone said I couldn't do.
2804140	2813140	I will point this out, like in all seriousness, you know, something that I'm constantly reminded, I thought we were done with this topic, but we're not.
2813140	2819140	And that's but that's OK, because this is this is a positive. This is truly a net positive talking about this local and indie game development.
2819140	2833140	One thing that I often forget is that even if you're not interested in programming or you don't think you can program or you don't want to program, there's still probably a space in game development for you somewhere.
2834140	2838140	Built into Epic or into Unreal and into Unity.
2838140	2841140	That's block based coding that you can do.
2841140	2843140	You don't even need to know programming language.
2843140	2844140	You can do that.
2844140	2845140	Yes.
2845140	2850140	I'm thinking about I'm thinking about Dark Sakura does music.
2850140	2851140	She creates music for her streams.
2851140	2852140	Right.
2852140	2855140	And I was overhearing the conversation.
2855140	2860140	I was overhearing conversation for one of the game developers about outsourced music that they were doing for their game.
2860140	2864140	And I was like, oh, you know, they got to do what they got to do to get what they need for their game.
2864140	2877140	But, you know, it just kind of shows like, oh, maybe if they were able to connect with some local musicians who might I'm not saying I'm not volunteering Dark Sakura for that, but I'm using her as an example of you might not know where the musical talent is around here locally.
2877140	2889140	So even folks who aren't necessarily interested in the programing, if you're interested in art, if you're interested in hell, just testing, for God's sake, writing your story goes into this.
2889140	2896140	I know this is something the chess game was working on is that they're going to be making a whole narrative around it and all that, which I don't want to keep calling it the chess game.
2896140	2898140	I want to I want to give it its its real do.
2898140	2903140	I know they were RP Chess on Twitter was their handle.
2903140	2913140	But this was there's there's room for all sorts of different creative stuff within game development.
2913140	2919140	To work with people and and make like, I mean, I'm not good for more than just little little loops.
2919140	2926140	You know, that's kind of my jam and some like I have a MIDI keyboard, but I can't play piano.
2926140	2934140	But I can type out a rhythm and then go into Logic Pro and adjust the MIDI to be the right notes and velocity and whatnot.
2934140	2940140	So, I mean, and I I've done plenty of creative writing.
2940140	2944140	You know, I would love to come up with a concept and have somebody execute it for me.
2944140	2948140	All right. Now, now it's out there in the universe.
2948140	2950140	All right. Well, let's move on for now.
2950140	2952140	We've got to speak in the industry.
2952140	2957140	We've got to talk about what's going on in the larger worldwide game industry with the week's news.
2957140	2959140	We've had a lot of things going on this week.
2959140	2965140	So let's get to Loki continuing on with another Nintendo story, right?
2965140	2979140	Yep. So we talked last week how Nintendo was coming after Point Crow for the Zelda Breath of the Wild mods that he was showcasing, the multiplayer mod.
2979140	2988140	Now they're coming after his channel for any mods he has, because he's done a lot of different mods for Breath of the Wild and other games.
2988140	2992140	And they have been copyright claiming all of them.
2992140	2996140	Somebody stocked the kitchen at Nintendo with lots of petty crocker.
2996140	2999140	Even stuff that has nothing to do with modified gameplay.
2999140	3004140	It just may sound like it's modded. Then they're claiming that as well, which I don't think that's right.
3004140	3012140	But yeah, so they, of course, Point Crow put out a video or put out a video about the whole situation as well.
3012140	3018140	And also tweeted that just put out a video going over the takedowns that Nintendo of America has issued on my YouTube channel.
3018140	3021140	Please go give it a watch. It's incredibly important.
3021140	3030140	And he also asked for, you know, please remove these strikes and claims or at least start a dialogue with us so we can all move forward with excitement.
3030140	3032140	I'm sure you'd love to see that about your now that lawyers don't care.
3032140	3037140	I mean, honestly, like they're just going to make all the bad decisions that they want.
3038140	3040140	There's another content creator as well.
3040140	3048140	Croton, who has they said Nintendo's new 10 of my streams and two of my videos off the face of the platform.
3048140	3051140	No answer, no context, just copyright removal.
3051140	3054140	And one of these videos has literally nothing to do with mods.
3054140	3058140	It's a simply Zelda challenge run.
3058140	3063140	So, yeah, some intern somewhere is flagging these without watching them, apparently, too.
3063140	3074140	So that that great use of our copyright system that it can be weaponized like this by companies and corporations because they have lawyers and they can do that kind of stuff.
3074140	3077140	So that's fun thing.
3077140	3080140	And to go along with that, a completely different story.
3080140	3089140	You may remember there was that whole art book that leaked for Tears of a Kingdom, and apparently it came from a Discord channel.
3089140	3098140	And so now Nintendo has decided to subpoena Discord to try to identify the person who leaked the information.
3098140	3101140	Discord's not having a good week in the leaks department, are they?
3101140	3102140	They are not.
3102140	3104140	But I think this is the minor of the two.
3104140	3108140	They're well within their rights on something like this.
3108140	3111140	I mean, I can't fault them for that.
3111140	3113140	It's just ridiculous.
3113140	3115140	I mean, like, yeah, I get it like that.
3115140	3116140	They can come.
3116140	3122140	But like, what harm did it really do aside from like, I don't know, it's just silly, but whatever.
3122140	3129140	How many people who would have bought that book aren't buying it now because it's out there for free?
3129140	3131140	It would depend on the quality.
3131140	3136140	It was an art book that was part of a collector's edition, I think.
3136140	3144140	Well, on top of that, too, you know, if you've got the artwork for it, what incentive are you going to have to pay the extra money to get the collector's edition?
3144140	3146140	How do people buy collector's editions?
3146140	3149140	I think people would have bought the collector's edition even if the art book leaked.
3149140	3151140	I mean, they still are, obviously.
3151140	3154140	No one's canceling because they're like, oh, I've seen all the artwork now.
3154140	3155140	I mean, you're going to play the game.
3155140	3156140	You're going to see all the artwork anyways.
3156140	3167140	I would agree Nintendo's within their rights to do what they need to do here because this is a little more of a straight up copyright crime, whereas the other one I'm not on their side with.
3167140	3169140	The mods and that stuff.
3170140	3192140	But for for artwork, especially as an artist myself, you know, if any of my work that I had intended on putting out there to make money with was, you know, being traded without my permission, then, yeah, I'd go, you know, do anything that I could to get it back.
3192140	3197140	I mean, prevent other people from, you know, taking it outside of its intended use.
3197140	3211140	For sure. And I get that. And we just have to see where it leaked from because if it was from a retailer, which to my question of you, like, why are you shipping the art books that damn early? Like, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
3211140	3219140	And I do understand that is that how much of this is Nintendo's own kind of carelessness, right?
3219140	3241140	I mean, it could be a printer or something, I would think that's pretty easy to track at that point. Yeah, who, who leaked it? It's not like, Oh, I don't know who leaked it. Like, like, you have a chain of custody for that kind of stuff, you know, okay, well, you know, obviously, they're not shipping the art book, like months early. That's not a thing that happens.
3241140	3262140	So it, it would be interesting to see, like, I mean, sure, yeah, we could get down to like, figure out who exactly did it. But like, I don't know, I don't think you even need the subpoena discord for it. But sure. I mean, subpoena, whatever. I mean, you'll have the IP, I guess, and their email address, probably the name, maybe.
3263140	3283140	Well, it is worth pointing out that there was also, you know, kind of, I guess the final Tears of the Kingdom trailer or, you know, latest major trailer for the game that also released this week that shows a little bit of voice acting out. It was a really good trailer, I gotta say I was a little like kind of thrown like, Whoa, Zelda's actually voice acted. That's
3283140	3285140	I mean, the last one was too.
3285140	3291140	I just don't I don't mind. It's been so long as I played that game. I don't even remember it. Like I'm so used to Nintendo not doing that. You know what I mean?
3291140	3292140	Blood moon rises.
3292140	3293140	Yeah, that's right.
3293140	3300140	Yeah, there was plenty of dialogue in that game. There was the the king and there was Yeah.
3301140	3310140	It was impressive to see, you know, Chris Pratt really take on the role of Princess Zelda. I wouldn't think he had it in him. But like, I was very impressed by that.
3310140	3333140	I liked the memes I started seeing on Twitter right after that, that were things like me whenever I scan a QR code, and it's just the little video where the Zelda's going link. I don't know, things like that are really funny to me. Maybe I'm just entering my full dad era, but whatever. All right.
3334140	3346140	One of my favorite YouTubers, Zeltik, did a full breakdown. But I had to leave feedback on it because he was confusing the concept of a gachapon and a pachinko machine.
3347140	3355140	As like, the little things full of balls. There's not pachinko. Those are gachapon. Get it right, dude.
3357140	3358140	All right.
3358140	3359140	Yeah.
3359140	3375140	Well, Zelda was not the only game to get a deep dive trailer this week. We also had the latest Final Fantasy 16. So PlayStation actually did an entire state of play for Final Fantasy 16.
3376140	3392140	And they were actually showing the latest and greatest going on in this game, which includes a deep dive on how some of the icon battles would work in this game, which really looked like they were doing some different types of genres really within this.
3392140	3401140	One of the frickin' icon that's basically summons, one of the fights in that really looked like Rez or something was like the game you were playing there.
3402140	3408140	So I'm very curious how diverse and how interesting these types of mini games are that they put in there.
3409140	3419140	So yeah, they talked also a little bit about Clive's Hideout, which was supposed to be the base camp that's in the game that showed the footage, you know, about preparing for upcoming battles.
3419140	3424140	It had a little crafting system or training. There was like a training system that was in there as well.
3424140	3431140	It's confirmed that the hunt board, you might remember that from Final Fantasy 12. It was in various other games. There's a version of it in 14 as well.
3431140	3435140	The hunt board is back and you can hunt mobs in the game as well.
3436140	3446140	They talked a little bit again about some of the combat changes and the accessories that you can equip to make combat a little bit easier if you need it.
3446140	3459140	And again, I think this was cleared up a couple weeks ago, but if you missed it, the reason why you have five items and three slots is because some of the items you have like a stronger version.
3459140	3468140	So you don't need more than three slots because like, for example, one item slows down the dodge rate so that it makes dodges a little more accessible.
3468140	3472140	The other one removes dodging altogether. So there's no need to have both equipped.
3472140	3478140	So just because that was the thing that came out when that was first announced is why can you only equip some of them? Well, that's why.
3478140	3482140	So just make it a menu instead of like an equipped. I don't know. It seems like ridiculous.
3483140	3493140	I'm OK with it. I like that they did it so that the interface actually says right there, very tiny in the corner, if you're using those types of mods or not.
3493140	3504140	So people that are like, you know, watching your stream and what have you can kind of know exactly like, you know, if you're actually using those mods or not, because those icons light up that show the various mods.
3504140	3515140	I thought that was kind of interesting. So what they didn't really get into much was more of like kind of the role play elements, which they said they were going to do in April at some point.
3515140	3528140	I didn't really get a sense a lot of that with the story and everything. Apparently, there's also supposed to be some type of end game mechanic, which is interesting because I don't usually think of an end game loop and Final Fantasy games that are not MMOs.
3528140	3535140	So I'm very curious what that's going to entail in this game. And apparently we're going to get a deep dive on that a little bit later on as well.
3535140	3537140	So bringing the weapons back.
3537140	3544140	Yeah, I mean, I guess that was an end game grind and things like Final Fantasy 7, like Emerald Weapon and stuff. But yeah, I mean,
3544140	3546140	What do you mean end game? I did that halfway through the damn game.
3546140	3552140	I was already sold on this game anyway the minute I heard that Creative Business Unit 3 was making it.
3552140	3560140	But this just definitely I was like, OK, yeah, this looks great. I cannot wait to check this game out. Absolutely, absolutely.
3560140	3562140	But Rob, they can't make it diverse.
3562140	3572140	That's a problem. I mean, it is it is absolutely a problem. And, you know, I kind of went into I think it's a sign of a bigger problem.
3572140	3580140	But the way that certainly this that issue was responded to was not done well. And I got nothing. That's all I can say on that.
3580140	3586140	They they should. Yes, they needed to answer that question a lot better. And yeah, so.
3586140	3589140	Yeah, I kind of have no interest in it because of that.
3589140	3596140	I was hoping that they might have some more diverse voice actors, but they haven't really announced who they are yet.
3596140	3604140	Some people are figuring it out based on some of the clips that we've seen, but I don't believe we've had the official announcements as of just yet.
3604140	3610140	So we'll wait on that, I guess. I could be wrong, though.
3610140	3617140	Let's see. Other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm hoping the color palette gets a bit lighter.
3617140	3621140	I'm tired of drab gray medieval settings. That's why I didn't get Stranger at Paradise.
3621140	3625140	So I don't know. I actually Stranger at Paradise.
3625140	3630140	I really like the demo. Stranger at Paradise I didn't want to pay full price for. I think it's down to 40.
3630140	3634140	I'll probably get it when it comes down a little bit cheaper, but we'll see.
3634140	3639140	So I don't know how I feel about it still.
3639140	3647140	You know, I I'll be honest, I haven't been really excited about a Final Fantasy game in a long time.
3647140	3655140	Like, not even the seven remake, 15 was completely unappealing to me because, I mean, I just saw a lot of bro dudes.
3655140	3660140	No, there was there was nothing really that appealed to me yet.
3660140	3668140	I think that the the series has lost some charm.
3668140	3671140	It really it really has to me.
3672140	3676140	I didn't love 15, but I didn't think it was the worst.
3676140	3683140	But I think I think it was kind of a mistake to pivot that the way that they did ever in the first place anyway.
3683140	3689140	But it is what it is. This game to me looks like it's going to be better than 15, which isn't a high bar.
3689140	3695140	But I have faith it's going to probably be a solid middle of the pack Final Fantasy game.
3695140	3699140	And, you know, I I always get into these games from the pixel remasters.
3699140	3703140	The old games are finally coming out on PlayStation Switch this week, actually.
3703140	3707140	So that's also very exciting. I'm excited to revisit a lot of those classics.
3707140	3714140	So I think that's all I want to say about that for now.
3714140	3718140	I'm sure we'll see more teasers for that game because that game's only two months away.
3718140	3721140	It's wild to think that we've got some big stuff coming up.
3721140	3725140	But yeah, summer's almost upon us. All right.
3725140	3732140	Moving on, Dark Sakura. So back to the Sony dramas and a U.S.
3732140	3737140	senator who is big surprise Republican.
3737140	3743140	Send a letter to Sony actually directly to the CEO Yoshida Kinichiro, quote,
3743140	3750140	regarding its anti-competitive behavior and to request information on the company's acquisition agreements.
3750140	3761140	So basically some of the quotes on here is he wanted to express concern about Sony's efforts to protect its gaming console business from competition.
3761140	3772140	And then, quote, I am concerned Sony's dominance of that market and its efforts to perpetuate its current position imperils an important economic development opportunity for North Dakota.
3772140	3777140	He's the North Dakota Republican dude.
3777140	3788140	And so the things that he's requested are for unredacted copies of all agreements that give Sony an exclusive right to distribute a third party game.
3788140	3795140	All agreements between Sony and third party publishers that prevent them from releasing their games on other systems.
3795140	3802140	All internal company documents describing the strategic rationale for Sony's decision to acquire Bungie.
3802140	3809140	All correspondence with the U.S. government or regulatory agencies relating to video game competition.
3809140	3813140	And I mean, he's just one more out of.
3813140	3828140	I mean, there were there were four other Republicans and six other Democrats that were accusing Sony of deliberately making exclusivity deals with third party publishers to make sure that Microsoft doesn't get a foothold in Japan.
3828140	3834140	I will go ahead and say that I don't think many people were very interested in Xbox anyway.
3834140	3837140	That has nothing to do with it, but whatever.
3837140	3850140	There are also letters that asked U.S. trade representative Catherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to raise the issue with Japan when they go for trade talks.
3850140	3860140	But that basically the claim is that it's putting Microsoft at a disadvantage.
3860140	3863140	So I don't know.
3863140	3866140	But that's that's one of the big ones lately.
3866140	3874140	But I mean, keep in mind that corporations work quite a bit differently there than here.
3874140	3884140	And they may have a completely legal like it may be perfectly legal there.
3884140	3888140	I mean, I don't know what.
3888140	3895140	I don't know what we can do about practices in Japan.
3895140	3904140	Yeah, no, totally. It is it is very strange, but it's also it's also so weird on the heels of how much Sony has been coming out after Microsoft.
3904140	3910140	It's so weird because it almost seems like that has been what's had the effect of suddenly now retaliation is what it is.
3910140	3922140	It is odd. But, you know, it's also, you know, last time or the last couple of weeks we brought this up that, you know, Congress was getting it was the senator from Washington who is getting campaign donations from Microsoft.
3922140	3928140	But now you're talking about comments from a senator in North Dakota, not exactly known for its tech industry.
3928140	3932140	So it's interesting that it's kind of spreading.
3932140	3935140	But yeah, I wonder what lobbies have contacted him.
3935140	3937140	Yeah, yeah, true. I'm sure.
3937140	3939140	But I follow the money.
3939140	3944140	I just. Yeah. What are they going to be able to do about things in Japan?
3944140	3953140	But I on one hand, I'm going to say that I think a lot of the ways Sony has been attacking the Microsoft merger has been bullshit.
3953140	3961140	And I think in some ways, yeah, this is a little bit retaliation for that is like, hey, not everything you're doing is pretty cute either.
3961140	3970140	So on the one hand, the only thing that kind of encourages me about this is I'm like, oh, that Activision Blizzard Microsoft merger is almost sure to go through.
3970140	3974140	And look, say what you will about that deal. I understand.
3974140	3981140	If there's no place for Bobby Kotick in the future of Microsoft after this merger, I am fully supportive of it.
3981140	3987140	That is that is priority number one, priority number one in the gaming industry right now.
3987140	3992140	Remove Bobby Kotick. That should be priority number one in the entire industry.
3992140	3998140	Going back to what Ikuma says, Ikuma JP in chat.
3998140	4004140	Now, Japan sales are low because Microsoft kills the product too soon.
4004140	4013140	It does make me think of Scalebound. You know, that was supposed to be the big, you know, one of the big titles for Microsoft that, you know, was going to be the Platinum Games was involved that.
4013140	4016140	And then it just kind of was quietly killed in the middle of the night.
4016140	4023140	Yeah, well, and the other thing, too, like I said, you know, like, for example, we have a business.
4023140	4032140	Well, one of the business laws is that a company like stays more specialized within its its department.
4032140	4039140	Like, for example, when we think Mitsubishi over here, what do we think of?
4039140	4041140	The car.
4041140	4044140	Yeah, but they also make aluminum siding and pencils.
4044140	4046140	OK, I get you.
4046140	4056140	So over here, well, actually, I think in general now is that like a lot of their art supplies are under a different name, but it's all going back to the same place.
4056140	4063140	It's just, you know, the legalities are are just they're they're different.
4063140	4068140	Ikuma JP kind of continuing that analogy, saying like, if Google made a new app, would you use it?
4068140	4071140	You know, it'll die as soon as you get used to it.
4071140	4084140	Kind of like I guess Microsoft has a similar reputation over there, that Google is really cementing for itself here after what happened with Stadia, quite honestly, among a variety of other Google products over the years.
4084140	4086140	Well, I have to for this.
4086140	4087140	So no, I know.
4087140	4094140	And honestly, though, I'm kind of glad because I like GeForce better.
4094140	4101140	All right. Well, sadly, one game you won't be playing on GeForce is our next topic because it's going to be ending.
4101140	4103140	Right, Logie? Not GeForce, but this game.
4103140	4104140	Yes.
4104140	4113140	So unfortunately, the kind of really awesome media molecule sandbox game Dreams is coming to an end.
4113140	4129140	So it came out four years ago on the PlayStation four, and they're going to be ending live support for Dreams on September 1st because the team is moving on to an exciting new project.
4129140	4132140	Well, at least that's good.
4132140	4138140	So with that says, we know this won't be an easy message for everyone here and certainly not been an easy decision.
4138140	4155140	Dreams has been a special project for Media Molecule and helping this community of game developers, tinkerers, creatives and collaborators and dreamers grow and express themselves remains one of the best things we've ever done.
4155140	4169140	Thank you for being a part of it with us, and we look forward and join us in our next adventure and basically said that there was not a sustainable path for Dreams, and they had to make the decision to change the product strategy.
4169140	4186140	I think you could still play the game offline, though, but yeah, right now it's they're going to be dropping the storage limit, I guess, online to five gigabytes and one gigabyte locally.
4187140	4199140	Hmm, I know this game definitely had like its fan base of people and you know, the types of things that they were making it this is very rich, robust type of you know, development system, especially for console.
4199140	4213140	So I mean, seeing it and like, you know, obviously a lot of these online games and eventually, but I guess maybe it's a little bit surprising because I still feel like many people were discovering this through the PlayStation five and that sort of thing.
4213140	4215140	So I'm just I'm a little bit.
4216140	4222140	It seems early, I don't know, but maybe the game didn't get as big as they hope, but I think I think they launched it weird.
4222140	4225140	I don't think they ever marketed it appropriately.
4225140	4227140	Mark, it was such a niche thing.
4227140	4235140	Like, I think there was a lot of sloppy things on the discovery front that they could have done a lot better, quite honestly.
4235140	4237140	I mean, there's a lot that they've done.
4237140	4242140	Like, I think like people were even like taking like little big planet and doing crazy things with that as well.
4242140	4251140	So like, yeah, I think that they probably need the market to better at least like maybe showcase some of the things that people are making that were really cool.
4251140	4255140	I'm sure some of it is like, you know, kind of skirting copyright a bit.
4255140	4262140	But, you know, it still would have been interesting to see, you know, something like, hey, look at this cool game that someone made.
4262140	4267140	Like it's a first person shooter or hey, this is a racing game. It's amazing looking, you know, some of that stuff.
4267140	4270140	But it's pretty quiet. I mean.
4272140	4282140	I think I feel like they were relying on the social media and the media to highlight a lot of those things for them when a lot of those, you know, unique things would come out.
4282140	4291140	But you're right, that stuff that would gain that type of traction was almost always skirting the copyright line or just blatantly passing it.
4291140	4298140	Yeah. So there were some like really cool things that were just like, you know, recreations of like some of the stuff that you could do.
4298140	4304140	Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Yeah. It's. It's unfortunate, I guess.
4304140	4310140	Yeah. I guess it also feels like a bummer because there's not really a successor in this arena because, you know, we know of yet.
4310140	4320140	Yeah, there could be something in the future. Who knows? But, you know, the last little big planet game they made was that Sackboy Big Adventure, which, by the way, just went on PlayStation Plus.
4320140	4331140	So if you haven't checked it out yet and you have that, it's worth looking at. I played a little bit of it, but it's not LittleBigPlanet like with the creator mode in it, though.
4331140	4340140	But it's, you know, it's kind of like imagining what might LittleBigPlanet look like in 3D, but there's no creation mode. It's just here's what the single player campaign might look like.
4340140	4341140	Yeah.
4341140	4355140	Yeah. So that's interesting. All right. Well, talking about games that just came out this last week, this one, I wish I had enough time to play everything because I'd like to check this game out.
4355140	4364140	And that's Tron Identity. Tron Identity came out on the Switch this past week on April 11th. The developer of the game was Biffle Games.
4364140	4376140	That is the only game that we know that they're working on for now. But there was an internal Disney interview. This was from D23. That's why they call it an internal Disney interview.
4376140	4384140	They talked to Tron Identity producer Heidi Vargas. Now, there's no specifics, but there is this very interesting quote.
4384140	4396140	Tron Identity is the start of Biffle Games collaboration with Disney on Tron dedicated games. Players can expect more Tron titles to come in the future. So perhaps...
4396140	4397140	There's another movie.
4397140	4404140	Well, I wish they would. That movie's been stop and go for forever. Yeah.
4404140	4417140	I know. But well, but now, you know, at least to Disney's credit, at least they finally opened that ride. Had a, I think had a soft opening at Disney World because I know I've had friends that have been on it.
4417140	4425140	So it's it's so because Tron's in the parks now, they do have an interest because that means merchandising, merchandising, right?
4425140	4434140	So they have an interest in bringing Tron back up to the front and trying to get some of that sweet merchandise that goes with the gift shop as you exit the ride. Right.
4434140	4449140	Which, heaven help me the day I walk in there. Heaven help my ass the day I ride that ride and walk into the gift shop when I disembark the ride. Like, yikes.
4450140	4457140	And you you both are screwed, too, and you know it. That's why that's that's why we've got to stay the hell out of Florida for a multitude of reasons.
4457140	4459140	But that that is. Yeah.
4459140	4466140	Bought Tron merch at Disneyland this last year, so. Yeah.
4466140	4471140	Looney Bard says your ass will thank you since your wallet will take over.
4471140	4476140	And I guess it's all in the card now as to what Matt says. Yeah, I want that Tron merch.
4476140	4483140	Yep. Bobby Blackwell said the official open to the ride was April 4th. So there it is. The ride is officially official now. So.
4483140	4488140	I think I have a pin trading pin from Shanghai for the Tron ride.
4488140	4491140	Oh, nice. Nice. Someone sent me.
4491140	4499140	All right. Well, let's go to Dark Soccer for our next story. A very different type of note, but an interesting little aside.
4499140	4509140	Just, you know, I love little like people stories, I guess. And so there's an online jigsaw site called I'm a Puzzle.
4509140	4516140	They analyzed gaming related search terms to find the state that had the most interest in video games.
4516140	4527140	And apparently it was Nevada that took the top spot at seven thousand six hundred and fifty eight average monthly gaming related searches per one hundred thousand population.
4527140	4536140	So the most search terms in the state were PS5, Steam and Nintendo Switch. Right before them were Georgia and New York.
4536140	4541140	The least interested was Hawaii.
4541140	4547140	I guess when the weather's beautiful, it's in Hawaii all the time.
4547140	4554140	Of course, this was the same one that I showed you the story man arrested after gun found in quesadilla.
4554140	4557140	And I'm like, are you trying to show up, Florida?
4557140	4562140	Yeah. And I believe my response was what I what is Chipotle putting in their stuff now?
4562140	4566140	I know they put a variety of strange things in there sometimes, but my gosh.
4566140	4568140	But at any rate.
4568140	4571140	Yeah, I can imagine.
4571140	4580140	There's a lot of very remote parts of Nevada, so not to say it's the only state that has a lot of remote parts, because most of the people live, you know, obviously does Las Vegas.
4580140	4586140	Yeah, sure. Any state, I guess, does Las Vegas, Henderson or Reno, Truckee, Carson City.
4586140	4591140	Those are kind of like your big populated areas in Nevada, but the rest that's a big state.
4591140	4598140	So I can see why people because it gets it gets very hot in Nevada and the weather's not nearly what Hawaii gets for weather.
4598140	4602140	So I can see why people stay inside and play video games, for sure. But it is it is interesting.
4602140	4608140	I would have thought California are one of the more, you know, tech embracing states.
4608140	4618140	Hawaii has also been having a big problem with unemployment. I'm just going to throw that out there with just some of the changes going on.
4618140	4622140	I was actually watching a documentary about it not long ago.
4622140	4632140	So but it's also a mostly a lot of the commerce is from the tourist industry.
4632140	4634140	Sure.
4634140	4645140	So, I mean, yeah, people want to play games, but that's not, I think, the source of attention for for, you know, the majority, at least of the more highly populated areas.
4645140	4649140	Well, and then the effect that pandemic lockdowns had on all that tourism, you know.
4649140	4650140	They had it bad.
4650140	4661140	Yeah, of course. Yeah. So I remember Hawaii kind of had to come up with their own sort of system to try to get people to come back like, you know, the tourist rules there and they were doing what they could do.
4661140	4665140	So it's yeah, but.
4665140	4673140	All right. But I mean, when you're when you're an island, you're going to have a harder time managing, you know, treading water like that.
4673140	4675140	Yeah, for sure.
4675140	4677140	All right. Well, let's move on.
4677140	4679140	Logie.
4679140	4682140	All right. So this is interesting.
4682140	4689140	We talked about a little bit how Nintendo is cracking down on people using their IP for things.
4689140	4702140	Well, now it's kind of the reverse. So we have Bethesda and all the scrolls online, kind of stealing someone's fan art and using it in game.
4702140	4708140	So there was a there was a character skin called Mercy Mother's Body Art.
4708140	4728140	And if you look at the skin, you can see that the face and the head have basically the artwork from this guy, Dave, who had his basically artwork stolen from I don't remember which site it was on, but DeviantArt maybe or something like that.
4728140	4734140	And oh, no, it was on his Tumblr. OK, so he had that appear in game.
4734140	4747140	And then, of course, you know, the old scrolls online or Bethesda came out on their Twitter accounts that we are aware of the situation with the ESO fan art or fan artists.
4747140	4751140	It was never our intention to include any community fan art without proper credit.
4751140	4756140	We were in contact with the artists and we'll work with them to make sure that there is a proper resolution.
4756140	4761140	So funny how like, you know, that they decide that they're oh, we're going to work it out, we're going to work it out.
4761140	4767140	But when it when it comes to like, like, say, if I'm making something with Bethesda's IP, oh, they're going to send the lawyers.
4767140	4775140	So, so interesting that they're willing to settle it with the fans, you know, amicably if it's their bad.
4775140	4778140	But like, if it's anybody else, let's just send the lawyers after them.
4778140	4781140	So weird how that works in the corporate world.
4782140	4787140	And then some places just like, OK, we'll just pay you off and that's it.
4787140	4798140	And it sucks because there's no one out there to really represent the little creators out there, for lack of a better term, when we know that, you know, all of these big video game companies tend to be extremely litigious.
4798140	4806140	You know, it does really suck about our legal system is that who's advocating for the little guy in these situations?
4806140	4813140	And there are companies out there who just make their habit of it, like, for example, Dolls Kill.
4813140	4819140	They have stolen artwork, they've stolen products from independent makers.
4819140	4823140	That's why I don't give them any fucking money.
4823140	4833140	There also is, you know, like I like I don't know if I ever told you about my my friend in Australia.
4833140	4845140	We were both Homestuck fans and I was wandering around in this Russian grocery store out in Citrus Heights by the Eco Thrift.
4845140	4856140	And I happened to see Homestuck artwork, clearly fan art, on the front page of a Russian publication.
4856140	4864140	So I took it and image searched and I found her and I said, I found your artwork being used by this company.
4864140	4870140	She's like, yeah, someone else has told me, but I sent her the book so she could have it.
4870140	4873140	And we've been friends ever since.
4873140	4877140	Yeah, but but at any rate, she's got a cute kiddo.
4877140	4883140	But at any rate, though, it's just it's not isolated to the video game industry.
4883140	4885140	The movie industry does it all the time.
4885140	4896140	Clothing companies do it all the time and they have the the legal guns to be able to defend themselves or even try to turn it around.
4896140	4904140	You know, say, oh, well, this is artwork of our property, of our intellectual property.
4904140	4912140	So. It's it's just disrespectful, but they do it for money.
4912140	4921140	That's it. Money is is they don't they don't care what they have to do, if it's the least amount of work for the most amount of profit.
4921140	4925140	SSJ100 Matt reminding us of a classic story in the same vein here.
4925140	4932140	Remember when they made Okami for Wii, they used an IGN screenshot from their site for the box art.
4932140	4940140	Granted, this isn't the same, but it's it's a funny case of big company being lazy and grabbing an image from somewhere because they're lazy.
4940140	4942140	So too much right click, save power.
4942140	4954140	Yeah, I think it's person needed artwork in a hurry for ad, you know, and given deadline and no oversight.
4954140	4968140	This is why you have someone with your company who will check your art sources and make sure everything is cool before it goes out, just for purposes like that.
4968140	4972140	Mm hmm. You know. It's ridiculous.
4972140	4978140	All right. Well, this next story is firmly in the rumor department, but there's reasons for it.
4978140	4986140	Usually we're talking about rumors, not because my uncle who works at such and such company said so, but because there are certain stars aligning in a certain way.
4986140	4991140	And this has to do with the potential new Contra game from way forward.
4991140	5000140	And this is interesting because it's just I feel like there's been just a lot of buzz with Konami like these last few months just between their Silent Hill Direct.
5000140	5002140	What we know is happening. We see CODEN.
5002140	5007140	We had the story last week about they've reopened of sorts in office.
5007140	5011140	So they seem to be definitely planting a foot forward back into game development.
5011140	5019140	So couple that with LinkedIn, which is also always a very interesting source of these sorts of things.
5019140	5031140	A way forward employee on LinkedIn had a profile that said they developed gameplay, meta design, narrative and characters for a historic shooter property.
5031140	5035140	So that says that they're working on a game that belongs to it.
5035140	5037140	I mean, that could still be a lot of things.
5037140	5050140	But the description of the game says it's an unannounced triple A shooter of an existing franchise with four distinct gameplay styles, including run and gun, top down shooter, shmup and rail gun.
5050140	5057140	Which again, are all things that Konami and Contra have delved in at some point.
5057140	5064140	So this does seem to indicate, you know, and again, WayForward actually did Contra 4 back in 2007 for the Nintendo DS.
5064140	5069140	This wouldn't be the first time WayForward has worked with Konami if this is true.
5069140	5076140	But the fact that here we are now, God, what 15 years later and potentially something new is coming out of it.
5076140	5082140	That's that's pretty interesting, but certainly probably going to be better received than Contra hardcore.
5082140	5087140	Sorry, Dark Tetsuya, I know you were a fan of that game, but most of the Internet was not on that one.
5087140	5090140	So we'll see.
5090140	5094140	But WayForward usually does some pretty solid stuff and Contra 4 was was good.
5094140	5100140	So, yeah, I'd be I'd be very curious to see what they come up with if this is true.
5100140	5103140	So. All right.
5103140	5109140	Well, I know we've talked a little bit about Contra, one classic franchise.
5109140	5117140	But here on the show every week, we like to celebrate all sorts of classic franchises or games in a segment we call Classic Game of the Week.
5117140	5130140	And so I should turn it over to the Segway.
5130140	5138140	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5138140	5142140	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5142140	5146140	All right, Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the game tonight?
5146140	5167140	The game I chose is Galaxy Fraulein Yuna, or as it's known, Genga Ojosama Densetsu Yuna, which I've actually done a game in the series before, sort of in the series that had been included partly in the series anyway.
5167140	5170140	Because I did Sapphire before, remember?
5170140	5192140	But Galaxy Fraulein Yuna originated in 1992 when Red Company, the creators, in association with Hudson Soft, reached out to Akitaka Mika to create a video game for the PC Engine Super CD.
5192140	5212140	As an established artist and a mechanical designer, also working on the Mobile Suit Gundam anime titles, including Zeta Gundam, War in the Pocket, and Stardust Memory, they were chosen to be a part of it.
5212140	5223140	And so Hudson Soft released Galaxy Fraulein Yuna in Japan in 1992 with Akitaka Mika as the character designer and writer.
5223140	5240140	So the origins of Yuna are in Akitaka's MS Girls artwork, which features in many anime-related magazines during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with MS starting for Mobile Suit.
5240140	5244140	And it was pretty girls dressed in Gundam-style armor.
5244140	5251140	And Yuna was an evolution from that artwork.
5251140	5268140	In fact, some of the characters in the worldwide merchandise division, 2001, of Le MS Girls, they bore huge resemblance to characters from the Yuna universe.
5268140	5275140	And at Anime Expo 1998, I think I went to that one.
5275140	5290140	Akitaka explained that Yuna began when the producer at the Red Company had him design a shoot-up game featuring a character based on his Gundam F91 girl, and it ended up becoming a visual novel instead.
5291140	5302140	But that concept of the shooter is what became Gengafuke Densetsu Sapphire, which I've done before. I love Sapphire.
5302140	5312140	At any rate, the series became very popular very quickly and has led to so many different spin-offs.
5312140	5323140	So we're going to go a little bit more into what the origin of the character in her universe is like.
5323140	5338140	So it stars a girl named Kagurazaka Yuna, who kind of has that whole Usagi trope about her, except she's a bit smarter and more coordinated.
5338140	5355140	But she is the winner of an interstellar beauty contest, and she's a teen celebrity, an idol singer, even before she gets to be the savior of light, who is a magical girl that has to save the entire universe from the forces of darkness. No pressure.
5355140	5358140	She's a model and an actress.
5359140	5378140	Exactly. But there's a lot. There's a lot. And it was funny, I actually was getting some information off the TV Tropes website, and there's a lot of tropes that get touched.
5378140	5393140	Anywho, going back. So the games that existed, we start off with the original Galaxy Fraulein Yuna for PC Engine Super CD-ROM 2 in 1982.
5393140	5404140	And it was the first Yuna work officially released to the public. And then there was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna 2 Eternal Princess for PC Engine Super CD-ROM in 1985.
5405140	5418140	There was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna FX for the PC-FX in 1996. There was Yuna Remix for Sega Saturn in 1996, which was an updated re-release of the original 1992 game.
5418140	5432140	It had improved graphics and new animated cutscenes, and the game was released in both a normal and collector's edition that had many omake items.
5432140	5440140	You know, omake is like bonus, like how my Cardcaptor Sakura set came with all that shit.
5440140	5441140	Oh yes.
5442140	5449140	There was also Galaxy Fraulein Yuna 3 Lightning Angel for Sega Saturn in 1997.
5449140	5459140	Galaxy Fraulein Yuna 3 Final Edition for PlayStation in 1998, which is a port of Lightning Angel with enhanced graphics and bonus content.
5459140	5465140	There was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Collection for PSP, PlayStation Portable, in 2008.
5465140	5471140	It had an unenhanced port of the first two games, along with Sapphire on one disk.
5471140	5477140	And it had an image gallery, but there were no enhancements from the PC Engine versions.
5477140	5489140	There were also two Sega Saturn disks called Mika Akitaka Illustrated Works Volumes 1 and 2, released in 1986 and 1997 respectively.
5489140	5498140	And these were software that weren't true games, but collections of artwork, music, and digital omake.
5498140	5516140	Also in 1997, there were two computer software packages, the Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Hybrid Collection and the Visual Soundtrack, with the former being PC-related omake like desktop wallpaper, cursors, screensavers.
5516140	5520140	I have a Street Fighter Alpha 2 one like that for the record.
5520140	5525140	And then the latter is music clips with like a slideshow video.
5525140	5538140	And then while most of the games are of a visual novel, there are combat scenes that are sort of turn-based role-playing game style.
5538140	5547140	And Yuna 3 incorporates like a 3D isometric tactical view that puts the combat like a tactical RPG.
5547140	5552140	And also Yuna is a secret unlockable character in Saturn Bomberman.
5556140	5559140	So, there's more!
5559140	5565140	Because remember, we had, was it Tetsuya that said this was a game?
5565140	5567140	Yes, this was a game.
5567140	5570140	There were also two Yuna anime series.
5570140	5580140	So the first was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Siren Sadness, which is a two-part OAV, translated and released in the West as Galaxy Fraulein Yuna.
5581140	5589140	It follows the plot of the Yuna FX video game, and the opening sequence is identical except for the title card.
5589140	5592140	And it's portrayed as a comedy.
5594140	5599140	The second was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna The Abyssal Fairy, which is a three-episode OAV.
5599140	5605140	And it was released as Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Returns or Dawn of Dark Sisters.
5606140	5616140	It doesn't duplicate any video game content, but chronologically it takes place before the first, after the first OAV, but before Yuna 3.
5616140	5618140	And it's a darker story.
5618140	5620140	But it's mostly action drama.
5620140	5622140	And then there were the CD and music releases.
5622140	5624140	So much music.
5625140	5633140	And there's even a radio show that ended up getting released as three separate CDs.
5633140	5635140	Of course, drama CDs and everything.
5635140	5638140	And a whole cast of characters.
5638140	5647140	But it's that ultimate 90s style with the huge ass hair and the eyes the size of manhole covers.
5647140	5650140	So there you go.
5651140	5655140	Rama in chat is mentioning that he bought that anime when he came out to visit.
5655140	5658140	I was there, I do believe.
5658140	5667140	But I have like a couple of laser discs, I think, that I've acquired just from five dollar laser disc bins.
5667140	5676140	So, but I do have Sapphire, which, you know, was inspired by the original request for the game.
5676140	5680140	And I actually think I have the Galaxy Fraulein collection for PSP.
5680140	5687140	Not that I've actually played the games, but I knew of the games before I knew of the anime.
5687140	5690140	Funny how that works sometimes.
5690140	5694140	I've been into PC Engine games for a while.
5694140	5696140	There it is, the classic game of the week.
5696140	5699140	Darsakha, you're going to have to read that name one more time because I will butcher it.
5699140	5702140	Galaxy Fraulein Yuna.
5702140	5704140	It's German.
5704140	5708140	Oh, I thought I had a whole subtitle to it as well, okay.
5708140	5712140	Well, I mean, there was the, hold on, I'll get to it.
5712140	5716140	It was, I just had it a second ago.
5716140	5725140	Oh yeah, it was, it was like Genga Densetsu Fraulein Yuna, something like that.
5725140	5732140	I mean, it's like, what is it, Galaxy Legend Fraulein Yuna.
5733140	5744140	But yeah, anyway, but yeah, it's, it's definitely a big staple, I would say.
5744140	5747140	All right, thanks for sharing it with us.
5747140	5751140	Because I have to admit, not one I'm super familiar with or know much about.
5751140	5754140	But that's, I like to learn things here on OLR, don't we all?
5754140	5759140	I haven't gone obscure in a while, so at least as far as obscure in North America.
5759140	5761140	Yeah, yeah, for sure.
5761140	5765140	All right, well, before we get into some rapid fire news, I just want to point out,
5765140	5772140	so earlier we were talking about like the Tron ride and all that stuff and the merchandising.
5772140	5773140	Merchandising.
5773140	5774140	Yes, exactly.
5774140	5778140	So there was a link to Disney Food Blog, I guess.
5778140	5779140	I don't think this is official.
5779140	5781140	I think this is some fan thing.
5781140	5783140	But SJ100Matt actually sent this to us.
5783140	5786140	I'm actually looking at some of the merchandise that's available.
5786140	5791140	And the very first thing I saw, the light up jacket with the shoulder cutouts, which
5791140	5794140	is very interesting, kind of that style.
5794140	5796140	The Coro one.
5796140	5798140	Yeah, 100 bucks for that, but it lights up.
5798140	5799140	That's why.
5799140	5804140	You can also get one that's all together like a normal type of hoodie for $100 as well,
5804140	5806140	because the light up stuff is cool.
5806140	5810140	Now they sell these Tron identity discs with a Bluetooth speaker in them.
5810140	5812140	I remember the one I got in Electronica.
5812140	5813140	They had those at Disneyland.
5813140	5814140	They just made the-
5814140	5815140	They're selling them.
5815140	5816140	Oh, really?
5816140	5817140	Okay.
5817140	5818140	Oh, that's good.
5818140	5820140	Yeah, they're when you get off of...
5820140	5824140	Actually, they're at the Star Trader.
5824140	5828140	I was going to say, I bet a lot of these do make their way over to Disneyland as well.
5828140	5834140	If nothing else, that gigantic World of Disney store usually almost has everything.
5834140	5838140	But yeah, they have some other various shirts, a little remote control light cycle, which
5838140	5839140	I thought was funny.
5839140	5841140	Otherwise, some shirts and things.
5841140	5842140	I like the water bottle.
5842140	5843140	I'll probably get the light up jacket.
5843140	5848140	I mean, I did pay 75 bucks to get a Hawkeye jacket.
5848140	5853140	This also interacted with the ride somehow, I think.
5853140	5854140	Oh, probably.
5854140	5857140	Yeah, because they just say they're Tron identity chips.
5857140	5858140	Yeah.
5858140	5860140	But the water bottles light up too.
5860140	5864140	That cracked me up.
5864140	5866140	And then you can even get little picture frames that say Tron.
5866140	5867140	All right.
5867140	5871140	Anyway, I'm going to stop giving Disney free advertising, but I'm sorry.
5871140	5876140	Tron just strikes a particular nerd nerve with me as I think that is true for all of
5876140	5877140	us.
5877140	5880140	You say Tron and we all go, huh?
5880140	5882140	So it's just, here's what it is.
5882140	5886140	You know what I found the other day organizing, Rob?
5886140	5888140	My Kubrick Tron figures.
5888140	5889140	Oh, cool.
5889140	5892140	Yeah, the four pack.
5892140	5895140	And then I got a shirt at...
5896140	5897140	Crap.
5897140	5901140	What was that store at downtown Disney called that had the expensive Disney shit?
5901140	5902140	Oh God.
5902140	5903140	Yeah.
5903140	5906140	I can't remember, but I know what you're talking about.
5906140	5907140	Yeah.
5907140	5911140	But I have a Tron shirt from there with a yellow light cycle.
5911140	5914140	And actually it was Chris that bought it for me.
5914140	5916140	Oh, some comments in chat.
5916140	5919140	Bobby Blackwell is pointing out, we didn't talk about the action figure that you put
5919140	5920140	your face on.
5920140	5921140	That came up in a previous episode.
5921140	5924140	I know we talked about it already, but yes, that's another thing.
5924140	5925140	I need this in my life.
5925140	5926140	Yeah.
5926140	5927140	Taking the lightsaber thing a step further.
5927140	5929140	You can actually build your own Tron action figure that's yourself.
5929140	5931140	There you go, Dark Sakura.
5931140	5932140	You can put yourself in Tron.
5932140	5935140	And it comes in an arcade cabinet.
5935140	5938140	See, I cannot go to Disney World.
5938140	5940140	I will be broke.
5940140	5942140	It's a problem.
5942140	5944140	All right.
5944140	5947140	Let's travel around the industry real fast and check out some rapid fire news and some
5947140	5951140	other things that are going on that are worth our attention.
5951140	5953140	Loki, we'll go to you.
5953140	5960140	Yes, I'm always excited to talk about the power washing simulator universe.
5960140	5961140	Hell yeah.
5961140	5968140	And we got some roadmaps for 2023 coming to us from Future Lab, the developers of the
5968140	5969140	game.
5969140	5972140	So, of course, they're talking about some of the things that are coming soon.
5972140	5976140	And then, of course, all throughout the end of the year, starting off, they're going to
5976140	5982140	be adding a brand new 1.2 patch, which adds additional jobs and updates some of the older
5982140	5983140	ones.
5983140	5989140	They're going to be doing some – and that's coming actually in two days, so April 18th.
5989140	5995140	And then they're going to do a seasonal free content – they're going to have paid DLC
5995140	6000140	and seasonal free content that's throughout the year, as well as exciting news in quarter
6000140	6001140	three as well.
6001140	6002140	Sequel?
6002140	6003140	Sequel, maybe?
6003140	6006140	So, that'll be coming later on.
6006140	6010140	But yeah, the free content is cool.
6010140	6017140	I will definitely pick up the paid content, too, because I really like that game.
6017140	6022460	Along with that, of course, there's going to be – Tekken 8 is expected to support
6022460	6029640	cross-play for the first time, so you'll be able to mix PlayStation, PC, and Xbox all
6029640	6030640	together.
6030640	6032640	That's pretty cool.
6032640	6034640	Pretty exciting.
6034640	6035640	Awesome.
6035640	6036640	DarkSaga?
6037640	6040640	So, surprising nobody.
6040640	6047640	The Mario movie has surpassed $500 million globally, and it is officially the biggest
6047640	6049640	video game adaptation.
6049640	6051640	Well, mostly.
6051640	6060640	It actually surpassed the other highest grossing film of 2023 so far, which was Ant-Man and
6061140	6063140	the loss of Quantumania.
6063140	6075140	So, it is actually way ahead of other movies that were – well, first of all, I don't
6075140	6088140	know how Warcraft made what it did, but it exceeded Warcraft, which made $439,048,914,
6088140	6090640	which actually made more than Detective Pikachu as well.
6090640	6093640	If these are global figures, Warcraft did very well in China.
6093640	6094640	Gotcha.
6094640	6098640	But at any rate, yeah, it's the big one.
6098640	6100140	They've leveled up.
6100140	6101640	New high score.
6101640	6103640	Do, do, do, do, do, do.
6103640	6107640	That sound was made at the box office this week, pretty much.
6107640	6108640	Yeah, basically.
6108640	6109640	I still need to see it.
6109640	6111640	At Nintendo, you got Ching.
6111640	6112640	I still need to see it.
6112640	6114640	I'm hoping I'll get there this week.
6115140	6119140	So, I didn't even talk – I got so sidetracked with the Creative Showcase, which I don't
6119140	6120140	regret.
6120140	6121140	It was a great time.
6121140	6123140	I didn't even talk about other games I played this week.
6123140	6129140	I've been playing Pokemon Legends on stream, and this is big for me, DarkSakura.
6129140	6132140	I know you've done this with a few games.
6132140	6138140	I'm about to beat Pokemon Legends on stream, and I would say most of my gameplay has been
6138140	6139140	streamed.
6139140	6142140	I've been side questing off stream, but my main questing I've been doing on stream.
6142140	6146640	I believe – it's been a while, but I believe this is the first game I've played to completion
6146640	6152640	on stream, and I'm gonna roll credits on the game probably tomorrow after work, and
6152640	6160140	then maybe do some post-game stuff, because the thing with Pokemon is that you roll the
6160140	6162140	credits, but have you really cleared the game?
6162140	6165640	There's still more to do, but I say if you get the credits, you beat the game.
6165640	6168140	That's kind of my criteria there.
6168140	6173140	So I'm probably rolling credits on Monday's stream, and then we'll have a little time
6173140	6177140	to do some post-game stuff, and then the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters come out on PlayStation.
6177140	6181640	That'll kind of be the next thing up in queue for me, but that's kind of a big deal
6181640	6186640	for me is actually getting to do that, so I just wanted to throw that out there.
6186640	6195640	The cool thing about RPGs is that you have the official – you have an actual end point
6195640	6196640	on it, you know?
6196640	6197640	Yeah.
6198140	6205640	And something – I mean, I love it when I get to the end of the RPGs that I do, and
6205640	6209140	it's a feeling of accomplishment, and then people get excited when they're there to
6209140	6210640	see it, so congratulations.
6210640	6212140	Thank you.
6212140	6217640	Well, and I realize Twitch has that memories feature that's really underused, but when
6217640	6221640	I roll the credits, if you're there in chat, you will get the memories badge or whatever
6221640	6226140	it is, because I will hit the – I was too slow to do it when I got the shiny shanks,
6226140	6230140	because I realized it like two minutes after, but now I've got that locked and loaded
6230140	6236640	as a button for when I do those important things, so I'll remember that in the future.
6236640	6240140	The reason why I brought that up, though, was that I've been so busy playing that
6240140	6243640	game and doing that after work is that I haven't really had the time to go out to a movie,
6243640	6247640	and I was pretty busy this weekend, so – but I'm going to try to get out during the
6247640	6250640	week at some point and see the Mario movie, because I do – you know, it's been out
6250640	6251640	a couple weeks now.
6251640	6252640	I do want to see it, so.
6252640	6253640	Rob.
6253640	6254640	What?
6254640	6256140	Take me for my birthday.
6256140	6258140	Uh, you're doing something on your birthday.
6258140	6260140	What days are you free this week?
6260140	6263140	My week is my birthday, duh.
6263140	6265140	What days are you free?
6265140	6271140	I will be free Thursday afternoon, because my subathon's gonna – if I make it the
6271140	6273640	full 24 hours, I end at 10 a.m.
6273640	6276140	Wait, I thought your subathon was on Thursday.
6276140	6280140	No, it's on Wednesday, my birthday.
6280140	6284140	Oh my god, okay, my calendar – oh my god, it is.
6284640	6288640	I thought for some reason the 19th was Thursday.
6288640	6289640	No.
6289640	6291640	Ah, that's funny.
6291640	6293640	Okay, so maybe Thursday then.
6293640	6294640	Alright.
6294640	6295640	Yeah, let's do it.
6295640	6298640	No, I'm not saying take me to see it.
6298640	6299640	I would go see it.
6299640	6302640	I mean, I can buy a movie ticket.
6302640	6304640	It's not a big deal, but yeah.
6304640	6306640	Oh, for me.
6306640	6308640	Oh, you shouldn't have.
6308640	6310640	Okay, on second thought, alright.
6310640	6311640	Hey!
6311640	6313640	No take back.
6314140	6315140	Alright.
6315140	6323140	Anyway, so now that we know what day 419 actually is, this begs the question, what are you doing
6323140	6324140	on 420?
6324140	6330140	It sounds like we might be going to see a movie, but something else you can do on 420
6330140	6333140	is actually watch the Street Fighter VI showcase.
6333140	6337140	That's right, just like we had the footage from Final Fantasy XVI this week, we get 30
6337140	6342640	minutes of Street Fighter VI coming from Capcom on 420.
6342640	6344640	What a nice day to do that.
6344640	6349140	So, you can watch that starting at 3 o'clock Pacific, 6 o'clock Eastern over at Capcom's
6349140	6354640	YouTube channel, and apparently Lil Wayne is going to be hosting the show, so that's
6354640	6355640	fun.
6355640	6356640	So, yeah.
6356640	6360640	But he's done stuff with Street Fighter before, so clearly he's a fan.
6360640	6362640	It was fun when I played it.
6362640	6364640	I had a really great time playing that game.
6364640	6367140	Yeah, we love even-numbered Street Fighter games.
6367140	6373140	There will be details on the world tour, the battle hub, fighting ground, also some big
6373140	6375140	news at the end of the show.
6375140	6377140	Could Lil Wayne be joining the roster?
6377140	6378140	Oh, boy.
6378140	6382640	No, I don't think that'll be happening, but it'd be funny if it did, though.
6382640	6385140	Lil Jon will be joining the roster.
6385140	6386140	Yeah!
6386140	6393140	I can't do the impression like, what was her name on Snatch Game on Deja Sky did Lil Jon
6393140	6395640	and won with that whole thing.
6395640	6401640	But anyway, I'm sure they'll be announcing, yeah, now they're saying DLC in chat.
6401640	6403640	Mike Deff says Lil Wayne DLC.
6403640	6404640	We'll see.
6404640	6405640	All right.
6405640	6408640	Let's travel, oh, no, that was it.
6408640	6411640	So, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things that
6411640	6414640	we could be playing this week on 4.20 or otherwise.
6414640	6416640	We'll start with you, Loki.
6416640	6418640	What's coming out in the US?
6419140	6424140	We have a game called God of Rock on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
6424140	6426140	One, and Xbox Series.
6426140	6432140	We have The Mage Seeker, a League of Legends story on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation
6432140	6436140	4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6436140	6439140	Minecraft Legends comes out this week.
6439140	6444140	PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6444140	6448140	I'll probably pick that up on Game Pass because I ain't buying that shit.
6448640	6452640	Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
6452640	6458640	Akiba's Trip 2, Director's Cut on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.
6458640	6463640	Arcana of Paradise, The Tower on PC and Nintendo Switch.
6463640	6469640	DNF Duel for Nintendo Switch, unfortunately not a sequel to Duke Nukem Forever.
6470140	6477140	For Nintendo Switch, Stray Blade on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6477140	6480140	Oh, we have this coming out this week.
6480140	6483140	Wow, two surprises to me.
6483140	6489140	Advance Wars 1 and 2 reboot camp for Nintendo Switch after its year delay.
6489140	6493140	And it's finally happening.
6493140	6495140	It's finally happening.
6495140	6500640	Island 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6500640	6501640	That's it.
6501640	6502640	Oh, heck.
6502640	6505640	For as long as that game has kind of been in development, I'm kind of surprised.
6505640	6509640	It seems to be just kind of like, and there it is this week.
6509640	6514640	I hope they have some more marketing behind that to push that.
6514640	6515640	So we'll see.
6515640	6519640	I feel like I've seen very little about that game, all things considered.
6519640	6520640	But we'll see.
6520640	6524640	No severed torso special edition this time, I guess.
6525140	6526140	I guess not.
6526140	6529140	There are no torsos.
6529140	6532140	Going to Japan this week, check out some of the releases there.
6532140	6537140	You have some overlap here in the US because Minecraft Legends also gets a Japanese release
6537140	6540140	on the Nintendo Switch on April 19th.
6540140	6545140	Also on the Switch this week, Coffee Talk Episode 2, Hibiscus and Butterfly.
6545140	6549140	Not to be confused with the classic Saturday Night Live sketch.
6549140	6551140	I'll give you a topic.
6551640	6553640	Coffee Talk is neither about coffee nor talk.
6553640	6555640	Discuss.
6555640	6556640	Welcome to Coffee Talk.
6556640	6559640	I'm Linda Richman.
6559640	6560640	I love that.
6560640	6563640	That was the era of Saturday Night Live, but it has nothing to do with that.
6563640	6568640	The game is like butter.
6568640	6570640	It's neither about hibiscus nor butterfly.
6570640	6572640	Discuss.
6572640	6575640	But that is the game that's coming out.
6575640	6580640	It looks, honestly, I get big dating sim vibes from it, but they talk like you make your
6580640	6586140	own drinks using ginger, mint, and chocolate, and make secret recipes, and you draw latte
6586140	6590640	art, because that is a fun, cute thing to do, I guess, and you relax in the coffee shop
6590640	6593140	atmosphere.
6593140	6599140	It is an urban fantasy game set in present-day Seattle where humans, orcs, elves, and other
6599140	6603140	races have been coexisting since the beginning of time.
6603140	6605140	Okay.
6605140	6609140	This game kind of sounds off the rails a little bit, but I'm into it.
6609140	6611640	So, that is out in Japan this week.
6611640	6612640	Let's see.
6612640	6615640	Going back to the Switch and some other games coming out in Japan this week.
6615640	6617640	Buck and Yar is out this week.
6617640	6620640	Akiba's Trip, Undead and Undressed Director's Cut.
6620640	6625640	That's a 10th anniversary edition that's coming out this week is also coming out.
6625640	6629640	Hatenna no Tu, the Tower of Children is out in Japan this week as well.
6629640	6632640	DNF Duel, also on the Switch this week.
6632640	6637640	A game called Hyper High Speed Genius with arrows.
6638140	6641140	It's a game about me.
6641140	6643140	Jamie, you got your game.
6643140	6645140	How about that?
6645140	6647140	Well, let me actually, DarkSaga, let me show you.
6647140	6652140	If I actually showed you some screenshots from Hyper High Speed Genius, I think you'll
6652140	6656140	be able to see exactly what kind of game this actually is.
6656140	6658140	So, here's some screens.
6658140	6660140	Yeah, I'm the one with the purple hair.
6660140	6663140	From Hyper High Speed Genius.
6663140	6665140	I've had that haircut before, actually.
6665140	6668640	It's got to be based on an anime or a visual novel or something, I don't know.
6668640	6670640	It looks like one of those.
6670640	6672640	It's one of those.
6672640	6674640	I'm making a terrible joke.
6674640	6680640	So, Hyper High Speed Genius, are they like internet people or something like that?
6680640	6685640	Is it like cheapified internet providers or something like that?
6685640	6686640	That'd be awful.
6686640	6691640	I would much rather play this game any day of the week than apparently what's coming
6691640	6694640	out on Xbox, which is very stable genius.
6694640	6696140	I don't want to play that game.
6696140	6698140	We're not going to play that game.
6698140	6700140	All right.
6700140	6709140	Here we have Xfinity Chan, who once every extra time you spend with her, she has to
6709140	6710140	charge you.
6710140	6712140	And then you have Spectrum Chan, who doesn't work half the time.
6712140	6714140	She falls asleep.
6714140	6716140	All right, moving on.
6716140	6717140	Can I finish?
6717140	6719140	Can I finish?
6719140	6720140	Canon.
6720140	6724140	I don't know if that's Kanan or Canon, but it's Canon with a K instead of a C. That is
6724140	6726640	going to go out on the Switch in Japan this week.
6726640	6728640	That's Canon.
6728640	6732640	Then I thought I would see the Advance Wars 1 and 2, but I don't actually see that for
6732640	6733640	Japan.
6733640	6737640	That is not actually being released there, or at least not this week.
6737640	6742640	Going to the PlayStation 5, however, Coffee Talk Episode 2 is also released there.
6742640	6744640	And that is really the big...
6744640	6746640	Oh, Minecraft Legends as well.
6746640	6751640	So not quite as much as you have on the Switch this week, but still a couple big titles there.
6751640	6752640	That's Japan.
6753140	6755140	How about the UK, Dr. Sakura?
6755140	6761140	On the 18th, we have Minecraft Legends for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.
6761140	6765140	And also for those on the same day, God of Rock.
6765140	6768140	Also on the 18th, The Pathless for Switch.
6768140	6772140	On the 20th, Labyrinth of Zangetsu.
6772140	6775140	That's for PlayStation and Switch.
6775140	6780140	Also on that day, Front Mission First Limited Edition.
6780140	6782140	That's for Switch.
6782140	6784640	The rest are for the 21st.
6784640	6787640	We have Advance Wars 1 and 2 reboot camp for Switch.
6787640	6790640	We have Dead Island 2 for PlayStation and Xbox.
6790640	6797640	Prodeus with a D, like a delta in the center, for PlayStation and Switch.
6797640	6801640	And Turnip Boy commits tax evasion for PlayStation.
6801640	6802640	That game is weird.
6802640	6803640	Nick's been playing that game.
6803640	6805640	Yeah, I was just going to say Nick was playing that the other day, yeah.
6805640	6807640	I've got like two copies of it.
6807640	6809640	The game's freaking weird.
6809640	6811640	I love it.
6812140	6813140	All right.
6813140	6816140	Before we get back into the news, I want to point this out.
6816140	6821140	So Matt in chat, as showrunner Matt says, because we were talking about Coffee Talk,
6821140	6825140	mentioning that Chapter 1 is actually on Xbox Game Pass.
6825140	6829140	And sure enough, while you were going over the release dates, I brought up, because I'm
6829140	6832140	broadcasting from my PC, and I brought up the Xbox app.
6832140	6835140	And sure enough, there's Coffee Talk available on Game Pass.
6835140	6839140	So if you want to check this out, this isn't something that's unique to Japan.
6839140	6841640	Now that I think about it, I think I have heard of this game before.
6841640	6843640	And it looks very interesting.
6843640	6846640	So that's interesting that they're getting like a sequel or something over there in Japan,
6846640	6847640	I guess.
6847640	6850140	Or maybe did they split it up or something over there?
6850140	6851140	I don't know.
6851140	6854640	But yeah, so if you want to check out Coffee Talk, it actually is on Xbox Game Pass.
6854640	6857140	And I'm sure that means on a variety of platforms here as well.
6857140	6862640	So it just has been under my radar as sometimes games go, because there's just so many of
6862640	6863640	them.
6863640	6865640	All right.
6866140	6869640	Well, I can tell you one game I don't have to worry about going into my backlog because
6869640	6870640	I don't know if it's ever coming out.
6870640	6872640	Loki.
6872640	6877640	Yeah, well, we talked about it seems like it's just yesterday that we were talking about
6877640	6879140	delays of Suicide Squad.
6879140	6882140	And here we are again talking about more delays of Suicide Squad.
6882140	6887640	So Suicide Squad is now no longer coming out in May.
6887640	6889140	Originally, it was delayed.
6889140	6891140	I don't remember what it was previously supposed to be coming out.
6891140	6894140	I think February or something like that.
6894140	6897140	And they were originally just going to do some polish on it.
6897140	6900140	Well, apparently, they're going to need to do a lot more polish because now the game's
6900140	6902140	coming out February 2024.
6902140	6908640	Yeah, so they said we've made a tough but necessary decision to take the time needed
6908640	6912140	to work on getting the game to be the best quality experience for players.
6912140	6915640	Thank you to our amazing community for the continued support, patience and understanding.
6915640	6918140	There's much more to share in the months ahead.
6918140	6920640	We look forward to seeing you in Metropolis next year.
6920640	6923640	Yeah, it's probably because the gameplay looked like garbage.
6923640	6928640	So, yeah, they probably need the overall a lot of stuff.
6928640	6930640	Can they do it in that amount of time, though?
6930640	6933140	I don't think you can do me.
6933140	6934140	I don't know.
6934140	6936140	No, we'll see.
6936140	6943640	Well, a bad game is bad forever, but a good game people will forgive the delays that did
6943640	6944640	it.
6944640	6945640	Okay.
6945640	6946640	Not always.
6946640	6948640	I mean, like you got like, no, man.
6948640	6949640	It's not bad.
6949640	6952640	It wasn't bad per se, but it was unfinished, I guess.
6952640	6955640	It wasn't what was promised for a lot of people that bought it.
6955640	6958640	It wasn't what was promised, but it eventually became a good game.
6958640	6959640	No, that's true.
6959640	6960640	That's true.
6960640	6961640	That would be like one of the sole exceptions.
6961640	6963640	Maybe Final Fantasy XIV as well.
6963640	6964640	Diablo 3.
6964640	6965640	I like the Holy Trinity.
6965640	6967640	Oh, and Destiny now is in that club, too.
6967640	6971640	So those are like your core examples of games.
6971640	6972640	That's right.
6972640	6974640	As it turns out, they were wrong.
6974640	6976640	Bad games don't have to be bad forever.
6976640	6978640	They could just be patched to hell.
6978640	6983640	Well, for the most part, unless, of course, the company gets sick and tired of patching
6983640	6989640	their game, and then they just give up on it, like 90% of the time.
6989640	6990640	Apex Legends.
6990640	6992640	It was not Apex Legends.
6992640	6998640	It was the one at the EA one.
6998640	7000640	That was Apex Legends.
7000640	7001640	Titanfall?
7001640	7003640	No, not Titanfall.
7003640	7004640	No, not Apex Legends.
7004640	7006640	Apex Legends is good.
7006640	7008640	Apex Legends has always been pretty well received.
7008640	7009640	No, no, no.
7009640	7010640	Not that one.
7010640	7016640	It's the EA one with the flying mech things, and it would look like it was going to be
7016640	7017640	cool, but then it sucked.
7017640	7018640	Oh, the BioWare one.
7018640	7019640	Yeah.
7019640	7020640	That never got better.
7020640	7021640	Anthem.
7021640	7022640	Anthem.
7022640	7023640	That never got better.
7023640	7027640	I knew it began with an A. I was like, no, it's not Apex Legends, because that's good.
7027640	7028640	No.
7028640	7029640	Yeah.
7029640	7030640	Anthem.
7030640	7031640	Yeah.
7031640	7035640	Like Anthem, where they just put out a roadmap, and they're like, I don't want to do that.
7035640	7039640	SHO 100 Matt in chat just points out, the core mechanics that people don't like, the
7039640	7041640	Ludo Schreuder live service stuff is going to stay.
7041640	7042640	This is just polish.
7042640	7043640	Yeah.
7043640	7049640	Pirate Pound Town in chat says, they had to delay because there wasn't a game to release.
7049640	7052640	There isn't even a crappy game to release at this point.
7052640	7053640	They've got nothing.
7053640	7057640	So, I'm assuming that's a little bit of a read on the whole, like what that same like
7057640	7062640	Games as a Service, you know, make the money, money, money.
7062640	7064640	It's not merchandising, merchandising, merchandising.
7064640	7072640	It's mini transaction, micro transaction, DLC, game as a service, live charge every
7072640	7074640	month, monthly fee without calling it that.
7074640	7076640	It's all those things they got to inject into the game.
7076640	7079640	I don't even know like why these companies try to run out through the Games as a Service
7079640	7082640	stuff, since most of them can't pull it off anyway, Square Enix.
7082640	7086640	So, I don't really know what the purpose, I guess, more money.
7086640	7087640	They want more money.
7087640	7089640	Got to have all the money.
7089640	7096640	You say that, but do recall and I get the read on, you know, Avengers is completely
7096640	7097640	appropriate.
7097640	7101640	However, keep in mind their biggest cash cow right now is Final Fantasy 14.
7101640	7107640	But that is still like an old school MMO model that only two other games that I can think
7107640	7112640	of in existence, at least in the US, can get away with and that's charging a monthly fee,
7112640	7116640	which will be World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 11.
7116640	7120640	So, I don't know of any other games that charge a monthly fee.
7120640	7121640	Where's my 11 remake?
7121640	7122640	Where's my 11 remake?
7122640	7125640	It got canned a long time ago.
7125640	7126640	I don't believe that.
7126640	7127640	You know what?
7127640	7129640	No, tired Final Fantasy 11 remake.
7129640	7130640	Wired?
7130640	7134640	Where the fuck is the Dragon Quest X offline game for the US?
7134640	7140640	Like, I thought the whole reason they made Dragon Quest X offline was so that they could
7140640	7143640	finally fucking bring that game to the US and we still haven't seen it.
7143640	7145640	Hello?
7145640	7148640	That's that.
7148640	7152640	You want to go play Final Fantasy 11, there's plenty of private servers, happy to welcome
7152640	7155640	you, that have the trust disabled.
7155640	7157640	And I don't think the book burning is even there too.
7157640	7159640	So, you can still go to the dunes like old times.
7159640	7161640	That's the stuff you miss.
7161640	7165640	Yeah, with the XP modifiers, it's like 10 times the XP where you can just solo your
7165640	7167640	way through the entire game.
7167640	7169640	It's actually a lot of fun.
7169640	7174640	It's more fun with people, obviously, but you know, I had a good time.
7174640	7175640	I would totally play that some more.
7175640	7179640	Several people in chat noting Final Fantasy 14, another example of bad games eventually
7179640	7180640	getting fixed.
7180640	7181640	I thought that was the first one you said, Loki.
7181640	7182640	Maybe I missed it.
7182640	7183640	It was like the second one I said.
7183640	7184640	Okay.
7184640	7187640	I knew it was the first one, then Final Fantasy 14 was the second one, but yeah.
7187640	7188640	All right.
7188640	7194640	Well, moving on, on the same note of patches and things like that, Dark Sakura.
7194640	7196640	Oh, yes.
7196640	7200640	Well, Capcom's in it again.
7200640	7209640	Apparently, there's a big Reddit discussion where it was discovered that the ray tracing
7209640	7215640	options have been disabled for Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes on Steam, as well as some
7215640	7222640	of the HDR not working the way it was intended to, and there's been no way to roll it back
7222640	7233640	or anything yet, but there is kind of a positive, is that the Danuvo was removed from the Steam
7233640	7236640	version of Resident Evil Village.
7236640	7237640	Oh.
7237640	7241640	So, because they showed how much better the game played without it, so it's gone.
7241640	7246640	Interesting, because that never was making the fans happy, so that's, oh, interesting
7246640	7248640	they actually removed it, huh?
7248640	7250640	Yep, it gone.
7250640	7251640	Interesting.
7251640	7254640	All right, well, something that's been added, and this is pretty historic.
7254640	7258640	Like, look, I know, what year was it that was the year of Luigi?
7258640	7261640	Was that 2017 or 2018 that we had the year of Luigi?
7261640	7267640	I gotta say, this just feels like the year of Mario, I mean, because of the movie, and
7267640	7271640	obviously doing very well, and you would think a game would come at some point this year,
7271640	7272640	but what do I know?
7272640	7275640	But, this is very big news as well.
7275640	7279640	It's just what a cultural phenomenon Super Mario Brothers has really cemented itself
7279640	7283640	as, you know, and if you're a gamer, you always knew this, but it seems like the rest
7283640	7285640	of pop culture is catching up.
7285640	7291640	Super Mario Brothers, the actual theme, is now going to be the first video game music
7291640	7295640	that is actually inducted into the Library of Congress.
7295640	7300640	The NRPB, which is the National Recording Preservation Board, has announced that Koji
7300640	7305640	Kondo's Super Mario Brothers theme will be preserved in the U.S. Library of Congress.
7305640	7309640	And, of course, that's a doo doo doo doo doo doo.
7309640	7314640	That is the first piece of video game music ever to join the NRPB's catalog of what they
7314640	7317640	call significant compositions.
7317640	7323640	Every year, 25 pieces of music are selected that are deemed culturally, historically,
7323640	7330640	or aesthetically significant, and or informs or reflects life in the United States.
7331640	7337640	To give you a perspective of what else is being inducted, Stairway to Heaven by Led
7337640	7343640	Zeppelin is being inducted this year, Like a Virgin by Madonna, Sweet Dreams Are Made
7343640	7347640	of This by Eurythmics, Imagine by John Lennon.
7347640	7348640	Is this the first year?
7348640	7350640	How have some of these songs not been in?
7350640	7352640	My goodness.
7352640	7353640	Wow.
7353640	7355640	Mike Deff says the year of Luigi was 2013.
7355640	7356640	It was that long ago?
7356640	7358640	Holy smokes.
7358640	7360640	And then this one actually made me laugh.
7360640	7364640	Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You is also...
7370640	7376640	And I'm not saying anything, but I'm just saying it has been noted that Take On Me by
7376640	7380640	A-ha was not actually inducted into the Hall of Fame.
7380640	7382640	I'm not saying, but I'm just saying.
7382640	7385640	So anyway, but I do love that song.
7385640	7386640	All right.
7386640	7390640	Anyhow, I totally just stole your story, didn't I, Loki?
7390640	7391640	It's all good.
7391640	7392640	Why don't you steal mine?
7392640	7393640	What do we got left?
7393640	7394640	Sounds good.
7394640	7400640	Yeah, we'll talk about the brand new game from the creators of Wordle is now debuting,
7400640	7404640	I guess, on The New York Times, because remember, hey, they have games now.
7404640	7405640	So it's called Digits.
7405640	7411640	It's a daily math puzzle game that originally when I first heard this, I thought it was
7411640	7414640	those stupid memes that they have on like Facebook.
7414640	7415640	I was like, you'll never guess this.
7415640	7417640	It's always order of operation questions.
7417640	7421640	But no, it's actually they give you a number and then a bunch of numbers below that.
7421640	7428640	You have to use basically the different, you know, arithmetic stuff to try to come up with
7428640	7429640	the final number.
7429640	7435640	So you can add your addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and you have to
7435640	7439640	use the numbers that are given to you to get to that number.
7439640	7442640	I swear I played something like this before.
7442640	7443640	I swear I did.
7443640	7444640	Okay.
7444640	7445640	Oh, 69.
7445640	7446640	Nice.
7446640	7447640	Okay.
7447640	7448640	Oh, is that today's number?
7448640	7449640	Today's number is 69.
7449640	7450640	Hold up.
7450640	7451640	Hold up.
7451640	7456640	Do these folks know how to get people on board to play or what?
7456640	7463640	I'm surprised it's not 69 for 20.
7463640	7468640	So you have to figure out how to use these numbers to make 69.
7468640	7469640	Yes.
7469640	7470640	Okay.
7470640	7472640	That might be difficult.
7472640	7473640	That might be difficult.
7473640	7474640	My goodness.
7474640	7475640	Okay.
7475640	7478640	Well, if you took, Oh, I don't know.
7478640	7480640	This would be incredibly boring radio.
7480640	7481640	I'm sorry.
7481640	7484640	I thought maybe I could try to show you like how to play digits thing.
7484640	7485640	It like gives you the answer.
7485640	7486640	Oh, I closed it.
7486640	7488640	I didn't watch it enough.
7488640	7489640	Yeah.
7489640	7490640	Interesting.
7490640	7492640	So you like you would add these.
7492640	7494640	So you do like three plus five.
7494640	7495640	Okay.
7495640	7497640	Is eight times seven.
7497640	7499640	Oh, eight.
7499640	7500640	Oh, eight.
7500640	7504640	Oh, they, they merge and become a new card after that.
7504640	7506640	Oh, okay.
7506640	7507640	Interesting.
7507640	7511640	I have to screw around with that at some point.
7511640	7513640	See if I can figure it out.
7513640	7514640	So cool.
7514640	7518640	Dejara mess and chat says arithmetic lounge radio.
7518640	7519640	Yes.
7519640	7520640	Yes.
7520640	7521640	Here we are.
7521640	7522640	Math.
7522640	7523640	It's fun.
7523640	7524640	Anyway, you know what else is fun is hearing from you all.
7524640	7529640	If you want to give us a call, you can over at our, I almost gave the, my brain went to
7529640	7534640	the old 800 number, which has been shut off for like 10 years.
7534640	7536640	My brain started to go eight, seven, seven game.
7536640	7537640	Woo.
7537640	7538640	Okay.
7538640	7539640	No, don't, don't use that.
7539640	7544640	But you can go to our discord over at vog network.com slash discord, and you can join the green
7544640	7547640	room and we'll hear from some of you that want to call in here.
7547640	7549640	We'll talk to you all here, live on air.
7550640	7555640	Or of course you can always just ask the question, our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog
7555640	7557640	network, VOG network.
7557640	7561640	And of course you can always email us, participate at orange lounge radio.com.
7561640	7564640	But sadly I think we have another week of a dry mailbag.
7564640	7566640	I don't think I saw anything come in there this week.
7566640	7567640	Are correct, sir.
7567640	7568640	Aha.
7568640	7569640	Yeah.
7569640	7572640	Defton chat says, can you even call that number anymore?
7572640	7574640	I'm sure you can, but you're not going to get us.
7574640	7579640	I'm sure it probably leads to a porn line or a, uh, something you don't want to hear
7579640	7580640	from.
7580640	7581640	I wouldn't, I would not advise it.
7581640	7582640	That's why I didn't finish saying the old number.
7582640	7585640	I would advise calling it cause I have no idea what it is.
7585640	7588640	So, Oh, one 800 porn.
7588640	7595640	Oh, well look, if we could have gotten that number back in the day, happily.
7595640	7603640	So for the record, I added, I added the suggested alert, Rob, a suggested alert.
7603640	7604640	Yeah.
7604640	7606640	I will tell you later.
7606640	7607640	Oh, okay.
7607640	7608640	All right.
7608640	7609640	Yeah.
7609640	7615640	But I'm testing things for us because I have an announcement to make.
7615640	7616640	Okay.
7616640	7624640	This week when I am not playing games, I am going to be working on new VOG merch.
7624640	7625640	Oh yay.
7625640	7626640	We've been missing that.
7626640	7631640	And I'll have to talk to you about setting up our fourth wall.
7631640	7632640	Cool.
7632640	7633640	Yeah.
7633640	7634640	We can do that.
7634640	7635640	Although that's probably a discussion Bobby needs to be into.
7635640	7638640	Cause he knows all the business stuff better than me, but yeah.
7638640	7640640	Um, but yeah, that'd be great.
7640640	7643640	Cause actually if we get that going, then I can get some merch just in time for dragon
7643640	7645640	con and wear some of that stuff there.
7645640	7646640	So that'd be good.
7646640	7648640	Cause yeah, if you haven't heard, I will be a dragon con that's all the way labor day
7648640	7649640	weekend though.
7649640	7652640	So I know not everybody's planning for that yet, but then again, dragon con, some people
7652640	7656640	wait all year for, so, you know, you might be thinking about it, but that will be Atlanta
7656640	7658640	over labor day weekend.
7658640	7659640	So there you go.
7659640	7664640	Um, I, um, yeah, I'm hoping there'll be some other stuff I can talk about real soon too,
7664640	7668640	as far as the convention stuff goes, but we'll, uh, we'll cross that bridge when we get to
7668640	7669640	it.
7669640	7677640	So, um, also I did mention earlier, but we're going to be, uh, not here on may 21st, which
7677640	7679640	is a very random day to not be here.
7679640	7680640	And it's completely my fault.
7680640	7681640	It's actually work's fault.
7681640	7684640	I'm going to a work conference and here's the weird thing.
7684640	7685640	I've never heard of this.
7685640	7690640	The work conference starts on a Sunday, which I've never like, what?
7690640	7693640	But yeah, like they have programming and everything on Sunday.
7693640	7696640	So I get to go listen to talks about my industry for my day job.
7696640	7697640	So I won't be here.
7697640	7698640	Sadly.
7698640	7699640	Yeah, I know.
7699640	7700640	Right.
7700640	7704640	Uh, I, and that's, I had to, I was supposed to host a show that Saturday night and now
7704640	7708640	I have to fly to where I'm going that Saturday night instead of, uh, doing that show.
7708640	7710640	I hate canceling that stuff.
7710640	7714640	Cause it's like when you, when you look unreliable, that's when they stop asking you to do it.
7714640	7719640	But you know, obviously he knows, I know he knows this out of my control and it gave
7719640	7723640	him absolutely as much notice as possible, but it's still, you know, it's, it's the inner
7723640	7724640	demons.
7724640	7725640	Yeah.
7725640	7728640	Uh, Dr. Sia says, let me know if the shirts come back.
7728640	7729640	We'll definitely be interested.
7729640	7730640	Awesome.
7730640	7731640	Awesome.
7731640	7732640	Pod culture's going back to dragon con this year.
7732640	7733640	Awesome.
7733640	7734640	I'm really happy to hear that.
7734640	7735640	Can't wait to see you.
7735640	7736640	It's been a long time.
7736640	7741640	So, um, I, as far as I know, we're supposed to still be involved with the same tracks
7741640	7742640	that I was last year.
7742640	7745640	I, I think I'll be on horror again this year.
7745640	7748640	I don't know for sure yet, but the other two look very favorable.
7748640	7753640	So, um, I haven't talked to the horror track, uh, individual, but I had a lot of fun doing
7753640	7754640	the panel I did there last year.
7754640	7755640	I'd love to do it again.
7755640	7757640	So we'll see.
7757640	7758640	All right.
7758640	7763640	Well, unfortunately we have a lack of calls, uh, waiting so that that's it.
7763640	7765640	We're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.
7765640	7767640	Um, but thank you of course, for being here tonight.
7767640	7771640	We appreciate all of the faces here live and we appreciate the faces on the podcast feed
7771640	7772640	as well.
7772640	7776640	If you enjoyed what you heard here on Orange Loon, Orange Loon's radio, if you enjoyed
7776640	7780640	what you heard here on Orange Lounge radio, my brain is malfunctioning.
7780640	7781640	Okay.
7781640	7784640	Since we're ending early tonight, I went out last night.
7784640	7786640	I'm in my forties now.
7786640	7787640	Okay.
7787640	7788640	No secret.
7788640	7789640	I, you know, and I, I love my forties.
7789640	7793640	I had a good time, but I don't go out and party or whatever you want to call it.
7793640	7798640	I got to bars and drink excessively the way I used to maybe 15, 20 years ago.
7798640	7803640	Last night I went out to a bar and drank excessively.
7803640	7809640	So today, if my brain seems like, wow, your wires are like not fully connected in your
7809640	7813640	brain today, you would be right.
7813640	7815640	See, I, I nailed it.
7815640	7816640	I nailed it.
7816640	7817640	I knew something was up.
7817640	7818640	Yeah.
7818640	7820640	And please, and I thought it was allergies.
7820640	7821640	Always do that stuff responsibly.
7821640	7823640	I had a ride there and a ride back.
7823640	7825640	I never operated the vehicle.
7825640	7827640	So just making that clear.
7827640	7829640	I never do that stuff unless I have a plan.
7829640	7834640	That's why usually that type of stuff and me drinking excessively is limited to two
7834640	7835640	times a year.
7835640	7838640	Number one, the star Trek cruise, cause I'm on a boat.
7838640	7839640	There's nowhere for me to drive to.
7839640	7845640	Number two, dragon con because, well, I'm not on a boat, but I'm a dragon con because
7845640	7851640	con period, any, anybody like drinking excessively is like one of the tent poles of a con.
7851640	7854640	There's, um, uh, panels.
7854640	7856640	There's the expo hall.
7856640	7860640	There's the dealer's room and there's drinking excessively.
7860640	7861640	Yeah.
7861640	7868640	But, but if that's funny though, I, I, I cannot say anything bad about that because the place
7868640	7874640	that you went to does, there's, there's, if it's the same person I'm thinking of makes
7874640	7876640	excellent drinks and a little strong.
7876640	7877640	Yeah.
7877640	7882640	But, and I'm just, and just to be full, if you are not a drinker, I just want to make
7882640	7884640	sure everybody knows we love our sober friends.
7884640	7885640	They help to give us rides.
7885640	7888640	Nobody should ever feel pressure to do that type of thing.
7888640	7892640	If drinking is not your thing, cause I don't want to just be out here glamorizing it.
7892640	7895640	It's just a silly thing that happens once in a great while.
7895640	7897640	So that's all.
7897640	7898640	Um, let's see.
7898640	7899640	Yeah.
7899640	7902640	S200 Matt says Rob is not Sally O'Malley.
7902640	7907640	No, but I did see Molly Shannon on Saturday Night Live recently bringing back that character
7907640	7908640	and it was everything.
7908640	7913640	Cause I'm 50, 50 years old.
7913640	7916640	That's, that's, that's going to be Travis Donovan pretty soon.
7916640	7921640	I hope, I hope to God Travis Donovan comes back to the internet just to say that, just
7921640	7924640	to say that when he turns 50.
7924640	7931640	And of course I'm getting advice from DJ Rama S saying drink Gatorade and Pedialyte.
7931640	7932640	You can thank me later.
7932640	7936640	I definitely had vitamin water, which is basically a very similar sort of thing.
7936640	7940640	Uh, today you want to, you also want to have a vitamin B12.
7940640	7941640	Yes.
7941640	7944640	I have this, um, like Mio stuff that's infused with B12.
7944640	7948640	And if you've seen an orange drink in here earlier, that was exactly what that was, was
7948640	7949640	B12 infused.
7949640	7954640	Although I will tell you the cocktail that I would make for everybody, it would be a
7954640	7962640	very nasty, potent tea that works wonders with, uh, made of ginger.
7962640	7965640	And I think sometimes I would do peppermint.
7965640	7967640	Peppermint and ginger are weird together.
7967640	7975640	And willow bark, the stuff that the origin of salicylic acid, which is salicin, what
7975640	7980640	they make aspirin from, which is acetylsalicylic acid.
7980640	7986640	All right, well, we're very clearly off topic enough where it's time to wrap it up for tonight,
7986640	7988640	but I want to thank you all for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.
7988640	7992640	If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show tonight, or if you didn't, you know,
7992640	7995640	try again next week, maybe it'll be more on topic, but I hope you did enjoy tonight's
7995640	7996640	show.
7996640	7998640	We had a lot of awesome, great stuff.
7998640	7999640	Tell a friend or two about the show.
7999640	8002640	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
8002640	8004640	need more voices to put out here on air.
8004640	8006640	So, you know, spread the word.
8006640	8007640	Social media posts are awesome.
8007640	8009640	I can't tell you how much those help.
8009640	8013640	A five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this podcast,
8013640	8016640	those go an awful long way as well.
8016640	8021640	We will be back in seven days to do this all again next week.
8021640	8024640	Dark Soccer, I know you have a big personal stream coming up on your birthday, and now
8024640	8028640	I know this entire time I thought the 19th was Thursday.
8028640	8029640	I knew your birthday was 19th.
8029640	8031640	I just thought the 19th was Thursday.
8031640	8032640	So it's actually Wednesday.
8032640	8035640	So you're having an all day stream on Wednesday.
8035640	8037640	Starting at 10 a.m. Pacific time.
8037640	8038640	Alright, sounds good.
8038640	8040640	DarkSakura underscore O-L-R.
8040640	8041640	Sounds good.
8041640	8043640	Good luck and happy early birthday.
8043640	8045640	Thank you.
8045640	8046640	Oh, you signed off.
8046640	8048640	I was going to give you a final thought, but if that was it, so be it.
8048640	8049640	Oh, yeah, I thought that.
8049640	8051640	Okay, well, I'll say something else.
8051640	8052640	Please.
8053640	8060640	If I hit 250 subs, I'll bleach my hair during the stream.
8060640	8062640	Alright, good times.
8062640	8063640	I have Olaplex.
8063640	8064640	I'm serious about this.
8064640	8065640	This is a beauty stream.
8065640	8069640	And then I'll promptly dye it red again.
8069640	8072640	Alright, have a good one, DarkSakura.
8072640	8073640	Bye.
8073640	8074640	Alright, Loki, we'll go to you.
8074640	8076640	What's your final thought tonight?
8076640	8078640	It's jury duty week.
8078640	8080640	Oh, that's right.
8080640	8084640	Oh, may you be blessed with the blessings I had earlier this month.
8084640	8092640	Well, now the update is I have to stand by to check again on Tuesday.
8092640	8094640	Like, I have to check Tuesday evening.
8094640	8096640	So, it's the latter half of this week or not.
8096640	8099640	Oh, okay, I was going to say I went in on Tuesday and you saw how that went for me.
8099640	8103640	So, okay, but you checked Tuesday to maybe go in on Wednesday.
8103640	8106640	Yeah, I still don't want to do that.
8106640	8109640	Work wants me to come into the office too.
8109640	8111640	I won't do that either.
8111640	8114640	So, it's a week if I don't want to do things.
8114640	8116640	I don't want to.
8116640	8122640	And my final thought tonight is I'm more than likely, unless I'm seriously missing something with the story,
8122640	8125640	I'm more than likely beating Pokemon Legends Arceus on my stream tomorrow.
8125640	8128640	So, I hope to see you over at Rob Roberts on Twitch.
8128640	8131640	And yeah, excited for what the coming months have to bring.
8131640	8134640	I've got a lot going on at work, but it's good stuff.
8134640	8137640	I really like my job, but very busy for me this month.
8137640	8140640	So, yeah, sadly it's kind of cutting into the games a little bit,
8140640	8144640	but the live streaming has been a good way to stay on top of at least one game.
8144640	8146640	So, all right, that's it.
8146640	8149640	That's going to do it for our episode tonight here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8149640	8151640	I hope you all have a wonderful week.
8151640	8153640	We will see you in seven days to do it all again.
