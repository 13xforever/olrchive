WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.680
Samba de Amigo Party Central is going to have Escape from the City and I am immensely

00:13.680 --> 00:14.720
excited about this.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.680
The article doesn't specify which version it is, I'm holding out hope it might be

00:17.680 --> 00:20.960
the Cash Cash or Blue Blur remix from Sonic Generations, but I expect it's going to

00:20.960 --> 00:23.000
be the original version from Sonic Adventure 2.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.640
For a game that revolves around Samba thematically and dance generally, it's a toss up as to

00:26.640 --> 00:28.720
which version would be considered best for the game.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.160
This is your Byla Byla update, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers

00:32.160 --> 00:34.920
and Loki to tell you the other detail from that article and the rest of the week's

00:34.920 --> 00:35.920
gaming news.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.920
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.920 --> 00:45.840
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:45.840 --> 00:48.560
where every gamer has a voice.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.960
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:50.960 --> 00:58.640
We are live once again tonight, April the 2nd of 2023 with episode number 954 of our

00:58.640 --> 00:59.640
show.

00:59.640 --> 01:04.240
I'm very thankful it is April the 2nd, that way you all know no April Fool's jokes

01:04.240 --> 01:07.160
on tonight's show because that holiday is silly.

01:07.160 --> 01:13.880
I would like to see April Fool's Day become April Memes Day where you save your best meme

01:13.880 --> 01:16.960
for the whole year and then unleash the memes on that day.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.040
That's what I think we should change.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.060
What do you think, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers, who's here every week?

01:22.060 --> 01:23.060
Memes Day, who's in?

01:23.060 --> 01:24.060
Cool.

01:24.060 --> 01:30.040
I did nothing but memes for like five years all about Mass Effect.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.040
There you go.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.040
I can do this.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.080
You've got a stock ready to go.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.800
And then that way people aren't believing fake news.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.920
I can't tell you how many things I saw posted on Facebook yesterday where it was like, did

01:40.920 --> 01:43.040
you not check the calendar?

01:43.040 --> 01:45.160
No RuPaul is not leaving Drag Race.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.040
I know, but to anybody out there listening who did.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.840
I saw very little on Twitter, come to think of it.

01:51.840 --> 01:52.840
Really?

01:52.840 --> 01:57.680
I think that just a lot of the people I know are like, April Fool's Day is bullshit and

01:57.680 --> 01:59.720
just don't participate anymore.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.720
Yeah, yeah.

02:00.720 --> 02:06.040
I think there's kind of just like a whole generation out there that just is over April

02:06.040 --> 02:07.800
Fool's Day, quite frankly.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.080
You know what April 1st is?

02:10.080 --> 02:12.360
The beginning of my birthday.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
Your birthday month.

02:13.360 --> 02:20.640
My birthday month, which I celebrate all month because me being alive is a gift to the universe.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.640
We'll also say hello joining us every week.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
Another gift to the universe.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.200
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
Hello.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
Hi, Loki.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
How are you?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.200
I'm fine.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.560
Are you a big April Fool's Day fan?

02:30.560 --> 02:34.680
I'm a fan of consuming April Fool's stuff.

02:34.680 --> 02:35.680
Yes.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.680
Okay.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.680
All right.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.680
Fine.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.680
How about April Memes Day?

02:39.680 --> 02:40.680
I mean, yeah, that'd be cool.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.440
Like a Meme Oscars or something like that.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.440
The Meme Oscars.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.840
I love it.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
The best.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.840
The best.

02:47.840 --> 02:52.080
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, at

02:52.080 --> 02:56.880
the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, where you can chat along with

02:56.880 --> 02:57.880
our show.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.880
Or tonight, the listeners being very generous right now.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.080
We're all the way up to a level six hype train.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.840
Loki, you had a lot to do with that.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.440
You just gave out like 15 gift subs in chat, so thank you very much and thanks to everybody.

03:08.440 --> 03:13.280
I will always ... Because we are taping a podcast here, I usually don't read out all

03:13.280 --> 03:16.880
of those acknowledgements until the very end, but if you're here until the end, I will absolutely

03:16.880 --> 03:17.880
shout all that out.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.160
It also scrolls along the bottom of the screen, like a little CNN news ticker or something,

03:22.160 --> 03:27.000
so please know we love all you guys that go the extra mile with your participation.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.120
Speaking of participating, hmm.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.720
I just have to point out who's in chat today.

03:30.720 --> 03:35.440
Well, I was actually going to read a comment from Shayla in chat who says, I have coffee

03:35.440 --> 03:36.560
and it woke me up.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.800
It has the extreme caffeine.

03:37.840 --> 03:42.880
Well, that makes two of us, Shayla, because I'm drinking coffee here as we're getting

03:42.880 --> 03:45.440
started here at the top of the show, as I tend to do, so.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.360
Shayla is infamous.

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
From your stream, yeah.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.120
From our team, Yeet, as the queen of chaos and the killer tamer.

03:53.120 --> 03:58.920
Yeah, she really cracked me up the way ... Because I lurk in your stream and I think I even played

03:58.920 --> 03:59.920
games with Shayla.

03:59.920 --> 04:00.920
I'm almost positive I did at one point.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.920
Yeah, I think you might have.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.840
Just running up and trying to boop the killer and do all those things, just you know.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.120
My impersonation of Shayla, I love you.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.120
That's good.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.120
That's good.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.120
I love you.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.120
Boop.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.120
I love you.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.120
Morimi.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.120
Come over.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.120
Morimi.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.120
Morimi.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.120
All right.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.120
Anyway.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.120
Hence the reason I made that particular shirt.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.120
The Morimi shirt is all about Shayla.

04:24.120 --> 04:29.400
Andrew 200 Matt in chat says, would have thought Rob would have brought the tea for tonight's

04:29.400 --> 04:30.400
E3 talk.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
Well, you know what?

04:31.400 --> 04:33.200
It's all the same mug at the end of the day.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
Oh.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.360
Oh, we have that topic to get into at the start of the show.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.360
Do we?

04:37.360 --> 04:41.680
Well, what a lovely segue into our kickoff topic for tonight.

04:41.680 --> 04:46.440
Look, all of you that listen to this show, I'm sure many of you follow what's going on

04:46.440 --> 04:51.120
in the industry, so this news isn't going to come as a shock, but we're going to talk

04:51.120 --> 04:52.120
about it.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.600
I am completely shocked.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.880
I may have a thing or two to say about this that might shock you.

04:56.880 --> 05:02.080
So, Loki, what's the big headline on everyone's mind this week?

05:02.160 --> 05:07.520
So first the news came out from IGN, from inside sources that said, hey, E3 is done

05:07.520 --> 05:12.920
or E3 has been canceled this year, probably because everybody's leaving E3.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.800
No one's actually, you know, displaying their games there.

05:16.800 --> 05:25.760
Then prompted from that kind of reveal or scoop or whatever, the ESA or on the E3 accounts

05:25.760 --> 05:29.600
basically said, hey, read pop and entertainment software association have announced that both

05:29.600 --> 05:34.120
the digital and physical events for E3 2023 are canceled.

05:34.120 --> 05:40.040
And then they did like an interview, I think, with I forget which site had a game industry

05:40.040 --> 05:49.280
biz talking about the reasons they were blaming COVID-19 and a bad economy for some of the

05:49.280 --> 05:53.520
reasons for the cancellation.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.400
I mean, we knew that they would do that.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.640
Did I not see the author of that article respond to you on Twitter going, it is not

06:00.640 --> 06:04.080
COVID-19, it is not COVID-19.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.600
I'm almost positive I saw that reply on Twitter somewhere.

06:07.600 --> 06:13.280
But regardless, that is certainly something they're pointing at as a reason amongst several

06:13.280 --> 06:17.560
reasons with what's going on and certainly was a reason that they haven't done the show

06:17.560 --> 06:22.400
for the past few years, including last year when most shows were coming back.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.480
Whether it was a good idea or not with the pandemic going on, that's another discussion.

06:27.480 --> 06:32.280
But most shows were coming back, E3 did not and said it was COVID-19, even though that

06:32.280 --> 06:37.920
didn't seem to stop most of the other shows last year, but it is what it is.

06:37.920 --> 06:42.000
And I do see some comments in chat, Shayla is asking, what is E3?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Kind of less familiar.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.880
And to be fair, there hasn't been one since 2019.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.800
So we're going on four years now, there hasn't been an E3.

06:49.800 --> 06:56.600
So once upon a time, there was a trade show that was created for the gaming industry.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.580
It was where work becomes fun.

06:59.580 --> 07:00.580
That is E3.

07:00.580 --> 07:04.720
And it was a chance for the game industry to get together and show off the games that

07:04.720 --> 07:06.920
they're making to retailers.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.820
Also because, you know, people from Montgomery Ward would come to the show and Kmart would

07:11.820 --> 07:17.620
come out to E3, I said once upon a time, for what they're going to stock their shelves

07:17.620 --> 07:18.620
with this year.

07:18.660 --> 07:23.740
Bobby on his show tonight was showing an ad from 1998 that was talking about Pokemon and

07:23.740 --> 07:28.500
how they were selling that to Toys R Us the first time, you know, this trade show was

07:28.500 --> 07:29.500
going on.

07:29.500 --> 07:32.180
And so it was a place for the industry to get together.

07:32.180 --> 07:36.100
And then, you know, it might be, let's go out and have some drinks and have some gnarly

07:36.100 --> 07:42.140
parties and, you know, just get together in the industry and do things and all that stuff.

07:42.140 --> 07:47.460
Google at the booth babes, you know, they would always like, it was the misogynistic

07:47.460 --> 07:52.160
like kind of take on the whole thing that they just had to plaster that around as well.

07:52.160 --> 07:57.620
There was absolutely, especially in the early years, that mindset of the quote unquote boys

07:57.620 --> 08:02.780
club that the video game industry was, and some would say still is, although there's

08:02.780 --> 08:07.060
kind of treated it like a hot red show almost like it's like trying to get people to come

08:07.060 --> 08:08.060
to their booth.

08:08.060 --> 08:12.020
Now, I'm not going to razz E3 for that because they came a long way in the later years.

08:12.020 --> 08:16.460
So forth, you know, they progressed with the rest of the industry that has nothing

08:16.460 --> 08:21.060
to do with the reasons why they're no longer around as a show.

08:21.060 --> 08:26.140
But what ended up happening as time went on, this thing out there got more and more popular

08:26.140 --> 08:30.940
and it's called the internet and they would bring it into your house with cable, you know,

08:30.940 --> 08:35.420
used to dial into it, but you know, that only let the internet move so fast.

08:35.420 --> 08:40.860
But once they started bringing in the internet and cable lines, you could get video on demand.

08:40.860 --> 08:43.740
You could watch video on demand, much like you're watching TV.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.460
Actually, I think that's what y'all are doing right now with this very program.

08:46.460 --> 08:49.700
I mean, you might be listening to it on the podcast feed, but that's a very similar sort

08:49.700 --> 08:51.180
of thing, right?

08:51.180 --> 08:56.860
And this is what started happening to E3 is that E3 just got televised at home and all

08:56.860 --> 09:01.060
those trailers broadcast right into your home and everything there, there ended up being

09:01.060 --> 09:04.980
less and less of a reason to actually go to E3 because more and more of it you could experience

09:04.980 --> 09:06.840
from your couch.

09:06.840 --> 09:11.600
Did my grandpa tell you a story about E3 2010?

09:11.600 --> 09:12.600
Maybe 2012?

09:12.600 --> 09:21.800
It was one of those years I went and I had to justify at the Ubisoft booth why I deserved

09:21.800 --> 09:24.200
a ticket to see their little show.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.440
Like oh yes, I have a long running podcast.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.160
Yes, we have XYZ number of listeners.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.160
Yeah, we do.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.440
You know, and basically, you know, somebody's being very skeptical like, I don't know.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.440
Okay.

09:34.440 --> 09:40.800
And then they let me in to a half empty theater and I get to see a trailer for the new Assassin's

09:40.800 --> 09:43.440
Creed game, which granted looks really good.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.560
And I saw a trailer for a bunch of other games.

09:45.560 --> 09:52.920
I go back to the hotel that night and I see on YouTube the exact same trailer that I had

09:52.920 --> 09:56.640
to justify why I should get into the theater to see.

09:56.640 --> 10:01.200
That was the moment Rob Roberts started to realize this show really isn't what it used

10:01.200 --> 10:06.400
to be and that the things that we experienced at the show and what's behind closed doors

10:06.400 --> 10:09.480
and all that ain't what it used to be.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.080
And Tiger class said, yep, once the internet became fast enough, it was like you were actually

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
there.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.080
Yeah.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.520
And then you had television networks on cable that were broadcasting 24 seven sorta, but

10:18.520 --> 10:22.900
for the most part all day long from that experience, et cetera, et cetera.

10:22.900 --> 10:30.120
So the show started to basically lose its relevance as a news breaking sort of thing,

10:30.200 --> 10:36.520
which is what E3 became known for over the years, even though E3 was supposed to be a

10:36.520 --> 10:40.640
trade show for the industry to get together and wheel and deal.

10:40.640 --> 10:46.440
But unfortunately at the same time, the internet was ruining this element of the conversation.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.100
Do you remember back earlier when I was telling this story, I mentioned some of the retailers

10:50.100 --> 10:56.440
that would go Montgomery Ward, Kmart, what happened to all these retailers?

10:56.440 --> 11:01.300
They're also less of relevance that they used to be because of this little thing called

11:01.300 --> 11:07.200
the internet and be it direct purchasing, direct to your house deliveries, all of those

11:07.200 --> 11:08.200
types of things.

11:08.200 --> 11:13.400
I'm not saying that places like GameStop, Target and places you can walk in and get

11:13.400 --> 11:17.440
physical games don't exist anymore, but I think you all know it looks a lot different

11:17.440 --> 11:22.620
in the year 2023 than it used to hell even in the year 2019 and certainly versus the

11:22.620 --> 11:27.900
year 2006, which was the last like epic E3 type of year, basically.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.180
Yeah, thank you, Bobby.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.600
When we say theater, we mean like a theater built into a booth.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.380
So it's like, yeah, four wall, it's a mini theater.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.860
It's like Black Wolf Manor's basement theater.

11:39.860 --> 11:40.860
It was like that.

11:40.860 --> 11:41.860
Okay.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.220
When you go to an electronic store and they have like, here's the demo set up for our

11:45.220 --> 11:48.060
surround sound system theater type of thing.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.500
And Shayla, don't apologize.

11:49.500 --> 11:55.240
Of course you're learning, but you're also bringing up a very, very important point.

11:55.240 --> 12:01.000
Unless you'd gone to E3, your brain was left to fill in a lot of the gaps on these sort

12:01.000 --> 12:02.260
of things.

12:02.260 --> 12:07.420
So when you were talking about going to the Square Enix theater to see the Final Fantasy

12:07.420 --> 12:11.980
13 versus trailer, and you're reading about that in a magazine, a lot of people are reading

12:11.980 --> 12:16.580
out thinking, Ooh, they have a whole theater there on the floor.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.580
Wow.

12:17.580 --> 12:20.500
This place must be big.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.620
I was breaking into my Jennifer Coolidge there for a little minute.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.620
Wow.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.100
Dish Avantage, big.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.100
Just like my exes.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.100
Oh, forget it.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.100
Anyway.

12:29.100 --> 12:32.780
One of the issues with E3 and those who can attend it can relate to says Tiger Claw is

12:32.780 --> 12:34.940
the long longs just to try out a demo.

12:34.940 --> 12:35.940
Yes.

12:35.940 --> 12:36.940
Very that.

12:36.940 --> 12:37.940
Well, yeah.

12:37.940 --> 12:42.580
And then, and then on top of that, like even when you go there, it seemed like, you know,

12:42.580 --> 12:47.100
it was hard to keep track of like everything that you can't see everything in time.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.780
And even if you knew like what you wanted to see and you could get through all the lines

12:49.780 --> 12:53.560
and stuff, it's hard to keep track of like everything that's going on because you're

12:53.560 --> 12:54.620
there in person.

12:54.620 --> 13:01.180
Whereas if you're on the Internet, you can just digest it on any number of gaming websites

13:01.180 --> 13:05.380
that have all the headlines that they've been sent pre, you know, in advance by these game

13:05.380 --> 13:06.380
companies.

13:06.380 --> 13:07.380
Pretty much.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.140
I mean, it's been that way.

13:10.140 --> 13:15.140
Critch Peacefuzz in chat, HiHi says, I thought it was the studios that killed E3 who pulled

13:15.140 --> 13:18.260
out, made their own event with hookers and cocaine.

13:18.260 --> 13:22.740
I was just about to tell the Nintendo Direct starting this trend.

13:22.740 --> 13:28.180
The Nintendo Direct was very much a beginning of the end and then Sony realized it could

13:28.180 --> 13:29.300
work for them as well.

13:29.300 --> 13:34.540
Now, I wouldn't necessarily attach hookers and cocaine to Nintendo.

13:34.540 --> 13:39.360
But there's a certain part of the dark side of these trade show cultures that you all

13:39.400 --> 13:46.320
have read about, unfortunately, that doesn't exist when you do the direct approach online

13:46.320 --> 13:49.640
because people aren't gathering in a place and so forth.

13:49.640 --> 13:55.280
So anyway, Loki, did you want to continue?

13:55.280 --> 13:59.160
I know we've kind of got to, but I know maybe you want to talk a little bit about what's

13:59.160 --> 14:01.440
next and that sort of thing.

14:01.440 --> 14:07.080
So well, one of the things like, so they mentioned COVID-19, not necessarily COVID-19 as in the

14:07.080 --> 14:11.600
disease itself is causing people not to attend or something like that.

14:11.600 --> 14:19.320
It's more of that they're saying that COVID-19 altered the way studios develop games, I guess,

14:19.320 --> 14:23.560
because now they're doing it remotely, you know, whereas they're maybe their release

14:23.560 --> 14:26.840
schedules slowed a little bit because of that.

14:26.840 --> 14:31.440
I mean, maybe like in the first year, but like, you know, this many years afterwards,

14:31.440 --> 14:32.440
adapted.

14:32.440 --> 14:37.020
I mean, I think Yeah, I think by now three years like if you haven't adapted yet to

14:37.540 --> 14:43.140
being remote or working remotely, you're just not going to succeed as a business because

14:43.140 --> 14:44.140
you have to adapt quickly.

14:44.140 --> 14:48.740
You can't just take Oh, well, what's gonna take us like 10 years to adapt to this.

14:48.740 --> 14:53.940
So I don't necessarily buy I think it's more of a situation where, sure, they're going

14:53.940 --> 14:54.940
to blame all that.

14:54.940 --> 14:56.740
So they're not going to say, well, it's because we're irrelevant.

14:56.740 --> 15:00.220
I mean, they're not going to say that at all, obviously.

15:00.220 --> 15:05.660
It's because these studios have figured out that, hey, one, we don't have to pay the you

15:05.660 --> 15:12.820
know, this expensive cost to set up a booth at this event, and have to share the spotlight

15:12.820 --> 15:18.940
with all these other studios, we could spend a fraction of that, set up our own event where

15:18.940 --> 15:23.740
all eyes are on us, and just do whatever we want with it.

15:23.740 --> 15:25.940
And I think that's just makes more sense.

15:25.940 --> 15:30.780
It's less manpower for them to do all this, it's less cost for them to do it.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.600
And it's more of a return out of it.

15:32.600 --> 15:37.480
So of course, that's why the industry is going the way that they're going.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.400
That said, though, like, it's also funny to see them compare, you know, compare this stuff

15:41.400 --> 15:46.800
to, you know, COVID-19, and all its other tribute, all that, but then you have like,

15:46.800 --> 15:48.760
you know, CES and stuff like that.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.440
And I don't think that's ever like, gone down as far as

15:52.440 --> 15:57.560
Tokyo game show and Gamescom are still going on a schedule exactly, even a couple rough

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
years.

15:58.560 --> 16:02.080
So so like, I don't, I don't understand how those are successful.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.600
It's basically the same type of thing.

16:04.600 --> 16:09.620
Somebody said very plainly, why E3 died.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.280
Somebody very plainly said it.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.160
We'll come back to that in a minute, because I'm gonna I'm gonna point it out and underline

16:14.160 --> 16:16.360
it when we get there.

16:16.360 --> 16:20.320
Because it's it's very, very much the reason why it died.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.000
But we'll get there in a minute.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.040
Go ahead and tell us the rest of the news, Loki.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.040
Yeah.

16:26.040 --> 16:32.760
So basically, you know, they, you know, said also that E3 is becoming less popular.

16:32.760 --> 16:37.680
You know, while, you know, confirmed by ESA and E3 organized a repop before the report,

16:37.680 --> 16:41.040
they said many have started the question if the annual trade show was actually going to

16:41.040 --> 16:43.160
happen or not.

16:43.160 --> 16:48.240
You know, just was it right before this announcement went out that they were canceling show Ubisoft

16:48.240 --> 16:50.960
confirmed that they weren't attending.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.760
Previous to that, of course, you had Sony saying they're skipping E3, Microsoft already

16:54.760 --> 16:56.920
confirmed that they weren't going as well.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.240
It's like, who's left?

16:59.240 --> 17:01.200
I mean, like, there's not much left.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.120
Nintendo is obviously not going.

17:03.120 --> 17:09.680
So it's just, I think once again, it's going back to the they're becoming less relevant.

17:09.680 --> 17:15.560
And they can't sustain it either with having, you know, the public come in because, yeah,

17:15.560 --> 17:16.600
the public can come in.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.680
But what are you gonna show them?

17:17.680 --> 17:24.720
There's no one here like, I don't know, it was just I don't think it's sustainable anymore.

17:25.520 --> 17:34.760
So somebody E3 tried to partner with in those last years before the pandemic hit, Jeff Keighley

17:34.760 --> 17:38.360
has had some interesting chess moving pieces as a result of this.

17:38.360 --> 17:42.480
Can we can we get to some of that for the whole like, what's gonna happen now in June

17:42.480 --> 17:43.480
type of thing?

17:43.480 --> 17:47.560
Yeah, let me see if I can find that here real quick.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.840
I don't remember necessarily what Jeff Keighley is doing, but Summer Game Fest.

17:51.520 --> 17:56.560
Well, I mean, yeah, I know that but like, I didn't know what, like recent additions

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
to that.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.560
Just that it's happening.

17:58.560 --> 18:04.000
And there's, there's, he's very much been kind of hyping it up a bit tactfully around

18:04.000 --> 18:07.960
the E3 cancellation news, which I want to come back to an earlier point, because here

18:07.960 --> 18:11.520
it is because I left you all the cliffhanger hit it here.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.000
But here's the person who told you why E3 was canceled, it's Jeff Keighley.

18:15.040 --> 18:22.680
And it's it's it was a tweet that he very much kept in the drafts until this announcement

18:22.680 --> 18:24.240
came out and then he hit send.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.340
And here's the tweet.

18:26.340 --> 18:30.320
Here's 15 year old me at the first ever E3 in 1995.

18:30.320 --> 18:34.080
E3 meant so much to me and so many of you too.

18:34.080 --> 18:41.040
Four years ago, I realized E3 wasn't evolving as it needed to compete in a global digital

18:41.040 --> 18:42.040
world.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.040
So we started building what's next.

18:44.080 --> 18:50.880
E3 at Summer Game Fest, June 8th, and there it is somebody from the inside, because remember

18:50.880 --> 18:55.880
Jeff was working with E3 to try to fix some of these problems four years ago, stating

18:55.880 --> 19:04.120
very plainly and accurately why E3 is done, E3 wasn't evolving as it needed to compete

19:04.120 --> 19:07.160
in a global digital world.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.400
That's why E3 is dead.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.080
It did not evolve in many ways.

19:11.080 --> 19:14.400
Honestly, and honestly, I don't even know why they bothered announcing that it was going

19:14.400 --> 19:17.280
to be coming back to begin with knowing what they know.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.280
Safe phase.

19:18.280 --> 19:23.480
Well, it's it's also it's it's the direction they're going looking worse.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.240
How are they saving any face when they knew it would make them look worse?

19:26.240 --> 19:28.240
It it's two different like purposes.

19:28.240 --> 19:29.840
Each event had two different purposes.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.760
Yeah, like a lot of it was game announcements and stuff, but E3 was supposed to be working

19:33.760 --> 19:40.320
with retail and their distributor partners to, you know, have meetings about like, hey,

19:40.320 --> 19:41.320
where are we going?

19:41.320 --> 19:42.320
I mean, sure.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.960
Getting the public excited about it as well.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.840
That just goes back into sales stuff.

19:45.840 --> 19:50.800
But when you're talking about a market that's consolidated a ton, you know, not only like

19:50.800 --> 19:54.180
mom and pop video game shops, not a lot of them out there anymore.

19:54.180 --> 19:58.600
The number of distributors that are out there that actually supply those places dwindling

19:58.600 --> 20:03.200
down as we, you know, very few probably.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.960
And then we're talking like retailers.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.280
I mean, there's not a lot of retailers out there anymore.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.680
Either you have, you know, your target, Wal-Mart, that type of stuff.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.680
But like.

20:10.680 --> 20:16.200
I mean, sure, they'll have meetings and stuff, but also, you know, for those not in the know,

20:16.200 --> 20:21.480
outside of E3, they still have meetings like there's the whole PlayStation event that's

20:21.480 --> 20:26.040
a destination PlayStation where they show the same type of stuff they have, like they're

20:26.040 --> 20:28.280
almost like a mini E3 for all Sony stuff.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.560
I'm sure Microsoft does something similar.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.320
That's where those talks are happening now, not E3.

20:33.320 --> 20:39.840
And so you never hear about destination PlayStation or like GameStop's internal like conferencing

20:39.840 --> 20:43.040
that they have as well, because all that stuff's kept under lock and key.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.360
As far as announcements and stuff go, it's all strategizing and everything.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.720
So yeah, they're kind of irrelevant now.

20:49.720 --> 20:55.880
So but the reason why Jeff Keighley is successful, because his intent and purpose isn't necessarily

20:55.880 --> 21:01.960
to make deals with retailers, it's to promote the different games that these companies want

21:01.960 --> 21:03.320
to promote and show.

21:03.320 --> 21:09.480
So they come in, they're utilizing his platform to send the message out to a captive audience

21:09.480 --> 21:13.120
about what's coming out to get people hyped up about that.

21:13.120 --> 21:20.200
And then he is, of course, using that to drive this event for upcoming years.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.440
So he can do all these fun things where they show off different stuff, because the focus

21:23.440 --> 21:25.900
isn't on making these retail agreements.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.360
It's about promoting these games.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.320
It's a big commercial is basically it.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.320
Yep.

21:31.360 --> 21:35.280
Jeff has asked that question that the ESA needed asked quite some time ago, and that

21:35.280 --> 21:40.600
was what is special about this event that's going to make people want to come here and

21:40.600 --> 21:44.440
not do their own thing digitally, instead of trying to apply the template that had worked

21:44.440 --> 21:45.440
for years and years prior.

21:45.440 --> 21:49.960
I want to get to a couple of comments here from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

21:49.960 --> 21:54.640
She Hulk 10 says the game companies are cutting back, not investing in their people, customers

21:54.640 --> 21:59.320
and so forth, stopping E3, canceling the company, picnics, breaks, PTO, safety meetings, catered

21:59.320 --> 22:02.320
lunches, so forth, all money must be given to stockholders.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.800
So E3 is just an expense the company's turned off accurate assessment.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.620
Quite frankly, I would say to, to kind of take that a step further again, it goes back

22:10.620 --> 22:15.840
to the ESA did not give a reason why you had to go to E3.

22:15.840 --> 22:20.200
They did not create enough of a, of a must as to why to do that.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.640
And again, we're looking at a lot of this.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.120
I look very much at commentary on the ESA has nothing to do with read pop.

22:26.120 --> 22:29.600
I'm sure read pop tried everything they could, but it was too far gone at that point.

22:29.600 --> 22:35.100
They came in the picture too late, essentially the ESA has refused to evolve for the longest

22:35.100 --> 22:36.100
time.

22:36.100 --> 22:39.600
There are histories upon histories of examples of this going on.

22:39.600 --> 22:44.920
This is even nitpicking on little things like remember how, how was, how was our weight

22:44.920 --> 22:52.400
as an effective podcast gathered using Alexa rankings, which might've been a relevant internet

22:52.400 --> 22:55.060
metric in the year 1999.

22:55.060 --> 22:58.020
And that was something that they were continuing to use in 2010.

22:58.020 --> 23:01.880
Now for those that think I'm being petty, how about, well, I can get real petty.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.920
How about the fact that the ESA could not evolve their own security, which caused people's

23:05.920 --> 23:10.780
personal information to be leaked time and time again with the show.

23:10.780 --> 23:15.360
ESA did not evolve when they needed to evolve.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.840
Therefore they are dead.

23:16.840 --> 23:23.000
That is the simple, succinct short answer to this whole situation that Jeff very plainly

23:23.000 --> 23:27.040
spelled out in that tweet, because again, Jeff is looking at this at a different angle.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.420
And again, I'm really, I'm really not trying to suck up to this guy, but it's just one

23:31.420 --> 23:33.400
of those things when it's right, it's right.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.920
And he's doing a lot of things right.

23:34.920 --> 23:40.820
As I said before on this show, before this was announced, the industry is giving Jeff

23:40.820 --> 23:45.780
the credit that they won't give the ESA because Jeff is showing how he's bringing consumers

23:45.780 --> 23:49.480
into this with what he's done with his video game award show and the other, you know, the

23:49.480 --> 23:50.600
other things that he's done.

23:50.600 --> 23:55.360
And he's going to get the industry to make announcements at summer game fest, the way

23:55.360 --> 23:57.560
the ESA couldn't do.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.960
And that's, that's just matter of fact.

23:59.960 --> 24:04.420
And so Jeff is now saying, okay, what is this event I'm going to make?

24:04.420 --> 24:10.460
And Jeff is looking at a consumer event and deciding not to go with the whole trade element

24:10.460 --> 24:11.680
and all of that stuff.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.980
We have GDC for that.

24:12.980 --> 24:17.440
We have the other Tokyo game show and other places for this, and maybe something will

24:17.440 --> 24:20.840
come along again soon, but it's not going to be E3.

24:20.840 --> 24:24.000
And so now Jeff has this whole summer game fest thing that he's building.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.280
And that's, that's what we're going to get now.

24:29.280 --> 24:34.720
Although apparently the ESA did say, they said a really weird statement because they

24:34.720 --> 24:41.080
wouldn't confirm the E3 is done, done, but they said something about, and I'm sorry if

24:41.080 --> 24:43.800
I'm butchering the exact quote, but I don't have it in front of me, but something about

24:43.800 --> 24:48.400
we look forward at bringing you E3 events in the future.

24:48.400 --> 24:54.480
Like there would be branded E3 things, which is very clearly.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.560
And I was just saying this, I'm so irritated that Bobby was on before us tonight and said

24:58.560 --> 25:01.200
this exact, well I love Bobby, but I'm irritated.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.920
He said this exact same thing is going to make it look like I stole it from him, but

25:04.920 --> 25:07.960
I was ready to come in here and say, it's because they're going to, they're going to

25:07.960 --> 25:10.240
inject E3 into PAX.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.680
Reed Pop's going to take that E3 branding and they're going to inject it right into

25:13.680 --> 25:19.240
PAX with the E3 show floor coming soon to Boston, coming soon to Seattle for the first

25:19.240 --> 25:22.440
time E3, the show floor is now E3.

25:22.440 --> 25:26.260
And quite honestly, I see it as a G4 tech TV type of situation.

25:26.260 --> 25:28.920
Why the fuck are they PAX anymore?

25:28.920 --> 25:31.560
I mean, not to be a bitch, but maybe a little bit.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.440
Does anybody care about Penny Arcade, the comic anymore?

25:34.440 --> 25:39.600
I don't think I have read the comic since we went to PAX.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.600
Sorry.

25:40.600 --> 25:45.200
And I'm sorry to the people out there that are going to feel I'm being absolute jerk

25:45.200 --> 25:49.520
with that comment, but the reality by and wide is it is not part of the pop culture

25:49.520 --> 25:54.080
internet lexicon now the way that it was, as Dark Soccer was saying in 2008 when we

25:54.080 --> 25:55.080
went.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.480
Who remembers Mega Tokyo?

25:56.480 --> 25:57.480
Yeah.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.480
Yeah.

25:58.480 --> 26:07.280
So I think next year E3 at PAX, 2025 E3, PAX turns into E3 and that's it.

26:07.280 --> 26:12.440
And finally, the show you all thought was E3 is E3.

26:12.440 --> 26:17.160
We had to go the long way to get there in the 15 year plan, but we finally got there.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.880
It's funny because I made that comment when we went to PAX that one time I said, this

26:20.880 --> 26:25.520
feels more like E3 than E3 did.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.760
And yeah, it kind of is.

26:27.760 --> 26:28.760
Yeah.

26:28.760 --> 26:29.760
And that's it.

26:29.760 --> 26:35.840
But the thing I will give Penny Arcade Expo, and I do realize this, you have a lot of board

26:35.840 --> 26:44.400
game fanatics, LAN fanatics, there are elements of PAX that E3 did not address, that PAX did

26:44.400 --> 26:49.480
very well, just being a place to go play games and be a nerd, right?

26:49.480 --> 26:53.760
There are those elements that PAX did well that E3 did not do well that I think that's

26:53.760 --> 26:58.200
the part they're going to have to consolidate a little bit because I don't think they want

26:58.200 --> 27:00.400
to take away those elements.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.040
But isn't it going to be weird when there's board games at E3?

27:04.080 --> 27:10.480
I don't know if they would do E3 at PAX because, okay, so, you know, I would assume that ESA

27:10.480 --> 27:13.120
owns the E3 branding.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.840
So why would you split off the revenue that you're making from PAX as read pop unless

27:17.840 --> 27:23.680
ESA owns read pop to give money to the ESA?

27:23.680 --> 27:25.920
I think it's the reverse.

27:25.920 --> 27:29.360
Read pop wants the E3 name to bring in more people to PAX.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.020
And that didn't seem to help them now.

27:32.020 --> 27:33.560
So I don't know.

27:33.600 --> 27:38.520
Fair point from Jason in chat, PAX isn't the Penny Arcade Expo, it's PAX.

27:38.520 --> 27:42.160
That is a good point, you know, speaking of the, you know, the relevancy.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.560
So what the hell is the name anymore?

27:44.560 --> 27:47.980
It's an archaic name.

27:47.980 --> 27:49.480
It's only tied to that con.

27:49.480 --> 27:54.560
I think if they start calling the con E3, it's going to inject new life into it.

27:54.560 --> 27:58.200
But who knows, who knows?

27:58.200 --> 28:02.360
Bobby says, I remember talking to somebody who went to E3 in 2010 after attending PAX

28:02.400 --> 28:05.960
in 08 and 09, and they were shocked E3 ended at 4 p.m.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.120
They were like, where's the 24 hour LAN?

28:09.120 --> 28:10.920
Exactly, exactly.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.240
It's not a party.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.240
Yeah.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.440
Stop being surprised, people.

28:15.440 --> 28:22.360
But all of that has to do with why E3, you know, and I think you saw even the trade,

28:22.360 --> 28:28.040
I think for years they've been retreating into game developers conference a little bit.

28:28.280 --> 28:34.160
And even the parties, by the way, for game developers conference are all work centered.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
Yeah.

28:35.160 --> 28:41.960
I mean, I went to a couple with Renee and it was a really great experience.

28:41.960 --> 28:47.560
I liked that type of thing far better than what E3 had been even when we went.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.440
There were some things I liked about E3, but there were a lot of things I didn't.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.360
Yeah, meeting people was always the best part.

28:52.360 --> 28:53.360
It really was.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.360
So.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.360
All right.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.880
We're going to move on with the show because we could talk about this topic for a very

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
long time.

28:59.880 --> 29:03.720
I feel like this is the third time we've eulogized E3.

29:03.720 --> 29:10.280
I am fairly confident, and not to get an ego, but maybe a little bit, I've gotten a lot

29:10.280 --> 29:11.960
of things right this year.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.120
And this is one I'm going to add to the list.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.280
This is the last time we're eulogizing E3.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.280
It's done.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.280
I'm done.

29:21.200 --> 29:26.120
I honestly, I don't think that anyone is surprised.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.800
It's not really news.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.800
We expected it.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.800
Yep.

29:29.800 --> 29:35.760
I do not want to utter the words E3 ever again.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.080
You're going to, I was going to say you're going to have to, but you don't have to do

29:39.080 --> 29:40.080
anything.

29:40.080 --> 29:43.120
But ReadPop is going to push that back into the conversation once they have the naming

29:43.120 --> 29:44.640
rights over that.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.720
But it won't be the same thing.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.000
I won't even call it that because it's not E3.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.800
I have to admit though, there was a morbidly curious part of me, like if they actually

29:54.800 --> 30:00.800
did have an E3 this year, part of me kind of wanted to go in the whole, like, this is

30:00.800 --> 30:01.800
so bad.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.400
I have to see it for myself kind of way.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.960
Like you wanted to go see the Ouya parking lot event.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.460
I wanted to go, I want to see, what are the big fucking NFT ideas?

30:12.460 --> 30:13.460
Let's see it.

30:13.460 --> 30:16.200
Let's just see all this shit for what it is.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.960
Let's just...

30:18.960 --> 30:24.240
He's like, it's our year to shine now.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.520
I still, I still, I can't.

30:28.520 --> 30:35.920
SSJ 100 Matt in our chat says, Jason Schreier, famous Twitter personality, I believe Bloomberg

30:35.920 --> 30:41.920
is his outlet, says, was saying that the talk at GDC was everyone asking, you going to E3?

30:41.920 --> 30:42.920
Meh.

30:42.920 --> 30:43.920
Are you going?

30:43.920 --> 30:44.920
Is it happening?

30:44.920 --> 30:45.920
Meh.

30:46.680 --> 30:53.160
As I said, there was, we were like two months out from June at this point, two months out

30:53.160 --> 30:54.520
from June.

30:54.520 --> 30:59.760
And we said like the sweet spot to get flights had passed and we didn't even know if there

30:59.760 --> 31:01.720
was going to be an E3.

31:01.720 --> 31:04.080
It was, it was already far gone.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.080
We knew this was coming.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.560
It was just a matter of when.

31:06.560 --> 31:12.880
I actually thought it would be, I did not call the timeframe of the cancellation correctly.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.200
I apologize to the internet for getting that one wrong.

31:15.200 --> 31:20.640
I thought it would be next week, but maybe because the leaks or whatever, they bumped

31:20.640 --> 31:22.200
it up.

31:22.200 --> 31:25.360
Anyway, let's move on.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.520
Let's talk about, let's talk about facts.

31:27.520 --> 31:31.160
The games that we've been playing in our gaming weeks, the types of video games that have

31:31.160 --> 31:34.280
brought joy for the most part into our weeks this week.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.480
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

31:36.480 --> 31:39.200
My gaming week was, it was all right.

31:39.200 --> 31:45.960
I played, I actually had a really, really good game of Beatlemania and we are trying

31:45.960 --> 31:48.820
to work things out to where it will be ours.

31:48.820 --> 31:53.360
So that was at my house for a lot longer.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.360
I freaking love that table.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.160
You know, it's just so much fun.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.320
It's not my favorite.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.680
That's World Cup Soccer and then Theater of Magic, but it's really fun.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.520
I love it.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.120
And then I've played of course, Marvel Midnight Suns.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.380
I played on stream last night.

32:08.380 --> 32:14.320
I have the controller that will apparently work for Star Ocean, but I was lazy and honestly

32:14.320 --> 32:16.840
Midnight Suns fit my mood a lot better.

32:16.840 --> 32:21.700
I wanted to finish the Morbius DLC and it was really good.

32:21.700 --> 32:23.980
I am, I'm, they did a great job.

32:23.980 --> 32:29.640
I just wish that some of these missions and DLCs came with more, you know.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.060
Of course I played Dead by Daylight.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.060
Oh yeah.

32:32.060 --> 32:36.580
And Strelok was in last night and I got to experience the game in a completely different

32:36.580 --> 32:40.140
way by giving descriptions of the scenery.

32:40.140 --> 32:46.340
And I was pleased to do so, but I noticed so much more dopping and taking in the scenery

32:46.340 --> 32:50.740
and then providing as accurate of a description of it as possible.

32:50.740 --> 32:54.100
Really good exercise for me also in my endeavors as a writer.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.100
Just real quick.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.100
Sorry.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.100
Loki, you have background noise coming through.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.100
Just so you know.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.100
Sorry.

32:59.100 --> 33:00.100
Sorry.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.100
Families in here.

33:01.100 --> 33:02.100
No, all good.

33:02.100 --> 33:03.100
Just mute.

33:03.100 --> 33:04.100
Text messages.

33:04.620 --> 33:12.140
At any rate, I did play Dead by Daylight.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.460
I'm stuck at Eerie 3.

33:14.460 --> 33:19.740
People are being ridiculous, but I've kind of gotten this attitude, and I must admit

33:19.740 --> 33:24.860
I was really tired playing on Monday because it kind of affected my mood.

33:24.860 --> 33:30.860
But overall I'm trying to adopt a more of a, you know what, it's a game.

33:30.860 --> 33:33.260
These people, I don't know them.

33:33.500 --> 33:38.860
I will reach out to them if I think that they were cool and say they did well.

33:38.860 --> 33:47.180
But in the end, I'm fine with just going, not caring if I talk to the assholes or not.

33:47.180 --> 33:49.060
I'll just report them and move on.

33:49.060 --> 33:53.560
They're not worth it, you know?

33:53.560 --> 34:01.660
And trying to offer some encouragement to people who are like, just crap the whole game.

34:01.660 --> 34:02.660
They're targeting me.

34:03.060 --> 34:04.060
No one's targeting you.

34:04.060 --> 34:06.020
For the record, they don't know who the fuck you are.

34:06.020 --> 34:09.420
Unless they actually follow you or something, and then they know who the fuck you are.

34:09.420 --> 34:13.540
I also started putting TTV in my name, which I don't know how I feel about it right now,

34:13.540 --> 34:16.900
but I made friends, so maybe it's good?

34:16.900 --> 34:17.900
Question mark?

34:17.900 --> 34:26.380
Anyway, I also have been playing my word game because I am addicted to it, and I started

34:26.380 --> 34:29.860
playing Marvel Snap just out of boredom.

34:29.860 --> 34:30.860
It's alright.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.860
It's not great.

34:32.060 --> 34:38.580
It's not the major, super fun thing that people have told me is it's just a fucking card game.

34:38.580 --> 34:46.140
But it's entertaining, and yeah, it's entertaining.

34:46.140 --> 34:48.900
And then it's not playing the game, but I listen.

34:48.900 --> 34:56.360
I had the Hataful Boyfriend soundtrack on earlier today when I was just working on some

34:56.360 --> 34:58.380
stuff at my desk.

34:58.380 --> 34:59.860
It's immersing yourself in the game.

35:00.860 --> 35:06.420
Well, the funny thing is I actually wasn't even playing it, not all the music is original.

35:06.420 --> 35:10.860
And then I've also been prepping some stuff for my event on my birthday.

35:10.860 --> 35:11.860
Nice.

35:11.860 --> 35:12.860
Alright.

35:12.860 --> 35:13.860
Yep.

35:13.860 --> 35:16.500
I'm gonna be older.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.980
That's how birthdays work.

35:18.980 --> 35:19.980
Every day.

35:19.980 --> 35:24.380
Unless you're Bobby Blackwolf, he's 29 every year somehow.

35:24.380 --> 35:27.100
On your birthday, you are not a year older.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.100
You're a minute older.

35:30.100 --> 35:34.580
Yeah, it's how 40 isn't that much different from 39, to be honest.

35:34.580 --> 35:37.040
You're older every day.

35:37.040 --> 35:40.380
Right now, you are older than you have ever been.

35:40.380 --> 35:43.220
You're older than you were when the show started.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.920
Go get that Geritol, grandpas.

35:45.920 --> 35:46.920
You're ready for it.

35:46.920 --> 35:51.140
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

35:51.140 --> 35:53.940
It's all Minecraft.

35:53.940 --> 35:59.500
I start off finishing up my newest episode, so I put that out on my YouTube channel.

35:59.660 --> 36:01.260
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.260
Yeah.

36:02.260 --> 36:09.900
And then also went ahead and I've been playing actually recently.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.600
So, you know, April Fools obviously was a thing.

36:12.600 --> 36:17.320
So Minecraft put out their April Fools update, which is the vote update.

36:17.320 --> 36:23.180
And so like you have with the normal game, they do these events where you vote on different

36:23.180 --> 36:24.900
features that they add to the game.

36:25.180 --> 36:30.780
Well, now you're voting on features in the game constantly.

36:30.780 --> 36:36.100
And so the rules are changing constantly as you vote for things and it gets weird and

36:36.100 --> 36:37.100
wacky.

36:37.100 --> 36:41.420
There's 380 different modifiers in the game.

36:41.420 --> 36:47.380
Like everything from like big head mode to to things that they should have added in the

36:47.380 --> 36:48.380
game.

36:48.380 --> 36:51.500
And they said they couldn't add in the game, but then they did add in the game in this

36:51.500 --> 36:52.500
update.

36:52.500 --> 36:56.620
And now they're probably not going to put in the proper game, which is like why you've

36:56.620 --> 36:57.900
developed it.

36:57.900 --> 36:58.900
You can do it.

36:58.900 --> 37:02.020
You're just now being stubborn and not doing it.

37:02.020 --> 37:03.020
So there's that.

37:03.020 --> 37:09.240
So I spun up a server last night for the updates and I'm trying to get some people to play

37:09.240 --> 37:15.500
with me to do like a one month long kind of like miniseries thing where we all the chaos

37:15.500 --> 37:16.500
in there.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.300
And it's pretty crazy right now.

37:18.300 --> 37:21.660
So I'm looking forward to that.

37:21.660 --> 37:24.740
And then working on my new modded episode.

37:24.740 --> 37:27.740
So that's coming as well.

37:27.740 --> 37:30.940
And still no word from Mo Yang about the contest.

37:30.940 --> 37:36.540
They are everybody keeps asking him about it and is taking them an unreasonable long

37:36.540 --> 37:39.860
amount of time to announce someone to evaluate.

37:39.860 --> 37:45.380
They have they have started and ended new contests in the time that they still haven't

37:45.380 --> 37:47.240
put out the results for that.

37:47.240 --> 37:51.420
So your guess is as good as mine at this point.

37:51.420 --> 37:53.260
We'll just have to wait and see.

37:53.260 --> 37:55.140
But right now, I have no idea.

37:55.140 --> 37:59.300
Oh, but I did want to mention a completely separate topic from games when saw Dungeons

37:59.300 --> 38:00.300
and Dragons today.

38:00.300 --> 38:01.300
It's fantastic.

38:01.300 --> 38:02.300
Go see it.

38:02.300 --> 38:03.300
Is it?

38:03.300 --> 38:04.300
I've heard good things.

38:04.300 --> 38:05.300
Yeah.

38:05.300 --> 38:06.300
The scene.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.300
Which scene?

38:07.300 --> 38:10.100
The the the Easter egg.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.100
Yes.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.100
I saw the Easter egg.

38:12.100 --> 38:19.180
It is a prominent a prominent part of the movie in at least it's in several parts.

38:19.180 --> 38:20.660
But yeah, there's lots of Easter eggs.

38:21.060 --> 38:24.980
I'm not really familiar with the Dungeons and Dragons lore, but obviously there's a

38:24.980 --> 38:29.180
lot of like name drops for different things like they know in the view game space like

38:29.180 --> 38:32.460
Baldur's Gate.

38:32.460 --> 38:37.340
Was it a universe is it set in or is it like multi universe?

38:37.340 --> 38:38.660
I don't know.

38:38.660 --> 38:39.660
It.

38:39.660 --> 38:40.660
Yeah.

38:40.660 --> 38:45.260
It's something to do with the Red Wizards, but I guess that's all canon and stuff.

38:45.260 --> 38:46.420
But yeah, it's really cool.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.420
Really.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.220
And there's a lot of funny moments in there.

38:49.220 --> 38:52.140
It sounds it is a great movie.

38:52.140 --> 38:53.740
I highly recommend you go see it.

38:53.740 --> 38:56.980
You know, and I was reminded I totally forgot that this was this week.

38:56.980 --> 38:58.740
The Mario movies out this week.

38:58.740 --> 38:59.740
There's a lot of people.

38:59.740 --> 39:00.740
I'm also seeing that this week.

39:00.740 --> 39:01.740
Yeah.

39:01.740 --> 39:02.740
We're going to be seeing that opening day.

39:02.740 --> 39:03.740
So very excited.

39:03.740 --> 39:04.740
I'm not.

39:04.740 --> 39:07.500
I have two other movies that I want to see and then I'll decide if I want to see the

39:07.500 --> 39:09.620
Mario movie when nobody else is seeing it.

39:09.620 --> 39:12.180
Yeah, I don't have to deal with other humans.

39:12.180 --> 39:15.300
Yeah, I don't want to deal with kids in the theater, but I might go to a late showing.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.420
I just had to find a date.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.140
Maybe Alan will take me, but I don't know.

39:19.140 --> 39:24.100
This is the person who went to see the Pokemon movie with me back in the day.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.700
That was a long time ago, but yes.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.900
You want to know what movie I saw in the theater when it came out?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.780
The Power Rangers movie.

39:31.780 --> 39:32.780
Oh, yeah.

39:32.780 --> 39:35.580
I got dragged to that too by you know who to the Power Rangers.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.660
But I say drag, but it actually was a decent movie.

39:37.660 --> 39:42.260
I thought when I was in Alabama, I was in college and I went with my friend Marcy to

39:42.260 --> 39:43.260
see it.

39:43.260 --> 39:45.380
I'm talking about the original.

39:45.380 --> 39:48.260
I was talking about the Elizabeth Banks one.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.260
Okay.

39:49.260 --> 39:50.260
Yeah.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.980
I mean, the real thing.

39:51.980 --> 39:52.980
Got it.

39:52.980 --> 39:53.980
All right.

39:53.980 --> 39:58.700
Um, let's start with the skydiving and all that.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.700
Yeah.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.020
Let's talk about my gaming week.

40:01.020 --> 40:03.580
So my gaming week, I have continued to play theater them.

40:03.580 --> 40:06.460
I streamed a little bit of that earlier in the week because there was some new DLC for

40:06.460 --> 40:07.860
Nier that came out this week.

40:07.860 --> 40:11.820
So played through that been still I'm still working on trying to play every song once

40:11.820 --> 40:12.940
I'm still not there.

40:12.940 --> 40:15.340
I'm really close, but not there yet.

40:15.340 --> 40:18.260
Actually I say really close, like 70 songs to go, but I'm going to play some more off

40:18.260 --> 40:22.340
stream probably tonight and maybe the next time I stream that game, when the next DLC

40:22.340 --> 40:27.020
comes out next week, I'll be, I'll be ready to finally get that trophy for playing every

40:27.020 --> 40:28.260
song at least once.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.580
And just knowing that I've played every song at least once been experimenting with some

40:31.580 --> 40:34.700
different builds, like to item farm and do things like that.

40:34.700 --> 40:37.140
So that's been, that's been fun.

40:37.140 --> 40:42.860
Otherwise most of my gaming week, large chunk of it has been playing a little bit of an

40:42.860 --> 40:43.860
oldie at this point.

40:43.860 --> 40:47.220
It's a little bit of backlog catch up, but not that old, it's maybe about a year old.

40:47.220 --> 40:48.620
Pokemon Legends Arceus.

40:48.620 --> 40:52.820
I've been streaming hours and hours of that and been playing a little bit off stream as

40:52.820 --> 40:53.820
well.

40:53.820 --> 40:57.740
I've now surpassed the point I was at the first time, but I'm having a lot of fun with

40:57.740 --> 40:58.740
it.

40:58.740 --> 41:03.900
Just, you know, the whole stealthy, my, my mindset approach to it is very different as

41:03.900 --> 41:06.220
opposed to feeling the need to complete the Pokedex.

41:06.220 --> 41:11.180
Like as I go, I'm just kind of catching everything, crafting everything and just kind of taking

41:11.180 --> 41:14.820
it as I want to do things and kind of taking that attitude with it.

41:14.820 --> 41:17.020
And I feel like I'm making a lot better progress.

41:17.020 --> 41:22.100
I'm actually, and apparently I just got to the third area, the coast lands.

41:22.100 --> 41:25.260
The minimum you need to get to that area is three stars.

41:25.260 --> 41:27.580
I was reading, I have four stars.

41:27.580 --> 41:33.140
So even the approach I'm taking is still allowing me to be ahead of the curve, so to speak on

41:33.140 --> 41:34.140
the game.

41:34.140 --> 41:35.140
But I'm, I'm having fun.

41:35.140 --> 41:38.660
I it's, it's a different approach to Pokemon, you know, doing like the stealth catching

41:38.660 --> 41:41.500
and all that stuff, but I'm having a good time.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.580
I got a shiny in the game randomly this week.

41:44.580 --> 41:50.220
There's actually a clip from my channel, a yellow Shinx showed up randomly out of the

41:50.220 --> 41:51.220
blue.

41:51.220 --> 41:54.260
So I actually had a little bit of shiny luck.

41:54.260 --> 41:59.180
Everybody who plays gets a shiny Ponyta because it's in one of the quests, but I actually

41:59.180 --> 42:00.300
got a shiny Shinx as well.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.680
So that was pretty exciting, even if I've seen those before, but that's all right.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.680
I like Shinx because it's very different.

42:05.680 --> 42:08.360
It's not just like it's blue, but darker.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.660
It's a very obviously different color and I think that's fun.

42:11.660 --> 42:14.680
So yeah, I'm loving Pokemon Legends Arceus.

42:14.680 --> 42:19.840
Other than those two games, I've also been playing still a lot of Diablo three, whether

42:19.840 --> 42:22.460
it's just, I've been playing the latest season.

42:22.460 --> 42:24.780
I just got my gold portrait frame tonight.

42:24.780 --> 42:29.340
It took me a little time cause I had to farm another six piece set for those that play

42:29.340 --> 42:30.340
the game.

42:30.340 --> 42:34.840
You know, you have to get these various landmarks and the, I'm playing a witch doctor this season

42:34.840 --> 42:39.780
and the free set that they give you is the new set they put in the game later on.

42:39.780 --> 42:41.980
So there is no set dungeon for it.

42:41.980 --> 42:46.780
So you can't clear the set dungeon achievement unless you farm a new set.

42:46.780 --> 42:50.660
It sounds really tedious and boring, but that's exactly what Diablo is supposed to be.

42:50.660 --> 42:53.700
Click party, do the loop again.

42:53.700 --> 42:55.860
You didn't get the loop you wanted again.

42:55.860 --> 42:58.740
You didn't get the loop you wanted again.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.740
That's Diablo.

43:00.740 --> 43:05.040
But I watch, I lurk in people's Twitch channels, like I'll watch Dark Soccer, play Midnight

43:05.040 --> 43:08.780
Suns for a little bit and then do it, do a rift and then like, okay, if somebody else

43:08.780 --> 43:13.340
on Twitch, I want to watch for a little bit, I'll channel surf and do a rift here and lurk

43:13.340 --> 43:14.340
and do that.

43:14.340 --> 43:17.120
That's, that's my Diablo playing in a nutshell.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.320
So that was my gaming week.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.160
I imagine I'll still be playing a lot of Legends Arceus this week.

43:22.160 --> 43:23.240
I do want to beat it.

43:23.240 --> 43:28.760
So I'm going to try to do most of my play on stream, but I've been doing some things

43:28.760 --> 43:33.760
off stream, like side quests and like grinding arts and crafts and things like that.

43:33.760 --> 43:37.020
Things that I, I, you know, don't necessarily need to stream.

43:37.020 --> 43:40.140
So all right, let's move on.

43:40.140 --> 43:42.920
We have some more news to get into for this week.

43:42.920 --> 43:49.040
And then we'll take your calls later on in the show over on our discord server, vognetwork.com.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.960
That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

43:51.960 --> 43:56.840
For now, let's get to our first big story tonight from Loki.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.480
Yeah.

43:58.480 --> 44:07.120
So you know, Congress is really trying to get to the bottom of important topics right

44:07.120 --> 44:08.680
now.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.680
Not gun violence.

44:09.680 --> 44:11.240
Now's not the time for that.

44:11.240 --> 44:15.440
But now we're going to talk about how Japan is being unfair.

44:15.440 --> 44:22.640
And it's just not fair that Japan and Sony you know, have like such a large market share

44:22.640 --> 44:24.400
of the Japanese audience.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.420
And it's just not fair to Microsoft.

44:26.460 --> 44:34.420
So they have interjected themselves into this whole acquisition of Activision from Microsoft

44:34.420 --> 44:43.980
by I think, sending a letter to Sony and I guess, I'm sorry to the US trade or they said

44:43.980 --> 44:51.000
this letter to Sony in regards to the attention of the imbalanced in the video game market

44:51.000 --> 44:55.860
and says which we are concerned may be a result of discriminatory trade practices that could

44:55.860 --> 45:02.780
violate the spirit of the US Japan digital trade agreement that Sony has a 90% console

45:02.780 --> 45:08.460
market share in Japan, and that makes exclusive arrangements to keep popular games from the

45:08.460 --> 45:09.920
Xbox.

45:09.920 --> 45:16.380
So kind of like a reverse Activision, I guess if you will.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.700
I wish they would just focus themselves on more important things.

45:19.700 --> 45:24.260
I mean, considering that they have literally no idea on how the internet works right now,

45:24.260 --> 45:26.980
Grandpa, I'm sorry, just doesn't understand.

45:26.980 --> 45:31.420
And I really wish that they would turn their sights to something more important than Microsoft

45:31.420 --> 45:34.420
not being as popular as Sony in Japan.

45:34.420 --> 45:37.940
I mean, it's not even the United States, like, who cares?

45:37.940 --> 45:38.940
I don't know.

45:38.940 --> 45:43.100
But they even start about how much revenue that or how much money the Japanese government

45:43.100 --> 45:48.260
puts into Sony as a major, you know, part of the economy.

45:48.260 --> 45:53.740
Well, I think the whole ordeal just goes to show that the US is not going to stop that

45:53.740 --> 45:58.460
Microsoft Activision merger, basically, a Congress person who I believe gets a lot of

45:58.460 --> 46:03.580
donations from Microsoft for the record, has basically gone on record saying, you know,

46:03.580 --> 46:10.380
I feel as an indirect response to what's going on in the UK, basically saying, why is Sony

46:10.380 --> 46:13.540
arguing all this shit when they've got all this going on in Japan?

46:13.540 --> 46:14.800
That's how it read to me.

46:14.800 --> 46:18.420
I don't think a Congress person needed to involve themselves in that.

46:18.420 --> 46:20.780
That's the part that strikes me as kind of odd.

46:20.780 --> 46:24.300
And it definitely just shows that, you know what, US ain't going to put up a fight on

46:24.300 --> 46:25.300
this merger.

46:25.300 --> 46:29.260
So the fact that it's cleared the UK, I would say at this point was the biggest hurdle.

46:29.260 --> 46:35.120
I realize Congress is not the body that does this, but it's still showing a temperature

46:35.120 --> 46:38.980
check of what Washington DC is thinking.

46:38.980 --> 46:44.120
I don't see how this doesn't pass muster at this point in the US and this merger goes

46:44.120 --> 46:48.620
through because if it doesn't, then Congress is going to be like WTF.

46:48.620 --> 46:54.580
I mean, they're busy right now trying to ban TikTok anyways, so it's like, I don't

46:54.580 --> 46:57.220
get me started on that either.

46:57.220 --> 46:59.780
No, it's the whole thing is stupid.

46:59.780 --> 47:03.420
Once again, you hear the line of questioning and like anything that when we talk about

47:03.420 --> 47:08.220
like Facebook and the security leads with that and everything, and this, their lack

47:08.220 --> 47:12.700
of understanding of how social media works and how the internet works or anything works,

47:12.700 --> 47:13.700
really.

47:13.700 --> 47:18.980
It's just like these people are making decisions based off of being stupid and then someone

47:18.980 --> 47:23.620
tells them, well, this is how it works without knowing anything or just listening to them

47:23.620 --> 47:24.620
blindly.

47:24.620 --> 47:29.540
And it's like, okay, then they make sweeping decisions based on like these false narratives

47:29.540 --> 47:34.180
and stuff that because they're just not informed because they're super old.

47:34.180 --> 47:35.180
They're old.

47:35.180 --> 47:38.820
The computer, the internet didn't exist when they were like our age.

47:38.820 --> 47:41.140
They are super old and they need to leave.

47:41.140 --> 47:44.580
But unfortunately they have to make decisions now about that stuff.

47:44.580 --> 47:45.580
Oh God.

47:45.580 --> 47:51.540
And when AI comes around, well, straight up on Star Trek, is this like, you know, like,

47:51.540 --> 47:52.540
I don't know.

47:52.540 --> 47:53.540
I can't think.

47:53.540 --> 47:54.540
Is this like Tron?

47:54.540 --> 47:55.540
Is this Tron?

47:55.540 --> 47:56.540
Are we running into a Tron situation?

47:56.540 --> 47:57.540
No, no, no.

47:57.540 --> 47:59.420
For the generation in Congress.

47:59.420 --> 48:01.620
Is this like 2001 A Space Odyssey?

48:01.620 --> 48:03.940
That's 2001 A Space Odyssey, yeah.

48:03.940 --> 48:07.340
Like here's, it's, yeah, it's awful.

48:07.340 --> 48:09.660
Here's, here's, here's the thing.

48:09.660 --> 48:13.900
I trust TikTok with my data more than I do Twitter at this point.

48:13.900 --> 48:15.560
Now here, here I go.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.700
Here come my soapbox.

48:16.700 --> 48:17.700
Here it is.

48:17.700 --> 48:23.100
But I'm just going to say the person in charge of Twitter that has no right to be there,

48:23.100 --> 48:30.460
but had the bank account big enough to do it has shown a willingness to post in private

48:30.460 --> 48:39.300
employee conversations to advance whatever his stupid agenda is over on that site.

48:39.300 --> 48:43.080
At least I don't see the CEO of TikTok doing that.

48:43.080 --> 48:48.540
So I, the whole thing is, the argument is invalid as far as I'm concerned when Twitter

48:48.540 --> 48:52.340
is not being dragged through the mud, just to the same extent that TikTok is.

48:52.340 --> 48:56.540
Well, that was the point, like when they met in Cong-, or had like the thing in Congress,

48:56.540 --> 49:02.460
like that was the first point they brought up was like, you first off, like, you know,

49:02.460 --> 49:05.180
they're saying the Chinese government doesn't have access to this stuff anyways.

49:05.180 --> 49:08.540
They were like, but that aside, like, what about Facebook?

49:08.540 --> 49:09.900
What about like Twitter?

49:09.900 --> 49:13.540
Like what about all these companies that have the same issues and like Facebook has been

49:13.540 --> 49:16.580
caught several times selling that information?

49:16.580 --> 49:19.660
Like it's not just like, we assume that this is happening.

49:19.660 --> 49:21.540
It's like, it's demonstrably happening.

49:21.540 --> 49:28.320
I mean, they've been caught numerous times, like, like, why, why are you holding TikTok

49:28.320 --> 49:30.180
to a different regard than everything else?

49:30.180 --> 49:34.420
It's because you think it's a Chinese spy app, which I mean, yeah, they may have access

49:34.420 --> 49:35.420
to it.

49:35.420 --> 49:38.020
But like, what are they really going to do with like, oh, yeah.

49:38.020 --> 49:40.860
It's information they could get other ways.

49:40.860 --> 49:41.900
Like, yeah, I don't know.

49:41.900 --> 49:42.900
It's just so stupid.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.300
But like, I don't understand what the point is.

49:45.300 --> 49:49.980
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says, from an IT point of view, TikTok should not be on government

49:49.980 --> 49:51.060
and corporate phones.

49:51.060 --> 49:52.060
And that's it.

49:52.060 --> 49:53.060
I agree.

49:53.060 --> 49:54.280
I actually agree with that.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.020
And Facebook shouldn't be there either.

49:56.020 --> 49:58.220
And neither should Twitter.

49:58.220 --> 50:01.500
None of them should be on government or corporate phones.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.500
That I will agree with.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.500
Yeah.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.500
Yeah.

50:04.500 --> 50:09.300
I mean, but there's way too many companies out there, including the one where I work,

50:09.300 --> 50:17.500
where they provide, I guess, links to corporate services through your personal phone.

50:17.500 --> 50:20.620
And they can't tell people what to put on their personal phone.

50:20.620 --> 50:21.620
Yeah.

50:21.620 --> 50:27.960
So that's kind of a fine line if, if they don't want this to be on a phone that somebody

50:27.960 --> 50:31.420
who is working in this facility is using, they need to give them their own business

50:31.420 --> 50:32.420
phone.

50:32.420 --> 50:33.420
Period.

50:34.340 --> 50:35.900
That has data, right.

50:35.900 --> 50:42.280
That has, uh, uh, management, uh, a management profile on it that would prevent from installing

50:42.280 --> 50:48.220
social media applications, but companies aren't going to give everybody their own phone.

50:48.220 --> 50:50.700
The government's not going to give everybody their own phone.

50:50.700 --> 50:51.700
That's yeah.

50:51.700 --> 50:52.700
Yeah.

50:52.700 --> 50:56.380
And that's what they, they have like, at least I know for our company, they have something

50:56.380 --> 51:02.760
similar, like if you're using your phone for work, um, which I like, I used to check stuff

51:02.800 --> 51:06.560
through work, but like now that they've locked it down, like, no, I'm not going to go through

51:06.560 --> 51:10.320
the whole process, but it's basically, you would have to set up a separate login, which

51:10.320 --> 51:12.680
basically then locks everything down.

51:12.680 --> 51:17.920
So it's like, there's a separation between your work data and your, you know, public

51:17.920 --> 51:20.520
data, I guess there's like a wall there.

51:20.520 --> 51:24.520
And when you're in your work data and all that stuff, then it's locking all of that

51:24.520 --> 51:25.520
stuff down.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.920
They're monitoring what you're doing, that type of stuff like that.

51:27.920 --> 51:32.200
But it, you'd have to be in on that secure login in order to do that.

51:32.200 --> 51:33.840
And I'm just like, that's too much trouble.

51:33.840 --> 51:36.300
Plus I don't want people contacting me when I'm not working.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.840
So I'm not doing that.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.840
Yeah.

51:38.840 --> 51:40.840
I don't use my work phone for anything but texts and emails.

51:40.840 --> 51:45.720
The, I would say the most personal thing I've ever used my work for work phone for the occasional,

51:45.720 --> 51:49.720
and I mean, occasional Apple news headline that pops up on my phone, cause it's an iPhone

51:49.720 --> 51:51.320
that grabs my attention.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.320
That's it.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.320
No.

51:53.320 --> 51:57.320
Um, I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll be perfectly honest.

51:57.320 --> 52:04.880
Um, I don't let any, I will not put anything work-related on anything personal that I don't

52:04.880 --> 52:05.880
blame you.

52:05.880 --> 52:06.880
I don't blame you.

52:06.880 --> 52:13.680
I must have that defining line or else like people who do do this stuff all the time.

52:13.680 --> 52:16.160
No, that's unhealthy.

52:16.160 --> 52:18.520
When you're at home, be at home.

52:18.520 --> 52:19.520
Shit.

52:19.520 --> 52:20.520
Um, real quick.

52:20.520 --> 52:21.520
Uh, one more comment on this.

52:21.520 --> 52:22.520
I want to get to the next story.

52:22.520 --> 52:26.160
DJ Romas says the difference is that TikTok is originally a Chinese company and that's

52:26.160 --> 52:27.160
the issue they're having.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.200
Oh, absolutely.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.200
But guess what?

52:29.200 --> 52:32.440
And this is true of every, any Congress person as well.

52:32.440 --> 52:34.600
All the phones in your pocket were made in China.

52:34.600 --> 52:35.600
All of them.

52:35.600 --> 52:36.600
It doesn't matter what brand.

52:36.600 --> 52:37.960
I don't care if you're an iPhone.

52:37.960 --> 52:41.260
They have some component at least that was made in China.

52:41.260 --> 52:44.960
The device you're using to listen to this podcast, watch this show had a, it's part

52:44.960 --> 52:47.720
of it was made in China, some part of it.

52:47.720 --> 52:53.180
So this whole TikTok thing just screams out of touch, but anyway, but as far as government

52:53.180 --> 52:54.180
phones go, fine.

52:54.180 --> 52:55.180
Yes.

52:55.180 --> 52:56.180
All social media should be banned on government phones.

52:56.180 --> 52:57.180
Yes.

52:57.180 --> 52:58.180
I would agree with that.

52:58.180 --> 53:03.020
Anyway, moving on, let's talk about other unpopular changes that have nothing to do

53:03.020 --> 53:07.100
with the government, but I, some people are wondering if this one ends up with the government

53:07.100 --> 53:09.860
and let me tell you, that would be, I don't think it does.

53:09.860 --> 53:11.220
That would be the day though.

53:11.220 --> 53:12.900
Um, Pokemon go.

53:12.900 --> 53:13.900
Yes.

53:13.900 --> 53:14.900
It's still going.

53:14.900 --> 53:20.020
Um, I know in 2016 that was, that was the year, the year before the simulation started

53:20.020 --> 53:23.600
the summer of 2016 boy, those were the days.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.440
Those days are long gone, but Pokemon go has still been going.

53:26.440 --> 53:32.640
In fact, Pokemon go made several changes to the game in response to COVID lockdowns.

53:32.640 --> 53:36.880
And now Niantic wants to undo some of those changes.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.700
It's not popular with the community.

53:38.700 --> 53:40.000
Go figure.

53:40.000 --> 53:46.760
So this week that they announced that a remote raid passes and remote raids would be changing.

53:46.760 --> 53:51.360
The price of the remote raid pass three pack would be increasing from 300.

53:51.360 --> 53:59.840
That's about $3 to 525 pokey coins, about 500 or $525, $5 and 25 cents.

53:59.840 --> 54:08.080
The price of a single remote raid pass will jump from 100 to 195, almost $2.

54:08.080 --> 54:13.740
Trainers will be able to participate in a maximum of five remote raids per day.

54:13.740 --> 54:17.080
And this maximum may change and increase for special events.

54:17.080 --> 54:20.660
They are saying though, remote raid passes will be included in the pool of potential

54:20.660 --> 54:22.620
rewards for research breakthroughs.

54:22.620 --> 54:23.620
That's kind of nice.

54:23.620 --> 54:24.620
Cause I don't buy those things anymore.

54:24.620 --> 54:27.220
I'm going to come back to that in a minute.

54:27.220 --> 54:30.760
But they are still subject to the limit of, you can only have three of them in inventory

54:30.760 --> 54:31.760
at a time.

54:31.760 --> 54:37.420
Anyway, long story short, people are pissed about this news.

54:37.420 --> 54:44.580
So far as you know, I don't want to play the game outside due to a limitation I may have

54:44.580 --> 54:45.580
or whatever it is.

54:45.580 --> 54:47.860
I got used to these changes.

54:47.860 --> 54:50.500
I'm pissed off about these changes.

54:50.500 --> 55:00.680
From where I'm sitting, Niantic made a classic, classic blunder that blows my mind that they

55:00.680 --> 55:06.740
are aloof enough to still do, because they've gone through this before.

55:06.740 --> 55:11.580
Remember when they changed the range of a pokey stop from 80 meters back down to 40

55:11.580 --> 55:12.580
meters?

55:12.580 --> 55:14.620
And they ended up having to reverse course on that by the way, because the community

55:14.620 --> 55:17.660
got pissed.

55:17.660 --> 55:23.340
The same thing then that's happening now, you announced the bad news without announcing

55:23.340 --> 55:25.540
any good news to go with it.

55:25.540 --> 55:32.200
And I'm sorry, maybe you'll get a remote raid pass and your research pack is not good news.

55:32.200 --> 55:36.540
And they linked in that announcement article to an article that talks about, we have exciting

55:36.540 --> 55:40.620
changes coming for the game and we're going to have all these events that will get excited

55:40.620 --> 55:43.180
to get people back in person.

55:43.180 --> 55:51.660
What a bunch of fucking bullshit fluff, hot air up my butthole statement was that?

55:51.660 --> 55:53.660
Literally nothing tangible.

55:53.660 --> 55:54.660
Nothing.

55:54.660 --> 55:57.820
Tell us how you really feel.

55:57.820 --> 55:58.820
How I really feel?

55:58.820 --> 56:05.620
I have never seen in my life, I have been covering video games for 21 years.

56:05.620 --> 56:13.860
I have never seen such a load of hot air up our fucking asshole than Niantic putting

56:13.860 --> 56:20.380
out that statement of, here's the good stuff that's going to offset the bad stuff.

56:20.380 --> 56:22.340
What the fuck was that?

56:22.340 --> 56:24.420
Do you not have a PR department?

56:24.420 --> 56:29.820
I know Twitter doesn't have a PR department, but last I checked Niantic is not auto responding

56:29.820 --> 56:31.580
to things with the poop emoji.

56:31.580 --> 56:36.340
There are people actually thinking at Niantic, but when they put this release out, I don't

56:36.340 --> 56:38.300
think anybody was thinking.

56:38.300 --> 56:40.220
Did they have the week off?

56:40.220 --> 56:44.780
What the fuck were you thinking?

56:44.780 --> 56:49.980
I'm assuming emergency meetings were happening this weekend after the large way that this

56:49.980 --> 56:55.940
went over in the community, like diarrhea at a library where the ventilation is broken.

56:55.940 --> 57:00.060
That's about how well this news went over when they announced this, because there was

57:00.060 --> 57:03.420
no good news to offset the bad news.

57:03.420 --> 57:12.860
I just don't know why they need consultants to consult people who actually have a pulse.

57:12.860 --> 57:15.260
There is a sick part of me that loves Niantic.

57:15.260 --> 57:16.980
I still do.

57:16.980 --> 57:22.660
And again, not to use the example I've been using for 20 years, but here I go, Tyra Banks,

57:22.660 --> 57:23.660
we were rooting for you.

57:23.660 --> 57:25.080
We were all rooting for you.

57:25.080 --> 57:29.120
There is very much that coming into play with what I'm saying about Niantic right now, because

57:29.120 --> 57:33.680
I've loved Niantic from before Pokemon Go, because I'm an old school Ingress player.

57:33.680 --> 57:36.560
Yes, I'm one of those irritating people in the Pokemon Go community.

57:36.560 --> 57:41.880
I was playing Ingress, Pokemon Go, hell, I really try to give all of the AR games a break,

57:41.880 --> 57:43.480
but I'm going to be real honest.

57:43.480 --> 57:48.040
Niantic, this decision and a lot of other things going on at Niantic feel really drunk

57:48.040 --> 57:58.640
with power, and this is not a good look, because let me tell you, NBA All World sucks.

57:58.640 --> 58:02.360
NBA All World sucks.

58:02.360 --> 58:07.640
I don't know who the fuck thought it would be a very enticing game to go out into the

58:07.640 --> 58:13.480
world to play a shoddy 1v1 game when standing at a basketball court.

58:13.480 --> 58:18.460
I don't know who the fuck thought that was a good idea, but they were very wrong.

58:18.460 --> 58:26.580
And if that's what the future of Niantic games looks like, they're in some deep fucking trouble.

58:26.580 --> 58:32.460
And Niantic is going to get bought by another company if they continue to make stupid decisions

58:32.460 --> 58:37.300
like this one.

58:37.300 --> 58:45.900
Learn something from this, because I honestly feel like Niantic never does.

58:45.900 --> 58:50.880
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I honestly think Niantic was okay with rural and disabled people

58:50.880 --> 58:54.800
not playing their game, as the people who are walking around and playing the game as

58:54.800 --> 58:58.760
originally intended are the ones that give a data set of value.

58:58.760 --> 59:11.120
I believe Niantic believes that if a disabled person can't play the game, that is not a

59:11.120 --> 59:15.760
fault of Niantic, but a fault of the world for not being accessible.

59:15.760 --> 59:21.040
I will say this, and I am willing to go on record saying this.

59:21.040 --> 59:30.040
I would be very curious how many non differently-abled people out there are latching on to the disabled

59:30.040 --> 59:33.120
conversation just to dunk on Niantic.

59:33.120 --> 59:38.560
Because again, from my Ingress experience, one of the most hardcore players in this area

59:38.560 --> 59:43.040
that is very good at Ingress where you have to go to different locations and throws very

59:43.040 --> 59:48.840
good field, she uses a scooter 95% of the time.

59:48.840 --> 59:51.200
That doesn't stop her from being a beast in Ingress.

59:51.200 --> 59:55.680
Rob, I still don't think that that's going to be a very good example.

59:55.680 --> 59:59.360
There are people who cannot afford a mobility scooter.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:05.120
There are people who are on- I did not say I'm not aware of any of that.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:10.480
I'm just saying, I think there's a lot of people who are latching on to this argument

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:14.160
for the wrong reasons.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:19.760
I think it's about, I don't want to pay $2 as opposed to $1.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:27.280
Anyway, let's see, VXJ6V in chat says, getting bought by another company isn't a punishment.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:31.340
Not to some, but I just see that's the road Niantic's headed down.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:33.840
Because NBA All-World, as far as I'm concerned, is a flop.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.600
I'm not hearing about anybody playing it.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.380
It's not in the press.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.680
It's an absolute flop.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.120
It should be everywhere when we're in the NBA finals right now and all that.

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:47.000
ParaDot comes out in a couple of months and I don't think anyone's going to care.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
What?

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Exactly.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
What was it?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:57.280
ParaDot, their original monster type of game is coming out.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.080
I think Niantic at this point is also leaning in a lot to selling their tech to other companies.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.680
That part is smart.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:09.600
That part is smart and it will probably be ultimately what keeps Niantic afloat because

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.640
a lot of these game decisions are just not great for the company.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:24.120
Anyway, let's see, SD100Matt says, Edwove Niantic said, I'm paraphrasing to some degree,

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.340
it's not about the taking the shortcut to reach the goal, it's about the journey to

01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:29.660
reach that goal.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:34.420
So it's about many of us rural players driving 30 minutes to go to raids to only maybe get

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:36.760
two to three people and not win.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.280
If Niantic was going to do this, then that should have been coupled with, here is what

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.920
we're adding to the game so that when you go to a raid, you have the people to do it

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.960
or you can find the people to do the raid, which I guess they're leaning into campfire

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.040
to some of that, but campfire isn't even available worldwide still.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.400
So there's a lot of that that just, it doesn't work.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:05.600
So anyway, SD100Matt says, Niantic isn't getting any of my money anymore, not for their stale

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.040
community days, Go Fest and other stale events because they do not focus on innovating.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.160
And Niantic has the ability to generate events.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.000
If they wanted to generate events, they have a map on their website, community.day, that

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.160
shows all of the hotbeds around the world, all of the parks, and I would bet they could

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.040
run a script to see, do they have a location within 50 miles of anyone?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.760
And there might be some places they would need to get additional coverage, but I would

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:39.560
bet the majority of America probably has one of these places within 50 miles of them.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:42.840
If not, that's something Niantic can work on by looking at the hotbeds where people

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.880
are playing.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.620
Why do they have to run a Pokemon day only in Vegas?

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.600
Why can't they run an event worldwide?

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:57.040
And if they want people to gather at a certain spot, an accessible place that anybody can

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:04.520
get around at, like the Capitol Park is one of the ones here, then you could do the event

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:05.520
there.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:12.120
And that would encourage, give people incentive and a more reason to gather in person.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.880
Don't take away a reason to play the game the way people have been playing.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.460
That's what it boils down to at the end of the day.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.040
And I think it's an ill-advised decision, obviously.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:25.040
So anyway.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.400
I'm still justifying deleting it off of my phone two years ago, so.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:34.600
Oh yeah, and there's a lot of people that are doing it now.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:40.700
But to those people, specifically the ones deleting it over this, I'm going to ask a

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.360
very tough question.

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:52.120
When Niantic releases Arceus or a new shiny or that new must-have Pokemon, when they release

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.940
that, are you going to be willing to keep that game off your phone?

01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:00.080
Because that's the only way the message is going to be received.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.920
So I hope you all stick to it.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.200
Just forget it exists, and then it's great.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.240
Every time someone brings up Niantic or Pokemon, like, oh yeah, that's still a thing, and then

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.460
I promptly forget about it again.

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.120
And I'm going to say this to the other side.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120
I do have good things to say about Niantic.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.500
I wouldn't have some of the closest friends I have if it wasn't for Ingress.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.740
I've met people through Ingress that I legitimately hang out with outside of the context of the

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.620
game because I just like them as people.

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.060
There's been a lot of good stuff there, and I understand.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.540
I understand why Niantic wants to replicate that experience.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.180
They're just going about it the wrong way.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.180
That's what it is.

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:40.660
And as far as Pikmin goes, I credit Pikmin.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.980
I do, in large part.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:46.260
I credit myself, and I credit a lot of things that I did, but I credit Pikmin in large part

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:53.140
for being the incentive for why I lost 50 pounds when I needed to last year.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.380
Pikmin was a huge incentive in that.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:05:01.300
Honestly, I give the credit 100% to you and just that you found tools to make it happen.

01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.340
Well thank you, yes, but I will say Pikmin was a tool for me.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:11.180
It was a game to play, a goal line to keep going for that I kept being motivated to leave

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.500
the house and go for when, you know.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.580
These are my motivations.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:20.540
My Apple Watch and my Bullet Journal, because I like fitting in those goals that say that

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.460
I did what I set out to do.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.380
The fitness watches are really good for that type of stuff, too.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.380
They are.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.180
But anyway, all right.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.860
We could probably spend a three-hour show just talking about those changes, but we're

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.820
going to move on to some other headlines.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.620
Let's move on to this next headline, Dark Sakura.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:43.900
All right, well speaking of, you know, we're actually going to not even speak of Pokemon

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:48.420
anymore for a minute and go on to another fun little game called Vampire Survivors.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.260
We love this game, right?

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:52.340
Yeah, I love Vampire Survivors.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:06:01.700
But anyway, it actually beat out God of War Ragnarok for Best Game Award at the BAFTA

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:02.180
Awards.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:09.300
And while God of War Ragnarok was the most nominated game, this one took the game of

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:09.620
the year.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.740
I think it's awesome.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:16.420
And it won not just Best Game, but Best Design as well.

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.660
Elden Ring and Tunic were also multi-award winners.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:27.780
But I mean, the fact that this beat out, you know, Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok and

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.660
all of these others, it's pretty amazing, I think.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:36.420
Only the greatest minds know to put Vampire Survivors as their game of the year.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.140
I saw them play that game.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.100
I really need to.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:40.580
You do.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.140
You really do.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:47.380
Yoshida Shuhei was also given a BAFTA fellowship.

01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:48.820
Sorry, fellowship.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.140
That's the Corsoni executive.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:57.540
And it's the highest, you know, award or accolade that can be given by the Academy.

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:02.740
And others who have received it are Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, David Attenborough,

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.860
Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, and Martin Scorsese.

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:11.780
You know, other people who received it have been Miyamoto, who was actually the first

01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:20.740
Asian citizen to get the award, Kojima, Molyneux, Bushnell, Newell, Carmack, lots of big names,

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:21.460
lots of people.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:28.100
But the top British game to win the award this year was Rollerdrome, which I haven't

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:37.620
played, you know, lots of really good just voice acting credits, you know, different

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.180
people.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:45.700
I think that it's fantastic who has been, what games and who has been honored in this

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.020
one.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:48.020
So I'm quite pleased.

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.620
You know what the best evolving game has been?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:51.940
Final Fantasy XIV.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.180
I would figure that or No Man's Sky, honestly.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.300
There we go.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:07:59.800
Nice.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.460
Well, thank you for the update from the Baftas and what's happening overseas.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:05.700
Let's move on.

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.200
Loki.

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:07.780
All right.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:14.500
So we've got word that the PlayStation VR2 headsets aren't selling as many units as they

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:15.700
probably would have liked.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.420
So right now it's projected that they've sold less than 300,000 units in the first month

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:23.860
saying, and because of that, critics are saying that maybe they should have dropped the price

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.700
or added backwards compatibility.

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:30.900
I think it's also too hard to tell right now because overall, I think AR and VR headsets

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:31.540
are down.

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:37.460
It looks like about 40% over a six month period, which was ending in 2023.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.940
So I don't know, give it time.

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:43.940
But yes, I do think it's expensive.

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.180
Also launch games, not a lot.

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:51.460
You know, their system seller that they wanted to like kind of put out there for Horizon.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.860
Um, not as good as they would have liked it to have been.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.620
Resident Evil 4 probably will help when that comes out.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:02.740
You know, I think that's actually already out now, but that'll help.

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:08.580
But I think they need something that is a system seller because honestly, like for me,

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:14.900
like if I wanted to get into something like that to play just that wonderful on rails

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:20.020
coaster shooter game, I am not dropping over $1,000 to do that.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.180
So it doesn't make any sense.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.460
It's just such a barrier to entry to get into that.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.940
So I think the cost needs to come down significantly to get new adopters in.

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.980
And then on top of that, you know, backwards compatibility, which is just not going to

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:38.740
happen, would at least incentivize people to purchase it that may have a PlayStation

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.900
VR one to, you know, bring over their library.

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:46.580
But since they can't do that, well, so I guess you just have to play on PC.

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:51.300
Grant and we've gone over this before that the changes in tech are what's making that

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:51.860
difficult.

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:58.340
I'll give Sony a certain amount of credit for that is that, you know, the tech changes

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:03.620
are what's and that's why games like No Man's Sky are re-releasing on VR too, because

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.900
they have to basically, you know, be updated for the new tech.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.180
That part I get.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:12.500
But it's exactly what you said when it comes to the launch titles just aren't there,

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.820
especially for a one thousand dollar entry.

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:21.300
If you don't have a PlayStation five already, there's not one game is not enough or it's

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.740
got to be a hell of a game.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.420
You know, it's got to be like amazing.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.700
It's got to be Wii Sports level moving systems.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.060
It's got to be that level.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.820
Like they don't have enough of that.

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.500
It looks good.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.140
Like the Horizon game looks good.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:40.740
Like it's a very nice looking game, but it doesn't play like a Horizon game.

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:43.940
It's not like a brand like that level of gameplay.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.300
You're not like it's not a God of War or Last of Us or anything like that.

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:52.180
It's just it's it's it's a neat tech demo for what you can do.

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.220
It's basically a climbing game, which I mean, that's not what people want to play.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.460
They want to play a full fledged game.

01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:05.460
Like if it was like Grand Theft Auto five VR and it was the full game and I could play

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:06.180
it in VR.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:09.460
Yeah, I mean, that could probably sell some systems.

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:14.820
I respectfully I kind of think Grand Theft Auto five is super old news at this point.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:19.140
And I think maybe a new Grand Theft Auto game that is made for VR rather than to just shoe

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:23.140
horning an old game into VR, I think would be a better approach.

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:28.100
We'll just have to wait for the the the meta group to to port over San Andreas, because

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.860
remember, that was their announcement that they're bringing San Andreas over to that.

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.740
So you want to talk about old game shoehorn to the VR.

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:38.980
That's a pretty old game, the shoehorn into VR.

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:44.900
But I mean, yeah, like I understand that, like, you know, a new game for sure.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:50.020
But Grand Theft Auto five, like we already have a, you know, first person mode in that

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:54.820
it wouldn't be too difficult, I would think, to be able to port in VR controls.

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.620
In fact, there are mods out there for PC that you can do that.

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:01.540
I just think something like that would be an easy win.

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:05.300
But yeah, until you get something that like people really need to buy and remember, you're

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:07.380
just you're trying to get people to buy something.

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.980
Not only to play PlayStation five, they don't own one already, but now you have to buy

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:15.540
another piece of kit that's just as expensive as a PlayStation five.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:20.660
That's a lot to ask in a recession, since we're going to use it as excuse there.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:26.580
It's just I don't know, it's a hard sell, especially also people are waiting for like,

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:31.060
you know, the meta quest three to see what that's all about and what the price point

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.380
is, because the price point is most definitely probably going to be less.

01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.780
And it's just it's easier.

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:39.940
I only have to buy that and then I can buy software for it and then I'm good to go.

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:43.140
Like, so it's a hard sell.

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.420
Let me get some comments to chat over at twitch.tv social network.

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:51.220
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, tech analysts will always say not enough sales drop the

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:51.860
price.

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:55.300
What they don't know is that even if Sony dropped the price, there isn't going to be

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.580
that demand unless you have that must have PSVR two game.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:02.980
And Shane says, Shad Leland says, I think the PSVR two is great.

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:03.940
I know he has one.

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.700
I love mine for what I've played on it.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:09.060
However, I've only used it three times since I got it.

01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:13.140
Too many good games that keep coming out that push it farther down my list of things to

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:13.460
play.

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.460
Fixie said something that led to a brain spark on my end.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:22.900
I want to get to this fixation gaze and chat says, I would love to see Pokemon in VR or

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:24.100
Legend of Zelda.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.020
And Jamie, you're in chat too.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:30.180
And I quite frankly, I was I was taken aback by this comment.

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:34.740
You said in a good way, you said Breath of the Wild would be the thing that would drag

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.620
me into VR.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:41.620
Yeah, because I just want to walk around, you know, and I think, well, you know, the

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:44.740
VR stuff gives me like a pretty bad, bad headache.

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:52.260
Um, but I mean, I want an official Breath of the Wild in VR, not a fan project.

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.100
Yeah, in Labo.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.580
But you're really a thing on Switch.

01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.060
Okay, okay, okay.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.980
So I want like a real VR experience, not Labo.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.060
Okay, but here's here's the thing.

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.860
So we're all waiting for the Switch successor, right?

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:15.460
What if the Switch successor now I and I don't know how much I expect Nintendo to jump into

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.220
this, but I'm going to throw it out there.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:22.180
What if the whole thing with the Switch successor is it's the Switch, but it's the Switch 3.

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:27.140
And the reason why they call it the Switch 3 and not the Switch 2 is that it's handheld,

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.620
TV, and VR.

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:35.540
Because do a thing with that screen, very similar to how Labo was all set up, but this

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.060
time the device is built for it.

01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.660
And the third Switch, so you could, it switches three ways.

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:44.740
It's a three-way device.

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:49.140
I know it's, I, at the end of the day, I'm not sure I see Nintendo getting into this

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:54.420
market at all, but it's a very interesting sort of, that's something they could do to

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.660
the Switch to make it switchier.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.700
It would be horrible is what it would be.

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:05.780
It would be absolutely horrible because one, you can't, you cannot put that much power

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.340
into a handheld device like that right now.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:15.220
Two, the screen resolution that they're running on that is 720p, which I've played Labo VR.

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.260
It's awful.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:18.180
It's not good looking.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.060
It's cool.

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.580
It's a cool concept.

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:21.860
It just does not work.

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:28.740
Loki, that's all you need because the Switch wasn't designed to do this, but even the

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:33.860
fact that you said it's cool, it just wasn't designed to do it, could be fixed.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:39.700
Go back though, at that low of a resolution, especially for folks like me that are prone

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:43.620
to migraines, it would be a nightmare, an absolute nightmare.

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.340
You have to have quality if you're going to do a VR unit.

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:49.700
And something that technology six years later could hopefully improve on.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:54.820
If they would maybe like 30 years, they might get on board with that.

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:56.980
They're going to get on board with that when the train's already left.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:00.900
Like there is no way that they're going to do this anytime soon because they're making

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.300
hand over fist money with what they've got right now.

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.740
They're not going to like pivot until they need to pivot.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:11.140
This is why I'm not really willing to put this on the record as an official.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:14.580
I believe as somebody in chat said earlier, Rob Stradamus prediction.

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:15.460
I'm not putting it there.

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:20.980
I'm just saying, ooh, I never thought of that before today, but that's a way that the switch

01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:22.020
could get switchier.

01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.940
And that's exactly the line.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:25.780
Put it on the back of the box.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.380
The switch gets switchier.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:34.660
Now, like the new generation, this device participates in three ways way more often.

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:41.300
Well, the only way that this would take off, like you'd have to have, okay, Apple releasing

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.700
their VR headset, which are already rumors.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.300
That's going to be several thousand dollars, but people will pay the Apple tax.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.500
I know that absolutely.

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.500
So you get the wide adoption of VR with that.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.140
Then maybe they may switch to that as far as the thing.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:58.980
But right now, I think the direction they would go with that is consoles are getting

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.100
more powerful.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.740
People have seen what the steam deck can do.

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:07.460
They're just going to put out a more powerful handheld and that'll be that.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:11.060
And it'll be the same stuff over and over and over again until

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:18.340
there's a mass adoption where Microsoft and Sony are all releasing VR centric head systems.

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:19.700
They're not going to pivot to that.

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:27.140
I mean, I would like to think that they're trendsetters, but I think that ship has sailed

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:27.700
as well.

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:31.460
They were trendsetters when the Wii came out, and now they've been just kind of refining

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.420
that Wii process.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.900
And now it's just kind of a novel thing.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:40.980
Like how many games do people really actively take part in using the motion controls for

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:45.300
the Switch Sports is about it.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.260
And that's because people like the nostalgia of going back to that.

01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.660
I know my kids like playing or at least one of them likes playing the Switch Sports stuff

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.980
just because it's just fun and novel.

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.700
But like any other games, no, they're not using the motion controls because it's a handheld

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.980
system they're using as a handheld.

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:06.420
So if they're downplaying the features that they're building into this thing for one

01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.380
already.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:12.820
And also they're touting it as like a family system, a co-op same screen type of system

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:13.140
thing.

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:16.340
And I just don't see them doing that.

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.940
Yeah, they experimented with the little mini system where you can't take the Joy-Cons

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:20.580
off anymore.

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:27.060
But I just can't shake the whole.

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:31.460
You're right that the VR landscape might be changing pretty soon when certain players

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:32.340
get in the market.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:37.780
But I just can't shake that feeling of that.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.340
It does this, this and this without extra wires or any of that.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:46.100
I just that's very, it's a very appealing marketing gimmick.

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:49.540
Oh, go ahead.

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:56.180
I was just going back to thinking about Labo because that being Nintendo's attempt at VR.

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.980
They could have done so much more with it, but it didn't get the support.

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:08.500
And I'm also thinking in terms of just that, you know, there are some technologies that

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.900
the general public isn't going to be ready for.

01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:14.260
And I think VR right now is just is one of those.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:20.020
The problem with Labo is it was, it's fun to build all the things for it, but it's so

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:20.500
gimmicky.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:23.220
And then you're left with a bunch of like stuff like, what am I going to do with all

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:23.540
this?

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:24.820
I threw mine away.

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.900
Meaning the Labo VR, sorry.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.940
No, I threw mine away.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:31.220
I threw my Labo VR away because it was a ton.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.940
It was a ton of cardboard that like it took up a ton of space and there was no place to

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.420
store it.

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:40.020
They have like a little flimsy like stand you can make to like stack some of the stuff,

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.180
but like it took up so much space.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.940
And each one of those devices is used for one game within this.

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:49.700
It is it is like third party.

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:52.980
We accessory like nightmare stuff that they had.

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:56.500
And it's a it's a neat concept to get people playing games and stuff like that.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:02.660
But it's, they then pivoted that into, uh, was it a game builder garage, which nobody

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:03.460
talks about anymore.

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:06.180
It probably does anything with like, cause that's once again, that's something that's

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:07.060
not been a focus.

01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:12.740
It was a neat idea, but they didn't support it and too much beyond like just what they

01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:13.540
had out for it.

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:18.100
And they did like this weird thing with, uh, Mario Odyssey with Labo VR.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:18.900
And it was awful.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.620
It was awful to like, look at it cause the screen was so blurry.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:28.180
And I tried the one thing on yours and it made me pretty sick.

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:33.220
You know, I mean, one would have expected that Nintendo would have been better.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:40.420
I really feel like this Labo thing is getting taken too literally as what the VR that Nintendo

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.380
could produce could be.

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:43.940
I see Labo as a proof of concept and nothing more.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:44.580
And that's it.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:45.620
Concept.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.340
That's it.

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.940
Not actual execution.

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:51.300
But anyway, it's, um, I just keep an eye on time.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.700
We're very passionate tonight on all these topics.

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.380
Let's try to move through these next few stories.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:58.340
We're going to get to the classic game of, or excuse me, actually tonight we have an

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:02.020
on-game game of, or no, a non-video game tonight.

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.540
It's a non-video game game.

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.340
Non-video game game.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.500
We're going to get to that in a little bit, but first we have a few more stories including,

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.660
oh yes, April Fool's day was yesterday.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:13.620
We talked about that a little bit at the top of the show, how I think most of us are kind

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:19.300
of over April Fool's day, but occasionally there are still some hah sorts that elicit

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.740
that singular hah that come out of these sorts of things.

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:25.300
And I would say this was it from Sega.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:32.100
Sega for April, Sega for April Fool's day released a game called the murder of Sonic

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.140
the Hedgehog.

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.380
It was a free adventure game for PCs.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.900
It's actually still available on Steam.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:39.140
Yeah, on Steam.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:39.640
Great.

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:46.260
It's Amy Rose's murder mystery birthday party and Sonic dies.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.260
And so now you have to find out what happened.

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:50.260
So I guess you could say it's a visual novel.

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:54.420
So I don't know if it's like a Danganronpa type of thing or maybe a little simpler than

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:59.460
that, but you interrogate the guests and so forth and try to figure out what's going

01:21:59.460 --> 01:21:59.960
on.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:04.420
Sega has the direction of Danganronpa though.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.220
Probably not to that extreme, but I got the game.

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.580
But anyway, yeah, those, those types of things.

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:13.220
That's when April Fool's day is funny and actually cute.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.820
So I thought that was cool.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.500
Um, you know, that's how hot to full boyfriend started.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.300
Yeah.

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:19.620
Right.

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:23.380
Well online April Fool's joke and to bring things full circle.

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:28.580
Pokemon go started as the Google maps April Fool's joke about three years prior.

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:32.260
So sometimes pretty legit things come from April Fool's day.

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:35.220
There was some other silly, silly stuff like the Blizzard Diablo.

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:37.140
Twitter was announcing all this nonsense.

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:41.460
Although I don't know, it was, they were doing things like the butcher will manifest in real

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:44.420
life and come strangle or come slaughter you.

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:45.540
That was the word slaughter you.

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:49.860
And I just replied, I put slaughter me daddy because they had a picture of the butcher.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:54.020
I agree with, with Gwen Pudding.

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.700
Um, we must find the pudding.

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:04.420
Also they see sometimes the fans do somewhat amusing things on Reddit, the world of Warcraft

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:09.700
or wow Reddit and the final fantasy 14 Reddit literally swapped skins for the day.

01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:14.180
So when you went to the wow Reddit, it said final fantasy 14 and Walker, all the topics

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:17.700
and posts were still there, but it was also the mods behind the scenes.

01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:18.260
Both agree.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.140
I love that.

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:25.220
So world of Warcraft fans and Final Fantasy 14 fans coming together to achieve total internet

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.020
fuckery.

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:26.900
You love to see it.

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:33.780
I like the IGNs where they had like a video talking about those features being added by

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:34.420
Nintendo.

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.660
They did like a mock Nintendo direct where they're adding voice lines from the Mario

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:40.020
movie into like Mario games.

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:40.900
No, I hated that.

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:42.660
Silly.

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.540
Hated it.

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.500
All right, moving on Dark Sakura.

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:54.100
All right, well multiverses, um, their open beta is going to be closing on June 25th.

01:23:54.660 --> 01:24:01.620
The full launch is ready for early 2024 with some new features and new modes, but that

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.860
free to play one is going away.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:16.500
Um, I, uh, according to their FAQ, um, again, June 25th, um, and they haven't yet provided

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.580
the time, but they will closer they get to it.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:25.300
Um, and then they said that it's closing because they've got lots of feedback and they

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:30.580
have some work to do along with the net code and matchmaking and working on the progression

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:31.300
systems.

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:39.860
So they are again targeting early 2024 and it will be removed from digital storefronts

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:43.220
and unavailable for download beginning on April 4th.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.780
So Tuesday.

01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:47.300
Yeah.

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.460
If you're going to get it, now's the time.

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.460
But yeah, I'm surprised that that was in beta.

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:54.580
Like I thought that came out.

01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:56.740
I thought they were selling DLC for that and everything.

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:58.260
I think it's a convenient.

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:00.580
There's more.

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.080
Okay.

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:05.860
The season two battle pass, which is supposed to end on March 31st will be extended through

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.660
June 25th.

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:12.500
Um, and so the daily missions will keep going and the battle pass points and all of that

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:13.860
until the game is taken offline.

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:18.100
There will be no more, the weekly seasonal milestones.

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:19.620
So there you go.

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:27.620
So season two in an open beta, but one good thing is that for any content that you've

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.980
earned or purchased in game will carry over to the full version of the game.

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.340
I have a feeling a lot of this is because there's less and less people playing multiverses.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:42.180
And so they're gonna, they're Final Fantasy 14 it, they're going to take it down to fix

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:47.140
it all up and get to relaunch it again and get all the press release and stuff and get

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:50.260
another go at fixing some of the problems people have with it first time.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:51.620
I think that's exactly what this is.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.260
So I know.

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:54.740
Yep.

01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.420
But it's their decision.

01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:56.920
Yeah.

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.580
All right.

01:25:58.580 --> 01:25:59.540
Moving on Loki.

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:08.180
So Australia, um, their government wants to give 18 plus ratings to any game with simulated

01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.620
gambling in it.

01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:16.820
And that could be anything that includes like actual gambling to loot boxes.

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:22.420
So anything that actually has like a loot box or some sort of like random element to,

01:26:22.420 --> 01:26:27.620
you know, unlocking things that you pay for would be considered an M rated game.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.660
Would a stock market simulation be considered an M rated game then?

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.380
I mean, it is, it is gambling.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.300
It seems like, so yeah, I would think that that does, um, you know, this

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:41.300
Bobby Black Wolf with an excellent point with super Mario brothers three toad house, would

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:43.780
that be considered a M rated cause it's gambling.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:48.420
I think it's because you're actually, they're talking about stuff that you pay for like

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.620
with money in the game.

01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:55.380
So like if, if for example, in super Mario brothers three toad house, if they did the

01:26:55.380 --> 01:27:01.220
re-release of that game where I could buy toad coins with real money and then buy stuff

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.500
randomly toad house, then yes, that would be a mature rated game.

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:06.740
I don't like that.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:08.020
Yeah.

01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:12.180
So if, if, um, you know, they're talking about like, you know, so like, for example, like

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:17.220
Roblox or something like that, if you like pay Roblox to unlock a loot box, it's got

01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.900
random stuff in it, then that would be an M rated game.

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:27.700
Um, so, and that of course affects, you know, EA's, FIFA and Madden and all that stuff

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:28.020
too.

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:30.020
So good.

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:35.700
See, as far as like the, the loot box argument goes, it seems a little late to the party,

01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:41.460
but I mean, I still feel like there's a lot that needs to be kind of quantified in there

01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:43.140
about what does gambling really mean?

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:47.220
But I think if you're talking about the real money currency, then, then it makes a lot

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:47.780
more sense.

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:52.020
As long as they're kind of saying real money to this, I, it makes a lot more sense.

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:58.900
But now here's the thing though, is M rating in Australia doesn't necessarily mean over

01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.460
18.

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:02.100
It means, you know, 15 plus.

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:05.860
So, you know, it's recommended for people over 15.

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:07.940
So imagine like a teen rated game.

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:14.260
It won't legally keep games out of the kids' hands, but, uh, they said that the, oh, the

01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:19.220
stricter MA 15 plus legally restricts the product of over age of 15.

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:23.540
So it's not that it's going to prevent kids from buying it.

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:26.580
It's just going to be like rated higher, which parents don't read that anyway.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:32.100
So, you know, kids will still have them, but it's a start, I guess.

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:33.860
All right.

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:40.500
Well, moving on to the end of Steam on some platforms, but it's not what you think.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:43.940
Steam is going to stop supporting Windows 7 and Windows 8.

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:51.300
Next year in 2024, uh, from the 1st of January, 2024, Steam will no longer work on Windows

01:28:51.300 --> 01:29:00.260
7, 8, and nope, not even 8.1, uh, in an update that, um, I'm assuming that is already sunsetted

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.260
with XP, uh, to be quick.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:05.060
No, I want Steam on Windows 3.11 for networking.

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:10.020
Which honestly, honestly, pour one out for the old show computer we used to use up until

01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:16.020
the Twitch with the Twitch transition in 20 at the end of 2018, right?

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:18.660
December, 2018 was the Twitch transition.

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:24.260
We moved to a Mac mini to do video, but up until then 2018, I was running the show on

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:29.620
a Windows XP computer and I got shit for it all the time, but I was like, Hey, if it ain't

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:31.860
broke, I ain't fixing it.

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.820
End of story.

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:38.260
Finally, all these years later, now it's being broadcast for Windows 11.

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.740
So I'll be fine from the Steam front and all that stuff.

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:45.220
But anyway, uh, there are still people out there running Windows 7 and 8.

01:29:45.220 --> 01:29:49.060
They have not yet taken the leap to even 10, uh, or 11.

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:53.300
But, uh, that's their problem and not everybody else's.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:53.860
Yeah.

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.980
But you know, if you-

01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:58.020
Security concern, considering that they've stopped supporting it.

01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:02.660
Or maybe you want to consider a dual boot for like Linux or something that Steam is

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:03.380
supporting it on.

01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:03.780
I don't know.

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:08.340
But the point is, it ain't going to work for you as of January 1st.

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:13.940
So if you want to continue to run Steam, including any game or product through the platform,

01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:16.180
that could be a yikes for some people too.

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.340
You're going to need to update Windows.

01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:26.660
And for the five people who will be all up in arms about it, the company is not responsible

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:27.940
for you being on obsolete tech.

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:33.140
Mm-hmm, bonds 006 says Windows XP.

01:30:33.140 --> 01:30:34.900
Dan, you are a legend for that, Rob.

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:35.780
Oh, thank you.

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:37.780
Flattery will get you everywhere.

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:38.500
Thank you.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.820
Uh, DJ Rob S says, of course, unless I'm a legend in a wanted poster somewhere.

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:45.060
Uh, DJ Rob S says support has ended.

01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:48.900
Only select companies are paying for extended Windows 7 support.

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.900
And Valve clearly isn't one of them.

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:52.500
All right.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:58.340
I just think it was funny that the one time Dan thought he was going to do me a good deed

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.580
and upgrade the OS on my old PC.

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.900
Windows ME broke it.

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:05.540
All right.

01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:10.660
We are going to take a trip down memory lane for our next segment.

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:11.620
Let's get to it.

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:27.540
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:29.780
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:33.060
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:40.980
But as we know, in this twist, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game once a month each month

01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:43.140
in 20- each month of the year in 2023.

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:44.020
What did you pick tonight?

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.180
I picked the Bop-It.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:47.700
Bop-It.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:51.140
The most annoying toy in the world.

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:51.540
Pull it.

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:54.740
Oh, my mother's had one.

01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.700
I hated that thing.

01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:06.500
Anyway, Bop-It is an audio gaming toy, sort of- I'd say not unlike the Simon that I did

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.140
last month.

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:12.820
And it would give you a series of audio commands that, you know, had a little voice recorded

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:20.340
through a speaker and you would have to do those commands when it says that with it getting

01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:21.620
increasingly more difficult.

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:29.620
Which I randomly one night got really bored and found someone get the world Bop-It record

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.340
on YouTube.

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:32.500
I'm like, whatever.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.900
Like speed running Bop-It.

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:47.380
But anyway, it was a really popular thing, I think.

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:49.060
I mean, like I said, my brothers had it.

01:32:49.620 --> 01:33:00.820
And it had- there's a statement on here about people were actually using it to engage in

01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:07.700
social behavior and that there were various different versions that were released and

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:18.500
even a diagnostic mode that would tell you like what version of the little system it

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:18.740
was.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:29.940
So at any rate, it sold a bunch and there were just so many things out.

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:33.460
But we'll go ahead and start with the very beginning.

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:41.860
So 1986, the instructions were copyrighted and then the game was the first of what was

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:45.940
going to become a series of Bop-It games with, you know, the basic patent.

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.380
The original game was called Bop-It.

01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:53.780
It had three inputs, a pressable button in the center, a twist-it lever, and a pull-it

01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:54.100
lever.

01:33:56.020 --> 01:34:00.260
In three game modes, there was solo bop, vox bop, and beat bop.

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:07.700
So you would have those different means of playing and it would give you the command

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.780
and you had to do the command in the right amount of time.

01:34:12.020 --> 01:34:15.380
So, you know, you had your little twist-it crank and it made a little noise and

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:22.820
at any rate, your score comes out with a maximum value up to 100.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:28.340
There's a different model in 2000 that could score up to 200.

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:39.060
And each pull-it whistle, like at its end sequence, would denote 100 points and each

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.820
ratchet denotes 10.

01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:42.580
And then a drumbeat would do one point.

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:46.660
So if you reach 200 points, the game will play a victory song.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:53.380
And then they repeated this in later models and the Zingit spin-off.

01:34:55.220 --> 01:35:00.180
But the cipher values were used for all of the subsequent Bop-It ciphers.

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.460
The original one used three AA batteries.

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:08.500
Following that was the Bop-It Extreme, which looks like a really bizarre steering wheel.

01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:18.260
It came out in 1998, where the patent was filed with other patents as pending.

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:25.940
It had the additional commands of flick-it with a green zigzag lever and spin-it, which

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:31.460
was a wheel at the end, a red wheel, and it had four game modes.

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:40.820
So it added in beat bop, it had vox bop, beat bop, vox bop solo, and beat bop solo,

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:46.580
I can't say those words, with a maximum score increase of 250.

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:50.900
And it had like different victory songs that you would get.

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:54.340
And it also ran on three AA batteries.

01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:59.380
And as of 2003, this was actually one of the most popular games on the market.

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:07.780
Then out came a Bop-It Extreme 2, which basically had like some clear elements, but all the

01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:08.340
same shit.

01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:12.660
And it was awarded the Electronic Game of the Year in 2005 in the UK.

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:14.820
It also required three AA batteries.

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:23.300
Some of the inputs were altered, it had volume controls, and it had the scoring just put

01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.580
everything out in words.

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:34.740
And there was a German-speaking version that had the name Simon Challenge.

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:38.900
Bratz Bop-It came out, and guess what?

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:39.300
Hell yeah.

01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:42.020
It used three AAA batteries.

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:49.700
So then it was more of a layout, like the three input one had the same scoring system,

01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:50.820
all the rest of the same stuff.

01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.620
It was just a repackage.

01:36:52.260 --> 01:37:01.380
Bop-It Blast was developed by Tiger Electronics, and it had the same three input with more

01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:02.820
patents pending.

01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.380
It had an optional female voice.

01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:07.860
You could use both voices.

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:09.780
Had victory songs.

01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.460
It used three AA batteries.

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:14.020
And this high score on it was 500 points.

01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:25.540
Then Bop-It Download, which had three game modes, solo, pass it, and one-on-one with

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:28.660
15 levels of difficulty with a max score of 1,000.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:35.220
And to let you download a program to download new content, it was discontinued when Hasbro

01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:38.180
discontinued the item, the download service.

01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:44.820
And the level up sound was taken from this Bop-It to be used in later Bop-It models.

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:49.700
So the current versions on the market right now, we have Bop-It exclamation point.

01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:57.940
It has options to shout it, which makes you shout into a microphone.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:00.580
And then three difficulty levels.

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:05.540
The highest difficulty does voice sound and color commands.

01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:08.660
So, and that was the one I watched someone get, by the way.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:10.820
That was pretty, pretty intense.

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:19.860
They also added a party mode where you could use body parts like foot, hip, and arm.

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:21.300
Use three AAA batteries.

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.580
And when you turn it off, it says, I'm going to sleep.

01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:32.500
And then it had Bop-It bounce, which I don't get this one.

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:38.660
It has a ball and a handheld trampoline, I guess that you could bounce it on.

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:40.100
That one's weird.

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:47.380
But there was the Bop-It XT, which was the fourth edition of the Bop-It extreme.

01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:49.540
And it had a new command called shake it.

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:58.500
The spin is now an orange is a Bop-It smash, which had a color changing lights in the zone.

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.220
And you would smash the two Bop-It buttons together when the light was either green or blue.

01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:06.340
And it had many other things.

01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:11.860
There's Bop-It Tetris, which I had no idea.

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.060
Bop-It Tetris.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.580
I'm not, I can't even.

01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:22.100
Bop-It Beats, where you have these modes called classic, classic party, DJ, DJ party,

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:26.260
and remix with three difficulty levels, rookie, expert, and lights only.

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:30.740
You could Bop-It, spin it, scratch it, reverse it, repeat, and flip it.

01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.500
You can put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:42.900
No, sorry.

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:47.620
And then there was the Bop-It micro series that were teeny tiny little Bop-Its.

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:51.860
And the other ones that they had different branded ones too.

01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:55.940
There was Bop-It R2-D2, BB-8, Groot, and Minion.

01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.260
Because Minions are on fucking everything.

01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:00.580
There was also an Olaf and a Chewbacca.

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:06.740
And then there's one for the child, AKA Grogu.

01:40:08.260 --> 01:40:10.420
The only two names that are acceptable for the creature.

01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:16.820
And there's a Spider-Man one and all kinds of other ones.

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.140
And there's even one shaped like Darth Vader.

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:23.700
But the Darth Vader one had Emperor Palpatine saying the commands.

01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:24.820
And I don't get that either.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:30.500
So there were Bop-It New Moves, AKA Bop-It Refresh.

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:36.020
Bop-It Maker, where I guess you could design your own Bop-It stuff.

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.020
It's got different things in there.

01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.820
I'm not reading everyone.

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.660
I'm just listing all the names of them now.

01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:52.820
There was the original re-release, the classic re-release, the all kinds of modes.

01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:55.620
I mean, my goodness, this game mutates.

01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:58.580
It is not called that.

01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:01.300
It is Grogu or the child.

01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:03.460
We have never seen Yoda as an infant.

01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:04.100
The end.

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:08.100
The random video I came across on YouTube and the recommends for the ones you sent

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.660
had this guy that's got like 40 different Bop-Its.

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:13.060
I was like, there's that many that exist?

01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:14.020
My goodness.

01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:20.740
What about the one where finally it's become it's the AI has taken over and now the device bops you?

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:26.420
I saw one that was done at this weird.

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:31.060
So like I used to take my kids to this event that they had back when they're really little,

01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:36.740
like they were like babies that basically had a bunch of like cars, like fire trucks

01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:37.540
and stuff like that.

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:43.300
But they also had these vehicles that someone made for Burning Man.

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:47.300
And they had a Bop-It with flamethrowers in this big metal cage.

01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.180
They get to play it.

01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:51.940
That's the same people that made the DDR machine that shot fire at you when you got a stamp.

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:52.500
Yeah, probably.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:53.000
Yeah.

01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:55.780
But obviously it didn't shoot fire at you.

01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.620
There are the sister products.

01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:01.300
Oh, boy.

01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.860
Zingit, which is a yo-yo audio game.

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:08.500
There's Toppit, which is a Kendama style.

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:12.340
You know, the cup ball thing that you do in the cup?

01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.420
That one exists.

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:20.900
There's one called Torx, which has two twistable circles and two bendable arms that can be

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:23.220
bent in 90 degree angles.

01:42:23.220 --> 01:42:25.300
And it sounds too complicated.

01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:33.620
And then Groove-It, where very much like the Bop-It games, it uses a photo detection to

01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.620
determine where your hand position is.

01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:38.180
And it uses voice commands.

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:42.980
But now you have the scratch, the slide, the zoom, and it's more tolerant of errors because

01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:44.180
of hand things.

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:49.860
And then it's got, like, some of the other ones, as you progress through the game, it's

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:50.360
got...

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:53.140
Fixie.

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:53.700
Okay, I get it.

01:42:55.220 --> 01:42:58.260
You didn't see my reaction over here when you were talking about Toppit.

01:42:59.060 --> 01:42:59.700
I did.

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.200
I did.

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:06.020
Well, I didn't see your reaction because I was reading the thing, but yeah.

01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:07.220
Not that.

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:10.020
You know, and then the sequel, Bottom-It.

01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:16.420
They haven't yet come out with Verse-It yet because people are convinced it doesn't exist.

01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:17.540
It's 2023.

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.060
It's perfectly acceptable to cite it.

01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:27.780
At any rate, Groove-It also adds other commands like the chop, the zip, the flow, the car

01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:31.300
wash, the rock and roll, the kung fu, the swirl, and the hip hop.

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:32.980
And that is it.

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:34.580
Oh, is that all?

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:39.380
Groove is bottom-it.

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:44.340
I've learned more about a Bop-It than I ever thought I would in my entire life.

01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:49.540
But no, it's fascinating just how many of those fucking things there have been over

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:49.940
the years.

01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:50.580
That's for sure.

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:56.980
And my favorite, though, way to do Bop-It is just to smack people in the head with it

01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:00.020
when they bother me and say, no, I was just following the game.

01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.220
Like I said, Bop-You.

01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.420
Bop-It is my Bop-It.

01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.020
Get out my cane and my Geritol.

01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:11.940
We called it dodgeball.

01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:14.180
If you didn't dodge, you got bopped.

01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:16.420
I remember Lorena Bop-It.

01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.700
That was a heck of a trial.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:19.220
Oh, my God.

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:23.780
And that poor woman.

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:26.980
Also, what else was I going to say?

01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:28.740
I had another joke I was sitting on.

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:29.780
Oh, well, forget it.

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:31.940
I don't think her situation was funny, though.

01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:33.380
She was an abused woman.

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.300
Damn, I had another dad joke and it left.

01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:39.800
Oh, well.

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:42.180
Let's see.

01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:43.780
All right, there it is.

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:49.700
Bop-It, your classic not video game game of electronic not video game.

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:50.580
That's what I'm going to call it.

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:52.340
All right, of the month.

01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:58.020
I'll change the name next month, which, you know, funny enough, a lot of these things

01:44:58.020 --> 01:45:00.980
we've been talking about, you know, Simon last month, Bop-It this month, y'all have

01:45:00.980 --> 01:45:02.020
played them at some point.

01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:02.980
Jenga was one.

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:04.420
Y'all have played these things.

01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:11.380
So you can't say they don't like, you know, have some things in common with video games,

01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.700
especially, you know, in regards to the fandom and stuff.

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:17.060
But yeah, anyway, wait till you find out what next month is.

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:17.620
Oh, boy.

01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:18.420
All right.

01:45:18.420 --> 01:45:19.300
Are there two?

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:23.460
Actually, that's the part I have been finding fascinating is like the 200 different versions

01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:26.180
of Simon and the 200 different versions of Bop-It.

01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:28.340
It's like, okay, I legit did not know.

01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:32.740
That's I still don't understand Super Simon, but maybe one day I will.

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.140
Well, we never got it over here.

01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:39.140
I happened to play somebody who lived overseas.

01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:40.580
I played bears.

01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:43.220
All right, moving on.

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:47.700
Let's travel around and check out some quick news in rapid fire news.

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:48.200
Loki.

01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:49.460
Yes.

01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:53.940
So there's been an old Atari game prototype that's been discovered.

01:45:54.420 --> 01:45:59.700
So Sonar, which is almost I guess it sort of plays like Battleship.

01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:02.260
So that's pretty cool.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:08.100
So Atari Protos, they says Sonar apparently is missing some features because it's incomplete.

01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:17.460
And so some of the hiccups include flickering, which you using the Sonar scan and also has

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.900
one pre-programmed map.

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:20.500
But that's pretty cool.

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.700
Something that could have been.

01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:27.220
And the ROM itself has been posted to Atari Age if you're interested in checking it out.

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:34.580
Of course, if you have checked out Marvel's Avengers or were planning on doing it,

01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:36.420
you got news for you that they're canceling that.

01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:42.660
But in the meantime, if you have checked out Marvel Avengers, you can actually get the

01:46:42.660 --> 01:46:44.500
unlocks for the game for free.

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:49.220
They've unlocked pretty much everything for the game for free because, yes, it is being

01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:52.740
taken offline, but that's pretty cool.

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.860
So the marketplace has been mostly unlocked thanks to the update.

01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:01.220
2.8 unlocks nearly all marketplace items for free.

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:07.460
And yeah, you can go check it out before it's taken down.

01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:09.780
All right.

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:10.420
Dark Sakura.

01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.060
Samba de Amigo.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:19.060
Gosh, one of my favorite games, but Party Central is going to have some Sonic the Hedgehog

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:21.700
content, including Sonic also playing.

01:47:22.500 --> 01:47:27.860
But for some of the songs, we have Escape from the City from Sonic Adventure 2 and Fistbump

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:28.980
from Sonic Forces.

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:34.500
And then there's a stage called City Escape as in the one from Sonic Adventure 2 with

01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.900
Sonic as a playable character.

01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:41.780
Although, why couldn't they have done like Speed Highway?

01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:43.620
That would have been so much better.

01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:49.700
If anyone who doesn't know what it is, City Escape is the one that's kind of like San

01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:54.260
Francisco, like almost a crazy taxi-ish kind of level.

01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:58.260
But yeah, it's going to be out for Switch this summer.

01:47:59.220 --> 01:48:01.220
I don't see a date, but it'll be out.

01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:03.800
All right.

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:10.900
Let's check out real quick some of the freebies coming to the extended platforms on PlayStation

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:12.260
and Xbox.

01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.100
PlayStation Plus, the essentials.

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:16.020
So what free games are you getting with that?

01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:16.980
Some interesting ones.

01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:20.580
Meet Your Maker is going to be the free game for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:22.980
This one's interesting because it's going to be a day one release.

01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:27.940
This is the new game from Behavior Entertainment, although I don't believe it's anything to

01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:29.140
do with horror or anything like that.

01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:32.900
It sounds more like a building fortress type of thing.

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:34.580
It kind of is scary.

01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:35.220
Oh, interesting.

01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:35.720
Okay.

01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:42.920
So Meet Your Maker is you build different levels a la kind of Mario Maker, but there's

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.600
death traps all the way through them.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.320
Oh, okay.

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:45.960
Interesting.

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.000
You have to get to the center, get something and get out.

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.720
And every time it keeps track of your deaths as you go through it.

01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.920
It's not a bad game.

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:55.800
I was in the beta.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.680
It wasn't my cup of tea, but it's a great game.

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.600
Well, and the good news about it being on PlayStation Plus is that people will be able

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:05.080
to grab it.

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.800
And, you know, for better or for worse, I haven't played this game.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.600
I have no idea if it's good or not from my perspective, but I do know things like Rocket

01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.240
League have launched day one on PlayStation and been very, very successful as a result.

01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.200
So we'll see what happens.

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:22.600
Also, other games for PlayStation.

01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:23.960
I'm very excited about this.

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.560
Sackboy, A Big Adventure.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.480
That was one of the first titles on PlayStation 5, but it's also on PlayStation 4.

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:34.680
That is, it's not LittleBigPlanet, but it's LittleBigPlanet's mascot in a somewhat LittleBigPlanet

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:35.560
type of game.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.520
That is the best cosplay.

01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:38.840
Yes.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.680
And it just doesn't have the build your own stuff, but it looks like it'll be fun.

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.800
And Tales of Iron is also going to be available.

01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:49.480
That is an RPG that it'll be available as well.

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:52.040
That's all coming in April, starting April 4th.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:57.000
So on Tuesday, which a reminder, if you want to get the March games, which includes Minecraft

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.920
Dungeons on PlayStation and some of the other releases, I forget what all was there.

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:03.080
I think one of the Call of Duty games was this month.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.440
You can grab those before they're gone.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.880
Over on the Microsoft side of the house, two new games announced for April.

01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:12.200
I got to admit, these are more under the radar games.

01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:17.400
I'm not familiar with these like the other side, but we do have Out of Space Couch Edition

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:20.520
will be available April 1st through April 30th.

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:27.400
And Peaky Blinders Mastermind will be available from April 16th to May 15th because Microsoft

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.040
does that interesting middle of the month switch that they do over there.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.520
So neither of these games are high dollar games.

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:35.960
Out of Space is a $10 game.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:38.040
Peaky Blinders is a $25 game.

01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:39.720
So I will kind of point.

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.600
Space sounds like it'd be like a hoarders game.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:43.320
Yeah, I don't know.

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:43.720
I don't know.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:47.800
So, but again, I don't want to poop with these games just because they're lower studios.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:50.680
I haven't, sometimes those are the best games to come out on these things.

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:55.320
So, but they're just, they're games I'm unaware of as of yet, but Xbox games with gold will

01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:57.720
give me the chance to grab them for free and try them out.

01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.080
All right.

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:03.080
Let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week that you

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.120
can pay full price for.

01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.040
Or maybe, maybe on sale.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:06.600
We'll see.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.560
Loki, how about the US?

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:14.440
We have Grim Grimoire Once More on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:20.360
Meet Your Maker on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:27.560
Road 96, Mile Zero on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:28.440
Xbox Series.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:35.400
Curse of the Sea Rats on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:36.280
Xbox Series.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.640
Dungeons of Aether on Nintendo Switch.

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:45.720
Everspace 2 on PC, Mac, and Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:53.560
Looks like Marfusha on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

01:51:54.520 --> 01:52:03.320
Paparazzi on Nintendo Switch, EA Sports PGA Tour on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:07.720
And then we'll also have, oh, that's it.

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:08.600
Actually, that is it.

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.200
All right.

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:15.000
Traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases over there, we will start with the

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:21.720
Nintendo Switch because we don't really do the Xbox releases in Japan for reasons that

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:23.480
we've talked about earlier in the show.

01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.360
But we will mention some of the games that are releasing on the Switch on April the,

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:32.840
actually, I don't think we have any releases in Japan this week.

01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:34.280
Wait, wait, wait.

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.120
It's not, is it, hold on.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.200
Oh, it is April.

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:42.840
It might be, yeah, because we don't have any big releases in Japan.

01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:43.720
Not even on the...

01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:46.920
Actually, Golden Week is April 29th.

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.760
It is the end of the month.

01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:49.000
Yeah.

01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:49.800
Yeah.

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:51.320
There is...

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.720
But I knew Golden Week was around April.

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:54.520
April-ish, yeah.

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:56.280
Yeah.

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:59.400
For whatever reason, it's a non-week week in Japan.

01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:01.400
There's really nothing releasing over there.

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:02.760
There's like an AC adapter.

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.720
You need a third party one of those.

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:10.200
Everyone do extra work so that you can take the week off for Golden Week week.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:11.080
Yeah, I guess so.

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.800
Nope, no releases this week.

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:15.000
Okay.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.080
We do have stuff on the 13th, though, but that's next week.

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.400
Well, in the UK, we have a handful of releases.

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:25.320
On April 4th on Switch, we have Hello Neighbor 2.

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:29.160
And on Switch also, we have the Hello Neighbor 2 Deluxe Edition.

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:33.960
On PlayStation and Xbox, we have Firefighting Sim The Squad.

01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:38.360
On the 6th for PlayStation and Switch, we have Curse of the Sea Rats.

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:45.000
Also on the 6th for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, Blade Assault.

01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:51.000
And on the 7th on PlayStation and Xbox, we have EA Sports PGA Tour.

01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:52.620
Yawn.

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.400
I want them to have, though...

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:59.480
Okay, you know what will make golf games interesting to me?

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.520
Add Drunk Scotsman mode.

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.840
Play the Kirby golf game.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.760
That would be my take.

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:14.600
Go back and listen to Robin Williams describing the creation of golf.

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:18.200
And then I want that to be the announcer in the game with lots

01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:21.000
of Drunk Scotsman, and that would make it an interesting game.

01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:24.280
I mean, we could do that now with AI.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:25.640
New dream game.

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:30.680
I just realized I'm looking at the game playing behind Loki tonight,

01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:32.360
because I saw the whole isometric.

01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:34.120
I wasn't really paying attention to it until now.

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:35.000
I saw the whole isometric.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.640
I was like, oh, is that Kirby's Dream Course?

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:40.920
Oh, no, it's a Sonic Endless Runner of some sort.

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:41.560
What is that?

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:45.560
No, it's the Sonic Has Been Murdered game.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:47.400
Oh, and I haven't played it yet.

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:48.120
Okay.

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:48.520
Yeah.

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:52.120
And wasn't that, like, the isometric mode from 3D Blast?

01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.440
Oh, I swear to kind of.

01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:57.400
It was that arcade game that I covered for Classic Game, like,

01:54:57.400 --> 01:54:58.840
an age ago that was really weird.

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:01.240
I looked at just the right time where I saw a minigame and not

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:03.000
the actual murder part.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:03.500
Okay.

01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:04.680
All right.

01:55:04.680 --> 01:55:06.120
Please do not murder a Sonic.

01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:07.240
Okay, thanks, bye.

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.280
Let's do a few more stories, and then we will invite your phone

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.840
calls over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:14.840
But first, we have a few more stories.

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.520
This one is fascinating to me.

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:17.020
Loki?

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:21.640
Yes, apparently the makers of Dolphin have announced that

01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:26.360
the GameCube and Wii emulator is coming to Steam early access

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.160
later this year.

01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:31.640
So the emulator obviously will be in there, but, you know,

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.160
the ROMs will not.

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:39.320
He said our great experiment, Dolphin is coming to Steam.

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.280
We're pleased to finally tell the world of our experiment.

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:45.640
This has been a product of many months of work, and we look

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:48.760
forward to getting it into users' hands soon.

01:55:48.760 --> 01:55:51.000
It says while Dolphin's Steam page is already live, the

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.320
emulator will be officially available through Valve's

01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:55.400
storefront until sometime in the next few months.

01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.800
It says the Dolphin emulator does not come with games.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:04.040
We do not condone piracy of any shape or form, and this

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:07.080
software is built to run legally acquired games.

01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:10.520
I wonder how quickly it's going to be before Nintendo tries

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.640
to take this down.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:13.640
Although I don't know if they really, I mean, maybe they

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:17.960
can, as long as it's no part of their actual, like, no system

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.720
bias or anything like that.

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:21.480
I don't know.

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.400
Yeah, I'm seriously curious about the legality of this.

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.400
I also find this news was very oddly timed because this

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.440
news came out literally a day after the 3DS and Wii U shops

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:32.840
went down.

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:36.760
And I know that this is about GameCube and Wii games, but

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:39.560
there's a part of me that wonders, maybe the Wii U shop

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:43.960
going down rendering Wii games unbuyable, if there's something

01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:45.320
going on with that.

01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:50.440
Technically, you can play like the WiiWare stuff, or I don't

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:51.080
know what they call it.

01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:54.280
I think it's the WiiWare through those emulators.

01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:57.080
So yeah, it'll be interesting.

01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.080
I mean, and to be fair, that's the only way you're going to

01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:04.120
be able to do things like Final Fantasy IV, the after years,

01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.360
the non-graphically enhanced versions.

01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:08.840
Some of those were that actually look like the old games.

01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:11.080
That was all on the WiiWare.

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:12.920
So interesting.

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.120
Interesting, interesting.

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:17.560
Okay, moving on.

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:18.200
Dark Sakura.

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:25.080
Well, something that we touched about was about Silent Hill 2

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:27.160
remake being effectively done.

01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:29.160
And there was some clarification released on that.

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:37.560
Bloober Team did address what was considered an accurate

01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:38.200
translation.

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:43.640
They say it is not true that we announced Silent Hill 2 is

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:44.440
ready for release.

01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:46.600
I am reading this from a quote.

01:57:46.600 --> 01:57:49.080
Regardless of the development stage, all of our activities

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.200
are focused on obtaining the highest quality for the finished

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:53.320
product.

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:59.080
The quality of fans of Silent Hill 2

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:00.200
deserve.

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.480
The statement refers to sales forecasts, which were referenced

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.200
in the article.

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.480
And the studio's previous games reached a sales ceiling of

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:12.680
2 million copies, but they were aiming for 10 million.

01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:17.320
So right now, then they were basically more talking about

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:20.280
forecast and not about the actual game being done.

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:28.120
So, but their end quote on this is saying that we are aware

01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:30.680
that players are waiting for more information about Silent

01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:31.560
Hill 2.

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:34.200
As soon as such information becomes available, we are sure

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:36.840
that Konami, the publisher of the game, will share it with

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:37.240
fans.

01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.560
So that's it.

01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:44.600
And honestly, with the whole, like, summer fest stuff seems

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:47.640
like a good time to give more information about that type

01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:48.440
of stuff.

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:51.160
You know, just it's only a couple months away.

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:51.960
Hang on, people.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:53.000
Hang on.

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:54.920
Keep your pants on.

01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:56.520
Actually, don't.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:57.160
Take them off.

01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:57.720
We will see.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.400
All right.

01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:00.920
Pants off, pants off.

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:02.520
Who's saying I'm wearing them now?

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.020
All right.

01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:04.760
Moving on.

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:05.320
Loki.

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:07.240
It's not so great news.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:10.120
All too familiar news this year.

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:12.600
As we know, it's the end of the financial year.

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:15.320
So what's that mean when we're a successful company like

01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:16.200
Electronic Arts?

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:17.240
Yes, layoffs.

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:17.880
That's right.

01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:21.080
Because, you know, that's what they do.

01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:25.800
So they generate approximately $7 billion in that revenue

01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:29.320
last year, and now they've laid off 6% of its global

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:31.400
workforce, 7 to 800 people.

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:37.960
And while they drive greater focus across our portfolios,

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:42.120
they're moving away from projects that do not contribute

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:46.040
to their strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint

01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:47.880
and restructuring some of our teams.

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:53.240
So yeah, cool.

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:55.560
But not really.

01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:59.160
Not cool, but yeah, it's just not surprised.

01:59:59.160 --> 01:59:59.560
Yeah.

01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:01.400
And EA had a pretty good year, didn't they?

02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:02.840
Yeah.

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.480
Seven.

02:00:03.480 --> 02:00:05.800
I mean, I would think, you know, if you made $7 billion.

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:10.040
Look, I get the whole and we've gone down this road before

02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.680
and about how layoffs are supposed to be about what's

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:16.280
coming and not what's already happened, but it's still not

02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:16.840
a good look.

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:21.160
Like, and this all falls back to a theme we've talked about

02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:24.120
many times on the show, and that is perception.

02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:27.720
That's the truth, especially in the gaming industry for

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:28.600
a lot of people.

02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.320
And when you have a great year and then you lay off 800

02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:35.720
people at the end of that year, it's perceived a certain

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:37.080
way, whether it's true or not.

02:00:37.080 --> 02:00:38.200
And it doesn't read great.

02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:39.160
Yeah.

02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.400
Perception versus intention.

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:41.900
Yep.

02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:44.200
Yeah.

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:44.700
Yeah.

02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:50.440
It should just be the law or something that if a company

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:53.880
loses the money, it comes out of the upper management pay.

02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:58.840
Or that a certain percentage of cuts come from upper management

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:01.320
as well, but that'll never happen.

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:06.040
Sadly, Prince Peach Fuzz says layoffs or cut management

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.880
bonuses. Exactly.

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:08.520
That part.

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:09.080
Exactly.

02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:12.680
Fixation Gay says, especially since they are making Sims

02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:14.040
five, this sucks.

02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:17.000
Yeah, there's still a lot of things EA still working on

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.440
that we expect will do fine.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.720
Well, and on top of that, I mean, how much revenue are

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:24.440
they pulling from the 50,000 Sims 4?

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:26.920
Literally, literally.

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:29.400
All right.

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:32.040
I mean, there's a reason why I practically lived on the

02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:35.160
Sims resource so I could get cool stuff.

02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:39.320
Mike Deft says it very succinctly in our chat.

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.760
Unionize.

02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:41.980
Yes.

02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:44.120
Unionize game industry.

02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:46.200
A few of you already have.

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:47.240
Learn from your peers.

02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:48.280
That tide is coming.

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:49.160
That tide is coming.

02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:50.600
All right.

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:53.640
Well, a game that I wish EA wishes they made, but unfortunately

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:54.120
they didn't.

02:01:54.120 --> 02:01:57.720
It was publisher Rogue Games and developer Dabado Games is

02:01:57.720 --> 02:01:58.600
releasing.

02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:01.720
Hey, look, you know we love our rhythm games here on Orange

02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.360
Lawns Radio.

02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.680
We are rooted in rhythm game history.

02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:06.200
Dark Soccer, Loki, myself.

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.120
We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution.

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.160
We'd love to play Para Para, BeatMania 2DX.

02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:14.760
Hell, we were even on the news about Guitar Hero one time.

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.200
We love music games.

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.240
On my house.

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:20.520
And that's why we have to close the show tonight before we

02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:21.160
get to your calls.

02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:25.640
Anyway, talking about Hello Kitty and Friends Happiness

02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:26.120
Parade.

02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:30.040
It's coming out on the Switch, and it'll be out April 13th

02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:31.400
for $19.99.

02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:34.760
But 15% discount if you get it in the first week, because

02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.520
that's when they want to sell it.

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:38.760
By the way, not just on the Switch and the eShop, but if

02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:39.560
you want.

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:43.960
I'm sorry, this actually already launched for iOS and Android,

02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:46.440
and it was also a Netflix exclusive thing.

02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:49.880
My phone is my webcam, and I can't get it right now.

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:53.960
Launched in November, but now it's the Switch version that's

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:54.440
coming out.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.760
If you want to know more about it, get ready for a fun and

02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:01.640
unexpected journey through the world of Sanrio in a music

02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:03.880
rhythm game like nothing you've experienced before.

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.720
Join Hello Kitty and two friends on a delightful music tour

02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:09.880
as they spread happiness to everyone.

02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:12.200
Along the way, they'll discover new friends to join their

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.400
musical parades.

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:17.240
However, jealous of Hello Kitty's growing fan base, Kuromi

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:20.520
will stop at nothing to end the music, dispatching goons and

02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.680
laying traps to stop the momentum.

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.720
It's up to you to dance, dance, dance to the beat, avoid

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:29.160
traps, use each character's unique abilities, collect coins

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:31.400
and upgrades, complete challenges, and bring joy to the

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.680
world around you.

02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:36.440
With a robust soundtrack filled with over 40 amazing pop

02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:36.840
hits.

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:40.360
I wonder what those hits are, but they're probably Japanese

02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:40.600
hits.

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:42.680
They all sound like they're in Japanese.

02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:45.080
You'll be dancing to the music long after you put the

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.360
controllers down.

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.520
So it actually looks, it's interesting because it looks

02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:50.520
like it might be like a little bit of like a runner kind

02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:51.400
of game.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:54.360
But like, I'm trying to, let me try to show this on the other

02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:55.880
screen here as I'm doing this live.

02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.760
Watching the trailer and it's very derivative, but the layout

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:02.200
is what's unique, I think.

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:02.700
Yeah.

02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:06.600
So I'm trying to feel like how this kind of plays.

02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:09.160
It's kind of hard to tell from the screenshots, but it kind

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:11.000
of looks like you're going down a track sort of thing.

02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:12.600
Oh, hold on.

02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:16.120
All I know is that you can play Bad Batsumaru, and that's

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:17.160
the most important part.

02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:18.440
And he's huge.

02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:19.080
He is.

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:21.080
That's as he needs to be.

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.360
Here's the character select screen.

02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:23.080
There it is.

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.920
Because I know you all want to know what characters are in

02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:25.000
it.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:25.640
So there you go.

02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:28.760
That may not be all of them.

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:33.480
Oh, you actually, you're on the, I found this elsewhere,

02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:36.040
but no, that's just the same link we had.

02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:36.600
Nevermind.

02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:36.920
Sorry.

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:38.280
Was there a trailer embedded?

02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:39.720
There's a trailer on the page.

02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:40.840
Oh, there sure is.

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:41.960
From another source.

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:44.840
And apparently I think it was the same one.

02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:45.000
Yeah.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:45.480
Oh, okay.

02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:48.440
So it kind of looks like you move around to the beat sort

02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.000
of thing.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:49.500
Okay.

02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:53.240
Like an audio surf kind of thing or something like that.

02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.160
Oh, you have to dance around the spike box.

02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:55.480
Okay.

02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.720
They show like this photo mode thing where I guess you get

02:04:57.720 --> 02:04:59.720
like a special, it was on this one.

02:04:59.720 --> 02:05:00.220
Yeah.

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.440
I thought pretty cool.

02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:02.760
Okay.

02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:04.840
So what's going on?

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:07.640
You have like a twisting path with people on either side of

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:07.800
it.

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:10.920
It has three segments on each path with coins on them.

02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:14.440
And so I reckon that you have to be on the path to collect

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.960
the coins as it goes.

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:21.080
At different intervals, there is a, like a, I guess a checkpoint

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.440
line, like in a race.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.080
And at that point, if you pass the photo shoot one, you get

02:05:27.080 --> 02:05:29.320
like a special mode where it focuses in on your character

02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:32.440
with lights and animations and whatnot.

02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:36.280
So for people who are not watching.

02:05:37.080 --> 02:05:37.480
Thank you.

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.080
Yes.

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:39.580
All right.

02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:43.640
Comments in chat.

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:46.360
Mike Def says, so it's a runner rhythm game with Hello Kitty

02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:46.840
and friends.

02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:47.400
Sign me up.

02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:47.640
Yeah.

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:50.200
Hey, 20 bucks or apparently Netflix.

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.800
It might be free on the phones.

02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:55.880
So bonds 006 says I may just try that Hello Kitty game for

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:56.520
research.

02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:59.320
Hey, look, all these years later, we still want to bring you

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:00.920
the latest and greatest in music gaming.

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:01.560
So there you go.

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:03.000
Hey, Rob.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:03.480
What?

02:06:03.480 --> 02:06:05.000
I just had a flash of memory.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:05.500
Okay.

02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:10.780
You and me in Burlingame at what was it called?

02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:11.500
Network video.

02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:13.500
Oh, Jesus.

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:13.740
Okay.

02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:14.940
This would have been a long time ago.

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:19.660
And you bought a game that I found and passed on to you

02:06:19.660 --> 02:06:20.780
called Kitty the cool.

02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:23.100
Oh, my God.

02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:23.340
Yeah.

02:06:23.340 --> 02:06:23.580
Yeah.

02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:24.300
Yeah.

02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:25.740
And you know what I bought that day?

02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:27.580
Vib ribbon.

02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:27.980
Yeah.

02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:28.940
I remember Vib ribbon.

02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:30.300
Yep.

02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:31.820
Oh, what a day.

02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:32.460
Good times.

02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:33.580
Yeah.

02:06:33.660 --> 02:06:36.140
I just had a very vivid memory of it all of a sudden.

02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:36.380
No.

02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:36.780
All good.

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:37.260
I love it.

02:06:37.260 --> 02:06:37.820
All right.

02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:39.180
RIP network video.

02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:41.420
We're going to get to some calls.

02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:45.740
We invite your calls through our Discord server, vognetwork.com

02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:46.380
slash discord.

02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:46.700
You know what?

02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:48.540
Even if you don't want to call, you just want to hang out

02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:49.660
with us throughout the week.

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:52.460
We get a lot of stories that get posted the OLR channel.

02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:56.460
You get to see me make fun of tweets and say a lot of things

02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:57.180
throughout the week.

02:06:57.180 --> 02:07:00.860
So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:07:00.860 --> 02:07:02.700
We do have a call waiting in the green room.

02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:04.540
If you want to call into the show, the green room is the

02:07:04.540 --> 02:07:07.500
place to go because you can't actually see Archa through

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:08.940
the magical mystery of Discord.

02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:11.660
You can't actually see our room where we're recording now,

02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:14.540
but that for obvious Twitch related security purposes,

02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:15.180
we don't.

02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:17.900
We're not a wide open room, but we'll pull you in from the

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:21.260
green room if we see you in there, such as this caller,

02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.380
who we've heard from before.

02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:24.060
And I'm excited to welcome back.

02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:25.820
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:26.220
Who's this?

02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:28.460
This is ActDeft.

02:07:28.460 --> 02:07:29.340
Hey, ActDeft.

02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:30.860
It is great to hear from you.

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:31.500
What's up, buddy?

02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:38.060
Well, do you want to write more about Niantic?

02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:40.140
Do I have a choice?

02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:42.540
We do.

02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:44.620
But yeah, I want to talk about that.

02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:49.260
I want to pretty much stay my opinion on that because,

02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:54.060
you know, and everyone knows I'm an avid Pokemon Go player.

02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:55.020
Yes, you are.

02:07:55.020 --> 02:08:00.540
And yeah, I'm definitely not happy with how Niantic has handled

02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:06.300
things in the past year, probably even.

02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:12.300
But this is probably, yeah, one of the worst decisions they

02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:17.740
have made because, and yeah, it's the remote raid thing.

02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:21.900
It's like, I know that not many people that, okay, I'm going

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:26.620
to rave and I'm going to use those passes like a lot.

02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:31.500
But at the same time, and I've seen it because I know people

02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:35.980
that are disabled or have a condition and cannot go outside

02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:42.060
like easily or have access to those places and they have

02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:44.060
to rely on those remote raids.

02:08:44.780 --> 02:08:49.180
So it actually makes me angry for them because Niantic knows

02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:50.540
this. They know.

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:55.340
They have less than according to them.

02:08:56.140 --> 02:09:00.620
And it's like baffling that they keep making these decisions

02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:05.660
without considering what is happening to the player base.

02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:12.300
And I've heard this from other podcasts, other people, that

02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:17.740
they should be rewarding people that are going out and playing

02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:21.900
incentivizing to go out instead of punishing players that

02:09:22.700 --> 02:09:25.500
cannot go out, that cannot play outside.

02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:32.300
I know that the thing you have to do in Pokemon Go is go out,

02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:35.500
catch them all, play, meet people and all that.

02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:38.140
And I understand that I actually enjoy that part of the

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:42.540
game, but at the same time, it's like not everyone can do it.

02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.620
And we should have the option.

02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:53.260
We should have more of, okay, like something like the incense

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:58.940
that also like costs a lot of outrage.

02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:03.820
You know, during the pandemic, we had the one minute instance,

02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:07.020
like every minute you had to spawn for one hour.

02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:09.580
And okay, that was really great.

02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:10.780
It was a good change.

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:14.300
And they change it back to five minutes.

02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:18.620
If you're stationary, if you're walking, if you're moving

02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:23.500
fast enough, you get the one minute spawn, but they could

02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:27.100
have changed that like they did with the daily incense.

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:31.740
Like, okay, if you go out, if you're moving, if we see you're

02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:35.820
moving, you get better spawns, you get legendaries, you get

02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:41.020
like see the legendaries, you get more good stuff.

02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:44.220
But if you're stationary, okay, you get the regular spawns,

02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:48.380
you get normal stuff, you get normal like by going out.

02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:53.180
But I also want to clarify, Deft, I agree with you totally

02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:54.140
on what you're saying.

02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:57.180
One thing that was interesting about that daily adventure

02:10:57.180 --> 02:11:00.940
incense is that they, and again, it's a key problem with

02:11:00.940 --> 02:11:03.980
with the whole messaging this time, that daily adventure

02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.300
incense came out after the bad news announcement.

02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:10.220
And it was one of those things where I was like, you know,

02:11:10.220 --> 02:11:12.380
maybe if they'd said this when they've done the other that

02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:14.460
they're going to give you a free 50 minute incense every

02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:17.100
day, maybe it would have lessened the blow a little bit

02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:18.860
and that and I feel like it's the mistake they're making

02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:19.260
here.

02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:21.180
But one other thing I want to say with the remote raids,

02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:22.220
because I think this is important.

02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:23.180
I didn't say it earlier.

02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:26.700
I've always felt those remote raids were pretty bullshit.

02:11:26.700 --> 02:11:28.140
And I'm going to tell you why.

02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:29.580
And it's not what you think.

02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:34.300
It's because you're not guaranteed to get that Pokemon.

02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:38.140
So you're jacking up the price from 100 to 195.

02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:42.300
And I'm not even guaranteed to get the Pokemon at the end

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:42.700
of the day.

02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:45.180
I mean, what a joke.

02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:50.300
At least the ones in person, you get a free pass every day.

02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:51.580
So, okay, I use my pass.

02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:52.620
I didn't get it today.

02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:54.380
All right, whatever, whatever it worked out.

02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:56.220
I would say from the get go.

02:11:56.940 --> 02:11:58.780
And I think part of this kind of plays into some of the

02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:00.460
things I was saying earlier that may not have been as

02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:00.860
popular.

02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:04.460
But from my perspective, the remote raids have never been

02:12:04.460 --> 02:12:08.940
an equal playing field to what's going on out what's

02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:10.060
happening in the real world.

02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:12.380
It's bullshit that it's not a guaranteed chance if you're

02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:13.500
going to spend that kind of money.

02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:15.180
It's gambling.

02:12:15.180 --> 02:12:16.780
It's mature rated in Australia.

02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:22.940
And even then, it's like, okay, the good news they gave us

02:12:22.940 --> 02:12:25.900
for going like in person raids.

02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:28.140
Oh, you're going to get XL candy.

02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:29.420
You're going to get more XL candy.

02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:30.140
Yeah.

02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:33.500
It's like, yeah, we already have the bonus active.

02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:37.020
It's something that should be happening already.

02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:40.780
Like, okay, if you're going to give us like those XL candies

02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:43.580
that are really valuable in the game, okay, then make

02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:48.780
probably, okay, more XP bonuses, more stardust bonuses,

02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:51.980
give us more incentive to go out and play.

02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:56.620
Because on the other hand, and I said this on Twitter, it's

02:12:56.620 --> 02:13:00.060
like, I barely raid right now.

02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:03.340
It's like, I barely do raids because I don't have the time

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:04.460
to do them.

02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:08.140
It's like, if someone invites me, I'll probably do it.

02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:11.340
And because it's something I really want, or I'm grinding

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:13.900
for a certain Pokemon.

02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:16.940
But right now, it's like, why even bother?

02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:19.340
Yeah, I stopped buying the passes.

02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:20.700
So I feel bad when I get the invites.

02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:23.020
I never go in, but I stopped buying the passes.

02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:27.900
I only buy passes if I have the coins for it because I leave

02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:28.940
my Pokemon in gyms.

02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:30.460
Sure, that's it.

02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:30.860
Sure.

02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:31.340
And that's it.

02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:32.780
I had to buy storage and stuff.

02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:35.340
And I've been trying not to throw Niantic money.

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:37.980
So I've been just kind of in that game anyway.

02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:40.060
I've just been stockpiling my gym coins.

02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:41.260
Yeah, same thing, basically.

02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:43.340
But I'm not really buying remote raid passes because I've

02:13:43.340 --> 02:13:44.540
just had one too many raids.

02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:48.220
It's interesting because the raids I'm okay with remote

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:50.860
raiding are the mega evolution ones, because you're always

02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:53.740
guaranteed to get mega evolution juice, even if you don't

02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:54.540
catch the Pokemon.

02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:57.660
It's weird because I think the mega evolutions of Pokemon

02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:58.380
Go are silly.

02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:00.780
I don't really care for them, but it's actually the best

02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:03.420
better rating mechanic are those mega evolution raids,

02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:05.260
because you're always guaranteed at least something.

02:14:06.300 --> 02:14:10.140
Yeah, at least there's something desirable outside of XP

02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:10.860
and Stardust.

02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:12.460
You know, people are going to say, well, you get those.

02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:14.780
It's not the same and you know it.

02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:18.460
Yeah, it's not the same, but at least there's something

02:14:18.460 --> 02:14:19.660
always worth it.

02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:22.780
Like, even with legendary raids and other raids, it's like,

02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:24.860
okay, you get the chance for a shiny.

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:28.620
You get the chance for if you're living up, you want to

02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:29.180
Stardust.

02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:32.700
It's like, okay, you do them because, okay, it's fun sometimes.

02:14:33.580 --> 02:14:36.860
But again, in this case, it's like, why even bother?

02:14:36.860 --> 02:14:40.220
It's like, why should I even go out and raid?

02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:42.300
Because there's no incentive to do so.

02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:42.860
Right.

02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:47.020
And even like with remote raiding, it's like, I mostly do it

02:14:47.020 --> 02:14:49.020
because, oh, I'm helping someone else.

02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:55.100
And even like today, I had the problem with a Pokemon

02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:59.820
girlfriend that he needed people to beat out a Loye.

02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:00.940
That's the legendary right now.

02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:05.420
And we couldn't do the raid because there wasn't enough

02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:05.740
people.

02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:12.300
So right now, even like now, people are not even like

02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:16.060
actively going out for raiding or doing raids in that way

02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:19.900
because it's also kind of expensive, like buying every

02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:24.140
single time, like a 100 coin pass.

02:15:25.340 --> 02:15:30.380
It's like, even then, it's like, wow, it's dumb.

02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:34.540
And it's one of the many dumb decisions Niantic has done

02:15:34.540 --> 02:15:37.260
again in the past few years, in the last year, at least.

02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:40.060
And this is where it's starting to get annoying is that

02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:42.300
this is at least the third time, at least the third time

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:44.940
now they've made a major game decision that seems completely

02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:48.140
tone deaf to the community and especially the ways they're

02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:48.940
announcing it and everything.

02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:51.420
It's hard to watch.

02:15:51.420 --> 02:15:54.220
It's getting to be very hard to watch that they can be this

02:15:56.060 --> 02:16:01.260
unwilling to change their ways and like not listen to advice

02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:01.980
yet again.

02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:04.860
But anyway, I think the remote raids were kind of busted

02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:07.020
from the start, to be quite honest, but I get it.

02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:09.980
And I'll keep playing.

02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:12.620
I enjoy Pokemon Go for what it is.

02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:14.860
I enjoy going out playing.

02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:19.900
I have friends that have recently either come back to play

02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.980
or are new to the game.

02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:26.220
So it's like, oh, I have someone to play with.

02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:30.700
At least if I go out, I can tell them and we can go there.

02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:31.740
We can go to a park.

02:16:31.740 --> 02:16:33.580
We can go to this or that.

02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:38.300
So it's like that part is still fun, but it's part of what

02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:39.340
the game already was.

02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:43.660
So again, I'm not going to uninstall the game or anything.

02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:47.660
People are saying that you should probably turn off

02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:51.580
Adventure Sync because that's another way they're generating

02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:55.180
or getting your info of location.

02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:55.980
Interesting.

02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:59.900
If you're like that extreme, it's like, oh, I'm not going

02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:03.660
to uninstall the game, but I don't want to get Niantic any

02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:07.820
money or any more money, turn off Adventure Sync.

02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:09.900
You know what another thing it can do?

02:17:10.460 --> 02:17:12.140
And I don't think I've seen a lot of people talking about

02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:13.740
this, probably because nobody's doing it anyway.

02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:16.140
But here, 100%, if you really want to get Niantic,

02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:18.860
don't scan Poke Stops, period.

02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:22.860
Do not, under any circumstance, for any reward, scan

02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:24.060
Poke Stops.

02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:26.380
That is the data they really want.

02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:28.540
And that's where they're trying to push.

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:31.100
They even announced for Ingress 3D glyph hacking.

02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:32.860
I think it was something they talked about

02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:33.500
Stop by Southwest.

02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:35.260
So we're going to start to see the features from that.

02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:37.180
But in order for them to roll out those features, they

02:17:37.180 --> 02:17:39.900
have to have the data around Poke Stops.

02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:44.700
So that is honestly the number one thing you could do if

02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:46.380
you really want to stick it to Niantic.

02:17:46.380 --> 02:17:49.820
Do not, under any circumstance, scan Poke Stops.

02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:53.580
Basically, don't give them any info they want.

02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:56.940
That's the whole summary of it.

02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:58.860
But yeah, I'm going to keep playing.

02:17:58.860 --> 02:18:01.820
But yeah, I'm not going to invest any more money in the

02:18:01.820 --> 02:18:06.220
game unless they make some changes in the future or as soon

02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:09.340
as possible to make the game better for everyone.

02:18:10.220 --> 02:18:11.100
I want to ask you one more thing.

02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:12.620
We have a caller waiting, so I want to get to them too.

02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:14.460
But one more quick question before I let you go.

02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:17.260
What do you think of this whole latest kind of like

02:18:17.260 --> 02:18:21.740
conspiracy theory, if you will, that Niantic never intended

02:18:21.740 --> 02:18:25.980
to set the price at $195, because apparently it was

02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:28.700
data mined some time ago that the price of remote passes

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:29.980
was going to be $150.

02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:33.580
So Niantic, what they're doing here, and this is again,

02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:36.700
nobody knows this for sure, but this is what some tinfoil

02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:39.980
hat folks on social media and YouTube channels especially

02:18:39.980 --> 02:18:43.820
are saying is that Niantic never intended, intends to go

02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:45.100
to $195.

02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:47.580
They're going to make it look like, oh, we're listening to

02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:49.980
the community and so we're going to bring it back.

02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:54.700
We're going to compromise and set it to $150 when it was

02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:56.300
always intended to be $150.

02:18:56.300 --> 02:18:56.700
Gotcha.

02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:03.740
Um, I can't believe the conspiracy theory there, but at

02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:09.100
the same time, since we have like, we have gotten leaks

02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:12.620
from Pokemon Go in the sense that they haven't released

02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:13.180
something yet.

02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:19.020
And I can speak like in terms of Scarlet and Violet, we

02:19:19.020 --> 02:19:21.900
learned about Gimmigo before the game even launched.

02:19:21.900 --> 02:19:22.780
True.

02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:26.060
So it's like, maybe it's something, okay, they are listening

02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:28.300
and they're going to revert, but they haven't gone into,

02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:31.020
to, okay, we're going to make this change this way.

02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:34.620
But at the same time, and this is something I also want

02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:40.140
to say on record, that the price increase for me isn't

02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:41.020
the deal breaker.

02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:43.900
They could have increased the price, whatever.

02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:48.300
It's the thing that they're limiting the rates for only

02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:48.860
five a day.

02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:54.620
That's the thing that's getting to me that it's like,

02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:55.420
why are you limited?

02:19:56.140 --> 02:19:59.420
Like, it's like, again, not all people that are remote

02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:03.820
rating are going to spend like, oh, I'm going to buy 10

02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:06.220
passes or I'm going to buy 20.

02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:09.500
Most people that do that are probably most of the people

02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:11.340
that are going to go out and rate it anyways.

02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:16.140
And I know them because I watch also those Poketubers too.

02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:18.620
And I know people that do that.

02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:20.700
It's like, yeah, they're going to do it anyway.

02:20:20.700 --> 02:20:21.980
They're going to buy the passes.

02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:25.980
It's the thing that they're limiting to people that are

02:20:25.980 --> 02:20:28.140
probably, again, that cannot probably go out.

02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:29.500
They cannot move.

02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:33.900
They cannot access certain places that it's like, why?

02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:35.260
Why limit that?

02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:38.860
Why nerf the passes in that way?

02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:40.780
Yeah, it does seem odd.

02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:44.300
I don't know anyone that rates that much remotely anyway,

02:20:44.300 --> 02:20:47.340
but I'm sure they must have the data for it, I guess.

02:20:47.340 --> 02:20:48.220
But anyway.

02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:50.380
All right, I'm going to let you go, my friend.

02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:51.660
Thank you so much for the phone call.

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:54.380
And we'll see what kind of meetings happen this weekend

02:20:54.380 --> 02:20:57.980
when Niantic says tomorrow and maybe Tuesday.

02:20:57.980 --> 02:20:58.780
So we'll see.

02:20:58.780 --> 02:20:59.100
Yeah.

02:20:59.100 --> 02:20:59.340
All right.

02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:00.540
Take care, my friend.

02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:01.420
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:02.060
Thank you.

02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:02.460
Take care.

02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:02.860
Bye bye.

02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:03.980
All right.

02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:06.940
We're going to hop on actually to one more quick call here.

02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:09.980
Let me just change the cameras around live and let's welcome

02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:11.020
another caller.

02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:12.620
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:13.020
Who's this?

02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:15.900
Hi, my name is Fixation Gaze.

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:16.300
Hello.

02:21:16.300 --> 02:21:17.340
Well, I remember you.

02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:19.580
You were here last week, but it's great to hear from you.

02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:20.140
How are you?

02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:22.540
Oh, I'm great.

02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:26.860
I just was I because you were talking about EA and Sims was

02:21:26.860 --> 02:21:29.020
one of my hyper fixations like Resident Evil.

02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:31.900
You uncracked my autistic Uber potential.

02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:34.860
And now I'm here to rant about how mad I am at EA about Sims.

02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:36.140
Well, please let's talk.

02:21:36.140 --> 02:21:39.660
Let's talk about how mad you are at EA.

02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:41.500
That was one of my fixations, too.

02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:43.180
So yeah, I feel you.

02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:44.780
I spent last summer.

02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:49.500
I think I have over 2000 hours in Sims 4 on its own.

02:21:49.500 --> 02:21:50.140
Oh, my gosh.

02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:51.260
I was a Sims kid, too.

02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:54.380
I spent years on that stupid game.

02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:56.140
But I wanted to say, fun fact.

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:58.940
Do you know how much it costs to get every single add on for

02:21:58.940 --> 02:21:59.500
the Sims?

02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:02.780
Bob Parker number.

02:22:02.780 --> 02:22:03.820
1500.

02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:04.780
I'd go higher.

02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:06.940
I'll say 4300.

02:22:08.300 --> 02:22:09.820
You both actually were incorrect.

02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:10.860
It is much lower than that.

02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:14.060
It is currently $995.

02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:15.340
That's cheap.

02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:16.220
Gwen, I'm closer.

02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:19.820
What price is right rules we both lost.

02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:23.900
But going back to what Gwen was saying about mortgage payments,

02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:25.900
that's two thirds of mine.

02:22:26.540 --> 02:22:27.100
Yeah.

02:22:27.100 --> 02:22:31.180
But to be fair, that doesn't sound a lot for, like, if you

02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:34.620
think about loot boxes and whatnot and buying add ons.

02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:39.180
But that in totals to 61 add ons for the game.

02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:39.980
61.

02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:42.540
Instead of updating your game.

02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:46.220
Instead, every single one of those add ons is some sort of

02:22:46.220 --> 02:22:47.180
just penny pinching.

02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:49.260
Like, oh, we made this functional.

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:50.140
Buy it.

02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:53.260
Which is actually one of the game packs because they have

02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:53.980
four different packs.

02:22:53.980 --> 02:22:55.100
They have expansions.

02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:55.980
They have game packs.

02:22:56.860 --> 02:22:57.580
And they have kits.

02:22:58.460 --> 02:23:02.220
So again, instead of balling them up into here's expansion

02:23:02.220 --> 02:23:05.660
pack one, two, three, and four, they have different gimmicks.

02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:08.540
Like, one of them in the game packs, which runs for about

02:23:08.540 --> 02:23:12.700
$20, actually makes weddings into a functional event that

02:23:12.700 --> 02:23:14.140
should have been base game.

02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:18.780
But instead it's packaged into a here's a little cool thing

02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:21.980
that we did because let's be honest, Sims 4 is a great game

02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:22.860
base game.

02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:23.420
It's cute.

02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:24.300
You can play with it.

02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:25.100
It's functional.

02:23:25.660 --> 02:23:28.460
But it's barely functional to the point of a realistic

02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:30.620
simulation of relationships.

02:23:30.620 --> 02:23:32.060
It is barely functional.

02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:35.980
People had to model this stuff in before EA did their thing.

02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:39.100
Yeah, it completely like you had to have add ons.

02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:42.060
You had to have mods in order to make it a fun game.

02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:45.020
It was functional for what it was, but they should have

02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:48.380
continued to add on to things like weddings or events or

02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:49.500
things like that.

02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:52.300
But instead they broke it down into different things with

02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:55.820
expansions, which are like the newer, like Island Living,

02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:59.580
City Life, stuff like that running about $39.99 or $40 if

02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:00.860
you just want to lump it.

02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:04.700
And then they have game packs, which are like expansions,

02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:07.260
but they're for, like, one certain thing, like the wedding

02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:11.260
expansion pack, which was about $19 or running you $20.

02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:14.860
So if you want to fix one, yeah, it's a patch.

02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:18.540
You're paying $20 for a patch, and then you have stuff packs,

02:24:18.540 --> 02:24:21.260
which, like, they have a clutter pack, they have a bathroom

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:22.940
pack, they have an infant pack.

02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:24.700
That's all like $10.

02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:28.140
And then you have things like kits that are like one or two

02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.460
different items that you can buy for $5.

02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:34.300
It is very interesting to see that business model next to

02:24:34.300 --> 02:24:38.060
something like No Man's Sky, which does these regular

02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:39.100
expansion type stuff.

02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:40.860
And they give it away as part of the base game.

02:24:40.860 --> 02:24:43.580
Now, granted, the trajectory of those two games has been

02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:44.220
very different.

02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:47.020
So I understand EA can charge it for The Sims in a way that

02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:48.860
No Man's Sky has to more prove itself.

02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:51.660
But it's just interesting.

02:24:52.380 --> 02:24:55.260
I just find it completely fascinating that instead of making

02:24:55.260 --> 02:24:57.820
a new game, like they're doing that now, of course, like

02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:59.660
they release that they're going to be doing Sims 5.

02:24:59.660 --> 02:25:02.220
But instead of making a new game or going back and doing

02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:06.140
free patches for the community, EA went, hold on, I smell

02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:08.700
money. And they've done something that no one has ever

02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:11.820
been able to recreate in form of, like, loot boxes, because

02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:15.820
in loot boxes, the fun is like, oh, my God, I can, like,

02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:17.420
there's a gambling aspect.

02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:19.740
There's an addiction to loot boxes.

02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:21.580
But to Sims stuff, they have it.

02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:23.740
So it's like, instead of because they could shove a bunch

02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:25.500
of this into an expansion pack for like $60.

02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:29.420
They could do it with the original ones when they're all

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:29.920
on disk.

02:25:30.460 --> 02:25:31.100
Yeah.

02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:34.540
But nowadays they go, oh, it's just $5 for an extra kit.

02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:36.540
It's just $20 for an extra pack.

02:25:36.540 --> 02:25:39.820
It's like, it's not a lot of money, quote unquote.

02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:42.460
So it gets you with the like, oh, yeah, I could just blow

02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:45.740
that. But then if you buy everything that's close to $1,000.

02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:49.420
Now you're giving it $20 a month for how many years?

02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:51.340
And that's how they get you.

02:25:51.340 --> 02:25:54.460
And then to add insult to all of this, at the end of all

02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:58.300
that, after Sims 5 comes out, you know there's going to be

02:25:58.300 --> 02:26:01.980
a Sims 4 Ultimate Edition that they release all over again

02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:02.780
for $70.

02:26:02.780 --> 02:26:04.220
That is the whole enchilada.

02:26:04.220 --> 02:26:06.300
It's the whole $990, whatever.

02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:07.580
We already got that.

02:26:07.580 --> 02:26:08.300
Oh, really?

02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:13.100
But we already got some sort of controversy like that.

02:26:13.100 --> 02:26:16.380
See, last year, the reason why I got back into the Sims

02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:19.420
again is they released the base game for free.

02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:20.700
Oh, that's right.

02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:21.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:25.100
And it's going to be for free for the rest of the shelf life.

02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.740
You will never have to pay $60 for the base game again.

02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:30.860
But what about for everybody who bought the game?

02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:35.180
Well, EA had an answer for them.

02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:39.260
See, they gave them a voucher for one free $5 kit.

02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:46.460
So paying $60 for the wonderful game.

02:26:46.460 --> 02:26:48.460
Here's a $5 coupon.

02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:49.740
Go pick out something you like.

02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:50.540
Here's a dollar.

02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:51.580
Go see a Star War.

02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:54.380
Not a single depreciation value.

02:26:54.380 --> 02:26:57.820
But still, how long did it stay a $60 game?

02:26:58.380 --> 02:26:58.700
Right.

02:26:59.740 --> 02:27:02.540
Because it's no longer like a $60 game.

02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:04.860
Now it's basically a free to play.

02:27:04.860 --> 02:27:06.780
Like Sims Multi.

02:27:06.780 --> 02:27:08.540
Have you ever played the Sims Mobile game?

02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:10.060
The Sims 4 Mobile game?

02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:11.100
We did for a hot minute.

02:27:12.060 --> 02:27:15.660
It is practically unplayable without any of the add on purchases.

02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:23.580
It is pretty much like you cannot play Sims Mobile without any add ons because of that's

02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:24.620
how it's built.

02:27:24.620 --> 02:27:29.260
So basically, they just turned Sims Mobile into what they want the Sims to be, where

02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:33.020
you can play to a certain extent before you're like, Oh, well, this is getting kind of bored

02:27:33.020 --> 02:27:33.980
monotonous.

02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:35.180
Let me buy this pack.

02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:35.980
Let me buy this.

02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:37.100
Let me buy that.

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:38.620
It's just five dollars.

02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:39.900
It's just, it's just.

02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:46.540
Well, and on top of that, there's other modders that are doing stuff a lot better than EA

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:47.040
did.

02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:49.900
The Maxis art was cute for a minute.

02:27:51.340 --> 02:27:51.900
And no.

02:27:52.460 --> 02:27:56.060
I want to get on the community a little bit about it.

02:27:56.060 --> 02:27:58.620
Like the Sims resource, which is one like reputable.

02:27:58.620 --> 02:27:59.660
You can go there all the time.

02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:03.420
They're now doing like memberships to get out of ads and whatnot.

02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:08.220
So it's all becoming like the Sims is becoming kind of like a luxury sort of ordeal where

02:28:08.220 --> 02:28:11.260
you can kind of pay to be part of a certain community.

02:28:11.260 --> 02:28:14.940
And I just might pay for them because it was three bucks a month, but still.

02:28:15.500 --> 02:28:19.820
Yeah, but still like that's three bucks a month on top of all the other things that

02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:23.340
you're if you're like doing Sims content, because I know a lot of people are doing just

02:28:23.340 --> 02:28:24.220
Sims content.

02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:29.260
You know, call me call me old school, but I would I would love to get a new Sims City

02:28:29.340 --> 02:28:29.580
game.

02:28:29.580 --> 02:28:33.980
And I know there was that reboot a few years ago that again, it had the always online thing.

02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:35.260
It didn't land well at all.

02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:38.060
But I'd love to see that concept revisited.

02:28:38.060 --> 02:28:39.020
I love Sim City.

02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:46.220
I think with how EA is doing things and how they are very much on the board of let's get

02:28:46.220 --> 02:28:48.220
a bunch of money for one thing.

02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:55.340
I know they're probably going to milk Sims 5 just like this, except the base pack for

02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:56.460
Sims 5.

02:28:56.460 --> 02:29:03.420
Or you can buy the deluxe pack that comes with 10 game packs of your choosing or one

02:29:03.420 --> 02:29:05.980
expansion because it will even give you less than that.

02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:11.820
Yeah, no, what they do on EA actually right now is you can bundle them and pick one game

02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:16.940
pass, one expansion, one stuff, one kit, and then you get it for like 5% cheaper, it feels

02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:18.220
like because it's not a lot.

02:29:20.380 --> 02:29:23.020
The reason why they keep doing is because they can get away with it.

02:29:23.020 --> 02:29:24.860
Oh yeah, and they get so much money out of it.

02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:31.660
Because again, if you have everything for the Sims, it is a very easily, without any

02:29:31.660 --> 02:29:35.420
mods at all, you can turn it into an entire empire of content.

02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:38.860
Especially if you use cheat codes.

02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:42.780
If you can move things around and clutter and do all the pretty aesthetic stuff, you

02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:45.420
can just make a lot of content just from doing that.

02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:48.380
You don't even need mods, mods make it better.

02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:50.620
They just motherload it and you're set.

02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:58.300
I have been playing around with the up and down motions where you can raise and lower

02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:00.780
objects and it is a game changer.

02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:07.260
If you can abuse the basement settings so that you can make things not on the same layer

02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:10.700
but you can use them on the same layer or lower objects so you can hide them inside

02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:11.740
of better looking objects.

02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:12.860
It is fascinating.

02:30:12.860 --> 02:30:17.980
I learned how to make spiral staircases and split level houses all from manipulating the

02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:18.620
game engine.

02:30:19.580 --> 02:30:23.020
Yeah, that was my jam.

02:30:23.020 --> 02:30:25.100
I kind of want to learn more things every day.

02:30:25.100 --> 02:30:26.540
I love Sims 4, I really do.

02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:30.940
EA hit the nail on the head with that kind of concept and people can't really replicate

02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:33.020
it without making the Sims.

02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:38.380
But EA is absolutely disgusting in how they've been treating their content packs.

02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:42.140
And with all that money they're making, they go and they lay off workers.

02:30:42.140 --> 02:30:42.860
Boy oh boy.

02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:49.020
I will say I am very happy with them for their LGBTQ content that they've released for free.

02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:55.580
From what I looked over, the binder packs, the scar packs that they have for it, they

02:30:55.580 --> 02:30:57.420
are actually really good.

02:30:57.420 --> 02:31:02.620
They have figure slimming things that you can get, which are gender affirming for trans

02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:03.020
women.

02:31:03.020 --> 02:31:08.140
They have binders, they have top surgery scars, the different kinds.

02:31:08.140 --> 02:31:10.220
All that stuff has honestly looked really good.

02:31:10.220 --> 02:31:13.740
Yeah, to EA's credit, they tend to be ahead of the curve.

02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:16.940
I remember they were at the early gamer X conventions before a lot of companies are

02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:19.820
getting on board and stuff, and they've always been a little bit ahead of the curve on that

02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:19.980
stuff.

02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:21.500
So credit where credit is due.

02:31:22.460 --> 02:31:27.100
The way that they handled trans characters, just to begin with, that you picked.

02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:31.020
Yeah, you could pick physical body, but you could pick different voice and you could pick

02:31:31.020 --> 02:31:31.260
different.

02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:33.340
They handled it really well.

02:31:33.340 --> 02:31:35.020
Remember SimCopter.

02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:38.540
It goes all the way back to SimCopter and some of the things that they put in those

02:31:38.540 --> 02:31:39.020
games.

02:31:39.020 --> 02:31:43.740
So anyway, currently you can actually pick your own pronouns, like your Sims pronouns,

02:31:43.740 --> 02:31:45.340
and you can do custom pronouns.

02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:46.700
That's awesome.

02:31:46.700 --> 02:31:48.780
So you can make that up.

02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:53.260
And also, although I will say that it took that update for them to also add medical equipment

02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:54.620
for disabled folks.

02:31:54.620 --> 02:32:00.380
We don't have the wheelchair yet, but you can have an insulin pump and a cochlear ear

02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:01.660
implant for your Sim.

02:32:01.660 --> 02:32:02.140
That's cool.

02:32:03.100 --> 02:32:03.580
All right.

02:32:03.580 --> 02:32:07.340
Well, Fixie, I got to let you go to try to squeeze in one more call before we get to

02:32:07.340 --> 02:32:08.060
Dead by Daylight.

02:32:08.060 --> 02:32:10.140
But thank you so much for calling in.

02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:16.460
I hope everything goes swimmingly with your own channel and all that.

02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:18.700
And if folks aren't following you, I hope they will.

02:32:19.820 --> 02:32:20.220
Of course.

02:32:20.220 --> 02:32:21.420
Thank you for having me so much.

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:25.340
I love listening in and I love adding feedback, so I will bow out now.

02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:26.060
Thank you for having me here.

02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:26.460
Take care.

02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:28.140
You're a welcome part of our community.

02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:29.500
All right.

02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:30.380
Take care, friend.

02:32:30.380 --> 02:32:31.740
Oh, there they went.

02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:33.100
Okay, one more call.

02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:34.940
We're going to squeeze in here before we wrap it up for tonight.

02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:35.980
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:36.380
Who's this?

02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:39.020
So one and only Rama.

02:32:39.020 --> 02:32:40.300
How is everybody doing tonight?

02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:41.580
I am doing fantastic.

02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:44.060
I don't know why you're coming through quiet, but I'll fix that in a minute.

02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:44.700
How are you, Rama?

02:32:45.340 --> 02:32:45.740
I'm good.

02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:46.380
Hold on.

02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:53.820
I got a new microphone stand and I've been adjusting it so that people can hear me.

02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:58.220
So if I'm coming off too low, that means I need to move the mic closer to myself.

02:32:58.220 --> 02:32:59.180
I apologize.

02:32:59.180 --> 02:32:59.660
You're fine.

02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:00.940
I can always boost you in Discord.

02:33:00.940 --> 02:33:02.220
You're not that quiet.

02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:04.700
Just maybe reading a little quieter than the three of us.

02:33:05.420 --> 02:33:06.620
But what's on your mind tonight, my friend?

02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:09.340
Things now.

02:33:09.340 --> 02:33:09.740
Great.

02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:13.900
I'm not on because I don't want to hit the wrong button and get booted from the chat.

02:33:13.900 --> 02:33:15.580
So I'm just going to leave it as is.

02:33:15.580 --> 02:33:20.300
So there's originally three things I wanted to talk about, but due to time constraints,

02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:21.820
I'll cut it down to two.

02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:22.380
All right.

02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:24.700
Number one, tick tock.

02:33:25.500 --> 02:33:31.900
Now, in my field of work, it's understandable for the employees who have it on their personal

02:33:31.900 --> 02:33:33.020
phones and so forth.

02:33:33.020 --> 02:33:39.100
And I can say this, given the nature of my work, if we handed out company phones, that

02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:42.780
will be an OK application to have.

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:49.900
Now, granted, we've had discussions in the chat about data mining and so forth, about

02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:52.300
Facebook getting caught out there and so forth.

02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:59.340
Now, I have not been following my IT papers as much as I normally would have.

02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:06.780
But going back a couple of years around a certain time or certain somebody was hating

02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:12.060
on tick tock, even before that, I.T.

02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:19.260
people in higher standing network engineers, people from various companies and entities

02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:23.020
were saying that tick tock should not be on your phone.

02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:29.180
And it's more of the aspect of the permissions that the app is has and is pulling more

02:34:29.260 --> 02:34:31.820
information than it should.

02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:33.580
Is it different from Facebook, though?

02:34:34.940 --> 02:34:41.340
I would say, all right, from a personal point of view, there is no difference from a technical

02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:44.860
point of view, from the data that they're pulling, give or take.

02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:50.860
I think it's more like even though the app has the permissions to grab certain data,

02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:53.100
it's how it's pulling the data.

02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:56.700
Again, it's been a few years since I've been reading papers on this.

02:34:56.700 --> 02:34:58.060
But what's interesting is.

02:34:59.260 --> 02:35:00.460
They were I.T.

02:35:00.460 --> 02:35:05.660
people who were saying that, you know, you should not have to talk on your phone.

02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:12.460
And then when a certain somebody got butthurt about being teased on tick tock, that's when

02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:15.100
it came in as a center of attraction.

02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:19.420
But what's funny is people were wanting to ban it because of a certain somebody getting

02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:25.660
offended, not because of the additional data that it is not supposed to have.

02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:28.220
Which is kind of crazy to me.

02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:31.500
Well, and the real reason people want to ban it is because of the China connection.

02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:33.020
Let's just call it what it is like.

02:35:33.020 --> 02:35:34.060
It's that's what it is.

02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:36.700
That's why it's being treated differently than other social media applications.

02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:44.300
Well, I will say I'm not on TikTok, but I have friends, cosplayers, content creators

02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:45.500
that are on there.

02:35:45.500 --> 02:35:47.980
I can tell you that it seems that TikTok.

02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:59.500
Plays to certain colors, genders and so forth, because I have been told, you know, if you

02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:04.780
are LGBT, expect yourself on TikTok to be a little bit lower than everybody else.

02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:09.260
And they have been called out for and they've been caught red handed for this numerous times.

02:36:10.220 --> 02:36:12.700
The algorithm is an interesting thing on TikTok.

02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:17.500
I would just say my experience is that with very minimal effort, I've been exposed to

02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:22.380
a lot more people than probably even on Twitch or some other platforms.

02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:25.260
And I've made two short videos on TikTok.

02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:29.100
It's not something I'm super invested in as a platform, but that algorithm has definitely

02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:29.980
caught my attention.

02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:37.020
I'm not well researched enough on some of the comments about LGBT suppression and things

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:40.620
of that nature to comment any further on that.

02:36:40.620 --> 02:36:42.380
I can just speak to the experience I've had so far.

02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:44.060
And you're right.

02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:50.060
And I will say I know people whose engagement on TikTok is much higher than it has been

02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:54.860
on Twitter, Instagram and everywhere else.

02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:59.180
But, you know, again, I am not on there because I am not that creative.

02:36:59.180 --> 02:37:01.180
I will watch other people's TikToks.

02:37:01.180 --> 02:37:06.380
I don't think people need to see a TikTok of me screaming at my computer while I'm editing

02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:12.300
over 3000 cosplay videos while holding a bottle, an unmarked bottle of hooch in my hand.

02:37:12.300 --> 02:37:12.800
Okay.

02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:13.980
All right.

02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:15.660
Quickly, what was the other thing you want to talk about tonight?

02:37:18.940 --> 02:37:22.940
You know, I think I might have now three.

02:37:22.940 --> 02:37:23.580
Oh, sure.

02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:32.700
We don't need E3, but in the aspect of we need E3 elaborate.

02:37:33.420 --> 02:37:33.820
Okay.

02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:40.060
So I was traveling yesterday and one of my group chats, people were talking about E3,

02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:42.060
how E3 is useless.

02:37:42.060 --> 02:37:45.900
We don't need E3 because we have packs and this and that.

02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:49.820
I had to stop what I was doing to kind of educate people.

02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:55.500
Now, if I am wrong about E3, please correct me because y'all are the gurus.

02:37:56.940 --> 02:37:58.540
I think I know what you're going to say.

02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:00.540
So please say it, because, yes, I will.

02:38:00.540 --> 02:38:05.340
I will course correct if I if it's not what I think you're going to say.

02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:06.460
Thank you.

02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:13.580
I said to the fellows, people in the chat, E3 is not PAX.

02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:19.980
PAX was kind of created to give the smaller independent publishers and people a voice

02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:21.820
that he did not have it.

02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:27.420
E3 is industrial trade show.

02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:30.940
People in the industry go to E3.

02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:31.740
Correct.

02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:32.540
Yes, you are right.

02:38:33.180 --> 02:38:35.820
E3 is not for the public.

02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:42.220
What you see at PAX, you would see a beta revision at E3.

02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:43.900
There is a difference.

02:38:43.900 --> 02:38:52.620
You let the general person go to E3 and they're playing a beta of so and so game part five.

02:38:53.340 --> 02:38:58.140
That average person is going to go on their socials and bitch about how terrible the game

02:38:58.140 --> 02:39:03.260
is compared to somebody within the industry, whether they're a developer, a creator or

02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:05.180
journalist would explain.

02:39:05.180 --> 02:39:07.180
This is how it looks at this point.

02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:09.420
This is what we're looking forward to towards the end.

02:39:09.420 --> 02:39:09.740
Right.

02:39:09.740 --> 02:39:15.100
And the short way of saying that to your friend is quite simply and succinctly this.

02:39:15.100 --> 02:39:17.820
E3 isn't for you, period.

02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:19.020
That's what it is.

02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:25.420
And yeah, and everything you're saying about people would not be able to put their critical

02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:26.700
eye aside.

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:31.420
And this is why Square Enix, and I remember this when they were showing off, I think I

02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:37.020
played Final Fantasy 13 at E3 and I wanted to get pictures of it, but they would not

02:39:37.020 --> 02:39:38.780
even let you take pictures of the screen.

02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:42.460
Even though they had a demo out there, they did not want people taking pictures of it

02:39:42.460 --> 02:39:43.820
because it wasn't the final product.

02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:45.740
They didn't want people publishing pictures of that.

02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:49.500
That was an early peak is what it was.

02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:54.940
And those were some of the signs that showed that E3 was becoming this other monster

02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:56.940
that it wasn't really ever supposed to be.

02:39:58.940 --> 02:40:04.140
So another thing with E3 said, we're going to let the general public in.

02:40:04.940 --> 02:40:10.940
Do you know how many cosplayers got excited about going to another con to party and have

02:40:10.940 --> 02:40:11.980
a good time?

02:40:11.980 --> 02:40:19.260
I'm just sitting there drinking my tea going, you're going to have a bad time.

02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:20.860
And they're like, why?

02:40:20.860 --> 02:40:26.060
I'm just like, you do realize this is not a three day weekend thing.

02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:31.420
Everything ends around five thirty six o'clock.

02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:35.740
And that's why I say E3 died that year.

02:40:36.700 --> 02:40:41.100
And we've just been running around its corpse like weekend at Bernie's, especially, you

02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:43.180
know, what did I say on Twitter?

02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:49.660
Something like E3 died in twenty seventeen, twenty nineteen and the excuse me, twenty

02:40:49.660 --> 02:40:54.220
twenty in the pandemic and everything killed what was already a corpse, basically.

02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:56.700
And now we've been trying to run it around like weekend at Bernie's.

02:40:56.700 --> 02:40:58.300
And it's just not happening.

02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:00.380
And let's be real.

02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:02.460
Let's be real here.

02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:05.340
Rob, let's not let's not pull any shit right here.

02:41:05.340 --> 02:41:12.060
I don't know about you, but again, when I heard that RePop got their hands on E3, I

02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:15.100
knew it was over right then and there.

02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:20.300
It's that scene from The Simpsons where you say, stop, stop.

02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:21.660
You're killing him already.

02:41:21.660 --> 02:41:27.900
Yeah, I was the same scene with RePop, their hands on it because they were going to turn

02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:29.420
that into another pax.

02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:31.820
And I will testify on that.

02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:33.740
And can I get an amen?

02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:35.740
Well, I hope your audio is coming through now.

02:41:35.740 --> 02:41:40.860
Here's the thing that for me, that when that whole thing went down, that was just more

02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:43.820
like, so this is just further proof.

02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:47.020
The E3 you used to know no longer exists.

02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:51.180
Go back and check the tapes.

02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:53.500
I know that's what I said back then.

02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:56.300
This is already proof that E3 is a different show now.

02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:58.540
It's not the same show you remember from 2006.

02:41:59.260 --> 02:42:04.380
I think also RePop realized, oh, we can't make any money on losses.

02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:05.740
Let's move on.

02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:09.740
Because I think we're kind of at a point where we don't need E3.

02:42:09.740 --> 02:42:12.300
But again, we need something.

02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:18.140
I mean, I don't think the gamers realize how lucky and spoiled they are.

02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:25.260
All of these YouTube reels and live streams this and live streams that 20 years ago.

02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:27.820
Where were we getting our information from?

02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:31.660
The July issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly or GamePro?

02:42:31.660 --> 02:42:38.060
The industry now has Game Developers Conference, and they're very smart to just not invite

02:42:38.060 --> 02:42:40.780
the media to that or in very limited capacity.

02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:46.060
Because this has already happened where people have tried to treat the Game Developers Conference

02:42:46.060 --> 02:42:47.420
as if it was E3.

02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:49.180
They left sorely disappointed.

02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:57.180
And somehow Game Developers Conference for at least the last probably since 2015, 2014

02:42:57.180 --> 02:43:02.220
has managed to exist kind of as an industry game developers event that people don't like

02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:06.140
the consumer and the average gamer, whatever, don't put a lot of stock in.

02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:07.900
And so that's good.

02:43:07.900 --> 02:43:11.580
That's where game developers want their trade show to be.

02:43:11.580 --> 02:43:14.940
So don't let's not spread the word.

02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:22.780
The Game Developers Conference is the new E3, but it's a secret to everyone.

02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:24.780
It's like this.

02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:26.220
The best way I can say it is like this.

02:43:27.020 --> 02:43:30.620
GDC is the science of gaming.

02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:35.900
E3 is where the science becomes magic.

02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:37.340
I see some awesome stuff.

02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:43.500
It might do the magic black smoke and they may close the curtain, but you ain't got to

02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:49.500
worry about it because there is an awesome nerd back there typing away and getting it

02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:52.220
done so that you have an awesome game for Christmas.

02:43:52.220 --> 02:43:53.180
I have a small correction.

02:43:53.180 --> 02:43:57.660
I would say GDC is the science of the industry and all those great things you said.

02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:00.860
E3 is dead.

02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:05.660
That's that's pour it out.

02:44:05.660 --> 02:44:07.820
All right, Rama, I got to let you go so we can wrap up.

02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:09.420
Thank you so much, my friend, for the call.

02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:12.220
I hope everybody will check out Anime Jam Session.

02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:17.980
Lots of great coverage on shows that are for fans, actually, over there on Anime Jam Session.

02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:21.820
Rob, I am offended that you said pour one out.

02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:25.180
I wouldn't pour out a can of Bud Light for E3.

02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:28.400
Ew.

02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:32.220
Point taken.

02:44:33.260 --> 02:44:34.380
Point taken.

02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:35.660
All right, Rama, take care, my friend.

02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:37.580
All right, later, y'all.

02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:38.080
Bye.

02:44:39.020 --> 02:44:39.740
Oh, my God.

02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:40.540
All right.

02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:41.980
That is going to do it for another episode.

02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:45.100
I might have turned up in my mouth a little bit at the mention of Bud Light.

02:44:45.100 --> 02:44:45.420
I know.

02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:46.380
I don't blame you.

02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:48.380
Quickly, quickly, Loki, any last minute stories?

02:44:49.100 --> 02:44:50.540
Yeah, I did have one.

02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:56.460
There is a special offer going on right now through Square Enix where you can download

02:44:57.260 --> 02:45:00.460
Stormblood for free for Final Fantasy 14.

02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:02.940
That promotion doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

02:45:02.940 --> 02:45:04.700
Why not just make it free free?

02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:05.900
It's it's weird.

02:45:05.900 --> 02:45:08.060
It's free until May 28th.

02:45:08.060 --> 02:45:10.140
So if you're interested, go do it.

02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:14.300
But yeah, it's considering getting back into 14.

02:45:14.300 --> 02:45:17.580
But I don't really have any people who play at the time.

02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:18.080
I would.

02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:21.340
I kind of want to get back into Star Trek online.

02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:23.980
Oh, that's a blast to the past.

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:25.340
I love that game so much.

02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:29.260
Just all I did was run around in Deep Space Nine and hang out with Morn.

02:45:31.180 --> 02:45:31.680
All right.

02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:35.100
Well, with that, we're going to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.

02:45:35.100 --> 02:45:37.660
Thank you so much for downloading and checking out Orange Launch Radio.

02:45:37.660 --> 02:45:38.540
We appreciate you all.

02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:41.020
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:42.860
Help us add more voices to the pool.

02:45:43.420 --> 02:45:46.220
Join us live here on Sunday nights over at VOG Network.

02:45:46.220 --> 02:45:48.780
Or if you want, you can also listen to us on the podcast.

02:45:48.780 --> 02:45:53.180
Of course, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is that

02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:55.260
you found this show goes an awful long way.

02:45:56.300 --> 02:45:57.500
We really appreciate all of that.

02:45:57.500 --> 02:46:02.220
Tell a friend, tell an enemy, just tell somebody because actually the show we have been getting

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:05.340
a few more new faces here lately, which has been nice.

02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:07.020
We want more, more.

02:46:07.020 --> 02:46:08.380
So help us.

02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:09.660
We would really appreciate that.

02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:12.620
Let's go give folks final thought.

02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:14.940
Dark Sakura, I know you're off to go do Dead by Daylight.

02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:16.380
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:24.140
Yes, I'm having a subathon on April 19th, and really, it's more of just an excuse to

02:46:24.140 --> 02:46:29.180
have people hang out with me on my birthday who I can't see in person, but it will be

02:46:30.220 --> 02:46:30.780
on my channel.

02:46:30.780 --> 02:46:31.900
I'm playing Dead by Daylight.

02:46:32.140 --> 02:46:37.580
Having a midnight suns and cold to the lamb palate cleanser, but I'm planning on going

02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:40.700
at minimum 18 hours and I'm going to aim for 24.

02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:44.620
There will be appearances by Midna and artwork giveaways.

02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:46.000
All right.

02:46:47.100 --> 02:46:47.580
Oh boy.

02:46:47.580 --> 02:46:47.740
All right.

02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:54.540
So in the meantime, I'm going to play DVD now.

02:46:54.540 --> 02:46:54.940
Bye.

02:46:54.940 --> 02:46:55.180
All right.

02:46:55.180 --> 02:46:55.580
Have fun.

02:46:57.100 --> 02:46:57.580
All right.

02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:59.340
Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.

02:47:00.060 --> 02:47:06.140
I'm just trying to get my content creation down to less than a month between episodes

02:47:06.140 --> 02:47:06.940
of things.

02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:08.220
So good call.

02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:12.860
It helps to be able to get more videos out and spreading the word.

02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:13.500
That's for sure.

02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:14.060
Yes.

02:47:14.060 --> 02:47:17.740
So that's why starting yet another series is a great idea.

02:47:17.740 --> 02:47:18.460
Yeah, good call.

02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:21.260
My final thought tonight.

02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:22.380
I don't have a lot.

02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:25.180
My life outside of the show has been pretty busy.

02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:27.260
Can't talk about that right now.

02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:28.780
I'll talk about it in a week or two.

02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:30.380
It's nothing to do with OLR gaming.

02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:31.740
It's just interesting stuff.

02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:35.900
So I'll talk about that in a couple of weeks, but otherwise, that's it.

02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:38.300
I hope everybody is doing well and great.

02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:42.140
Looking forward to getting back to some conventions, things like Dragon Con.

02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:46.540
Looking forward to hoping to meet some people over Labor Day and check out some events here

02:47:46.540 --> 02:47:47.260
locally, too.

02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:51.660
I think we're supposed to go to one in mid April, so I'm supposed to more info on that

02:47:51.660 --> 02:47:52.140
next week.

02:47:52.140 --> 02:47:54.060
Maybe I got to get all the details on that.

02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:55.580
So anyway, that's it.

02:47:55.580 --> 02:47:55.980
We're done.

02:47:55.980 --> 02:47:56.780
We're out of here for the night.

02:47:56.780 --> 02:47:57.900
Have a great night, everybody.

02:47:57.900 --> 02:47:59.340
We will see you in seven days.

02:47:59.340 --> 02:48:00.940
We'll do this all over again.

02:48:00.940 --> 02:48:02.220
I can't wait to see you.

02:48:02.220 --> 02:48:03.020
Until next time.

02:48:03.820 --> 02:48:04.300
Bye bye.

02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:44.860
See you next week.
