Since the loss of ThinkGeek, there's been a void of great geek April Fools, especially for anything that could be feasibly tangible. Hats off to the Sonic social team for having a dream as completely off the beaten and expected paths as it was, and congratulations on making it happen. The reaction to the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has been wonderful to see, the commentary has been amazing, and it's always a treat to start April in smiles and fascination rather than not.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,480
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again, with episode number 955 of our show for tonight, April the 9th of 2023.

3
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,560
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined, as always, by my co host. Say hello first and foremost to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

4
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,600
Jamie Summers Hey.

5
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,800
Hi, how are you doing?

6
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,440
Jamie Summers I'm okay.

7
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:10,920
Rob Roberts Yeah?

8
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
Jamie Summers My- I've been doing new things with my body.

9
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,360
Rob Roberts Now, now this is a family show.

10
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,440
Jamie Summers It's clean.

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,480
Rob Roberts Okay, what kinds of things?

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:36,320
Jamie Summers Well, I've gotten back, I can now lift some weights again. I do yoga practically every day now. And I'm starting basic ballet.

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,480
Rob Roberts Oh, wow. Okay. It's very artistic. I love that.

14
00:01:41,240 --> 00:02:04,960
Jamie Summers Well, I have to have a bar and I found some courses that teach online. And now I have mad respect for, for dancers. Just just try to go from a first position demi plié into elevé and do that 20 times.

15
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,280
Rob Roberts Will I be seeing you in next year's production of The Nutcracker?

16
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,720
Jamie Summers No. But apparently, Queer Jesus just followed me. So I'm following them back.

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
Rob Roberts Well, it's a good day for that.

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:38,360
Jamie Summers But at any rate, it's, it's all this attempt I'm doing to try to get the range of motion back in my in my hips since I have arthritis. And I'm doing so much stuff now that now my back actually starts hurting if I don't maintain good posture.

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:50,560
Jamie Summers So, um, but I'm, I'm, I'm trying to get myself stronger, get myself geared up. And of course, there's all the prep work for the event on my birthday.

20
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,120
Rob Roberts Getting old is fun. Is the lesson learned there?

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,920
Jamie Summers No, it's not old. Older.

22
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,680
Rob Roberts Old. Okay, yes. Older.

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,720
Jamie Summers We're older every day. Old is not. It doesn't mean anything.

24
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,520
Rob Roberts I'm older now than I was when the show started.

25
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:20,360
Jamie Summers Everyone is. But old doesn't mean anything anymore. It's, it's a state of being and not a number on the calendar.

26
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,800
Rob Roberts All right. Well, also say hello to somebody. I don't know if he's going to be signing up for ballerina classes anytime soon. But you never know. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

27
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,880
No, I will not be doing that.

28
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,800
Jamie Summers You know what, you don't need to improve your posture. Like I, I think I do.

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,720
Rob Roberts No, I absolutely do. But that will be not that that's not the method I'll be using to improve my posture.

30
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,320
Jamie Summers You could start by actually playing that Dance Dance Revolution machine in your garage.

31
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:59,320
Rob Roberts You know, actually, funny. Yeah. Funny you mentioned that. Yeah, I should do that. I earlier this week, I was like, man, I need to go out there and like, just hook everything back up again, because it's broken PC.

32
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:10,640
Jamie Summers I don't know if you went outside today, but it's like, oh, shit. Summer just showed up all of a sudden. It's not that bad. But I was like, I did. Yeah, we had our week long transition. Spring happened and now it's summer. So yeah.

33
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:27,720
Jamie Summers sj100matt in our chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show. sj100matt in chat says I mean, DDR does have a bar. So

34
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Jamie Summers it's a difference between a bar and a bar. There is B a r r e.

35
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:52,200
Jamie Summers And for the record, I'm not planning on going out and actually being a dancer. I just want to learn the techniques and, and have the benefit of it. I'm not an in person performer performer unless it's like musical instruments or whatever.

36
00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:01,320
Jamie Summers And it's not for everybody. It just happened to be the thing that has really done wonders for my mobility.

37
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:21,840
Jamie Tworkowski There's, there's, you're not going to appreciate this comparison. I'm sorry, but it's the first thing that comes to mind. But I'm very familiar with a lot of ladies and guys too and theys that have done pole dancing classes for very similar reasons. It's not that they ever really intend to use it. But it's that same type of, you know, yeah.

38
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:47,160
Jamie Tworkowski In comparison, I actually found video of ballerina pole dancers. By training usually a ballerina is going to have stronger legs than upper body. And a pole dancer is going to have a stronger upper body. So put the two together and you're seeing musculature that belongs on She-Hulk doing things on a pole I never thought were possible.

39
00:05:47,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Jamie Tworkowski For my birthday once, a friend, well, sadly, a former friend, but still at the time, it was very nice gesture, did a free like comp pole dancing class for me and a few friends. And I remember Extafur was there as well.

40
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Jamie Tworkowski Yeah, it was, you know, like I said, it was a different time. But at the time, we had a great time and Extafur was very good at pole dancing as it turns out.

41
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,280
Brandon Zemp You answered your question, Darksack, right? Yes, there was a pole dance hero. It was an adult swimming web game.

42
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,520
Jamie Tworkowski Oh shit. Why have I not played this?

43
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:38,520
And DJ Rama S in our chat says there is a pole dancing anime coming out later this year called Pole Princess. Well, I guess the name Pole Position was taken.

44
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Brandon Zemp Yeah, I was gonna say I want to see the anime with pole dancing, you know, race cars, pole position. Hell yes.

45
00:06:45,200 --> 00:07:10,160
All right, sorry to take your joke. All right, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about something admittedly I have yet to see. But the reality is a lot of you have seen it. And I mean, a lot of you have seen it. And it is the Super Mario Brothers movie, which, of course, was released into theaters this weekend. I did not get around to seeing it this weekend. I don't think, Darksack, I don't think you did. I remember

46
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,920
I have not. Yeah, I'm actually considering going to see on like a Tuesday mat.

47
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,960
That's where I'm at. I kind of like I'll find a weeknight I can go.

48
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,120
Yeah, but I still have other stuff I'd rather see.

49
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,680
Loki, you did see it.

50
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,760
I mean, honestly, like if you're gonna go to the movie. Yeah, it was it was good.

51
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,320
You want to see it again? You want to see it again? That's what you're gonna say, huh?

52
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,320
No, no, no, no.

53
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,440
So so I was actually I was talking about this earlier to my sister, so

54
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,760
they were talking about like the Dungeons and Dragons movie and Mario.

55
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,920
And I was like, if someone asked me, hey.

56
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,400
Let's go see one of those two movies again this week or something like that.

57
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,440
I picked the Dungeons and Dragons movie.

58
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,440
OK, that's not to say that the the Super Mario movie wasn't good.

59
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,640
It was good. I liked it.

60
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,040
I think it's kind of just your run of the mill, like.

61
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,240
Illumination movie, I guess it's not bad.

62
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,920
It's just not like it wasn't hilarious.

63
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,520
It wasn't like super funny or anything.

64
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,240
It was just it was satisfying.

65
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,200
It was satisfying to watch.

66
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,080
Is it something I need to see like right away again?

67
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,320
I mean, maybe if I want to pick up like on some of the background

68
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,200
like Easter eggs and stuff like that a little bit more than what I did.

69
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,680
But Dungeons and Dragons was funny,

70
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
like I actually laughed out loud at a bunch of stuff in that.

71
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,760
That's a great movie.

72
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,800
Like that, I would see again,

73
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,760
and I'm very excited to see what they do with that humor.

74
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,680
But like, honestly, both are good.

75
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,840
I'm sure a lot of your gaming podcasts that you all listen to out there

76
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,840
are going to be talking a little bit in depth about their impressions

77
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,120
or reviews of the movie, and that's great.

78
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,160
So I suppose I should allow Loki a little bit of space

79
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,680
without spoiling anything, obviously, because not only have you

80
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
and Dark Soccer and I not seen it, but I'm sure there's people listening in chat.

81
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,880
So obviously gags, specifics in the gags aside,

82
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,680
what were kind of just, I guess, your general thoughts on the movie?

83
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,960
I mean, you kind of started to go there.

84
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,520
You talk about that it was satisfying, but like, you know,

85
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,720
were you kind of did you see like opportunities

86
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,000
they needed to take advantage of that weren't there? Was it?

87
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,160
Yeah, the opportunity they should have taken advantage of.

88
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Don't show the whole movie in your trailers.

89
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,360
That's number one, because there's a lot of stuff that would have been

90
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,120
more impactful had they not shown it in their trailers.

91
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
And yeah, I was excited about the movie.

92
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,400
So I watched the trailers and the TV spots and all that stuff.

93
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,160
But they showed a lot of the movie,

94
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,920
like a lot of the big stuff that was in there. Yeah.

95
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,760
So there wasn't like any surprises, kind of.

96
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,120
And I think that's what kind of made it not as good as it could have been,

97
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,920
is because, you know, all of that surprise was kind of thrown out the window.

98
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,280
You know, generally, I mean, plot wise, funny,

99
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,640
you know, it sort of kind of reminds me a little bit of the the 90s

100
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,120
Mario movie in a sense, like there's a part at the end

101
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,600
that is like what what they were trying to do in the 90s movie.

102
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,720
But then they actually did it in this one. But then

103
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
I don't know, like there's a lot of like

104
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,520
Easter egg stuff in there, like obviously, you know, the DK rap,

105
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,840
like the Mario Brothers,

106
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,120
you know, TV show theme, which you saw in the commercial again.

107
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,920
Once again, there's all that stuff and there are lots of music things.

108
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Rob was right again about, you know, who Charles Martinet played, obviously.

109
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,960
I won't remind you, but go check the tapes on that episode.

110
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,760
I told you exactly what his role would be.

111
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,320
And it turns out, just add that to the scoreboard.

112
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,360
Yeah, I heard he actually has two characters, but.

113
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,720
But yeah, it still was.

114
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,680
Yeah, I mean, so it made sense.

115
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,040
I mean, I don't know, I think it was pretty good.

116
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,680
It's just it's one of the things, though, it's like, I'm

117
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,640
am I like super pumped for like when the next movie comes out?

118
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Yeah, I'll see it.

119
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,480
I'm not like, you know, really, really excited.

120
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,240
Probably this time would be I would try to avoid the trailers

121
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,560
because apparently illumination, the folks behind that,

122
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,320
they have no self-control when it comes to showing everything from the movies.

123
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,400
So I would just say that going forward, you know, if you want, you know.

124
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,120
That's why in our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord,

125
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,160
you know, Tiger Claw posts a lot of that movie hype.

126
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,120
This is not a read.

127
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,800
I get it.

128
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,880
Everybody gets into movies different ways.

129
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,360
And some people really want to, you know, consume all that and get in the hype.

130
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,080
So when it's something that, you know, I'm going to pick on Tiger Claw

131
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,320
a little bit since I am the Sonic, the Ninja Turtles and that whole

132
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
sorts of things that he's into.

133
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,960
He'll post every single little commercial spot that comes up.

134
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,840
And some people do want to see that and like buy into that hype.

135
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,520
And it's almost like you're drip feeding some of that movie.

136
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,000
So I get it. But we did build him essentially his own channel

137
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
so that people who don't want to consume all that.

138
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,840
Can stay out, you know what I mean?

139
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,120
So everybody has it.

140
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,360
There's no right or wrong way.

141
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,960
Everybody has their different levels of fandom.

142
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
And some some people when it comes to certain movies,

143
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,720
like they don't want to know a goddamn thing about it when they go in there.

144
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,480
And honestly, some movies are better

145
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,640
when you don't know a single thing going into it.

146
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,760
So, you know, it's just I think the writing could have been better

147
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,600
probably in the movie.

148
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,240
Like, it's funny, like because illumination movies, I don't like

149
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,360
see them as a negative thing, even like the movies are fine.

150
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,120
Like, sure, the characters are somewhat annoying, but that's by the

151
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,240
I can't stand the minion stuff, but I get it.

152
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,400
Like I get it. Yeah.

153
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,840
Look at the other stuff like around it.

154
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,400
Like I remember, like, for example, it's a really weird comparison, but like

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,440
The Secret Life of Pets, like the beginning of that movie, they play.

156
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,800
I remember at the song school, but it's like New York is the name of the song.

157
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,320
And it's just like shots of like Central Park and stuff like that.

158
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,800
But it's done so stylistically that it's just like really impactful

159
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,760
or like sing sing is another one that they do.

160
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,160
Like, it's a really like impactful moments in in that

161
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,240
those movies this didn't have that.

162
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,800
Like, it's just not like the heart is kind of missing in some of the stuff.

163
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,280
Now to say like Chris Pratt did a fine job.

164
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,680
I am totally fine with that.

165
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,520
In fact, it's funny because now that the movies come out, people are like, Whoa,

166
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,000
that Rogan didn't do a good job.

167
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's like, who cares?

168
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,840
Like, honestly, none of that detracted from the movie at all.

169
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,200
It's just there's not much plot there.

170
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,240
They hinted at things that.

171
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,800
They didn't address in this movie

172
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,080
that are probably being the next one or something,

173
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,400
but there's just not a lot of plot.

174
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean, it's kind of.

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,720
I don't know, like it like how

176
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,840
how Mario gets to the Mushroom Kingdom is just kind of throwaway.

177
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,360
Like, I mean, it's about it's about like kind of

178
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,400
it's kind of what the 90s movie did.

179
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,840
Honestly, it's it's very similar.

180
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,560
Yeah. Do the games actually have a real plot?

181
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
No, I don't think they do.

182
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,080
And that's the thing.

183
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,720
Bowser's done interesting,

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,200
which it makes more sense when you look at like Odyssey and stuff.

185
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,920
It's very similar to that.

186
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,640
There's a lot of like a lot of Easter eggs and like things

187
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,280
from the Mario games and the movies and stuff are not movies,

188
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,400
but like just the games themselves, a lot of stuff taken straight out of that.

189
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,480
The Mario Kart thing just felt really like just out of nowhere.

190
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,160
I mean, it was fine. It was cool.

191
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,600
I mean, it's just I don't know.

192
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,200
I think they could have had better writers is what they they probably needed.

193
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,760
But like, yeah, illumination.

194
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,520
No, it's not bad when I go see the next one.

195
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,920
Absolutely. Day one again.

196
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,400
But like, it's just when you compare it to like Dungeons and Dragons,

197
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
which was thoroughly entertaining.

198
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,360
And I don't play a lot.

199
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,160
I played D&D like way back in the day.

200
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,800
But I'm like, not certainly a D&D aficionado or anything like that.

201
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,880
That movie is just very entertaining on its own.

202
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,080
And you have the writers that thank for that.

203
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,960
One question. Do they mention THAC0 at all?

204
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,200
I don't think so.

205
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,880
Darn. Maybe in the sequel.

206
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,080
All right, well, speak of his sequel.

207
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,680
So even though Loki gave a, you know, kind of a is all right type of review there.

208
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,560
And I'm kind of where I'm like, OK, I'm assuming

209
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,520
it's not going to be the most amazing Oscar winning plot here.

210
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,600
But as long as there's lots of Easter eggs and things that made me go,

211
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,880
I get that, like, which it sounds like there's a lot.

212
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,040
There's a lot of music.

213
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
I'll be fine. Yeah.

214
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
So lots of music stuff that's in there.

215
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,560
That's like because it's all the orchestra takes on those.

216
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,120
And it's like, oh, yeah.

217
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, so then like so much nostalgia stuff.

218
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,120
Like it's good in that sense.

219
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,080
And like I like I said, I don't want to say like I didn't enjoy it.

220
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,720
Like I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

221
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,240
It's just not like one of those movies, like,

222
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,960
you know, Tron Legacy, where it's like, oh, man, I got to go.

223
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,720
I got to watch. Yeah, yeah.

224
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,280
Right now, that type of thing in IMAX.

225
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,920
I know it's not like that.

226
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,360
I don't really want to go to Florida, but if I'm going to go to Florida,

227
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,040
I guess I'll get my money to Disney and go ride that new Tron ride

228
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,640
because I really want to.

229
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,520
Let's just put it that way.

230
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,920
One of the hosts of a podcast I'm really fond of stuff you missed in history

231
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,040
got to go on it early and said that it was every bit as amazing

232
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,160
as one thinks it is.

233
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,880
I heard a lot of the electronica stuff

234
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,840
moved over there, too, that they they had it.

235
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,440
But anyway, that's another topic.

236
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,200
I want to go back to the Mario movie.

237
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,400
And even though across the board from critics getting kind of mad reviews,

238
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,520
that doesn't matter what matters box office.

239
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,320
And let's take a look at a report from Variety.

240
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,440
OK, so Variety is like a Hollywood industry type of magazine, right?

241
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,960
And Variety is talking

242
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,600
Super Mario Brothers movie barrels to a record two hundred

243
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,280
and four million debut.

244
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,680
And it talks about that the movie made two hundred

245
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,600
and four point six million in its first five days of release.

246
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,680
Some of you may be looking at a different number that's three hundred million.

247
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,800
You're looking at global versus US.

248
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,920
This is still a huge number for the US, that is for sure.

249
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,160
This is now the biggest opening weekend of the year.

250
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,920
Ant-Man and the Wasp was the prior record holder with about half

251
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,600
that one hundred and six million.

252
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,560
It is the second biggest debut ever for an animated title.

253
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,880
It outgrows Finding Dory from 2016,

254
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,600
at least for opening weekend, as far as it goes.

255
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,880
We go on to talk about another one hundred

256
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,080
seventy three million from the International Box Office.

257
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,920
Three hundred and seventy seven million worldwide.

258
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,000
That's off of a one hundred million dollar production budget.

259
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,360
It was expected to collect eighty six million over the weekend.

260
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,440
And one hundred and twenty five in its first five days of release.

261
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,280
So this is a better than expected turnout for this movie.

262
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,320
And I got to say, I think this is this is going to be huge

263
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,560
for our video games going to movies.

264
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,360
And just like we were already going this direction, right?

265
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,440
You know, video games have been slowly taking over media,

266
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,320
you know, especially ever since The Witcher did very well on Netflix,

267
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
which, yes, I know is a book, but come on.

268
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,440
It was the video games that, you know, was was really pushing that and so forth.

269
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,720
And then, you know, you had the Castlevania anime.

270
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,360
And then, you know, then you had all this stuff that happened

271
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,080
on the Netflix side of things and all the streaming services.

272
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,360
And then Resident Evil, they have the Resident Evil series.

273
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,360
Well, it didn't go too well because it's canceled.

274
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,240
No, I'm not talking about the live action anime. Yeah.

275
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,400
Yeah, I really liked Degeneration.

276
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
Resident Evil Degeneration was such a good watch.

277
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, the live action, yeah.

278
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,240
But and it had

279
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,760
Anatsuchia on the soundtrack, so that was great.

280
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,640
But now, as far as, you know, 2023 goes,

281
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,760
you've got that one, two punch of The Last of Us on HBO.

282
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,000
Obviously, a very different kind of thing than Super Mario Brothers.

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
But this is this is huge.

284
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,320
Like you're going to see a ton of video game stuff get green lit real soon.

285
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
A sequel happening to this movie.

286
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,480
Any anybody could call that that is 100 percent happening at this point.

287
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,760
There'll be a sequel to Super Mario Brothers.

288
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,720
I'm sure it was set up for plenty of them.

289
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,480
Yeah. Yeah. So that that's going to happen for sure.

290
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
Not a question.

291
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,720
But now the question is, how much does Nintendo start to go? Oh.

292
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,440
We should have maybe started to let go of some of our IPs some time ago.

293
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,360
I understand the 90s Mario movie bombed.

294
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,320
It wasn't received well, although it's interesting.

295
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,520
There's been some interesting look back pieces in light of this new movie.

296
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,360
And it's interesting to kind of read about what they were really going for

297
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,080
with the 90s movie and some of the places that they went wrong.

298
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,880
But here's what it was at the end of the day with the 90s Mario movie.

299
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,360
And quite honestly, a lot of video game stuff we got in the 90s.

300
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,880
The original Street Fighter movie, the Mortal Combat movies and so forth.

301
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,520
A lot of those things were brought to you by people who didn't play the games.

302
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,520
Or they knew a little bit of them or whatever.

303
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,200
The Halo series.

304
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,960
There's a reason I left that out for my earlier.

305
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,840
But anyway, but you get there's also now people now that it's a different generation, right?

306
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,640
Now that it's 2020s, as opposed to the 1990s, we're 30 years later.

307
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,480
And the people that are making movies now are the people that grew up with this stuff.

308
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:23,840
And they're making the movies that, you know, are more in line with what we wanted to see way back then.

309
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,280
Sorry, Bobby. Yes, it was. Do the math.

310
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,720
It was that long ago.

311
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,640
Seriously, you know, just like look at like the Sonic the Hedgehog movie

312
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,240
and like what trash that originally would start out as.

313
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,160
Like, who would have thought that like that would have been that good?

314
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,800
Like, you know, or even the sequel.

315
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,200
Well, and I'm glad you brought up the Sonic movies, because honestly,

316
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,240
that was also really the start of this whole recent wave.

317
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,840
Really, I think the pandemic kind of threw things off a little bit.

318
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,200
But I think Sonic doing well was certainly something that added to,

319
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,720
you know, what we see with the Mario movie and so forth.

320
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,960
So, loony barred in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, to be fair,

321
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,200
the original Mario movie is kind of a so bad it's hilarious thing.

322
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,920
Oh, yeah, now it is.

323
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,600
So but so is 90s classics such as Showgirls and stuff.

324
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,400
There's there's movies age differently.

325
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,360
I would recommend, though, that for the Mario movie,

326
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,480
there are a few really good documentaries

327
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,320
about what it was intended to be with, like original

328
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,480
storyboards and whatnot.

329
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,160
And it could have been a really good movie.

330
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,960
It really could have.

331
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,480
And it got fucked over and it was being rewritten while the movie was being.

332
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,800
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Of course, then again, Xanadu was too, but Xanadu was perfection.

334
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,360
But I don't.

335
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,000
There's a lot of movie critics that would not agree with you, Jamie,

336
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,720
but it doesn't matter.

337
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,520
They're wrong to hell with what critics think.

338
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,280
It's what about you? It's what you think, right?

339
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,600
Well, you know, for the record, Olivia Newton-John said that

340
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,200
that was her favorite movie to shoot because she got to dance with Gene Kelly.

341
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,840
And my favorite horror movie of all time is Elvira,

342
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,280
Mistress of the Dark, and I will never change that answer.

343
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,720
I don't care what.

344
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,560
So you know what else we have coming out this year, which they put out

345
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,600
the first green shot from is the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.

346
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,800
Oh, yeah, because they're opening that.

347
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,360
They're opening that the same weekend as the Saw revival or whatever

348
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,680
they're doing with that franchise.

349
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,720
Yeah, Saw X or X.

350
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,520
I don't I don't know with a movie like that.

351
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,080
You don't know is it is it meant to be called X like Mortal

352
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,280
Kombat was or is it Saw X? I don't know.

353
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,800
Yeah, it's October 27th.

354
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,080
And my thing that I'm most excited about is the Jim Henson companies

355
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,920
doing the animatronics for they're doing all the puppets and everything.

356
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,080
So it's fun. It's going to look good.

357
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,680
Like, I'm not even really a huge fan of Five Nights at Freddy's,

358
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,520
but like, I just like the concept of that.

359
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,480
Like, I'd absolutely go see that.

360
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,400
You know, it's funny because there's a lot of people on the Internet

361
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,880
and things I'm seeing on social media that like it's it's foolish

362
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,400
for Five Nights at Freddy's to open the same weekend as Saw.

363
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,800
Like it's got to go.

364
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
I think the reverse is true.

365
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,400
I think the reverse is totally true.

366
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,320
I think Saw needs to run because they're look, those types of horror

367
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,080
movies have their crowd, but the the do not underestimate

368
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,920
how the kids identify like there's going to be so many kids

369
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
that want to see that movie, whether they should be or not.

370
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,160
But I would say it's I'm going to guess what it's going to probably go

371
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,000
for PG 13, right? And probably I would guess your oldest is getting

372
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,680
pretty close to 13, isn't he?

373
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,000
I feel like time will be 13 by the time the movie. Oh, my God.

374
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,560
So I mean, like, but your your oldest is like exactly

375
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,920
who I'm thinking of who's going to carry that Five Nights movie.

376
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,960
Like his, you know, 13 year olds are going to want to see that movie.

377
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,800
And ironically, he probably doesn't care about the movie at all.

378
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,640
That's fine, but it'll be good.

379
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,160
Like, I think it'll be good

380
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,280
if it all has to do is beat Willy's Wonderland

381
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,840
and Willy's Wonderland is pretty amazing.

382
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,680
But just because Nicolas Cage is in there.

383
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,000
But like, hey, you know what?

384
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,280
There's always room for the Five Nights at Freddy's sequel

385
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,680
to have Nicolas Cage in it.

386
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,120
But they've got Matthew Lillard in there.

387
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,840
So like, I love Matthew Lillard.

388
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,800
So I. I mean, I can't wait.

389
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,480
It's going to be awesome.

390
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,000
I wouldn't want to see it unless it was rated R.

391
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,080
Oh, yeah, we'll see.

392
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,480
I don't know. It might be violent. Who knows?

393
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,600
You rated R, I'll go see it.

394
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,280
I would say best case scenario, you get a Megan situation

395
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,880
where it's PG 13 in the theaters and then there's like an uncut one

396
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,200
that they release the best case scenario.

397
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,760
I think that's what you get.

398
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,360
I need to see that. I still need to see that movie.

399
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,160
Oh, Megan. Yeah, so good. It's so good.

400
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm kind of disappointed that Mario outgrossed it.

401
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,720
No, I'm kidding. It's completely expected.

402
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,240
All right. But let's talk about some other movies that are coming.

403
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,000
This one was probably already in talks before the Mario thing happened.

404
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,360
But this really solidifies it.

405
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,560
Honestly, legendary entertainment who brought us

406
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
some really big franchises as of late.

407
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,760
Jurassic World, Pokemon, Detective Pikachu, Dune, Godzilla vs.

408
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,000
Kong, Kong, Kong.

409
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,360
They have purchased the film and TV rights to Street Fighter.

410
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,320
Obviously, the Capcom franchise.

411
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,160
This is reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

412
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,200
This means any and all future projects, meaning streaming series,

413
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,840
anime, live action movies, all of it.

414
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,040
And Capcom actually went so far as to confirm

415
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,560
a new movie is in the works at Legendary.

416
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,000
In a tweet at Street Fighter wrote a new live action

417
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,120
Street Fighter movie is in the works, co-produced by Legendary

418
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,640
Entertainment and Capcom.

419
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,400
More news to come in the future.

420
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,760
So obviously that is all we know for now.

421
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,400
But, you know, very interesting.

422
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,840
Well, we just got a Mortal Kombat reboot a few years ago.

423
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,000
But, you know, the Street Fighter reboot, it's

424
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,560
it's not going to look anything like the 90s movie.

425
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,600
Like we have to get that out of our head.

426
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,000
Let's not forget, though, that there also was a 2000s movie.

427
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
There was. There was.

428
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,280
It was not good. Somehow worse.

429
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,760
It seems like it should be, you know, very significant news.

430
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,600
But for me, it's just a Tuesday.

431
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,920
Tiger Claw and Chat says what you did there. Funny.

432
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,960
Tiger Claw and Chat says Street Fighter is going to be tricky to adapt.

433
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,240
They already did it twice, and it still couldn't capture the magic of the games.

434
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,200
I there's actually a third adaptation live action called Street Fighter

435
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,560
Assassin's Fist, and it's I've I've started watching it

436
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,760
actually about a week or so ago.

437
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,400
It's actually not too bad.

438
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,360
It's a web series.

439
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,200
And the the whole thing was already compiled and put up in full on YouTube.

440
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,960
And it's it's pretty good.

441
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:37,640
The the style is like IRL cosplay outfit type.

442
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,480
Like they try to mimic the game with how they look very alpha.

443
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,560
But it's it's really good.

444
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm really enjoying enjoying it so far.

445
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,760
A lot better than the other two live action attempts.

446
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,680
But as far as this goes, it's all out the window. It doesn't matter.

447
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,800
They're going to start from scratch.

448
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,720
There's not going to be any references to any of this older stuff.

449
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,080
Maybe if you're lucky, you get either a nod to Raul Julia,

450
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,880
which I think you'd see that like maybe a painting of him or something

451
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,160
that's in the background in a scene.

452
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,560
You see like you'll see something like that

453
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,400
or that the Tuesday line will somehow sneak its way into the movie.

454
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
That's that's it. That's all you're going to get.

455
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm saying it now, Kylie Minogue.

456
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,520
Hell yeah, I would take Kylie Minogue as Kami or even a little amazing.

457
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,600
She could she could even cameo as like the head of British intelligence

458
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
or whatever, you know, whatever Kami comes from.

459
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,440
You know, the reason she was in it,

460
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,240
you know, the reason why she was in that movie to begin with is because

461
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,040
they filmed the first part of it in Thailand and then

462
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,240
they had to leave due to expenses and film the rest of it in Australia.

463
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,240
And they needed an Australian actor.

464
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,640
Oh, how funny.

465
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
And I'll go ahead and repeat what I said before the show,

466
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,920
that Sawada's character was because the actor I need

467
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,680
I don't remember his given name, but I know his name is Sawada.

468
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,800
They wanted him to play for you, but they had already cast for you.

469
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,440
So they basically made

470
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,760
they made a character for him and everyone loves him because he's amazing.

471
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,600
Yeah, at least he's more loved than Cole.

472
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,160
The reason why there are not as at the time as well-known actors in it

473
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,680
was because it put all of their hiring budget into getting Jean-Claude Van Damme.

474
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,880
Hmm. OK, bring him back.

475
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,760
It's Colonel Guile. He could still do it.

476
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,120
Nobody from the older movies is coming back.

477
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,680
Maybe a cameo, but that's it.

478
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,000
Have Jean-Claude Van Damme play Bison.

479
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,960
No, Jean-Claude Van Damme is going to be nowhere near this movie.

480
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,880
Or wait, no, bring him back as a really angry, grizzled Rolento.

481
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,240
No, they don't they don't want ties to the old stuff.

482
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,920
This is going to be brand new.

483
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,000
I know, I know. But I could totally see him playing Rolento now.

484
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,680
I'm curious if they adapt Street Fighter II,

485
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,880
which is kind of like the most well known with those characters,

486
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,280
or if they start to incorporate, you know, more expanded universe,

487
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,800
because they're really just the mainline universe.

488
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,720
I'm talking about the rosters for four or five and soon to be six.

489
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,960
If we start to see some of those characters come into play,

490
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,040
or if it's if like they do two first and then if it does well,

491
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,240
maybe we'll see some of those more expanded roster characters in a sequel.

492
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,640
I don't know. I don't know.

493
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,080
This is going to come from a different creative team who grew up with it.

494
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,160
It's not it's going to be better.

495
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,240
It has to be. It has to be.

496
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,040
It can't be worse than the Chun-Li movie.

497
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,600
So anyway, but there are some good names in that that first live action movie.

498
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,480
Oh, no, there were.

499
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,120
Yeah, West Duty and I mean, some pretty amazing people.

500
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
And we had the future Leatherface.

501
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,840
Mm hmm. He played Zangief.

502
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah, we had a lot of, you know, for the time, big names in that movie.

503
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,160
And somebody in chat had said to kind of that that trivia fact that, oh,

504
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,920
Julia only did that movie because his grandkids wanted him to.

505
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,800
And he did it like a favor to them.

506
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,680
And he was also ridiculously sick.

507
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,800
Yeah. So the reason that everyone was supposed to go through weeks

508
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,000
of of martial arts training while he filmed his scenes first.

509
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,560
But he was so sick that they actually had to have

510
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,240
everyone do their scenes while he recovered.

511
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,680
And he was like the outfit that he wore was simply

512
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,680
to hide just how thin he had become.

513
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
Well, he's he's the reason to see that movie if, you know,

514
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,920
to put as much as there are other interesting actors and actresses.

515
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,880
Every movie he's in. Yeah.

516
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,840
But anyway, it's such a good villain.

517
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,160
Back to the Mario and you know what this is going to mean for the future.

518
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,400
I wonder now, because obviously the 90s movie and that whole experience

519
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,120
scared Nintendo away from making movies based off their IP for a very long time,

520
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,960
save the occasional maybe like anime because there was like an animal crossing thing.

521
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,000
Right. So very rare sort of thing.

522
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,840
I'm very curious to see if they start to green light

523
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,680
some more of their stuff to become movies.

524
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,080
And I, I really do think the success of this movie means in the next five years,

525
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,520
we're going to get that holy grail of video game adaptations.

526
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,320
Everyone's what everyone wants.

527
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
And that's The Legend of Zelda as a movie.

528
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,440
I have no idea how they tackle it.

529
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,560
What game they try to go for, if it would be a Breath of the Wild or it doesn't really matter.

530
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,680
But I think Zelda becomes a movie in the next five years based off the success of Mario.

531
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,560
It has to. It has to.

532
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,360
Anyway, it'd be interesting to see what develops, but I'm looking forward to seeing

533
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,800
the Mario movie at some point and catching all those references, that's for sure.

534
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,320
All right, let's move on.

535
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,280
We got to get into more news this week and our gaming weeks.

536
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,200
Yeah, one thing before that, though.

537
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,360
Yeah, because I was asked to say so.

538
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,320
Remember, I messaged you.

539
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,360
We have a message from Sturlock.

540
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,080
He lost his dad this morning very suddenly.

541
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,600
And he said to not take the ones you love for granted.

542
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,000
And I think that everyone needs to find

543
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,840
the people that they care about in their lives and tell them so.

544
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,760
Well, very sorry to hear that news, Sturlock, but we're all thinking of you.

545
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,160
And your family, both biological and chosen at this time.

546
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,120
So sending love.

547
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,680
All right. Well, hard to transition from that.

548
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,560
But let's do what we usually do and talk about our gaming weeks

549
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,280
and the types of video games we've been playing this week.

550
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,680
So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

551
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,640
It was kind of the usual.

552
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,280
I played more Beatlemania Pinball, which we are going to be buying it.

553
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,920
Oh, you are. OK, we are

554
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,440
probably going to do a trade and a buy.

555
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,800
And but I freaking love it.

556
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,040
I love it. I sing along with it, which is funny

557
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,560
because it's not even my favorite era of Beatles.

558
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,520
And then I played Marvel Midnight Suns.

559
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,560
I'm actually going to be doing that

560
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,800
instead of my retro night through the end of the month, because I've

561
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,840
I've been feeling that a little bit more lately, and I need to get my brain

562
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,800
back into the mindset for Star Ocean.

563
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,000
I've been playing

564
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,640
I actually bought Meet Your Maker for the cosmetics,

565
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,160
but I played it before.

566
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,800
But I'm definitely going to try to give the game another another shot.

567
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,560
Of course, I'm playing Dead by Daylight.

568
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,680
I hit Eerie One again for Survivor.

569
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,920
I guess I'm a Survivor main now.

570
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,720
What's wrong with me, Rob? What's wrong with me?

571
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,240
You have your own little squad that you run with now,

572
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,120
and when you play killer, you don't get to play with your friends.

573
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,240
So it's I mean, that's the big thing that change.

574
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,560
Go back and build my skills back up for my adepts,

575
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,880
which I will be working on a little bit on the 19th

576
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,480
on my my my birthday party on my channel.

577
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,280
It is not your fault, Gwen.

578
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm going to tell you this right now.

579
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,920
You helped me because I wanted cosmetics.

580
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,160
It's the cosmetic addict's fault.

581
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,600
You you facilitated it,

582
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,360
but I wanted the the cosmetics.

583
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,600
I'm going to I'm going to give Gwen some big credit because she's been with you

584
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,080
from the very beginning when streaming Survivor and so forth.

585
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,160
She's been she's been the the I don't know, the

586
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,400
I'm not going to say it's your fault.

587
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,440
I'm going to say that you facilitated a lot of it. Yes.

588
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,920
You facilitated a lot of it.

589
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,760
So look, she's she's taken many hits and hooks, so you don't have to, OK?

590
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
That's true. That is absolutely true.

591
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,800
She is a founding member of Team Yeet.

592
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
I told you about how Team Yeet came about, right?

593
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,280
Oh, yeah, I think I was there that night.

594
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,560
Y'all did that. Yeah.

595
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,840
Yeah, that was fun.

596
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,000
And we're going to be we're going to have more Team Yeet action.

597
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,400
Just letting y'all know.

598
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,720
But but no, I like to say that

599
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,760
it's not so much of a blame thing as a facilitation.

600
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,920
I the wheels were in motion and actually

601
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,480
the first person I played Survivor with people

602
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,760
was Nick and Isaaco.

603
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,840
When they were still doing the the Nuzlocke thing.

604
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,440
But I bought a game today.

605
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,080
I ordered it so that we would get it when it comes out.

606
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,640
I ordered Osmond.

607
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Oh, which for people who actually keep up with episode numbers.

608
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,160
And I looked it up.

609
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,720
It was episode seven hundred and ninety four that I did Osmond,

610
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:34,880
which was a game that was done by the designer of

611
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,600
of Capcom staff, Yotsui Koichi, who did Strider.

612
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,200
And Osmond was the first unofficial sequel to Strider.

613
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,960
And it's such a good game, but it's very obviously a Strider clone.

614
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,920
But I I'm not looking at anything

615
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,440
that Bobby says right now because I ordered for delivery.

616
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,240
But it's a game that's fond in our house.

617
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,000
You know, Dan's favorite game is Strider.

618
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,360
Yep. And, you know, we can't all have the great taste

619
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,560
to put the guardian legend at the top of our list.

620
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,000
But Strider is up there.

621
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,080
So I allow it. I allow it.

622
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,800
And that's really about I'm playing my stupid word game again to like

623
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,600
there's almost no challenge anymore.

624
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,560
I need I need something that has I need a game

625
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,600
like like word scapes that has a larger vocabulary.

626
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,600
Because I know these words.

627
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,800
There are some interesting words that pop in there that I'm like,

628
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,480
I don't know how people, you know, would know these otherwise,

629
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,560
but they do in there.

630
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,000
And oh, gosh, Bobby, I really want what rush.

631
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,160
I think we had the Mandalorian topper when we had the Mandalorian.

632
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,360
We have a topper for

633
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,960
Black Knight, sort of.

634
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,040
What's a pinball topper?

635
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,640
Is that the little figure that like hooks to the top of the machine?

636
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,640
OK, I've seen those. Yeah, the thing on top.

637
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,680
Yeah, I have the one for for Black Knight, sort of rage.

638
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,280
The thing is, we don't have a Black Knight, sort of rage.

639
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,760
Oops. Awesome table.

640
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,400
Our Weird Al should be coming in a couple of months, too.

641
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
We're going to be broke.

642
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,120
But anyway, that that's been the gaming,

643
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,640
and I'm actually hoping to get some Among Us time in this week.

644
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,960
That would be fun.

645
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,000
It's awesome.

646
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,440
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

647
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,000
Um, it was just Minecraft.

648
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,800
I've been working on stuff for my modded series,

649
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,920
and I finished the build in that and

650
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,400
just get into editing the video now.

651
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,440
So hopefully we'll get that soon.

652
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Still no word on the contest thing.

653
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,160
It's been over almost four weeks now.

654
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,960
We'll be coming up on four weeks of this Wednesday. So.

655
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,560
I mean, I don't know.

656
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,160
Aside from that, though,

657
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,960
there was a cool like April 1st version of Minecraft

658
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,640
with the vote update, so I've been filming stuff on there as well.

659
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,320
Hopefully I'll make a video out of that, too.

660
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,560
I haven't really been playing too much of that.

661
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,120
But I'm trying to get lots of videos.

662
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,560
I took two days off this week to hopefully do some of that,

663
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,840
but I didn't get to a lot of it. So.

664
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,280
Hopefully this week, maybe today, I don't know.

665
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,920
All right. My gaming week.

666
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,280
So before I get to the actual games, I have an interesting story

667
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,800
I have to kind of tell here on OLR.

668
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,480
And it's kind of what's been going on in my personal life the last few weeks.

669
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,560
So last week, I couldn't really talk about this,

670
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,840
but I can now because everything wrapped up on Friday.

671
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,560
But for the last two weeks, I've been on jury duty.

672
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,600
So it's, you know, something that you have to do once in a while,

673
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,200
you know, especially if your employer pays for it like mine does.

674
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,640
And it's not going to cause you a hardship.

675
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,600
I get to do that next week. Oh, boy.

676
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,400
Maybe you'll end up in the same place

677
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,160
I was because they just wrapped everything on Friday.

678
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,200
But anyway, here's the thing.

679
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,440
Here's the interesting story about that whole thing.

680
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,840
I don't really want to talk about the specifics of the case,

681
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,760
because quite honestly,

682
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,280
my brain hurts from the days of deliberations on all that.

683
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,360
And that's all I'm going to say.

684
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,760
So it's just, yeah.

685
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,880
But here's the funny, actual funny part.

686
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,240
So, you know, when they're doing the jury selection,

687
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,800
which takes like a day and a half, right?

688
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,960
You know, they're going through and they're interviewing everybody.

689
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,920
And I realized I didn't realize it right away,

690
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,280
but I realized on a break,

691
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,240
we were all kind of sitting out from the hall and I'm looking across from him,

692
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,920
like, this guy looks kind of familiar. And I'm like, Drew?

693
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,280
And he's like, yeah, hi. I was wondering when you noticed me. Yeah.

694
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,760
Intern Drew and I were on the same fucking case at jury duty. How's that?

695
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,680
What a small world is that? So for those that don't know, intern Drew,

696
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,280
when we were doing the show more live, you know,

697
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,240
we'd have like the actual like people in the, in the room, not just us,

698
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,840
but we had guests all the time and all that stuff.

699
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,400
So Drew was infamous when we used to do this show in the garage.

700
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,640
He knocked over the soundboard in the middle of one show. It was really funny.

701
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,800
But anyway, but here's, here's why that's funny and why I bring it up.

702
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,280
Because as part of the whole process,

703
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,320
when they're deciding who's going to be on the jury and who's not,

704
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,280
they actually ask you a series of question. And one of them is,

705
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,040
do you know any of the other jurors? And I had to be like, actually,

706
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,000
yes I do. And they probably don't hear that one a lot. And they're like,

707
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,320
well, who do you know? And I pointed it out. And so how do you know him?

708
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,920
And I had to say, well, we,

709
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,720
we run in similar nerdy gaming type of circles and he's been on my podcast.

710
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,080
And then the judge wants to ask about the podcast and wants to ask like, am I,

711
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,240
do I know not to talk about the case on the podcast?

712
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,760
Which obviously I did not last week when this was still going on.

713
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,640
I can say stuff now. I don't want to talk about the case anyways.

714
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,760
I'm not going to tell you those specifics, but I'll tell you, you know,

715
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,160
about this. Cause it's funny.

716
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,280
And the fact that now it's on official record legal

717
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,000
record that this podcast exists finally acknowledgement in

718
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,120
some form or the other, all because I knew Drew,

719
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,000
but I guess the punchline to all that drew did not get selected for the jury

720
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,800
because they pulled like 60 people into that room and they had the jury after

721
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,000
the first 20 or so.

722
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,080
So they never got to like two thirds of that room had to come there for like

723
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,680
two days, never to even get called up. And Drew was one of those folks.

724
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,800
So he got to go, but I had,

725
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,880
I had to text him after it was done going like you won't believe how that

726
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,880
went. So anyway,

727
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,000
that's out. Oh, the other interesting thing about that,

728
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,160
I have to give a hello to any of the other jurors that I met who might be

729
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,560
listening.

730
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Cause I'm going to tell you there were more people legitimately interested in my

731
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,560
podcast at jury duty than there were the last E3 I went to.

732
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,960
So if any of the jurors I was on the case with actually made it this far into

733
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,160
the podcast, like thank you for,

734
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,040
cause God knows you heard enough of me the last two days.

735
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,040
Thank you for being here this far into the show.

736
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,520
And I'm glad you enjoy it and all that good stuff. But that was,

737
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,240
that was just a isn't that interesting. Wow. Type of thing. Small world, right?

738
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,640
Small world. So I see, I see Drew twice a week. I know that's why,

739
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,440
that's why I texted you going, um, I need Drew's contact info.

740
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,080
Like after it was done, I'm sure that came out in the blue. Like,

741
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,520
why does Rob want to talk to Drew?

742
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,440
But I was able to tell you cause it was after Friday at that point. But yeah,

743
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,440
I remember Drew saying that he wasn't chosen for a case at work and I was like,

744
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,840
Oh, okay. You know, and then now this comes up.

745
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Guess who was,

746
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,240
but it was, it was literally luck of the draw.

747
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,880
Like my number was 11 in the list, which puts you,

748
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,200
it's one of the first 12.

749
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,640
So if the prosecution or defense doesn't kick you at that point,

750
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,360
based on the answers to your question, you're stuck. You're there.

751
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,440
I will say this is the irony.

752
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,760
So this is the second case I've ever sat on jury for the last one was in 2006,

753
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,960
long time ago. The show was still going, but it was a long time ago, right?

754
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,480
I was also juror 11 in that case.

755
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,840
So that number is fucking cursed. That's all I have to say.

756
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,360
It's what I shouldn't, I shouldn't it, you know,

757
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,200
I was really irritated at first because you know, my day job and all this stuff,

758
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,880
but then you get to a certain point where you're invested in it and you're like,

759
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,280
all right, I want to give this a fair shot. I want to do what's right.

760
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,720
I want to, you know, so yeah, I think it'll be fun. Oh yeah.

761
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,880
I was telling Shane about it and he was like, man,

762
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,200
I never get called for jury duty. I want to do it. And I'm like,

763
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,840
next time I get a summons, you can have it. Just, just go tell them you're me.

764
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,960
It wouldn't be so bad.

765
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,280
Like if I wasn't in Sacramento County cause driving, I hate driving downtown.

766
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,200
That's really it. Like it is the worst for me. I got to go home on lunch.

767
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,400
Oh, well, lucky you. But like, um,

768
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,320
I'm going to be that far from where I live if it, if it wasn't like, you know,

769
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,800
driving downtown and parking and all that, like the parking lots and.

770
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,000
The parking lot is not that bad anymore.

771
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,160
The parking lot really isn't bad.

772
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,480
I think they call less people because of COVID that it was not bad at all.

773
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,280
OK, well, that's good at least because it used to be a nightmare

774
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,560
just to do all that stuff.

775
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,320
No, I mean, that said though, at least I would enjoy like the local eateries

776
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,840
around there. They've got a really nice, like New York style,

777
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,760
or it's actually like a New York pizza chain or pizza place,

778
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,880
authentic New York stuff. They have that there.

779
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,200
Then they have like an authentic French soup place. That's also awesome. So,

780
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,440
uh, hopefully.

781
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,320
As the show and how to Matt and chat says, you know,

782
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,520
some legal intern had to listen to the show to make sure Rob didn't say

783
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,280
anything. I don't think so. No, I, I, yeah,

784
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,520
because I don't think they ever asked the name. I'm trying to remember.

785
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,120
I don't think she ever asked the name of it, but it's, what am I going to say?

786
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,280
Like, if I told you what the case was about,

787
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:59,120
it literally has nothing to do with anything that ever comes up on this program.

788
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,640
So it's like, why would I bring it up? So there's no, there's no point. So,

789
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,480
um, but yeah, so then, but, but there was,

790
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,440
so one of the people who had asked about my show was a juror who ultimately did

791
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,600
get kicked off. So she might've heard last week's show. I don't know.

792
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,040
If you're out there, hi, hi. Say, say hello, drop me a line on Twitter at Mr.

793
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,120
Rob Roberts. So let's say, say hello or whatever. Um, but yeah,

794
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,120
there was some, it was, uh, one of the other days I was,

795
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,200
so I didn't play a lot of games there at the courthouse cause you can't,

796
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,200
they're very strict. Like you cannot have your phones on in the courtroom just,

797
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,840
but when you're in the hallway killing time,

798
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,960
I would sit there and I'd have Pokemon go open.

799
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,640
And I was like catching stuff that was spawning around the courthouse.

800
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,920
And it did catch the attention of one of the other jurors who came up with you

801
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,560
play Pokemon go. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

802
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,840
I'm a little bit like trying to hide it. Like, no, that's for nerds.

803
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,360
Yeah. I play Pokemon go traded friend codes and all that.

804
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:57,240
So yeah, I forgot to mention, I actually, uh, opened up,

805
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,280
I installed an opened up ingress this weekend. Did you just, just to see,

806
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,320
you know,

807
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,520
what was going on and like where I was at in Rancho it was all gray.

808
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,960
Like all of it was gray.

809
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,760
There's a lot less people that play than they used to.

810
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,760
But, uh, yeah, I checked that out and I checked out Orna. Orna, I,

811
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,880
I can't navigate it anymore. It's just completely different now.

812
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,280
So I'm lost in that and ingress. I couldn't do anything. So I was like, eh,

813
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,080
uninstall. I don't know.

814
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,320
I understand. All right. So games I did play, that's enough about my outfit,

815
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,800
but I thought you'd all enjoy that story about how OLR sort of ended up on the

816
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,040
public record. Um, anyhow, uh,

817
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,920
so games I've played this week,

818
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,600
I've still continuing in Pokemon legends are chaos. Uh,

819
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,440
I actually am past the point I was at the first time I played through that

820
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:44,920
game.

821
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,040
There's something about Pokemon games where like if I start them a year after

822
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,040
they come out, I get a lot for actually that games out game has been out,

823
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,240
I think more like two years, but still,

824
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,960
I get a lot farther if I play after it's out and so forth than I do the first

825
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,200
time. I'm actually really enjoying like the game and this play through.

826
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,440
And I do plan on finishing it, uh,

827
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,400
before the pixel remasters release on console. Uh, thank you depth.

828
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,960
I couldn't remember if look pandemic lockdowns completely changed my sense of

829
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,520
time. I couldn't remember if it was one or two years.

830
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,440
So it's only one year old.

831
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,720
So I guess I beat sword and shield about a year after they came out.

832
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:18,720
So I guess I'm right on schedule and I'll probably finally get to violet and

833
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:23,360
scarlet this fall. So, Hey, it, it works out that way. But, um, yeah,

834
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,440
so I've been playing a lot of that,

835
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,120
but I'm still continuing on some old favorites, including, uh, Diablo three.

836
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,400
I'm at like paragraph 550 for the current season. Uh,

837
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,160
fall fantasy 14 been playing a little bit of that. Uh, even,

838
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,480
I even dipped into some dead by daylight, uh,

839
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,760
here and there a little bit this week. And, um, what else?

840
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,840
There was something else I played. I can't remember.

841
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,000
So it must not have been that big a deal, I guess. But, um, yeah, I just been,

842
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,320
you know, doing different stuff, filling time and yeah,

843
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,440
been enjoying the Pokemon play through that's for sure. So, uh,

844
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,960
looking forward to finishing up that up. All right. Uh,

845
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,480
we're going to get into some more gaming news and what's going on around the

846
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,240
industry and gaming culture as well. So let's get to it.

847
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,600
Loki wants to start us off.

848
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,040
So Microsoft doesn't want you to use their consoles for emulation,

849
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,520
um, is what they're trying to do.

850
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,040
So they've basically cracked down on folks using, uh,

851
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:23,080
emulators that were installed using the dev mode that you can put your Xbox

852
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,200
series S or X in, I think you can do that with the Xbox one,

853
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,440
but specifically the Xbox X and S, um,

854
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,000
allowing you to run those apps like retro arts, uh,

855
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,880
PP SPP and duck station, um,

856
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,200
using the universal windows platform versions of those games.

857
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,800
Um, so now they're basically cracking down on those, uh,

858
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,880
according to one of the developers.

859
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,200
So essentially Microsoft cracked down on my uploads, uh,

860
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,160
where they used to last months to weeks to days and until now. Um,

861
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,160
so I would simply re upload the apps whenever they were taken down to get

862
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,440
newcomers and everyone back up and running.

863
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,480
But it says the crackdown started ramp up around the end of summer going into

864
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,720
autumn, where they dealt with daily tech downs for awhile.

865
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,920
So the day after they went up, they'd be taken down.

866
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,600
We managed to find a way to get them the last three days. Um,

867
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,560
so I'm not naming them retro arch instead using randomized names.

868
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,320
Um, but yeah,

869
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,080
they're just increasingly being taken down if they're seen to be like a emulator

870
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,520
or something like that. So you're just gonna,

871
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,920
you're just gonna have to use the PC like everybody else or,

872
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,920
or a steam deck or whatever else that you want to run it on.

873
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,120
Well, I imagine Microsoft just wants nothing to do with the perception. Again,

874
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,480
it's, it's not always about what's right and wrong,

875
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,840
but it's about the perception, right?

876
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,120
And Microsoft does not even want that perception of, look,

877
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,560
you can play Zelda on your Xbox just by using this specific, they don't want,

878
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,120
they don't want that.

879
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,760
That's not what the modes for anyways.

880
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,200
The mode is meant for people developing games to be able to test them on the

881
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,280
hardware that they are being developed for,

882
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,640
not to install apps to run side layers. Yeah. Yeah.

883
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,600
So besides you have the dolphin emulator coming to steam still,

884
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,760
if that is to be, that is still on track, right? As far as we know,

885
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,600
we haven't seen a shutdown or anything. It's going to be interesting. So,

886
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,000
all right, we'll see. All right, moving on.

887
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,560
Let's talk about one of my favorite games. No Man's Sky.

888
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,360
No Man's Sky got another update this week. I mean, it's, it's been six weeks.

889
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,320
There must be another update.

890
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,280
This update is called the interceptor update and the interceptor update will

891
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,360
actually add new ships to the game as well as something called corrupt worlds.

892
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,960
So these planets can turn into purple hazed worlds that have purple crystals.

893
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,000
And then it basically has changed a little bit of the sentinels.

894
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,160
So there are some new sentinel types. So some new enemies there,

895
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,680
they're spider-like and yes, crab-like machines.

896
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,280
They're not giant enemy crabs though.

897
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,040
They're small enemy crabs just for the record.

898
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,040
If there's purple hazes on those planets,

899
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,880
have you run into captain Jimi Hendrix?

900
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,560
No, no I have not. But I can, let me see,

901
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,640
there was a trailer for this out somewhere and of course I don't have it up,

902
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,840
but let me see if I can find it.

903
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,960
And purple crystals on everything.

904
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,760
That's starting to sound like the suicide squad trailer.

905
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,560
Yeah, but it actually looks, oops, sorry.

906
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,040
Little Xbox noise there in the background,

907
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,040
but that's because I actually have what that looks like

908
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,800
here on the side. Hold on. I'm multitasking.

909
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,640
Cause the husband just brought me coffee. Thank you.

910
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,640
Let me show you this real quick here on the other monitor,

911
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,360
what this looks like while I talk about this. Sorry. There we go. Okay.

912
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,200
So you can see that like it's these corrupt world planets look very purply

913
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,440
and so forth is what they have.

914
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,760
They're also talking improved visuals and new features for virtual reality.

915
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,920
So I know that just went live not that long ago,

916
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,360
but they've done some perfections on that. And then of course,

917
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,920
these new Sentinel type ships are in there too.

918
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,600
There's also an ability called the anti-gravity well,

919
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,280
that could be very interesting and fun. Also improvements focused on Xbox.

920
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,160
I always thought the game looked fine on Xbox,

921
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,120
but I guess there are some,

922
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,600
some imperfections that they were ironing out for smooth and consistent

923
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,880
frame rate. Anyway, that is all out now. Again,

924
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,800
that is the no man's sky interceptor update.

925
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,520
Here's the thing for me and why I'm not like super excited about this is that

926
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,840
this is a little more of a combat focused update. It sounds like,

927
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,400
especially with the upgrades to Sentinels.

928
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,680
And I did not particularly care for the last combat update that they did.

929
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,480
Why did my co-hosts go gray all of a sudden? Uh oh.

930
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,360
Are you all still there? Oh, that was so weird. Sorry. Yeah, that was weird.

931
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,520
Anyway. Um, but, um, yeah, so it's,

932
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,240
it's neat that this updates out. I'm not super enthused about combat updates,

933
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,960
but I do appreciate that the difficulty tuning update will allow you to

934
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,320
change the difficulty, uh, down so that you don't see these as much.

935
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,200
I just think, um,

936
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,960
I just think that, um, the next expedition, whenever that comes out,

937
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,960
because they didn't, this didn't launch with an expedition,

938
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,240
which I thought was interesting. Cause it was about time for one.

939
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,960
Maybe they're ironing out. Cause I feel like they did this last time.

940
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,880
They're ironing out all the bugs before they launch it. Uh,

941
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,320
we'll probably focus on this stuff. And I don't know if I'm going to like that.

942
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,040
Uh, because I'm not super big on the combat. It can be difficult sometimes,

943
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,400
but we'll see. Maybe I love the game. Don't get me wrong.

944
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,920
This is just the one area of the game.

945
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,840
I don't like as much as the other areas like exploration and building and all

946
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,480
that stuff. The purple planets look cool though. I will say that. So,

947
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,560
uh, a big hello to Marissa Meisel, who's in our chat saying,

948
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,200
I thought court cases on these issues tend to rule that you can do what you

949
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,400
want with your product after you buy it. Not endorsing law breaking,

950
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,040
but you get the idea. Yeah, you're right. Marissa,

951
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,200
like you can do whatever you want with your Xbox. It's it's your Xbox, right? Uh,

952
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,600
but Microsoft still, still doesn't want that perception out there.

953
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,760
They still have the right to what they can and they can't put on the store and

954
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,280
you know,

955
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,920
putting the blocks in there so that you can't install your own stuff because

956
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,600
it's also a store place, right?

957
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,040
But if you do find a way to sideload apps and so forth,

958
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,680
then that's on you and you can essentially do what you want. Uh,

959
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,960
that all goes back to the PlayStation three, I want to say, and the other OS,

960
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,280
remember the government,

961
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,280
the government loved PlayStation three because it was a powerful

962
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,160
supercomputer for not too expensive.

963
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,240
But then when they got rid of the other OS saying that actually affected the

964
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,600
government, but you didn't have to update. What's that?

965
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,160
Wasn't it the PS2 that ran Linux? No, it was PS3. No, it was PS3. Yeah.

966
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,640
They may have had a PS2 Linux thing. Yeah, they may have had a PS2, but not,

967
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:44,520
not like officially supported. So anyway.

968
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,680
All right. Um, but that is the No Man's Sky Interceptor update.

969
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,440
Let's move on to our next story from Dark Sakura.

970
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,440
So, um, wow, Konami, and this doesn't have anything to do with Pachi slot.

971
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:58,800
Uh,

972
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Konami is really working on a game developing comeback and they announced,

973
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,960
um, that their Osaka studio is now open.

974
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,640
It is a development focused studio with, uh,

975
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:17,800
the best brand newest equipment to build new games for, uh,

976
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,280
the current, uh, consoles and those on their way. Um,

977
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,440
they said, uh,

978
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,520
that they're opening the Konami's group, uh, next generation, uh,

979
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,160
R and D in 2025. And that, uh,

980
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,080
you know, they should be done with outsourcing, you know,

981
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,040
like they're doing with Silent Hill right now.

982
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,760
And they are going to actually, my apologies.

983
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,200
They say they are still going to be doing some outsourcing like they are with,

984
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,600
uh, Silent Hill. Um, but,

985
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,160
and this is the quote, uh,

986
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,160
the Konami Osaka studio is a developmental relocation of the existing studio and

987
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,760
comes with the concept of creators first. Um,

988
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,240
so they want to have the best environment for development where their creators

989
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,840
can reach their full potential.

990
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,920
They're going to be over 9,000, but their,

991
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,520
their R and D, um, center, like I said,

992
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,520
is going to be done by 2025 and it's called Konami creative front Tokyo Bay.

993
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:34,120
And it is, uh, in construction at Ariake, uh, Kotaku.

994
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,400
So there you go.

995
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,240
I have to admit I'm, I'm skeptical. You know,

996
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,560
Konami hasn't done a lot of great stuff for me,

997
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,000
especially in the home entertainment space.

998
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,400
I realized the arcade divisions been kicking, you know,

999
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,480
and doing good stuff for a while now.

1000
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,880
Obviously I have reasons to distrust Konami in this space,

1001
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,560
but I'm also willing to look at it and go, look,

1002
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,960
this has been going on for years and maybe Konami is realizing they have to do

1003
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,640
something different. And if this is a start of something different and maybe,

1004
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:08,240
you know, this is not just a new office, but a newly managed office, a newly,

1005
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,120
you know, and it's a sign of a future thing, then I remain open to it.

1006
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,680
Let's see what they put out there. Um,

1007
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,320
I know we've got that Suikoden remake that's coming out that, you know,

1008
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,760
people are very excited about. Um,

1009
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
I don't think that one is actually outsourced.

1010
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,880
I think that is an in-house thing they're doing. I could be wrong on that. Uh,

1011
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,760
but you know, it could be, it could be the start.

1012
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,880
There's been rumors for a while about Castlevania coming back in some form or

1013
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,600
another. So, uh, it could be very interesting to see what the studio brings us,

1014
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,800
but I, you can understand if I'm a little bit cautiously, I have huge,

1015
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,560
like I, I need to see the, the facts to get me really excited on this stuff.

1016
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,960
Right. So, yeah, I'm with SHO 100 Matt in chat.

1017
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,320
I'm open-minded, but I'm careful in getting my hopes up.

1018
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,480
It's a very good way of putting it. All right, let's move on. Loki.

1019
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,160
All right.

1020
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:05,640
So let's talk a little bit more about how Nintendo is cracking down on things.

1021
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,680
And so now they're coming after.

1022
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,320
It's not just Microsoft this week.

1023
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,960
It's not just Microsoft. Um, no,

1024
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,360
they're are coming after point crow,

1025
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:19,040
who is a YouTuber who also developed a mod for breath of the

1026
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,720
wild, but allows you to play it in multiplayer.

1027
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,200
I'm familiar with point crow because he tends to team up with Doug, Doug,

1028
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,640
and I watched Doug, Doug religiously. Um, and I have watched them play.

1029
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,240
It sounds like an awesome mod. It is pretty cool.

1030
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,160
They do like different challenges and stuff like that using it.

1031
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,880
And it's just kind of a lot of fun. Well,

1032
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,080
of course Nintendo has been taking down, um,

1033
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,280
or demonetizing his videos that feature that mod,

1034
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:49,560
basically copyright claiming them. And, um, you know,

1035
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,760
that's kind of annoying, but also I guess kind of expected, um,

1036
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,960
according to point grow, he posts on Twitter,

1037
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,080
incredibly disappointed in 10 of America has decided to block my videos and

1038
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:00,920
breath of the wild.

1039
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,880
It's the love for the community and innovation that we bring that has kept it

1040
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,480
alive and brought new people to love the Zelda series.

1041
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,240
I hope you reverse your decision. Uh, they won't. Um,

1042
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,000
and then of course they go along with that though.

1043
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,400
He also did release the mod to the public. Um,

1044
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,200
I think that actually was before they took that stuff down.

1045
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,400
Might have been why they took that stuff or, uh, tried to copyright claim it,

1046
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,160
but, um,

1047
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,560
too late once on the internet, always on the internet.

1048
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,360
Yep. So, so, well, that's, I mean,

1049
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,160
I don't know what to think,

1050
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,640
because obviously Nintendo is notorious about protecting its IPS,

1051
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,120
especially when you start to do these types of things. Right. Um, and I, you know,

1052
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,800
there's a new Zelda game on the horizon and I know it doesn't have multiplayer

1053
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:53,400
out the gate anyway, but who's to say if there's one thing, you know,

1054
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:57,080
I know y'all have been joking in chat and I've been joking myself about making a

1055
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,640
lot of predictions that came true this year. Right. But here's what,

1056
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,120
here's what anyone can predict.

1057
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,720
There's going to be DLC for the new Zelda game. Here's the game,

1058
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,560
but there will be DLC at some point for that.

1059
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,240
Who's to say the multiplayer wouldn't be maybe one of the,

1060
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,120
it won't be because they don't know that the internet exists.

1061
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,400
So therefore it won't be like, I know we joke about Nintendo,

1062
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,400
like being well behind the times when it comes to technology, but yeah,

1063
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,720
I just don't think that they're going to put effort into develop multiplayer in

1064
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,400
this game. I don't think one that their engine can run it. Um,

1065
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,800
cause this is being done through emulation and on a PC.

1066
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,840
Oh, that's the no, no part. That's the no, no part. So that,

1067
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,400
that's how they're able to do a lot of these mods. I mean, that's just any mod.

1068
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,920
It's really through emulation and modding, um, the ISO and stuff like that.

1069
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,680
So I just don't think that they're going to be able to pull that off with just

1070
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,120
the Nintendo switch hardware, maybe on another system. Yeah. But like right now,

1071
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,840
they're just not going to do it. I just don't see it happening.

1072
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,440
I did not realize it was just like a modded switch thing. It was actually a PC.

1073
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,000
Uh, that's why they don't,

1074
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,200
they don't want people knowing you can play it on your PC.

1075
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,760
They still sell copies of breath of the wild full price, by the way.

1076
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,840
There's still like, yeah, and there's still like things I've, I watch. Um,

1077
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,160
one of the things I watched Doug Doug do a lot is, uh,

1078
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,200
the breath of the wild randomizers were randomize and stuff.

1079
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,000
So that's kind of neat, but yeah, it's just a lot of that stuff.

1080
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,520
Obviously in any randomizer that you see on the internet nowadays,

1081
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,520
for any game it's just done through emulation. And so, yeah, I mean,

1082
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,000
I mean, I don't think it's really hurting anything honestly, but like,

1083
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,200
I get it. Like if you want to like take down something like take down,

1084
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,320
like cease and desist the mod or something like that,

1085
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,960
but like copyright claiming a video and that just seems weird,

1086
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,520
especially when it's like, we'll copyright claim a video that's using the mod,

1087
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,560
but we won't copyright claim a video that just features the game.

1088
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,160
It's just, it's, it's a way to, it's a, I mean,

1089
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,600
yes it's well within the right to do that cause they own some of the content,

1090
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,360
but it's also just a way to abuse that content system to stop people from not

1091
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,640
seeing things that you don't want them to see is really what it comes down to.

1092
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,360
So it's like, it's a legal gray area, but I mean,

1093
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:14,800
they're, they're abusing their powers.

1094
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,920
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf points out some randomizers will spit out a ROM image and

1095
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,040
you can play it on original hardware. Yeah. There's a lot of, um, like, you know,

1096
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,160
the eight bit randomizers or even 16 bit. Uh, yeah,

1097
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,200
I spit out a new ROM image.

1098
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,920
I know I was fucking around with like Zelda randomizers, Metroid.

1099
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,520
There's actually that really cool Zelda and Metroid randomizer.

1100
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,280
I really liked that one where like you go into a dungeon and it spits you out

1101
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,400
Metroid somewhere. It's pretty cool. So, um, let's see.

1102
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,240
Marissa in chat says, uh,

1103
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,600
my boyfriend said we'll get Tears of the Kingdom when it's on sale over

1104
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,040
Christmas. And I laughed and laughed. He doesn't know.

1105
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,720
I would say your best bet with that, if you,

1106
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,600
I don't even know if these are available anymore.

1107
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,040
Somebody will have to let me know. But Nintendo had that whole, um,

1108
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,880
two game ticket that you buy a ticket for like a hundred dollars and you can get

1109
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,320
two games with it. That will be your best chance to get that game.

1110
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,760
I think $20 off. Cause they're selling that for 70 now. Right?

1111
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,880
So that ticket will let you have it for 50 essentially,

1112
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,720
but you have to have another game that you also want to get on sale.

1113
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,740
So it's like the, it's the Costco deal. You get a discount,

1114
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,580
but you've got to buy a bulk and that's about the closest thing probably to

1115
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,460
that right now. If that's even still available, I'm not sure it is.

1116
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,020
Somebody in chat will have to, uh, uh, verify with me.

1117
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,580
Cause I know it was a couple of months ago they were offering that. So, um,

1118
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,420
all right, let's move on. And I want to talk about, Ooh, Sony.

1119
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,420
We've talked about Microsoft in the news, Nintendo and legal news. How about so,

1120
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:39,780
let's,

1121
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,860
let's go for the tic-tac-toe and talk about Sony in legal news this week.

1122
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,300
Sony is mad.

1123
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,940
Sony was kicking and screaming, uh,

1124
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:53,820
against UK regulators about their surprising unprecedented and

1125
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,940
irrational decision, uh, on this,

1126
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:01,180
this week about allowing basically the Microsoft Activision merger to go

1127
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:06,220
through. Um, some of the things that Sony said, uh, in the,

1128
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:10,300
uh, their retort, uh,

1129
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:14,060
the provisional findings assessed a significant body of evidence in the round to

1130
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,940
support its finding that Microsoft would have the ability and incentive to

1131
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,460
withhold Activision content.

1132
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,500
And that this would substantially lessen competition by foreclosing

1133
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,180
PlayStation. In assessing this body of evidence,

1134
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:29,060
the PFs emphasize consistent with a jury jurisprudence on the

1135
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:33,580
CMA's duty to assess evidence that it is particularly important in this case to

1136
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,460
assess the merged entities incentive to foreclose by considering all the

1137
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:41,660
available evidence in the round, rather than focus on a single model, uh,

1138
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,940
or referring to the actual findings.

1139
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:48,060
It gets into a lot of this legal language and so forth,

1140
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:53,300
but essentially they're pissed off because they think that Microsoft could

1141
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,620
still release versions that have different quality,

1142
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:58,980
including versions that have technical issues and so forth. Uh,

1143
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:02,500
Sony saying in an infamous quote, they hit social media.

1144
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,700
Sony said call of duty gamers are passionate,

1145
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,260
knowledgeable and sophisticated. Just like you hear on voice chat, right?

1146
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,900
Why would you go through that?

1147
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:17,300
Why would you purposely release a buggy game on a certain call?

1148
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:21,380
That doesn't make any, any sense whatsoever why you would do that.

1149
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:25,060
Why would you spend the time? Hey, let's purposely break this game. Yes.

1150
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,620
Could they release a copy that has like, I don't know,

1151
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,220
like an additional bull, additional playable character or something like that.

1152
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,460
Spiderman. Could they do that? Maybe.

1153
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,500
But I think that the only reason Sony would think that is because of projection

1154
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,220
because they've done it themselves,

1155
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,700
but like to actually intently make a game that's broken, like,

1156
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,980
I mean, this is stupid.

1157
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:51,340
Uh,

1158
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:55,180
SD200 Matt says Sony is grasping at straws. They, they are,

1159
01:05:55,220 --> 01:06:00,020
but I also understand a little bit why, um,

1160
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,780
they're grasping at straws. I mean, yeah, this is, I, I,

1161
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:07,620
I don't think this goes well for Sony, but at the same time, you know,

1162
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,700
I don't think this like ruins Sony or anything. It's just,

1163
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,460
it's just another chess piece mover in this game because you know what?

1164
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:18,100
Then Sony ends up buying Square Enix and we still won't get the pixel remasters

1165
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:18,940
on Xbox.

1166
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:23,140
I don't think they would go that far to even do the parody thing that Microsoft's

1167
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,500
trying to do with this. So I, I just,

1168
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:28,460
I don't see this bringing Sony to its knees,

1169
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:32,860
but is it going to impact their business? Sure. But them's the break Sony.

1170
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:37,260
I think Sony's got a bigger problem with what they're looking at with, with,

1171
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,220
for some reason,

1172
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:43,060
the U S Congress people wanting to write notes about the their issues in

1173
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:45,100
Japan. But I mean,

1174
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:48,900
some of it, they're kind of right though.

1175
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:53,580
Like Sony has a choke hold on the Japanese market with Nintendo,

1176
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,500
but when it comes to the high end gaming,

1177
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,220
the roles are reversed.

1178
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:01,180
They would not make a commitment to put those games on. They will not be like,

1179
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:04,100
why would we, why are we purchasing the company if we're in, you know,

1180
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:08,540
share the assets with them? No, they don't. Where's God of war.

1181
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:13,740
Where's any of those games could be on Xbox. They're not, except,

1182
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,460
I'm sorry, except MLB, the show. But that, that,

1183
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:21,220
that is like legally required to be there from their agreement with MLB.

1184
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,540
So that's the one game.

1185
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,060
I will say it is interesting playing Minecraft dungeons on the PlayStation five

1186
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,820
and seeing the Xbox logo come up. It's it,

1187
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,340
there is something so weird about it. I will say.

1188
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:38,140
I mean, it's just, it's, it's just really weird though. Like in this day,

1189
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:42,220
like they said, like, listen, we've got, we've committed to 10 years. I mean,

1190
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:47,260
yeah, like 10 years time, like time to come up with your own shooter,

1191
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:48,420
then like obviously, yeah.

1192
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,140
In 10 years, video games are going to look different.

1193
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,140
We will have the holodeck in 10 years.

1194
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,220
The holiday will be here in 10 years.

1195
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:59,020
Probably not, but like, it'll still be like, it'll still be better,

1196
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,620
but like at the same time. Yeah. It's just, I just,

1197
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:06,180
that is just the all of you out there asking when this show will end when the

1198
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,180
holodeck is released, the show's over because that's, that's it folks.

1199
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:15,060
We we've set in the very beginning gaming is always one step closer to the

1200
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,540
holodeck. When we get the holodeck, that's it. No LR.

1201
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:23,540
It's done because we, we hit the end folks that no more hot takes.

1202
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,380
We did it.

1203
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:34,380
What do you say we end when the holodeck comes out? Sounds good.

1204
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,380
Actually, no, what we'll do.

1205
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:39,100
Someone's going to release a VR headset called the holodeck and we're like,

1206
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:39,940
dang it.

1207
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:41,380
O-L-R in the holodeck.

1208
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,180
All right. Anyway, moving on.

1209
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,060
Bonds double 06 says, but Rob,

1210
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,020
you could be right in my bedroom every Sunday with the halo deck.

1211
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,700
I wish I could say you're the first listener to invite me to your bedroom.

1212
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:01,700
Just kidding. Just kidding. All right. Moving on.

1213
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,700
Let's go to

1214
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,540
the halo deck.

1215
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,180
Or am I? Moving on.

1216
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,260
Let's go to our next story.

1217
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,580
Dark Sakura quickly changed the topic.

1218
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:19,540
So going back to the earlier topic of the Mario movie,

1219
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,340
there are, of course, going to be specialty soundtracks released.

1220
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:29,420
You can get a two LP exclusive

1221
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,660
with with various colors.

1222
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:36,260
There is a pink and yellow and a green and red.

1223
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:39,780
You can get a seven inch that just says Bowser on it.

1224
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:42,900
There's a CD and a cassette.

1225
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:46,620
Yes, you can get the the Super Mario

1226
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,860
Brothers movie soundtrack on cassette for 20 bucks.

1227
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,420
That's rad cassette.

1228
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:57,380
I would only be even more like.

1229
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,660
I don't know feeling about it if they said eight track.

1230
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,980
But because I find the cassette thing, if that makes sense, because,

1231
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,700
yeah, I find the cassette thing ironic because when I was a kid,

1232
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:17,820
I had the Game Boy and I had my little cord from Radio Shack

1233
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:23,140
that allowed me to plug that in from the Game Boy out to the mic in in my

1234
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,420
tape deck or whatever.

1235
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:28,500
And I actually make cassette tapes of Game Boy soundtracks.

1236
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,300
Basically, I would play and let the music play in the background. So

1237
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,740
the cassette will include.

1238
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:37,380
And by the way, it is an I am a bit exclusive.

1239
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,380
The cassette will either be red or green.

1240
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,700
Randomly has music from the movie.

1241
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,780
It has a song Peaches by Jack Black as Bowser

1242
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:54,060
movie score, some themes by Koji Kondo, and it's shipping Q3 2023.

1243
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:58,020
I I guess I shouldn't ask because this is probably a spoiler, but I'm going to.

1244
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,820
Is that is that the president of the United States of America song from like the 90s?

1245
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,260
Peaches? No, millions of Peaches.

1246
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:10,340
Peaches for me, because I when I heard that Bowser sang a song called Peaches,

1247
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:14,060
I was like, that would actually be really funny if that was something he was singing

1248
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,860
about the princess, millions of Peaches, Peaches for free.

1249
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:23,700
That song ruled whatever, whatever happened to Pusa.

1250
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,780
Whatever happened to them, are they still around?

1251
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,540
Did they just fade into obscurity like a lot of 90s bands?

1252
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,860
That's sad. All right, anyway.

1253
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:34,660
But what was the other?

1254
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:35,660
There was another big song.

1255
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:40,260
The duh duh duh duh duh duh is in my head.

1256
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,860
That's it. That's it.

1257
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:44,380
Yeah, I said, because I instantly went to the weird, weird.

1258
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:47,140
I mean, that is the more recognizable version.

1259
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:50,940
Yes. Oh, God.

1260
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,100
That was all right.

1261
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:57,700
Anyway, Zen Monkey 11 says, I thought they were called the dead presidents.

1262
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,500
No, there's a dead Kennedys, but that's a very different band.

1263
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,220
All right. Moving on.

1264
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:08,820
The dead presidents was the the robbery gang from Point Break.

1265
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,380
Oh, wow. That's that's a deep cut.

1266
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,580
I love it. All right.

1267
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,860
You wouldn't know how many times I saw that movie?

1268
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,700
I'm going to say a lot.

1269
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:23,500
Because I was a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and I watched it just to see Flea.

1270
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,460
I love that. Yeah.

1271
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:29,380
Oh, my God. Fleas, Fleas probably is.

1272
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:31,460
The Kennedys were both in it, and

1273
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,220
the character shot himself in the foot.

1274
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,260
That's what I remember.

1275
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,700
Is Fleas in his 60s now, right?

1276
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,500
Gotta be. I think so.

1277
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,900
He was also in My Own Private Idaho.

1278
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:43,340
Does he still play on stage in just his tighty whities

1279
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:44,860
or did he finally leave that era behind?

1280
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,460
Yes. And you know, Point Break started Kiana Reeves,

1281
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:55,100
who was in John Wick number four, which was in theaters,

1282
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,100
which I went and saw a movie in the theater.

1283
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:03,060
Then they had a trailer for, you know, those classic theater,

1284
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,100
you know, the classic movies that they play,

1285
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,100
which had Footloose starring Kevin Bacon.

1286
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:13,220
I was just about to ask, how does this tie to Kevin Bacon?

1287
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:16,060
And you did it. You did it.

1288
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,780
Also, did you know that Flea plays trumpet?

1289
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:21,420
No, I didn't.

1290
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:25,180
But I mean, I am not surprised at all that a lot of these like rockers

1291
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,780
and I can't believe I'm about to call Red Hot Chili Peppers classic rock,

1292
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,260
but maybe a little bit.

1293
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,420
A lot of these classic rockers are actually like classically trained,

1294
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,980
like a lot of them are like are like deeply musically trained

1295
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,300
more than you would think.

1296
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:44,380
So the lead singer of Queensryche was actually an operatic trained baritone.

1297
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,700
Yeah. Oh, for sure.

1298
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,060
So anyway, voice. Oh, my God.

1299
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,340
So good. Let's move on.

1300
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:52,580
Let's move on to the next story.

1301
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,820
Nintendo issues. How about it, Loki?

1302
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:59,820
Yes. So it's apparently Nintendo is now expanding

1303
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,540
their Joy-Con repair system for the UK and Europe.

1304
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:08,420
They made the statement saying Nintendo takes a great pride

1305
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,820
in creating high quality and durable products

1306
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,940
and is continuously making improvements to them, therefore.

1307
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,780
And until further notice, Nintendo offers to consumers

1308
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:22,220
who purchase their respective products in EEA, UK and Switzerland

1309
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:28,140
that repairs for responsiveness syndrome relating to control six drift

1310
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:31,420
will be conducted by Nintendo

1311
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,180
at no official Nintendo centers at no charge.

1312
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:39,900
The reason for this is actually because of

1313
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,900
I believe the European Commission

1314
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:49,300
who was asking them about their faulty stuff.

1315
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,300
And this statement from the European Commission is full of cringe.

1316
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:55,820
So just cringe warning.

1317
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:01,580
Let's go. We've got news that's even better than finding a hidden one up mushroom.

1318
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:05,540
We've recently contacted Nintendo to address the reoccurring

1319
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,860
technical problems with defective switch controllers,

1320
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,660
and we're happy to report that they've agreed to offer consumer

1321
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:16,620
or all consumers the right to repair free of charge, even beyond legal guarantee.

1322
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:19,300
This will prevent the disposal of unrepaired controllers

1323
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,460
and unnecessary waste.

1324
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,460
So don't wait.

1325
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,780
Jump into action and get your controllers repaired for free.

1326
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,580
Stop with the cringe thing.

1327
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:28,500
It's your government entity enough.

1328
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,460
Enough. It's bad.

1329
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,580
It makes you look like hello, fellow kids, like just don't.

1330
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,220
Thank you for the trigger warning on that.

1331
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,660
I really wish I could have muted you.

1332
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,820
That was that was terrible.

1333
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:46,580
It's so bad. It's like it's just it's just awful.

1334
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,620
Oh, all right.

1335
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:52,660
Hey, at least you get to fix your your faulty controllers.

1336
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:55,300
Why is this still why is this still an issue?

1337
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,940
It's a great question, and this should really be here to you.

1338
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,460
This should be a thing here, too, honestly.

1339
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:07,180
All right, because like they yes, we understand that this happens a lot.

1340
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,300
But where are we doing anything about it?

1341
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,540
No, no, we're not doing anything about it.

1342
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,660
All right. Well, let's talk about something

1343
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,860
Nintendo won't repair, and that's your cell phone.

1344
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,380
And honestly, they may not be making many games for it either.

1345
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:24,100
It's it's hard to tell based on this statement.

1346
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:27,220
But Miyamoto was doing an interview with Variety.

1347
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,580
You know, again, this is a big Hollywood thing.

1348
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:33,620
And Miyamoto said that mobile apps will not be the primary path

1349
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:35,540
of future Mario games.

1350
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,260
Probably not a huge surprise based on the performance of Dr.

1351
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,100
Mario World, which was pulled, Super Mario Run,

1352
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,940
which didn't quite live up to expectations.

1353
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:45,540
I know it has its fans, but, you know, it didn't quite live up

1354
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:46,780
to expectations.

1355
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,980
They're saying that the strategy going forward is a, quote,

1356
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:51,860
hardware and software integrated gaming experience.

1357
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,420
What went wrong?

1358
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:58,140
Well, in the interview, Miyamoto basically blames control intuitiveness,

1359
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,260
something a lot of us were saying a long time ago.

1360
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,820
Could have told you that before you even put the game out.

1361
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:08,420
The quote here, when we explore the opportunity of making Mario

1362
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:12,060
games for the mobile phone, which is a more common generic device,

1363
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,260
it was challenging to determine what that game should be.

1364
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,300
That is why I played the role of director for Super Mario Run

1365
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,380
to be able to translate that Nintendo hardware experience

1366
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:23,340
to the smart devices.

1367
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:27,780
Very interesting little quote, because you really see Nintendo's philosophy

1368
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:31,260
in there about how they make games for their hardware,

1369
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:35,180
and they're going to show off their their hardware twist

1370
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,980
or whatever in the games that they make.

1371
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:37,740
That's for sure.

1372
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:41,020
It's a very interesting sort of thing in that statement.

1373
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:44,060
But, you know, also, we know this about Nintendo, right?

1374
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:46,980
So obviously, a cell phone was not something they designed

1375
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:50,700
and probably not something they particularly cared for

1376
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,180
in making some of these games, because, you know, like we said,

1377
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:57,180
you know, I'm not here to knock all cell phone games as bad.

1378
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,700
They're not. I enjoy and play plenty of them.

1379
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,980
But they're all designed with the limitations

1380
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,420
and structure of a cell phone in mind.

1381
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,820
I don't see it as much anymore.

1382
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:09,420
I feel like we're past that point where we're trying to shoehorn

1383
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,060
ports of old games into mobile phone.

1384
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:15,900
I feel like that era kind of came and went and good riddance, quite frankly,

1385
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,060
because I don't think any of those games are fun.

1386
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:22,340
But things that are fun are things like, you know, Pokemon Go.

1387
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,180
Recent controversy aside, I'm not stepping in that.

1388
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:28,620
But generally, that game was designed for a mobile phone.

1389
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,500
And a lot of the things about it is good.

1390
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:33,660
Dark Sakura's word game. Sure, it's great.

1391
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:36,380
It's designed for a mobile phone, you know,

1392
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:40,100
or say like a Words with Friends type of thing designed for that.

1393
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,860
You know, it's designed for that experience.

1394
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,460
And that's why those games work out well.

1395
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:48,860
Miyamoto did not comment

1396
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:51,220
on any of Nintendo's other mobile properties.

1397
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:55,420
Things like Animal Crossing, Pocket Camp and Fire Emblem Heroes,

1398
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,740
which, by the way, is the top earning mobile game for Nintendo.

1399
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,140
It crossed the one billion mark in June of last year.

1400
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,260
So that's that.

1401
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,900
Also in that interview, Miyamoto did not mention

1402
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,220
when a new Mario game would arrive, and that did remind me like

1403
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,020
very surprised

1404
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:16,220
Nintendo did not put out a new Mario game to go with this movie.

1405
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:19,940
Now, we saw the holiday coming up and Nintendo could announce something

1406
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,860
in the June season or whatever for the holidays,

1407
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:28,100
even if they repackage old shit, which Nintendo is not afraid to do.

1408
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:33,780
I'm really surprised Nintendo doesn't have something ready to go

1409
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:36,580
like now for this movie being out.

1410
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,900
Yeah, they did.

1411
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,220
Well, they don't because they've had opportunities

1412
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,140
and a whole director, you know, towards the movie. Sure.

1413
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:49,420
I hear rumors are supposed to be directed this week, but about Zelda.

1414
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:51,460
So that'd be interesting. Yeah.

1415
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:55,260
Yeah, I don't think they have a game coming anytime soon.

1416
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,860
Looney Barn and Chat says, isn't Mario Odyssey still fairly new?

1417
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:01,180
Oh, not at this point.

1418
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:03,780
I'm afraid it's it was a pre pandemic.

1419
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:05,940
It was a pre pandemic game to put it in perspective.

1420
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,980
Fine. The next game, the next Mario game is probably for their new console anyway.

1421
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,780
So it's probably being saved for that. Maybe.

1422
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,780
I was surprised they never did a Luigi's Odyssey or a sequel to

1423
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:18,060
Mario Odyssey in some capacity. I was really surprised.

1424
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:22,940
Pod Culture says they will announce it in time for the video release.

1425
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:26,700
Then that that that window is not what it used to be.

1426
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:30,860
Pod Culture just making sure you know what that that means in the next six weeks,

1427
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:33,860
because that Mario movie will be I think they've already said

1428
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:37,140
it's the first week of June for on demand, isn't it?

1429
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,100
Yeah. Like Ant-Man Quantumania is coming out pretty soon.

1430
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:41,140
Like the window.

1431
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:46,500
It used to be like six months to a year is now like three months, maybe. Yeah.

1432
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:50,300
DJ Rama S and Chat says, as much as I love the Mario movie,

1433
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,380
there really isn't the need for a video game tie in.

1434
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:56,140
I get that. Obviously, the box office proves that I get I get that,

1435
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:01,660
you know, but I'm just I'm surprised Nintendo isn't riding that wave.

1436
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:07,340
With I would love a Mario game like an open world Mario game

1437
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:11,500
in the vein of like a Breath of the Wild or something like that would be amazing.

1438
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,540
I think they could do something like this.

1439
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:18,500
Odyssey was kind of close, not totally, but it was more open world,

1440
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:23,380
you know, a little more that Mario 64 aesthetic. But yeah, I loved Odyssey.

1441
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,140
I loved it. I would love to see another one of those games.

1442
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,260
And I was good.

1443
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,220
There were those rumors sometimes ago about a Super Luigi's Odyssey.

1444
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,140
And I'm here for that. Like, I really wish that was true, but we'll see.

1445
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,860
So, yeah. All right.

1446
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,420
Well, we'll have to go back to a simple time for now, though,

1447
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:42,940
in our next segment. So let's get to it.

1448
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,300
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

1449
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:00,740
or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1450
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,860
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1451
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,460
And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?

1452
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:10,940
I picked Stryker's 1945.

1453
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:17,660
It was also known as Stryker 1945, but everywhere else it was Stryker's,

1454
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,900
plural. It is a vertical

1455
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,820
scrolling shooter.

1456
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:28,740
It was developed by Saikyo in 1995.

1457
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:34,340
In Japan, it came out on PlayStation and Sega Saturn by Atlas in 1996

1458
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,860
and also released as part of the Saikyo Shooting Collection.

1459
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:44,820
Volume one Stryker's 1945 1 and 2 by Taito for PlayStation 2.

1460
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:50,300
In Europe, it came out under Playit as 1945 1 and 2, the arcade games.

1461
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:54,620
There was the sequel Stryker's 1945 in 1997

1462
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,860
that in North America just came out as Stryker's 1945.

1463
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:03,540
And then Stryker's 1945 3 in 1999, which was

1464
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:08,620
and there was a second title remake called Stryker's 1945 Plus.

1465
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,660
So also more recently in 2022,

1466
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:17,500
the original arcade version was included in the Sega Astro City mini

1467
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,660
So there you go.

1468
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:28,460
Anyway, you play as one of several planes

1469
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,300
and each of them has three attacks.

1470
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,620
There's a normal shot, a charged shot and a bomb.

1471
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:36,540
It clears out the enemy and the bullets.

1472
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:39,900
Normal and charged shots can be strengthened by different power ups

1473
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,740
and gold bombs.

1474
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:45,340
You can get gold bars for bonus points.

1475
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:49,460
And when you defeat the final boss, your time, the number of gold bars,

1476
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,740
the number of enemies killed are added up for each level.

1477
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,700
And if it's high enough, you get a silver or gold medal.

1478
01:23:55,140 --> 01:24:00,340
In the Japanese arcade version, there is a hidden post credit bonus

1479
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:04,980
that can be unlocked if you beat the entire game without losing a life.

1480
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:08,740
And it shows all six of the pilots,

1481
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:13,940
which are five women and one man posing undressed.

1482
01:24:15,780 --> 01:24:17,260
Go Fig.

1483
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:22,300
But anyway, it's set in the summer of 1945 after World War Two.

1484
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:28,060
The world is in that sort of post-war piece.

1485
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:32,620
And then an organization called CANNY, C-A-N-Y,

1486
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,940
wants to take over the world with super weapons.

1487
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:42,660
And so. The the I guess it's the United Military

1488
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:47,260
is sending out people to go stop the bad guys.

1489
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:52,420
So, yeah, I mean, fairly simple, as you can see on the screen,

1490
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:57,140
those who are watching on Twitch, it's it's a shooter game.

1491
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:00,940
You play a plane, but it's it's still considered

1492
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:05,700
to be one of the most successful shooter games.

1493
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:10,540
In fact, in Japan, as of Game Machine's

1494
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,820
July 15th 1995 issue, it was considered the fourth most successful

1495
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,820
arcade game of the month.

1496
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,540
The Saturn version was highly lauded

1497
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,860
as a 92 out of 100 for its review.

1498
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,060
So there we go.

1499
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,100
Picked a quick one.

1500
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:31,820
If you want to know who was behind it, first of all.

1501
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:37,500
The director of the game was Yorichika Naozumi.

1502
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:43,500
It was developed by, like I said, by Psycho.

1503
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:46,820
There also is an iOS Android version by KMBox

1504
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,020
and a window version by City Connection.

1505
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:53,980
And I'll tell you what made me think of this is when I was going to pick up

1506
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,700
Osmond is that I saw they had two

1507
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,660
Psycho collections coming up for Switch are already out.

1508
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,300
And so I thought, why not?

1509
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,420
It's a fun one.

1510
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:06,900
It's a really great game and it's a two player game.

1511
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:10,740
But it was released on Psycho's first generation arcade system.

1512
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,980
Now, before we wrap up, because I and I apologize,

1513
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:17,780
I stepped out to do a bio break, as I usually do right about now.

1514
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:23,460
But I don't think this has no relation to Capcom's 1940 X series, right?

1515
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:27,180
No, this is a completely different company.

1516
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:30,300
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was it's interesting to me because

1517
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:34,820
it has that like element, obviously, if they're both World War Two games.

1518
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:37,220
Right. But I definitely get that whole like, oh, this feels like a

1519
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,100
maybe the word would be spiritual successor by fans or something.

1520
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,420
You know, I don't know what else to call it.

1521
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:47,940
Don't. When did 19 1943 come out?

1522
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,380
Oh, the first game was like 1984 is very old.

1523
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:56,660
This this is I'm not even going to call it.

1524
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:01,540
Yeah, actually, Orange Wright just just nailed it similar to Aero Fighters.

1525
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:07,700
OK, the but I mean, it's easy to look at a playing game

1526
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:12,020
set in the 40s and say that it's related.

1527
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:18,820
I actually think that this game, it's a pretty fun shooter.

1528
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:21,060
Of course, I'm no good at it because I suck at shooters,

1529
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:24,940
but it has a lot of challenge and, you know,

1530
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,820
some pretty good music in it.

1531
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:30,060
And it's just a really tight game.

1532
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,660
I mean, I have played an original of it.

1533
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:37,140
And is the arcade version just so clean?

1534
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:40,260
Of course, if you want the best at home version, you get it on Saturn.

1535
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:42,380
All right. There it is.

1536
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:45,500
Your classic game of the week, Strikers, 1945.

1537
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,900
Admittedly, not one I was super familiar with.

1538
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,100
So I learned something.

1539
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,620
I always thought, though, that the company's psycho, that their name was so funny.

1540
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,820
Because not necessarily spelled that way.

1541
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:01,580
There's this P S I K Y O, but the word psycho means the greatest.

1542
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:05,260
So, yeah. All right.

1543
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:10,420
Well, we were going to get into some more rapid fire news,

1544
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,260
but it looks like Loki stepped away for a minute.

1545
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:15,420
So I guess I got to buy some time.

1546
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,100
That's OK. You know, I'll get mine out of the way.

1547
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:19,860
Usually that segment goes a little longer.

1548
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:20,980
Sure. We'll start with Dark Sakura.

1549
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:23,580
We'll get into some rapid fire news special.

1550
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:24,900
We'll start with you. Sure.

1551
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,180
All right. Well, you know, we were all up in arms

1552
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:31,220
about trying to get the eShop stuff done.

1553
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:35,660
But Pokemon Stadium being one of the first Pokemon spinoff games

1554
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:39,660
is actually coming to Switch owners via the Switch online

1555
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:44,620
plus expansion pack subscription service starting on April 12th,

1556
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,020
which is this upcoming Friday.

1557
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:52,620
And it will be accessible via the Nintendo 64 app

1558
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,700
with, you know, if you've got the subscription,

1559
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:58,980
all you have to do is update the app next week and you can pick it up.

1560
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,580
Nice. All right.

1561
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:08,420
I yeah, I might have to I still not am not on the extended

1562
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:12,980
Nintendo thing with expansion pack, whatever it's called, but Pokemon Stadium.

1563
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:16,460
That's one that's tempting to get it for. All right.

1564
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,300
Loki, let's go to your rapid fire news stories now that you're settled back in.

1565
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:24,940
Yeah. So the murder of Sonic had a murder of Sonic,

1566
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:28,020
the hedgehog game that came out last week for April Fools

1567
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:30,860
has actually surpassed one million downloads.

1568
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:35,540
It's one of the highest rated Sonic games on Steam right now.

1569
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:41,100
And the number 61 highest rated game on Steam of all time.

1570
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,700
Pretty unexpected, I think.

1571
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:48,700
So really unexpected happens all the time.

1572
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,300
I mean, it's how we got how to full boyfriend.

1573
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:55,420
I mean, I don't think Sega expected that it would be this popular,

1574
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:57,500
but yeah, it's pretty cool.

1575
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:03,180
And then the Final Fantasy pixel remaster PlayStation four and switch.

1576
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:06,900
They have a release date of April 19th

1577
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,260
and they will include my birthday.

1578
01:30:10,820 --> 01:30:15,420
Yes. And they will include a new font setting as well.

1579
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:22,300
New fonts. And I think there was an intro credits or something like that.

1580
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:28,220
All right. Well, I got one more story for you,

1581
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:32,100
and it has to do with Overwatch or specifically Overwatch two.

1582
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,220
I'm not sure how many of you are playing Overwatch two,

1583
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:38,660
but we have the announcement of a new hero for Overwatch two, who is Life Weaver,

1584
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:42,260
a Thai scientist who has long hair

1585
01:30:42,260 --> 01:30:45,300
and a sense of style, confidence and bravado.

1586
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,780
And you see him in the trailer.

1587
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:51,020
He uses plant themed powers to restore health.

1588
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:53,780
And also, I guess he can like lift people up with a flower petal.

1589
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:56,300
It's kind of like a thing that he uses as well.

1590
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:01,220
Also important to point out, Life Weaver is in the game's lore pansexual.

1591
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:05,700
So as the first pan character, I guess openly pan character in the game,

1592
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:11,020
although I swear some voice interactions from chatting was was farmed with Batiste

1593
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,940
and it sounded like the two of them were flirting in the little

1594
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:17,660
dialogue that was going back and forth.

1595
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:20,220
So, you know, that's cool.

1596
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:24,740
I mean, I guess my point is, is that like if you're really upset about gay beer,

1597
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:28,220
then wait until I tell you that in Overwatch, everybody is gay.

1598
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:29,940
And that's a fact.

1599
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:34,420
All right. But check out Life Weaver coming out soon to the game.

1600
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,100
Actually, it does look like a cool mechanic.

1601
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:40,060
I wish I was better at Overwatch two, but I'm not.

1602
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:43,420
All right. Let's travel around the world.

1603
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,460
I still refuse to touch anything from Activision

1604
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,900
until after the merger goes through. Yeah.

1605
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,700
I can't because Diablo, but also

1606
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,820
just, well, and I think I've talked about this before,

1607
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:58,060
hearing from some people that are on the inside.

1608
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:01,340
I've heard about some of the tangible changes that are happening.

1609
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,860
So it's nice to see that they are making changes.

1610
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,500
But yes, I am a matter of principle because of a certain somebody.

1611
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:10,020
Sure, I understand.

1612
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:13,420
All right. Well, moving on, let's travel around the world

1613
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,060
and check out some stuff that's coming out a little sooner.

1614
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:17,860
World release dates.

1615
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,180
Loki, we'll start with you in the U.S. and what's coming out here.

1616
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:25,180

Legacy Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.

1625
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:04,780
All right. Traveling to Japan, I seem to remember last week was pretty

1626
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,700
and there wasn't a lot, but this week we have some releases again.

1627
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:11,460
So on the 13th, on the Nintendo Switch, we have Osmond coming in.

1628
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,660
I think this is is this the one that you ordered, Dark Sakura?

1629
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:16,260
Yes, it absolutely is.

1630
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:18,500
So, OK, so that's coming out in Japan this week.

1631
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,100
There's a special there's a regular and a special edition.

1632
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,740
So I don't know if this is the special edition has like

1633
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:27,860
a really long poster and an art book and some stuff.

1634
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:31,860
It's it's like it's like 60 bucks.

1635
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,940
And then the the standard one's like 30.

1636
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,540
It wasn't very expensive. Hmm.

1637
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:40,660
I was just taking a peek here, showing folks what that might look like there.

1638
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:43,700
For those that are watching a twitch.tv slash vog network.

1639
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:45,420
That's also out on PlayStation four.

1640
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,500
I should point out as well as the switch, of course.

1641
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,820
I ordered the Switch one.

1642
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:51,540
Yeah. All right.

1643
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,140
Some other games coming out this week on the Switch include

1644
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:56,780
a Senju no Waltz for the Nintendo Switch.

1645
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,820
There's a regular and a special edition for that.

1646
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:03,700
There's also Castle of Shikigami 2 comes out this week from Konami.

1647
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:08,620
Dokapon Kingdom Connect is out this week, as is Aiden Chronicle Rising

1648
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:11,660
is released over there as well this week.

1649
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:16,540
And Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is also out in Japan this week

1650
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:18,500
as it makes its way to the US as well.

1651
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,060
That is everything on the switch.

1652
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:23,900
But quickly, looking at the PlayStation five, we also have Atomic Heart

1653
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:26,780
in regular and limited edition, making its way out

1654
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:29,620
for the PlayStation five this week.

1655
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:32,140
And that's it.

1656
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,820
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1657
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:39,420
Only two things on the list on the 13th for

1658
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:42,180
I guess this is computer.

1659
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:46,020
It's X-Plane 12, but I have no idea what that is.

1660
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:47,260
It's a flight simulator.

1661
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:50,780
And then on the 14th for PlayStation Switch, we have Cult of the Lamb.

1662
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,420
Oh, cool.

1663
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:54,820
That's going to be my palate cleanser.

1664
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:59,620
It's here in my my my subathon because I fucking love that game.

1665
01:34:59,620 --> 01:35:01,380
It's so great.

1666
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:04,060
All right. I have the soundtrack on vinyl.

1667
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:05,940
Oh, fun. Yeah.

1668
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:07,260
And I'm supposed to be.

1669
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:10,140
I didn't I don't remember if I ordered the plushie.

1670
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,900
No, I didn't order the plushie, but I got the soundtrack.

1671
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:15,100
I need to get a record player. That would be fun.

1672
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,660
But then I'm like a record player to play all these damn records.

1673
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,220
I don't need another thing to spend more money on. All right.

1674
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,340
You can get a good one for not very expensive.

1675
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:25,940
I know. Then that opens the door to vinyl collection.

1676
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,380
That's the problem.

1677
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:31,540
I I've been collecting vinyl without having a record player, Rob.

1678
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:33,580
I have I have records already.

1679
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:37,100
I know I have two, two records, two records, both of them.

1680
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,900
And one of them I got you and the other one I bought in Seattle.

1681
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:43,900
Yep. The other one I bought in Seattle.

1682
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:48,420
I still wish that I had bought the Wendy Carlos album.

1683
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,260
The only reason I didn't buy it was because it had been published

1684
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:52,980
under her dead name. Mm hmm.

1685
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,100
But I still wish I had.

1686
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,860
I would I would kill for a first printing of Switched on Bach.

1687
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,140
Yeah, I would. You should.

1688
01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:04,220
I mean, not that you're going to be in Seattle anytime soon, but if you are,

1689
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:07,420
there was an awesome record store at the Pike Market that I went to

1690
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:09,700
that would probably have it, you know.

1691
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:12,220
So if you're still interested in finding that, so.

1692
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:17,340
There's a good place in Oakland that's near the the where the the park

1693
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,940
where they have the farmer's market, I could go buy two.

1694
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:22,940
But that's where I got

1695
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:28,260
my my Xanadu soundtrack on vinyl.

1696
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:32,860
I actually do not know the name that that album would have been published under.

1697
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:36,060
Don't. But same last name.

1698
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,500
Yeah, OK. It would have been OK.

1699
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,980
So as long as I know the last name and the name of the album, I could find it.

1700
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:45,820
So if I'm ever in Seattle again, I may I may actually go to Seattle.

1701
01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:47,740
There's a big Ingers thing up there in September,

1702
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:50,100
but it's literally the week after Dragon Con.

1703
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,780
But I have enough, I've been on so many flights,

1704
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:57,300
I have enough frequent flyer points to like have a trip to Seattle.

1705
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,660
I might do it. We'll see.

1706
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:00,100
Take me with you.

1707
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:02,740
Alan will be pissed if I go without him because we have friends up there.

1708
01:37:02,740 --> 01:37:04,740
So I don't know. I don't know. We'll see.

1709
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:05,780
All right. All right.

1710
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:07,740
Well, I sent you the the the name.

1711
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:10,220
OK. All right. Moving on.

1712
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:14,340
Let's check out our next story here.

1713
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:16,100
Loki. Yep.

1714
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,660
So we're starting to get news

1715
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:20,860
of other non E3 events that are going to be happening.

1716
01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:25,780
So Gamescom opening night live 2023 has been confirmed

1717
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:31,420
by Jeff Keighley to be returning August 22nd.

1718
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:35,460
And of course, that's going to be taking place in

1719
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:39,060
Kondamesi, Germany.

1720
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:41,860
He's busy. Yep, he's busy.

1721
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:44,180
So that'd be cool. I can't wait to see that.

1722
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:47,060
He has to replace E3 and open Gamescom.

1723
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:49,300
That's that's busy. Does he sleep?

1724
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:53,260
I don't know. No, he doesn't.

1725
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:57,820
And then, of course, I sometimes I wonder all dozens of you,

1726
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:02,900
I'm sure excited to hear that the PC gaming show is coming back June 11th.

1727
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:03,980
So that's right.

1728
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:08,060
We're going to be able to see some PC game titles, I guess

1729
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:11,580
hosted by Sean Plot.

1730
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:15,940
Well, could I actually I have a wild theory.

1731
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:20,500
Could the absence of E3 and some of these other pomp and circumstance

1732
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,540
actually make this show better?

1733
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:26,420
No, because last year they didn't have E3 and it was not good.

1734
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:29,180
So I don't think so. Fair.

1735
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:33,260
Got shut me up. All right.

1736
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,340
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1737
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:39,620
Well, it is it is some sad news.

1738
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:43,860
It was announced that American McGee's

1739
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:47,060
works at trying to make a third installment

1740
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:50,020
of the Alice series is quote at an end.

1741
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:55,140
There was a statement on on McGee's Patreon

1742
01:38:55,140 --> 01:38:58,580
that said that he had, and this is the quote,

1743
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,940
exhausted every option for getting a new Alice game made

1744
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:06,380
after EA reportedly decided to pass on the project

1745
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:09,420
based on an internal analysis of the IP market

1746
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:13,220
market conditions and details of the production proposal.

1747
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:20,060
So he he's I mean, basically, they're like

1748
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:23,780
they talked with EA about the efforts to get the new game

1749
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:29,220
and were presented with the design Bible and production plan.

1750
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:34,140
And it had the the schedule, the budget, the team, the design for everything.

1751
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:40,100
EA reviewed it and came back denying the licensing for Alice Asylum.

1752
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,980
So they are are passing it on.

1753
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,820
Well, that's a bummer.

1754
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:50,780
Yeah, they have a really, really good series. Yeah.

1755
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:55,260
I don't I feel like that can't be gone forever,

1756
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,500
but it's going to be a while for sure. So.

1757
01:40:00,020 --> 01:40:03,580
All right. Moving on to news that is also frustrating.

1758
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:07,100
Loki. Yes.

1759
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:11,820
So Monster Energy is a very litigious company

1760
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:13,900
and has a monster legal department.

1761
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:18,580
They attack anybody that uses the word monster,

1762
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:21,780
especially if they're defenseless indie developers.

1763
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:23,860
And so that's what they've done here.

1764
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:27,700
They have basically gone after glowstick entertainment's

1765
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:31,860
2020 game, Dark Deception, Monsters and Mortals,

1766
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:34,260
because I know the first thing I hear

1767
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:38,580
or think of when I hear that is their energy drink, of course.

1768
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,700
You mean they're nasty canopies?

1769
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:44,340
What are these? What are they going to do? Sue Halloween?

1770
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:44,940
Like, I don't.

1771
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:47,740
Are they going to sue the Spirit Store for selling monster costumes?

1772
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:50,140
I tried suing a lot of people.

1773
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:51,940
Get over it.

1774
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:56,660
They should have to pay for all these fucking terrible lawsuits.

1775
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:59,780
I mean, if somebody is putting out a drink named Monster, then fine.

1776
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:02,420
You're with the word monster and then find that never been.

1777
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:05,340
Well, they should they should never hurt their fucking IP.

1778
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:09,820
Well, they should never have let them have Monster as a trademark.

1779
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,460
Monster Energy should be a trademark.

1780
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:15,100
But Monster itself should have a generic for that.

1781
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:19,420
But of course, our our copyright and trademark system is broken.

1782
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:22,740
And so because of that, you have people like Monster,

1783
01:41:22,980 --> 01:41:25,380
you know, registering that as a trademark.

1784
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:29,540
And you have to say, did they sue Lady Gaga?

1785
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:32,420
She ate my heart, doo doo doo doo.

1786
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:34,220
Well, I mean, her little monsters.

1787
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:35,780
That boy is a monster.

1788
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,900
She has a song called Monster.

1789
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,820
Yeah, it'd be different if like this thing was like,

1790
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:46,180
you know, like Monster Energy, something or other like it was the name of the game.

1791
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,300
Then I would understand.

1792
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:50,020
But this is just completely ridiculous.

1793
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:51,540
And then on top of that, you know.

1794
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:56,460
Sorry, Marissa Chat says Monster was the employment website for old people like me.

1795
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:58,260
Oh, my God. True. That's right.

1796
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,940
There was a monster was like the yeah.

1797
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:02,980
Monster.com. Yeah.

1798
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:05,780
No, no, I'm older than you.

1799
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,020
Please do not. Please do not.

1800
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:12,580
Yeah. We're old enough to remember when you found a job in the paper.

1801
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,900
And Monster.com.

1802
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:19,140
They also filed a lawsuit with at one time.

1803
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:24,140
They they filed lawsuits against, you know, lots of different things.

1804
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:28,860
Everything from like restaurants to websites, the forums, the games to.

1805
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:33,460
I think they even tried to maybe sue Disney or Pixar about Monsters Inc.

1806
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:37,980
But, you know, for some reason, they're still around suing people.

1807
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:41,980
So, of course, you know, they've basically

1808
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,620
been giving an agreement or whatever it says.

1809
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:50,020
The overreaching settlement terms that Monster Energy sent the company

1810
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:52,900
was basically demands in exchange for allowing us to use the name

1811
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,380
Monsters and Mortals.

1812
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:59,700
We never we agree never to name any other game, any variation of the word monster.

1813
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:04,260
Also, it forces us to never use a green and white logo

1814
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:06,900
on black background for any game we ever make.

1815
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,220
So they're saying that they own those colors, too, apparently.

1816
01:43:11,780 --> 01:43:14,620
They can they can trademark a color

1817
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:17,820
like Barbie Pink is is owned by Mattel.

1818
01:43:18,380 --> 01:43:22,100
OK, but I don't think that they say that they can't make a game,

1819
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:26,020
even if it's not named Monster, that they can't make a game with those colors.

1820
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,740
Like their logo.

1821
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:30,260
I just think that's overreaching.

1822
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:34,340
So it's just all companies like Monster Energy depend on doing their bullying

1823
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:39,300
and secret while presenting a clean image to their base athletes and gamers.

1824
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:42,660
Showing their true face publicly is the only way to stop them.

1825
01:43:42,660 --> 01:43:46,660
And unfortunately, it won't be because they will, you know, do it.

1826
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:51,060
But apparently the CEO of glow sick entertainment says they've filed

1827
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:54,060
for summary of judgment to hopefully move the thing along.

1828
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,060
So it's not being dragged out legally.

1829
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:58,940
They need somebody needs to counter Sue to get them

1830
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,180
to lose that trademark because it can happen.

1831
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:07,220
I mean, honestly, there's Monster Energy than Monster Cables at one time.

1832
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:08,100
Like, yeah, I'm right.

1833
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:10,820
And Monster Cables used to sue everybody as well.

1834
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:14,020
I would like to see a battle between Monster Cable and Monster Energy,

1835
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:19,860
you know, and then just just get rid of like nullify the trademark.

1836
01:44:19,900 --> 01:44:23,420
Nintendo needs to release a game called Monster, and then they can all fuck off

1837
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:26,140
together into eternal legal.

1838
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:33,940
I'm surprised that they did end up suing Pixar or whatever for Monsters, Inc.

1839
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:35,620
that they didn't like get shut down.

1840
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,820
I'm kind of surprised.

1841
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:39,900
Yeah, the Disney Disney lawyers are scary, too.

1842
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:44,020
And I'm kind of surprised they will eat them up better about death.

1843
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,660
Deft is saying Pokemon.

1844
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,740
They went after Pokemon pocket monsters.

1845
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:49,780
Are you shitting me?

1846
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:51,900
How do they still have the I don't know.

1847
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,820
Anyway, energy drinks aren't good for you.

1848
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:59,220
I say I say as I literally down an entire coffee on this program.

1849
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:01,900
Coffee is not an energy drink.

1850
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,140
No, it's not. Yeah.

1851
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,580
Is the is right is the energy drink.

1852
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:08,540
The only one I accept.

1853
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,780
I don't drink. I've been buying coffee on Etsy, by the way.

1854
01:45:10,780 --> 01:45:12,860
I don't drink that other shit because of coffee.

1855
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:14,100
Just pointing out. All right.

1856
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:19,180
I I put my faith in coffee, which sustains me. Mm hmm.

1857
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:21,340
All right. Thank you, Chad.

1858
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:23,620
Chad is backing me up. Chad is backing me up.

1859
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:24,860
I appreciate you all.

1860
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:26,500
Rob Coffee.

1861
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,820
Tiger Claw in chat says, is it decaf?

1862
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:30,660
Don't insult me.

1863
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:32,900
I'm just kidding.

1864
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,100
No, it is not decaf.

1865
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,060
I've I've been a little detour.

1866
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:39,860
I've been stepping up my coffee game and I ordered blue mountain coffee

1867
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:43,980
on Etsy and Kona coffee for in K cups.

1868
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,260
And it's delightful.

1869
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:50,180
And it supports small roasters.

1870
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:54,420
And it's a little bit more expensive, but you get some damn fine coffee.

1871
01:45:54,820 --> 01:45:58,780
I do drink decaf once in a great while, but like late at night,

1872
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:01,580
like eight o'clock, like that's late.

1873
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:03,060
Eight is late.

1874
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:05,260
Well, like relative to bedtime. Yes.

1875
01:46:06,660 --> 01:46:11,020
No, I keep decaf on hand for when Becky comes over

1876
01:46:11,860 --> 01:46:15,420
like to make half calves. Yeah.

1877
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,980
And I will do a decaf

1878
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:21,540
if I'm cold and it's like midnight.

1879
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:26,940
But I also buy good decaf and not shitty decaf.

1880
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:31,060
Yeah. You know what?

1881
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:31,980
I don't like.

1882
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:34,820
OK, first of all, I saw Rhonda's thing.

1883
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:37,300
We have Keurig's at work, so I buy boxes of variety K cups.

1884
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:40,620
I do not like the Dunkin K cups and I do not like Starbucks

1885
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:45,460
regular coffee at all because it tastes burnt or dead.

1886
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:48,380
I do like their espresso drinks,

1887
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:52,700
but I must say that I am very, very fond of their iced coffee.

1888
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,820
I've been getting what's that one brand?

1889
01:46:57,820 --> 01:46:59,260
Is it Green Mountain?

1890
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:00,780
Not that they endorse this or anything.

1891
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:03,580
I think that that's the same company as Keurig.

1892
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:05,740
So it's it's their own company, coffee company.

1893
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:09,620
But I like the Green Mountain and Gevalia,

1894
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:14,180
the Swiss company and donut shop.

1895
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:16,260
My favorite. Not that they're paying me.

1896
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:17,580
And I don't remember the exact name.

1897
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:20,780
I just know it's the Hawaiian coffee and it comes in the foil bag

1898
01:47:20,780 --> 01:47:22,900
and the K cups are a little more recyclable.

1899
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:25,300
That is like they have like macadamia nut.

1900
01:47:25,780 --> 01:47:28,300
That is the best. It's like Kona or something.

1901
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:31,820
That is by far the best one. Yeah. For me.

1902
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:36,700
Well, at any at any rate, though, I fucking love coffee.

1903
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,540
I like that my I like that my palate,

1904
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:43,620
because I've been drinking less of it because of my stomach.

1905
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:48,100
That I've like begun like actually tasting the different flavors

1906
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:50,460
and like I'm becoming a bit of a coffee snob.

1907
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:52,860
I hear you the other day.

1908
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:57,500
So Friday, I know that I have told many people that

1909
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:01,580
that they overroast their coffee to make them last longer Friday,

1910
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:05,060
which was the start of the third day of deliberations in our trial.

1911
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:09,060
I got a Starbucks that morning and then at lunch.

1912
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,820
Well, we didn't know if we would be done or not yet.

1913
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:12,900
I also had a Dutch brothers at lunch.

1914
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:17,660
I had two designer coffees on Friday because it was that kind of day.

1915
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:22,140
Did I deserve it? Yes, I did.

1916
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:24,100
Every every last drop. Yes, I did.

1917
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:28,100
To coffee lounge radio.

1918
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,180
I love coffee. All right.

1919
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:33,540
You know, it's even better than you know, it's better than any of this stuff

1920
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,700
is going to is gay brunch.

1921
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,740
No gay brunch. A French press.

1922
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:41,140
That is the best coffee in there.

1923
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:44,060
No, like, no, it's just no actual fresh fresh.

1924
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,140
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1925
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:48,580
Yeah. Clever, clever drip is better than French press.

1926
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:51,340
Oh, I will fight you on this

1927
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,620
on immersion.

1928
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:53,740
I'll drink any coffee.

1929
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:55,660
I'll drink any coffee except Folgers.

1930
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,540
Otherwise, I'll drink any coffee.

1931
01:48:58,180 --> 01:48:59,580
Phil's coffee.

1932
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:01,380
You and I are going to love Phil's.

1933
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:04,340
I love Phil's. There's one downtown.

1934
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,780
Yeah, that's it.

1935
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:08,900
We're doing brunch next Sunday.

1936
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:11,140
They finally they finally opened

1937
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:15,860
the new place under what used to be sidetracks downtown.

1938
01:49:16,820 --> 01:49:17,460
That's fine.

1939
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:19,820
It's going to make the hamburgers.

1940
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:24,380
It is it's a burger place, but it's I think if they don't do a drag

1941
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:26,940
queen brunch and they're in the wrong part of fucking town,

1942
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,700
that is all I know.

1943
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:30,380
All right, Rob, we're going to brunch.

1944
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,540
All right. Sounds good. Let's do it.

1945
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:35,900
All right. Moving on one more thing.

1946
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:40,420
I don't know how to tie this into brunch, so I'm just not going to bother trying.

1947
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:44,220
But what could the future of PlayStation controllers look like?

1948
01:49:44,620 --> 01:49:48,100
Could they actually change temperature?

1949
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:51,220
Yep. It's a new patent that Sony has filed

1950
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:53,700
that talks about how this technology would work.

1951
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:57,260
It would have a elastic member on the controller.

1952
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:01,300
The elastic could actually change shape, and that's something

1953
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:03,220
that could happen as well.

1954
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:05,780
And then also there would be a sensor that would talk about

1955
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:08,460
if the elastic is touched, twisted, pressed, pinched,

1956
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:11,780
washed or rub and measure things like acceleration.

1957
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:17,460
But then also as a part of this, the elastic piece has vibration capabilities

1958
01:50:17,460 --> 01:50:21,940
and this intensity could actually cause the controller to heat up.

1959
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:25,860
So the gel material in the elastic could actually change and heat up

1960
01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:27,700
and make it more firm.

1961
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,980
So it could be interesting if you're in like a volcano level

1962
01:50:29,980 --> 01:50:31,580
at a type of game or something like that,

1963
01:50:31,580 --> 01:50:33,940
where the controller could actually get hotter.

1964
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:36,940
That would be interesting. It sounds like a safety nightmare.

1965
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:41,500
But children, well, sometimes all you need

1966
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,740
is the power of suggestion, right?

1967
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:47,900
Like take a take a ride like Star Tours,

1968
01:50:48,060 --> 01:50:50,660
even though sometimes it feels like you're moving like this.

1969
01:50:51,620 --> 01:50:55,100
When you actually write, it's very subtle movements on Star Tours,

1970
01:50:55,100 --> 01:51:00,340
but watching the screen and if you are a really real Disney freak,

1971
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:03,100
like some of us used to be, at least anyway here on OLR,

1972
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:06,140
try riding the ride with your eyes closed sometime

1973
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:08,180
and you'll feel just how subtle the movements are.

1974
01:51:08,660 --> 01:51:11,460
Because when you're watching the screen, though,

1975
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:15,060
you feel like you're like completely into it.

1976
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:17,820
And I would say this is the same thing with the temperature change.

1977
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:22,420
It only has to go up a little hotter to really get that impression of heat.

1978
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:26,580
I remember the old pinball table Whirlwind.

1979
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,340
I think it was what was called, right?

1980
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:29,420
Yeah, Whirlwind had the fan on it.

1981
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,940
Had the fan on it.

1982
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:33,740
And like, it's just this tiny ass shitty little fan.

1983
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:36,820
But when it blows air on you, you know, you're kind of like,

1984
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:38,980
and she, uh oh, looks like rain.

1985
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:41,220
And you say, oh, there's a storm coming.

1986
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:44,660
So when they had

1987
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:47,660
not California Extreme, but

1988
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:51,460
and not Golden, because Golden State Pinball Festival is coming up next month.

1989
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:55,100
But the other one, the Pinna-Go-Go, thank you.

1990
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:58,580
When they had that in Dixon in that, you know,

1991
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:02,540
non air conditioned place

1992
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:06,300
with all the corn pollen everywhere, which is why I don't do that one anymore.

1993
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:10,100
There'd be a line around Whirlwind when it got hot.

1994
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:15,020
Because you just want that fan blowing at you the whole time.

1995
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:16,740
Yeah, for sure.

1996
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:19,020
Yeah, we used to have a Whirlwind.

1997
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:22,340
All right. Well, that was our last slotted story for tonight.

1998
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:24,260
So it's time for the listener roundtable.

1999
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:28,460
We're going to open up and for your emails, participate at orange.ontrady.com.

2000
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:32,660
But we also welcome your phone calls on our Discord server, vog.network.com.

2001
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:35,060
That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

2002
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:37,780
And if you want to call in tonight, you can head over to the green room.

2003
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,940
And so that's a place where you can interact with our show tonight, too.

2004
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,340
Also, I will. Well, let me check.

2005
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:45,980
I don't think we had emails tonight, but I'm going to check in anyway,

2006
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,140
just as I always do. We had spam.

2007
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:48,980
Well, that doesn't count.

2008
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:51,220
I mean, I'll refresh it right now and see.

2009
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:54,420
But nope, nothing in there but the dust bunnies.

2010
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:55,980
We ain't got shit. All right.

2011
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:57,980
Participate at orange.ontrady.com

2012
01:52:57,980 --> 01:53:00,700
if you would like to put something in our box for next week.

2013
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,580
SSG100Matt says, what was the snowmobile game that was like Hydro Thunder

2014
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:07,820
that had a cooling fans during gameplay?

2015
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,460
Yeah, it was Arctic Thunder, wasn't it?

2016
01:53:09,460 --> 01:53:11,780
Mm hmm. Yeah, I think it was.

2017
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,300
It was Arctic Thunder logical.

2018
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,780
Let me see. I thought that they were missing an opportunity

2019
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:20,780
not having like a big ass fan unit on Alpine Racer.

2020
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:24,140
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's a throwback.

2021
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:29,420
All right. Let's go quickly over to Loki with some last minute stories,

2022
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:33,180
and I actually see at least one question in chat here for a discussion topic.

2023
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:34,300
I'll get to that in a moment.

2024
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:37,300
But Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to?

2025
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:41,420
Just a screenshot, a little bit of footage from what appears to be

2026
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:45,100
like an internal video from, I believe,

2027
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:51,460
Sega. It's showing a remake of Jet Set Radio

2028
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:55,340
and also a remake of Persona three,

2029
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:59,940
which apparently someone says that also the website

2030
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:02,180
for the persona three remake has been

2031
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:04,340
registered as well.

2032
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:06,220
So maybe that coming soon.

2033
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:08,780
But the the video, at least a little bit of animation

2034
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:12,420
they had for the Jet Set Radio remake looks awesome.

2035
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:14,740
All right.

2036
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:19,060
Mike Deft in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network

2037
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:22,660
asks, we're heading towards the it's off the screen.

2038
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:26,100
Sorry, we're heading towards the end of the first quarter of the year.

2039
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:30,980
What's the game or games you've liked the most so far this year?

2040
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:32,860
Good question.

2041
01:54:33,580 --> 01:54:36,660
For me, Diablo four, which is kind of cheating

2042
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:38,780
because that game hasn't actually come out yet.

2043
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:42,780
But y'all know those games are my jam and the beta did happen.

2044
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:46,420
And so I already know this is going to be a game that is definitely up my alley.

2045
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:51,020
Otherwise, to give another maybe a better answer, I don't know,

2046
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:53,740
for lack of better term for your question, I would say maybe Hi-Fi Rush

2047
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:56,180
would probably be the game for a lot of people on their list,

2048
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,500
which, of course, was the surprise rhythm game

2049
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:01,700
action game release that was released

2050
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:05,260
by the folks that used to do the Evil Within and those games.

2051
01:55:05,260 --> 01:55:08,820
That was the stealth game pass release that came out a couple of months ago.

2052
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:12,540
I would bet Hi-Fi Rush is probably going to end up on a lot of people's lists

2053
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:15,020
if you would ask that same question.

2054
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:17,620
Dark Soccer, Loki, anything you'd want to add to that for like

2055
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:21,420
great games so far this year?

2056
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:23,780
No, because I really haven't played anything new.

2057
01:55:24,340 --> 01:55:25,340
I played my inbox.

2058
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:28,220
Still catching up from last year, which is fair.

2059
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:28,820
So what happens?

2060
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:31,580
I like playing my Midnight Suns, and that makes me happy.

2061
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:34,940
So, oh, my God, how did I forget theater them?

2062
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:38,340
How did I forget theater them?

2063
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:42,060
Because it's always so much in your brain that you think of it all the time,

2064
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:43,740
and so you become desensitized.

2065
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:47,020
Yes. Correct answer. Yes.

2066
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:48,460
I'm I don't know.

2067
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:52,060
I haven't played any new games this year, so I'm just going to,

2068
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:54,060
because I was scrolling through Twitter

2069
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:58,140
and this happens to be the game that's shown in front of me here.

2070
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,260
I'm going to say paparazzi.

2071
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:04,500
It is a game where you take pictures of dogs wearing hats and glasses.

2072
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:07,420
I saw that. I was like, what the hell is this?

2073
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:09,700
Looks great. All right.

2074
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:12,620
I'm going to.

2075
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:16,020
So we had a redeemed post show shout out in our chat.

2076
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:19,460
I'm going to upgrade that to an on show shout out for free on the house.

2077
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:24,020
Marissa said, I need more social media followers for my voice acting work.

2078
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:25,540
Anyone want to follow?

2079
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:27,820
I'm at Marissa Meisel everywhere.

2080
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:32,820
Thanks. That's M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.

2081
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:34,620
Here it is. Get your pen ready one more time.

2082
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:38,620
M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.

2083
01:56:38,620 --> 01:56:43,740
Hit that 30 seconds backward button if you missed it and give Marissa all the follows.

2084
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:47,260
Because I would love to see Marissa get more.

2085
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:49,340
I mean, she's already done some great voice acting work.

2086
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,620
I would love to see her get some of the big gigs.

2087
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:55,220
I want to see Marissa retire to a life of convention circuits

2088
01:56:55,580 --> 01:56:57,180
like all the big voice actors.

2089
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:59,500
Marissa deserves that and more so.

2090
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:05,020
All right. Anyway, all right, well, I think I think, believe it or not,

2091
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:07,740
it's a little bit shorter of a show tonight, but that's OK.

2092
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,620
It was a little lighter with the news because everybody's

2093
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:13,700
busy at the movies seeing that movie and so forth.

2094
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:17,660
So I want to thank everybody for participating along with our show tonight,

2095
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:20,420
whether you were listening, whether you were here live with us on Sunday night,

2096
01:57:20,420 --> 01:57:22,260
whether you are lurking.

2097
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:24,380
Hey, we love you all. Thanks for being a part of the show.

2098
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,500
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

2099
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:28,420
please tell a friend or two about the show.

2100
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:31,260
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2101
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:33,380
but we need more voices to put out here on air.

2102
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:37,100
So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is

2103
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:39,420
you found this podcast, Spotify, whatever.

2104
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:42,420
I guess Spotify lets you leave comments on individual episodes now.

2105
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:43,660
I haven't really looked into that much,

2106
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:46,660
but if somebody leaves us a comment, I'll go look for it.

2107
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:49,500
Do that. Say nice things.

2108
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,340
If you leave a nasty comment, I'm ignoring it.

2109
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:53,660
So but that's yeah,

2110
01:57:55,580 --> 01:57:57,020
those going off a long way.

2111
01:57:57,020 --> 01:57:57,900
So thank you so much.

2112
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:00,460
That's that's all I got.

2113
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:03,180
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2114
01:58:03,460 --> 01:58:06,820
Dark Sakura, who I know is going to go off to play some dead by daylight.

2115
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:07,940
I'll start with you.

2116
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:10,380
What is your final thought for tonight?

2117
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,780
About my subathon, because I want people to hang out.

2118
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:16,300
And it's not the subs are like not really the most important thing to me.

2119
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:21,180
But however, if I reach 250 total, I'll bleach my hair live on stream.

2120
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:25,020
Um, I will go platinum, y'all platinum.

2121
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:28,140
But I just want people to hang out with me on my birthday.

2122
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:30,980
It's April 19th, starts at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

2123
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:35,060
And I just want people to hang out with me on my birthday.

2124
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:37,140
I can't go to Disneyland.

2125
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:38,540
Can't go to San Francisco yet.

2126
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:40,940
So hang out with me.

2127
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,860
I'm old. Send Geritol.

2128
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:47,940
If you want, I'll come bring you some prune juice.

2129
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:50,020
It is a warrior's drink.

2130
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:53,420
Well, you can just come over anyway.

2131
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:56,580
I won't be able to be there during the day when I'm working,

2132
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,220
but I'll pop in after work.

2133
01:58:58,220 --> 01:58:59,100
And if you're

2134
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:03,140
LFG, I'll hop in for at least a couple of games of Debbie.

2135
01:59:03,260 --> 01:59:06,820
So well, and the the sort of palate cleanser games

2136
01:59:06,820 --> 01:59:10,260
are going to be Marvel Midnight Sons and Cult of the Lamb.

2137
01:59:10,580 --> 01:59:15,460
And I think I may be able to attempt a Gartic Phone.

2138
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:18,500
If you haven't played Gartic Phone, it's kind of it's kind of.

2139
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:21,540
That's that's I've played a party game.

2140
01:59:21,540 --> 01:59:23,740
That is that. But it wasn't called that.

2141
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:26,580
I usually only ever played it on Nick's stream,

2142
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:29,060
but I might try hosting it myself. We'll see. It might be fun.

2143
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:31,740
All right. Well, thank you.

2144
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:32,900
Thank you, Dark Sakura.

2145
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:34,900
We'll see you next time. Have a great stream.

2146
01:59:35,860 --> 01:59:41,100
All right. See y'all on flip side and play pinball. Bye.

2147
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:43,540
I love pinball. I will.

2148
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:45,220
Loki, your final thought for tonight.

2149
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,380
Ever since you were a young boy, did you play the silver ball?

2150
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:51,140
From Soho down to Brighton.

2151
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:52,260
I don't know the next lyric,

2152
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:54,260
but I know exactly what you're referencing them all.

2153
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:56,460
Yeah, I must have played them all. That's all right.

2154
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:58,060
All right. Bye. Bye.

2155
01:59:58,060 --> 01:59:59,420
All right. Loki, your final thought tonight.

2156
01:59:59,420 --> 02:00:01,180
And don't break out in a song, please.

2157
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:03,140
I will never do that.

2158
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:06,780
So my final thought is hopefully we'll have some more content

2159
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:08,740
on the YouTube channel this week.

2160
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:10,980
I'm hoping to get one or two videos out this week.

2161
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:13,180
Awesome. Trying to step it up.

2162
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:17,620
My final thought, I will definitely be streaming more Final Fantasy

2163
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:18,980
or not Final Fantasy.

2164
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:20,420
Well, I'll probably play that again at some point, too,

2165
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:22,180
but definitely some more.

2166
02:00:22,700 --> 02:00:23,380
What's that game called?

2167
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:24,940
Pokemon Legends Arceus.

2168
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,860
Probably tomorrow going to continue on the main game

2169
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:29,220
because I did some stuff off stream and I have some new

2170
02:00:29,220 --> 02:00:30,620
Pokemons to show you.

2171
02:00:30,620 --> 02:00:33,020
So I'll be playing that tomorrow after work at some point as well.

2172
02:00:33,020 --> 02:00:34,780
I've got a lot of work to catch up on

2173
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:36,940
since I was out for two weeks unexpectedly,

2174
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:38,860
but we'll get there.

2175
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:40,980
So but that's it for me.

2176
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:43,780
Thank you all again for participating with our show tonight.

2177
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:45,180
I really appreciate you all being here.

2178
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:47,380
I hope you all have a fantastic week ahead.

2179
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:48,580
I hope you had a good Easter.

2180
02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:51,020
If that's your thing, Passover, if that's your thing

2181
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:52,580
or whatever is your thing.

2182
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:54,740
If just sleeping in on Sunday is your thing.

2183
02:00:54,740 --> 02:00:56,420
I hope I hope it was great.

2184
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:58,620
Quite frankly, we'll see you again.

2185
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:01,340
Don't forget your taxes unless you live in a place

2186
02:01:01,340 --> 02:01:03,020
where the deadline got extended.

2187
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:04,580
Don't don't forget that.

2188
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:07,380
And we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2189
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,620
Have a great week, everybody.

2190
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:09,740
Good night.
