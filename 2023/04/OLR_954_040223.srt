1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
Samba de Amigo Party Central is going to have Escape from the City and I am immensely

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,720
excited about this.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,680
The article doesn't specify which version it is, I'm holding out hope it might be

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,960
the Cash Cash or Blue Blur remix from Sonic Generations, but I expect it's going to

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,000
be the original version from Sonic Adventure 2.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,640
For a game that revolves around Samba thematically and dance generally, it's a toss up as to

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,720
which version would be considered best for the game.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,160
This is your Byla Byla update, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,920
and Loki to tell you the other detail from that article and the rest of the week's

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
gaming news.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,840
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,560
where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,640
We are live once again tonight, April the 2nd of 2023 with episode number 954 of our

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
show.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,240
I'm very thankful it is April the 2nd, that way you all know no April Fool's jokes

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,160
on tonight's show because that holiday is silly.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,880
I would like to see April Fool's Day become April Memes Day where you save your best meme

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,960
for the whole year and then unleash the memes on that day.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,040
That's what I think we should change.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,060
What do you think, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers, who's here every week?

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,060
Memes Day, who's in?

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,060
Cool.

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,040
I did nothing but memes for like five years all about Mass Effect.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
There you go.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,040
I can do this.

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,080
You've got a stock ready to go.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,800
And then that way people aren't believing fake news.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,920
I can't tell you how many things I saw posted on Facebook yesterday where it was like, did

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,040
you not check the calendar?

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,160
No RuPaul is not leaving Drag Race.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,040
I know, but to anybody out there listening who did.

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,840
I saw very little on Twitter, come to think of it.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Really?

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,680
I think that just a lot of the people I know are like, April Fool's Day is bullshit and

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,720
just don't participate anymore.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,040
I think there's kind of just like a whole generation out there that just is over April

40
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,800
Fool's Day, quite frankly.

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,080
You know what April 1st is?

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,360
The beginning of my birthday.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Your birthday month.

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,640
My birthday month, which I celebrate all month because me being alive is a gift to the universe.

45
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
We'll also say hello joining us every week.

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
Another gift to the universe.

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,200
Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Hello.

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Hi, Loki.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
How are you?

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm fine.

52
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,560
Are you a big April Fool's Day fan?

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm a fan of consuming April Fool's stuff.

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes.

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Okay.

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
All right.

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Fine.

58
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
How about April Memes Day?

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,680
I mean, yeah, that'd be cool.

60
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,440
Like a Meme Oscars or something like that.

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
The Meme Oscars.

62
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,840
I love it.

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
The best.

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
The best.

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, at

66
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,880
the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, where you can chat along with

67
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,880
our show.

68
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Or tonight, the listeners being very generous right now.

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,080
We're all the way up to a level six hype train.

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Loki, you had a lot to do with that.

71
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,440
You just gave out like 15 gift subs in chat, so thank you very much and thanks to everybody.

72
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,280
I will always ... Because we are taping a podcast here, I usually don't read out all

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,880
of those acknowledgements until the very end, but if you're here until the end, I will absolutely

74
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
shout all that out.

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,160
It also scrolls along the bottom of the screen, like a little CNN news ticker or something,

76
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,000
so please know we love all you guys that go the extra mile with your participation.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,120
Speaking of participating, hmm.

78
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,720
I just have to point out who's in chat today.

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,440
Well, I was actually going to read a comment from Shayla in chat who says, I have coffee

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,560
and it woke me up.

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,800
It has the extreme caffeine.

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,880
Well, that makes two of us, Shayla, because I'm drinking coffee here as we're getting

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,440
started here at the top of the show, as I tend to do, so.

84
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,360
Shayla is infamous.

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
From your stream, yeah.

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
From our team, Yeet, as the queen of chaos and the killer tamer.

87
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Yeah, she really cracked me up the way ... Because I lurk in your stream and I think I even played

88
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
games with Shayla.

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
I'm almost positive I did at one point.

90
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Yeah, I think you might have.

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,840
Just running up and trying to boop the killer and do all those things, just you know.

92
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,120
My impersonation of Shayla, I love you.

93
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
That's good.

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
That's good.

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
I love you.

96
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Boop.

97
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
I love you.

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Morimi.

99
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Come over.

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Morimi.

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Morimi.

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
All right.

103
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Anyway.

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Hence the reason I made that particular shirt.

105
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
The Morimi shirt is all about Shayla.

106
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,400
Andrew 200 Matt in chat says, would have thought Rob would have brought the tea for tonight's

107
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
E3 talk.

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Well, you know what?

109
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
It's all the same mug at the end of the day.

110
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Oh.

111
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,360
Oh, we have that topic to get into at the start of the show.

112
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Do we?

113
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,680
Well, what a lovely segue into our kickoff topic for tonight.

114
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,440
Look, all of you that listen to this show, I'm sure many of you follow what's going on

115
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,120
in the industry, so this news isn't going to come as a shock, but we're going to talk

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
about it.

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,600
I am completely shocked.

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
I may have a thing or two to say about this that might shock you.

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,080
So, Loki, what's the big headline on everyone's mind this week?

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,520
So first the news came out from IGN, from inside sources that said, hey, E3 is done

121
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,920
or E3 has been canceled this year, probably because everybody's leaving E3.

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,800
No one's actually, you know, displaying their games there.

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:25,760
Then prompted from that kind of reveal or scoop or whatever, the ESA or on the E3 accounts

124
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,600
basically said, hey, read pop and entertainment software association have announced that both

125
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,120
the digital and physical events for E3 2023 are canceled.

126
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,040
And then they did like an interview, I think, with I forget which site had a game industry

127
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:49,280
biz talking about the reasons they were blaming COVID-19 and a bad economy for some of the

128
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,520
reasons for the cancellation.

129
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,400
I mean, we knew that they would do that.

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,640
Did I not see the author of that article respond to you on Twitter going, it is not

131
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,080
COVID-19, it is not COVID-19.

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm almost positive I saw that reply on Twitter somewhere.

133
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,280
But regardless, that is certainly something they're pointing at as a reason amongst several

134
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,560
reasons with what's going on and certainly was a reason that they haven't done the show

135
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,400
for the past few years, including last year when most shows were coming back.

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,480
Whether it was a good idea or not with the pandemic going on, that's another discussion.

137
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,280
But most shows were coming back, E3 did not and said it was COVID-19, even though that

138
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,920
didn't seem to stop most of the other shows last year, but it is what it is.

139
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,000
And I do see some comments in chat, Shayla is asking, what is E3?

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Kind of less familiar.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,880
And to be fair, there hasn't been one since 2019.

142
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,800
So we're going on four years now, there hasn't been an E3.

143
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,600
So once upon a time, there was a trade show that was created for the gaming industry.

144
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,580
It was where work becomes fun.

145
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
That is E3.

146
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,720
And it was a chance for the game industry to get together and show off the games that

147
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,920
they're making to retailers.

148
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,820
Also because, you know, people from Montgomery Ward would come to the show and Kmart would

149
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,620
come out to E3, I said once upon a time, for what they're going to stock their shelves

150
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,620
with this year.

151
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,740
Bobby on his show tonight was showing an ad from 1998 that was talking about Pokemon and

152
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,500
how they were selling that to Toys R Us the first time, you know, this trade show was

153
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
going on.

154
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,180
And so it was a place for the industry to get together.

155
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,100
And then, you know, it might be, let's go out and have some drinks and have some gnarly

156
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,140
parties and, you know, just get together in the industry and do things and all that stuff.

157
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,460
Google at the booth babes, you know, they would always like, it was the misogynistic

158
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,160
like kind of take on the whole thing that they just had to plaster that around as well.

159
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,620
There was absolutely, especially in the early years, that mindset of the quote unquote boys

160
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,780
club that the video game industry was, and some would say still is, although there's

161
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,060
kind of treated it like a hot red show almost like it's like trying to get people to come

162
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
to their booth.

163
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,020
Now, I'm not going to razz E3 for that because they came a long way in the later years.

164
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,460
So forth, you know, they progressed with the rest of the industry that has nothing

165
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,060
to do with the reasons why they're no longer around as a show.

166
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,140
But what ended up happening as time went on, this thing out there got more and more popular

167
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,940
and it's called the internet and they would bring it into your house with cable, you know,

168
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,420
used to dial into it, but you know, that only let the internet move so fast.

169
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,860
But once they started bringing in the internet and cable lines, you could get video on demand.

170
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,740
You could watch video on demand, much like you're watching TV.

171
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,460
Actually, I think that's what y'all are doing right now with this very program.

172
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,700
I mean, you might be listening to it on the podcast feed, but that's a very similar sort

173
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,180
of thing, right?

174
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,860
And this is what started happening to E3 is that E3 just got televised at home and all

175
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,060
those trailers broadcast right into your home and everything there, there ended up being

176
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,980
less and less of a reason to actually go to E3 because more and more of it you could experience

177
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,840
from your couch.

178
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,600
Did my grandpa tell you a story about E3 2010?

179
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Maybe 2012?

180
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:21,800
It was one of those years I went and I had to justify at the Ubisoft booth why I deserved

181
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,200
a ticket to see their little show.

182
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,440
Like oh yes, I have a long running podcast.

183
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,160
Yes, we have XYZ number of listeners.

184
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Yeah, we do.

185
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,440
You know, and basically, you know, somebody's being very skeptical like, I don't know.

186
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Okay.

187
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,800
And then they let me in to a half empty theater and I get to see a trailer for the new Assassin's

188
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
Creed game, which granted looks really good.

189
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,560
And I saw a trailer for a bunch of other games.

190
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,920
I go back to the hotel that night and I see on YouTube the exact same trailer that I had

191
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,640
to justify why I should get into the theater to see.

192
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,200
That was the moment Rob Roberts started to realize this show really isn't what it used

193
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,400
to be and that the things that we experienced at the show and what's behind closed doors

194
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,480
and all that ain't what it used to be.

195
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,080
And Tiger class said, yep, once the internet became fast enough, it was like you were actually

196
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
there.

197
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Yeah.

198
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,520
And then you had television networks on cable that were broadcasting 24 seven sorta, but

199
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,900
for the most part all day long from that experience, et cetera, et cetera.

200
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:30,120
So the show started to basically lose its relevance as a news breaking sort of thing,

201
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,520
which is what E3 became known for over the years, even though E3 was supposed to be a

202
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,640
trade show for the industry to get together and wheel and deal.

203
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,440
But unfortunately at the same time, the internet was ruining this element of the conversation.

204
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,100
Do you remember back earlier when I was telling this story, I mentioned some of the retailers

205
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,440
that would go Montgomery Ward, Kmart, what happened to all these retailers?

206
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,300
They're also less of relevance that they used to be because of this little thing called

207
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,200
the internet and be it direct purchasing, direct to your house deliveries, all of those

208
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
types of things.

209
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,400
I'm not saying that places like GameStop, Target and places you can walk in and get

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,440
physical games don't exist anymore, but I think you all know it looks a lot different

211
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,620
in the year 2023 than it used to hell even in the year 2019 and certainly versus the

212
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,900
year 2006, which was the last like epic E3 type of year, basically.

213
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,180
Yeah, thank you, Bobby.

214
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,600
When we say theater, we mean like a theater built into a booth.

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,380
So it's like, yeah, four wall, it's a mini theater.

216
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,860
It's like Black Wolf Manor's basement theater.

217
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,860
It was like that.

218
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,860
Okay.

219
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,220
When you go to an electronic store and they have like, here's the demo set up for our

220
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,060
surround sound system theater type of thing.

221
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,500
And Shayla, don't apologize.

222
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,240
Of course you're learning, but you're also bringing up a very, very important point.

223
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,000
Unless you'd gone to E3, your brain was left to fill in a lot of the gaps on these sort

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,260
of things.

225
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,420
So when you were talking about going to the Square Enix theater to see the Final Fantasy

226
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,980
13 versus trailer, and you're reading about that in a magazine, a lot of people are reading

227
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,580
out thinking, Ooh, they have a whole theater there on the floor.

228
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,580
Wow.

229
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,500
This place must be big.

230
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,620
I was breaking into my Jennifer Coolidge there for a little minute.

231
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Wow.

232
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,100
Dish Avantage, big.

233
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
Just like my exes.

234
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Oh, forget it.

235
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Anyway.

236
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,780
One of the issues with E3 and those who can attend it can relate to says Tiger Claw is

237
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,940
the long longs just to try out a demo.

238
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
Yes.

239
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
Very that.

240
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Well, yeah.

241
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,580
And then, and then on top of that, like even when you go there, it seemed like, you know,

242
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,100
it was hard to keep track of like everything that you can't see everything in time.

243
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,780
And even if you knew like what you wanted to see and you could get through all the lines

244
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:53,560
and stuff, it's hard to keep track of like everything that's going on because you're

245
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,620
there in person.

246
00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:01,180
Whereas if you're on the Internet, you can just digest it on any number of gaming websites

247
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,380
that have all the headlines that they've been sent pre, you know, in advance by these game

248
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,380
companies.

249
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,380
Pretty much.

250
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,140
I mean, it's been that way.

251
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,140
Critch Peacefuzz in chat, HiHi says, I thought it was the studios that killed E3 who pulled

252
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,260
out, made their own event with hookers and cocaine.

253
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,740
I was just about to tell the Nintendo Direct starting this trend.

254
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,180
The Nintendo Direct was very much a beginning of the end and then Sony realized it could

255
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,300
work for them as well.

256
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,540
Now, I wouldn't necessarily attach hookers and cocaine to Nintendo.

257
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,360
But there's a certain part of the dark side of these trade show cultures that you all

258
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,320
have read about, unfortunately, that doesn't exist when you do the direct approach online

259
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,640
because people aren't gathering in a place and so forth.

260
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,280
So anyway, Loki, did you want to continue?

261
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,160
I know we've kind of got to, but I know maybe you want to talk a little bit about what's

262
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,440
next and that sort of thing.

263
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,080
So well, one of the things like, so they mentioned COVID-19, not necessarily COVID-19 as in the

264
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,600
disease itself is causing people not to attend or something like that.

265
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,320
It's more of that they're saying that COVID-19 altered the way studios develop games, I guess,

266
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,560
because now they're doing it remotely, you know, whereas they're maybe their release

267
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,840
schedules slowed a little bit because of that.

268
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,440
I mean, maybe like in the first year, but like, you know, this many years afterwards,

269
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
adapted.

270
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,020
I mean, I think Yeah, I think by now three years like if you haven't adapted yet to

271
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,140
being remote or working remotely, you're just not going to succeed as a business because

272
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
you have to adapt quickly.

273
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,740
You can't just take Oh, well, what's gonna take us like 10 years to adapt to this.

274
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,940
So I don't necessarily buy I think it's more of a situation where, sure, they're going

275
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
to blame all that.

276
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,740
So they're not going to say, well, it's because we're irrelevant.

277
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,220
I mean, they're not going to say that at all, obviously.

278
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,660
It's because these studios have figured out that, hey, one, we don't have to pay the you

279
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:12,820
know, this expensive cost to set up a booth at this event, and have to share the spotlight

280
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,940
with all these other studios, we could spend a fraction of that, set up our own event where

281
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,740
all eyes are on us, and just do whatever we want with it.

282
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,940
And I think that's just makes more sense.

283
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,780
It's less manpower for them to do all this, it's less cost for them to do it.

284
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,600
And it's more of a return out of it.

285
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,480
So of course, that's why the industry is going the way that they're going.

286
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,400
That said, though, like, it's also funny to see them compare, you know, compare this stuff

287
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,800
to, you know, COVID-19, and all its other tribute, all that, but then you have like,

288
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,760
you know, CES and stuff like that.

289
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,440
And I don't think that's ever like, gone down as far as

290
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,560
Tokyo game show and Gamescom are still going on a schedule exactly, even a couple rough

291
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
years.

292
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,080
So so like, I don't, I don't understand how those are successful.

293
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,600
It's basically the same type of thing.

294
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,620
Somebody said very plainly, why E3 died.

295
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,280
Somebody very plainly said it.

296
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,160
We'll come back to that in a minute, because I'm gonna I'm gonna point it out and underline

297
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,360
it when we get there.

298
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,320
Because it's it's very, very much the reason why it died.

299
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
But we'll get there in a minute.

300
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
Go ahead and tell us the rest of the news, Loki.

301
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Yeah.

302
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,760
So basically, you know, they, you know, said also that E3 is becoming less popular.

303
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,680
You know, while, you know, confirmed by ESA and E3 organized a repop before the report,

304
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,040
they said many have started the question if the annual trade show was actually going to

305
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,160
happen or not.

306
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,240
You know, just was it right before this announcement went out that they were canceling show Ubisoft

307
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,960
confirmed that they weren't attending.

308
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,760
Previous to that, of course, you had Sony saying they're skipping E3, Microsoft already

309
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,920
confirmed that they weren't going as well.

310
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,240
It's like, who's left?

311
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,200
I mean, like, there's not much left.

312
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,120
Nintendo is obviously not going.

313
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,680
So it's just, I think once again, it's going back to the they're becoming less relevant.

314
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,560
And they can't sustain it either with having, you know, the public come in because, yeah,

315
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,600
the public can come in.

316
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,680
But what are you gonna show them?

317
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:24,720
There's no one here like, I don't know, it was just I don't think it's sustainable anymore.

318
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:34,760
So somebody E3 tried to partner with in those last years before the pandemic hit, Jeff Keighley

319
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,360
has had some interesting chess moving pieces as a result of this.

320
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,480
Can we can we get to some of that for the whole like, what's gonna happen now in June

321
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
type of thing?

322
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,560
Yeah, let me see if I can find that here real quick.

323
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,840
I don't remember necessarily what Jeff Keighley is doing, but Summer Game Fest.

324
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,560
Well, I mean, yeah, I know that but like, I didn't know what, like recent additions

325
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
to that.

326
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Just that it's happening.

327
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,000
And there's, there's, he's very much been kind of hyping it up a bit tactfully around

328
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,960
the E3 cancellation news, which I want to come back to an earlier point, because here

329
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,520
it is because I left you all the cliffhanger hit it here.

330
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,000
But here's the person who told you why E3 was canceled, it's Jeff Keighley.

331
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,680
And it's it's it was a tweet that he very much kept in the drafts until this announcement

332
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,240
came out and then he hit send.

333
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,340
And here's the tweet.

334
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,320
Here's 15 year old me at the first ever E3 in 1995.

335
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
E3 meant so much to me and so many of you too.

336
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:41,040
Four years ago, I realized E3 wasn't evolving as it needed to compete in a global digital

337
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
world.

338
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
So we started building what's next.

339
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,880
E3 at Summer Game Fest, June 8th, and there it is somebody from the inside, because remember

340
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Jeff was working with E3 to try to fix some of these problems four years ago, stating

341
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:04,120
very plainly and accurately why E3 is done, E3 wasn't evolving as it needed to compete

342
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,160
in a global digital world.

343
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,400
That's why E3 is dead.

344
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,080
It did not evolve in many ways.

345
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,400
Honestly, and honestly, I don't even know why they bothered announcing that it was going

346
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
to be coming back to begin with knowing what they know.

347
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Safe phase.

348
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,480
Well, it's it's also it's it's the direction they're going looking worse.

349
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,240
How are they saving any face when they knew it would make them look worse?

350
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
It it's two different like purposes.

351
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
Each event had two different purposes.

352
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
Yeah, like a lot of it was game announcements and stuff, but E3 was supposed to be working

353
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,320
with retail and their distributor partners to, you know, have meetings about like, hey,

354
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
where are we going?

355
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
I mean, sure.

356
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,960
Getting the public excited about it as well.

357
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,840
That just goes back into sales stuff.

358
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,800
But when you're talking about a market that's consolidated a ton, you know, not only like

359
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,180
mom and pop video game shops, not a lot of them out there anymore.

360
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,600
The number of distributors that are out there that actually supply those places dwindling

361
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,200
down as we, you know, very few probably.

362
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,960
And then we're talking like retailers.

363
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,280
I mean, there's not a lot of retailers out there anymore.

364
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,680
Either you have, you know, your target, Wal-Mart, that type of stuff.

365
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
But like.

366
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,200
I mean, sure, they'll have meetings and stuff, but also, you know, for those not in the know,

367
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,480
outside of E3, they still have meetings like there's the whole PlayStation event that's

368
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,040
a destination PlayStation where they show the same type of stuff they have, like they're

369
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,280
almost like a mini E3 for all Sony stuff.

370
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,560
I'm sure Microsoft does something similar.

371
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,320
That's where those talks are happening now, not E3.

372
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,840
And so you never hear about destination PlayStation or like GameStop's internal like conferencing

373
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,040
that they have as well, because all that stuff's kept under lock and key.

374
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,360
As far as announcements and stuff go, it's all strategizing and everything.

375
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,720
So yeah, they're kind of irrelevant now.

376
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,880
So but the reason why Jeff Keighley is successful, because his intent and purpose isn't necessarily

377
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,960
to make deals with retailers, it's to promote the different games that these companies want

378
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,320
to promote and show.

379
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,480
So they come in, they're utilizing his platform to send the message out to a captive audience

380
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,120
about what's coming out to get people hyped up about that.

381
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:20,200
And then he is, of course, using that to drive this event for upcoming years.

382
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,440
So he can do all these fun things where they show off different stuff, because the focus

383
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,900
isn't on making these retail agreements.

384
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,360
It's about promoting these games.

385
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,320
It's a big commercial is basically it.

386
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Yep.

387
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,280
Jeff has asked that question that the ESA needed asked quite some time ago, and that

388
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,600
was what is special about this event that's going to make people want to come here and

389
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,440
not do their own thing digitally, instead of trying to apply the template that had worked

390
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
for years and years prior.

391
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,960
I want to get to a couple of comments here from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

392
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,640
She Hulk 10 says the game companies are cutting back, not investing in their people, customers

393
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,320
and so forth, stopping E3, canceling the company, picnics, breaks, PTO, safety meetings, catered

394
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,320
lunches, so forth, all money must be given to stockholders.

395
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,800
So E3 is just an expense the company's turned off accurate assessment.

396
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,620
Quite frankly, I would say to, to kind of take that a step further again, it goes back

397
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,840
to the ESA did not give a reason why you had to go to E3.

398
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,200
They did not create enough of a, of a must as to why to do that.

399
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,640
And again, we're looking at a lot of this.

400
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,120
I look very much at commentary on the ESA has nothing to do with read pop.

401
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,600
I'm sure read pop tried everything they could, but it was too far gone at that point.

402
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,100
They came in the picture too late, essentially the ESA has refused to evolve for the longest

403
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,100
time.

404
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,600
There are histories upon histories of examples of this going on.

405
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,920
This is even nitpicking on little things like remember how, how was, how was our weight

406
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:52,400
as an effective podcast gathered using Alexa rankings, which might've been a relevant internet

407
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,060
metric in the year 1999.

408
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,020
And that was something that they were continuing to use in 2010.

409
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,880
Now for those that think I'm being petty, how about, well, I can get real petty.

410
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,920
How about the fact that the ESA could not evolve their own security, which caused people's

411
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,780
personal information to be leaked time and time again with the show.

412
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,360
ESA did not evolve when they needed to evolve.

413
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,840
Therefore they are dead.

414
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,000
That is the simple, succinct short answer to this whole situation that Jeff very plainly

415
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,040
spelled out in that tweet, because again, Jeff is looking at this at a different angle.

416
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,420
And again, I'm really, I'm really not trying to suck up to this guy, but it's just one

417
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,400
of those things when it's right, it's right.

418
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,920
And he's doing a lot of things right.

419
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:40,820
As I said before on this show, before this was announced, the industry is giving Jeff

420
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,780
the credit that they won't give the ESA because Jeff is showing how he's bringing consumers

421
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,480
into this with what he's done with his video game award show and the other, you know, the

422
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,600
other things that he's done.

423
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,360
And he's going to get the industry to make announcements at summer game fest, the way

424
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,560
the ESA couldn't do.

425
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,960
And that's, that's just matter of fact.

426
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,420
And so Jeff is now saying, okay, what is this event I'm going to make?

427
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:10,460
And Jeff is looking at a consumer event and deciding not to go with the whole trade element

428
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,680
and all of that stuff.

429
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,980
We have GDC for that.

430
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,440
We have the other Tokyo game show and other places for this, and maybe something will

431
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,840
come along again soon, but it's not going to be E3.

432
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,000
And so now Jeff has this whole summer game fest thing that he's building.

433
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,280
And that's, that's what we're going to get now.

434
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,720
Although apparently the ESA did say, they said a really weird statement because they

435
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,080
wouldn't confirm the E3 is done, done, but they said something about, and I'm sorry if

436
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,800
I'm butchering the exact quote, but I don't have it in front of me, but something about

437
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,400
we look forward at bringing you E3 events in the future.

438
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,480
Like there would be branded E3 things, which is very clearly.

439
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,560
And I was just saying this, I'm so irritated that Bobby was on before us tonight and said

440
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,200
this exact, well I love Bobby, but I'm irritated.

441
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,920
He said this exact same thing is going to make it look like I stole it from him, but

442
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,960
I was ready to come in here and say, it's because they're going to, they're going to

443
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,240
inject E3 into PAX.

444
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,680
Reed Pop's going to take that E3 branding and they're going to inject it right into

445
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,240
PAX with the E3 show floor coming soon to Boston, coming soon to Seattle for the first

446
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,440
time E3, the show floor is now E3.

447
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,260
And quite honestly, I see it as a G4 tech TV type of situation.

448
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,920
Why the fuck are they PAX anymore?

449
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,560
I mean, not to be a bitch, but maybe a little bit.

450
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,440
Does anybody care about Penny Arcade, the comic anymore?

451
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,600
I don't think I have read the comic since we went to PAX.

452
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Sorry.

453
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,200
And I'm sorry to the people out there that are going to feel I'm being absolute jerk

454
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,520
with that comment, but the reality by and wide is it is not part of the pop culture

455
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,080
internet lexicon now the way that it was, as Dark Soccer was saying in 2008 when we

456
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
went.

457
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,480
Who remembers Mega Tokyo?

458
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Yeah.

459
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Yeah.

460
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:07,280
So I think next year E3 at PAX, 2025 E3, PAX turns into E3 and that's it.

461
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:12,440
And finally, the show you all thought was E3 is E3.

462
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,160
We had to go the long way to get there in the 15 year plan, but we finally got there.

463
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,880
It's funny because I made that comment when we went to PAX that one time I said, this

464
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,520
feels more like E3 than E3 did.

465
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
And yeah, it kind of is.

466
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Yeah.

467
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
And that's it.

468
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,840
But the thing I will give Penny Arcade Expo, and I do realize this, you have a lot of board

469
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:44,400
game fanatics, LAN fanatics, there are elements of PAX that E3 did not address, that PAX did

470
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,480
very well, just being a place to go play games and be a nerd, right?

471
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,760
There are those elements that PAX did well that E3 did not do well that I think that's

472
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,200
the part they're going to have to consolidate a little bit because I don't think they want

473
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,400
to take away those elements.

474
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,040
But isn't it going to be weird when there's board games at E3?

475
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,480
I don't know if they would do E3 at PAX because, okay, so, you know, I would assume that ESA

476
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,120
owns the E3 branding.

477
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,840
So why would you split off the revenue that you're making from PAX as read pop unless

478
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,680
ESA owns read pop to give money to the ESA?

479
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,920
I think it's the reverse.

480
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,360
Read pop wants the E3 name to bring in more people to PAX.

481
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,020
And that didn't seem to help them now.

482
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,560
So I don't know.

483
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,520
Fair point from Jason in chat, PAX isn't the Penny Arcade Expo, it's PAX.

484
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,160
That is a good point, you know, speaking of the, you know, the relevancy.

485
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,560
So what the hell is the name anymore?

486
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,980
It's an archaic name.

487
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,480
It's only tied to that con.

488
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,560
I think if they start calling the con E3, it's going to inject new life into it.

489
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,200
But who knows, who knows?

490
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,360
Bobby says, I remember talking to somebody who went to E3 in 2010 after attending PAX

491
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,960
in 08 and 09, and they were shocked E3 ended at 4 p.m.

492
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,120
They were like, where's the 24 hour LAN?

493
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,920
Exactly, exactly.

494
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,240
It's not a party.

495
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Yeah.

496
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,440
Stop being surprised, people.

497
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,360
But all of that has to do with why E3, you know, and I think you saw even the trade,

498
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,040
I think for years they've been retreating into game developers conference a little bit.

499
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,160
And even the parties, by the way, for game developers conference are all work centered.

500
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Yeah.

501
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,960
I mean, I went to a couple with Renee and it was a really great experience.

502
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,560
I liked that type of thing far better than what E3 had been even when we went.

503
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,440
There were some things I liked about E3, but there were a lot of things I didn't.

504
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,360
Yeah, meeting people was always the best part.

505
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
It really was.

506
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
So.

507
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
All right.

508
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,880
We're going to move on with the show because we could talk about this topic for a very

509
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,880
long time.

510
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,720
I feel like this is the third time we've eulogized E3.

511
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,280
I am fairly confident, and not to get an ego, but maybe a little bit, I've gotten a lot

512
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,960
of things right this year.

513
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,120
And this is one I'm going to add to the list.

514
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,280
This is the last time we're eulogizing E3.

515
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
It's done.

516
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,280
I'm done.

517
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,120
I honestly, I don't think that anyone is surprised.

518
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
It's not really news.

519
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
We expected it.

520
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
Yep.

521
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,760
I do not want to utter the words E3 ever again.

522
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,080
You're going to, I was going to say you're going to have to, but you don't have to do

523
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
anything.

524
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,120
But ReadPop is going to push that back into the conversation once they have the naming

525
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,640
rights over that.

526
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,720
But it won't be the same thing.

527
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
I won't even call it that because it's not E3.

528
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,800
I have to admit though, there was a morbidly curious part of me, like if they actually

529
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:00,800
did have an E3 this year, part of me kind of wanted to go in the whole, like, this is

530
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
so bad.

531
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,400
I have to see it for myself kind of way.

532
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,960
Like you wanted to go see the Ouya parking lot event.

533
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,460
I wanted to go, I want to see, what are the big fucking NFT ideas?

534
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,460
Let's see it.

535
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,200
Let's just see all this shit for what it is.

536
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,960
Let's just...

537
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,240
He's like, it's our year to shine now.

538
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,520
I still, I still, I can't.

539
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,920
SSJ 100 Matt in our chat says, Jason Schreier, famous Twitter personality, I believe Bloomberg

540
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,920
is his outlet, says, was saying that the talk at GDC was everyone asking, you going to E3?

541
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,920
Meh.

542
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Are you going?

543
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Is it happening?

544
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Meh.

545
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:53,160
As I said, there was, we were like two months out from June at this point, two months out

546
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,520
from June.

547
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,760
And we said like the sweet spot to get flights had passed and we didn't even know if there

548
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,720
was going to be an E3.

549
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,080
It was, it was already far gone.

550
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
We knew this was coming.

551
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,560
It was just a matter of when.

552
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:12,880
I actually thought it would be, I did not call the timeframe of the cancellation correctly.

553
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
I apologize to the internet for getting that one wrong.

554
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,640
I thought it would be next week, but maybe because the leaks or whatever, they bumped

555
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,200
it up.

556
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,360
Anyway, let's move on.

557
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,520
Let's talk about, let's talk about facts.

558
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,160
The games that we've been playing in our gaming weeks, the types of video games that have

559
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,280
brought joy for the most part into our weeks this week.

560
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,480
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

561
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,200
My gaming week was, it was all right.

562
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,960
I played, I actually had a really, really good game of Beatlemania and we are trying

563
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,820
to work things out to where it will be ours.

564
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,360
So that was at my house for a lot longer.

565
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
I freaking love that table.

566
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,160
You know, it's just so much fun.

567
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,320
It's not my favorite.

568
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,680
That's World Cup Soccer and then Theater of Magic, but it's really fun.

569
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,520
I love it.

570
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,120
And then I've played of course, Marvel Midnight Suns.

571
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,380
I played on stream last night.

572
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:14,320
I have the controller that will apparently work for Star Ocean, but I was lazy and honestly

573
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,840
Midnight Suns fit my mood a lot better.

574
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,700
I wanted to finish the Morbius DLC and it was really good.

575
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,980
I am, I'm, they did a great job.

576
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:29,640
I just wish that some of these missions and DLCs came with more, you know.

577
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,060
Of course I played Dead by Daylight.

578
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,060
Oh yeah.

579
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,580
And Strelok was in last night and I got to experience the game in a completely different

580
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,140
way by giving descriptions of the scenery.

581
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:46,340
And I was pleased to do so, but I noticed so much more dopping and taking in the scenery

582
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,740
and then providing as accurate of a description of it as possible.

583
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,100
Really good exercise for me also in my endeavors as a writer.

584
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Just real quick.

585
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Sorry.

586
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Loki, you have background noise coming through.

587
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Just so you know.

588
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
Sorry.

589
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
Sorry.

590
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Families in here.

591
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
No, all good.

592
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
Just mute.

593
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
Text messages.

594
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:12,140
At any rate, I did play Dead by Daylight.

595
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm stuck at Eerie 3.

596
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:19,740
People are being ridiculous, but I've kind of gotten this attitude, and I must admit

597
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,860
I was really tired playing on Monday because it kind of affected my mood.

598
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:30,860
But overall I'm trying to adopt a more of a, you know what, it's a game.

599
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,260
These people, I don't know them.

600
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,860
I will reach out to them if I think that they were cool and say they did well.

601
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:47,180
But in the end, I'm fine with just going, not caring if I talk to the assholes or not.

602
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,060
I'll just report them and move on.

603
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,560
They're not worth it, you know?

604
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:01,660
And trying to offer some encouragement to people who are like, just crap the whole game.

605
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
They're targeting me.

606
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,060
No one's targeting you.

607
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,020
For the record, they don't know who the fuck you are.

608
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,420
Unless they actually follow you or something, and then they know who the fuck you are.

609
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,540
I also started putting TTV in my name, which I don't know how I feel about it right now,

610
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,900
but I made friends, so maybe it's good?

611
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Question mark?

612
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:26,380
Anyway, I also have been playing my word game because I am addicted to it, and I started

613
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,860
playing Marvel Snap just out of boredom.

614
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
It's alright.

615
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
It's not great.

616
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:38,580
It's not the major, super fun thing that people have told me is it's just a fucking card game.

617
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:46,140
But it's entertaining, and yeah, it's entertaining.

618
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,900
And then it's not playing the game, but I listen.

619
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:56,360
I had the Hataful Boyfriend soundtrack on earlier today when I was just working on some

620
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,380
stuff at my desk.

621
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,860
It's immersing yourself in the game.

622
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:06,420
Well, the funny thing is I actually wasn't even playing it, not all the music is original.

623
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,860
And then I've also been prepping some stuff for my event on my birthday.

624
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Nice.

625
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,860
Alright.

626
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Yep.

627
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,500
I'm gonna be older.

628
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,980
That's how birthdays work.

629
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,980
Every day.

630
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,380
Unless you're Bobby Blackwolf, he's 29 every year somehow.

631
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,100
On your birthday, you are not a year older.

632
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,100
You're a minute older.

633
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,580
Yeah, it's how 40 isn't that much different from 39, to be honest.

634
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,040
You're older every day.

635
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,380
Right now, you are older than you have ever been.

636
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,220
You're older than you were when the show started.

637
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,920
Go get that Geritol, grandpas.

638
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
You're ready for it.

639
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,140
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

640
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,940
It's all Minecraft.

641
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,500
I start off finishing up my newest episode, so I put that out on my YouTube channel.

642
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,260
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

643
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
Yeah.

644
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:09,900
And then also went ahead and I've been playing actually recently.

645
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,600
So, you know, April Fools obviously was a thing.

646
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,320
So Minecraft put out their April Fools update, which is the vote update.

647
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,180
And so like you have with the normal game, they do these events where you vote on different

648
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,900
features that they add to the game.

649
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,780
Well, now you're voting on features in the game constantly.

650
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,100
And so the rules are changing constantly as you vote for things and it gets weird and

651
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
wacky.

652
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,420
There's 380 different modifiers in the game.

653
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:47,380
Like everything from like big head mode to to things that they should have added in the

654
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,380
game.

655
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,500
And they said they couldn't add in the game, but then they did add in the game in this

656
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
update.

657
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,620
And now they're probably not going to put in the proper game, which is like why you've

658
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,900
developed it.

659
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
You can do it.

660
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,020
You're just now being stubborn and not doing it.

661
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
So there's that.

662
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:09,240
So I spun up a server last night for the updates and I'm trying to get some people to play

663
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,500
with me to do like a one month long kind of like miniseries thing where we all the chaos

664
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
in there.

665
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,300
And it's pretty crazy right now.

666
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,660
So I'm looking forward to that.

667
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,740
And then working on my new modded episode.

668
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,740
So that's coming as well.

669
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,940
And still no word from Mo Yang about the contest.

670
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,540
They are everybody keeps asking him about it and is taking them an unreasonable long

671
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,860
amount of time to announce someone to evaluate.

672
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:45,380
They have they have started and ended new contests in the time that they still haven't

673
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,240
put out the results for that.

674
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,420
So your guess is as good as mine at this point.

675
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,260
We'll just have to wait and see.

676
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,140
But right now, I have no idea.

677
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,300
Oh, but I did want to mention a completely separate topic from games when saw Dungeons

678
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,300
and Dragons today.

679
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,300
It's fantastic.

680
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
Go see it.

681
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Is it?

682
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,300
I've heard good things.

683
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
Yeah.

684
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
The scene.

685
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Which scene?

686
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,100
The the the Easter egg.

687
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Yes.

688
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,100
I saw the Easter egg.

689
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:19,180
It is a prominent a prominent part of the movie in at least it's in several parts.

690
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,660
But yeah, there's lots of Easter eggs.

691
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,980
I'm not really familiar with the Dungeons and Dragons lore, but obviously there's a

692
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,180
lot of like name drops for different things like they know in the view game space like

693
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,460
Baldur's Gate.

694
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,340
Was it a universe is it set in or is it like multi universe?

695
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,660
I don't know.

696
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,660
It.

697
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Yeah.

698
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,260
It's something to do with the Red Wizards, but I guess that's all canon and stuff.

699
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,420
But yeah, it's really cool.

700
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,420
Really.

701
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,220
And there's a lot of funny moments in there.

702
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,140
It sounds it is a great movie.

703
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,740
I highly recommend you go see it.

704
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,980
You know, and I was reminded I totally forgot that this was this week.

705
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,740
The Mario movies out this week.

706
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,740
There's a lot of people.

707
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,740
I'm also seeing that this week.

708
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,740
Yeah.

709
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,740
We're going to be seeing that opening day.

710
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,740
So very excited.

711
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
I'm not.

712
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,500
I have two other movies that I want to see and then I'll decide if I want to see the

713
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,620
Mario movie when nobody else is seeing it.

714
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,180
Yeah, I don't have to deal with other humans.

715
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,300
Yeah, I don't want to deal with kids in the theater, but I might go to a late showing.

716
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,420
I just had to find a date.

717
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,140
Maybe Alan will take me, but I don't know.

718
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:24,100
This is the person who went to see the Pokemon movie with me back in the day.

719
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,700
That was a long time ago, but yes.

720
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,900
You want to know what movie I saw in the theater when it came out?

721
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,780
The Power Rangers movie.

722
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
Oh, yeah.

723
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,580
I got dragged to that too by you know who to the Power Rangers.

724
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,660
But I say drag, but it actually was a decent movie.

725
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,260
I thought when I was in Alabama, I was in college and I went with my friend Marcy to

726
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,260
see it.

727
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,380
I'm talking about the original.

728
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,260
I was talking about the Elizabeth Banks one.

729
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,260
Okay.

730
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,260
Yeah.

731
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,980
I mean, the real thing.

732
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,980
Got it.

733
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
All right.

734
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,700
Um, let's start with the skydiving and all that.

735
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,700
Yeah.

736
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,020
Let's talk about my gaming week.

737
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,580
So my gaming week, I have continued to play theater them.

738
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,460
I streamed a little bit of that earlier in the week because there was some new DLC for

739
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,860
Nier that came out this week.

740
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:11,820
So played through that been still I'm still working on trying to play every song once

741
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,940
I'm still not there.

742
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,340
I'm really close, but not there yet.

743
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,260
Actually I say really close, like 70 songs to go, but I'm going to play some more off

744
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:22,340
stream probably tonight and maybe the next time I stream that game, when the next DLC

745
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:27,020
comes out next week, I'll be, I'll be ready to finally get that trophy for playing every

746
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,260
song at least once.

747
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,580
And just knowing that I've played every song at least once been experimenting with some

748
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,700
different builds, like to item farm and do things like that.

749
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,140
So that's been, that's been fun.

750
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,860
Otherwise most of my gaming week, large chunk of it has been playing a little bit of an

751
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860
oldie at this point.

752
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,220
It's a little bit of backlog catch up, but not that old, it's maybe about a year old.

753
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,620
Pokemon Legends Arceus.

754
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,820
I've been streaming hours and hours of that and been playing a little bit off stream as

755
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,820
well.

756
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:57,740
I've now surpassed the point I was at the first time, but I'm having a lot of fun with

757
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,740
it.

758
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,900
Just, you know, the whole stealthy, my, my mindset approach to it is very different as

759
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,220
opposed to feeling the need to complete the Pokedex.

760
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,180
Like as I go, I'm just kind of catching everything, crafting everything and just kind of taking

761
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,820
it as I want to do things and kind of taking that attitude with it.

762
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,020
And I feel like I'm making a lot better progress.

763
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,100
I'm actually, and apparently I just got to the third area, the coast lands.

764
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,260
The minimum you need to get to that area is three stars.

765
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,580
I was reading, I have four stars.

766
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:33,140
So even the approach I'm taking is still allowing me to be ahead of the curve, so to speak on

767
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,140
the game.

768
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,140
But I'm, I'm having fun.

769
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,660
I it's, it's a different approach to Pokemon, you know, doing like the stealth catching

770
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,500
and all that stuff, but I'm having a good time.

771
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,580
I got a shiny in the game randomly this week.

772
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:50,220
There's actually a clip from my channel, a yellow Shinx showed up randomly out of the

773
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
blue.

774
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,260
So I actually had a little bit of shiny luck.

775
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,180
Everybody who plays gets a shiny Ponyta because it's in one of the quests, but I actually

776
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,300
got a shiny Shinx as well.

777
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,680
So that was pretty exciting, even if I've seen those before, but that's all right.

778
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
I like Shinx because it's very different.

779
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,360
It's not just like it's blue, but darker.

780
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,660
It's a very obviously different color and I think that's fun.

781
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,680
So yeah, I'm loving Pokemon Legends Arceus.

782
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,840
Other than those two games, I've also been playing still a lot of Diablo three, whether

783
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,460
it's just, I've been playing the latest season.

784
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,780
I just got my gold portrait frame tonight.

785
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,340
It took me a little time cause I had to farm another six piece set for those that play

786
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,340
the game.

787
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,840
You know, you have to get these various landmarks and the, I'm playing a witch doctor this season

788
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,780
and the free set that they give you is the new set they put in the game later on.

789
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,980
So there is no set dungeon for it.

790
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:46,780
So you can't clear the set dungeon achievement unless you farm a new set.

791
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,660
It sounds really tedious and boring, but that's exactly what Diablo is supposed to be.

792
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,700
Click party, do the loop again.

793
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,860
You didn't get the loop you wanted again.

794
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,740
You didn't get the loop you wanted again.

795
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,740
That's Diablo.

796
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,040
But I watch, I lurk in people's Twitch channels, like I'll watch Dark Soccer, play Midnight

797
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,780
Suns for a little bit and then do it, do a rift and then like, okay, if somebody else

798
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,340
on Twitch, I want to watch for a little bit, I'll channel surf and do a rift here and lurk

799
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,340
and do that.

800
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:17,120
That's, that's my Diablo playing in a nutshell.

801
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,320
So that was my gaming week.

802
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,160
I imagine I'll still be playing a lot of Legends Arceus this week.

803
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,240
I do want to beat it.

804
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,760
So I'm going to try to do most of my play on stream, but I've been doing some things

805
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,760
off stream, like side quests and like grinding arts and crafts and things like that.

806
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,020
Things that I, I, you know, don't necessarily need to stream.

807
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,140
So all right, let's move on.

808
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,920
We have some more news to get into for this week.

809
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,040
And then we'll take your calls later on in the show over on our discord server, vognetwork.com.

810
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,960
That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

811
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,840
For now, let's get to our first big story tonight from Loki.

812
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,480
Yeah.

813
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:07,120
So you know, Congress is really trying to get to the bottom of important topics right

814
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,680
now.

815
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
Not gun violence.

816
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,240
Now's not the time for that.

817
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,440
But now we're going to talk about how Japan is being unfair.

818
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,640
And it's just not fair that Japan and Sony you know, have like such a large market share

819
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,400
of the Japanese audience.

820
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,420
And it's just not fair to Microsoft.

821
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:34,420
So they have interjected themselves into this whole acquisition of Activision from Microsoft

822
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:43,980
by I think, sending a letter to Sony and I guess, I'm sorry to the US trade or they said

823
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:51,000
this letter to Sony in regards to the attention of the imbalanced in the video game market

824
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,860
and says which we are concerned may be a result of discriminatory trade practices that could

825
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:02,780
violate the spirit of the US Japan digital trade agreement that Sony has a 90% console

826
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:08,460
market share in Japan, and that makes exclusive arrangements to keep popular games from the

827
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,920
Xbox.

828
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,380
So kind of like a reverse Activision, I guess if you will.

829
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,700
I wish they would just focus themselves on more important things.

830
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,260
I mean, considering that they have literally no idea on how the internet works right now,

831
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,980
Grandpa, I'm sorry, just doesn't understand.

832
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,420
And I really wish that they would turn their sights to something more important than Microsoft

833
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,420
not being as popular as Sony in Japan.

834
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,940
I mean, it's not even the United States, like, who cares?

835
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,940
I don't know.

836
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,100
But they even start about how much revenue that or how much money the Japanese government

837
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:48,260
puts into Sony as a major, you know, part of the economy.

838
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:53,740
Well, I think the whole ordeal just goes to show that the US is not going to stop that

839
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,460
Microsoft Activision merger, basically, a Congress person who I believe gets a lot of

840
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,580
donations from Microsoft for the record, has basically gone on record saying, you know,

841
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:10,380
I feel as an indirect response to what's going on in the UK, basically saying, why is Sony

842
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,540
arguing all this shit when they've got all this going on in Japan?

843
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,800
That's how it read to me.

844
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,420
I don't think a Congress person needed to involve themselves in that.

845
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,780
That's the part that strikes me as kind of odd.

846
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,300
And it definitely just shows that, you know what, US ain't going to put up a fight on

847
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,300
this merger.

848
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,260
So the fact that it's cleared the UK, I would say at this point was the biggest hurdle.

849
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,120
I realize Congress is not the body that does this, but it's still showing a temperature

850
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,980
check of what Washington DC is thinking.

851
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:44,120
I don't see how this doesn't pass muster at this point in the US and this merger goes

852
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,620
through because if it doesn't, then Congress is going to be like WTF.

853
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:54,580
I mean, they're busy right now trying to ban TikTok anyways, so it's like, I don't

854
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,220
get me started on that either.

855
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,780
No, it's the whole thing is stupid.

856
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,420
Once again, you hear the line of questioning and like anything that when we talk about

857
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,220
like Facebook and the security leads with that and everything, and this, their lack

858
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,700
of understanding of how social media works and how the internet works or anything works,

859
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,700
really.

860
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:18,980
It's just like these people are making decisions based off of being stupid and then someone

861
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,620
tells them, well, this is how it works without knowing anything or just listening to them

862
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,620
blindly.

863
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,540
And it's like, okay, then they make sweeping decisions based on like these false narratives

864
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,180
and stuff that because they're just not informed because they're super old.

865
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,180
They're old.

866
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,820
The computer, the internet didn't exist when they were like our age.

867
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,140
They are super old and they need to leave.

868
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,580
But unfortunately they have to make decisions now about that stuff.

869
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Oh God.

870
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:51,540
And when AI comes around, well, straight up on Star Trek, is this like, you know, like,

871
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,540
I don't know.

872
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,540
I can't think.

873
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,540
Is this like Tron?

874
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,540
Is this Tron?

875
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,540
Are we running into a Tron situation?

876
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,540
No, no, no.

877
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,420
For the generation in Congress.

878
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,620
Is this like 2001 A Space Odyssey?

879
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,940
That's 2001 A Space Odyssey, yeah.

880
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,340
Like here's, it's, yeah, it's awful.

881
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,660
Here's, here's, here's the thing.

882
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,900
I trust TikTok with my data more than I do Twitter at this point.

883
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,560
Now here, here I go.

884
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,700
Here come my soapbox.

885
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,700
Here it is.

886
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:23,100
But I'm just going to say the person in charge of Twitter that has no right to be there,

887
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:30,460
but had the bank account big enough to do it has shown a willingness to post in private

888
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:39,300
employee conversations to advance whatever his stupid agenda is over on that site.

889
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,080
At least I don't see the CEO of TikTok doing that.

890
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:48,540
So I, the whole thing is, the argument is invalid as far as I'm concerned when Twitter

891
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,340
is not being dragged through the mud, just to the same extent that TikTok is.

892
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,540
Well, that was the point, like when they met in Cong-, or had like the thing in Congress,

893
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:02,460
like that was the first point they brought up was like, you first off, like, you know,

894
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,180
they're saying the Chinese government doesn't have access to this stuff anyways.

895
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:08,540
They were like, but that aside, like, what about Facebook?

896
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,900
What about like Twitter?

897
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,540
Like what about all these companies that have the same issues and like Facebook has been

898
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,580
caught several times selling that information?

899
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:19,660
Like it's not just like, we assume that this is happening.

900
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,540
It's like, it's demonstrably happening.

901
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:28,320
I mean, they've been caught numerous times, like, like, why, why are you holding TikTok

902
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,180
to a different regard than everything else?

903
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,420
It's because you think it's a Chinese spy app, which I mean, yeah, they may have access

904
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,420
to it.

905
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,020
But like, what are they really going to do with like, oh, yeah.

906
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,860
It's information they could get other ways.

907
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,900
Like, yeah, I don't know.

908
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:42,900
It's just so stupid.

909
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,300
But like, I don't understand what the point is.

910
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,980
Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says, from an IT point of view, TikTok should not be on government

911
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,060
and corporate phones.

912
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,060
And that's it.

913
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,060
I agree.

914
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,280
I actually agree with that.

915
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,020
And Facebook shouldn't be there either.

916
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,220
And neither should Twitter.

917
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:01,500
None of them should be on government or corporate phones.

918
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
That I will agree with.

919
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Yeah.

920
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Yeah.

921
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:09,300
I mean, but there's way too many companies out there, including the one where I work,

922
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:17,500
where they provide, I guess, links to corporate services through your personal phone.

923
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,620
And they can't tell people what to put on their personal phone.

924
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,620
Yeah.

925
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:27,960
So that's kind of a fine line if, if they don't want this to be on a phone that somebody

926
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,420
who is working in this facility is using, they need to give them their own business

927
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,420
phone.

928
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,420
Period.

929
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,900
That has data, right.

930
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:42,280
That has, uh, uh, management, uh, a management profile on it that would prevent from installing

931
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:48,220
social media applications, but companies aren't going to give everybody their own phone.

932
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,700
The government's not going to give everybody their own phone.

933
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,700
That's yeah.

934
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,700
Yeah.

935
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,380
And that's what they, they have like, at least I know for our company, they have something

936
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:02,760
similar, like if you're using your phone for work, um, which I like, I used to check stuff

937
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,560
through work, but like now that they've locked it down, like, no, I'm not going to go through

938
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,320
the whole process, but it's basically, you would have to set up a separate login, which

939
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,680
basically then locks everything down.

940
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,920
So it's like, there's a separation between your work data and your, you know, public

941
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,520
data, I guess there's like a wall there.

942
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,520
And when you're in your work data and all that stuff, then it's locking all of that

943
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,520
stuff down.

944
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,920
They're monitoring what you're doing, that type of stuff like that.

945
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,200
But it, you'd have to be in on that secure login in order to do that.

946
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,840
And I'm just like, that's too much trouble.

947
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,300
Plus I don't want people contacting me when I'm not working.

948
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,840
So I'm not doing that.

949
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
Yeah.

950
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,840
I don't use my work phone for anything but texts and emails.

951
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,720
The, I would say the most personal thing I've ever used my work for work phone for the occasional,

952
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,720
and I mean, occasional Apple news headline that pops up on my phone, cause it's an iPhone

953
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,320
that grabs my attention.

954
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,320
That's it.

955
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
No.

956
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,320
Um, I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll be perfectly honest.

957
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:04,880
Um, I don't let any, I will not put anything work-related on anything personal that I don't

958
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,880
blame you.

959
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,880
I don't blame you.

960
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:13,680
I must have that defining line or else like people who do do this stuff all the time.

961
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,160
No, that's unhealthy.

962
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,520
When you're at home, be at home.

963
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,520
Shit.

964
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,520
Um, real quick.

965
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,520
Uh, one more comment on this.

966
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
I want to get to the next story.

967
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,160
DJ Romas says the difference is that TikTok is originally a Chinese company and that's

968
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,160
the issue they're having.

969
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Oh, absolutely.

970
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,200
But guess what?

971
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,440
And this is true of every, any Congress person as well.

972
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,600
All the phones in your pocket were made in China.

973
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,600
All of them.

974
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,600
It doesn't matter what brand.

975
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,960
I don't care if you're an iPhone.

976
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,260
They have some component at least that was made in China.

977
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:44,960
The device you're using to listen to this podcast, watch this show had a, it's part

978
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,720
of it was made in China, some part of it.

979
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:53,180
So this whole TikTok thing just screams out of touch, but anyway, but as far as government

980
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,180
phones go, fine.

981
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,180
Yes.

982
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,180
All social media should be banned on government phones.

983
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,180
Yes.

984
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,180
I would agree with that.

985
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:03,020
Anyway, moving on, let's talk about other unpopular changes that have nothing to do

986
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,100
with the government, but I, some people are wondering if this one ends up with the government

987
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,860
and let me tell you, that would be, I don't think it does.

988
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,220
That would be the day though.

989
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,900
Um, Pokemon go.

990
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,900
Yes.

991
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,900
It's still going.

992
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:20,020
Um, I know in 2016 that was, that was the year, the year before the simulation started

993
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,600
the summer of 2016 boy, those were the days.

994
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,440
Those days are long gone, but Pokemon go has still been going.

995
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:32,640
In fact, Pokemon go made several changes to the game in response to COVID lockdowns.

996
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,880
And now Niantic wants to undo some of those changes.

997
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,700
It's not popular with the community.

998
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,000
Go figure.

999
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,760
So this week that they announced that a remote raid passes and remote raids would be changing.

1000
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,360
The price of the remote raid pass three pack would be increasing from 300.

1001
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:59,840
That's about $3 to 525 pokey coins, about 500 or $525, $5 and 25 cents.

1002
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:08,080
The price of a single remote raid pass will jump from 100 to 195, almost $2.

1003
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,740
Trainers will be able to participate in a maximum of five remote raids per day.

1004
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:17,080
And this maximum may change and increase for special events.

1005
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,660
They are saying though, remote raid passes will be included in the pool of potential

1006
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,620
rewards for research breakthroughs.

1007
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,620
That's kind of nice.

1008
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,620
Cause I don't buy those things anymore.

1009
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,220
I'm going to come back to that in a minute.

1010
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,760
But they are still subject to the limit of, you can only have three of them in inventory

1011
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,760
at a time.

1012
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,420
Anyway, long story short, people are pissed about this news.

1013
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:44,580
So far as you know, I don't want to play the game outside due to a limitation I may have

1014
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,580
or whatever it is.

1015
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,860
I got used to these changes.

1016
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,500
I'm pissed off about these changes.

1017
00:54:50,500 --> 00:55:00,680
From where I'm sitting, Niantic made a classic, classic blunder that blows my mind that they

1018
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:06,740
are aloof enough to still do, because they've gone through this before.

1019
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,580
Remember when they changed the range of a pokey stop from 80 meters back down to 40

1020
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,580
meters?

1021
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,620
And they ended up having to reverse course on that by the way, because the community

1022
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,660
got pissed.

1023
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:23,340
The same thing then that's happening now, you announced the bad news without announcing

1024
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,540
any good news to go with it.

1025
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:32,200
And I'm sorry, maybe you'll get a remote raid pass and your research pack is not good news.

1026
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,540
And they linked in that announcement article to an article that talks about, we have exciting

1027
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,620
changes coming for the game and we're going to have all these events that will get excited

1028
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,180
to get people back in person.

1029
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:51,660
What a bunch of fucking bullshit fluff, hot air up my butthole statement was that?

1030
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,660
Literally nothing tangible.

1031
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:54,660
Nothing.

1032
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,820
Tell us how you really feel.

1033
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:58,820
How I really feel?

1034
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:05,620
I have never seen in my life, I have been covering video games for 21 years.

1035
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:13,860
I have never seen such a load of hot air up our fucking asshole than Niantic putting

1036
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:20,380
out that statement of, here's the good stuff that's going to offset the bad stuff.

1037
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,340
What the fuck was that?

1038
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,420
Do you not have a PR department?

1039
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,820
I know Twitter doesn't have a PR department, but last I checked Niantic is not auto responding

1040
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,580
to things with the poop emoji.

1041
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:36,340
There are people actually thinking at Niantic, but when they put this release out, I don't

1042
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,300
think anybody was thinking.

1043
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,220
Did they have the week off?

1044
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:44,780
What the fuck were you thinking?

1045
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,980
I'm assuming emergency meetings were happening this weekend after the large way that this

1046
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:55,940
went over in the community, like diarrhea at a library where the ventilation is broken.

1047
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:00,060
That's about how well this news went over when they announced this, because there was

1048
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,420
no good news to offset the bad news.

1049
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:12,860
I just don't know why they need consultants to consult people who actually have a pulse.

1050
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,260
There is a sick part of me that loves Niantic.

1051
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,980
I still do.

1052
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:22,660
And again, not to use the example I've been using for 20 years, but here I go, Tyra Banks,

1053
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,660
we were rooting for you.

1054
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,080
We were all rooting for you.

1055
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,120
There is very much that coming into play with what I'm saying about Niantic right now, because

1056
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,680
I've loved Niantic from before Pokemon Go, because I'm an old school Ingress player.

1057
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,560
Yes, I'm one of those irritating people in the Pokemon Go community.

1058
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:41,880
I was playing Ingress, Pokemon Go, hell, I really try to give all of the AR games a break,

1059
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,480
but I'm going to be real honest.

1060
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,040
Niantic, this decision and a lot of other things going on at Niantic feel really drunk

1061
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:58,640
with power, and this is not a good look, because let me tell you, NBA All World sucks.

1062
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,360
NBA All World sucks.

1063
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:07,640
I don't know who the fuck thought it would be a very enticing game to go out into the

1064
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:13,480
world to play a shoddy 1v1 game when standing at a basketball court.

1065
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,460
I don't know who the fuck thought that was a good idea, but they were very wrong.

1066
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:26,580
And if that's what the future of Niantic games looks like, they're in some deep fucking trouble.

1067
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:32,460
And Niantic is going to get bought by another company if they continue to make stupid decisions

1068
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,300
like this one.

1069
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:45,900
Learn something from this, because I honestly feel like Niantic never does.

1070
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:50,880
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I honestly think Niantic was okay with rural and disabled people

1071
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,800
not playing their game, as the people who are walking around and playing the game as

1072
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,760
originally intended are the ones that give a data set of value.

1073
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:11,120
I believe Niantic believes that if a disabled person can't play the game, that is not a

1074
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:15,760
fault of Niantic, but a fault of the world for not being accessible.

1075
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,040
I will say this, and I am willing to go on record saying this.

1076
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:30,040
I would be very curious how many non differently-abled people out there are latching on to the disabled

1077
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,120
conversation just to dunk on Niantic.

1078
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:38,560
Because again, from my Ingress experience, one of the most hardcore players in this area

1079
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:43,040
that is very good at Ingress where you have to go to different locations and throws very

1080
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,840
good field, she uses a scooter 95% of the time.

1081
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,200
That doesn't stop her from being a beast in Ingress.

1082
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,680
Rob, I still don't think that that's going to be a very good example.

1083
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,360
There are people who cannot afford a mobility scooter.

1084
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:05,120
There are people who are on- I did not say I'm not aware of any of that.

1085
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:10,480
I'm just saying, I think there's a lot of people who are latching on to this argument

1086
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,160
for the wrong reasons.

1087
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,760
I think it's about, I don't want to pay $2 as opposed to $1.

1088
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:27,280
Anyway, let's see, VXJ6V in chat says, getting bought by another company isn't a punishment.

1089
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,340
Not to some, but I just see that's the road Niantic's headed down.

1090
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,840
Because NBA All-World, as far as I'm concerned, is a flop.

1091
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,600
I'm not hearing about anybody playing it.

1092
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,380
It's not in the press.

1093
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,680
It's an absolute flop.

1094
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,120
It should be everywhere when we're in the NBA finals right now and all that.

1095
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:47,000
ParaDot comes out in a couple of months and I don't think anyone's going to care.

1096
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
What?

1097
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Exactly.

1098
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
What was it?

1099
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:57,280
ParaDot, their original monster type of game is coming out.

1100
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:03,080
I think Niantic at this point is also leaning in a lot to selling their tech to other companies.

1101
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,680
That part is smart.

1102
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:09,600
That part is smart and it will probably be ultimately what keeps Niantic afloat because

1103
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,640
a lot of these game decisions are just not great for the company.

1104
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:24,120
Anyway, let's see, SD100Matt says, Edwove Niantic said, I'm paraphrasing to some degree,

1105
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:28,340
it's not about the taking the shortcut to reach the goal, it's about the journey to

1106
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,660
reach that goal.

1107
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:34,420
So it's about many of us rural players driving 30 minutes to go to raids to only maybe get

1108
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,760
two to three people and not win.

1109
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,280
If Niantic was going to do this, then that should have been coupled with, here is what

1110
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,920
we're adding to the game so that when you go to a raid, you have the people to do it

1111
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,960
or you can find the people to do the raid, which I guess they're leaning into campfire

1112
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,040
to some of that, but campfire isn't even available worldwide still.

1113
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:59,400
So there's a lot of that that just, it doesn't work.

1114
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:05,600
So anyway, SD100Matt says, Niantic isn't getting any of my money anymore, not for their stale

1115
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:11,040
community days, Go Fest and other stale events because they do not focus on innovating.

1116
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,160
And Niantic has the ability to generate events.

1117
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:20,000
If they wanted to generate events, they have a map on their website, community.day, that

1118
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,160
shows all of the hotbeds around the world, all of the parks, and I would bet they could

1119
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:32,040
run a script to see, do they have a location within 50 miles of anyone?

1120
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,760
And there might be some places they would need to get additional coverage, but I would

1121
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:39,560
bet the majority of America probably has one of these places within 50 miles of them.

1122
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,840
If not, that's something Niantic can work on by looking at the hotbeds where people

1123
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,880
are playing.

1124
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,620
Why do they have to run a Pokemon day only in Vegas?

1125
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,600
Why can't they run an event worldwide?

1126
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,040
And if they want people to gather at a certain spot, an accessible place that anybody can

1127
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:04,520
get around at, like the Capitol Park is one of the ones here, then you could do the event

1128
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,520
there.

1129
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:12,120
And that would encourage, give people incentive and a more reason to gather in person.

1130
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,880
Don't take away a reason to play the game the way people have been playing.

1131
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,460
That's what it boils down to at the end of the day.

1132
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:23,040
And I think it's an ill-advised decision, obviously.

1133
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,040
So anyway.

1134
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,400
I'm still justifying deleting it off of my phone two years ago, so.

1135
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,600
Oh yeah, and there's a lot of people that are doing it now.

1136
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:40,700
But to those people, specifically the ones deleting it over this, I'm going to ask a

1137
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,360
very tough question.

1138
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:52,120
When Niantic releases Arceus or a new shiny or that new must-have Pokemon, when they release

1139
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,940
that, are you going to be willing to keep that game off your phone?

1140
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:00,080
Because that's the only way the message is going to be received.

1141
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,920
So I hope you all stick to it.

1142
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,200
Just forget it exists, and then it's great.

1143
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,240
Every time someone brings up Niantic or Pokemon, like, oh yeah, that's still a thing, and then

1144
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,460
I promptly forget about it again.

1145
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,120
And I'm going to say this to the other side.

1146
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,120
I do have good things to say about Niantic.

1147
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,500
I wouldn't have some of the closest friends I have if it wasn't for Ingress.

1148
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:25,740
I've met people through Ingress that I legitimately hang out with outside of the context of the

1149
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,620
game because I just like them as people.

1150
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,060
There's been a lot of good stuff there, and I understand.

1151
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:34,540
I understand why Niantic wants to replicate that experience.

1152
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,180
They're just going about it the wrong way.

1153
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,180
That's what it is.

1154
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:40,660
And as far as Pikmin goes, I credit Pikmin.

1155
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,980
I do, in large part.

1156
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,260
I credit myself, and I credit a lot of things that I did, but I credit Pikmin in large part

1157
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:53,140
for being the incentive for why I lost 50 pounds when I needed to last year.

1158
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,380
Pikmin was a huge incentive in that.

1159
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:01,300
Honestly, I give the credit 100% to you and just that you found tools to make it happen.

1160
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,340
Well thank you, yes, but I will say Pikmin was a tool for me.

1161
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:11,180
It was a game to play, a goal line to keep going for that I kept being motivated to leave

1162
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,500
the house and go for when, you know.

1163
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,580
These are my motivations.

1164
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:20,540
My Apple Watch and my Bullet Journal, because I like fitting in those goals that say that

1165
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,460
I did what I set out to do.

1166
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,380
The fitness watches are really good for that type of stuff, too.

1167
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,380
They are.

1168
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,180
But anyway, all right.

1169
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,860
We could probably spend a three-hour show just talking about those changes, but we're

1170
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,820
going to move on to some other headlines.

1171
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:36,620
Let's move on to this next headline, Dark Sakura.

1172
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:43,900
All right, well speaking of, you know, we're actually going to not even speak of Pokemon

1173
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:48,420
anymore for a minute and go on to another fun little game called Vampire Survivors.

1174
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:50,260
We love this game, right?

1175
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,340
Yeah, I love Vampire Survivors.

1176
01:05:53,060 --> 01:06:01,700
But anyway, it actually beat out God of War Ragnarok for Best Game Award at the BAFTA

1177
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:02,180
Awards.

1178
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:09,300
And while God of War Ragnarok was the most nominated game, this one took the game of

1179
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:09,620
the year.

1180
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,740
I think it's awesome.

1181
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:16,420
And it won not just Best Game, but Best Design as well.

1182
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:20,660
Elden Ring and Tunic were also multi-award winners.

1183
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:27,780
But I mean, the fact that this beat out, you know, Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok and

1184
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:32,660
all of these others, it's pretty amazing, I think.

1185
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:36,420
Only the greatest minds know to put Vampire Survivors as their game of the year.

1186
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:39,140
I saw them play that game.

1187
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,100
I really need to.

1188
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,580
You do.

1189
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,140
You really do.

1190
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:47,380
Yoshida Shuhei was also given a BAFTA fellowship.

1191
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:48,820
Sorry, fellowship.

1192
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,140
That's the Corsoni executive.

1193
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:57,540
And it's the highest, you know, award or accolade that can be given by the Academy.

1194
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:02,740
And others who have received it are Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, David Attenborough,

1195
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,860
Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, and Martin Scorsese.

1196
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:11,780
You know, other people who received it have been Miyamoto, who was actually the first

1197
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:20,740
Asian citizen to get the award, Kojima, Molyneux, Bushnell, Newell, Carmack, lots of big names,

1198
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,460
lots of people.

1199
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:28,100
But the top British game to win the award this year was Rollerdrome, which I haven't

1200
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:37,620
played, you know, lots of really good just voice acting credits, you know, different

1201
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,180
people.

1202
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:45,700
I think that it's fantastic who has been, what games and who has been honored in this

1203
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,020
one.

1204
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,020
So I'm quite pleased.

1205
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,620
You know what the best evolving game has been?

1206
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,940
Final Fantasy XIV.

1207
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,180
I would figure that or No Man's Sky, honestly.

1208
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,300
There we go.

1209
01:07:59,300 --> 01:07:59,800
Nice.

1210
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,460
Well, thank you for the update from the Baftas and what's happening overseas.

1211
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:05,700
Let's move on.

1212
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:06,200
Loki.

1213
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:07,780
All right.

1214
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:14,500
So we've got word that the PlayStation VR2 headsets aren't selling as many units as they

1215
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,700
probably would have liked.

1216
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:20,420
So right now it's projected that they've sold less than 300,000 units in the first month

1217
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:23,860
saying, and because of that, critics are saying that maybe they should have dropped the price

1218
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,700
or added backwards compatibility.

1219
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:30,900
I think it's also too hard to tell right now because overall, I think AR and VR headsets

1220
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,540
are down.

1221
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:37,460
It looks like about 40% over a six month period, which was ending in 2023.

1222
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,940
So I don't know, give it time.

1223
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,940
But yes, I do think it's expensive.

1224
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:46,180
Also launch games, not a lot.

1225
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:51,460
You know, their system seller that they wanted to like kind of put out there for Horizon.

1226
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,860
Um, not as good as they would have liked it to have been.

1227
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:59,620
Resident Evil 4 probably will help when that comes out.

1228
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:02,740
You know, I think that's actually already out now, but that'll help.

1229
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:08,580
But I think they need something that is a system seller because honestly, like for me,

1230
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:14,900
like if I wanted to get into something like that to play just that wonderful on rails

1231
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:20,020
coaster shooter game, I am not dropping over $1,000 to do that.

1232
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,180
So it doesn't make any sense.

1233
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:25,460
It's just such a barrier to entry to get into that.

1234
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:29,940
So I think the cost needs to come down significantly to get new adopters in.

1235
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,980
And then on top of that, you know, backwards compatibility, which is just not going to

1236
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:38,740
happen, would at least incentivize people to purchase it that may have a PlayStation

1237
01:09:38,740 --> 01:09:42,900
VR one to, you know, bring over their library.

1238
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,580
But since they can't do that, well, so I guess you just have to play on PC.

1239
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:51,300
Grant and we've gone over this before that the changes in tech are what's making that

1240
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:51,860
difficult.

1241
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:58,340
I'll give Sony a certain amount of credit for that is that, you know, the tech changes

1242
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:03,620
are what's and that's why games like No Man's Sky are re-releasing on VR too, because

1243
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,900
they have to basically, you know, be updated for the new tech.

1244
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,180
That part I get.

1245
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:12,500
But it's exactly what you said when it comes to the launch titles just aren't there,

1246
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,820
especially for a one thousand dollar entry.

1247
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:21,300
If you don't have a PlayStation five already, there's not one game is not enough or it's

1248
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,740
got to be a hell of a game.

1249
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:24,420
You know, it's got to be like amazing.

1250
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,700
It's got to be Wii Sports level moving systems.

1251
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,060
It's got to be that level.

1252
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:30,820
Like they don't have enough of that.

1253
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:32,500
It looks good.

1254
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,140
Like the Horizon game looks good.

1255
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:40,740
Like it's a very nice looking game, but it doesn't play like a Horizon game.

1256
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:43,940
It's not like a brand like that level of gameplay.

1257
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:47,300
You're not like it's not a God of War or Last of Us or anything like that.

1258
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,180
It's just it's it's it's a neat tech demo for what you can do.

1259
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:57,220
It's basically a climbing game, which I mean, that's not what people want to play.

1260
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,460
They want to play a full fledged game.

1261
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:05,460
Like if it was like Grand Theft Auto five VR and it was the full game and I could play

1262
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,180
it in VR.

1263
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,460
Yeah, I mean, that could probably sell some systems.

1264
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:14,820
I respectfully I kind of think Grand Theft Auto five is super old news at this point.

1265
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:19,140
And I think maybe a new Grand Theft Auto game that is made for VR rather than to just shoe

1266
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,140
horning an old game into VR, I think would be a better approach.

1267
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:28,100
We'll just have to wait for the the the meta group to to port over San Andreas, because

1268
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,860
remember, that was their announcement that they're bringing San Andreas over to that.

1269
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,740
So you want to talk about old game shoehorn to the VR.

1270
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,980
That's a pretty old game, the shoehorn into VR.

1271
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:44,900
But I mean, yeah, like I understand that, like, you know, a new game for sure.

1272
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:50,020
But Grand Theft Auto five, like we already have a, you know, first person mode in that

1273
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,820
it wouldn't be too difficult, I would think, to be able to port in VR controls.

1274
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,620
In fact, there are mods out there for PC that you can do that.

1275
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,540
I just think something like that would be an easy win.

1276
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:05,300
But yeah, until you get something that like people really need to buy and remember, you're

1277
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,380
just you're trying to get people to buy something.

1278
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,980
Not only to play PlayStation five, they don't own one already, but now you have to buy

1279
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:15,540
another piece of kit that's just as expensive as a PlayStation five.

1280
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:20,660
That's a lot to ask in a recession, since we're going to use it as excuse there.

1281
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:26,580
It's just I don't know, it's a hard sell, especially also people are waiting for like,

1282
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:31,060
you know, the meta quest three to see what that's all about and what the price point

1283
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,380
is, because the price point is most definitely probably going to be less.

1284
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,780
And it's just it's easier.

1285
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,940
I only have to buy that and then I can buy software for it and then I'm good to go.

1286
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:43,140
Like, so it's a hard sell.

1287
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:46,420
Let me get some comments to chat over at twitch.tv social network.

1288
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:51,220
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, tech analysts will always say not enough sales drop the

1289
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:51,860
price.

1290
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:55,300
What they don't know is that even if Sony dropped the price, there isn't going to be

1291
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,580
that demand unless you have that must have PSVR two game.

1292
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:02,980
And Shane says, Shad Leland says, I think the PSVR two is great.

1293
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:03,940
I know he has one.

1294
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:05,700
I love mine for what I've played on it.

1295
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:09,060
However, I've only used it three times since I got it.

1296
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:13,140
Too many good games that keep coming out that push it farther down my list of things to

1297
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:13,460
play.

1298
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:17,460
Fixie said something that led to a brain spark on my end.

1299
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,900
I want to get to this fixation gaze and chat says, I would love to see Pokemon in VR or

1300
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,100
Legend of Zelda.

1301
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,020
And Jamie, you're in chat too.

1302
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:30,180
And I quite frankly, I was I was taken aback by this comment.

1303
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:34,740
You said in a good way, you said Breath of the Wild would be the thing that would drag

1304
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,620
me into VR.

1305
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:41,620
Yeah, because I just want to walk around, you know, and I think, well, you know, the

1306
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,740
VR stuff gives me like a pretty bad, bad headache.

1307
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:52,260
Um, but I mean, I want an official Breath of the Wild in VR, not a fan project.

1308
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,100
Yeah, in Labo.

1309
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,580
But you're really a thing on Switch.

1310
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,060
Okay, okay, okay.

1311
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,980
So I want like a real VR experience, not Labo.

1312
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,060
Okay, but here's here's the thing.

1313
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,860
So we're all waiting for the Switch successor, right?

1314
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:15,460
What if the Switch successor now I and I don't know how much I expect Nintendo to jump into

1315
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,220
this, but I'm going to throw it out there.

1316
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:22,180
What if the whole thing with the Switch successor is it's the Switch, but it's the Switch 3.

1317
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:27,140
And the reason why they call it the Switch 3 and not the Switch 2 is that it's handheld,

1318
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,620
TV, and VR.

1319
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:35,540
Because do a thing with that screen, very similar to how Labo was all set up, but this

1320
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:39,060
time the device is built for it.

1321
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:42,660
And the third Switch, so you could, it switches three ways.

1322
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:44,740
It's a three-way device.

1323
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:49,140
I know it's, I, at the end of the day, I'm not sure I see Nintendo getting into this

1324
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:54,420
market at all, but it's a very interesting sort of, that's something they could do to

1325
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,660
the Switch to make it switchier.

1326
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,700
It would be horrible is what it would be.

1327
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:05,780
It would be absolutely horrible because one, you can't, you cannot put that much power

1328
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,340
into a handheld device like that right now.

1329
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:15,220
Two, the screen resolution that they're running on that is 720p, which I've played Labo VR.

1330
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,260
It's awful.

1331
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,180
It's not good looking.

1332
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,060
It's cool.

1333
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,580
It's a cool concept.

1334
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:21,860
It just does not work.

1335
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:28,740
Loki, that's all you need because the Switch wasn't designed to do this, but even the

1336
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:33,860
fact that you said it's cool, it just wasn't designed to do it, could be fixed.

1337
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:39,700
Go back though, at that low of a resolution, especially for folks like me that are prone

1338
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,620
to migraines, it would be a nightmare, an absolute nightmare.

1339
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:46,340
You have to have quality if you're going to do a VR unit.

1340
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:49,700
And something that technology six years later could hopefully improve on.

1341
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:54,820
If they would maybe like 30 years, they might get on board with that.

1342
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:56,980
They're going to get on board with that when the train's already left.

1343
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,900
Like there is no way that they're going to do this anytime soon because they're making

1344
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,300
hand over fist money with what they've got right now.

1345
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:06,740
They're not going to like pivot until they need to pivot.

1346
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:11,140
This is why I'm not really willing to put this on the record as an official.

1347
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,580
I believe as somebody in chat said earlier, Rob Stradamus prediction.

1348
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:15,460
I'm not putting it there.

1349
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:20,980
I'm just saying, ooh, I never thought of that before today, but that's a way that the switch

1350
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:22,020
could get switchier.

1351
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,940
And that's exactly the line.

1352
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,780
Put it on the back of the box.

1353
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,380
The switch gets switchier.

1354
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:34,660
Now, like the new generation, this device participates in three ways way more often.

1355
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:41,300
Well, the only way that this would take off, like you'd have to have, okay, Apple releasing

1356
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,700
their VR headset, which are already rumors.

1357
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,300
That's going to be several thousand dollars, but people will pay the Apple tax.

1358
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,500
I know that absolutely.

1359
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,500
So you get the wide adoption of VR with that.

1360
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,140
Then maybe they may switch to that as far as the thing.

1361
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,980
But right now, I think the direction they would go with that is consoles are getting

1362
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,100
more powerful.

1363
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,740
People have seen what the steam deck can do.

1364
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:07,460
They're just going to put out a more powerful handheld and that'll be that.

1365
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:11,060
And it'll be the same stuff over and over and over again until

1366
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:18,340
there's a mass adoption where Microsoft and Sony are all releasing VR centric head systems.

1367
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,700
They're not going to pivot to that.

1368
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:27,140
I mean, I would like to think that they're trendsetters, but I think that ship has sailed

1369
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:27,700
as well.

1370
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,460
They were trendsetters when the Wii came out, and now they've been just kind of refining

1371
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,420
that Wii process.

1372
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,900
And now it's just kind of a novel thing.

1373
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:40,980
Like how many games do people really actively take part in using the motion controls for

1374
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:45,300
the Switch Sports is about it.

1375
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,260
And that's because people like the nostalgia of going back to that.

1376
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:52,660
I know my kids like playing or at least one of them likes playing the Switch Sports stuff

1377
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,980
just because it's just fun and novel.

1378
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:59,700
But like any other games, no, they're not using the motion controls because it's a handheld

1379
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,980
system they're using as a handheld.

1380
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:06,420
So if they're downplaying the features that they're building into this thing for one

1381
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:07,380
already.

1382
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:12,820
And also they're touting it as like a family system, a co-op same screen type of system

1383
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:13,140
thing.

1384
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,340
And I just don't see them doing that.

1385
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,940
Yeah, they experimented with the little mini system where you can't take the Joy-Cons

1386
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:20,580
off anymore.

1387
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:27,060
But I just can't shake the whole.

1388
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:31,460
You're right that the VR landscape might be changing pretty soon when certain players

1389
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,340
get in the market.

1390
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:37,780
But I just can't shake that feeling of that.

1391
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:42,340
It does this, this and this without extra wires or any of that.

1392
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:46,100
I just that's very, it's a very appealing marketing gimmick.

1393
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:49,540
Oh, go ahead.

1394
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:56,180
I was just going back to thinking about Labo because that being Nintendo's attempt at VR.

1395
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,980
They could have done so much more with it, but it didn't get the support.

1396
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:08,500
And I'm also thinking in terms of just that, you know, there are some technologies that

1397
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,900
the general public isn't going to be ready for.

1398
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:14,260
And I think VR right now is just is one of those.

1399
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:20,020
The problem with Labo is it was, it's fun to build all the things for it, but it's so

1400
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:20,500
gimmicky.

1401
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,220
And then you're left with a bunch of like stuff like, what am I going to do with all

1402
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:23,540
this?

1403
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,820
I threw mine away.

1404
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,900
Meaning the Labo VR, sorry.

1405
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,940
No, I threw mine away.

1406
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:31,220
I threw my Labo VR away because it was a ton.

1407
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:35,940
It was a ton of cardboard that like it took up a ton of space and there was no place to

1408
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:36,420
store it.

1409
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,020
They have like a little flimsy like stand you can make to like stack some of the stuff,

1410
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,180
but like it took up so much space.

1411
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:45,940
And each one of those devices is used for one game within this.

1412
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:49,700
It is it is like third party.

1413
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,980
We accessory like nightmare stuff that they had.

1414
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,500
And it's a it's a neat concept to get people playing games and stuff like that.

1415
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:02,660
But it's, they then pivoted that into, uh, was it a game builder garage, which nobody

1416
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:03,460
talks about anymore.

1417
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:06,180
It probably does anything with like, cause that's once again, that's something that's

1418
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:07,060
not been a focus.

1419
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:12,740
It was a neat idea, but they didn't support it and too much beyond like just what they

1420
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:13,540
had out for it.

1421
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:18,100
And they did like this weird thing with, uh, Mario Odyssey with Labo VR.

1422
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:18,900
And it was awful.

1423
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:21,620
It was awful to like, look at it cause the screen was so blurry.

1424
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:28,180
And I tried the one thing on yours and it made me pretty sick.

1425
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:33,220
You know, I mean, one would have expected that Nintendo would have been better.

1426
01:20:33,860 --> 01:20:40,420
I really feel like this Labo thing is getting taken too literally as what the VR that Nintendo

1427
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:41,380
could produce could be.

1428
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:43,940
I see Labo as a proof of concept and nothing more.

1429
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:44,580
And that's it.

1430
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,620
Concept.

1431
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:46,340
That's it.

1432
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:47,940
Not actual execution.

1433
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:51,300
But anyway, it's, um, I just keep an eye on time.

1434
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,700
We're very passionate tonight on all these topics.

1435
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,380
Let's try to move through these next few stories.

1436
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,340
We're going to get to the classic game of, or excuse me, actually tonight we have an

1437
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:02,020
on-game game of, or no, a non-video game tonight.

1438
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:03,540
It's a non-video game game.

1439
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,340
Non-video game game.

1440
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,500
We're going to get to that in a little bit, but first we have a few more stories including,

1441
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,660
oh yes, April Fool's day was yesterday.

1442
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:13,620
We talked about that a little bit at the top of the show, how I think most of us are kind

1443
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:19,300
of over April Fool's day, but occasionally there are still some hah sorts that elicit

1444
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:22,740
that singular hah that come out of these sorts of things.

1445
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,300
And I would say this was it from Sega.

1446
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:32,100
Sega for April, Sega for April Fool's day released a game called the murder of Sonic

1447
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,140
the Hedgehog.

1448
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:35,380
It was a free adventure game for PCs.

1449
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,900
It's actually still available on Steam.

1450
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:39,140
Yeah, on Steam.

1451
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:39,640
Great.

1452
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:46,260
It's Amy Rose's murder mystery birthday party and Sonic dies.

1453
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:48,260
And so now you have to find out what happened.

1454
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:50,260
So I guess you could say it's a visual novel.

1455
01:21:50,980 --> 01:21:54,420
So I don't know if it's like a Danganronpa type of thing or maybe a little simpler than

1456
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:59,460
that, but you interrogate the guests and so forth and try to figure out what's going

1457
01:21:59,460 --> 01:21:59,960
on.

1458
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:04,420
Sega has the direction of Danganronpa though.

1459
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,220
Probably not to that extreme, but I got the game.

1460
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,580
But anyway, yeah, those, those types of things.

1461
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:13,220
That's when April Fool's day is funny and actually cute.

1462
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,820
So I thought that was cool.

1463
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,500
Um, you know, that's how hot to full boyfriend started.

1464
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,300
Yeah.

1465
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:19,620
Right.

1466
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:23,380
Well online April Fool's joke and to bring things full circle.

1467
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:28,580
Pokemon go started as the Google maps April Fool's joke about three years prior.

1468
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:32,260
So sometimes pretty legit things come from April Fool's day.

1469
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:35,220
There was some other silly, silly stuff like the Blizzard Diablo.

1470
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,140
Twitter was announcing all this nonsense.

1471
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,460
Although I don't know, it was, they were doing things like the butcher will manifest in real

1472
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:44,420
life and come strangle or come slaughter you.

1473
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,540
That was the word slaughter you.

1474
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:49,860
And I just replied, I put slaughter me daddy because they had a picture of the butcher.

1475
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:54,020
I agree with, with Gwen Pudding.

1476
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,700
Um, we must find the pudding.

1477
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:04,420
Also they see sometimes the fans do somewhat amusing things on Reddit, the world of Warcraft

1478
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:09,700
or wow Reddit and the final fantasy 14 Reddit literally swapped skins for the day.

1479
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:14,180
So when you went to the wow Reddit, it said final fantasy 14 and Walker, all the topics

1480
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:17,700
and posts were still there, but it was also the mods behind the scenes.

1481
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,260
Both agree.

1482
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,140
I love that.

1483
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:25,220
So world of Warcraft fans and Final Fantasy 14 fans coming together to achieve total internet

1484
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:26,020
fuckery.

1485
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:26,900
You love to see it.

1486
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:33,780
I like the IGNs where they had like a video talking about those features being added by

1487
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:34,420
Nintendo.

1488
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:38,660
They did like a mock Nintendo direct where they're adding voice lines from the Mario

1489
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,020
movie into like Mario games.

1490
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:40,900
No, I hated that.

1491
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:42,660
Silly.

1492
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,540
Hated it.

1493
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:46,500
All right, moving on Dark Sakura.

1494
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:54,100
All right, well multiverses, um, their open beta is going to be closing on June 25th.

1495
01:23:54,660 --> 01:24:01,620
The full launch is ready for early 2024 with some new features and new modes, but that

1496
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,860
free to play one is going away.

1497
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:16,500
Um, I, uh, according to their FAQ, um, again, June 25th, um, and they haven't yet provided

1498
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,580
the time, but they will closer they get to it.

1499
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:25,300
Um, and then they said that it's closing because they've got lots of feedback and they

1500
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:30,580
have some work to do along with the net code and matchmaking and working on the progression

1501
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:31,300
systems.

1502
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:39,860
So they are again targeting early 2024 and it will be removed from digital storefronts

1503
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:43,220
and unavailable for download beginning on April 4th.

1504
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,780
So Tuesday.

1505
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:47,300
Yeah.

1506
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,460
If you're going to get it, now's the time.

1507
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:53,460
But yeah, I'm surprised that that was in beta.

1508
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,580
Like I thought that came out.

1509
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,740
I thought they were selling DLC for that and everything.

1510
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:58,260
I think it's a convenient.

1511
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:00,580
There's more.

1512
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:01,080
Okay.

1513
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:05,860
The season two battle pass, which is supposed to end on March 31st will be extended through

1514
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:06,660
June 25th.

1515
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:12,500
Um, and so the daily missions will keep going and the battle pass points and all of that

1516
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,860
until the game is taken offline.

1517
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:18,100
There will be no more, the weekly seasonal milestones.

1518
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:19,620
So there you go.

1519
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:27,620
So season two in an open beta, but one good thing is that for any content that you've

1520
01:25:27,620 --> 01:25:30,980
earned or purchased in game will carry over to the full version of the game.

1521
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,340
I have a feeling a lot of this is because there's less and less people playing multiverses.

1522
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:42,180
And so they're gonna, they're Final Fantasy 14 it, they're going to take it down to fix

1523
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:47,140
it all up and get to relaunch it again and get all the press release and stuff and get

1524
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,260
another go at fixing some of the problems people have with it first time.

1525
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,620
I think that's exactly what this is.

1526
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,260
So I know.

1527
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:54,740
Yep.

1528
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:56,420
But it's their decision.

1529
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:56,920
Yeah.

1530
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:58,580
All right.

1531
01:25:58,580 --> 01:25:59,540
Moving on Loki.

1532
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:08,180
So Australia, um, their government wants to give 18 plus ratings to any game with simulated

1533
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:09,620
gambling in it.

1534
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:16,820
And that could be anything that includes like actual gambling to loot boxes.

1535
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:22,420
So anything that actually has like a loot box or some sort of like random element to,

1536
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:27,620
you know, unlocking things that you pay for would be considered an M rated game.

1537
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,660
Would a stock market simulation be considered an M rated game then?

1538
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,380
I mean, it is, it is gambling.

1539
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:37,300
It seems like, so yeah, I would think that that does, um, you know, this

1540
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:41,300
Bobby Black Wolf with an excellent point with super Mario brothers three toad house, would

1541
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,780
that be considered a M rated cause it's gambling.

1542
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:48,420
I think it's because you're actually, they're talking about stuff that you pay for like

1543
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,620
with money in the game.

1544
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:55,380
So like if, if for example, in super Mario brothers three toad house, if they did the

1545
01:26:55,380 --> 01:27:01,220
re-release of that game where I could buy toad coins with real money and then buy stuff

1546
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,500
randomly toad house, then yes, that would be a mature rated game.

1547
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:06,740
I don't like that.

1548
01:27:07,780 --> 01:27:08,020
Yeah.

1549
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:12,180
So if, if, um, you know, they're talking about like, you know, so like, for example, like

1550
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:17,220
Roblox or something like that, if you like pay Roblox to unlock a loot box, it's got

1551
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:20,900
random stuff in it, then that would be an M rated game.

1552
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:27,700
Um, so, and that of course affects, you know, EA's, FIFA and Madden and all that stuff

1553
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:28,020
too.

1554
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:30,020
So good.

1555
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:35,700
See, as far as like the, the loot box argument goes, it seems a little late to the party,

1556
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:41,460
but I mean, I still feel like there's a lot that needs to be kind of quantified in there

1557
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,140
about what does gambling really mean?

1558
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:47,220
But I think if you're talking about the real money currency, then, then it makes a lot

1559
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:47,780
more sense.

1560
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:52,020
As long as they're kind of saying real money to this, I, it makes a lot more sense.

1561
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:58,900
But now here's the thing though, is M rating in Australia doesn't necessarily mean over

1562
01:27:58,900 --> 01:27:59,460
18.

1563
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:02,100
It means, you know, 15 plus.

1564
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,860
So, you know, it's recommended for people over 15.

1565
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:07,940
So imagine like a teen rated game.

1566
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:14,260
It won't legally keep games out of the kids' hands, but, uh, they said that the, oh, the

1567
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:19,220
stricter MA 15 plus legally restricts the product of over age of 15.

1568
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:23,540
So it's not that it's going to prevent kids from buying it.

1569
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,580
It's just going to be like rated higher, which parents don't read that anyway.

1570
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:32,100
So, you know, kids will still have them, but it's a start, I guess.

1571
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:33,860
All right.

1572
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:40,500
Well, moving on to the end of Steam on some platforms, but it's not what you think.

1573
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,940
Steam is going to stop supporting Windows 7 and Windows 8.

1574
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:51,300
Next year in 2024, uh, from the 1st of January, 2024, Steam will no longer work on Windows

1575
01:28:51,300 --> 01:29:00,260
7, 8, and nope, not even 8.1, uh, in an update that, um, I'm assuming that is already sunsetted

1576
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,260
with XP, uh, to be quick.

1577
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,060
No, I want Steam on Windows 3.11 for networking.

1578
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:10,020
Which honestly, honestly, pour one out for the old show computer we used to use up until

1579
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:16,020
the Twitch with the Twitch transition in 20 at the end of 2018, right?

1580
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,660
December, 2018 was the Twitch transition.

1581
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:24,260
We moved to a Mac mini to do video, but up until then 2018, I was running the show on

1582
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:29,620
a Windows XP computer and I got shit for it all the time, but I was like, Hey, if it ain't

1583
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:31,860
broke, I ain't fixing it.

1584
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:32,820
End of story.

1585
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:38,260
Finally, all these years later, now it's being broadcast for Windows 11.

1586
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:40,740
So I'll be fine from the Steam front and all that stuff.

1587
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:45,220
But anyway, uh, there are still people out there running Windows 7 and 8.

1588
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:49,060
They have not yet taken the leap to even 10, uh, or 11.

1589
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:53,300
But, uh, that's their problem and not everybody else's.

1590
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:53,860
Yeah.

1591
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:54,980
But you know, if you-

1592
01:29:54,980 --> 01:29:58,020
Security concern, considering that they've stopped supporting it.

1593
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:02,660
Or maybe you want to consider a dual boot for like Linux or something that Steam is

1594
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,380
supporting it on.

1595
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:03,780
I don't know.

1596
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:08,340
But the point is, it ain't going to work for you as of January 1st.

1597
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:13,940
So if you want to continue to run Steam, including any game or product through the platform,

1598
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:16,180
that could be a yikes for some people too.

1599
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:18,340
You're going to need to update Windows.

1600
01:30:19,220 --> 01:30:26,660
And for the five people who will be all up in arms about it, the company is not responsible

1601
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:27,940
for you being on obsolete tech.

1602
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:33,140
Mm-hmm, bonds 006 says Windows XP.

1603
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,900
Dan, you are a legend for that, Rob.

1604
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:35,780
Oh, thank you.

1605
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:37,780
Flattery will get you everywhere.

1606
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:38,500
Thank you.

1607
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:42,820
Uh, DJ Rob S says, of course, unless I'm a legend in a wanted poster somewhere.

1608
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:45,060
Uh, DJ Rob S says support has ended.

1609
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:48,900
Only select companies are paying for extended Windows 7 support.

1610
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:50,900
And Valve clearly isn't one of them.

1611
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,500
All right.

1612
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:58,340
I just think it was funny that the one time Dan thought he was going to do me a good deed

1613
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:00,580
and upgrade the OS on my old PC.

1614
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,900
Windows ME broke it.

1615
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:05,540
All right.

1616
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:10,660
We are going to take a trip down memory lane for our next segment.

1617
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:11,620
Let's get to it.

1618
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:27,540
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

1619
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,780
out a classic and tell you about it.

1620
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:33,060
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1621
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:40,980
But as we know, in this twist, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game once a month each month

1622
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:43,140
in 20- each month of the year in 2023.

1623
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,020
What did you pick tonight?

1624
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:46,180
I picked the Bop-It.

1625
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:47,700
Bop-It.

1626
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:51,140
The most annoying toy in the world.

1627
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:51,540
Pull it.

1628
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,740
Oh, my mother's had one.

1629
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:55,700
I hated that thing.

1630
01:31:55,700 --> 01:32:06,500
Anyway, Bop-It is an audio gaming toy, sort of- I'd say not unlike the Simon that I did

1631
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,140
last month.

1632
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:12,820
And it would give you a series of audio commands that, you know, had a little voice recorded

1633
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:20,340
through a speaker and you would have to do those commands when it says that with it getting

1634
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:21,620
increasingly more difficult.

1635
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:29,620
Which I randomly one night got really bored and found someone get the world Bop-It record

1636
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,340
on YouTube.

1637
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:32,500
I'm like, whatever.

1638
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,900
Like speed running Bop-It.

1639
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:47,380
But anyway, it was a really popular thing, I think.

1640
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:49,060
I mean, like I said, my brothers had it.

1641
01:32:49,620 --> 01:33:00,820
And it had- there's a statement on here about people were actually using it to engage in

1642
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:07,700
social behavior and that there were various different versions that were released and

1643
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:18,500
even a diagnostic mode that would tell you like what version of the little system it

1644
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:18,740
was.

1645
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:29,940
So at any rate, it sold a bunch and there were just so many things out.

1646
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,460
But we'll go ahead and start with the very beginning.

1647
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:41,860
So 1986, the instructions were copyrighted and then the game was the first of what was

1648
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:45,940
going to become a series of Bop-It games with, you know, the basic patent.

1649
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,380
The original game was called Bop-It.

1650
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:53,780
It had three inputs, a pressable button in the center, a twist-it lever, and a pull-it

1651
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:54,100
lever.

1652
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:00,260
In three game modes, there was solo bop, vox bop, and beat bop.

1653
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:07,700
So you would have those different means of playing and it would give you the command

1654
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,780
and you had to do the command in the right amount of time.

1655
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:15,380
So, you know, you had your little twist-it crank and it made a little noise and

1656
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:22,820
at any rate, your score comes out with a maximum value up to 100.

1657
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:28,340
There's a different model in 2000 that could score up to 200.

1658
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:39,060
And each pull-it whistle, like at its end sequence, would denote 100 points and each

1659
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:40,820
ratchet denotes 10.

1660
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,580
And then a drumbeat would do one point.

1661
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:46,660
So if you reach 200 points, the game will play a victory song.

1662
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:53,380
And then they repeated this in later models and the Zingit spin-off.

1663
01:34:55,220 --> 01:35:00,180
But the cipher values were used for all of the subsequent Bop-It ciphers.

1664
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,460
The original one used three AA batteries.

1665
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:08,500
Following that was the Bop-It Extreme, which looks like a really bizarre steering wheel.

1666
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:18,260
It came out in 1998, where the patent was filed with other patents as pending.

1667
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:25,940
It had the additional commands of flick-it with a green zigzag lever and spin-it, which

1668
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:31,460
was a wheel at the end, a red wheel, and it had four game modes.

1669
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:40,820
So it added in beat bop, it had vox bop, beat bop, vox bop solo, and beat bop solo,

1670
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:46,580
I can't say those words, with a maximum score increase of 250.

1671
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:50,900
And it had like different victory songs that you would get.

1672
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:54,340
And it also ran on three AA batteries.

1673
01:35:54,340 --> 01:35:59,380
And as of 2003, this was actually one of the most popular games on the market.

1674
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:07,780
Then out came a Bop-It Extreme 2, which basically had like some clear elements, but all the

1675
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,340
same shit.

1676
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:12,660
And it was awarded the Electronic Game of the Year in 2005 in the UK.

1677
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:14,820
It also required three AA batteries.

1678
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:23,300
Some of the inputs were altered, it had volume controls, and it had the scoring just put

1679
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,580
everything out in words.

1680
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:34,740
And there was a German-speaking version that had the name Simon Challenge.

1681
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:38,900
Bratz Bop-It came out, and guess what?

1682
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:39,300
Hell yeah.

1683
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:42,020
It used three AAA batteries.

1684
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:49,700
So then it was more of a layout, like the three input one had the same scoring system,

1685
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:50,820
all the rest of the same stuff.

1686
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:51,620
It was just a repackage.

1687
01:36:52,260 --> 01:37:01,380
Bop-It Blast was developed by Tiger Electronics, and it had the same three input with more

1688
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:02,820
patents pending.

1689
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:05,380
It had an optional female voice.

1690
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:07,860
You could use both voices.

1691
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:09,780
Had victory songs.

1692
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:11,460
It used three AA batteries.

1693
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:14,020
And this high score on it was 500 points.

1694
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:25,540
Then Bop-It Download, which had three game modes, solo, pass it, and one-on-one with

1695
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:28,660
15 levels of difficulty with a max score of 1,000.

1696
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:35,220
And to let you download a program to download new content, it was discontinued when Hasbro

1697
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:38,180
discontinued the item, the download service.

1698
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:44,820
And the level up sound was taken from this Bop-It to be used in later Bop-It models.

1699
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:49,700
So the current versions on the market right now, we have Bop-It exclamation point.

1700
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:57,940
It has options to shout it, which makes you shout into a microphone.

1701
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,580
And then three difficulty levels.

1702
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:05,540
The highest difficulty does voice sound and color commands.

1703
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:08,660
So, and that was the one I watched someone get, by the way.

1704
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,820
That was pretty, pretty intense.

1705
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:19,860
They also added a party mode where you could use body parts like foot, hip, and arm.

1706
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:21,300
Use three AAA batteries.

1707
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,580
And when you turn it off, it says, I'm going to sleep.

1708
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:32,500
And then it had Bop-It bounce, which I don't get this one.

1709
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:38,660
It has a ball and a handheld trampoline, I guess that you could bounce it on.

1710
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,100
That one's weird.

1711
01:38:40,660 --> 01:38:47,380
But there was the Bop-It XT, which was the fourth edition of the Bop-It extreme.

1712
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:49,540
And it had a new command called shake it.

1713
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:58,500
The spin is now an orange is a Bop-It smash, which had a color changing lights in the zone.

1714
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:03,220
And you would smash the two Bop-It buttons together when the light was either green or blue.

1715
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:06,340
And it had many other things.

1716
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:11,860
There's Bop-It Tetris, which I had no idea.

1717
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,060
Bop-It Tetris.

1718
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:14,580
I'm not, I can't even.

1719
01:39:15,460 --> 01:39:22,100
Bop-It Beats, where you have these modes called classic, classic party, DJ, DJ party,

1720
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:26,260
and remix with three difficulty levels, rookie, expert, and lights only.

1721
01:39:27,220 --> 01:39:30,740
You could Bop-It, spin it, scratch it, reverse it, repeat, and flip it.

1722
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:34,500
You can put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1723
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:42,900
No, sorry.

1724
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:47,620
And then there was the Bop-It micro series that were teeny tiny little Bop-Its.

1725
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:51,860
And the other ones that they had different branded ones too.

1726
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:55,940
There was Bop-It R2-D2, BB-8, Groot, and Minion.

1727
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:58,260
Because Minions are on fucking everything.

1728
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,580
There was also an Olaf and a Chewbacca.

1729
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:06,740
And then there's one for the child, AKA Grogu.

1730
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:10,420
The only two names that are acceptable for the creature.

1731
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:16,820
And there's a Spider-Man one and all kinds of other ones.

1732
01:40:16,820 --> 01:40:19,140
And there's even one shaped like Darth Vader.

1733
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:23,700
But the Darth Vader one had Emperor Palpatine saying the commands.

1734
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:24,820
And I don't get that either.

1735
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:30,500
So there were Bop-It New Moves, AKA Bop-It Refresh.

1736
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:36,020
Bop-It Maker, where I guess you could design your own Bop-It stuff.

1737
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,020
It's got different things in there.

1738
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,820
I'm not reading everyone.

1739
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,660
I'm just listing all the names of them now.

1740
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:52,820
There was the original re-release, the classic re-release, the all kinds of modes.

1741
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:55,620
I mean, my goodness, this game mutates.

1742
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:58,580
It is not called that.

1743
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:01,300
It is Grogu or the child.

1744
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,460
We have never seen Yoda as an infant.

1745
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,100
The end.

1746
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:08,100
The random video I came across on YouTube and the recommends for the ones you sent

1747
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,660
had this guy that's got like 40 different Bop-Its.

1748
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:13,060
I was like, there's that many that exist?

1749
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:14,020
My goodness.

1750
01:41:14,420 --> 01:41:20,740
What about the one where finally it's become it's the AI has taken over and now the device bops you?

1751
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:26,420
I saw one that was done at this weird.

1752
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:31,060
So like I used to take my kids to this event that they had back when they're really little,

1753
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:36,740
like they were like babies that basically had a bunch of like cars, like fire trucks

1754
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:37,540
and stuff like that.

1755
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:43,300
But they also had these vehicles that someone made for Burning Man.

1756
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:47,300
And they had a Bop-It with flamethrowers in this big metal cage.

1757
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:48,180
They get to play it.

1758
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:51,940
That's the same people that made the DDR machine that shot fire at you when you got a stamp.

1759
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:52,500
Yeah, probably.

1760
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:53,000
Yeah.

1761
01:41:53,620 --> 01:41:55,780
But obviously it didn't shoot fire at you.

1762
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,620
There are the sister products.

1763
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:01,300
Oh, boy.

1764
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:03,860
Zingit, which is a yo-yo audio game.

1765
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,500
There's Toppit, which is a Kendama style.

1766
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:12,340
You know, the cup ball thing that you do in the cup?

1767
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:14,420
That one exists.

1768
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:20,900
There's one called Torx, which has two twistable circles and two bendable arms that can be

1769
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:23,220
bent in 90 degree angles.

1770
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:25,300
And it sounds too complicated.

1771
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:33,620
And then Groove-It, where very much like the Bop-It games, it uses a photo detection to

1772
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:35,620
determine where your hand position is.

1773
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:38,180
And it uses voice commands.

1774
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:42,980
But now you have the scratch, the slide, the zoom, and it's more tolerant of errors because

1775
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:44,180
of hand things.

1776
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:49,860
And then it's got, like, some of the other ones, as you progress through the game, it's

1777
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:50,360
got...

1778
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:53,140
Fixie.

1779
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:53,700
Okay, I get it.

1780
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:58,260
You didn't see my reaction over here when you were talking about Toppit.

1781
01:42:59,060 --> 01:42:59,700
I did.

1782
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:00,200
I did.

1783
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:06,020
Well, I didn't see your reaction because I was reading the thing, but yeah.

1784
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:07,220
Not that.

1785
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:10,020
You know, and then the sequel, Bottom-It.

1786
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:16,420
They haven't yet come out with Verse-It yet because people are convinced it doesn't exist.

1787
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,540
It's 2023.

1788
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,060
It's perfectly acceptable to cite it.

1789
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:27,780
At any rate, Groove-It also adds other commands like the chop, the zip, the flow, the car

1790
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:31,300
wash, the rock and roll, the kung fu, the swirl, and the hip hop.

1791
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:32,980
And that is it.

1792
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:34,580
Oh, is that all?

1793
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:39,380
Groove is bottom-it.

1794
01:43:40,740 --> 01:43:44,340
I've learned more about a Bop-It than I ever thought I would in my entire life.

1795
01:43:44,340 --> 01:43:49,540
But no, it's fascinating just how many of those fucking things there have been over

1796
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:49,940
the years.

1797
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:50,580
That's for sure.

1798
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:56,980
And my favorite, though, way to do Bop-It is just to smack people in the head with it

1799
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:00,020
when they bother me and say, no, I was just following the game.

1800
01:44:00,020 --> 01:44:01,220
Like I said, Bop-You.

1801
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:08,420
Bop-It is my Bop-It.

1802
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,020
Get out my cane and my Geritol.

1803
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:11,940
We called it dodgeball.

1804
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:14,180
If you didn't dodge, you got bopped.

1805
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,420
I remember Lorena Bop-It.

1806
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:17,700
That was a heck of a trial.

1807
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,220
Oh, my God.

1808
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:23,780
And that poor woman.

1809
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:26,980
Also, what else was I going to say?

1810
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:28,740
I had another joke I was sitting on.

1811
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,780
Oh, well, forget it.

1812
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,940
I don't think her situation was funny, though.

1813
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:33,380
She was an abused woman.

1814
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,300
Damn, I had another dad joke and it left.

1815
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:39,800
Oh, well.

1816
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:42,180
Let's see.

1817
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:43,780
All right, there it is.

1818
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:49,700
Bop-It, your classic not video game game of electronic not video game.

1819
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,580
That's what I'm going to call it.

1820
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,340
All right, of the month.

1821
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:58,020
I'll change the name next month, which, you know, funny enough, a lot of these things

1822
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:00,980
we've been talking about, you know, Simon last month, Bop-It this month, y'all have

1823
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:02,020
played them at some point.

1824
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:02,980
Jenga was one.

1825
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,420
Y'all have played these things.

1826
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:11,380
So you can't say they don't like, you know, have some things in common with video games,

1827
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,700
especially, you know, in regards to the fandom and stuff.

1828
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:17,060
But yeah, anyway, wait till you find out what next month is.

1829
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:17,620
Oh, boy.

1830
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,420
All right.

1831
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:19,300
Are there two?

1832
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:23,460
Actually, that's the part I have been finding fascinating is like the 200 different versions

1833
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:26,180
of Simon and the 200 different versions of Bop-It.

1834
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:28,340
It's like, okay, I legit did not know.

1835
01:45:28,340 --> 01:45:32,740
That's I still don't understand Super Simon, but maybe one day I will.

1836
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,140
Well, we never got it over here.

1837
01:45:35,140 --> 01:45:39,140
I happened to play somebody who lived overseas.

1838
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,580
I played bears.

1839
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:43,220
All right, moving on.

1840
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:47,700
Let's travel around and check out some quick news in rapid fire news.

1841
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:48,200
Loki.

1842
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:49,460
Yes.

1843
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:53,940
So there's been an old Atari game prototype that's been discovered.

1844
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:59,700
So Sonar, which is almost I guess it sort of plays like Battleship.

1845
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:02,260
So that's pretty cool.

1846
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:08,100
So Atari Protos, they says Sonar apparently is missing some features because it's incomplete.

1847
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:17,460
And so some of the hiccups include flickering, which you using the Sonar scan and also has

1848
01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:18,900
one pre-programmed map.

1849
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:20,500
But that's pretty cool.

1850
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:21,700
Something that could have been.

1851
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:27,220
And the ROM itself has been posted to Atari Age if you're interested in checking it out.

1852
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:34,580
Of course, if you have checked out Marvel's Avengers or were planning on doing it,

1853
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:36,420
you got news for you that they're canceling that.

1854
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:42,660
But in the meantime, if you have checked out Marvel Avengers, you can actually get the

1855
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,500
unlocks for the game for free.

1856
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:49,220
They've unlocked pretty much everything for the game for free because, yes, it is being

1857
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:52,740
taken offline, but that's pretty cool.

1858
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:57,860
So the marketplace has been mostly unlocked thanks to the update.

1859
01:46:57,860 --> 01:47:01,220
2.8 unlocks nearly all marketplace items for free.

1860
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:07,460
And yeah, you can go check it out before it's taken down.

1861
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:09,780
All right.

1862
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,420
Dark Sakura.

1863
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:13,060
Samba de Amigo.

1864
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:19,060
Gosh, one of my favorite games, but Party Central is going to have some Sonic the Hedgehog

1865
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:21,700
content, including Sonic also playing.

1866
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:27,860
But for some of the songs, we have Escape from the City from Sonic Adventure 2 and Fistbump

1867
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:28,980
from Sonic Forces.

1868
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:34,500
And then there's a stage called City Escape as in the one from Sonic Adventure 2 with

1869
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,900
Sonic as a playable character.

1870
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:41,780
Although, why couldn't they have done like Speed Highway?

1871
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:43,620
That would have been so much better.

1872
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:49,700
If anyone who doesn't know what it is, City Escape is the one that's kind of like San

1873
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:54,260
Francisco, like almost a crazy taxi-ish kind of level.

1874
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:58,260
But yeah, it's going to be out for Switch this summer.

1875
01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:01,220
I don't see a date, but it'll be out.

1876
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:03,800
All right.

1877
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:10,900
Let's check out real quick some of the freebies coming to the extended platforms on PlayStation

1878
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,260
and Xbox.

1879
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:14,100
PlayStation Plus, the essentials.

1880
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:16,020
So what free games are you getting with that?

1881
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:16,980
Some interesting ones.

1882
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:20,580
Meet Your Maker is going to be the free game for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.

1883
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:22,980
This one's interesting because it's going to be a day one release.

1884
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:27,940
This is the new game from Behavior Entertainment, although I don't believe it's anything to

1885
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:29,140
do with horror or anything like that.

1886
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:32,900
It sounds more like a building fortress type of thing.

1887
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,580
It kind of is scary.

1888
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:35,220
Oh, interesting.

1889
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:35,720
Okay.

1890
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:42,920
So Meet Your Maker is you build different levels a la kind of Mario Maker, but there's

1891
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:44,600
death traps all the way through them.

1892
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:45,320
Oh, okay.

1893
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:45,960
Interesting.

1894
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:49,000
You have to get to the center, get something and get out.

1895
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,720
And every time it keeps track of your deaths as you go through it.

1896
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:54,920
It's not a bad game.

1897
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:55,800
I was in the beta.

1898
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,680
It wasn't my cup of tea, but it's a great game.

1899
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:04,600
Well, and the good news about it being on PlayStation Plus is that people will be able

1900
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:05,080
to grab it.

1901
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,800
And, you know, for better or for worse, I haven't played this game.

1902
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:12,600
I have no idea if it's good or not from my perspective, but I do know things like Rocket

1903
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:17,240
League have launched day one on PlayStation and been very, very successful as a result.

1904
01:49:17,240 --> 01:49:18,200
So we'll see what happens.

1905
01:49:19,720 --> 01:49:22,600
Also, other games for PlayStation.

1906
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:23,960
I'm very excited about this.

1907
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,560
Sackboy, A Big Adventure.

1908
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:29,480
That was one of the first titles on PlayStation 5, but it's also on PlayStation 4.

1909
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:34,680
That is, it's not LittleBigPlanet, but it's LittleBigPlanet's mascot in a somewhat LittleBigPlanet

1910
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:35,560
type of game.

1911
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,520
That is the best cosplay.

1912
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:38,840
Yes.

1913
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,680
And it just doesn't have the build your own stuff, but it looks like it'll be fun.

1914
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,800
And Tales of Iron is also going to be available.

1915
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:49,480
That is an RPG that it'll be available as well.

1916
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:52,040
That's all coming in April, starting April 4th.

1917
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:57,000
So on Tuesday, which a reminder, if you want to get the March games, which includes Minecraft

1918
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,920
Dungeons on PlayStation and some of the other releases, I forget what all was there.

1919
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:03,080
I think one of the Call of Duty games was this month.

1920
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,440
You can grab those before they're gone.

1921
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:09,880
Over on the Microsoft side of the house, two new games announced for April.

1922
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:12,200
I got to admit, these are more under the radar games.

1923
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:17,400
I'm not familiar with these like the other side, but we do have Out of Space Couch Edition

1924
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,520
will be available April 1st through April 30th.

1925
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:27,400
And Peaky Blinders Mastermind will be available from April 16th to May 15th because Microsoft

1926
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:30,040
does that interesting middle of the month switch that they do over there.

1927
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,520
So neither of these games are high dollar games.

1928
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:35,960
Out of Space is a $10 game.

1929
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,040
Peaky Blinders is a $25 game.

1930
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,720
So I will kind of point.

1931
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:42,600
Space sounds like it'd be like a hoarders game.

1932
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:43,320
Yeah, I don't know.

1933
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:43,720
I don't know.

1934
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,800
So, but again, I don't want to poop with these games just because they're lower studios.

1935
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:50,680
I haven't, sometimes those are the best games to come out on these things.

1936
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:55,320
So, but they're just, they're games I'm unaware of as of yet, but Xbox games with gold will

1937
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,720
give me the chance to grab them for free and try them out.

1938
01:50:58,600 --> 01:50:59,080
All right.

1939
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:03,080
Let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week that you

1940
01:51:03,080 --> 01:51:04,120
can pay full price for.

1941
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,040
Or maybe, maybe on sale.

1942
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:06,600
We'll see.

1943
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:07,560
Loki, how about the US?

1944
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:14,440
We have Grim Grimoire Once More on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1945
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:20,360
Meet Your Maker on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

1946
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:27,560
Road 96, Mile Zero on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

1947
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:28,440
Xbox Series.

1948
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:35,400
Curse of the Sea Rats on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and

1949
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:36,280
Xbox Series.

1950
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,640
Dungeons of Aether on Nintendo Switch.

1951
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:45,720
Everspace 2 on PC, Mac, and Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1952
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:53,560
Looks like Marfusha on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

1953
01:51:54,520 --> 01:52:03,320
Paparazzi on Nintendo Switch, EA Sports PGA Tour on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

1954
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:07,720
And then we'll also have, oh, that's it.

1955
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,600
Actually, that is it.

1956
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,200
All right.

1957
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:15,000
Traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases over there, we will start with the

1958
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:21,720
Nintendo Switch because we don't really do the Xbox releases in Japan for reasons that

1959
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:23,480
we've talked about earlier in the show.

1960
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:28,360
But we will mention some of the games that are releasing on the Switch on April the,

1961
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,840
actually, I don't think we have any releases in Japan this week.

1962
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,280
Wait, wait, wait.

1963
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,120
It's not, is it, hold on.

1964
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,200
Oh, it is April.

1965
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:42,840
It might be, yeah, because we don't have any big releases in Japan.

1966
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:43,720
Not even on the...

1967
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,920
Actually, Golden Week is April 29th.

1968
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,760
It is the end of the month.

1969
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:49,000
Yeah.

1970
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:49,800
Yeah.

1971
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:51,320
There is...

1972
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,720
But I knew Golden Week was around April.

1973
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:54,520
April-ish, yeah.

1974
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:56,280
Yeah.

1975
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:59,400
For whatever reason, it's a non-week week in Japan.

1976
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:01,400
There's really nothing releasing over there.

1977
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:02,760
There's like an AC adapter.

1978
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,720
You need a third party one of those.

1979
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:10,200
Everyone do extra work so that you can take the week off for Golden Week week.

1980
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,080
Yeah, I guess so.

1981
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,800
Nope, no releases this week.

1982
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:15,000
Okay.

1983
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,080
We do have stuff on the 13th, though, but that's next week.

1984
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:21,400
Well, in the UK, we have a handful of releases.

1985
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:25,320
On April 4th on Switch, we have Hello Neighbor 2.

1986
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:29,160
And on Switch also, we have the Hello Neighbor 2 Deluxe Edition.

1987
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:33,960
On PlayStation and Xbox, we have Firefighting Sim The Squad.

1988
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:38,360
On the 6th for PlayStation and Switch, we have Curse of the Sea Rats.

1989
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:45,000
Also on the 6th for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, Blade Assault.

1990
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:51,000
And on the 7th on PlayStation and Xbox, we have EA Sports PGA Tour.

1991
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:52,620
Yawn.

1992
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,400
I want them to have, though...

1993
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:59,480
Okay, you know what will make golf games interesting to me?

1994
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:02,520
Add Drunk Scotsman mode.

1995
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:06,840
Play the Kirby golf game.

1996
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,760
That would be my take.

1997
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:14,600
Go back and listen to Robin Williams describing the creation of golf.

1998
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:18,200
And then I want that to be the announcer in the game with lots

1999
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:21,000
of Drunk Scotsman, and that would make it an interesting game.

2000
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:24,280
I mean, we could do that now with AI.

2001
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:25,640
New dream game.

2002
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:30,680
I just realized I'm looking at the game playing behind Loki tonight,

2003
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:32,360
because I saw the whole isometric.

2004
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:34,120
I wasn't really paying attention to it until now.

2005
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,000
I saw the whole isometric.

2006
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,640
I was like, oh, is that Kirby's Dream Course?

2007
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:40,920
Oh, no, it's a Sonic Endless Runner of some sort.

2008
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:41,560
What is that?

2009
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:45,560
No, it's the Sonic Has Been Murdered game.

2010
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:47,400
Oh, and I haven't played it yet.

2011
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,120
Okay.

2012
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:48,520
Yeah.

2013
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:52,120
And wasn't that, like, the isometric mode from 3D Blast?

2014
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,440
Oh, I swear to kind of.

2015
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:57,400
It was that arcade game that I covered for Classic Game, like,

2016
01:54:57,400 --> 01:54:58,840
an age ago that was really weird.

2017
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:01,240
I looked at just the right time where I saw a minigame and not

2018
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:03,000
the actual murder part.

2019
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,500
Okay.

2020
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:04,680
All right.

2021
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,120
Please do not murder a Sonic.

2022
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:07,240
Okay, thanks, bye.

2023
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:10,280
Let's do a few more stories, and then we will invite your phone

2024
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,840
calls over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2025
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,840
But first, we have a few more stories.

2026
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,520
This one is fascinating to me.

2027
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,020
Loki?

2028
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:21,640
Yes, apparently the makers of Dolphin have announced that

2029
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:26,360
the GameCube and Wii emulator is coming to Steam early access

2030
01:55:26,360 --> 01:55:27,160
later this year.

2031
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:31,640
So the emulator obviously will be in there, but, you know,

2032
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,160
the ROMs will not.

2033
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:39,320
He said our great experiment, Dolphin is coming to Steam.

2034
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:42,280
We're pleased to finally tell the world of our experiment.

2035
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,640
This has been a product of many months of work, and we look

2036
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:48,760
forward to getting it into users' hands soon.

2037
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:51,000
It says while Dolphin's Steam page is already live, the

2038
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,320
emulator will be officially available through Valve's

2039
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:55,400
storefront until sometime in the next few months.

2040
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:59,800
It says the Dolphin emulator does not come with games.

2041
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:04,040
We do not condone piracy of any shape or form, and this

2042
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:07,080
software is built to run legally acquired games.

2043
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:10,520
I wonder how quickly it's going to be before Nintendo tries

2044
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,640
to take this down.

2045
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:13,640
Although I don't know if they really, I mean, maybe they

2046
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:17,960
can, as long as it's no part of their actual, like, no system

2047
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:19,720
bias or anything like that.

2048
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:21,480
I don't know.

2049
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:25,400
Yeah, I'm seriously curious about the legality of this.

2050
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:29,400
I also find this news was very oddly timed because this

2051
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:32,440
news came out literally a day after the 3DS and Wii U shops

2052
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:32,840
went down.

2053
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,760
And I know that this is about GameCube and Wii games, but

2054
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,560
there's a part of me that wonders, maybe the Wii U shop

2055
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:43,960
going down rendering Wii games unbuyable, if there's something

2056
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:45,320
going on with that.

2057
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:50,440
Technically, you can play like the WiiWare stuff, or I don't

2058
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:51,080
know what they call it.

2059
01:56:51,080 --> 01:56:54,280
I think it's the WiiWare through those emulators.

2060
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:57,080
So yeah, it'll be interesting.

2061
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:59,080
I mean, and to be fair, that's the only way you're going to

2062
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:04,120
be able to do things like Final Fantasy IV, the after years,

2063
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:06,360
the non-graphically enhanced versions.

2064
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,840
Some of those were that actually look like the old games.

2065
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:11,080
That was all on the WiiWare.

2066
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:12,920
So interesting.

2067
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:16,120
Interesting, interesting.

2068
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:17,560
Okay, moving on.

2069
01:57:17,560 --> 01:57:18,200
Dark Sakura.

2070
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:25,080
Well, something that we touched about was about Silent Hill 2

2071
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:27,160
remake being effectively done.

2072
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,160
And there was some clarification released on that.

2073
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:37,560
Bloober Team did address what was considered an accurate

2074
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,200
translation.

2075
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:43,640
They say it is not true that we announced Silent Hill 2 is

2076
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:44,440
ready for release.

2077
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:46,600
I am reading this from a quote.

2078
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:49,080
Regardless of the development stage, all of our activities

2079
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:52,200
are focused on obtaining the highest quality for the finished

2080
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:53,320
product.

2081
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:59,080
The quality of fans of Silent Hill 2

2082
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:00,200
deserve.

2083
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:03,480
The statement refers to sales forecasts, which were referenced

2084
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,200
in the article.

2085
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:09,480
And the studio's previous games reached a sales ceiling of

2086
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:12,680
2 million copies, but they were aiming for 10 million.

2087
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:17,320
So right now, then they were basically more talking about

2088
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:20,280
forecast and not about the actual game being done.

2089
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:28,120
So, but their end quote on this is saying that we are aware

2090
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,680
that players are waiting for more information about Silent

2091
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:31,560
Hill 2.

2092
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:34,200
As soon as such information becomes available, we are sure

2093
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,840
that Konami, the publisher of the game, will share it with

2094
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:37,240
fans.

2095
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:39,560
So that's it.

2096
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:44,600
And honestly, with the whole, like, summer fest stuff seems

2097
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:47,640
like a good time to give more information about that type

2098
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:48,440
of stuff.

2099
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:51,160
You know, just it's only a couple months away.

2100
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:51,960
Hang on, people.

2101
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:53,000
Hang on.

2102
01:58:53,960 --> 01:58:54,920
Keep your pants on.

2103
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:56,520
Actually, don't.

2104
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:57,160
Take them off.

2105
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:57,720
We will see.

2106
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,400
All right.

2107
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:00,920
Pants off, pants off.

2108
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:02,520
Who's saying I'm wearing them now?

2109
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:03,020
All right.

2110
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,760
Moving on.

2111
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:05,320
Loki.

2112
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:07,240
It's not so great news.

2113
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:10,120
All too familiar news this year.

2114
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:12,600
As we know, it's the end of the financial year.

2115
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:15,320
So what's that mean when we're a successful company like

2116
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:16,200
Electronic Arts?

2117
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,240
Yes, layoffs.

2118
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:17,880
That's right.

2119
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:21,080
Because, you know, that's what they do.

2120
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:25,800
So they generate approximately $7 billion in that revenue

2121
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:29,320
last year, and now they've laid off 6% of its global

2122
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,400
workforce, 7 to 800 people.

2123
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:37,960
And while they drive greater focus across our portfolios,

2124
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:42,120
they're moving away from projects that do not contribute

2125
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:46,040
to their strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint

2126
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:47,880
and restructuring some of our teams.

2127
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:53,240
So yeah, cool.

2128
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:55,560
But not really.

2129
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:59,160
Not cool, but yeah, it's just not surprised.

2130
01:59:59,160 --> 01:59:59,560
Yeah.

2131
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:01,400
And EA had a pretty good year, didn't they?

2132
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:02,840
Yeah.

2133
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:03,480
Seven.

2134
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:05,800
I mean, I would think, you know, if you made $7 billion.

2135
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,040
Look, I get the whole and we've gone down this road before

2136
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:12,680
and about how layoffs are supposed to be about what's

2137
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:16,280
coming and not what's already happened, but it's still not

2138
02:00:16,280 --> 02:00:16,840
a good look.

2139
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:21,160
Like, and this all falls back to a theme we've talked about

2140
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:24,120
many times on the show, and that is perception.

2141
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:27,720
That's the truth, especially in the gaming industry for

2142
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:28,600
a lot of people.

2143
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:31,320
And when you have a great year and then you lay off 800

2144
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:35,720
people at the end of that year, it's perceived a certain

2145
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:37,080
way, whether it's true or not.

2146
02:00:37,080 --> 02:00:38,200
And it doesn't read great.

2147
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:39,160
Yeah.

2148
02:00:39,160 --> 02:00:41,400
Perception versus intention.

2149
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:41,900
Yep.

2150
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:44,200
Yeah.

2151
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:44,700
Yeah.

2152
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:50,440
It should just be the law or something that if a company

2153
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:53,880
loses the money, it comes out of the upper management pay.

2154
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:58,840
Or that a certain percentage of cuts come from upper management

2155
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:01,320
as well, but that'll never happen.

2156
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:06,040
Sadly, Prince Peach Fuzz says layoffs or cut management

2157
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:07,880
bonuses. Exactly.

2158
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:08,520
That part.

2159
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:09,080
Exactly.

2160
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,680
Fixation Gay says, especially since they are making Sims

2161
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:14,040
five, this sucks.

2162
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:17,000
Yeah, there's still a lot of things EA still working on

2163
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,440
that we expect will do fine.

2164
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,720
Well, and on top of that, I mean, how much revenue are

2165
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:24,440
they pulling from the 50,000 Sims 4?

2166
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:26,920
Literally, literally.

2167
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:29,400
All right.

2168
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:32,040
I mean, there's a reason why I practically lived on the

2169
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:35,160
Sims resource so I could get cool stuff.

2170
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:39,320
Mike Deft says it very succinctly in our chat.

2171
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,760
Unionize.

2172
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:41,980
Yes.

2173
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:44,120
Unionize game industry.

2174
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,200
A few of you already have.

2175
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:47,240
Learn from your peers.

2176
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,280
That tide is coming.

2177
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:49,160
That tide is coming.

2178
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:50,600
All right.

2179
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:53,640
Well, a game that I wish EA wishes they made, but unfortunately

2180
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:54,120
they didn't.

2181
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:57,720
It was publisher Rogue Games and developer Dabado Games is

2182
02:01:57,720 --> 02:01:58,600
releasing.

2183
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:01,720
Hey, look, you know we love our rhythm games here on Orange

2184
02:02:01,720 --> 02:02:02,360
Lawns Radio.

2185
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:04,680
We are rooted in rhythm game history.

2186
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:06,200
Dark Soccer, Loki, myself.

2187
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:08,120
We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution.

2188
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:11,160
We'd love to play Para Para, BeatMania 2DX.

2189
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:14,760
Hell, we were even on the news about Guitar Hero one time.

2190
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,200
We love music games.

2191
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:17,240
On my house.

2192
02:02:17,240 --> 02:02:20,520
And that's why we have to close the show tonight before we

2193
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:21,160
get to your calls.

2194
02:02:21,160 --> 02:02:25,640
Anyway, talking about Hello Kitty and Friends Happiness

2195
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,120
Parade.

2196
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:30,040
It's coming out on the Switch, and it'll be out April 13th

2197
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:31,400
for $19.99.

2198
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,760
But 15% discount if you get it in the first week, because

2199
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,520
that's when they want to sell it.

2200
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:38,760
By the way, not just on the Switch and the eShop, but if

2201
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:39,560
you want.

2202
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:43,960
I'm sorry, this actually already launched for iOS and Android,

2203
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:46,440
and it was also a Netflix exclusive thing.

2204
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:49,880
My phone is my webcam, and I can't get it right now.

2205
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,960
Launched in November, but now it's the Switch version that's

2206
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:54,440
coming out.

2207
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,760
If you want to know more about it, get ready for a fun and

2208
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:01,640
unexpected journey through the world of Sanrio in a music

2209
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:03,880
rhythm game like nothing you've experienced before.

2210
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:07,720
Join Hello Kitty and two friends on a delightful music tour

2211
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:09,880
as they spread happiness to everyone.

2212
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:12,200
Along the way, they'll discover new friends to join their

2213
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:13,400
musical parades.

2214
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:17,240
However, jealous of Hello Kitty's growing fan base, Kuromi

2215
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:20,520
will stop at nothing to end the music, dispatching goons and

2216
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:22,680
laying traps to stop the momentum.

2217
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:25,720
It's up to you to dance, dance, dance to the beat, avoid

2218
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:29,160
traps, use each character's unique abilities, collect coins

2219
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:31,400
and upgrades, complete challenges, and bring joy to the

2220
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,680
world around you.

2221
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:36,440
With a robust soundtrack filled with over 40 amazing pop

2222
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:36,840
hits.

2223
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,360
I wonder what those hits are, but they're probably Japanese

2224
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:40,600
hits.

2225
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:42,680
They all sound like they're in Japanese.

2226
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:45,080
You'll be dancing to the music long after you put the

2227
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,360
controllers down.

2228
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:48,520
So it actually looks, it's interesting because it looks

2229
02:03:48,520 --> 02:03:50,520
like it might be like a little bit of like a runner kind

2230
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:51,400
of game.

2231
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:54,360
But like, I'm trying to, let me try to show this on the other

2232
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:55,880
screen here as I'm doing this live.

2233
02:03:57,320 --> 02:04:00,760
Watching the trailer and it's very derivative, but the layout

2234
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:02,200
is what's unique, I think.

2235
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:02,700
Yeah.

2236
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,600
So I'm trying to feel like how this kind of plays.

2237
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,160
It's kind of hard to tell from the screenshots, but it kind

2238
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,000
of looks like you're going down a track sort of thing.

2239
02:04:11,880 --> 02:04:12,600
Oh, hold on.

2240
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:16,120
All I know is that you can play Bad Batsumaru, and that's

2241
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:17,160
the most important part.

2242
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:18,440
And he's huge.

2243
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,080
He is.

2244
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:21,080
That's as he needs to be.

2245
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:22,360
Here's the character select screen.

2246
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:23,080
There it is.

2247
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:24,920
Because I know you all want to know what characters are in

2248
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:25,000
it.

2249
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:25,640
So there you go.

2250
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:28,760
That may not be all of them.

2251
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:33,480
Oh, you actually, you're on the, I found this elsewhere,

2252
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:36,040
but no, that's just the same link we had.

2253
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:36,600
Nevermind.

2254
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:36,920
Sorry.

2255
02:04:36,920 --> 02:04:38,280
Was there a trailer embedded?

2256
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:39,720
There's a trailer on the page.

2257
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:40,840
Oh, there sure is.

2258
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:41,960
From another source.

2259
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:44,840
And apparently I think it was the same one.

2260
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:45,000
Yeah.

2261
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,480
Oh, okay.

2262
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:48,440
So it kind of looks like you move around to the beat sort

2263
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:49,000
of thing.

2264
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:49,500
Okay.

2265
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:53,240
Like an audio surf kind of thing or something like that.

2266
02:04:53,240 --> 02:04:55,160
Oh, you have to dance around the spike box.

2267
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:55,480
Okay.

2268
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:57,720
They show like this photo mode thing where I guess you get

2269
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:59,720
like a special, it was on this one.

2270
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:00,220
Yeah.

2271
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:02,440
I thought pretty cool.

2272
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:02,760
Okay.

2273
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,840
So what's going on?

2274
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:07,640
You have like a twisting path with people on either side of

2275
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:07,800
it.

2276
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:10,920
It has three segments on each path with coins on them.

2277
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:14,440
And so I reckon that you have to be on the path to collect

2278
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:15,960
the coins as it goes.

2279
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:21,080
At different intervals, there is a, like a, I guess a checkpoint

2280
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,440
line, like in a race.

2281
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,080
And at that point, if you pass the photo shoot one, you get

2282
02:05:27,080 --> 02:05:29,320
like a special mode where it focuses in on your character

2283
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:32,440
with lights and animations and whatnot.

2284
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:36,280
So for people who are not watching.

2285
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:37,480
Thank you.

2286
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:39,080
Yes.

2287
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:39,580
All right.

2288
02:05:42,520 --> 02:05:43,640
Comments in chat.

2289
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:46,360
Mike Def says, so it's a runner rhythm game with Hello Kitty

2290
02:05:46,360 --> 02:05:46,840
and friends.

2291
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:47,400
Sign me up.

2292
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:47,640
Yeah.

2293
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,200
Hey, 20 bucks or apparently Netflix.

2294
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:51,800
It might be free on the phones.

2295
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:55,880
So bonds 006 says I may just try that Hello Kitty game for

2296
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:56,520
research.

2297
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:59,320
Hey, look, all these years later, we still want to bring you

2298
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,920
the latest and greatest in music gaming.

2299
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:01,560
So there you go.

2300
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:03,000
Hey, Rob.

2301
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:03,480
What?

2302
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:05,000
I just had a flash of memory.

2303
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:05,500
Okay.

2304
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:10,780
You and me in Burlingame at what was it called?

2305
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:11,500
Network video.

2306
02:06:12,620 --> 02:06:13,500
Oh, Jesus.

2307
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:13,740
Okay.

2308
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:14,940
This would have been a long time ago.

2309
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:19,660
And you bought a game that I found and passed on to you

2310
02:06:19,660 --> 02:06:20,780
called Kitty the cool.

2311
02:06:21,580 --> 02:06:23,100
Oh, my God.

2312
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:23,340
Yeah.

2313
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:23,580
Yeah.

2314
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:24,300
Yeah.

2315
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:25,740
And you know what I bought that day?

2316
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:27,580
Vib ribbon.

2317
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:27,980
Yeah.

2318
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:28,940
I remember Vib ribbon.

2319
02:06:29,980 --> 02:06:30,300
Yep.

2320
02:06:30,940 --> 02:06:31,820
Oh, what a day.

2321
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:32,460
Good times.

2322
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:33,580
Yeah.

2323
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:36,140
I just had a very vivid memory of it all of a sudden.

2324
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:36,380
No.

2325
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:36,780
All good.

2326
02:06:36,780 --> 02:06:37,260
I love it.

2327
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:37,820
All right.

2328
02:06:37,820 --> 02:06:39,180
RIP network video.

2329
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:41,420
We're going to get to some calls.

2330
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:45,740
We invite your calls through our Discord server, vognetwork.com

2331
02:06:45,740 --> 02:06:46,380
slash discord.

2332
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:46,700
You know what?

2333
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:48,540
Even if you don't want to call, you just want to hang out

2334
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:49,660
with us throughout the week.

2335
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:52,460
We get a lot of stories that get posted the OLR channel.

2336
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:56,460
You get to see me make fun of tweets and say a lot of things

2337
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,180
throughout the week.

2338
02:06:57,180 --> 02:07:00,860
So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

2339
02:07:00,860 --> 02:07:02,700
We do have a call waiting in the green room.

2340
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:04,540
If you want to call into the show, the green room is the

2341
02:07:04,540 --> 02:07:07,500
place to go because you can't actually see Archa through

2342
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:08,940
the magical mystery of Discord.

2343
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:11,660
You can't actually see our room where we're recording now,

2344
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:14,540
but that for obvious Twitch related security purposes,

2345
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:15,180
we don't.

2346
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:17,900
We're not a wide open room, but we'll pull you in from the

2347
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:21,260
green room if we see you in there, such as this caller,

2348
02:07:21,260 --> 02:07:22,380
who we've heard from before.

2349
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:24,060
And I'm excited to welcome back.

2350
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:25,820
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2351
02:07:25,820 --> 02:07:26,220
Who's this?

2352
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:28,460
This is ActDeft.

2353
02:07:28,460 --> 02:07:29,340
Hey, ActDeft.

2354
02:07:29,340 --> 02:07:30,860
It is great to hear from you.

2355
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:31,500
What's up, buddy?

2356
02:07:32,700 --> 02:07:38,060
Well, do you want to write more about Niantic?

2357
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:40,140
Do I have a choice?

2358
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:42,540
We do.

2359
02:07:42,540 --> 02:07:44,620
But yeah, I want to talk about that.

2360
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:49,260
I want to pretty much stay my opinion on that because,

2361
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:54,060
you know, and everyone knows I'm an avid Pokemon Go player.

2362
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:55,020
Yes, you are.

2363
02:07:55,020 --> 02:08:00,540
And yeah, I'm definitely not happy with how Niantic has handled

2364
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:06,300
things in the past year, probably even.

2365
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:12,300
But this is probably, yeah, one of the worst decisions they

2366
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:17,740
have made because, and yeah, it's the remote raid thing.

2367
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:21,900
It's like, I know that not many people that, okay, I'm going

2368
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:26,620
to rave and I'm going to use those passes like a lot.

2369
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:31,500
But at the same time, and I've seen it because I know people

2370
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:35,980
that are disabled or have a condition and cannot go outside

2371
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:42,060
like easily or have access to those places and they have

2372
02:08:42,060 --> 02:08:44,060
to rely on those remote raids.

2373
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:49,180
So it actually makes me angry for them because Niantic knows

2374
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,540
this. They know.

2375
02:08:51,260 --> 02:08:55,340
They have less than according to them.

2376
02:08:56,140 --> 02:09:00,620
And it's like baffling that they keep making these decisions

2377
02:09:00,620 --> 02:09:05,660
without considering what is happening to the player base.

2378
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:12,300
And I've heard this from other podcasts, other people, that

2379
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:17,740
they should be rewarding people that are going out and playing

2380
02:09:17,740 --> 02:09:21,900
incentivizing to go out instead of punishing players that

2381
02:09:22,700 --> 02:09:25,500
cannot go out, that cannot play outside.

2382
02:09:26,220 --> 02:09:32,300
I know that the thing you have to do in Pokemon Go is go out,

2383
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:35,500
catch them all, play, meet people and all that.

2384
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:38,140
And I understand that I actually enjoy that part of the

2385
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:42,540
game, but at the same time, it's like not everyone can do it.

2386
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:44,620
And we should have the option.

2387
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:53,260
We should have more of, okay, like something like the incense

2388
02:09:54,220 --> 02:09:58,940
that also like costs a lot of outrage.

2389
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:03,820
You know, during the pandemic, we had the one minute instance,

2390
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:07,020
like every minute you had to spawn for one hour.

2391
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:09,580
And okay, that was really great.

2392
02:10:09,580 --> 02:10:10,780
It was a good change.

2393
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:14,300
And they change it back to five minutes.

2394
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:18,620
If you're stationary, if you're walking, if you're moving

2395
02:10:18,620 --> 02:10:23,500
fast enough, you get the one minute spawn, but they could

2396
02:10:23,500 --> 02:10:27,100
have changed that like they did with the daily incense.

2397
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:31,740
Like, okay, if you go out, if you're moving, if we see you're

2398
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:35,820
moving, you get better spawns, you get legendaries, you get

2399
02:10:37,340 --> 02:10:41,020
like see the legendaries, you get more good stuff.

2400
02:10:41,260 --> 02:10:44,220
But if you're stationary, okay, you get the regular spawns,

2401
02:10:44,220 --> 02:10:48,380
you get normal stuff, you get normal like by going out.

2402
02:10:49,340 --> 02:10:53,180
But I also want to clarify, Deft, I agree with you totally

2403
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:54,140
on what you're saying.

2404
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:57,180
One thing that was interesting about that daily adventure

2405
02:10:57,180 --> 02:11:00,940
incense is that they, and again, it's a key problem with

2406
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:03,980
with the whole messaging this time, that daily adventure

2407
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:08,300
incense came out after the bad news announcement.

2408
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:10,220
And it was one of those things where I was like, you know,

2409
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:12,380
maybe if they'd said this when they've done the other that

2410
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:14,460
they're going to give you a free 50 minute incense every

2411
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:17,100
day, maybe it would have lessened the blow a little bit

2412
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:18,860
and that and I feel like it's the mistake they're making

2413
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:19,260
here.

2414
02:11:19,260 --> 02:11:21,180
But one other thing I want to say with the remote raids,

2415
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:22,220
because I think this is important.

2416
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:23,180
I didn't say it earlier.

2417
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:26,700
I've always felt those remote raids were pretty bullshit.

2418
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:28,140
And I'm going to tell you why.

2419
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:29,580
And it's not what you think.

2420
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:34,300
It's because you're not guaranteed to get that Pokemon.

2421
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:38,140
So you're jacking up the price from 100 to 195.

2422
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:42,300
And I'm not even guaranteed to get the Pokemon at the end

2423
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:42,700
of the day.

2424
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:45,180
I mean, what a joke.

2425
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:50,300
At least the ones in person, you get a free pass every day.

2426
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:51,580
So, okay, I use my pass.

2427
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:52,620
I didn't get it today.

2428
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:54,380
All right, whatever, whatever it worked out.

2429
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:56,220
I would say from the get go.

2430
02:11:56,940 --> 02:11:58,780
And I think part of this kind of plays into some of the

2431
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:00,460
things I was saying earlier that may not have been as

2432
02:12:00,460 --> 02:12:00,860
popular.

2433
02:12:00,860 --> 02:12:04,460
But from my perspective, the remote raids have never been

2434
02:12:04,460 --> 02:12:08,940
an equal playing field to what's going on out what's

2435
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:10,060
happening in the real world.

2436
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:12,380
It's bullshit that it's not a guaranteed chance if you're

2437
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,500
going to spend that kind of money.

2438
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,180
It's gambling.

2439
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:16,780
It's mature rated in Australia.

2440
02:12:17,900 --> 02:12:22,940
And even then, it's like, okay, the good news they gave us

2441
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:25,900
for going like in person raids.

2442
02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:28,140
Oh, you're going to get XL candy.

2443
02:12:28,140 --> 02:12:29,420
You're going to get more XL candy.

2444
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:30,140
Yeah.

2445
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:33,500
It's like, yeah, we already have the bonus active.

2446
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:37,020
It's something that should be happening already.

2447
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:40,780
Like, okay, if you're going to give us like those XL candies

2448
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:43,580
that are really valuable in the game, okay, then make

2449
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:48,780
probably, okay, more XP bonuses, more stardust bonuses,

2450
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:51,980
give us more incentive to go out and play.

2451
02:12:52,780 --> 02:12:56,620
Because on the other hand, and I said this on Twitter, it's

2452
02:12:56,620 --> 02:13:00,060
like, I barely raid right now.

2453
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:03,340
It's like, I barely do raids because I don't have the time

2454
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:04,460
to do them.

2455
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:08,140
It's like, if someone invites me, I'll probably do it.

2456
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:11,340
And because it's something I really want, or I'm grinding

2457
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,900
for a certain Pokemon.

2458
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:16,940
But right now, it's like, why even bother?

2459
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:19,340
Yeah, I stopped buying the passes.

2460
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:20,700
So I feel bad when I get the invites.

2461
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:23,020
I never go in, but I stopped buying the passes.

2462
02:13:23,980 --> 02:13:27,900
I only buy passes if I have the coins for it because I leave

2463
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:28,940
my Pokemon in gyms.

2464
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:30,460
Sure, that's it.

2465
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:30,860
Sure.

2466
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:31,340
And that's it.

2467
02:13:31,340 --> 02:13:32,780
I had to buy storage and stuff.

2468
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:35,340
And I've been trying not to throw Niantic money.

2469
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,980
So I've been just kind of in that game anyway.

2470
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:40,060
I've just been stockpiling my gym coins.

2471
02:13:40,060 --> 02:13:41,260
Yeah, same thing, basically.

2472
02:13:41,260 --> 02:13:43,340
But I'm not really buying remote raid passes because I've

2473
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:44,540
just had one too many raids.

2474
02:13:44,540 --> 02:13:48,220
It's interesting because the raids I'm okay with remote

2475
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,860
raiding are the mega evolution ones, because you're always

2476
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:53,740
guaranteed to get mega evolution juice, even if you don't

2477
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:54,540
catch the Pokemon.

2478
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:57,660
It's weird because I think the mega evolutions of Pokemon

2479
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:58,380
Go are silly.

2480
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:00,780
I don't really care for them, but it's actually the best

2481
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:03,420
better rating mechanic are those mega evolution raids,

2482
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:05,260
because you're always guaranteed at least something.

2483
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:10,140
Yeah, at least there's something desirable outside of XP

2484
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:10,860
and Stardust.

2485
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:12,460
You know, people are going to say, well, you get those.

2486
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,780
It's not the same and you know it.

2487
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:18,460
Yeah, it's not the same, but at least there's something

2488
02:14:18,460 --> 02:14:19,660
always worth it.

2489
02:14:20,220 --> 02:14:22,780
Like, even with legendary raids and other raids, it's like,

2490
02:14:22,780 --> 02:14:24,860
okay, you get the chance for a shiny.

2491
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:28,620
You get the chance for if you're living up, you want to

2492
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:29,180
Stardust.

2493
02:14:29,180 --> 02:14:32,700
It's like, okay, you do them because, okay, it's fun sometimes.

2494
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:36,860
But again, in this case, it's like, why even bother?

2495
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:40,220
It's like, why should I even go out and raid?

2496
02:14:40,220 --> 02:14:42,300
Because there's no incentive to do so.

2497
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:42,860
Right.

2498
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:47,020
And even like with remote raiding, it's like, I mostly do it

2499
02:14:47,020 --> 02:14:49,020
because, oh, I'm helping someone else.

2500
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:55,100
And even like today, I had the problem with a Pokemon

2501
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:59,820
girlfriend that he needed people to beat out a Loye.

2502
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:00,940
That's the legendary right now.

2503
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:05,420
And we couldn't do the raid because there wasn't enough

2504
02:15:05,420 --> 02:15:05,740
people.

2505
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:12,300
So right now, even like now, people are not even like

2506
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:16,060
actively going out for raiding or doing raids in that way

2507
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:19,900
because it's also kind of expensive, like buying every

2508
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:24,140
single time, like a 100 coin pass.

2509
02:15:25,340 --> 02:15:30,380
It's like, even then, it's like, wow, it's dumb.

2510
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:34,540
And it's one of the many dumb decisions Niantic has done

2511
02:15:34,540 --> 02:15:37,260
again in the past few years, in the last year, at least.

2512
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:40,060
And this is where it's starting to get annoying is that

2513
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:42,300
this is at least the third time, at least the third time

2514
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:44,940
now they've made a major game decision that seems completely

2515
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:48,140
tone deaf to the community and especially the ways they're

2516
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:48,940
announcing it and everything.

2517
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:51,420
It's hard to watch.

2518
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:54,220
It's getting to be very hard to watch that they can be this

2519
02:15:56,060 --> 02:16:01,260
unwilling to change their ways and like not listen to advice

2520
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:01,980
yet again.

2521
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:04,860
But anyway, I think the remote raids were kind of busted

2522
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:07,020
from the start, to be quite honest, but I get it.

2523
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:09,980
And I'll keep playing.

2524
02:16:09,980 --> 02:16:12,620
I enjoy Pokemon Go for what it is.

2525
02:16:13,340 --> 02:16:14,860
I enjoy going out playing.

2526
02:16:15,020 --> 02:16:19,900
I have friends that have recently either come back to play

2527
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:21,980
or are new to the game.

2528
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:26,220
So it's like, oh, I have someone to play with.

2529
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:30,700
At least if I go out, I can tell them and we can go there.

2530
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:31,740
We can go to a park.

2531
02:16:31,740 --> 02:16:33,580
We can go to this or that.

2532
02:16:34,140 --> 02:16:38,300
So it's like that part is still fun, but it's part of what

2533
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:39,340
the game already was.

2534
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:43,660
So again, I'm not going to uninstall the game or anything.

2535
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:47,660
People are saying that you should probably turn off

2536
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:51,580
Adventure Sync because that's another way they're generating

2537
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:55,180
or getting your info of location.

2538
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:55,980
Interesting.

2539
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:59,900
If you're like that extreme, it's like, oh, I'm not going

2540
02:16:59,900 --> 02:17:03,660
to uninstall the game, but I don't want to get Niantic any

2541
02:17:03,660 --> 02:17:07,820
money or any more money, turn off Adventure Sync.

2542
02:17:07,820 --> 02:17:09,900
You know what another thing it can do?

2543
02:17:10,460 --> 02:17:12,140
And I don't think I've seen a lot of people talking about

2544
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:13,740
this, probably because nobody's doing it anyway.

2545
02:17:13,740 --> 02:17:16,140
But here, 100%, if you really want to get Niantic,

2546
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:18,860
don't scan Poke Stops, period.

2547
02:17:19,420 --> 02:17:22,860
Do not, under any circumstance, for any reward, scan

2548
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,060
Poke Stops.

2549
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:26,380
That is the data they really want.

2550
02:17:26,380 --> 02:17:28,540
And that's where they're trying to push.

2551
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:31,100
They even announced for Ingress 3D glyph hacking.

2552
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:32,860
I think it was something they talked about

2553
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:33,500
Stop by Southwest.

2554
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:35,260
So we're going to start to see the features from that.

2555
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:37,180
But in order for them to roll out those features, they

2556
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:39,900
have to have the data around Poke Stops.

2557
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:44,700
So that is honestly the number one thing you could do if

2558
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:46,380
you really want to stick it to Niantic.

2559
02:17:46,380 --> 02:17:49,820
Do not, under any circumstance, scan Poke Stops.

2560
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:53,580
Basically, don't give them any info they want.

2561
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:56,940
That's the whole summary of it.

2562
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:58,860
But yeah, I'm going to keep playing.

2563
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:01,820
But yeah, I'm not going to invest any more money in the

2564
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:06,220
game unless they make some changes in the future or as soon

2565
02:18:06,220 --> 02:18:09,340
as possible to make the game better for everyone.

2566
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:11,100
I want to ask you one more thing.

2567
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:12,620
We have a caller waiting, so I want to get to them too.

2568
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:14,460
But one more quick question before I let you go.

2569
02:18:15,180 --> 02:18:17,260
What do you think of this whole latest kind of like

2570
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:21,740
conspiracy theory, if you will, that Niantic never intended

2571
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:25,980
to set the price at $195, because apparently it was

2572
02:18:25,980 --> 02:18:28,700
data mined some time ago that the price of remote passes

2573
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:29,980
was going to be $150.

2574
02:18:30,620 --> 02:18:33,580
So Niantic, what they're doing here, and this is again,

2575
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:36,700
nobody knows this for sure, but this is what some tinfoil

2576
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:39,980
hat folks on social media and YouTube channels especially

2577
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:43,820
are saying is that Niantic never intended, intends to go

2578
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:45,100
to $195.

2579
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:47,580
They're going to make it look like, oh, we're listening to

2580
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:49,980
the community and so we're going to bring it back.

2581
02:18:49,980 --> 02:18:54,700
We're going to compromise and set it to $150 when it was

2582
02:18:54,700 --> 02:18:56,300
always intended to be $150.

2583
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:56,700
Gotcha.

2584
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:03,740
Um, I can't believe the conspiracy theory there, but at

2585
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:09,100
the same time, since we have like, we have gotten leaks

2586
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:12,620
from Pokemon Go in the sense that they haven't released

2587
02:19:12,620 --> 02:19:13,180
something yet.

2588
02:19:13,180 --> 02:19:19,020
And I can speak like in terms of Scarlet and Violet, we

2589
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:21,900
learned about Gimmigo before the game even launched.

2590
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:22,780
True.

2591
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:26,060
So it's like, maybe it's something, okay, they are listening

2592
02:19:26,060 --> 02:19:28,300
and they're going to revert, but they haven't gone into,

2593
02:19:29,020 --> 02:19:31,020
to, okay, we're going to make this change this way.

2594
02:19:31,740 --> 02:19:34,620
But at the same time, and this is something I also want

2595
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:40,140
to say on record, that the price increase for me isn't

2596
02:19:40,140 --> 02:19:41,020
the deal breaker.

2597
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:43,900
They could have increased the price, whatever.

2598
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:48,300
It's the thing that they're limiting the rates for only

2599
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:48,860
five a day.

2600
02:19:51,020 --> 02:19:54,620
That's the thing that's getting to me that it's like,

2601
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:55,420
why are you limited?

2602
02:19:56,140 --> 02:19:59,420
Like, it's like, again, not all people that are remote

2603
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:03,820
rating are going to spend like, oh, I'm going to buy 10

2604
02:20:03,820 --> 02:20:06,220
passes or I'm going to buy 20.

2605
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:09,500
Most people that do that are probably most of the people

2606
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,340
that are going to go out and rate it anyways.

2607
02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:16,140
And I know them because I watch also those Poketubers too.

2608
02:20:16,860 --> 02:20:18,620
And I know people that do that.

2609
02:20:18,620 --> 02:20:20,700
It's like, yeah, they're going to do it anyway.

2610
02:20:20,700 --> 02:20:21,980
They're going to buy the passes.

2611
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:25,980
It's the thing that they're limiting to people that are

2612
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:28,140
probably, again, that cannot probably go out.

2613
02:20:28,780 --> 02:20:29,500
They cannot move.

2614
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:33,900
They cannot access certain places that it's like, why?

2615
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:35,260
Why limit that?

2616
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:38,860
Why nerf the passes in that way?

2617
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:40,780
Yeah, it does seem odd.

2618
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:44,300
I don't know anyone that rates that much remotely anyway,

2619
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:47,340
but I'm sure they must have the data for it, I guess.

2620
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:48,220
But anyway.

2621
02:20:48,220 --> 02:20:50,380
All right, I'm going to let you go, my friend.

2622
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:51,660
Thank you so much for the phone call.

2623
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:54,380
And we'll see what kind of meetings happen this weekend

2624
02:20:54,380 --> 02:20:57,980
when Niantic says tomorrow and maybe Tuesday.

2625
02:20:57,980 --> 02:20:58,780
So we'll see.

2626
02:20:58,780 --> 02:20:59,100
Yeah.

2627
02:20:59,100 --> 02:20:59,340
All right.

2628
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:00,540
Take care, my friend.

2629
02:21:00,540 --> 02:21:01,420
Hey, thanks for having me.

2630
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:02,060
Thank you.

2631
02:21:02,060 --> 02:21:02,460
Take care.

2632
02:21:02,460 --> 02:21:02,860
Bye bye.

2633
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:03,980
All right.

2634
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:06,940
We're going to hop on actually to one more quick call here.

2635
02:21:06,940 --> 02:21:09,980
Let me just change the cameras around live and let's welcome

2636
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:11,020
another caller.

2637
02:21:11,020 --> 02:21:12,620
Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2638
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:13,020
Who's this?

2639
02:21:14,140 --> 02:21:15,900
Hi, my name is Fixation Gaze.

2640
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:16,300
Hello.

2641
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:17,340
Well, I remember you.

2642
02:21:17,340 --> 02:21:19,580
You were here last week, but it's great to hear from you.

2643
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:20,140
How are you?

2644
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:22,540
Oh, I'm great.

2645
02:21:22,540 --> 02:21:26,860
I just was I because you were talking about EA and Sims was

2646
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:29,020
one of my hyper fixations like Resident Evil.

2647
02:21:29,020 --> 02:21:31,900
You uncracked my autistic Uber potential.

2648
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:34,860
And now I'm here to rant about how mad I am at EA about Sims.

2649
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:36,140
Well, please let's talk.

2650
02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:39,660
Let's talk about how mad you are at EA.

2651
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:41,500
That was one of my fixations, too.

2652
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:43,180
So yeah, I feel you.

2653
02:21:43,180 --> 02:21:44,780
I spent last summer.

2654
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:49,500
I think I have over 2000 hours in Sims 4 on its own.

2655
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:50,140
Oh, my gosh.

2656
02:21:50,140 --> 02:21:51,260
I was a Sims kid, too.

2657
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:54,380
I spent years on that stupid game.

2658
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:56,140
But I wanted to say, fun fact.

2659
02:21:56,140 --> 02:21:58,940
Do you know how much it costs to get every single add on for

2660
02:21:58,940 --> 02:21:59,500
the Sims?

2661
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:02,780
Bob Parker number.

2662
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:03,820
1500.

2663
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:04,780
I'd go higher.

2664
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:06,940
I'll say 4300.

2665
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:09,820
You both actually were incorrect.

2666
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:10,860
It is much lower than that.

2667
02:22:10,860 --> 02:22:14,060
It is currently $995.

2668
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:15,340
That's cheap.

2669
02:22:15,340 --> 02:22:16,220
Gwen, I'm closer.

2670
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:19,820
What price is right rules we both lost.

2671
02:22:19,820 --> 02:22:23,900
But going back to what Gwen was saying about mortgage payments,

2672
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:25,900
that's two thirds of mine.

2673
02:22:26,540 --> 02:22:27,100
Yeah.

2674
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:31,180
But to be fair, that doesn't sound a lot for, like, if you

2675
02:22:31,180 --> 02:22:34,620
think about loot boxes and whatnot and buying add ons.

2676
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:39,180
But that in totals to 61 add ons for the game.

2677
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:39,980
61.

2678
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:42,540
Instead of updating your game.

2679
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:46,220
Instead, every single one of those add ons is some sort of

2680
02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:47,180
just penny pinching.

2681
02:22:47,180 --> 02:22:49,260
Like, oh, we made this functional.

2682
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:50,140
Buy it.

2683
02:22:50,140 --> 02:22:53,260
Which is actually one of the game packs because they have

2684
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:53,980
four different packs.

2685
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:55,100
They have expansions.

2686
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:55,980
They have game packs.

2687
02:22:56,860 --> 02:22:57,580
And they have kits.

2688
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:02,220
So again, instead of balling them up into here's expansion

2689
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:05,660
pack one, two, three, and four, they have different gimmicks.

2690
02:23:05,660 --> 02:23:08,540
Like, one of them in the game packs, which runs for about

2691
02:23:08,540 --> 02:23:12,700
$20, actually makes weddings into a functional event that

2692
02:23:12,700 --> 02:23:14,140
should have been base game.

2693
02:23:15,020 --> 02:23:18,780
But instead it's packaged into a here's a little cool thing

2694
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:21,980
that we did because let's be honest, Sims 4 is a great game

2695
02:23:21,980 --> 02:23:22,860
base game.

2696
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:23,420
It's cute.

2697
02:23:23,420 --> 02:23:24,300
You can play with it.

2698
02:23:24,300 --> 02:23:25,100
It's functional.

2699
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:28,460
But it's barely functional to the point of a realistic

2700
02:23:28,460 --> 02:23:30,620
simulation of relationships.

2701
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:32,060
It is barely functional.

2702
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:35,980
People had to model this stuff in before EA did their thing.

2703
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:39,100
Yeah, it completely like you had to have add ons.

2704
02:23:39,100 --> 02:23:42,060
You had to have mods in order to make it a fun game.

2705
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:45,020
It was functional for what it was, but they should have

2706
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:48,380
continued to add on to things like weddings or events or

2707
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:49,500
things like that.

2708
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:52,300
But instead they broke it down into different things with

2709
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:55,820
expansions, which are like the newer, like Island Living,

2710
02:23:55,820 --> 02:23:59,580
City Life, stuff like that running about $39.99 or $40 if

2711
02:23:59,580 --> 02:24:00,860
you just want to lump it.

2712
02:24:00,860 --> 02:24:04,700
And then they have game packs, which are like expansions,

2713
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:07,260
but they're for, like, one certain thing, like the wedding

2714
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:11,260
expansion pack, which was about $19 or running you $20.

2715
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:14,860
So if you want to fix one, yeah, it's a patch.

2716
02:24:14,860 --> 02:24:18,540
You're paying $20 for a patch, and then you have stuff packs,

2717
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:21,260
which, like, they have a clutter pack, they have a bathroom

2718
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:22,940
pack, they have an infant pack.

2719
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:24,700
That's all like $10.

2720
02:24:25,660 --> 02:24:28,140
And then you have things like kits that are like one or two

2721
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:30,460
different items that you can buy for $5.

2722
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:34,300
It is very interesting to see that business model next to

2723
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:38,060
something like No Man's Sky, which does these regular

2724
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:39,100
expansion type stuff.

2725
02:24:39,100 --> 02:24:40,860
And they give it away as part of the base game.

2726
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:43,580
Now, granted, the trajectory of those two games has been

2727
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:44,220
very different.

2728
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:47,020
So I understand EA can charge it for The Sims in a way that

2729
02:24:47,020 --> 02:24:48,860
No Man's Sky has to more prove itself.

2730
02:24:49,820 --> 02:24:51,660
But it's just interesting.

2731
02:24:52,380 --> 02:24:55,260
I just find it completely fascinating that instead of making

2732
02:24:55,260 --> 02:24:57,820
a new game, like they're doing that now, of course, like

2733
02:24:57,820 --> 02:24:59,660
they release that they're going to be doing Sims 5.

2734
02:24:59,660 --> 02:25:02,220
But instead of making a new game or going back and doing

2735
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:06,140
free patches for the community, EA went, hold on, I smell

2736
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:08,700
money. And they've done something that no one has ever

2737
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:11,820
been able to recreate in form of, like, loot boxes, because

2738
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:15,820
in loot boxes, the fun is like, oh, my God, I can, like,

2739
02:25:15,820 --> 02:25:17,420
there's a gambling aspect.

2740
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:19,740
There's an addiction to loot boxes.

2741
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:21,580
But to Sims stuff, they have it.

2742
02:25:21,580 --> 02:25:23,740
So it's like, instead of because they could shove a bunch

2743
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:25,500
of this into an expansion pack for like $60.

2744
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:29,420
They could do it with the original ones when they're all

2745
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:29,920
on disk.

2746
02:25:30,460 --> 02:25:31,100
Yeah.

2747
02:25:31,100 --> 02:25:34,540
But nowadays they go, oh, it's just $5 for an extra kit.

2748
02:25:34,540 --> 02:25:36,540
It's just $20 for an extra pack.

2749
02:25:36,540 --> 02:25:39,820
It's like, it's not a lot of money, quote unquote.

2750
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:42,460
So it gets you with the like, oh, yeah, I could just blow

2751
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:45,740
that. But then if you buy everything that's close to $1,000.

2752
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:49,420
Now you're giving it $20 a month for how many years?

2753
02:25:49,420 --> 02:25:51,340
And that's how they get you.

2754
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:54,460
And then to add insult to all of this, at the end of all

2755
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:58,300
that, after Sims 5 comes out, you know there's going to be

2756
02:25:58,300 --> 02:26:01,980
a Sims 4 Ultimate Edition that they release all over again

2757
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:02,780
for $70.

2758
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:04,220
That is the whole enchilada.

2759
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:06,300
It's the whole $990, whatever.

2760
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:07,580
We already got that.

2761
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:08,300
Oh, really?

2762
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:13,100
But we already got some sort of controversy like that.

2763
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:16,380
See, last year, the reason why I got back into the Sims

2764
02:26:16,380 --> 02:26:19,420
again is they released the base game for free.

2765
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:20,700
Oh, that's right.

2766
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:21,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2767
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:25,100
And it's going to be for free for the rest of the shelf life.

2768
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:27,740
You will never have to pay $60 for the base game again.

2769
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:30,860
But what about for everybody who bought the game?

2770
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:35,180
Well, EA had an answer for them.

2771
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:39,260
See, they gave them a voucher for one free $5 kit.

2772
02:26:39,260 --> 02:26:46,460
So paying $60 for the wonderful game.

2773
02:26:46,460 --> 02:26:48,460
Here's a $5 coupon.

2774
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:49,740
Go pick out something you like.

2775
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:50,540
Here's a dollar.

2776
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:51,580
Go see a Star War.

2777
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:54,380
Not a single depreciation value.

2778
02:26:54,380 --> 02:26:57,820
But still, how long did it stay a $60 game?

2779
02:26:58,380 --> 02:26:58,700
Right.

2780
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:02,540
Because it's no longer like a $60 game.

2781
02:27:02,540 --> 02:27:04,860
Now it's basically a free to play.

2782
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:06,780
Like Sims Multi.

2783
02:27:06,780 --> 02:27:08,540
Have you ever played the Sims Mobile game?

2784
02:27:08,540 --> 02:27:10,060
The Sims 4 Mobile game?

2785
02:27:10,060 --> 02:27:11,100
We did for a hot minute.

2786
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:15,660
It is practically unplayable without any of the add on purchases.

2787
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:23,580
It is pretty much like you cannot play Sims Mobile without any add ons because of that's

2788
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:24,620
how it's built.

2789
02:27:24,620 --> 02:27:29,260
So basically, they just turned Sims Mobile into what they want the Sims to be, where

2790
02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:33,020
you can play to a certain extent before you're like, Oh, well, this is getting kind of bored

2791
02:27:33,020 --> 02:27:33,980
monotonous.

2792
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:35,180
Let me buy this pack.

2793
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:35,980
Let me buy this.

2794
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:37,100
Let me buy that.

2795
02:27:37,100 --> 02:27:38,620
It's just five dollars.

2796
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:39,900
It's just, it's just.

2797
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:46,540
Well, and on top of that, there's other modders that are doing stuff a lot better than EA

2798
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:47,040
did.

2799
02:27:47,660 --> 02:27:49,900
The Maxis art was cute for a minute.

2800
02:27:51,340 --> 02:27:51,900
And no.

2801
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:56,060
I want to get on the community a little bit about it.

2802
02:27:56,060 --> 02:27:58,620
Like the Sims resource, which is one like reputable.

2803
02:27:58,620 --> 02:27:59,660
You can go there all the time.

2804
02:28:00,300 --> 02:28:03,420
They're now doing like memberships to get out of ads and whatnot.

2805
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:08,220
So it's all becoming like the Sims is becoming kind of like a luxury sort of ordeal where

2806
02:28:08,220 --> 02:28:11,260
you can kind of pay to be part of a certain community.

2807
02:28:11,260 --> 02:28:14,940
And I just might pay for them because it was three bucks a month, but still.

2808
02:28:15,500 --> 02:28:19,820
Yeah, but still like that's three bucks a month on top of all the other things that

2809
02:28:19,820 --> 02:28:23,340
you're if you're like doing Sims content, because I know a lot of people are doing just

2810
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:24,220
Sims content.

2811
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:29,260
You know, call me call me old school, but I would I would love to get a new Sims City

2812
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:29,580
game.

2813
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:33,980
And I know there was that reboot a few years ago that again, it had the always online thing.

2814
02:28:33,980 --> 02:28:35,260
It didn't land well at all.

2815
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:38,060
But I'd love to see that concept revisited.

2816
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:39,020
I love Sim City.

2817
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:46,220
I think with how EA is doing things and how they are very much on the board of let's get

2818
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:48,220
a bunch of money for one thing.

2819
02:28:48,220 --> 02:28:55,340
I know they're probably going to milk Sims 5 just like this, except the base pack for

2820
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:56,460
Sims 5.

2821
02:28:56,460 --> 02:29:03,420
Or you can buy the deluxe pack that comes with 10 game packs of your choosing or one

2822
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:05,980
expansion because it will even give you less than that.

2823
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:11,820
Yeah, no, what they do on EA actually right now is you can bundle them and pick one game

2824
02:29:11,820 --> 02:29:16,940
pass, one expansion, one stuff, one kit, and then you get it for like 5% cheaper, it feels

2825
02:29:16,940 --> 02:29:18,220
like because it's not a lot.

2826
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:23,020
The reason why they keep doing is because they can get away with it.

2827
02:29:23,020 --> 02:29:24,860
Oh yeah, and they get so much money out of it.

2828
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:31,660
Because again, if you have everything for the Sims, it is a very easily, without any

2829
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:35,420
mods at all, you can turn it into an entire empire of content.

2830
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:38,860
Especially if you use cheat codes.

2831
02:29:38,860 --> 02:29:42,780
If you can move things around and clutter and do all the pretty aesthetic stuff, you

2832
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:45,420
can just make a lot of content just from doing that.

2833
02:29:45,420 --> 02:29:48,380
You don't even need mods, mods make it better.

2834
02:29:48,380 --> 02:29:50,620
They just motherload it and you're set.

2835
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:58,300
I have been playing around with the up and down motions where you can raise and lower

2836
02:29:58,300 --> 02:30:00,780
objects and it is a game changer.

2837
02:30:01,660 --> 02:30:07,260
If you can abuse the basement settings so that you can make things not on the same layer

2838
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:10,700
but you can use them on the same layer or lower objects so you can hide them inside

2839
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:11,740
of better looking objects.

2840
02:30:11,740 --> 02:30:12,860
It is fascinating.

2841
02:30:12,860 --> 02:30:17,980
I learned how to make spiral staircases and split level houses all from manipulating the

2842
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:18,620
game engine.

2843
02:30:19,580 --> 02:30:23,020
Yeah, that was my jam.

2844
02:30:23,020 --> 02:30:25,100
I kind of want to learn more things every day.

2845
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:26,540
I love Sims 4, I really do.

2846
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:30,940
EA hit the nail on the head with that kind of concept and people can't really replicate

2847
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:33,020
it without making the Sims.

2848
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:38,380
But EA is absolutely disgusting in how they've been treating their content packs.

2849
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:42,140
And with all that money they're making, they go and they lay off workers.

2850
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:42,860
Boy oh boy.

2851
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:49,020
I will say I am very happy with them for their LGBTQ content that they've released for free.

2852
02:30:49,660 --> 02:30:55,580
From what I looked over, the binder packs, the scar packs that they have for it, they

2853
02:30:55,580 --> 02:30:57,420
are actually really good.

2854
02:30:57,420 --> 02:31:02,620
They have figure slimming things that you can get, which are gender affirming for trans

2855
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:03,020
women.

2856
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:08,140
They have binders, they have top surgery scars, the different kinds.

2857
02:31:08,140 --> 02:31:10,220
All that stuff has honestly looked really good.

2858
02:31:10,220 --> 02:31:13,740
Yeah, to EA's credit, they tend to be ahead of the curve.

2859
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:16,940
I remember they were at the early gamer X conventions before a lot of companies are

2860
02:31:16,940 --> 02:31:19,820
getting on board and stuff, and they've always been a little bit ahead of the curve on that

2861
02:31:19,820 --> 02:31:19,980
stuff.

2862
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,500
So credit where credit is due.

2863
02:31:22,460 --> 02:31:27,100
The way that they handled trans characters, just to begin with, that you picked.

2864
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:31,020
Yeah, you could pick physical body, but you could pick different voice and you could pick

2865
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:31,260
different.

2866
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:33,340
They handled it really well.

2867
02:31:33,340 --> 02:31:35,020
Remember SimCopter.

2868
02:31:35,020 --> 02:31:38,540
It goes all the way back to SimCopter and some of the things that they put in those

2869
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:39,020
games.

2870
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:43,740
So anyway, currently you can actually pick your own pronouns, like your Sims pronouns,

2871
02:31:43,740 --> 02:31:45,340
and you can do custom pronouns.

2872
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:46,700
That's awesome.

2873
02:31:46,700 --> 02:31:48,780
So you can make that up.

2874
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:53,260
And also, although I will say that it took that update for them to also add medical equipment

2875
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:54,620
for disabled folks.

2876
02:31:54,620 --> 02:32:00,380
We don't have the wheelchair yet, but you can have an insulin pump and a cochlear ear

2877
02:32:00,380 --> 02:32:01,660
implant for your Sim.

2878
02:32:01,660 --> 02:32:02,140
That's cool.

2879
02:32:03,100 --> 02:32:03,580
All right.

2880
02:32:03,580 --> 02:32:07,340
Well, Fixie, I got to let you go to try to squeeze in one more call before we get to

2881
02:32:07,340 --> 02:32:08,060
Dead by Daylight.

2882
02:32:08,060 --> 02:32:10,140
But thank you so much for calling in.

2883
02:32:10,140 --> 02:32:16,460
I hope everything goes swimmingly with your own channel and all that.

2884
02:32:16,460 --> 02:32:18,700
And if folks aren't following you, I hope they will.

2885
02:32:19,820 --> 02:32:20,220
Of course.

2886
02:32:20,220 --> 02:32:21,420
Thank you for having me so much.

2887
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:25,340
I love listening in and I love adding feedback, so I will bow out now.

2888
02:32:25,340 --> 02:32:26,060
Thank you for having me here.

2889
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:26,460
Take care.

2890
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:28,140
You're a welcome part of our community.

2891
02:32:29,260 --> 02:32:29,500
All right.

2892
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:30,380
Take care, friend.

2893
02:32:30,380 --> 02:32:31,740
Oh, there they went.

2894
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:33,100
Okay, one more call.

2895
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:34,940
We're going to squeeze in here before we wrap it up for tonight.

2896
02:32:34,940 --> 02:32:35,980
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2897
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:36,380
Who's this?

2898
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:39,020
So one and only Rama.

2899
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:40,300
How is everybody doing tonight?

2900
02:32:40,300 --> 02:32:41,580
I am doing fantastic.

2901
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:44,060
I don't know why you're coming through quiet, but I'll fix that in a minute.

2902
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:44,700
How are you, Rama?

2903
02:32:45,340 --> 02:32:45,740
I'm good.

2904
02:32:45,740 --> 02:32:46,380
Hold on.

2905
02:32:46,380 --> 02:32:53,820
I got a new microphone stand and I've been adjusting it so that people can hear me.

2906
02:32:53,820 --> 02:32:58,220
So if I'm coming off too low, that means I need to move the mic closer to myself.

2907
02:32:58,220 --> 02:32:59,180
I apologize.

2908
02:32:59,180 --> 02:32:59,660
You're fine.

2909
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:00,940
I can always boost you in Discord.

2910
02:33:00,940 --> 02:33:02,220
You're not that quiet.

2911
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:04,700
Just maybe reading a little quieter than the three of us.

2912
02:33:05,420 --> 02:33:06,620
But what's on your mind tonight, my friend?

2913
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:09,340
Things now.

2914
02:33:09,340 --> 02:33:09,740
Great.

2915
02:33:09,740 --> 02:33:13,900
I'm not on because I don't want to hit the wrong button and get booted from the chat.

2916
02:33:13,900 --> 02:33:15,580
So I'm just going to leave it as is.

2917
02:33:15,580 --> 02:33:20,300
So there's originally three things I wanted to talk about, but due to time constraints,

2918
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:21,820
I'll cut it down to two.

2919
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:22,380
All right.

2920
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:24,700
Number one, tick tock.

2921
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:31,900
Now, in my field of work, it's understandable for the employees who have it on their personal

2922
02:33:31,900 --> 02:33:33,020
phones and so forth.

2923
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:39,100
And I can say this, given the nature of my work, if we handed out company phones, that

2924
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:42,780
will be an OK application to have.

2925
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:49,900
Now, granted, we've had discussions in the chat about data mining and so forth, about

2926
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:52,300
Facebook getting caught out there and so forth.

2927
02:33:52,860 --> 02:33:59,340
Now, I have not been following my IT papers as much as I normally would have.

2928
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:06,780
But going back a couple of years around a certain time or certain somebody was hating

2929
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:12,060
on tick tock, even before that, I.T.

2930
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:19,260
people in higher standing network engineers, people from various companies and entities

2931
02:34:19,260 --> 02:34:23,020
were saying that tick tock should not be on your phone.

2932
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:29,180
And it's more of the aspect of the permissions that the app is has and is pulling more

2933
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:31,820
information than it should.

2934
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:33,580
Is it different from Facebook, though?

2935
02:34:34,940 --> 02:34:41,340
I would say, all right, from a personal point of view, there is no difference from a technical

2936
02:34:41,340 --> 02:34:44,860
point of view, from the data that they're pulling, give or take.

2937
02:34:44,860 --> 02:34:50,860
I think it's more like even though the app has the permissions to grab certain data,

2938
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:53,100
it's how it's pulling the data.

2939
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:56,700
Again, it's been a few years since I've been reading papers on this.

2940
02:34:56,700 --> 02:34:58,060
But what's interesting is.

2941
02:34:59,260 --> 02:35:00,460
They were I.T.

2942
02:35:00,460 --> 02:35:05,660
people who were saying that, you know, you should not have to talk on your phone.

2943
02:35:05,660 --> 02:35:12,460
And then when a certain somebody got butthurt about being teased on tick tock, that's when

2944
02:35:12,460 --> 02:35:15,100
it came in as a center of attraction.

2945
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:19,420
But what's funny is people were wanting to ban it because of a certain somebody getting

2946
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:25,660
offended, not because of the additional data that it is not supposed to have.

2947
02:35:26,380 --> 02:35:28,220
Which is kind of crazy to me.

2948
02:35:28,220 --> 02:35:31,500
Well, and the real reason people want to ban it is because of the China connection.

2949
02:35:31,500 --> 02:35:33,020
Let's just call it what it is like.

2950
02:35:33,020 --> 02:35:34,060
It's that's what it is.

2951
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:36,700
That's why it's being treated differently than other social media applications.

2952
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:44,300
Well, I will say I'm not on TikTok, but I have friends, cosplayers, content creators

2953
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:45,500
that are on there.

2954
02:35:45,500 --> 02:35:47,980
I can tell you that it seems that TikTok.

2955
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:59,500
Plays to certain colors, genders and so forth, because I have been told, you know, if you

2956
02:35:59,500 --> 02:36:04,780
are LGBT, expect yourself on TikTok to be a little bit lower than everybody else.

2957
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:09,260
And they have been called out for and they've been caught red handed for this numerous times.

2958
02:36:10,220 --> 02:36:12,700
The algorithm is an interesting thing on TikTok.

2959
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:17,500
I would just say my experience is that with very minimal effort, I've been exposed to

2960
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:22,380
a lot more people than probably even on Twitch or some other platforms.

2961
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:25,260
And I've made two short videos on TikTok.

2962
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:29,100
It's not something I'm super invested in as a platform, but that algorithm has definitely

2963
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:29,980
caught my attention.

2964
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:37,020
I'm not well researched enough on some of the comments about LGBT suppression and things

2965
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:40,620
of that nature to comment any further on that.

2966
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:42,380
I can just speak to the experience I've had so far.

2967
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:44,060
And you're right.

2968
02:36:44,060 --> 02:36:50,060
And I will say I know people whose engagement on TikTok is much higher than it has been

2969
02:36:50,060 --> 02:36:54,860
on Twitter, Instagram and everywhere else.

2970
02:36:54,860 --> 02:36:59,180
But, you know, again, I am not on there because I am not that creative.

2971
02:36:59,180 --> 02:37:01,180
I will watch other people's TikToks.

2972
02:37:01,180 --> 02:37:06,380
I don't think people need to see a TikTok of me screaming at my computer while I'm editing

2973
02:37:06,380 --> 02:37:12,300
over 3000 cosplay videos while holding a bottle, an unmarked bottle of hooch in my hand.

2974
02:37:12,300 --> 02:37:12,800
Okay.

2975
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:13,980
All right.

2976
02:37:13,980 --> 02:37:15,660
Quickly, what was the other thing you want to talk about tonight?

2977
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:22,940
You know, I think I might have now three.

2978
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:23,580
Oh, sure.

2979
02:37:25,820 --> 02:37:32,700
We don't need E3, but in the aspect of we need E3 elaborate.

2980
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:33,820
Okay.

2981
02:37:33,820 --> 02:37:40,060
So I was traveling yesterday and one of my group chats, people were talking about E3,

2982
02:37:40,060 --> 02:37:42,060
how E3 is useless.

2983
02:37:42,060 --> 02:37:45,900
We don't need E3 because we have packs and this and that.

2984
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:49,820
I had to stop what I was doing to kind of educate people.

2985
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:55,500
Now, if I am wrong about E3, please correct me because y'all are the gurus.

2986
02:37:56,940 --> 02:37:58,540
I think I know what you're going to say.

2987
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,540
So please say it, because, yes, I will.

2988
02:38:00,540 --> 02:38:05,340
I will course correct if I if it's not what I think you're going to say.

2989
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:06,460
Thank you.

2990
02:38:06,460 --> 02:38:13,580
I said to the fellows, people in the chat, E3 is not PAX.

2991
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:19,980
PAX was kind of created to give the smaller independent publishers and people a voice

2992
02:38:19,980 --> 02:38:21,820
that he did not have it.

2993
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:27,420
E3 is industrial trade show.

2994
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:30,940
People in the industry go to E3.

2995
02:38:30,940 --> 02:38:31,740
Correct.

2996
02:38:31,740 --> 02:38:32,540
Yes, you are right.

2997
02:38:33,180 --> 02:38:35,820
E3 is not for the public.

2998
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:42,220
What you see at PAX, you would see a beta revision at E3.

2999
02:38:42,220 --> 02:38:43,900
There is a difference.

3000
02:38:43,900 --> 02:38:52,620
You let the general person go to E3 and they're playing a beta of so and so game part five.

3001
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:58,140
That average person is going to go on their socials and bitch about how terrible the game

3002
02:38:58,140 --> 02:39:03,260
is compared to somebody within the industry, whether they're a developer, a creator or

3003
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:05,180
journalist would explain.

3004
02:39:05,180 --> 02:39:07,180
This is how it looks at this point.

3005
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:09,420
This is what we're looking forward to towards the end.

3006
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:09,740
Right.

3007
02:39:09,740 --> 02:39:15,100
And the short way of saying that to your friend is quite simply and succinctly this.

3008
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:17,820
E3 isn't for you, period.

3009
02:39:17,820 --> 02:39:19,020
That's what it is.

3010
02:39:19,020 --> 02:39:25,420
And yeah, and everything you're saying about people would not be able to put their critical

3011
02:39:25,420 --> 02:39:26,700
eye aside.

3012
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:31,420
And this is why Square Enix, and I remember this when they were showing off, I think I

3013
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:37,020
played Final Fantasy 13 at E3 and I wanted to get pictures of it, but they would not

3014
02:39:37,020 --> 02:39:38,780
even let you take pictures of the screen.

3015
02:39:38,780 --> 02:39:42,460
Even though they had a demo out there, they did not want people taking pictures of it

3016
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:43,820
because it wasn't the final product.

3017
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:45,740
They didn't want people publishing pictures of that.

3018
02:39:46,700 --> 02:39:49,500
That was an early peak is what it was.

3019
02:39:49,500 --> 02:39:54,940
And those were some of the signs that showed that E3 was becoming this other monster

3020
02:39:55,420 --> 02:39:56,940
that it wasn't really ever supposed to be.

3021
02:39:58,940 --> 02:40:04,140
So another thing with E3 said, we're going to let the general public in.

3022
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:10,940
Do you know how many cosplayers got excited about going to another con to party and have

3023
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:11,980
a good time?

3024
02:40:11,980 --> 02:40:19,260
I'm just sitting there drinking my tea going, you're going to have a bad time.

3025
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:20,860
And they're like, why?

3026
02:40:20,860 --> 02:40:26,060
I'm just like, you do realize this is not a three day weekend thing.

3027
02:40:27,020 --> 02:40:31,420
Everything ends around five thirty six o'clock.

3028
02:40:32,700 --> 02:40:35,740
And that's why I say E3 died that year.

3029
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:41,100
And we've just been running around its corpse like weekend at Bernie's, especially, you

3030
02:40:41,100 --> 02:40:43,180
know, what did I say on Twitter?

3031
02:40:43,260 --> 02:40:49,660
Something like E3 died in twenty seventeen, twenty nineteen and the excuse me, twenty

3032
02:40:49,660 --> 02:40:54,220
twenty in the pandemic and everything killed what was already a corpse, basically.

3033
02:40:54,220 --> 02:40:56,700
And now we've been trying to run it around like weekend at Bernie's.

3034
02:40:56,700 --> 02:40:58,300
And it's just not happening.

3035
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:00,380
And let's be real.

3036
02:41:01,020 --> 02:41:02,460
Let's be real here.

3037
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:05,340
Rob, let's not let's not pull any shit right here.

3038
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:12,060
I don't know about you, but again, when I heard that RePop got their hands on E3, I

3039
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:15,100
knew it was over right then and there.

3040
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:20,300
It's that scene from The Simpsons where you say, stop, stop.

3041
02:41:20,300 --> 02:41:21,660
You're killing him already.

3042
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:27,900
Yeah, I was the same scene with RePop, their hands on it because they were going to turn

3043
02:41:27,900 --> 02:41:29,420
that into another pax.

3044
02:41:29,420 --> 02:41:31,820
And I will testify on that.

3045
02:41:31,820 --> 02:41:33,740
And can I get an amen?

3046
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:35,740
Well, I hope your audio is coming through now.

3047
02:41:35,740 --> 02:41:40,860
Here's the thing that for me, that when that whole thing went down, that was just more

3048
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:43,820
like, so this is just further proof.

3049
02:41:43,820 --> 02:41:47,020
The E3 you used to know no longer exists.

3050
02:41:49,580 --> 02:41:51,180
Go back and check the tapes.

3051
02:41:51,180 --> 02:41:53,500
I know that's what I said back then.

3052
02:41:53,500 --> 02:41:56,300
This is already proof that E3 is a different show now.

3053
02:41:56,300 --> 02:41:58,540
It's not the same show you remember from 2006.

3054
02:41:59,260 --> 02:42:04,380
I think also RePop realized, oh, we can't make any money on losses.

3055
02:42:04,380 --> 02:42:05,740
Let's move on.

3056
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:09,740
Because I think we're kind of at a point where we don't need E3.

3057
02:42:09,740 --> 02:42:12,300
But again, we need something.

3058
02:42:12,300 --> 02:42:18,140
I mean, I don't think the gamers realize how lucky and spoiled they are.

3059
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:25,260
All of these YouTube reels and live streams this and live streams that 20 years ago.

3060
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:27,820
Where were we getting our information from?

3061
02:42:27,820 --> 02:42:31,660
The July issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly or GamePro?

3062
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:38,060
The industry now has Game Developers Conference, and they're very smart to just not invite

3063
02:42:38,060 --> 02:42:40,780
the media to that or in very limited capacity.

3064
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:46,060
Because this has already happened where people have tried to treat the Game Developers Conference

3065
02:42:46,060 --> 02:42:47,420
as if it was E3.

3066
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:49,180
They left sorely disappointed.

3067
02:42:49,180 --> 02:42:57,180
And somehow Game Developers Conference for at least the last probably since 2015, 2014

3068
02:42:57,180 --> 02:43:02,220
has managed to exist kind of as an industry game developers event that people don't like

3069
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:06,140
the consumer and the average gamer, whatever, don't put a lot of stock in.

3070
02:43:06,140 --> 02:43:07,900
And so that's good.

3071
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:11,580
That's where game developers want their trade show to be.

3072
02:43:11,580 --> 02:43:14,940
So don't let's not spread the word.

3073
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:22,780
The Game Developers Conference is the new E3, but it's a secret to everyone.

3074
02:43:23,900 --> 02:43:24,780
It's like this.

3075
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:26,220
The best way I can say it is like this.

3076
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:30,620
GDC is the science of gaming.

3077
02:43:31,900 --> 02:43:35,900
E3 is where the science becomes magic.

3078
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:37,340
I see some awesome stuff.

3079
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:43,500
It might do the magic black smoke and they may close the curtain, but you ain't got to

3080
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:49,500
worry about it because there is an awesome nerd back there typing away and getting it

3081
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:52,220
done so that you have an awesome game for Christmas.

3082
02:43:52,220 --> 02:43:53,180
I have a small correction.

3083
02:43:53,180 --> 02:43:57,660
I would say GDC is the science of the industry and all those great things you said.

3084
02:43:58,300 --> 02:44:00,860
E3 is dead.

3085
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:05,660
That's that's pour it out.

3086
02:44:05,660 --> 02:44:07,820
All right, Rama, I got to let you go so we can wrap up.

3087
02:44:07,820 --> 02:44:09,420
Thank you so much, my friend, for the call.

3088
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:12,220
I hope everybody will check out Anime Jam Session.

3089
02:44:12,220 --> 02:44:17,980
Lots of great coverage on shows that are for fans, actually, over there on Anime Jam Session.

3090
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:21,820
Rob, I am offended that you said pour one out.

3091
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:25,180
I wouldn't pour out a can of Bud Light for E3.

3092
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:28,400
Ew.

3093
02:44:31,660 --> 02:44:32,220
Point taken.

3094
02:44:33,260 --> 02:44:34,380
Point taken.

3095
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:35,660
All right, Rama, take care, my friend.

3096
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:37,580
All right, later, y'all.

3097
02:44:37,580 --> 02:44:38,080
Bye.

3098
02:44:39,020 --> 02:44:39,740
Oh, my God.

3099
02:44:39,740 --> 02:44:40,540
All right.

3100
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:41,980
That is going to do it for another episode.

3101
02:44:41,980 --> 02:44:45,100
I might have turned up in my mouth a little bit at the mention of Bud Light.

3102
02:44:45,100 --> 02:44:45,420
I know.

3103
02:44:45,420 --> 02:44:46,380
I don't blame you.

3104
02:44:46,380 --> 02:44:48,380
Quickly, quickly, Loki, any last minute stories?

3105
02:44:49,100 --> 02:44:50,540
Yeah, I did have one.

3106
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:56,460
There is a special offer going on right now through Square Enix where you can download

3107
02:44:57,260 --> 02:45:00,460
Stormblood for free for Final Fantasy 14.

3108
02:45:01,100 --> 02:45:02,940
That promotion doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

3109
02:45:02,940 --> 02:45:04,700
Why not just make it free free?

3110
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:05,900
It's it's weird.

3111
02:45:05,900 --> 02:45:08,060
It's free until May 28th.

3112
02:45:08,060 --> 02:45:10,140
So if you're interested, go do it.

3113
02:45:10,780 --> 02:45:14,300
But yeah, it's considering getting back into 14.

3114
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:17,580
But I don't really have any people who play at the time.

3115
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:18,080
I would.

3116
02:45:19,340 --> 02:45:21,340
I kind of want to get back into Star Trek online.

3117
02:45:22,380 --> 02:45:23,980
Oh, that's a blast to the past.

3118
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:25,340
I love that game so much.

3119
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:29,260
Just all I did was run around in Deep Space Nine and hang out with Morn.

3120
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:31,680
All right.

3121
02:45:32,300 --> 02:45:35,100
Well, with that, we're going to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.

3122
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:37,660
Thank you so much for downloading and checking out Orange Launch Radio.

3123
02:45:37,660 --> 02:45:38,540
We appreciate you all.

02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:41,020
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3125
02:45:41,020 --> 02:45:42,860
Help us add more voices to the pool.

3126
02:45:43,420 --> 02:45:46,220
Join us live here on Sunday nights over at VOG Network.

3127
02:45:46,220 --> 02:45:48,780
Or if you want, you can also listen to us on the podcast.

3128
02:45:48,780 --> 02:45:53,180
Of course, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is that

3129
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:55,260
you found this show goes an awful long way.

3130
02:45:56,300 --> 02:45:57,500
We really appreciate all of that.

3131
02:45:57,500 --> 02:46:02,220
Tell a friend, tell an enemy, just tell somebody because actually the show we have been getting

3132
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:05,340
a few more new faces here lately, which has been nice.

3133
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:07,020
We want more, more.

3134
02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:08,380
So help us.

3135
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:09,660
We would really appreciate that.

3136
02:46:10,780 --> 02:46:12,620
Let's go give folks final thought.

3137
02:46:12,620 --> 02:46:14,940
Dark Sakura, I know you're off to go do Dead by Daylight.

3138
02:46:14,940 --> 02:46:16,380
Do you have a final thought for us tonight?

3139
02:46:17,500 --> 02:46:24,140
Yes, I'm having a subathon on April 19th, and really, it's more of just an excuse to

3140
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:29,180
have people hang out with me on my birthday who I can't see in person, but it will be

3141
02:46:30,220 --> 02:46:30,780
on my channel.

3142
02:46:30,780 --> 02:46:31,900
I'm playing Dead by Daylight.

3143
02:46:32,140 --> 02:46:37,580
Having a midnight suns and cold to the lamb palate cleanser, but I'm planning on going

3144
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:40,700
at minimum 18 hours and I'm going to aim for 24.

3145
02:46:41,820 --> 02:46:44,620
There will be appearances by Midna and artwork giveaways.

3146
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:46,000
All right.

3147
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:47,580
Oh boy.

3148
02:46:47,580 --> 02:46:47,740
All right.

3149
02:46:47,740 --> 02:46:54,540
So in the meantime, I'm going to play DVD now.

3150
02:46:54,540 --> 02:46:54,940
Bye.

3151
02:46:54,940 --> 02:46:55,180
All right.

3152
02:46:55,180 --> 02:46:55,580
Have fun.

3153
02:46:57,100 --> 02:46:57,580
All right.

3154
02:46:57,580 --> 02:46:59,340
Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.

3155
02:47:00,060 --> 02:47:06,140
I'm just trying to get my content creation down to less than a month between episodes

3156
02:47:06,140 --> 02:47:06,940
of things.

3157
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:08,220
So good call.

3158
02:47:09,820 --> 02:47:12,860
It helps to be able to get more videos out and spreading the word.

3159
02:47:12,860 --> 02:47:13,500
That's for sure.

3160
02:47:13,500 --> 02:47:14,060
Yes.

3161
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:17,740
So that's why starting yet another series is a great idea.

3162
02:47:17,740 --> 02:47:18,460
Yeah, good call.

3163
02:47:19,980 --> 02:47:21,260
My final thought tonight.

3164
02:47:21,260 --> 02:47:22,380
I don't have a lot.

3165
02:47:22,380 --> 02:47:25,180
My life outside of the show has been pretty busy.

3166
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:27,260
Can't talk about that right now.

3167
02:47:27,260 --> 02:47:28,780
I'll talk about it in a week or two.

3168
02:47:28,780 --> 02:47:30,380
It's nothing to do with OLR gaming.

3169
02:47:30,380 --> 02:47:31,740
It's just interesting stuff.

3170
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:35,900
So I'll talk about that in a couple of weeks, but otherwise, that's it.

3171
02:47:35,900 --> 02:47:38,300
I hope everybody is doing well and great.

3172
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:42,140
Looking forward to getting back to some conventions, things like Dragon Con.

3173
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:46,540
Looking forward to hoping to meet some people over Labor Day and check out some events here

3174
02:47:46,540 --> 02:47:47,260
locally, too.

3175
02:47:47,260 --> 02:47:51,660
I think we're supposed to go to one in mid April, so I'm supposed to more info on that

3176
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:52,140
next week.

3177
02:47:52,140 --> 02:47:54,060
Maybe I got to get all the details on that.

3178
02:47:54,060 --> 02:47:55,580
So anyway, that's it.

3179
02:47:55,580 --> 02:47:55,980
We're done.

3180
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:56,780
We're out of here for the night.

3181
02:47:56,780 --> 02:47:57,900
Have a great night, everybody.

3182
02:47:57,900 --> 02:47:59,340
We will see you in seven days.

3183
02:47:59,340 --> 02:48:00,940
We'll do this all over again.

3184
02:48:00,940 --> 02:48:02,220
I can't wait to see you.

3185
02:48:02,220 --> 02:48:03,020
Until next time.

3186
02:48:03,820 --> 02:48:04,300
Bye bye.

3187
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:44,860
See you next week.
