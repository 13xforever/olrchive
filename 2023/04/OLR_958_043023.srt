1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,440
My gaming PC has a 2080 Ti and I've been enjoying max graphics quality for everything

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,440
I play.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,480
Tonight I learned that Diablo 4 will officially end this streak and now I will have to start

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,080
saving up for a graphics card that's going to be at least 200% more voluminous for 1%

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
better graphics.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,840
Gotta get ready for that 8K ray-traced DLSS lifelock frames for a second, we live in a

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,040
simulation quality!

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,120
This is your better than real life quality update, now it's time for your hosts Rob

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,040
Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
gaming news.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,200
Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,120
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,960
where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,880
It is Orange Lounge Radio, we're here once again, episode number 958 of our show for

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,020
tonight April the 30th of 2023 and you know what that means of course, tomorrow it's going

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,020
to be what?

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,720
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, hey how are you doing?

18
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
Hi.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Hi.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
I'm sore.

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
You're sore?

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,440
Yeah, I did two hours of ballet today.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Oh fun.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:22,320
I actually started my first online class and even though it was a beginner, just imagine

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,040
being on one foot with one lifted just to the ankle and going from demi-plié directly

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,400
into relevé so you're, it's like a half squat and then all the way on your tiptoes, ten

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,480
times in a row in one foot.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:45,240
I hurt in places I did not know I could hurt before because ballet does not use like most

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,800
of the muscles you would think of in sports, it uses a lot of those little muscles.

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
But then that means it's good.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
That's good.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You're working them out.

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,760
But being in a turnout with your feet like that, it's all rotation from the hips and

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,040
honestly enough, my hip doesn't hurt in the way it normally does, it's the muscles that

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,400
hurt so I'm feeling really good about it.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,740
Ironically, tying it back to games, that's how I felt after Wii Fit you know or even

37
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,760
oh god Ring Fit, remember Ring Fit?

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,660
Even just kind of going through that the first few times, it's like oh I definitely need

39
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,200
to work out more because you know this is wearing me out.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,380
I should try those types of games again now that I've had a better cardio routine in the

41
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,260
last couple of years than I've had in a very long, since I was in my 20s honestly.

42
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,620
So yeah.

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,980
I want to get Ring Fit for the yoga stuff.

44
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,540
I don't know if I'll need a balance board for any of that.

45
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,540
No, Ring Fit's independent from the balance board stuff.

46
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:53,100
But the thing is, is that I think our Wii is in a box somewhere, somewhere.

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,220
And so I might have to find something else.

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:06,740
I would love it if there was something that would use one of the sensor cameras.

49
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:14,020
Going back to earlier technology that was, that tried to be big, that would be good for

50
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,100
registering like your general position, like you're in a certain place, although it wouldn't

51
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,860
necessarily work with a bar I think because the bar would take up space, but just something

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:32,420
that generally would measure is your foot in the right position, are your hips in the

53
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,140
right turnout, things like that.

54
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,460
I think that would be really tremendous and I think Nintendo would be the right company

55
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:48,580
to do something like that with their focus on general health and wellbeing and group

56
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,820
oriented activities, I'd say.

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,820
I don't see them doing it through a camera, but the whole idea of like strapping joy cons

58
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,140
and using the joy cons to kind of measure positions, I could see that.

59
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,660
And actually, since you do kind of reference it, I could see, we kind of have no idea what

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,660
to expect from Nintendo after Zelda, right?

61
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,620
Like we really don't know, like we know Metroid Prime 4 is being worked on for something at

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,740
some point, but generally we don't know what Nintendo plans to release.

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:22,100
And I would think another fitness game would be like, I don't want to say like a low hanging

64
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,080
fruit, but I don't know what it's called, like an easy win for Nintendo for the holiday

65
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,580
to do some type of, even if it's not like Ring Fit Adventure 2, some type of switch

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,660
fitness type of thing would just seem like an easy thing for Nintendo.

67
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,340
But here I am, video games are easy to make, just push a button, I get it.

68
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,780
But I still feel like a game like that probably takes less developmental muscle than something

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,340
like a Zelda or a Mario even where you're designing all these levels and graphics to

70
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,600
go with them and everything else.

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,140
So I don't know.

72
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,980
This is where I think Peloton could get into the gaming industry.

73
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,660
They kind of, some might argue they're trying to already, yeah.

74
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,140
They're very rudimentary, but yes.

75
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,260
If they put out their bikes for how expensive they are, what if they put out like a mocap

76
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,260
suit that just has the sensors built into the suit and then you work out in the suit

77
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:27,460
or you have like little sensors you attach to certain parts of yourself and then you

78
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,580
would move along with it.

79
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,660
And then on top of that, they re-market it as a controller, instead of how terrible the

80
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,180
activator was, we now have the Pelotator?

81
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,740
Call me Peloton, I'm smart.

82
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,460
Not to go too far down this rabbit hole, but oops, it is an episode of OLR.

83
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,060
The thing with Peloton is that they're kind of known for being extremely pricey and now

84
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,100
they're having a hard time, now that pandemic lockdowns are easing up and people are going

85
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,180
back to their traditional gyms, they're having a hard time hanging on and I think if they

86
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,380
can lower that cost by maybe putting out like teaming up and putting a Peloton app

87
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,820
on Switch or even Xbox, PlayStation, you name it, or just general something that's on all

88
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,900
three and doing something a little more accessible, I think would be like a win for them.

89
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,340
But what do I know?

90
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,520
I'm just some person.

91
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,580
But I know Mishkins knows a thing or two in our chat saying if I had the money, I'd buy

92
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,740
a bike with the gaming screen, something along those lines.

93
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,380
Anyway, I hate to ignore, I need to say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

94
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
Hi, Loki.

95
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Hello.

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,380
How are you doing?

97
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,380
I'm doing fine.

98
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,900
What do you think of all these exercise games?

99
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,740
Now I joke that you wouldn't play any of these exercise games, but it's actually, you have

100
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,900
one in your garage that you're also not playing, but it's not like we all didn't meet playing

101
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,780
a video game, Dance Dance Revolution, for those who don't know, that led to a lot of

102
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
exercise, right?

103
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
Yeah, that's for sure.

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,820
I mean, I don't know.

105
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,180
I just don't think they're going to release one because I don't think it's going to sell

106
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,860
well, probably because I don't think, you know, anything beyond like Wii Sports hasn't

107
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,700
sold as well as Wii Sports.

108
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:14,100
So like even Switch Sports Resort or whatever it's called now, not the system seller like

109
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,020
Wii Sports was, you know, so I don't think they would do it again.

110
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,300
There's something to be said about when Nintendo was parading around their new consoles around

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,260
the circuit and when it was the Wii, they would show Wii Tennis, Wii Bowling right then

112
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,020
and there as this is what the console can do.

113
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,420
With the Switch, it was Zelda Breath of the Wild was the big game they were showing.

114
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,740
Maybe a little, I would say maybe 10% 1-2 Switch and those little tech demo games and

115
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,580
90% Zelda Breath of the Wild and that whole thing.

116
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,780
And that's what people associate with the Switch.

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,260
So when you put out the sports game kind of like after the fact, I think it was just harder.

118
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,180
I would bet, I would bet the average gamer doesn't even know that game exists.

119
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,340
I would bet the average gamer that bought Wii Sports has no idea.

120
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,980
Switch, did you know Switch did a sequel to Wii Sports?

121
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,660
Yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it, that's Nintendo's problem.

122
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:13,940
So they need to take that shit on The View or just more, not that I'm saying Jamie watches

123
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,620
The View, but other places that, you know, are a little more to hit at the mainstream

124
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,380
folks and, you know, these things.

125
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,460
I don't know why that was the thing that came to mind.

126
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,460
It just was.

127
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,020
On the subject of the Peloton stuff, I always thought it was funny that like in our local

128
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,740
mall here in Roseville, they have a, how do you know what you call it?

129
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,500
Like, I don't think it's a Peloton store.

130
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
It's like a, I call it a cage because that's what it is.

131
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,100
It's a Peloton cage that's in the middle of the mall that you can buy a membership

132
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,540
to to go use the machines in the middle of the mall, like exposed to everybody.

133
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,860
I literally thought that was a showroom.

134
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,460
I thought they were selling the bikes there.

135
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,100
I didn't know that was.

136
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,060
No, I think that you buy membership to that because I remember reading, like, I was like,

137
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,260
I walked in there to look at it.

138
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,940
I'm like, oh, those look expensive.

139
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,620
And then I saw the thing about membership.

140
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,300
Like, who the hell do that?

141
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,980
Like, why would you buy a membership to that?

142
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,260
There's a lot of people who put themselves on display while working out.

143
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,620
I've seen gyms at malls before, but usually they're in the anchor store position.

144
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,180
And I know what's weird about that one is the Peloton is like between, you know, you

145
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,140
know how a mall is like your, your JC Penny on one side and your, I don't know, Sears

146
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,940
or what's in a mall, Nordstrom on the other side or something.

147
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,180
And then between them are all the other stores, right?

148
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,540
That's Peloton is in between.

149
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,100
So I get it.

150
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Like, usually if there's a Crunch Fitness or something, it's, it's on, it's in one

151
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,540
of those anchor spaces.

152
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,580
So it's interesting to be a partnership in advertising.

153
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,380
You know, you have the product out there with real people using it in the middle of the

154
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,260
store and it sparks interest in, in buying when people see, oh, that's how it works.

155
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,100
I see these people, you do the thing.

156
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,420
Why, why don't I have something like that at home?

157
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,060
So I don't have to embarrass myself in the middle of the mall.

158
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,740
I legit thought it was a showroom.

159
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,820
I didn't even realize people actually went in there to work out.

160
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,460
I mean, I thought it was at first, but then, but they know it's, it's.

161
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,740
I guess it's both, but there's also the population paid to advertise.

162
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,540
Have you seen now that car dealerships are in malls?

163
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,060
That's weird to me because you can only fit one or two cars in there, but it's things

164
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,900
like Tesla.

165
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,740
And I've seen another one too.

166
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,700
There, there are places that are, um, like you, you see the one car and then come over

167
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,780
here to this tablet to build your own car, to your own specifications type of thing.

168
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,540
Yeah, weird.

169
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,740
Yeah, it is a little wild.

170
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,540
Tiger claw and chat says malls are a dying breed.

171
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,020
You wouldn't know it from that one in Roseville.

172
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,380
That you just referenced.

173
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,420
And you would know for the one, you would know for the one.

174
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,900
Actually, I, I went to, to Arden fair, um, the week of my birthday.

175
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,220
Cause I had to go get my, my free gift at Sephora and use my Sephora gift card.

176
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,780
Don't judge me.

177
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,060
Um, and, uh, it was pretty busy there too.

178
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,500
Actually it was, and I got to see like the, well, one of my stores is gone.

179
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,620
I'm very sad, but, uh, there were a lot of like different stores as they're in some more

180
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,420
higher end stuff.

181
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Like I think the Armani store is still there.

182
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,380
There's a coach store.

183
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,820
There's the, the, the Sears is of course, um, I think closed up.

184
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,620
Yeah, it's gone.

185
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,420
Yeah, but you know, it's still, it's still kind of lively there.

186
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,180
You know, it is showing up more and more at malls.

187
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,580
I swear.

188
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,260
I feel like I'm repeating myself from two weeks ago.

189
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,060
So stop me if I am.

190
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:41,460
But, but it's, it's all the like, um, import Japanese plushie, anime stuff.

191
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,820
Like I swear I see like three of those stores in every mall now.

192
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,740
And, but not, and even, even more like Miniso, which is a great store.

193
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,380
I love that place, but it's, it's a lot of that stuff showing up.

194
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,180
I didn't see a Miniso there, but I didn't look.

195
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,540
I almost stayed on the bottom floor.

196
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,100
It's upstairs.

197
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,820
That's why you missed it.

198
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,260
It's upstairs by the carousel.

199
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,060
I was almost at where the carousel used to be, but I think it actually is still there.

200
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,180
I just, out of sight.

201
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm sad that Morphe is gone.

202
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,260
Cause that's where I get my eyeliner.

203
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,760
Hello.

204
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,660
But, um, the, the, the candy store is still there.

205
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,180
I remember when that mall had a TV studio inside the mall.

206
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,820
Remember that they used to do the new news on channel three at the mall and they tried

207
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,740
to do like, they tried to do a today show thing where you could stand behind the wall

208
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,220
and, you know, try to be like, that was, that was the one.

209
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,660
And now it's like a Verizon store.

210
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,820
Like it's not even anything like what it was before my time.

211
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,220
Oh yeah.

212
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,820
No, I thought it was only about 10, 15 years ago that that was there, but I could be, I

213
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,380
don't know.

214
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,620
Anyway, malls, malls, good times.

215
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,100
All right.

216
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,380
Anyway, uh, let's get into the actual, where are the arcades?

217
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,140
Well, yeah.

218
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,380
Round one, new mall anchor store that seems to be, and you know what we were talking about

219
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,020
our malls dying or aren't they, aren't they dying?

220
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,180
It all depends on those anchor stores.

221
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,740
That is it.

222
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,140
Like, it seems to me like the malls live and die by those anchor stores and the things

223
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,620
that are in it.

224
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,900
And that's why like sunrise mall is that like surprised me about sunrise because they had

225
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,540
a Macy's.

226
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,060
Well, the best thing about, they have the split Macy's.

227
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,180
They're actually, you know what?

228
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,540
Those Macy's are actually better than any other one in the area because they're still

229
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,340
split.

230
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,460
So there's a larger selection there than there is in any other one in Alabama.

231
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,660
We didn't have Macy's in my town.

232
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,980
It's just real estate is expensive.

233
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,100
Yeah, no, it's true.

234
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,660
Yeah.

235
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,460
Dillard's and Parisian and gaffers.

236
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,940
A lot, a lot of them just started eating each other up.

237
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,460
So, cause my mom's favorite store was wine stocks and I think, I think Macy's bought

238
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,260
them at some point.

239
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,460
You know what store I miss Rob before we move on?

240
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:45,940
What?

241
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,700
I missed, uh, Woolworth's.

242
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,700
Oh yeah.

243
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,460
Those used to, well, there's, there's still a thing overseas.

244
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,780
There's still a thing overseas, but we, they're there.

245
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,140
I don't think they're even close to the same thing that they used to be.

246
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,900
No, they're not the, they're not the same thing.

247
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,580
But like, I remember for a long time, our Woolworth's had like a soda counter.

248
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,700
And, um, I, the thing I remember most about them is that they had the clothing racks that

249
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,220
were big and circular.

250
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,700
And when I was like six, I would just go hide in there.

251
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,980
And my mom would be like, Jamie, I know you're in one of these things.

252
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,500
You better come out by the count of three.

253
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,980
I'd come out by two.

254
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,900
Uh, Mike Defton chat says we have Woolworth's in Mexico.

255
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,940
They're different though.

256
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,820
It's one of those things where like somebody took the name and modernized it.

257
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,420
It's not, it's not what it used to be.

258
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,020
So, but anyway, all right.

259
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,340
I was going to say, even though they're tearing down sunrise mall, they're going to be keeping

260
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,460
the anchor stores anyways, and then converting like parking lot space in the condos or apartments

261
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,780
or something.

262
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,180
Yeah.

263
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,460
They're keeping one of the Macy's, I think, and the JC Penney's.

264
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,340
But yeah, like half the, like, remember the old cinemas?

265
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,860
If you walk down that side of the mall, it is all gone.

266
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,940
Like it is all just empty.

267
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,980
So it's like closed off.

268
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,420
Oh, is it now?

269
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,700
Oh yeah.

270
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,900
They have the whole side gate.

271
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,220
It wasn't last time I was there.

272
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,140
The movies there was with Monet.

273
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,740
Oh, that was a long time.

274
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,540
Oh boy.

275
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,100
We, we went to play a Pikmin at the mall and we walked around and it was, we were laughing

276
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,900
our asses off walking down the one side going, wow, there's literally nothing here.

277
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,700
But we, we just sprouted two, uh, big flowers or whatever they are in that game.

278
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,260
Anyway.

279
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,420
All right.

280
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,020
We got to get into other gaming news.

281
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,860
Let's get into the kickoff topic for tonight.

282
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,660
Sometimes, sometimes our age creeps through a little bit.

283
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,900
Oh, but I haven't said, of course we do tape live.

284
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,460
If you want to dive down in nostalgia rabbit hole with us, you sure can.

285
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,540
Every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks

286
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:45,780
network, twitch.tv slash V O G network, where we type tape, type, type, type live typing

287
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,860
of the dead type live right after the Bobby black Wolf show, except he's not here next

288
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,060
week, but that's okay.

289
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,980
We're still going to do our thing next week.

290
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,820
Um, Loki real quick, since we are taping live on Twitch, I meant to ask this video playing

291
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,460
behind you tonight.

292
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,940
Is that a tiny Tina Wonderland?

293
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,060
Yes, it is.

294
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,540
Aha.

295
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,180
I got it.

296
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,820
I got one.

297
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,700
All right.

298
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,500
Nice.

299
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,260
All right, let's get into, um, our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do a, well, this

300
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,140
is like a current thing going on, but I wanted to kind of ask about why is this so important,

301
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,860
but let's get into it.

302
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,380
Loki, what do we want to start talking off talking with horizon, uh, forbidden West had

303
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,580
some DLC come out.

304
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,900
Bernie shore is not that long ago and, um, it was good.

305
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,260
You know, the DLC was good.

306
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,660
Um, you might not know it if you look at Metacritic and some of the user scores.

307
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:47,300
The contention comes that there is a scene which alloy, um, kisses a woman names, uh,

308
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,260
sake Saka.

309
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,660
And so people like, Oh no, well, the gay I'm gonna, you know, I, I don't like it and I'm

310
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:04,420
going to review bomb it because I am homophobic and it's stupid, but that's, what's happening

311
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,780
is people are using it to wait, wait, wait.

312
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,660
I, I, this is a series a hundred percent serious question.

313
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,020
What kind of kiss is it?

314
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,460
Like, is it, is it a long kiss where a little, uh, like, is it that or is it just like a

315
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,620
pet?

316
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:22,980
Because I believe it is a fairly cultural norm, especially depending on what part of

317
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,460
the country you are for women to potentially like Peck each other is not like a big deal,

318
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:33,060
like at all, like, so is it a Peck kiss or is it a loving kiss?

319
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,820
Uh, I don't know.

320
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,540
I'm skipping through the video to figure that out.

321
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:39,860
Okay.

322
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:46,100
Maybe somebody in the chat does not appear to be like, I don't think it's any like long

323
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,820
kiss.

324
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,220
I don't know.

325
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,980
I know.

326
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,620
I know.

327
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,660
I know it's a weird question to ask, but it is a long romantic kiss, but it's not even

328
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,140
that long.

329
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,660
It's like, uh, like a minor, like it is a romantic kiss, but it's not like, uh, you

330
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,300
know, yeah, it's a romantic kiss, I guess.

331
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,620
Okay.

332
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,180
Okay.

333
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,300
Why should people care?

334
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:07,860
Yeah, no.

335
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,020
And I, I was going to get to that is like, it really shouldn't matter, but I was more

336
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,900
going to go down the rabbit hole of like, wow, these snowflakes are really sensitive

337
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,620
if it was going to be just like a little bit of a pack, you know?

338
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,460
So, uh, but you're right.

339
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,460
It shouldn't, it shouldn't matter what the type of kiss is.

340
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,580
People are pushing the gay agenda on them.

341
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,180
Like, Oh my God, people.

342
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,540
Like, it's just ridiculous.

343
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:33,860
Right.

344
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,940
But I think that they didn't know because there wasn't like a warning on the DLC or

345
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,180
something.

346
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,500
Like you shouldn't need a warning.

347
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,500
It's not, I understand that you're preaching to the choir.

348
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,580
We're standing here behind you going, amen, amen.

349
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,940
It's it's, you know?

350
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,660
Yeah.

351
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,620
It's just dumb.

352
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,180
So yeah.

353
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,820
So they're, they are review bombing it saying that, you know, uh, homosexuals are putting

354
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,740
a dirty agenda and sabotage what could have been a beautiful story.

355
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,420
Blah, blah, blah.

356
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,340
Guerrilla games, retcon the main character for LG LGBTQ nonsense.

357
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,740
Um, you know, that kind of stuff.

358
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,700
It's just dumb.

359
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:12,900
What?

360
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,420
So what is the homosexual agenda?

361
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,540
Like I, I've never, I thought it was just going to brunch on Sunday.

362
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:19,780
I know.

363
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,460
I don't expect anyone here to actually be able to answer that, but it's that, it's that

364
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,740
whole thing of like, wait a minute.

365
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,220
When you say they're pushing the homosexual agenda, literally, what is that?

366
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,580
Because I can stay as a long time homosexual.

367
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,300
My agenda is like, did we get the cats enough food?

368
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,180
Are brunch plans still on for Sunday?

369
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,500
Did I leave the gas on?

370
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,180
It's the straight men's fear that gay men are going to look at them the way they look

371
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,980
at women.

372
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,820
No, I don't think it's even that necessarily.

373
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,300
Maybe partly that, but what it is is that they feel that being gay is a choice.

374
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,140
It is not the way you're born.

375
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,820
It is just a choice.

376
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:07,380
And that because it's a choice, that it is that this influence and normalization of this

377
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,100
stuff is going to turn straight people gay, like their children gay.

378
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:17,540
That's why that they're afraid of the whole like trans like education and stuff like that

379
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,340
and gender affirming care is because they feel that people talking about stuff is going

380
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,740
to open their kids eyes into changing genders or something like that.

381
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,780
It's stupid.

382
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,020
It's because they're afraid they're going to be, they're going to learn how wrong they

383
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,500
were.

384
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,980
It's because the big bad men on TV tell them that they should be afraid of this.

385
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,220
And that's why those people have, you know, billion dollar lawsuits and get fired from

386
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,940
their stations.

387
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,140
So whatever.

388
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,660
No, I, I get it.

389
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,420
Cause I've heard that before the whole, like, Oh, they're trying to convert kids.

390
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:55,380
And it's like, I, I have, what, in what universe does that make sense?

391
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,660
Why, why do I want to sit here and recruit?

392
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:04,020
Like I, for a multitude of reasons, that is just like wrong.

393
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,980
Like it's being gay with pedophilia, which I can't stand that.

394
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:14,420
Oh, you want to set me off and you want me to go zero to bitch in five seconds, do that

395
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:14,900
equation.

396
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,780
Cause that pisses me off.

397
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,420
Sorry, Jamie.

398
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:23,700
People are, people are using the, the larger numbers of, I guess, known LGBTQ plus people

399
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,620
in the world to, to support their stupid theory.

400
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,540
When all it is is that people are less afraid and are more public.

401
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,500
And, and they, they want, there's, there's a certain mindset that goes in a group that

402
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,100
is the majority.

403
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,140
And this is psychology.

404
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,420
Now this is psychology.

405
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:51,700
They start seeing themselves becoming outnumbered and fear they're becoming the minority and

406
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,620
that they're going to lose their social power.

407
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:02,180
And so the people with the, I would say most amount of influence in that particular circle

408
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:08,420
are going to try to spread whatever information that they need to, to keep more of the quote

409
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,980
majority on their side, to keep perpetrating the way things are.

410
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,900
They want the status quo thing is status quo already changed and they just didn't.

411
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,180
And they just are now noticing.

412
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,380
Yeah.

413
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,700
All right.

414
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,900
Anyway, I feel like we could, we're appreciative of the choir.

415
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,060
I feel like if you've gotten this far in the podcast, you, you know how we feel on this

416
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,540
topic.

417
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,660
And if you disagree, I don't know what to tell you at this point.

418
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,460
So that all being said, there's a kind of another part to this that Metacritic now is

419
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,660
having to respond to, right?

420
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,540
They've responded to says Metacritic is aware of the abusive and disrespectful reviews of

421
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,780
Horizon Forbidden West burning chores.

422
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,340
We have a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of service.

423
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,900
Our teams review each and every report of abuse, including, but not limited to racist,

424
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,340
sexist, homophobic insults to other users, et cetera.

425
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,380
If violations occur, the reviews are removed.

426
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,420
We are currently evolving our process and tools to introduce stricter moderation in the

427
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,620
coming months.

428
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,460
So yeah, it sucks that they're doing this.

429
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,180
I mean, honestly, people should be complaining about other games like Star Wars for, you

430
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,420
know, quality issues, not necessarily.

431
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:23,780
You may remember not even that long ago, people were upset that alloy had facial hair because

432
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,100
she's a human woman, allegedly human, human looking.

433
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,500
And and guess what?

434
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,020
Women have hair on their face.

435
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,580
Oh my God, it's a shock.

436
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,620
Like these are there are women who have full beards.

437
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,580
It's just it's it's ridiculous.

438
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,940
Yeah, that's actually a medical condition, though.

439
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
It's yeah.

440
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,660
So let me ask this question.

441
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,260
Here's here's here's where I find myself when I see a story about these types of review

442
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,660
bombings.

443
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,500
And I don't I don't want to, like, belittle the situation or anything, because I understand

444
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,060
like this is messed up with these review bombers are doing.

445
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,580
And I am glad that Metacritic is taking steps to address and try to weed out some of this,

446
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,940
you know, systematic bullshit that seems to come up every time.

447
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,380
But it leads me back to this point.

448
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,660
Why do why do Metacritic user reviews fucking matter in the first place?

449
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,300
I have never in my life let that website or any like it.

450
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,140
This isn't me picking on Metacritic.

451
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,980
It's me picking on these type of, you know, hive mind user review site, reading the comment

452
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,340
type of places.

453
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,180
I have never let those influence my decision.

454
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:40,420
Now I'm going to quantify that and say, I will listen to user reviews from trusted friends

455
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,940
on social media, on, you know, Twitter when I'm feeling okay about Twitter or Facebook

456
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,020
or Instagram or whatever, you know, I guess blue sky.

457
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,700
Now I can throw in the conversation or any of that stuff.

458
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,420
I trust I trust users that I know.

459
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,900
And I've, I've had like a friendship with or Twitch streamers is actually, well, if

460
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,100
we're going to talk about video games, I absolutely make informed decisions from Twitch streamers.

461
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,740
I like, and even random, like if I'm on the fence about a game, like, Oh, am I finally

462
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,500
going to suck it up and buy stranger paradise, finally found fantasy origin.

463
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,700
It's because I'm watching other streamers play it and decide, or, you know, one of my

464
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,180
closest friends is in my ear going, it's $20.

465
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,820
Rob is $20.

466
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,020
Rob, you said you buy it was $20 and I'll let you all guess who it is.

467
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,660
It's $20.

468
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,220
It's $20.

469
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,540
Go get it.

470
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:27,940
Go get it.

471
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,500
It's $20.

472
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,460
And then finally I buy the game based on those.

473
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,860
Does it squish and end with aim?

474
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,420
Yes.

475
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,580
Because he has a pain in my ear all of the time.

476
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,020
He's a pusher.

477
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,460
Yes.

478
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:48,820
But anyway, um, my point still stands since when, and let me ask this question.

479
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,180
I opened this to chat.

480
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,780
I opened the, Oh, Shane's ears are burning.

481
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,820
I opened this to chat.

482
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,820
I opened this to anybody.

483
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,060
Actually, I opened this up specifically to Shane and invite him to answer this question.

484
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:07,620
Do Metacritic or, uh, sites like it, do these reviews scores matter to you?

485
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,180
I would say it, they don't necessarily like the user reviews don't matter too much to

486
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,500
me.

487
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,020
Like sometimes it's good to get like here, like what users think about that.

488
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,100
It's more useful, I think for aggregating, like actual reviews for something.

489
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,980
So it makes it a little bit faster to like find that kind of stuff.

490
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,300
But yeah, user reviews are pretty much trash because it's either gonna be a 10 or a zero.

491
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,100
And it, it really doesn't matter what it is.

492
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,380
Pro reviews don't matter to me either.

493
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,980
I mean, we grew up in the age of, you know, uh, Cisco and Ebert and they've been so wrong.

494
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,480
Yeah.

495
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:50,500
I want to look to the people who I know who have similar, um, taste to me, what they say.

496
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:50,820
Yeah.

497
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,060
That's gonna weigh most of all.

498
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,500
I can't say I never look at pro reviews because maybe if I'm kind of on the fence, I'll kind

499
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:04,660
of go, all right, what's kind of like the general consensus from professionals, but

500
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,420
I never go to what's the general consensus from the peanut gallery.

501
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:17,060
I'll look for, uh, articles of criticism from people that I know are very even with their

502
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,020
criticism.

503
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,940
Cause you know, another one of my little catch phrases is be critical of what you love.

504
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:30,180
And I like when people say, start off, I am a fan of this game, but here are the problems

505
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,180
or here's what could be better.

506
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,620
And I feel very, I like when someone who loves what they're doing, like for example, I love

507
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,260
Xanadu, but it's not a great movie.

508
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,580
And I can tell you why, you know, but I still love it.

509
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:46,980
Yeah.

510
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,260
You know, that, that my criticism is coming from a place of love.

511
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,660
Absolutely.

512
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,860
There's plenty of movies like that where I can go, I absolutely understand why people

513
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,460
hate this movie, but you know what?

514
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,740
This is my moment.

515
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,340
This is my, this is my thing.

516
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:58,900
I get it.

517
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,300
I get it.

518
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,180
Looking at chat, you got a lot of comments in chat.

519
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,740
Pod Culture says, I look more at what you guys have to say TBH.

520
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,060
Well, that's very, that's very kind and very flattering.

521
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,900
And we appreciate that platform.

522
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,580
You know, it's a tiny platform.

523
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,460
It's one little two by four piece of plywood that we get to stand on here at OLR.

524
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
But we appreciate those of you that do.

525
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,340
But I would file us in that same bucket of Twitch streamers and, you know, like your,

526
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:30,020
your friends basically on these types of platforms that, you know, get you to see games you might

527
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,220
not have seen otherwise.

528
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,100
I'm fond of the phrase that opinions are like assholes.

529
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
They should only come out when people want to see them.

530
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,860
Ooh, this is, this is something where we should clip this because Shane says, I shockingly

531
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,300
think Rob hit it on the head.

532
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,380
Well, time, time stamp date that one, quote it, put it on the back of the box.

533
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,780
Friends and Twitch are what helped me decide, or I'll go in blind because of previews or

534
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,060
my own opinions.

535
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,460
So, but yeah, Rob, you're welcome.

536
00:28:59,460 --> 00:28:59,860
Thank you.

537
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,260
Thank you.

538
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,580
Could you?

539
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:00,820
Yes.

540
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,740
I'd like to actually post that on social media later.

541
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:10,660
Let's see, fifth dream in chat says I'm likely to check out a free to play MMO.

542
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,460
A streamer I like is playing because there's no risk, but I generally know what I will

543
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,620
like.

544
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,940
That's also a very good point about like free to play when the, when the cost is free, like

545
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,580
actually nothing will win me over more than a really good demo.

546
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,940
So as much as I'm joking about Shane and the $20 tag on this stranger paradise PlayStation

547
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,500
four that I keep holding up, by the way, it's PlayStation four because it has free upgrade

548
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,340
to PS five and PS five was sold out.

549
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,980
Um, but, uh, my point is it actually was the demo for this game that made me pay attention

550
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,940
and go, huh?

551
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,260
I liked that a lot more than I thought I would.

552
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,620
And on the flip side, there's been a meme here at VOG network on our little two by four

553
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,740
piece of plywood platform.

554
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,380
We've had, there's been a meme here about the game Nino Cooney that dates back what

555
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,980
like fucking like 13 years.

556
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,780
How old is that game?

557
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,460
It could probably be a classic game of the week at this point.

558
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,820
It's at least 10 years old at this point.

559
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:09,700
That game had a terrible demo because it didn't set things up and really explain what you

560
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
were trying to do correctly.

561
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,060
And it left a bad taste in your mouth because it was really hard to kind of get through

562
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,780
the demo.

563
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,100
And so it made people actively not want to buy that game.

564
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:28,420
So anyway, a demo is, I think the demos even more than anything else, I've said the biggest

565
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,700
thing that will influence my opinion, because it kind of goes back to what Fifth Dream had

566
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,420
said earlier.

567
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,860
It's basically a free opportunity to look at it, you know, a free opportunity to test

568
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,740
it out or what have you.

569
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:51,060
So if we're all sitting here going, we don't care what these folks in the peanut gallery

570
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,020
have to say, then why are company, why do companies seem to care?

571
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,860
They don't know how to think for themselves.

572
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,100
I mean, the people who are gathering the data are corporate level.

573
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,740
They're not the people that are actually playing the games.

574
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,620
All they care about is what a number is.

575
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:18,420
And if they see, oh, X number of consumers say this, that's all they're looking at.

576
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,980
They're not looking at the content of it.

577
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:28,500
You know, I'm very lucky that the company that I work for has a really good feedback

578
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,540
page with very specific things that they ask for.

579
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,100
What's wrong?

580
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,820
What's your ideas?

581
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,620
What's this?

582
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,220
And I think that video game companies would benefit from something like that, where people

583
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,180
can actually leave structured feedback with a form.

584
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,700
Why do you feel this way?

585
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,300
What is the issue with this?

586
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,980
On what ranking would you give this aspect of the game?

587
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,220
Right.

588
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,740
Instead of just a 200 character tweet where people say whatever they want, which isn't

589
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,860
always glamorous.

590
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,900
Yeah, I get it.

591
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,540
I get it.

592
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:55,860
Exactly.

593
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,980
But they forget exactly what, you know, the.

594
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,900
What's the word I'm thinking of?

595
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,540
What?

596
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:12,180
How the population acts, because I'm sorry, people will flock.

597
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:17,380
It's a natural thing that no one wants to be publicly wrong.

598
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,340
It takes, I think, a strong individual to be able to offer a differing opinion and back

599
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,900
it up.

600
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,060
Yeah, but so the majority of people, they don't want to be that that nail that gets

601
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,620
hammered down.

602
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,020
They want to go with the crowd and be cool.

603
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,300
So you're not always getting an honest opinion out there.

604
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,420
You're getting a bandwagon.

605
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,380
Bobby Blackwolf with some receipts and chat, by the way, stating that Nino Cooney was released

606
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,700
in America in January 2013.

607
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,060
So it just recently became eligible as a classic game by those standards.

608
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,820
But Bobby does go on to point out that was just like the first US game.

609
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,940
There were some Japan only titles in the first Nino Cooney game ever came out in 2010.

610
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,140
So if it felt like the series is a little older, that might be why.

611
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,820
So, yeah, you know, on the whole subject of, you know, user reviews, I think back to a

612
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,780
company we talked a lot about last week, and that's Niantic.

613
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,020
And I'm not going to retread that whole ground tonight, but I do remember with a game of

614
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,180
theirs, I've played a lot more Ingress.

615
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,180
When they went from some of you may or may not know this, they actually released a whole

616
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,780
new client for Ingress.

617
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,660
So imagine they took like Pokemon Go and release like a complete new version of it that just

618
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,860
ran on the same back end.

619
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,340
That's what they did with Ingress at one point.

620
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,380
So there was what they called Ingress scanner redacted or basically original vanilla Ingress.

621
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,140
And then they released Ingress Prime.

622
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,260
And then at some point they turned off the original Ingress client because they wanted

623
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,780
people to move to Prime.

624
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,820
And this is when it started getting review bombed like crazy because change is scary.

625
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,140
People liked what they liked in the original scanner and the new scanner could sometimes

626
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,900
be a little bit more of a resource hog.

627
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,460
It wasn't optimized as good at this point.

628
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,140
You know, it was, I think there was one or two features it was still kind of missing

629
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,700
and didn't have true parity with the original client with.

630
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,300
So it got review bombed to hell.

631
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:09,220
And I remember the company seemed to actually kind of take it personally in a way.

632
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,020
A year later when they fixed a lot of issues and started rolling new things out and kind

633
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,100
of saying like, here's why Ingress Prime.

634
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,780
I remember Niantic posting in some of their like Ingress channels, hey, if you feel different

635
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,060
about Prime now than you did a year ago, could you go back and update your reviews in Google

636
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,180
Play Store and iTunes?

637
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,580
Like this was legit an ass that the company had.

638
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,460
Can you go update your reviews if you don't hate us anymore?

639
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:40,420
So it just, it was, and it struck me as odd because I was like, damn, the user reviews

640
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,860
matter that much.

641
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,060
But I suppose, and I don't know, I don't want to go too far down this.

642
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:53,940
I suppose when we talk about an app store, perhaps that could influence the display on

643
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
searches and rankings and things like that.

644
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,500
Perhaps that is a factor I'm not thinking about.

645
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:06,260
Um, but it just strikes me as a weird ask because yeah, user reviews should matter,

646
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,980
right?

647
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,540
It's weird.

648
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,420
Anyway, anything else you want to say on this?

649
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,700
Anyone?

650
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,020
No, I don't know if there's many companies outside of like the app stuff.

651
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:27,140
Like I can't imagine that companies are still using Metacritic as like a metric for bonuses

652
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,620
and stuff.

653
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,140
Oh yeah, I've heard that.

654
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:36,260
Considering like how, you know, uh, Star Wars, how, you know, it seems that the companies

655
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,500
are very comfortable with them shipping games that are not in working condition when they

656
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,460
get shipped out.

657
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,300
Yeah, I was gonna say the incentive should be tied around bug reports, although to be

658
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,780
fair before somebody corrects me on it, yes, I get it.

659
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,580
Like oftentimes it's the publisher's fault, not the developer that the game releases with

660
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,500
bugs in it because there's aggressive time deal, right?

661
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:05,220
So I do understand, but yeah, to Loki's point, I do wish the incentives were more tied around

662
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,420
that type of quality than just, you know, are the, you know, professional reviewers

663
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,260
going to get it or not what you're doing.

664
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,260
Even though I don't think this game, again, holding this up because I've done it four

665
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,300
times now, I don't think this game was particularly strongly reviewed, but the people that seemed

666
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,340
I mean, maybe like 75 or 80, which isn't bad.

667
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,540
It just is in that weird realm of like, it's all right.

668
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,820
But like the people that I know that have like really played and spent time with this

669
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,420
game really seem to love it.

670
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,180
So it's just, it's interesting.

671
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,220
But I think a lot of Team Ninja games kind of go that way.

672
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Like, yeah, even think about Metroid Other M, Metroid Other M probably landed in that

673
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,460
same sort of nebulous, it's all right kind of category.

674
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,780
But the people that liked that game really liked that game.

675
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,420
The people that hate that game really hate that game, but it's, it's kind of interesting.

676
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,300
Deft in Chat says sucks that the same didn't happen with Pokemon Go Niantic asking the

677
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,740
community for something.

678
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:07,620
Well, if the track record says anything to me, then I would say if you want Niantic to

679
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:14,020
hashtag hear us Niantic actively, one of the easiest things you could do to get noticed

680
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:20,260
is start review bombing it on these stores, which is wild that I'm sitting here saying

681
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,380
that on one hand, and on the other hand, going these reviews shouldn't matter.

682
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,420
But I just told you a story where it clearly did to the publisher review bombing it for

683
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,300
like, and this is this is this one specific circumstances function, not like because,

684
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,020
oh, I'm a racist, or I'm homophobic.

685
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,460
And I Oh, yeah, super, super different.

686
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,820
Like Mike, my faith tells me that this is wrong.

687
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,500
And so therefore, you're wrong for putting it in my game.

688
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,020
My, my, my one star review would say Niantic made a promise to the player base that they

689
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,060
did not follow through on.

690
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,340
Yeah, that's it.

691
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,340
That would be that would be the extent of my one star review on Pokemon Go.

692
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,780
I don't need to write a novel.

693
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,820
I don't need I'm just gonna keep it short and sweet Niantic did not follow through on

694
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,180
a promise they made to their player base.

695
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:14,740
So anyway, that all being said, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things

696
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,900
that have brought us joy the five stars of our gaming week.

697
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,940
Let's go to Dark Sakura.

698
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,820
How was your gaming week?

699
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,980
It was pretty good.

700
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,700
I beat Marvel's Midnight Suns last night.

701
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,060
And well, apparently people want to see me play that.

702
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,580
So retro night is under construction.

703
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:39,380
And I'm going to be doing another playthrough of Midnight Suns on my Saturday streaming.

704
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,740
When you say another playthrough, are you doing anything to change it?

705
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,020
I don't know that game very well.

706
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:45,780
New Game Plus.

707
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,260
Okay.

708
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,780
No, I haven't really noticed like major differences yet, except I've got like,

709
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,660
all the cosmetics are unlocked for me to buy that I had earned before,

710
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,780
but I have to buy them again.

711
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,260
I started with a bunch of gloss, which is the money.

712
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:04,260
So and I can go ahead and invest stuff in characters I don't have yet.

713
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:14,420
So and actually, what was weird is that like, for example, when you want Morbius in,

714
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,780
you know, he's a DLC, you have to go do his mission to recruit him.

715
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,500
He was just hanging out there.

716
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,340
Like, dude, why are you?

717
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,020
I'm the brand new hunter.

718
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,540
Why are you in my house?

719
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,420
And why are you kind of hot?

720
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,020
Anyway, I play Beatles pinball.

721
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,180
We're actually selling Medieval Madness.

722
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:38,680
Oh, wow.

723
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,740
To pay for Weird Al.

724
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,660
Fair.

725
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,060
And so we'll have it for about another month.

726
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,500
It's the time to play it.

727
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,780
I'm playing my wordscapes.

728
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,140
Definitely playing Dead by Daylight.

729
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,180
I got three more adepts last week on Killer.

730
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,700
I got Legion, finally.

731
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:11,540
I got Myers, who I very much suck at, but I figured a strategy.

732
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:19,060
Do RPD with the hair tuft, the iridescent one that keeps you in tier three.

733
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,620
And just walk around stabbing people.

734
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,340
That's really it.

735
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:29,780
And I got Hag, even with the changes to her mechanics.

736
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,060
So I'm getting a little bit further on finishing out my adepts.

737
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:39,780
I still haven't played, like, Wesker or the Knight or our Skull Merchant.

738
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,500
So maybe I'll have to do that.

739
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,860
I'm just kind of reluctant.

740
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:53,460
And a game that I ordered has arrived, Osmond, which I've done as a classic game of the week.

741
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,140
It's the spiritual sequel to Strider.

742
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:00,980
Oh, yeah.

743
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,820
And then I got Dissidia Final Fantasy NX.

744
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,660
I actually didn't hear that one, but it was like $5.

745
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,040
So I bought it.

746
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,820
So, yeah.

747
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,460
I don't remember what was special about NX.

748
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,780
Dissidia was weird to me, but I probably didn't give it enough of a chance, to be honest.

749
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,380
Well, I just had a bunch of sales, so I just went for it.

750
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,620
But if anyone likes Strider, I absolutely suggest getting Osmond.

751
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,780
It's definitely the same sort of game, same creator, everything.

752
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,900
It was something else.

753
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,460
Oh, yeah, I played some World Cup soccer because, you know, that's my baby.

754
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,140
Nice.

755
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,260
All right, I'm done.

756
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:42,740
All right.

757
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,460
Loki, we'll go to you.

758
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,340
How was your gaming week?

759
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,500
I played a few things.

760
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,220
Actually, funny enough, I played some games that were integrated in the Discord.

761
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:56,100
So we were messing with some of those in our community chat for the Channel 64 SMP.

762
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,500
So what was it?

763
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,220
Gardic Phone, which is kind of a...

764
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,180
Love Gardic Phone.

765
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,940
Yeah, they play that on Twitch all the time, yeah.

766
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,020
Gardic Phone, was it Know What I Meme, which is kind of funny.

767
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,420
That one's like Apples to Apples, but with memes.

768
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:15,780
OK.

769
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,020
And then Putt Party, which is just a miniature golf game.

770
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,140
I love miniature golf games, so that was fun.

771
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,020
Let's play that.

772
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,340
And then what else?

773
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,220
Playing another game.

774
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,180
It was another like card game, board game thing.

775
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,260
I don't remember what it was called, though.

776
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,060
But it was interesting and mostly Minecraft.

777
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,420
I've been playing lots of Minecraft.

778
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,140
I posted earlier.

779
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,100
I finally passed a thousand subs, which is great.

780
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:53,220
One step closer to getting monetized as the another 2000 watch hours within a year.

781
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,700
So that's a little hard because it goes down every single day.

782
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,540
Considering that, you know, a year ago, people watched my content and, you know,

783
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,500
we have to make sure that there's more content for them to watch and get that out those hours up.

784
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,420
So you have to do that.

785
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,100
And then I've been working on a lot for this next episode.

786
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,660
Facts so much so that I'm probably going to have to cut it in two because there's too much

787
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,740
too much for the episode.

788
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,220
But I've already got there's another big

789
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,300
Mega Man enemy build.

790
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,580
Oh, yeah, the big one.

791
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:26,900
Good.

792
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,220
So and it's fantastic looking.

793
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:37,780
I've got more big structures for another robot masters area that look really cool and

794
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,220
lots of like terraforming and stuff in that area.

795
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,220
So I'm probably going to do half of that area because it's actually like a third of the

796
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,420
the entire base area.

797
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,260
So like, I can't do that all in one episode.

798
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,300
That'd be just ridiculous.

799
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:55,060
So I'm going to cut in two and then but yeah, there will be a lot of content just there.

800
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,140
So I'm very excited to get that done.

801
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,780
Hopefully this week I wanted to get done this weekend.

802
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,300
There's no way that was going to happen.

803
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,460
All right, I understand.

804
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:11,300
OK, my gaming week, some of the same old stuff playing a little more Final Fantasy 14.

805
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,060
I played a little bit of Dead by Daylight.

806
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,660
I think I even did like two matches with Jamie at very randomly at one point during the week.

807
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,300
I can remember.

808
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,220
Yeah, one was really short and stinky.

809
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,500
Yeah, I had a really fun one.

810
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,220
Yeah, yeah.

811
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,820
So but I even did some killer matches.

812
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,420
I played my first Wesker game ever.

813
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,460
Oh, it did not go well.

814
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,380
I'm not good at zipping across.

815
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,700
I was not connecting with survivors.

816
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,620
It just takes a little time to get used to, I'm sure.

817
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,900
Seven seconds is all I have to play with you.

818
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,220
Yeah.

819
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:40,740
So I just I went back to Miss Plague because her and the throw in the vomit and all that,

820
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,700
that I can do that.

821
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,220
Mommy, mommy.

822
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,300
It breaks a lot.

823
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,900
The reason why I like Plague is it's a different meta for the survivors than what they're usually

824
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:54,820
prepared for, especially right now, a lot of big healing builds.

825
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,460
And it's like with Plague, a lot of that goes out the window.

826
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,260
Like and when I like to because, you know, I like to play my immersive Lisa, where I

827
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,340
go as a nurse and I take healing stuff.

828
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,780
So I'll take like Botany, the Yoichi perk that shows where you are sometimes will make

829
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,220
it take a lot of the healing perks and do my immersive nurse.

830
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,060
And when I go up against a plague, I'm like, I'm useless.

831
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:22,180
I'm literally I literally can't do anything in this fight because long story short, I

832
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,460
used to be a plague main.

833
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,340
So yeah.

834
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,300
And for those who don't follow the game, how can I explain this succinctly?

835
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,260
The plague has a mechanic where she vomits on you.

836
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,820
And so if you've been vomited on, you can't heal because you still have vomit.

837
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,700
Basically, you have to cleanse the vomit and you get you get a free heal when you do that.

838
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,180
Yes.

839
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:40,900
Yes.

840
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:46,100
So but after after you cleanse, though, the pool that you cleanse in turns red and then

841
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,780
she can wash in it or something and we get what we call danger puke.

842
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,420
Yeah.

843
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:50,980
Yeah.

844
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,820
And if it doesn't make you sick, but but it counts as a hit.

845
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,220
Yes.

846
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,540
Long distance hits and she's tall.

847
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,260
She's taller than most than most of the the other killers.

848
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:02,760
Yeah.

849
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:06,660
Which was hard for me to learn her because I'm better with the shorter people.

850
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,020
I think only Nemesis is about as tall, to be honest.

851
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,660
So yeah.

852
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,300
So anyway, other games I've played this week.

853
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,260
So I've spent most of my gaming week actually on Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster.

854
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,020
I played the first game.

855
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,500
I actually streamed the entirety of that game.

856
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,700
I did like two hours on Monday and then I did like six hours, maybe five and a half on Friday.

857
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,940
I played that entire game on stream start to finish.

858
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,860
And yeah, I had a good time playing it.

859
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,540
I enjoyed the pixel remasters.

860
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,620
I think the boosting that they put in the game was great because you can do four times

861
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,220
experience and four times Gil and it just takes the grind completely out.

862
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,060
It also takes the challenge completely out.

863
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:51,460
So if you're somebody like me who just kind of wants to go down memory lane and revisit

864
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,380
this classic game you really like, then I think the boosting is a great way to do it.

865
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,780
But like if it's your very first time playing it and you're about to form your entire impression

866
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,660
of Final Fantasy based on that, I think you need to be very aware if you're going to boost

867
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,660
that you are boosting and the game was not originally designed in the way you're about

868
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,300
to play it because I will tell you because of that, nothing gave me a challenge in that

869
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,460
game until the very last boss.

870
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:22,100
I think the typical level to be when you beat the original Final Fantasy is around 45 or

871
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,980
50.

872
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,500
I was level 69.

873
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,740
Yes, I was.

874
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,240
Yes.

875
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,220
When I fought Chaos and that was well, because of the way things are going on.

876
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,860
So you can also turn the encounters on and off.

877
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:42,820
And so when I hit 69, I turned off the encounters so that I could beat Chaos at level 69.

878
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,220
So because I was in the last dungeon already when that happened.

879
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,140
So Bobby says the original NES version had a level 50 cap.

880
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,340
Oh, I didn't even realize that.

881
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,340
I always thought I'd let you go to 99.

882
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,180
When I play my classic RPGs, because I've actually played most of them, I play with,

883
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,780
you know, the codes on.

884
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,500
But it's the same thing.

885
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,380
It's still, you know, it still took me a good seven hours to play through it.

886
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,140
I could have probably, you know, because Shane kept telling me throughout the stream, just

887
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:12,340
turn the encounters off, just turn the encounters off and just fight the monsters and treasure

888
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:12,660
chests.

889
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,460
You'll be fine.

890
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,740
But I was like, I want to try to fill up the bestiary.

891
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,860
I want to try to have some monsters I get to fight and do that thing.

892
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,260
And so, you know, I did still leave on random encounters for most of it.

893
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,340
There was a point probably when I got to about the fourth hour on the second stream, I was

894
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,780
like, all right, if I keep seeing the same things over and over on a floor, I'm going

895
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,060
to turn off the encounters and just get through the floor and then go to the next floor.

896
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,900
So it helped the second half of the game move a little quicker than the first half.

897
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,740
But yeah, I had a good time with it.

898
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,780
And if you enjoy the classic Final Fantasy games or you're just curious about them, I

899
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,140
think the pixel remasters are great.

900
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,540
I'm looking forward to playing more of them.

901
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:52,740
I'm probably going to get sidetracked now that I picked up Stranger in Paradise.

902
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:58,500
But because Stranger in Paradise ties into the original Final Fantasy, now seems like

903
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,780
a good time to play it.

904
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,620
So I'm going to start streaming that next week, probably Tuesday.

905
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,100
I just had a crazy random thought.

906
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:12,900
What if they did Final Fantasy 7 pixel remaster and actually released it as a pixel-based

907
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,220
game?

908
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,340
Well, you know, they had the final, you know, the Chinese bootleg aside, because somebody

909
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,700
will say they did that.

910
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,900
That was a Chinese bootleg.

911
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:27,300
But the other thing that was official was there was a Final Fantasy 15, was it Pocket

912
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,260
Edition, I think it was called, where they took Final Fantasy 15 and made it a more traditional

913
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,300
Final Fantasy game.

914
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,780
And so they did have that.

915
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,620
So I could see something like that happening with Final Fantasy 7 at some point.

916
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,780
But they're more focused on these remake and rebirth series right now.

917
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,020
But it could make an interesting tie-in at some point.

918
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:52,660
So anyway, one other game that I played this week.

919
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,700
This is very random.

920
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,500
You ready for this?

921
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,260
I randomly decided to pick up.

922
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,300
Here we go again.

923
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,780
I played Skyrim a little bit because here's why.

924
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:08,420
Because I didn't realize that at some point in the last year, the Special Edition finally

925
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,460
went on Game Pass.

926
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:13,380
Because when that first came out, they didn't put it on Game Pass right away.

927
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:18,260
It was only the original Skyrim Edition you could do.

928
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,540
So I wanted to see like the 4K Pretty Pretty Edition, because you might remember I bought

929
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,900
this computer a year ago.

930
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,660
I feel like when I bought this computer, I wanted to put Skyrim on it, but they didn't

931
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:31,620
have, you couldn't get the Special Edition yet in Game Pass.

932
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,660
So at some point, they put that on Game Pass and I noticed it.

933
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,700
I was like, oh, I want to try the pretty 4K version of Skyrim.

934
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,420
And I've been playing it and it is pretty and 4K and it's been fun.

935
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:48,500
I turned the difficulty down to Bobby Black Wolf mode just so I could have fun playing

936
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:48,900
it.

937
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,940
And I'm just like, I want to set everything on fire.

938
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,220
No, it's electricity.

939
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,300
I'm going to zap everything with a lightning bolt.

940
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,980
And so that's just what I've been doing in Skyrim.

941
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,620
Hello, monster, and just zapping everything with lightning.

942
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,100
So that's and that's not usually how I play those games.

943
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,180
I'm almost always a sword and shield person.

944
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,900
So it's kind of fun being a little bit more magicky.

945
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,980
That's been my gaming week, pretty much Pixel Remasters and Skyrim.

946
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,780
So, all right, we got some more gaming news to get into.

947
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,740
So let's get to it and talk about what is going on in gaming.

948
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,660
I do it at just quick programming note.

949
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,820
Bobby won't be here next week, but we will be.

950
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,020
So if you are going to listen live on Sunday night, just be aware you're not going to hear

951
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,900
Bobby beforehand.

952
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,100
So you might be like, what happened?

953
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,460
Did things get canceled tonight?

954
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,780
Bobby's got a conflict, but we will be here next week for sure.

955
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,620
Also, shout out to Bobby.

956
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,540
I'm sure many of you already listen to his show.

957
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:47,060
If you are not already aware, he will be doing some announcing at Summer Games Done Quick,

958
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:51,780
which is going to be live and in person in a couple of weeks up in Minneapolis, I think,

959
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,500
or that area.

960
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:57,060
So it's not by the Mall of America like it was last time.

961
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,380
I think he says in downtown Minneapolis this time.

962
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:04,740
So regardless of those types of organizational things, Bobby's going to be one of the announcers.

963
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:10,660
But it's also a great charity event that brings a lot of the world's best speedrunners together.

964
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,100
And it's a lot of fun to watch.

965
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,180
So check that out.

966
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,540
That's coming up in a couple of weeks.

967
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,300
Yeah.

968
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,260
And Bobby clarifies, yes, it's downtown this time, but the train goes to the Mall of America.

969
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,100
So that's coming up for Bobby in a few weeks.

970
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,700
We won't be here on May 21st.

971
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,580
And I know that is a very random night to be off.

972
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,900
It's a day job conflict for me.

973
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,620
I can't be here.

974
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,060
The job that pays the bills has to come first.

975
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,500
And it's as simple as that.

976
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:48,100
So all right, let's move on and get into some news.

977
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,460
And I'll start off with Loki.

978
00:52:50,420 --> 00:53:02,980
Yeah, so the UK has blocked the Microsoft Activision acquisition deal, and the CMA basically

979
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:11,220
cited that the merger would result in them dominating the cloud gaming space because

980
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,020
Game Pass is doing pretty well and all that stuff.

981
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:18,180
They said, We have concluded that the merger would result in the most powerful operator

982
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:23,060
in the fast developing market for cloud gaming, with the current market share of 60 to 70%

983
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:28,820
acquiring a portfolio of world leading games with the incentive to withhold those games

984
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:36,340
from competitors and substantially weaken competition in this important growing market.

985
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:42,180
Which is weird because they have been reaching out to other cloud gaming services to say,

986
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,820
hey, we'll put Call of Duty on there for 10 years, at least.

987
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,660
I will sign that deal.

988
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:53,540
So I'm not really sure where they're saying that they're going to like hurt cloud gaming

989
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:53,780
and stuff.

990
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:58,580
And I'm also not really sure how much of like Call of Duty sales is actually cloud gaming

991
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,940
either, which is kind of interesting.

992
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,060
So when you get into the nuts and bolts of the whole argument, people have been talking

993
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,020
about this in our Discord.

994
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,420
And if you want to see more over at vognetwork.com, why can't I talk tonight?

995
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,580
Vognetwork.com Discord.

996
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,420
And we have chats throughout the week.

997
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,740
And there's some very interesting excerpts from the whole thing.

998
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,020
And one of them basically alludes to, and I'm going to make a long story very, very

999
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:23,460
short here, is basically alluding to the fact that, well, Stadia didn't have Call of Duty

1000
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,700
and Stadia failed.

1001
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,260
Therefore, Stadia failed because it didn't have Call of Duty.

1002
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,540
That is dumb.

1003
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,260
I know.

1004
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,900
I know.

1005
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,220
It is 100% with you all.

1006
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,700
Stadia failed for a multitude of reasons.

1007
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,220
And it's all with the business and none of the technical.

1008
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:50,980
And to me, I also look at some of my Stadia and I look at Destiny 2 or our beloved Dead

1009
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,700
by Daylight.

1010
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,420
Dark Soccer, you streamed, you've put a lot of hours into Dead by Daylight and you were

1011
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,380
like the biggest Stadia Dead by Daylight streamer out there, at least as far as I know of.

1012
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:05,540
How many other Twitch people did you run into that streamed Dead by Daylight on Stadia?

1013
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,500
Not on Twitch.

1014
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,060
I found, actually, I take that back.

1015
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:19,540
Well, I didn't know if they streamed or not, but I found another person in, I think they

1016
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:24,900
were the killer in our match or something like that, but they also played on Stadia

1017
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,460
on a Mac.

1018
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:30,100
And I was like, hello, fellow unicorn.

1019
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:37,940
And we chatted over it and it was pretty cool, but it's only ever happened the once.

1020
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:38,440
Right.

1021
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:45,540
And I mean, and now I'm on GeForce and people are still surprised that I'm, I mean, which

1022
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,540
is technically through my Steam account.

1023
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,040
Right.

1024
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:53,860
But it's still having to use a cloud-based service to be able to log into my game.

1025
00:55:54,580 --> 00:56:01,300
So, and I just want to note with all of this is that number one is that if there were,

1026
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,020
if that was the problem, what is turning up in this that, you know, because Stadia didn't

1027
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,860
have Call of Duty, that's why Stadia failed.

1028
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,740
Like, look at the other games that are multi-platform.

1029
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:16,820
Stadia was a blip, a drop in the ocean on those other platforms.

1030
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,780
Like, Call of Duty being on Stadia would not have made, because you know what?

1031
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,300
Call of Duty could have been on Stadia, but Phil Harrison still would have been the executive

1032
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,140
and it still would have been a Google-owned company.

1033
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,460
Therefore, it still would have failed for all the same reasons.

1034
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,380
Can somebody send that to the courts?

1035
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:35,540
It's also a completely different pricing structure.

1036
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,140
And so the reason Stadia failed, obviously, and they probably don't realize this either,

1037
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:46,020
is it's like, imagine if you had a Netflix, but then instead of getting to watch all those

1038
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:50,020
programs for free with your subscription, you just had to buy them all.

1039
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,980
Like, no one wants to do that.

1040
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,980
And so obviously, yeah, Game Pass, you know, does well.

1041
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,140
I mean, but Game Pass is just one part of it.

1042
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,500
Nothing saying that, you know, you couldn't put Game Pass on PlayStation.

1043
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,780
You have EA and Ubisoft have their streaming services and they're on all the consoles.

1044
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,620
Like, why couldn't you do the same?

1045
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Like, it's just silly.

1046
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:19,060
It's also silly because they don't look at like, what about like going back to Netflix

1047
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,500
and like Disney and stuff like that?

1048
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,100
What about all those exclusive deals that they have with TV shows and stuff like that?

1049
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,900
Does the UK regulators have problems with that?

1050
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,860
Because that's unfair to like the office.

1051
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,620
Is it on all the streaming services?

1052
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,660
That's just not fair.

1053
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,460
Like, I'm sorry, but like, that's not how it works.

1054
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,660
And and I think that the fact that they said, yeah, you know, we'll put it on those services

1055
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:41,780
for 10 years.

1056
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,460
I think that's more than fair.

1057
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:48,740
Like, by by the way, like, it shouldn't be in perpetuity because like, come up with your

1058
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,140
own shit.

1059
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,460
I mean, seriously, like, sorry.

1060
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,420
Going to a comment from chat.

1061
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:58,340
Matt says, whoever put that claim in cough, Sony cough, knew what they were doing.

1062
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:03,380
They knew that the CMA wasn't going to double check the context for that very broad subjective

1063
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,340
statement that that is the most infuriating thing.

1064
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,060
That is the most infuriating thing because I bet it was Sony that put it.

1065
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,900
I mean, can't prove it, but I bet it was.

1066
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,860
Sony put it in.

1067
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,340
You know what?

1068
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,620
Did you did everybody forget?

1069
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,740
Did the UK forget?

1070
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,340
Did every what happened?

1071
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,860
Sony bought a cloud gaming company years ago.

1072
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,820
Did you all forget?

1073
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:28,020
Gaikai, they bought Gaikai and created PlayStation Now out of it.

1074
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,500
Sony has cloud gaming.

1075
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:35,300
They're not using it to its full potential.

1076
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,540
How is that Microsoft's fault?

1077
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:39,860
I don't get it.

1078
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,820
Why is it Microsoft's fault that Nintendo continues to lag behind in these advancing

1079
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,220
actually?

1080
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:52,180
No, Nintendo does have cloud gaming stuff on the switch.

1081
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,820
It's just it's implemented funky, whatever.

1082
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,740
So how is this Microsoft's fault?

1083
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,420
It's the other companies are doing cloud gaming.

1084
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,980
It's their choice on how they're implementing it.

1085
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:07,860
And even even with companies implementing it, several of the voice, Dark Soccer, I don't

1086
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:12,500
mean to put you on the spot, but like Dead by Daylight, that's your bread and butter

1087
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,460
for streaming.

1088
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:22,020
So when Stadia closed, you had a choice and you sampled.

1089
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,220
I remember there was another one based out of Europe that you were thinking about going

1090
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:26,420
with, but that's it.

1091
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,540
But the lag kind of was too much of an issue.

1092
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,820
But hypothetically, Dead by Daylight is on xCloud.

1093
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:40,740
You could have gone to Microsoft's cloud based gaming to stream Dead by Daylight, but

1094
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,660
you went with GeForce Now.

1095
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,820
Is there is there a reason?

1096
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,060
Because nothing else had Dead by Daylight.

1097
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,100
I thought Xbox did.

1098
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:54,260
Well, yeah, I could have gotten it through the Windows Store, but I'm not on a Windows

1099
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:54,660
machine.

1100
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:56,820
Worked for me.

1101
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,860
So there's there's other had.

1102
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,180
Yeah, I had to use something that compatible.

1103
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:10,260
So my point being that Microsoft is not as like all in, you know, that has a chokehold

1104
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,620
on this space like this is being led to believe.

1105
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:18,740
And look, I'm not trying to be I don't want people to be like, oh, Rob's a Microsoft fan

1106
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,060
boy.

1107
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:22,420
Rob's just, you know, gassing up Microsoft and all this stuff.

1108
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:28,740
Look, that's not there's there's two reasons why I want this merger to go through number

1109
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,020
well or or reasons why I feel that we're on the same mind zone.

1110
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:32,980
That was for sure.

1111
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:36,500
There's two reasons why I guess I should say I think this merger should go through.

1112
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,260
Let me let me correct.

1113
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:47,780
Number one, Activision Blizzard has a toxic issue at the head of the company.

1114
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:51,460
I'm talking about the and I've said that you all know how I feel if this is your first

1115
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,620
OLR, then I'm sorry this coming up.

1116
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,500
Well, but I'm not sorry because this is an issue in the industry that has to be dealt

1117
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,060
with.

1118
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:04,820
The CEO, the board, the senior leadership at Activision Blizzard is an actively toxic

1119
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,900
element in our industry that is so toxic.

1120
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,260
It's spreading.

1121
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:15,300
It is actively hurting the industry as a whole, not just Activision Blizzard.

1122
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,540
It must be dealt with.

1123
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,340
And if a big fish eating another big fish, as much as I don't always like that, if that

1124
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:28,020
is the only way to eliminate the toxicity out of the industry, then so be it.

1125
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,180
And for that reason, this merger must go through.

1126
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:38,580
And second of all is that in this case, I'm just going to just add real quick that this

1127
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:42,340
case, it's definitely a matter of the greater good.

1128
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:42,580
Yes.

1129
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:48,260
And the second thing is why I believe the merger should still go through is that with

1130
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:52,660
Microsoft in the cloud, Microsoft, yes, cloud gaming is the future.

1131
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:56,340
Yes, I would say Microsoft has a jumpstart on this.

1132
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:02,580
That is not Microsoft's fault for that.

1133
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,180
I'm sorry.

1134
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,980
Sony has the ability to do this.

1135
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,660
They don't.

1136
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,340
Sony willingly signed with the Azure platform.

1137
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:18,980
Nintendo could do this and does do it to an extent, I guess, on the cartridges if they

1138
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:19,540
wanted to.

1139
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,900
We all know Nintendo lags behind in the tech space.

1140
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,740
That's not their bread and butter, whatever.

1141
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:29,540
This is not Microsoft's fault that the rest of the industry is lagging behind them.

1142
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:36,900
This is not because of competitive agreements, that's not what Microsoft's doing.

1143
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,700
So this argument doesn't make sense, but here we are.

1144
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,860
We're stuck because guess what?

1145
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,060
They can appeal it.

1146
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:49,300
It might get overturned on appeal, but history shows it probably won't be.

1147
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:57,700
So at this point, either the whole thing gets called off or the UK ends up getting excluded

1148
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,380
from this, which could be very interesting.

1149
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:07,380
Meaning that it would be similar to what happened in Belgium with loot boxes, where some of

1150
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,020
those games that EA does, they just don't release in Belgium.

1151
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,700
So Call of Duty may just not be on any cloud service in the UK.

1152
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:22,260
We'll be playing it over here on cloud, but you won't get it over there because of your

1153
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,220
regulatory bodies.

1154
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,900
That could be something that happens.

1155
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:32,420
I don't know if it will, because to be fair, we're dunking on the UK because the US stuff

1156
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,780
hasn't started yet.

1157
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:39,700
And for all I know, I actually would err on the side of the arguments that are going to

1158
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:45,060
come out of the US court are going to be just as ridiculous, if not more so, probably more

1159
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:45,780
so.

1160
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,660
This is the appetizer to the main course, y'all.

1161
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,900
Bobby Black Wolf also points out an important point.

1162
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,020
The streaming on Nintendo games is run by the third parties.

1163
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,580
Nintendo doesn't actually do the streaming themselves.

1164
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:12,580
And fixation gaze in chat hits the nail on the head here with, I think, what's the game

1165
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,100
Sony's playing here.

1166
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,860
Sony just wants to be the big fish.

1167
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,460
Yep.

1168
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,900
That's exactly where the fall through.

1169
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,100
And they were to get the opportunity to try to purchase Activision.

1170
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,060
They would do it.

1171
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,740
They would absolutely do it.

1172
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,500
And we'd be back in this.

1173
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,780
And then you'd watch it probably go in the opposite direction because that's how the

1174
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,500
world works.

1175
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:40,660
I swear, if Sony tries to do this, that now I'm really going to be in a conundrum because

1176
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,940
I do want that toxicity out of the industry and everything I said is true.

1177
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,140
But it's going to be one of those things are like, oh, I'm so mad at Sony.

1178
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,260
I'm so mad at Sony.

1179
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,980
It shouldn't be Sony for the same reason.

1180
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,660
If Microsoft can't have them, Sony shouldn't have them.

1181
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:58,580
It's just like we're a smaller player and, you know, we're a smaller player in the cloud

1182
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:59,380
services.

1183
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:02,420
And so this will level the playing field for us so that we can be competitive.

1184
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,500
They'll be like, okay, and they'll do it.

1185
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,340
And like, it's just going to happen.

1186
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:11,540
Yeah, that's just how it's going to work because regulators and I'm sorry, like people in

1187
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:12,820
government are just stupid.

1188
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,660
They're complete morons, especially when it comes to tech because they're old and already

1189
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,220
they just drop themselves in the grave.

1190
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:23,060
But like, you know, eventually we'll get people in there that actually understand how the

1191
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:24,100
internet and things work.

1192
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:29,220
But right now we got idiots that like listen to lobbyists and that's just how it works.

1193
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:36,900
If it was Sony's lawyers that caused this to happen with those statements, Sony ought

1194
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,460
to be obligated to invest in their cloud platform more.

1195
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:45,540
But that's not the way business works, unfortunately.

1196
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,740
But it's going to be up to the users to demand it.

1197
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:51,380
And it's up to the mainstream press.

1198
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,700
This will never happen, but I'm going to say it anyway.

1199
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,620
It's up to the mainstream press to call them out on it in interviews.

1200
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,580
Call them out on it.

1201
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,580
The Microsoft deal didn't go through because of cloud gaming.

1202
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:05,620
What are you doing to enhance your cloud gaming in the competitive space?

1203
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,940
What is Sony working on with cloud gaming?

1204
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:15,620
It just, it's, it's, I just wish these companies got asked more on the bigger, but that's,

1205
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:20,580
you know, if a press outlet asked that, they'd never get another interview again.

1206
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:21,860
And unfortunately that's how it works.

1207
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:23,620
It just stinks.

1208
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:24,980
It stinks.

1209
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,900
There's a story that they want to perpetuate.

1210
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,380
That's, and so then, then in turn, that's why I would also say that's why you can't

1211
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:34,980
only listen to mainstream voices.

1212
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:39,540
You have to listen to the people that are willing to say whatever, because we're, we're

1213
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,540
not, we got nothing to lose.

1214
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:45,140
Let me tell you, tell you what it is.

1215
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:47,380
When I say we, I don't just mean OLR.

1216
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:51,300
I mean other educated, independent gaming podcasters.

1217
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:53,140
We're educated?

1218
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:54,740
For the most part.

1219
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,300
All right.

1220
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:55,800
Okay.

1221
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:57,300
Let's move on.

1222
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,900
We've, we've got other stuff to cover tonight.

1223
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,660
We could spend a lot of time getting angry about that, but let's, how about happy news?

1224
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,620
I'm sorry.

1225
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,420
This made my gay heart flutter and explode in rainbows.

1226
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:11,860
And that was the samba de amigo party central first batch of songs that are coming to the

1227
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:12,500
game.

1228
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,540
I'm sorry.

1229
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,140
This is gay rights.

1230
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:15,540
Okay.

1231
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,060
Don't be sorry about that.

1232
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:17,940
I know.

1233
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,500
Yeah, you're right.

1234
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,780
I'm absolutely not sorry.

1235
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,580
Not sorry.

1236
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:21,300
Exactly.

1237
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:26,980
So samba de amigo has songs and they've, they've announced what's coming out.

1238
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:32,820
We've got Carly Rae Jepsen with I Really Like You, Ariana Grande, not just with Break

1239
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:39,620
Three, Break Free, but with Bang Bang, which was the Jessie J and Nicki Minaj collaboration.

1240
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,380
Tick Tock by Kesha.

1241
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,460
Miley Cyrus with Plastic Hearts.

1242
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,380
Who did I miss?

1243
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:47,860
Oh, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor.

1244
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:52,820
Only like one of the most iconic LGBT songs ever.

1245
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,380
And then, yeah.

1246
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,460
If ever there was a gay song, that is it.

1247
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,260
I'm sorry.

1248
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,300
Rina Sawayama is actually in this with XS?

1249
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:07,380
Like who, who is the gay intern that threw all these into the pot for songs to license

1250
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,620
because they should be promoted immediately.

1251
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,620
Cause this is an amazing song list.

1252
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:15,700
And we have a Ricky Martin with a Cup of Life and all that.

1253
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:18,660
Icona Pop.

1254
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,380
This is, this is incredible song list.

1255
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:21,940
Incredible.

1256
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:25,620
So is it, is it I Want It?

1257
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:26,980
Yeah, yeah, it is.

1258
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:27,700
I Want It.

1259
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:27,940
Yeah.

1260
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:32,180
And Def does point out, sadly, this game is definitely not streamer friendly.

1261
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:32,740
Yes.

1262
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:36,100
So if you stream it on Twitch, you're going to have to yank the archive.

1263
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,260
Unfortunately, it's because of all the licensed music.

1264
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:42,580
It's, it's not going to be a good stream or, or for that, for that stream, you'll have

1265
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:47,060
to put your game capture on the track that doesn't save or, you know, that, that stuff.

1266
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:50,260
So, cause yeah, this is heavy on licensed music.

1267
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:54,260
I guess maybe you could get away with playing also on the song list.

1268
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,860
There are covers.

1269
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:56,340
That's right.

1270
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:00,020
Cover bands of the Macarena and La Bamba.

1271
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:03,140
So those, you could probably get away with playing on stream.

1272
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:11,140
But you know, you know what I think would be really funny is, is people who are like

1273
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,540
streaming and putting their video up online.

1274
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:20,500
If they added in like their own, like, like music or elevator music that happens to be

1275
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,460
the same tempo.

1276
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,900
Yeah, that's, that's funny.

1277
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,740
I would totally do that by the way.

1278
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:28,740
Misha in chat points out they're missing one though.

1279
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,780
Diana Ross.

1280
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,580
Well, yes.

1281
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:35,380
Sadly, an absence of Diana Ross, but we do know there are more songs coming.

1282
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:40,740
Although some people expect this is probably the license list and we probably have like

1283
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,620
Sega songs coming, which is going to be fine, you know, or other.

1284
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,380
I need my Burning Rangers theme again.

1285
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,100
I'm just saying.

1286
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:52,420
So there, there's probably not a lot of licensed stuff left, but DLC question mark?

1287
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,620
Depends how well the game does, I suppose.

1288
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:01,380
So, but I know this, this went from being like a tiny little thing on my radar to like,

1289
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:04,660
oh, you're getting this when it comes out.

1290
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:08,420
So, uh, that's, that's how I feel about that song list for sure.

1291
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:09,620
All right.

1292
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:13,780
Well, speaking of going ons at Sega, another bit of excellent news, right Dark Sakura?

1293
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:16,500
Yes, indeed.

1294
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:21,540
So Sega of America staff has formed a union.

1295
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:22,600
Yay.

1296
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:27,060
Collaborative support.

1297
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,540
Anyway.

1298
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:35,700
They call it Aegis, Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega.

1299
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,540
And they have partnered with the Communications Workers of America.

1300
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:41,780
That is awesome.

1301
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,580
I mean, especially with it being Sega.

1302
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:48,340
I mean, my goodness that that's pretty amazing.

1303
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:56,900
Um, but at any rate, um, they are already a super majority of 144 employees across the

1304
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:01,940
various internal departments at Sega of America, of course, which is based out of Irvine.

1305
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:09,460
Um, the announcement also claims the third of Sega's longtime workers don't have full-time

1306
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,860
status, adequate training or bereavement leave.

1307
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:21,940
So they're going to be working to bargain for improvement within the company, especially

1308
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:26,980
for, uh, like here's some of the lists of, of, uh, requests.

1309
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:34,100
So higher base pay that follows industry standards, um, with accommodation for the

1310
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,660
raises being tied to the cost of living and inflation.

1311
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,220
Improved stable benefits for all, including healthcare, retirement, remote work options,

1312
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:42,180
and more.

1313
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,420
I think the bereavement leave would be included with that.

1314
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:51,380
Um, increased clearly outlined opportunities for advancement, balanced workloads and schedules,

1315
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:57,700
and defined responsibilities for all positions, adequate staffing of departments to end patterns

1316
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,820
of overwork.

1317
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:07,060
Um, and I mean, that's, I mean, what other companies did at ZeniMax, uh, Blizzard?

1318
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:08,500
Didn't someone else?

1319
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,340
Oh, there's been, it's, it's, this is not the first and it's not going to be the last.

1320
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,820
Biggest, I would say.

1321
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:22,260
Sega has, I think a track record of having been iffy on some of their internal policies

1322
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:27,380
and hiring practices, and hopefully this is going to stabilize it and make it a lot better

1323
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,060
for the employees.

1324
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:34,980
Um, yeah, I want to say the last time we had a union forming story, I want to say it was

1325
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:40,100
Blizzard's, um, Vicarious Visions, I think when they acquired, that was the Diablo, the

1326
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,980
Diablo 2 remake studio that Blizzard acquired.

1327
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:43,220
Yeah.

1328
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:48,900
And, and also I'm just going to say, I think that the name is great, you know, and Aegis

1329
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,620
is a type of shield, you know, so I think that the name fits.

1330
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:55,060
I'm glad they made the acronym work.

1331
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:56,180
Excellent.

1332
01:12:56,820 --> 01:12:57,060
All right.

1333
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,940
Well, like I said, not the first and won't be the last.

1334
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,180
So, all right, moving on.

1335
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,820
Loki, exciting changes with the long running store, right?

1336
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,100
Yeah, well, it is changes at least.

1337
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:16,500
So there's been some updates being done to the Steam interface.

1338
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:21,380
So mainly the whole, like in-game tab that you have that you could see your achievements

1339
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,780
and stuff, they're retooling that quite a bit.

1340
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:30,820
And along with it, they're also adding, like a notes app that where you can like take,

1341
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:34,900
you know, notes of basically whatever you're doing in game.

1342
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:38,820
It reminds me of like the phone notes app that you have, basically.

1343
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:44,900
I've literally done that, like in my Twitch chat, like No Man's Sky, I'll play No Man's

1344
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:48,180
Sky and I'll be like, I want to come back to this planet later.

1345
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,620
I need to remember the name.

1346
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:53,620
So I'll go over to my Twitch chat and type the name and put like, when I come back later,

1347
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:55,620
I'll scroll up and look at the name of that planet.

1348
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:57,780
So, or galaxy or something like that.

1349
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,740
So like, I get it, like a notes app would actually be super useful.

1350
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,900
Yeah, I wonder if it saves it per game.

1351
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,820
That would be kind of interesting to see if it does that.

1352
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:08,660
But yeah, so basically they have it within app that you can do that.

1353
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,780
They're just kind of changing the way that the overall toolbar looks as far as like they

1354
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:20,260
said they have a toolbar that allows you to access like different pop up windows and clean

1355
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:26,100
friends, chats, achievement progress, guides, discussions and your browser.

1356
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:27,700
That's pretty cool.

1357
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,820
Like you can open up all that stuff within a game.

1358
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:35,060
Right now it's available through the Steam beta client, but I'm not sure when it's coming

1359
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:36,820
to the actual full client though.

1360
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,380
Probably soon.

1361
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:38,820
All right.

1362
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:40,100
Well, not everybody's a fan.

1363
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:44,420
I noticed fixationgaze in our chat says, got to say the storefront looks super cluttered

1364
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:44,740
now.

1365
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:45,300
Not a fan.

1366
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,780
So I don't know if that's, sorry.

1367
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,980
I don't know if that's a comment about this particular beta or if that's just a general

1368
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:55,220
comment about the store, which to be fair has felt cluttered for a bit.

1369
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,220
Like there's just so much on it.

1370
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,900
This isn't necessarily the storefront.

1371
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,180
This is more of the in-game app.

1372
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:00,420
I see.

1373
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:00,580
Okay.

1374
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,780
I misinterpreted the comment.

1375
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:02,260
My bad.

1376
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,380
The storefront is very cluttered.

1377
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:05,860
Yes.

1378
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,100
Yeah.

1379
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,140
So all right.

1380
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:13,380
Well, moving on, let's talk about a big game that released this week.

1381
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,260
I don't think any of us have had a chance to check it out yet.

1382
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,780
I know I've seen people on Twitch playing it.

1383
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:22,900
That's about the furthest I've gotten, but Star Wars Jedi Survivor is out and there are

1384
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:28,180
some accessibility options in the game that are kind of, you know, new and unique, including

1385
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,620
a slow mode.

1386
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,900
So in just not the game's performance.

1387
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:33,620
No, it's not.

1388
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,540
I hear it's having a real hard time of hitting 60 FPS.

1389
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,980
Nothing to do with that.

1390
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:41,620
It's not even, this is also on consoles.

1391
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:47,060
So you can fully remap the controls, subtitle, visual options, all the things that ought

1392
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,060
to be base kit at this point, but okay.

1393
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,420
I mean, yay that they're doing that and different difficulty settings.

1394
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,540
So if you want to play on Bobby Black Wolf mode, or if you want to play on nightmare

1395
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,540
mode or whatever, you can do that.

1396
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:05,540
But slow mode will allow you to slow all of the action to help make the play easier.

1397
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,740
You can also just auto activate it on combat.

1398
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:12,340
And I have to say that's one of the things I was looking forward to a Final Fantasy 16

1399
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:16,100
as well when they were showing that off is that they have an item that you can equip

1400
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:21,060
that will only like when an attack is coming in, it just slows at that moment and gives

1401
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,820
you an extra time to hit the defense trigger than it normally would.

1402
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:29,780
And for me, that's great because like dodging and blocking is literally the worst thing

1403
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,980
I do in games.

1404
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:34,180
So having that slowed down for me, I think is going to be great.

1405
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:38,340
So I love that it's implemented in its own way here as well.

1406
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:39,380
I think that's great.

1407
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:43,780
So five difficulty settings in the game from story mode to Jedi Grandmaster is the name

1408
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:46,660
of the hardcore mode or whatever.

1409
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,900
But yeah, yay accessibility.

1410
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,740
It's nice to see the big studios.

1411
01:16:50,740 --> 01:16:55,460
And to be fair, for all the shit EA has gotten over the years and rightfully so, I do feel

1412
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:00,260
like accessibility and that whole thing, they do pretty good on that front.

1413
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,420
But yes, Loki, the other criticisms you're putting out there as far as here we go again

1414
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:08,900
with some of the bugs and things that should have been fixed before release.

1415
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,460
Yeah, that part, not so great.

1416
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:18,580
So as Joan Hunter Matt in chat says, kudos to the industry for taking accessibility seriously.

1417
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:22,740
And Bobby Blackwolf pointing out another game that does this very well, Forza Horizon 5

1418
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:23,940
also does this very well.

1419
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:30,020
Quest Buster says a lot of improved accessibility though in lots of games and services.

1420
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,860
It's gotten a lot better in the last 10 years.

1421
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:36,020
So it's been warming to see they even have their own award category.

1422
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:42,740
Quest Buster in chat says, survivor's performance issues regrettably smother all of the positives

1423
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,740
that it does well, such as the story.

1424
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:48,580
Some have said that it's one of the best Star Wars story told, period.

1425
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,260
All right, Bobby Blackwolf says, so nothing about the spiders or did I miss that?

1426
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,500
Oh, is that I did I miss that?

1427
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:58,980
Yep.

1428
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,660
They have a mode that turns out spiders.

1429
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,380
Oh, that's nice.

1430
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,500
That makes me think of so Grounded.

1431
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:10,500
You remember that game had that is that you could turn the spiders into just like, I guess

1432
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,460
they're like orbs.

1433
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:16,260
Like they don't they don't look like it's like baseball, baseball 2000 or whatever,

1434
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,460
which I laugh.

1435
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:21,140
But that's actually a great thing for people that, like, seriously have issues when it

1436
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:22,260
comes to spiders.

1437
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,620
That's cool that you can do that.

1438
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:30,100
And like, you know, like if you're seeing these gray baseball 2000, you're like, I opted

1439
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:30,980
into that.

1440
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:34,900
So I'm not going to hold the game responsible because these enemies look a little tacky.

1441
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,100
I opted into that.

1442
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:40,500
And I'm thankful that I'm not seeing a spider right now because so

1443
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:46,340
well, if only they would do something like that for snails and slugs, I would be happy

1444
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:51,940
because that's my massive disgusting phobia is to the point that if I see one of those

1445
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:56,900
weird mollusks in my house, it doesn't matter what time it is, I will wake up Dan and say

1446
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,100
go take care of this for me.

1447
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,900
Do those, well, I guess because I didn't even think spiders existed in Star Wars.

1448
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:04,820
But I was like, do those exist in Star Wars?

1449
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,500
But there are always invertebrates.

1450
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,000
Yeah.

1451
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:16,340
Bobby points out that the instead of what's happening with Grounded where you change what

1452
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:21,300
the spiders look like, Bobby says it removes the spiders completely so it makes the game

1453
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,180
easier.

1454
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:27,700
And of course, you know, there are those hardcore gamers out there that take themselves so

1455
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:34,740
seriously, they are offended because the game got easier for someone else.

1456
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:35,940
And it ruined my day.

1457
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,740
I got nothing.

1458
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,540
People are silly.

1459
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,660
I got nothing.

1460
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:45,700
I need a new story.

1461
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,220
Let's talk about the next story.

1462
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,020
Dark Sakura.

1463
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:50,260
Vampires.

1464
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,300
Kids like vampires, right?

1465
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:53,780
Heck yeah.

1466
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,220
Is this New Castlevania?

1467
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:56,900
No, damn it.

1468
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,260
It's Vampire Survivor.

1469
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,460
Okay, that game's pretty rad too.

1470
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:07,300
It's actually in works right now to be an animated television series coming out from

1471
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,100
Story Kitchen.

1472
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:17,140
And they are partnering with the game's developer, Ponkel, the founder of, sorry, the Ponkel

1473
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:24,260
founder, Luca Galante, I guess, to adapt it into a full-on animated TV series.

1474
01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:31,940
I wonder how it would work given what the weird gameplay of it is like.

1475
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:40,340
But the story is that it's set in 2021 rural Italy where there was, hold on, I'll just

1476
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,100
read the quote from the description.

1477
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:48,660
There lived an evil person named Bisconti Dracula, whose many evil magics created a

1478
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:51,620
bad world filled with famine and suffering.

1479
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:57,540
It's now up to the members of the Belpasse family to end his reign of terror and return

1480
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,500
good food to the table.

1481
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:04,420
But you know what's, okay, the thing about Vampires Virus, I love that game, but it's

1482
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:10,660
very clearly heavily influenced by Castlevania, like right on down to how some of the sprites

1483
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,380
look and things.

1484
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:16,740
So it's only a little surprising to me because Castlevania, also an animated TV show.

1485
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:21,780
But the Dracula myth is public domain.

1486
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,500
True, true.

1487
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:26,820
The iconography of Dracula is public domain.

1488
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:28,660
I guess that's true.

1489
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:32,020
So yeah.

1490
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,900
It is just interesting.

1491
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:37,620
And on top of that, it looks like it's going to be a completely different story.

1492
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:45,620
I think the Castlevania one is set more in the Eastern European area, and this looks

1493
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,700
like it's in Italy in the modern day.

1494
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:53,220
So there's quite a bit of difference on this one.

1495
01:21:53,860 --> 01:22:01,220
And honestly enough, if Konami knows what's smart for them, they would partner with the

1496
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:04,100
game's creator to do a Castlevania chapter.

1497
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,140
Well, and this is another indie darling.

1498
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,420
It's a completely different kind of game.

1499
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:12,660
I know, yeah, the gameplay is obviously completely different, but it's just interesting.

1500
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,620
Like, it feels heavily inspired.

1501
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:15,940
That's all.

1502
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:17,220
But you're right.

1503
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:22,740
Dracula itself is in the, you know, but what was I going to say with this?

1504
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:26,580
Oh, this seems like it's really now official.

1505
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:30,660
You kind of knew it from watching Twitch, but this is the official latest indie darling

1506
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,540
to just catch fire and end up in mainstream media.

1507
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:37,460
This joins a line of games I would argue started with Minecraft, quite frankly.

1508
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:40,980
I mean, I know Minecraft is not indie anymore, but certainly that.

1509
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:47,620
But then even after that, you had things like Five Nights at Freddy's, Undertale, you

1510
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:52,500
know, these indie games that are now on target shelves with licensing.

1511
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:59,220
Well, and it's also, you know, they were the rush of indie horror games.

1512
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:09,140
You know, like I watched Holly playing one that looked like it was like an old floppy

1513
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:12,740
disk game and it had glitching and everything, but the glitching was part of the game.

1514
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:13,140
I don't remember.

1515
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:14,820
Yes, I thought I would too.

1516
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:18,100
I think timely enough, there's a new Amnesia game like this week, too.

1517
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:20,420
Let's speak of indie horror stuff.

1518
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:20,920
Yeah.

1519
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:26,980
But the thing about it is that this game is more like, you know, Smash TV on crack.

1520
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:27,480
Yeah.

1521
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:37,860
I mean, Smash TV on a crack bender is what it is, you know, and I wonder how they're

1522
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:47,620
going to incorporate that flooding of enemies aspect into the game or into the show in a

1523
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:51,460
believable manner, or I would say in a visually tolerable manner.

1524
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:56,980
On a completely different note, talking about like indie darlings that are catching fire

1525
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,340
and showing up on target shelves eventually into mainstream media.

1526
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:05,140
Do you know what game seems to be headed for that right now based on Twitch, like the latest

1527
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,340
indie game that's shown up?

1528
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,380
And I don't know if it's just a bias because I see a lot of Dead by Daylight streamers,

1529
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:10,660
which is what I usually follow.

1530
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:13,140
I don't know if it's because this is the game I see a lot of them playing or if it's really

1531
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,140
it's that Deceive Inc.

1532
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,500
Have you seen that one?

1533
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:18,180
Yeah.

1534
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:22,580
I feel like tons of people are playing Deceive Inc. all of a sudden, which admittedly I haven't

1535
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:27,700
actually sat down and watched a lot of it, but it feels like it mixes kind of like some

1536
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:34,420
of the first person stuff with like Among Us type of thing and that whole with like characters

1537
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:35,700
like Clue or something.

1538
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:41,300
It seems very interesting, but it seems like that might be the latest indie up and comer

1539
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,940
on Steam or on Twitch and all that.

1540
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:51,300
So now our chat is going down a different tangent train because the talk of animated

1541
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:55,220
shows brought us to something that I don't think we've brought up on the show.

1542
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:59,380
And that is, this is about a month old at this point, but the news that they are making

1543
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:04,500
a Scott Pilgrim TV show out of, I believe it's adapted from the original anime series,

1544
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:04,660
right?

1545
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:08,260
The anime, but the, the huge news with it, the comic.

1546
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:08,500
Yeah.

1547
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:08,740
Yeah.

1548
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:15,380
The huge news with it is that they got the entire original movie cast to reprise their

1549
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:22,580
roles, which when you consider a lot of them were like pre A-listers like Brie Larson,

1550
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:26,100
you know, that like you've got a lot of people that are really big.

1551
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,500
Or what's her name that played Kim that was in Picard as the new board queen?

1552
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,380
Oh, that was her.

1553
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,060
Oh, that's, oh, that's wild.

1554
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:37,220
Yeah.

1555
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:40,100
But there's like all these people that are, you know, huge.

1556
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:43,060
They're all, and one of the Chris's is in it.

1557
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,700
Oh yeah.

1558
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,220
And Chris Evans was in it.

1559
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:47,780
Chris Evans.

1560
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:52,340
They're all re, all coming back and doing their voices, which is great.

1561
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:55,700
And what's his name that played Todd Ingram was also a big name.

1562
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,180
Hold on.

1563
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:58,980
Actor.

1564
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,180
I know who he is.

1565
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:00,580
Hold on.

1566
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,060
Brandon Routh, right?

1567
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:04,180
Yeah.

1568
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:04,680
Yeah.

1569
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,180
Cause he was Superman.

1570
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:07,380
Yeah.

1571
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:11,460
His, his, unfortunately I would say his star was probably larger when that movie came out

1572
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,180
than it is now.

1573
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,140
No, no shade on him.

1574
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:16,820
It's just, you know, Superman was, was not that long before Scott Pilgrim.

1575
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:21,140
So, um, but yeah, but it's, it's pretty, pretty wild that they got everybody Anna

1576
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:25,940
Kendrick's in there too as Scott's sister and she, you know, then Pitch Perfect happened.

1577
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:26,180
Right.

1578
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:27,220
So, you know, it's good.

1579
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,820
It got a lot of big names in there.

1580
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:34,180
So, of course there's, there's absolutely my, my favorite character.

1581
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:38,900
Um, uh, well, no, that was, yeah, that was, um,

1582
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:41,780
that's right.

1583
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,140
Julie powers.

1584
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,700
I was going to say Aubrey Plaza was in that game or in that movie.

1585
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,220
I forgot, God, it was all these good people that were in there.

1586
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:55,540
So yeah, uh, Shane and chat wondering, I wonder who the other characters that they

1587
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:57,380
cut from the movie will be played by.

1588
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:03,700
I feel like nobody, nobody a-list because they've blown all the budget on that.

1589
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:09,700
Um, no, it'll be fucking, um, why can't I, why can't I do names today?

1590
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,820
Mario, Star Lord.

1591
01:27:15,140 --> 01:27:15,540
That's it.

1592
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:17,300
Chris, why can't I do names today?

1593
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,180
Let's not.

1594
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:21,860
I know, I know, but I'm just, I'm being very tongue in cheek when I say that.

1595
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:22,920
All right.

1596
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,220
Moving on.

1597
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,380
Let's go to our next story.

1598
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:27,880
Loki.

1599
01:27:28,740 --> 01:27:32,500
It'll just have Macaulay Culkin do it since his brother's in there.

1600
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:33,380
I'd be okay with that.

1601
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:35,940
He's, he's too for a renaissance.

1602
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:37,380
Wait, have him, have him play who?

1603
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:38,500
I don't know.

1604
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:38,820
Anybody.

1605
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:39,620
One of the cut characters.

1606
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:41,940
I don't care.

1607
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,300
You can play a convenience store.

1608
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:48,660
He can play the guy that, um, uh, Steven Stills hooks up with.

1609
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:51,060
The recording studio guy.

1610
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:55,700
Um, to respond to this comment in chat as 200 Matt says, Rob needs coffee.

1611
01:27:56,420 --> 01:27:56,980
Yes.

1612
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:01,540
I didn't have a coffee for the show tonight and I probably should have, I was actually

1613
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:02,500
just personal story.

1614
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:05,780
So I have the problem that dark soccer I had last week.

1615
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:09,540
And that is that I went to San Francisco yesterday.

1616
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:14,260
I actually went so far as to stay the night because I went to Rocky horror picture show

1617
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:19,540
to see the lovely Aria snark take on the role of Frank and further in Rocky horror.

1618
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,620
I didn't even make it through the whole movie.

1619
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,620
I didn't even, I didn't even, I didn't even make it through the whole movie.

1620
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:27,780
I went and I say, I stayed in a hotel last night.

1621
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,300
I didn't get to bed till like 2 AM.

1622
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:33,060
Uh, and then yeah, I got up early and came home.

1623
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:35,860
So yes, I'm, I'm running on fee and there may have been drinking involved.

1624
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:40,100
So as there sometimes is at the Rocky horror picture show and why I stayed in a hotel.

1625
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:45,060
I'm live one salty survivor tears, AKA Kona coffee.

1626
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:45,300
Yeah.

1627
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,540
Get that product placement in.

1628
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:47,860
All right.

1629
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,340
All right.

1630
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:51,140
Moving on Loki.

1631
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:51,640
I'm sorry.

1632
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:58,900
Uh, so yeah, we have a, well, hopefully not life ruining a lawsuit like with Nintendo,

1633
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:05,460
but you may remember a while back bungee was suing folks that were creating cheats for

1634
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,420
destiny too.

1635
01:29:07,060 --> 01:29:14,820
And, uh, the cheat software, I guess being sold by veteran cheats was basically a target

1636
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,300
of that.

1637
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:20,820
And so now they have finished that court case and have won $12 million from the suit.

1638
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:28,660
And of course, uh, with that, they said that bungee is taking 12 meal, $12,059,912 and

1639
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:37,380
98 cents and total damages with, they said, uh, 11,696,000 going towards violations of

1640
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:44,100
the DMCA and the other 146,000 plus for violations of the copyright act.

1641
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:48,340
And then 217,000 accounting for the studio's attorney expenses.

1642
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:53,940
And he said, uh, after subpoenaing the Stripe, uh, which is a payment service, obviously

1643
01:29:54,820 --> 01:30:01,380
bungee learned that at least 50 or 5,848 separate transactions took place through the service.

1644
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:01,880
Wow.

1645
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,420
So this is way more than I actually expected.

1646
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,340
That's that's, that's a lot of cheating.

1647
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:16,820
Um, I'm not sure who, if it's just like one seller, it's against the seller, um, Mihai

1648
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,460
Fadou Florentine.

1649
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:23,940
So it may be an individual, but hopefully it's not like the Nintendo thing where they

1650
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:28,660
basically bankrupt that guy for life type of thing over like video game cheating.

1651
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:31,780
Um, we'll see, I guess.

1652
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,000
Yeah.

1653
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:34,580
I mean, yeah.

1654
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:35,860
I mean, I don't, I don't know.

1655
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:39,940
Is he, was the person in America or are they in another country?

1656
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:40,440
I missed that.

1657
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,900
I think they're in another, they're Romanian.

1658
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,100
So then I can't answer that.

1659
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:47,780
If it was America, they could do that same, the garnishment of the salary and all that

1660
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,380
stuff to, to do the judgment.

1661
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,420
They could do all that.

1662
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:55,700
So, um, but I don't know how that money, no, but I'm just to answer the question, can they

1663
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,900
bankrupt the individual?

1664
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:59,620
I don't know how it works because he's Romanian and non-American.

1665
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,780
So, yeah.

1666
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:03,460
I know that the galleys are going to be funky.

1667
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,940
Uh, by the way, I will take Shayla's offer in our chat over twitchy slash vog network

1668
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,780
saying I can teleport and deliver coffee.

1669
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,260
Done taken, come on over.

1670
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,620
Me casa su casa, especially if you have coffee.

1671
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,740
Shayla's got some magical powers.

1672
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:24,020
I think that one would just be another one on the list other than being, you know, chaos

1673
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:26,580
personified and the killer tamer.

1674
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:28,520
All right.

1675
01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:32,740
Well, moving on, let's talk about a classic game.

1676
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:38,100
Game that I don't think a lot of people were pirating or, um, you know, asking for to come

1677
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,380
back, but I don't know.

1678
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:41,220
These games have their fans, that's for sure.

1679
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:45,140
And that is the Jurassic park retro collection.

1680
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:48,820
Now here's before you get too excited, let me explain this.

1681
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:56,420
So limited run games, uh, is doing a collection of classic Jurassic park titles.

1682
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:59,060
It's the 30th anniversary retro collection.

1683
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:03,700
Only the titles developed by ocean are in this collection.

1684
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:07,540
So the super Nintendo version, which here's the thing.

1685
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:11,940
There wasn't the thing about the super Nintendo Jurassic park.

1686
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:17,460
It came from an era when like 3d games were just being born.

1687
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:22,420
It was that Wolfenstein original doom era of PC games.

1688
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:27,540
And they figured out how to do that on the super Nintendo, which let's be real, wasn't

1689
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,120
easy.

1690
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:34,500
It was some serious sprite manipulation and that whole thing to make like a fake 3d type

1691
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,140
of thing work.

1692
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:39,860
So when they implemented that in Jurassic park, even though, and the trick was you were

1693
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,620
looking through goggles.

1694
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:46,260
So that way this on the screen, it was just like, like a quarter of the size of the screen

1695
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,140
in a goggle shape.

1696
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:52,100
And if you weren't born during the Wolfenstein era, that's how we got, how we got better

1697
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:52,660
performances.

1698
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:56,260
You'd shrink the screen down to like, you know, a post it.

1699
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:56,820
Yep.

1700
01:32:56,820 --> 01:32:57,320
Yep.

1701
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:01,380
So, and yeah, the, the chat is exploding going, God damn it.

1702
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:02,500
30 years.

1703
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:02,980
Yeah.

1704
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:04,420
That, that first movie.

1705
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,300
Was it 93 that it came out?

1706
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:08,260
I thought it was 94.

1707
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:11,300
I thought it was like my sophomore year of high school, but yeah, that first movie is

1708
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:12,340
old.

1709
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:17,220
I thought it came out when I graduated, but I had read the book before that.

1710
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:19,220
So I might be getting that confused.

1711
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:19,860
Yeah.

1712
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:20,980
I thought it was out longer.

1713
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:25,940
The only thing I remember really of the book was that, um, Malcolm always wore black and

1714
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:26,260
gray.

1715
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,540
So all of his clothes would match.

1716
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:35,620
Also in this was, uh, the NES games, which were in the Game Boy games, which were, you

1717
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:39,540
know, yeah, there was, there was a, it was 93.

1718
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:40,020
Wow.

1719
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:40,520
Okay.

1720
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:41,460
All right.

1721
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:45,140
Well, hence you remember there being an NES for hence 30 years.

1722
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:45,380
Yeah.

1723
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:48,580
Uh, it might, it might've only been in Europe.

1724
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:52,740
Cause Ocean was, uh, based in Europe.

1725
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,780
If I remember right.

1726
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,860
I, I would have to research that a little bit.

1727
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:58,180
I don't remember playing the NES one, but I do.

1728
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:02,260
I definitely remember playing the SNES one, but the, my point is because it's only the

1729
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:03,940
Ocean games, guess what's missing?

1730
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:10,900
Sega's ports, which were done by a different, which many people would say the, the Sega

1731
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:16,340
CD Jurassic Park was like the best one, but the one where you played as the dinosaur,

1732
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:18,020
that was the fun one.

1733
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,700
And the Genesis one.

1734
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:20,020
Yeah.

1735
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:20,900
It's the Genesis one.

1736
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:21,400
Yeah.

1737
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:25,220
I would be down for a revival of being a dinosaur.

1738
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:25,780
Yeah.

1739
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:30,580
And that was actually, you know, for that era was a really was like the, the unique

1740
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:36,740
twist that that was that now you play the villain quote unquote, that was actually a

1741
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:37,540
pretty rad twist.

1742
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:42,900
And I think why that game was, even if the super Nintendo one might've actually actually

1743
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,580
been technically better.

1744
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:49,380
The Genesis one was more fun because you get to do either way.

1745
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:52,420
The dinosaurs couldn't be called a villain, just an antagonist.

1746
01:34:52,420 --> 01:34:54,740
Cause they were just trying to, you know, get a meal.

1747
01:34:55,380 --> 01:34:57,060
You know, get out of the cage.

1748
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,060
Just, just do dinosaur things.

1749
01:34:59,060 --> 01:34:59,380
Okay.

1750
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:03,780
And I'm, my, my memory is warping because Matt is correct in me saying it was only the

1751
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:04,340
Genesis one.

1752
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:09,460
The Sega CD one was a point and click adventure game, which I, yeah, I remember.

1753
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:10,580
I thought I have it.

1754
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,260
I thought the CD version was just an amped up one of the Genesis.

1755
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:18,020
I thought that was a thing at some point, but I, was there a 32 X version?

1756
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:22,420
I don't think there was a 30 X one.

1757
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,040
Okay.

1758
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:29,940
Um, why am I thinking, I'm thinking of like a souped up Sega Genesis version for some

1759
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:32,260
reason, but maybe my brain just made it up.

1760
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,340
Actually, yes, there was a 32 X one, I believe.

1761
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,660
Um, hold on, I'm going to double check.

1762
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:45,460
Um, because it's saying that there was one for all three, but I don't recall the 32 X

1763
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:45,960
version.

1764
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:53,700
I just remember, um, that the, the Sega, I mean, maybe it was like an enhanced on 32

1765
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:53,940
X.

1766
01:35:53,940 --> 01:36:02,100
Yeah, but, but, um, but no, it was as far as I was aware, the highest level it came

1767
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:05,700
out of that era of games was going to be on the Sega CD.

1768
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,780
And I do have that one and it's terrible.

1769
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,180
All right.

1770
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:12,500
Well, then my bad for the way I phrased that earlier, I must've been thinking of 32 X or

1771
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,860
something, but it doesn't matter.

1772
01:36:13,860 --> 01:36:14,340
Do you know what?

1773
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:16,020
None of those games are in the collection.

1774
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:22,020
So it's, uh, it's, uh, only the Nintendo based ones, because again, for whatever reason,

1775
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,700
they were licensed to different companies.

1776
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:30,660
Ocean had the Nintendo rights and was it Sega themselves with the other, or did a third

1777
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:31,460
party do that for them?

1778
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:33,060
I do it for classic game.

1779
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:33,460
All right.

1780
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,380
I'll wait with bated breath.

1781
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:39,780
Meanwhile, since you, since you brought up classic game, dark Sakura.

1782
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,540
Well, you remember, I sent you, um,

1783
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:54,580
I'm playing the button and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive

1784
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:58,420
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1785
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:01,060
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1786
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,100
And what did you pick for us tonight?

1787
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,660
Dark Sakura Catherine.

1788
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:16,100
And also I actually sent you of, of AI Jamie introducing the classic game of the week.

1789
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,180
Do you think I've had time before the show to get that?

1790
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:23,140
Probably not, but I thought it's so weird sounding.

1791
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:27,460
It's, it's the same tone I hear in my head, you know, that I don't hear out loud, but,

1792
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,060
but anyway, back to the game.

1793
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:34,420
So I picked Catherine, which, um, it came out for, uh, the PlayStation three and Xbox

1794
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:40,980
three 60 in Japan and North America in 2011, the PAL versions came out in 2012.

1795
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:47,220
The windows version by Sega came out in 2019, but the game was developed by Atlas.

1796
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:56,420
Um, also just as a side, I, um, I read the book, there's a book of it and I have a translation

1797
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:56,920
of it.

1798
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:01,140
So, um, it's, it's quite, uh, quite interesting.

1799
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:04,180
The path that the book takes, it's, it's very different perspectives.

1800
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:13,460
Um, but, uh, the game follows a man named Vincent Brooks, who has weird supernatural

1801
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:21,380
nightmares and he is having a romantic crisis with his girlfriend, Catherine with a K and

1802
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:25,060
another, uh, girl named Catherine with a C.

1803
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:32,820
Um, and so it's divided between daytime where you have like a social SIM and then his dreams

1804
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:36,420
where you go through these 3d puzzle towers.

1805
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:41,780
So it's a combination of platforming and puzzle solving, and the game is affected by the choices

1806
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:43,460
Vincent makes over the story.

1807
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:52,420
Um, and actually it has a little bit, uh, in common with, uh, it's actually the same

1808
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:59,300
studio behind the persona series, including, uh, the director and producer, um, Hashino

1809
01:38:59,300 --> 01:38:59,860
Katsura.

1810
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:05,540
Um, the character designer is the same and the music composer is the same.

1811
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:12,420
That's, uh, Meguro Shoji and, uh, for the character designer, uh, Soijima Shigenori.

1812
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:19,300
Um, but the game started at the end of Persona 4's development in 2008, and they wanted

1813
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,540
to do something for a more adult audience.

1814
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:29,380
Um, uh, English localization was handled by Atlas USA and then, um, the, uh, update for

1815
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:35,460
full body was, uh, developed by Studio Zero, which is a newly formed division within Atlas

1816
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,580
that was led by Hashino.

1817
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:43,700
Um, but they wanted to expand on the original to bring back the cast and adding a new love

1818
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:48,340
interest named Rin, short for Catherine with a Q.

1819
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:53,060
Um, so going back though to the game is cross genre.

1820
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:57,860
So you are Vincent, you have your daytime social sim, where you have to interact with

1821
01:39:57,860 --> 01:40:00,340
different characters and make different decisions as you go.

1822
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:08,260
Um, and then you do your puzzle solving in the, uh, the puzzle, the, in the platform

1823
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:09,220
puzzle mode.

1824
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,900
So you have, um, three modes for that.

1825
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,980
There's in the single player story, uh, it's dubbed golden playhouse.

1826
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:22,420
And there's a multiplayer exclusive Coliseum challenge that is unlocked after completing

1827
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:22,920
the story.

1828
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:30,180
So in the daytime, Vincent interacts with the ladies and, uh, different characters at

1829
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:34,820
the stray sheep bar, and then he can choose different options to respond.

1830
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:39,380
Um, and these are in standard dialogue as well as in text messages.

1831
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:44,980
So, um, he can also purchase drinks that help his navigation of the nightmare.

1832
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:47,620
Um, but they also can impede his movement.

1833
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:53,620
If he has too many, there's a mini game called Rapunzel, which mimics the game play in nightmares.

1834
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:58,420
Um, or listen to a jukebox with different tracks from other Atlas games.

1835
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:03,220
When you leave the stray sheep, it triggers, uh, the next nightmare section.

1836
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:09,460
Um, and so you have to climb these blocks, which have to be arranged into a stairway

1837
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:10,660
to reach the exit.

1838
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:17,060
As you climb, the tower collapses underneath him, and he needs to arrange the blocks before

1839
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:20,180
the collapse comes or he will fall and the game ends.

1840
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:26,020
Uh, you'll restart from your last checkpoint on the tower if you have a pillow, um, or

1841
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:28,180
you have to restart the game from the last scene.

1842
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:35,620
Also funny enough, um, Vincent has, uh, ram horns in that mode.

1843
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:37,780
Um, it's, it's actually very cool.

1844
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:43,860
There's a lot of references to sheep and, and, you know, the sheep-like animals.

1845
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:52,100
Um, because I don't really, I know that there was like some sort of, uh, symbolism behind

1846
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:52,600
it.

1847
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:57,940
Um, but at any rate, um, you, after you complete a stage, you have a score, depending on the

1848
01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:03,620
time completed and the items that you collected and they're posted on online links, um, and

1849
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:08,100
posted on online leaderboards access, access through the game start menu.

1850
01:42:08,740 --> 01:42:14,100
Um, you can also get like different types of, uh, items in there, which you can purchase

1851
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:18,980
them between games or find them in the levels like spare blocks, uh, lightning blocks that

1852
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:23,140
remove enemies, energy drinks that let you to climb more steps at a time.

1853
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:28,580
Now in the full body release, there was a new mode that had rearranged versions of the

1854
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:35,700
puzzles, um, with the games arrangement being a sec, a separate mode.

1855
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:40,980
There's a new online multiplayer added where you can enter, uh, both randomized matches

1856
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:43,300
or a contest with a player of equal rank.

1857
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:48,500
Um, then there's Rin who can be called to halt the towers collapse for a short time.

1858
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:55,300
Uh, you can also access a new difficulty level called, uh, safety, which removes all the

1859
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:56,660
threats and time limits.

1860
01:42:56,660 --> 01:43:00,020
And it just lets you skip the puzzles and play the story.

1861
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:07,140
Um, the major characters in this game are of course, Vincent Brooks, a 32 year old systems

1862
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:09,620
engineer, who's the protagonist.

1863
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:11,940
He's just that tippler bachelor.

1864
01:43:12,740 --> 01:43:14,740
He was voiced by Troy Baker in English.

1865
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:22,100
Then there's Catherine with C the 22 year old woman who meets Vincent at the stray sheep

1866
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:23,780
and ends up spending the night with him.

1867
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:29,540
And, uh, she continues to try to romance Vincent and she's weird.

1868
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:38,500
She seems outwardly playful, seductive, but in reality, spoiler alert, she's a succubus.

1869
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:46,260
Then you have Catherine with a K a 32 year old, uh, office manager, uh, working for a

1870
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:47,860
clothes manufacturer.

1871
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:49,460
She went to high school with Vincent.

1872
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:53,540
They reconnected and were dating and she wants to marry him.

1873
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:56,580
But he's, she's irritated by how indecisive he is.

1874
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:03,780
Um, and then, and of course full body, there's being short for Catherine, who is an amnesiac

1875
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:09,380
who plays piano at the stray sheep and she becomes a comfort to Vincent.

1876
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:15,620
Um, and then of course you have his regular drinking buddies, Orlando, who I think Orlando

1877
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:16,740
is absolutely hilarious.

1878
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:20,740
Um, he's an old friend and divorcee.

1879
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:22,260
He's very cynical.

1880
01:44:22,260 --> 01:44:30,100
Uh, Johnny, um, Arika, who is an, uh, idealist looking for a soulmate and Toby Nebbins, who

1881
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,100
is, uh, Johnny's coworker.

1882
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:36,820
And he has a thing for Erica Anderson, who is a waitress at the stray sheep.

1883
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:38,340
There's Thomas mutton.

1884
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:39,460
Who's nicknamed boss.

1885
01:44:39,460 --> 01:44:40,660
He's the owner.

1886
01:44:40,660 --> 01:44:46,660
And it's narrated by Trisha, who is the host of the golden playhouse dubbed the midnight

1887
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:47,620
Venus.

1888
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:50,340
And so I'm not going to go too much more into it.

1889
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:55,940
It's, you know, is a pretty, pretty story intensive game.

1890
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:02,100
Um, although, uh, Trisha states in the game that the tower is a metaphor for the journey

1891
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:06,020
to adulthood and that there's no right way to climb the tower.

1892
01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:11,300
She talks directly to you and she eventually realizes that she is the goddess Ishtar.

1893
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:16,260
So, um, but yeah, there's, there's more through it.

1894
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:18,820
I'm not going to go too much deeper.

1895
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:24,500
They actually had almost considered making this a game for handheld or mobile devices,

1896
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:28,740
but, um, they ended up going with how they did.

1897
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:35,860
Um, it was not planned for local for a us release or Western release right away.

1898
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:40,660
But after a leak, uh, through EB games and GameStop Atlas USA confirmed that they were

1899
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:41,300
releasing it.

1900
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:45,220
Um, and it was localized, uh, by Atlas USA.

1901
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:48,340
Like I just said, who handled a lot of the companies earlier titles.

1902
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:54,020
Um, and the game took off.

1903
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:56,020
I mean, it really took off.

1904
01:45:56,820 --> 01:46:04,260
Um, and there were a bunch of the quotes that were used in the loading screens that were

1905
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:08,340
all famous quotes from a Japanese book of quotes.

1906
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:16,500
Um, and so, uh, they ended up having to use new quotes, um, instead of identifying and

1907
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,620
translating the existing ones, cause they didn't quote the original people.

1908
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:23,300
So they quoted Douglas Adams, George Carlin, Rodney Dangerfield.

1909
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:33,380
Um, and then, um, they were trying to do mainstream, uh, uh, promotion like target Walmart, but

1910
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:39,620
they were really behind, not behind it because of it being a quote adult title, but, um,

1911
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:45,620
they did a film reel of, uh, you know, AAA games that had more explicit content.

1912
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:47,940
And so like, these are worse than us.

1913
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:49,940
Let us be in your, in your little club.

1914
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:50,500
So it happened.

1915
01:46:51,220 --> 01:47:00,660
Um, as for, um, you know, going back to the, the full body is it was released after persona

1916
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:02,980
five, it was made with some of the persona staff.

1917
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:06,580
And it was considered the definitive version of Catherine.

1918
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:14,020
Um, which I know it's, it's closer than the 10 year limit, but it's going back into, it

1919
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:16,580
had downloadable content, all kinds of stuff.

1920
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:18,580
And you could play as Joker from persona five.

1921
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:22,500
Um, but they're there.

1922
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,420
They really wanted to focus on diversity, uh, diversity within the narrative and the

1923
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:27,300
gameplay.

1924
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:32,180
They want it to be something different, something that people haven't seen anything much like

1925
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:32,660
anymore.

1926
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:35,700
Um, yeah, the music was great.

1927
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,420
Uh, it received very positive reviews.

1928
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:47,540
Um, according to Metacritic, um, the game was considered, uh, Difficult due to the random

1929
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:55,300
enemy AI by some sites, but for the most part, the ratings were in the 80% plus range.

1930
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:59,380
Um, but yeah, it sold pretty well.

1931
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:07,620
Um, it can actually, even the Xbox version sold, like it came in at seventh place at

1932
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:11,780
the only, uh, the game it outsold actually was Marvel versus Capcom three.

1933
01:48:12,740 --> 01:48:14,980
So that's pretty interesting.

1934
01:48:14,980 --> 01:48:18,660
Um, but yeah, there's a PC port of the original game.

1935
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:22,420
It was considered one of the best selling new releases on steam in 2017.

1936
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:29,300
Um, and the, the full body version reached second place in the sales charts.

1937
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,540
Um, after it was released, there's a Vita version.

1938
01:48:32,260 --> 01:48:40,500
Um, it it's definitely, and it even won, um, uh, it was, uh, uh, nominated for an Annie

1939
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,940
award, which, uh, for best animated video game.

1940
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:49,700
And it was, uh, uh, also nominated for some of the navigator awards and actually won,

1941
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:55,780
uh, two when Michelle rough as Catherine with K, uh, for best support, uh, best supporting

1942
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:59,460
performer and writing in a drama was the other category.

1943
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,820
And so that's it, Catherine.

1944
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:06,420
Also, if anyone wants to read the translated book, let me know.

1945
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:09,860
It is a very interesting read, but a very straightforward translation.

1946
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:11,940
All right.

1947
01:49:11,940 --> 01:49:12,420
Interesting.

1948
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:15,220
Uh, the choice, I don't, I don't know this game very well.

1949
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:19,540
Obviously you explain it very well there in that segment, but, um, I, and I knew of the

1950
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:22,820
game when it first came out, but, um, I never really played it at all.

1951
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:24,340
So it just never was on my radar.

1952
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:31,380
So I would say watch like some partial playthroughs, like watch the, the tower scenes

1953
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:33,460
and maybe a scene here and there.

1954
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:33,620
Yeah.

1955
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:36,020
I was watching the, watching the B roll as you were talking about it.

1956
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:39,140
I liked some of the things where it was like using that whole, like, we're going to pull

1957
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:40,740
the internet on these same questions.

1958
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,780
We're asking you now.

1959
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:46,020
And the, the, you see that in telltale games, sometimes that whole thing is interesting.

1960
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:46,260
Yeah.

1961
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:48,900
So I think it's an absolutely fascinating game.

1962
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:52,500
I had trouble with the tower scenes just because of my wrists at the time.

1963
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:58,820
Um, but it's, it's absolutely worth revisiting and, and, you know, you can get it on steam.

1964
01:49:58,820 --> 01:49:59,320
All right.

1965
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:00,740
All right.

1966
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:05,140
Well, we've got some more stories coming up, but first, uh, some quick, some quick hits

1967
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,580
in rapid fire news.

1968
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:07,080
Loki.

1969
01:50:08,180 --> 01:50:08,820
Yes.

1970
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:10,660
So more TV talk.

1971
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:18,820
Um, it was just teased that a Twisted Metal TV series is coming to Peacock in July.

1972
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:23,300
That I just noticed that there's a teaser trailer for it too.

1973
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:31,860
Now it has Anthony Mackie in it who I like because he's, you know, when he's the new

1974
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:32,900
captain America.

1975
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:41,940
Um, but I'm hesitant that this will be good, but I'll watch it.

1976
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:46,020
Um, it's also going to have, oh, actually it has some decent people.

1977
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:50,340
So it says along with that, it's going to have, uh, Stephanie Beatrice, who's in Brooklyn

1978
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:53,220
nine nine, Thomas Hayden church, who was in Spiderman.

1979
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:56,820
Um, Neve Campbell also in there as well.

1980
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:00,340
And will Arnett is going to be doing the voice of sweet tooth.

1981
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,100
All right.

1982
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:04,980
I hope it's good.

1983
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:07,140
I probably won't watch it, but that's fine.

1984
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:08,420
I do love Neve Campbell though.

1985
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,300
So never say never.

1986
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:10,440
Yeah.

1987
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:18,920
Um, also we got some more look at the new donkey Kong sets that are coming from Lego

1988
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:19,640
in August.

1989
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:26,120
And, um, so they have a whole bunch of, well, they're, they're teasing the different family

1990
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,000
members in there as well.

1991
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:31,560
So we got, you know, Craigie Kong, funky calling and duty calling in there as well as donkey

1992
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:31,800
calling.

1993
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,240
And I, I saw him somewhere else.

1994
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,720
Oh, and, um, what was it?

1995
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:36,920
Daisy Kong as well.

1996
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:41,000
I know somewhere else though, I actually saw what the sets looked like.

1997
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:47,720
Um, it's probably on one of the Lego blogs that I read occasionally, but, um, they look

1998
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:49,800
pretty cool from what I remember.

1999
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:56,440
Um, they've got, I remember like the donkey Kong set has like his tree house and everything.

2000
01:51:56,440 --> 01:52:00,680
Um, they even have like bongos and stuff like that.

2001
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,400
It'll, it'll be interesting.

2002
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,880
I don't really understand how that's going to play out yet.

2003
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:11,160
Like I stopped, we stopped collecting the Mario sets because like the whole game behind

2004
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:12,200
it is really boring.

2005
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:18,760
You're supposed to just like set up this like large stage and just like hop your character

2006
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,720
around the game points.

2007
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:21,000
And it's really dumb.

2008
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,960
Um, it's all just to sell more Legos.

2009
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:28,600
It is, but they're not like good display sets either, which is kind of unfortunate because

2010
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,640
it's more based around the game.

2011
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:34,280
Like if it was just display stuff, like, like the Sonic the Hedgehog things, for example,

2012
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:36,200
like now those are actual sets.

2013
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,320
Like that's cool.

2014
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:42,440
Um, but like if it's just, I wish they would do that with the Mario stuff as well.

2015
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:46,680
And Donkey Kong where it's like actual like sets and not just like, okay, let's play this

2016
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:50,440
game because like they have so many expansions for it now.

2017
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:53,400
Like if you were to set it all up, like there's no room to do it.

2018
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,680
It's just too big.

2019
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,000
And, and the gameplay itself is not fun.

2020
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,480
And, and they also don't include manuals with any of it.

2021
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,200
You have to use an app, which is not optimized.

2022
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,240
So it drains your phone.

2023
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:04,520
So that's also fun.

2024
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:11,560
Um, it's just a pain to build stuff because it's through the app, but, um, yeah, I'll

2025
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:14,360
look forward to looking at them, you know, in the store shelves.

2026
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:15,560
Cause that's what I do nowadays.

2027
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:16,840
I'm like, Oh, cool.

2028
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:17,080
Yeah.

2029
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:18,040
Wish I could afford that.

2030
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:20,700
Kinda.

2031
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:21,800
All right.

2032
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,000
Uh, dark soccer.

2033
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:31,640
So, um, the, uh, PlayStation plus games for May are looking pretty interesting.

2034
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:37,160
It looks like there's going to be grid legends, which is a racing game with the story.

2035
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:44,840
Um, and then, uh, there's also descenders where you are, it's a, it's a bike racing

2036
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:45,340
game.

2037
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:52,200
Um, and then there's also a chivalry too, where it's night on night action.

2038
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:52,700
Bonk.

2039
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:56,140
All right.

2040
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:01,240
Um, well it's, uh, only humanity is going to be in there too.

2041
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:01,740
Yeah.

2042
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:05,880
Uh, it's a little, Oh, I'm glad they're going to do that one after all.

2043
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:09,480
That's, uh, um, enhances latest game.

2044
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:12,440
I, there was rumors that was going to end up being a PlayStation plus titles.

2045
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,080
That's pretty cool.

2046
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:14,040
I'll have to check that out.

2047
01:54:14,760 --> 01:54:15,260
Okay.

2048
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,800
Um, let's talk about this game.

2049
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:21,480
Cause this is only a little over a month away from release and that's Diablo four,

2050
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,480
believe it or not finally happening.

2051
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:25,640
Uh, they added a new beta weekend.

2052
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:27,320
I think we talked about that previously.

2053
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:30,440
It's going to be, they're calling it the server slam weekend.

2054
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:35,240
But in the server slam weekend, you're going to get some more tweaked kind of

2055
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,200
graphic settings.

2056
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,080
They're calling these the final PC system requirements.

2057
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:44,600
And they're basing this off data from the early access and open beta weekends to try

2058
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:49,240
to kind of give, you know, push you into whichever, uh, graphic settings would be

2059
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:50,760
the best for you.

2060
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:52,920
I'm not going to, I mean, this has been a lot for me to read.

2061
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:57,000
So just at a high level, I'll mention the minimum specifications.

2062
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:04,280
You'll have to have at least an Intel I five 2,500 or an AMD FX 80, three 50, eight gigs

2063
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:05,320
of Ram minimum.

2064
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:10,040
And you have to have at least an Nvidia G force GTX six 60 or an AMD radio on our nine

2065
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:10,760
two 80.

2066
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:11,080
Okay.

2067
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:16,280
That's the minimum maximum you want to play this ultra four K 60 frames a second.

2068
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:24,760
You're going to need an Intel I seven 8,700 or an AMD Ryzen seven 2,700 32 gigs of Ram

2069
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:31,720
and either an Nvidia G force RTX 30 80 G force RTX 40 series.

2070
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:39,400
If you want DLSS three or at AMD Radeon RX 6,800, no matter which version you take,

2071
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:42,040
you're going to need 90 gigabytes of space.

2072
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,480
That's what you're going to need for all of the versions.

2073
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:51,000
So, uh, Blizzard did say Diablo four will still attempt to run, even if you have below

2074
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:55,800
the minimum specifications, but the game experience may be diminished.

2075
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:58,040
So at least it's not as bad as Star Wars.

2076
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:02,920
Was it with 150 gigabyte install and 128 gigabyte patch?

2077
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:03,560
Yeah.

2078
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:07,400
So, well, we don't know what the patch is going to look like for Diablo, but, uh, I

2079
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:09,560
imagine it's probably going to have a pretty big patch as well.

2080
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:14,120
So, um, and Questbuster does point out there are some freebies you can carry into the main

2081
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,760
game in this beta, like a title and some cosmetics.

2082
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:17,160
Yes.

2083
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:21,800
And if you didn't get the stuff the first time you can get it this time and they added

2084
01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:23,800
a new one to try to get people to play again.

2085
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:28,680
There's something from beating the world boss, uh, that you can carry in the main game.

2086
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:31,400
And I forget what it is in the moment, but it's, it's another cosmetic.

2087
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:36,920
So, all right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

2088
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:39,560
We'll start with the U S and what's coming to store shelves this week.

2089
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:45,000
Not a lot this week, but we've got age of wonders four on PC PlayStation five and Xbox

2090
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:55,800
series, red fall on PC and Xbox series, uh, Raven Oak on the PC, uh, Xbox one and Xbox

2091
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,200
series.

2092
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:02,680
Um, I guess let's wave Raven lock my mistake, uh, death or treat.

2093
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:08,760
I love that name on PC PlayStation five and Xbox series Hogwarts legacy coming to PlayStation

2094
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,120
four and Xbox one.

2095
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:11,080
And that's it.

2096
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:13,000
All right.

2097
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,640
Well, traveling to Japan and checking out the releases there.

2098
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:21,320
If you might, you might recall last week, I said it is that it is finally that week.

2099
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:23,000
Are there any new games this week?

2100
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,560
Not really why it's golden week in Japan.

2101
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:31,240
So, uh, there really isn't anything coming out, but I will point out that there is actually

2102
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,480
one release randomly on the PlayStation five.

2103
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:39,240
I'm not sure why it's happening right now, but it is a game called TT Isle of man ride

2104
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:42,760
on the edge three that it's a, it's a motocross type of game.

2105
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:44,840
It's a motorbike simulator racer game.

2106
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:48,760
That's the one game that is daring to release this week on the fifth.

2107
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:49,640
Um, but that is it.

2108
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:54,440
Otherwise that's probably, probably why, uh, you're seeing a pretty dry calendar and

2109
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:55,720
other region regions too.

2110
01:57:55,720 --> 01:58:00,280
I will take this opportunity to remind that because it is golden week in Japan, a lot

2111
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:02,200
of places are having sales like dark soccer.

2112
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:06,440
You pointed out in chat steam is actually selling Catherine tonight's classic game

2113
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:10,280
selection for five bucks as a tie into a golden week sale.

2114
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:15,240
I haven't seen a similar sale on PlayStation's front yet, but one might be coming this week

2115
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:18,920
because technically I think it starts started yesterday or today.

2116
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:25,480
There's it's company wide for, um, for Sega and also Capcom sent out an email, um, that

2117
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:30,040
some of their games, both physical and digital are also on various sales.

2118
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:36,120
Um, but, uh, like I actually, even though I already have the PS four version, I picked

2119
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:43,320
up a PPO Tetris for five bucks and, and then the sequel for, I think six.

2120
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:43,820
Yeah.

2121
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:48,120
So, I mean, there's some pretty good sales on there for games.

2122
01:58:48,120 --> 01:58:53,160
Like the whole Etrian Odyssey collection is like 80 bucks for the whole thing.

2123
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:53,660
Wow.

2124
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:57,480
Valkyria Chronicle collection is like 15.

2125
01:58:57,480 --> 01:58:57,980
Yeah.

2126
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,040
So yeah, so there was some pretty good stuff on there and devolver is also having a sale

2127
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:03,240
just putting that out.

2128
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:06,120
So if you want cult of the lamb, it's 16 bucks right now.

2129
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:08,600
And there is a bunch of new stuff that just came out for it.

2130
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:09,480
If you have the DLC.

2131
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:10,540
Nice.

2132
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:13,800
And as I mentioned earlier in the show, I don't think it has anything to do a golden

2133
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:17,800
week and I don't even know if this deal is still available, but I did pick up stranger

2134
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:20,040
paradise final fantasy origin for 20 bucks.

2135
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:21,960
It finally hit that sweet spot for me.

2136
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:24,840
Um, it was, it's only certain sites.

2137
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:28,520
So Amazon target and Walmart all have it for 20 bucks.

2138
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:31,000
Best buy for whatever reason didn't, I don't know why.

2139
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:36,600
And then Amazon was sold out of the PS five version, but public service announcement.

2140
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:41,480
If you really want the PS five version, the PS four version has a completely free upgrade.

2141
01:59:41,480 --> 01:59:44,840
You just have to have the disc in the drive when you play it, which whatever you'd have

2142
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,600
to do that with a PS five version anyway.

2143
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:48,840
So it works all the same as far as I'm concerned.

2144
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:52,840
So, uh, that I will definitely be streaming that probably Tuesday.

2145
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:57,320
I think Monday I'm going to do a theater of them stream again because I'm the deals.

2146
01:59:57,320 --> 02:00:01,800
I never did a stream of the DLC because I was so focused on final fantasy pixel remaster

2147
02:00:01,800 --> 02:00:04,200
and something I had a, I had a really big week at my day job.

2148
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,880
So I'm, I was really focused on that.

2149
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:09,480
So we'll get back to the stream this week.

2150
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:11,880
We'll do, we'll do as 200 Matt does point out.

2151
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,400
Best buy should price match.

2152
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:14,680
I didn't test that.

2153
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:20,360
Um, but I, I, uh, a certain friend of mine that is always influencing me to buy games

2154
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:23,480
had suggested the same thing when I was like, well, I don't want to get it cause the PS

2155
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:24,920
five version is gone.

2156
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:30,200
Um, so, but then I learned the PS four version is essentially the same thing.

2157
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:30,600
All right.

2158
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:32,920
We almost skipped the UK.

2159
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:33,640
I don't want to do that.

2160
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:34,280
Dark Sakura.

2161
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:39,320
There's only one game I am not going to say the name of because I don't believe it should

2162
02:00:39,320 --> 02:00:41,720
have any press or anyone should be supporting.

2163
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:45,000
Oh, that game on lesser platforms.

2164
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,120
If I remember calling, right?

2165
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:46,920
Yeah.

2166
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:50,040
It will be out on May 5th for PlayStation and Xbox.

2167
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:55,560
But if I, I, I do not support anyone supporting that.

2168
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:56,060
Sorry.

2169
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:58,600
Um, actually I'm not sorry.

2170
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:00,360
I'm really not sorry at all to say that.

2171
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:01,880
I'm sorry that it has to be said.

2172
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:10,200
Um, so on May 2nd, red fall is coming out for Xbox on the fifth, a Trek to Yomi is coming

2173
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,080
out on PlayStation.

2174
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:15,320
Um, on the fifth on PlayStation, turn it boy commits tax evasion.

2175
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:17,960
I just think that's the best name ever.

2176
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:18,600
Yeah, that's pretty good.

2177
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:22,440
Yeah, I think I had the game on Stadia.

2178
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:29,160
Um, but any, anyway, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a cute RPG type game.

2179
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,000
Um, but yeah, that's, that's it.

2180
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,840
I mean, the other stuff coming out of the month is of course, we've got, uh, tears of

2181
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:35,480
the kingdom.

2182
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:37,880
We have a bubble bobble, every bubble.

2183
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:39,560
Try saying that three times fast.

2184
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,060
I love it.

2185
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:41,340
Yeah.

2186
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:47,560
Releases are picking up with, uh, when that Zelda game hits boy, we're getting into the

2187
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:48,360
summers.

2188
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:49,480
Summer is stacked.

2189
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:54,440
Stacked puzzle, puzzle, bubble, puzzle, bubble, every bubble.

2190
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:59,080
I'm actually, I'm actually pretty happy.

2191
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:04,040
It's got, it's the Japanese name puzzle bobble instead of best to move.

2192
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,120
Cause there's only one bus to move me in my heart.

2193
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:08,440
I think at some point they finally did revert.

2194
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:10,120
I don't think this is the first game to come out.

2195
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:11,080
Not called bus to move.

2196
02:02:11,080 --> 02:02:13,880
I feel like they did revert that finally at some point.

2197
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,840
I think it was like the, there was iOS game that was like the puzzle bobble map, weird

2198
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:19,800
buy our stuff game.

2199
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:26,920
Um, but, but yeah, um, I always thought puzzle bobble was a better name, you know, cause

2200
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:30,920
there was only one bus to move and it involves dancing and roller skates for the second one.

2201
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:35,960
All right, let's move on and get into some more news.

2202
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:40,840
We'll also be taking discord calls later in the show over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

2203
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:43,320
That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

2204
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,960
But even if you're not here live on Sunday night, I would encourage you to head over

2205
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:48,120
there throughout the week and chat with us.

2206
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,360
Let's get into some more stories.

2207
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:50,860
Loki.

2208
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:52,040
Yeah.

2209
02:02:52,040 --> 02:03:00,760
So there is more talk about the ROG Ally, which is a kind of steam deck handheld competitor

2210
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:02,760
by Asus.

2211
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:05,880
And, um, it looks pretty cool.

2212
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:08,600
We now know kind of what the price might be.

2213
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,720
Thanks to a leak.

2214
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:13,400
According to the leak, it says that the price is supposed to be $699.

2215
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:17,080
Um, it looks cool.

2216
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:20,520
Like spec wise, it's supposed to run games better than the steam deck.

2217
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:25,720
And I know it's been on different tech, uh, content creator channels and stuff like that.

2218
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:28,040
They were like kind of showing off some of the stuff with it.

2219
02:03:28,040 --> 02:03:33,720
But, um, yeah, I mean, they said, of course that, you know, the leak also says that I

2220
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:38,680
can play, um, you know, obviously any of the, uh, streaming platforms.

2221
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:42,520
They said, Xbox game, fast G-force now, Google game, steam windows.

2222
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:44,280
I mean, of course it's raining windows.

2223
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:45,320
So why wouldn't it?

2224
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:52,360
Um, I don't remember what, I don't know if we know what the specs were of that yet.

2225
02:03:52,360 --> 02:04:02,280
Uh, they said it houses an AMD Z1 extreme and a 512 gigabyte NVMe M2 SSD, 16 gigs of,

2226
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:04,280
uh, DDR5 RAM.

2227
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:05,480
That's not bad.

2228
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:07,560
Um, it looks cool.

2229
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:11,160
It's also expensive, but it looks cool.

2230
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:11,400
Yeah.

2231
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:15,960
It's a little pricey, but, um, you know, the handheld element is pretty big deal.

2232
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:16,280
Yeah.

2233
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:19,880
It sounds like it's going to be, you know, it'll probably run your switch games better

2234
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:20,680
than your switch.

2235
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:23,640
So, you know, that's the sad thing about it.

2236
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:29,240
If you want to play modded, uh, Zelda that, uh, Nintendo doesn't want you to see, uh,

2237
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:31,240
this might be the system to do it with.

2238
02:04:31,320 --> 02:04:32,920
Asus do it, Nintendo don't.

2239
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:34,520
All right.

2240
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:37,720
Speaking of things Nintendo doesn't want you to see, Dark Sakura.

2241
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:40,440
Okay.

2242
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:45,960
So, um, you know, and this is actually, I guess, sort of outside of the spirit of the

2243
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:52,200
old Giga leak, you know, but, um, they found a Game & Watch Tetris prototype.

2244
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:54,280
It's a dual screen.

2245
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:58,760
Um, and it, it looks pretty, pretty neat.

2246
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:04,440
I mean, the Game & Watch were the LCDs, you know, that just like, like tiger toy style,

2247
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:04,760
right?

2248
02:05:04,760 --> 02:05:05,240
Yeah.

2249
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:11,800
Um, you know, monochrome and, um, but this one was actually full on Tetris.

2250
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:15,960
Um, it it's in the safe Buster shell.

2251
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:22,440
Um, but if it is real, then that means that they were working on the concept of it.

2252
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:28,840
I don't, it's coming from a Japanese Twitter post Vectrex 0 9 0 4.

2253
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:34,840
Um, but I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they were going to try to do a Tetris, but

2254
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:36,600
I don't know why it would have been a dual screen.

2255
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:38,600
Sorry.

2256
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:41,640
The sound for the, I was trying to play the video for people and the sound came in.

2257
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:41,960
Sorry.

2258
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:48,120
Oh, but yeah, let me, let me see what, what this, uh, what this says.

2259
02:05:48,760 --> 02:05:50,120
Oh, come on.

2260
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:52,040
Why are you open Twitter?

2261
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:57,880
I was going to be about having it translate the tweet so that I can see what it, what

2262
02:05:57,880 --> 02:06:01,160
it says is I read like a semi-literate five-year-old.

2263
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:07,240
Um, it's the Nintendo Game Watch playthrough of the Phantom Tetris prototype.

2264
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
What's interesting about this, just looking at it is that the well is very different from

2265
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,280
a typical Tetris game.

2266
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:18,920
And then most of all is the whole, like, you can move all of the blocks left and right,

2267
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:25,400
which seems kind of, it almost, it looks more like luminous to me, but like, if you

2268
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:28,360
could move all of the pieces to the left or the right, I don't know.

2269
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:28,920
It's weird.

2270
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,360
It's, it's, I can see why they didn't go with it.

2271
02:06:32,360 --> 02:06:35,560
It's, it's too different from, from a regular Tetris, I think.

2272
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:43,640
So, uh, there's, uh, there's actually from another post from a hero, Papa, uh, zero,

2273
02:06:43,640 --> 02:06:49,240
zero, um, it says introducing rare items on the occasion of the release of electronic

2274
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:50,920
game machine super guide.

2275
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:55,880
This is the prototype of the discontinued game and watch version of Tetris and it's different

2276
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:56,920
pictures of it.

2277
02:06:57,560 --> 02:07:00,120
Um, and different contents.

2278
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:03,640
So yeah, it's looking kind of legit.

2279
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:06,440
I don't know.

2280
02:07:06,440 --> 02:07:12,600
Maybe, um, I'll, I'll, what I'll do, and I'm sorry people, but the, um, you know, how Twitter

2281
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:14,440
posts are, they have the very long name.

2282
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:22,440
I'll post it in our chat here and I'll repost it on my Twitter so that people can see.

2283
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,080
All right, let's move on.

2284
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:33,560
I'm talking about other, uh, items that are making their way to retailers finally, right

2285
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:34,120
Loki?

2286
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:40,280
I mean, we'll see how, how much to make it to retailers, but apparently the PlayStation

2287
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:44,920
VR two is supposed to be hitting retail shelves at some point.

2288
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:45,800
I literally forgot.

2289
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:50,200
I just want to point out, I literally forgot the PS VR two existed until now.

2290
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:57,080
I mean, so it's, it's supposed according to, uh, the UK retailer shop too.

2291
02:07:57,080 --> 02:08:03,000
They've suggested that it's going to be in stock starting May 12th, allegedly.

2292
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:10,040
But to, to that I say, so like, I mean,

2293
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:12,680
is it really in that much demand right now?

2294
02:08:12,680 --> 02:08:15,560
Like, I honestly can't imagine this flying off shelves.

2295
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:17,560
I don't know.

2296
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:20,600
I, I, yeah, again, what are people buying these for?

2297
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:24,920
I don't know, but I mean, PlayStation fives themselves are certainly like, they're, you

2298
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:27,000
don't have to try too hard to find those anymore.

2299
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,320
Yeah, I've seen some in like some of the targets, not the one I normally go to, but I've seen

2300
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:35,160
them like occasionally.

2301
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:38,520
Um, but yeah, I mean, cool.

2302
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:40,360
I don't know.

2303
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:43,080
And Shane says, I haven't played mine in forever.

2304
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:45,480
And you, you never did even play no man's sky.

2305
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:46,440
Did you Shane?

2306
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:57,000
Uh, anyway, like I, I do, I would love to try that, that new, um, you know, spiritual

2307
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:03,800
successor to, um, the, the game I loved on PlayStation VR, but like me.

2308
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:07,800
Oh, um, you're talking about the until dawn Russian blood.

2309
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:08,200
Yeah.

2310
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:08,440
Yeah.

2311
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:09,640
Until dawn Russian blood.

2312
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,280
Yeah.

2313
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:13,800
Like I'd be, I'd be cool to check it out, but like, that's more of like a, I want to

2314
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:14,280
check it out.

2315
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:21,160
Like at a, one of those, you know, on tour Sony things, like I'll check it out there

2316
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,760
and like check it out.

2317
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:28,680
I'm not going to check it out with a deposit of, you know, thousand dollars, $1,100 to

2318
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:29,320
play this thing.

2319
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,680
No, bring the PC, please.

2320
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:38,520
I'll, I'll play it on PC, but I, I'm not paying that kind of money.

2321
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:39,080
No, thank you.

2322
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:41,560
Uh, Shane does point out switch back.

2323
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:45,160
The game you're trying to think of was the game, which was the game I played the most

2324
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:46,360
on, on PSVR too.

2325
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:49,080
And Bobby says that people are buying it for Gran Turismo seven.

2326
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:51,000
I guess I could see that if you're, I could see that.

2327
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,360
Yeah, I see that.

2328
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:55,400
I just don't think it's a lot of people, you know?

2329
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:57,160
Yes, there is an audience for it.

2330
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:59,160
It's not a gigantic audience or just nothing.

2331
02:09:59,160 --> 02:10:01,960
That's really like screaming like, Oh my God, I got to get it for this.

2332
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:07,960
Switchback VR is cool, but like it, you need more, like the horizon game was even just

2333
02:10:07,960 --> 02:10:12,760
kind of, it's a nice tech demo, but it's not a great game.

2334
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:16,920
Like I need something a little bit more substantial.

2335
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:17,160
Yeah.

2336
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:20,200
Bobby and Chad says there's no killer app for PSVR too.

2337
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:21,240
Yeah, it's, it's, that's it.

2338
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:22,680
There's no like killer app.

2339
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:24,280
There's no Wii Sports, right?

2340
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:27,240
I'm kind of holding out actually for like a quest three.

2341
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,840
Like I'm curious to see what that looks like.

2342
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:33,080
Cause my kids' quest twos, like I've, I've used them a little bit while I set them up

2343
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,120
and they're pretty nice.

2344
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:35,000
Like it's not bad.

2345
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:40,600
Like I have like a, uh, was it the Rift S or whatever, but that thing's pretty old at

2346
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:41,240
this point.

2347
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:47,160
And you know, I have a PlayStation VR as well, but like my computer is like, it can crank

2348
02:10:47,160 --> 02:10:48,520
out VR like nothing.

2349
02:10:48,520 --> 02:10:52,920
And I've been building a library as I do in Steam.

2350
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:57,960
Um, but it would be nice to have some like modern hardware that could run it.

2351
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:01,800
Uh, that I would play for like five minutes and then put it back in the box.

2352
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:02,920
I, I have a callback.

2353
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:06,840
I have a callback to something at the top of the show that I'm dying to get out here

2354
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:07,480
with this story.

2355
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:09,480
Cause it's, I just had an aha moment.

2356
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:10,120
Okay.

2357
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:16,520
So if Sony were to try to buy another studio that makes a VR game, shouldn't the UK block

2358
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:21,640
that because it's to allow Microsoft to compete in that space?

2359
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:26,200
To allow Nintendo to compete in that space?

2360
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:32,520
If PlayStation wants to buy a company that makes VR games, shouldn't that be blocked

2361
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:37,000
under the same logic that the UK blocked the Microsoft Activision deal?

2362
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:40,360
I mean, none of it makes sense.

2363
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:41,160
So sure.

2364
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:41,960
I mean, why not?

2365
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:45,480
I know, no, it doesn't make sense, but that's my point because I'm looking at that going,

2366
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:51,240
well, Microsoft actively chose to pursue AR and then decided not to go down that route

2367
02:11:51,240 --> 02:11:52,120
at least for gaming.

2368
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:56,040
I know they do it for other stuff, but, uh, they decided not to go down that route.

2369
02:11:56,520 --> 02:12:03,080
Microsoft and Nintendo kind of had that fold paper box VR thing.

2370
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:04,040
It was, it's throw away.

2371
02:12:04,040 --> 02:12:04,520
It was nothing.

2372
02:12:04,520 --> 02:12:11,720
It's a non-issue, you know, as these companies are choosing not to participate here.

2373
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:16,200
SSG100Matt says, if Sony wants to be sassy, Rob will sass back.

2374
02:12:16,200 --> 02:12:18,040
Hire Rob, Microsoft.

2375
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:19,000
That's sweet of you to say.

2376
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I will say I have some friends who are getting good things for them.

2377
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:23,720
It's Microsoft.

2378
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:24,600
So that's great.

2379
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:27,160
But I, I like my current day job is fine.

2380
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:29,160
You know why my current day job is great?

2381
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:32,040
Because I can separate it from all of this.

2382
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:34,920
That's, that's great.

2383
02:12:34,920 --> 02:12:37,400
So it allows me to continue to be impartial.

2384
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:38,600
So, all right.

2385
02:12:40,440 --> 02:12:43,000
Oh no, I just saw something terrible.

2386
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:43,800
Oh no, who died?

2387
02:12:44,920 --> 02:12:49,320
No one, well, it's a site, um, forest of illusion closed.

2388
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:51,000
Oh yeah.

2389
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:52,760
I was trying.

2390
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:53,080
Okay.

2391
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:58,760
So we actually had a story, um, uh, dark to see it submitted a story about that, but I

2392
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:00,600
couldn't get on the site while I was prepping.

2393
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:06,920
So I had to cut the story, but I guess they had some ROM of like a hotel and 64 collection.

2394
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,680
Here I am getting in the story anyway.

2395
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:11,880
That was like a part of that, but yeah, they're, they're gone now.

2396
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:14,760
So that's terrible.

2397
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:15,400
Yeah.

2398
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:17,640
And their YouTube and Twitter accounts are gone too.

2399
02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:18,940
Yeah.

2400
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:20,380
All right.

2401
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:24,460
Well, this is something that isn't gone yet, but it's probably going to be pretty soon.

2402
02:13:24,460 --> 02:13:28,460
And that is, uh, the game Portopia.

2403
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:32,860
It is, if you don't know the name of the game, I don't blame you.

2404
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:36,780
This is Square Enix's AI tech preview game.

2405
02:13:38,140 --> 02:13:39,340
So what happened?

2406
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:44,620
Square Enix did a remastered version of the Portopia serial murder case, and it was to

2407
02:13:44,620 --> 02:13:46,220
showcase AI.

2408
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,580
That preview is out now.

2409
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:50,620
This was a classic adventure game from the eighties.

2410
02:13:50,620 --> 02:13:54,380
It was authored by Yuji Horii, who you probably know from Dragon Quest.

2411
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:57,260
And this is now actually the first official release of the game in the West.

2412
02:13:57,900 --> 02:14:01,100
Technically, uh, this is a text adventure.

2413
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:03,180
So it like parses text, right?

2414
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:06,460
So you either type things in or you use speech to text in the game.

2415
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:11,500
And in this game, you are a junior detective and, you know, do this whole thing.

2416
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:16,780
But AI tech is through NLP, natural language processing.

2417
02:14:17,260 --> 02:14:21,420
So basically, you know, if you think about those classic games like Zork and things like

2418
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:27,660
that, it's basically using AI to like translate what you're saying into the game's language

2419
02:14:27,660 --> 02:14:30,780
or, you know, that that's a really rough way to pretty much say it.

2420
02:14:31,340 --> 02:14:38,540
So, um, yeah, uh, I guess originally there was even going to be natural replies for

2421
02:14:38,540 --> 02:14:43,180
situations where the system didn't have a preordained answer, but they were worried

2422
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:46,940
about unethical replies because, you know, somebody would get this game to say something

2423
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:50,460
really, really bad, and then there'd be a clip of it all over the internet.

2424
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:53,660
So Square rightfully kind of walked away from that.

2425
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:56,060
But how is this going?

2426
02:14:56,620 --> 02:15:01,420
Well, the tech preview is up and it has a 10% positive review rating on Steam.

2427
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:06,460
Most are finding frustration with the AI partner saying that basically,

2428
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:08,780
Yasu gets stuck in response loops.

2429
02:15:09,020 --> 02:15:12,380
So some people have jumped in and played the game and said, yeah, it just,

2430
02:15:12,380 --> 02:15:18,460
so for example, I can, so you ask a question, like, was the murder weapon found at the scene?

2431
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:20,940
It doesn't know what to do with it.

2432
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:22,620
Did the victim live alone?

2433
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,660
Doesn't know what to do with it.

2434
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:26,140
So it's, it's just, it's not smart enough.

2435
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:32,860
Like people, people are trying to make AI happen like way ahead where it's, and of course,

2436
02:15:33,820 --> 02:15:40,140
we all know it's really, it's a machine learning or as I call it autocomplete.

2437
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:47,020
All of this AI stuff is like that autocomplete shit that shows up on, you know, uh, Gmail.

2438
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:51,180
It's gone, gone way too far, turned up to 11.

2439
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:57,900
It's like if the NYPD had a bring your kid to work day and they made this like top

2440
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:00,300
detective's partner a two-year-old.

2441
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:10,140
No, cause then the game would just be like, why, why, why, why it's a, it's a baby in a stroller.

2442
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:15,660
Uh, fixation gaze and chat says I'm honestly way too tired of AI.

2443
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:16,160
Same.

2444
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:18,060
This is a buzzword.

2445
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:20,220
I'm just, I'm already exhausted.

2446
02:16:21,020 --> 02:16:24,460
Like we're not ready for autocomplete to run society.

2447
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:24,860
Stop.

2448
02:16:24,860 --> 02:16:30,220
I still found it creepy doing the voice thing today.

2449
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:31,980
I don't.

2450
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:33,500
And some of that, I don't know.

2451
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:34,540
I don't, I don't know.

2452
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:39,500
Cause that means you could like have people that are no longer with us having their voice again.

2453
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:40,300
I don't know.

2454
02:16:40,300 --> 02:16:43,260
Maybe for historical figures that could be interesting, but I,

2455
02:16:44,460 --> 02:16:46,860
there's something about that that just weirds me out.

2456
02:16:46,860 --> 02:16:48,220
Maybe, maybe I just need to get over it.

2457
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:48,720
I don't know.

2458
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:54,220
So, well, it, the ones that I did for me, like it doesn't really

2459
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:58,780
even sound much like me and all I had to do was change certain inflections

2460
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:00,620
and it sounded completely different.

2461
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:05,340
So I think we're still a far away from it being super believable.

2462
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:05,840
Yep.

2463
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:07,420
All right.

2464
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:11,180
Well, with that, that was the last story that we had slotted for tonight.

2465
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:13,020
So we're going to get to the listener round table.

2466
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:17,500
And this is the part of the show where we invite your feedback via not just the chat room.

2467
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:21,180
If you have some questions there, but you can also call in over at vognetwork.com

2468
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:23,660
slash discord, and you can email us.

2469
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:27,020
Participate at orange launch radio.com is place to email us.

2470
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:29,340
I think we actually did get an email earlier in the week.

2471
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:30,380
Didn't we, Darce Chakra?

2472
02:17:30,380 --> 02:17:31,980
We did actually.

2473
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:32,940
Should I go ahead and read?

2474
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:33,180
I know.

2475
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:37,260
I feel like I, I just hope this wasn't just because of my threats last week,

2476
02:17:37,260 --> 02:17:39,500
but I appreciate the gesture all the same.

2477
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:40,000
Thank you.

2478
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:42,220
Yeah, please read it.

2479
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:42,720
Yeah.

2480
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:47,340
Well, as soon as it loads up, our mail site is not the fastest.

2481
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,140
Oh, it logged me out.

2482
02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:48,940
No wonder.

2483
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:51,340
Well then let me give a shout out one more time for that email address.

2484
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:51,840
I've got it.

2485
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:53,660
Participate at orange launch radio.com.

2486
02:17:55,980 --> 02:17:56,460
Hi, all.

2487
02:17:56,460 --> 02:18:00,300
Decided to drop this week's question in mail, in the mail.

2488
02:18:00,300 --> 02:18:04,460
So my gaming week consisted of cross code, which is a pixelated game about an avatar

2489
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:08,620
who doesn't remember who she is or what she's doing in the location that she's in.

2490
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:08,940
Sorry.

2491
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:11,740
Trying to be as vague as possible in case someone wants to play the game too.

2492
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:14,780
It gives the feel of a game within a game.

2493
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:18,460
As you play the game, you learn you're an avatar in an MMO.

2494
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:24,060
Basically, the story surrounds itself that the character, as she tries to regain her memories,

2495
02:18:24,060 --> 02:18:29,580
the next game I played is called Homestead Arcana, in which you play as a witch whose

2496
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:33,580
task is to fix the land around her aunt's farm that has been corrupted by miasma,

2497
02:18:34,620 --> 02:18:39,180
all while trying to discover what happened to her aunt who somehow mysteriously disappeared.

2498
02:18:39,180 --> 02:18:41,740
And last but not least, Ghostwire Tokyo.

2499
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:43,260
I've had that on my list for a bit.

2500
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:44,540
It definitely...

2501
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:47,660
Yeah, let me tell you that game is amazing.

2502
02:18:47,660 --> 02:18:50,220
It has minor challenges, but nothing game-breaking.

2503
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,660
The story is really well done.

2504
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:55,180
And being an open-world game, there's a lot to do within the game's six chapters.

2505
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:58,140
I hope you guys had a great gaming week too.

2506
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:01,180
Sincerely, Michi Kenz, aka Michi.

2507
02:19:02,140 --> 02:19:03,100
Thanks for the email, Mich.

2508
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:04,380
It's good to hear about your gaming week.

2509
02:19:04,380 --> 02:19:10,060
And yeah, I know in some of my personal streams, you and DT have brought up Ghostwire Tokyo.

2510
02:19:10,060 --> 02:19:14,060
And yeah, that game, you definitely have all put that on my radar for sure.

2511
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:15,740
It's nice that it's on Game Pass right now.

2512
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:19,340
Um, so yeah, I have to check that out at some point.

2513
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:20,640
For sure.

2514
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:24,940
So by the way, I went ahead and pulled up the...

2515
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:29,420
It's the Nintendo LodgeNet 64 gateway system.

2516
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:30,060
That was it.

2517
02:19:30,060 --> 02:19:30,620
Okay, yeah.

2518
02:19:31,420 --> 02:19:31,920
Yep.

2519
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:36,780
And yeah, they put the entire ROM catalog on there.

2520
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:41,340
And, but there were some games that said that was missing from it.

2521
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:47,340
Um, and going through the Wayback Machine, the link is completely broken.

2522
02:19:48,220 --> 02:19:48,940
Ah, okay.

2523
02:19:49,820 --> 02:19:55,420
But if anyone is interested, I know I won't have any ability to really, you know,

2524
02:19:55,420 --> 02:19:59,420
give the address to our podcast listeners.

2525
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:03,420
But I'll share the Wayback link in chat, and I'll put it on my Twitter.

2526
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:04,860
Awesome, awesome.

2527
02:20:06,060 --> 02:20:06,860
All right.

2528
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:08,540
Well, thank you very much for the email, Mich.

2529
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:12,380
And by the way, I have played that CrossCode game as well.

2530
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,860
You'd have to go back a ways to when that game first came out on Game Pass,

2531
02:20:14,860 --> 02:20:16,700
but I didn't get very far.

2532
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,820
I probably need to revisit it.

2533
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:21,820
But you know, then a shiny new game comes out or a shiny old game

2534
02:20:21,820 --> 02:20:23,660
recaptures my attention like Skyrim.

2535
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:25,340
And then it's like, I never finished what I start.

2536
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:28,140
So that's why committing to beating...

2537
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:29,340
I used to be very...

2538
02:20:29,340 --> 02:20:31,500
And this is just a personal thing I had to get over.

2539
02:20:32,060 --> 02:20:35,580
I used to be very against playing narrative games on stream,

2540
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:40,780
because I don't always love to pick up a game part way through as a viewer,

2541
02:20:40,780 --> 02:20:42,940
because I don't understand what happened to get to that point.

2542
02:20:43,660 --> 02:20:46,860
But I've kind of found that especially through some classic games,

2543
02:20:46,860 --> 02:20:50,380
like the Final Fantasy Picture Remaster, it's whatever, you know,

2544
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:54,300
because at the end of the day, the game mechanics are still the same, right?

2545
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:55,580
So there's that.

2546
02:20:55,580 --> 02:20:59,020
So it's a little personal journey I'm going on, for whatever it's worth.

2547
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:02,300
I do have another story.

2548
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:02,940
Oh, please.

2549
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:04,620
Yeah, last minute stories are awesome.

2550
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:05,660
So go ahead, DarkSakura.

2551
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:09,020
So you know that terrible CDI Zelda game?

2552
02:21:09,980 --> 02:21:11,100
Unfortunately, yes, I do.

2553
02:21:12,140 --> 02:21:13,260
Well, there are two of them, right?

2554
02:21:14,860 --> 02:21:20,940
Well, I'm referring specifically to the Zelda Faces of Evil

2555
02:21:20,940 --> 02:21:23,020
and Zelda Wand of Gamelan together.

2556
02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:23,520
Okay.

2557
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:25,260
There was also...

2558
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:27,260
I mean, they're all pretty bad.

2559
02:21:27,980 --> 02:21:32,780
But someone has done a game called Zelda's Adventure based on those games

2560
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:35,020
as a demake for Game Boy.

2561
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:47,660
And just looking it over, it actually will work on an original Game Boy,

2562
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:53,820
if you've got a flash cart for it or other methods of playing it.

2563
02:21:55,580 --> 02:22:00,460
But it incorporates some of the features from Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons

2564
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:02,620
and uses the visual style of Link's Awakening.

2565
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:04,940
Those are good games.

2566
02:22:04,940 --> 02:22:06,860
I like the Oracle of Ages and Seasons.

2567
02:22:06,860 --> 02:22:11,580
And apparently people are saying that it's actually a pretty decent game.

2568
02:22:11,580 --> 02:22:12,080
Okay.

2569
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:15,260
Unlike the inspiration for it.

2570
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:17,340
That's okay.

2571
02:22:17,340 --> 02:22:19,900
Sometimes there's a good story to be found in there somewhere.

2572
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:21,900
Just thought I'd share.

2573
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:23,900
No, I appreciate the last minute story.

2574
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:25,980
Loki, did you have anything on your plate for last minute stories?

2575
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:30,860
Yeah, there's this cool mod that looks like it was showcased that

2576
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:31,360
uses...

2577
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:34,780
It's for Skyrim VR.

2578
02:22:34,780 --> 02:22:40,460
It uses ChatGPT to basically allow you to talk to NPCs in the game.

2579
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:45,500
And then they respond back with all sorts of randomly created dialogue, I guess.

2580
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:50,620
It's not great because it's slow.

2581
02:22:50,620 --> 02:22:55,980
But the dialogue is pretty good for an NPC.

2582
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:59,420
And they synthesize the voice using the NPC voices.

2583
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:01,980
Doesn't sound great because it is recreated with AI.

2584
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:05,020
But it's a thing.

2585
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:09,900
I'm really worried that in the next couple of years,

2586
02:23:09,900 --> 02:23:12,220
in some of these open world games that we're going to see,

2587
02:23:12,220 --> 02:23:17,820
we're going to see people try to use AI to sort of make an open world seem more open.

2588
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:23,260
I just, I would really caution the industry to implement something like this before it's ready.

2589
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:28,380
I think the narrative on this is moving way faster than it should be.

2590
02:23:28,460 --> 02:23:30,300
I don't think it's going to be.

2591
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:32,620
I mean, yeah, we probably will see that in a couple of years.

2592
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:34,700
But this is the worst it's ever going to be.

2593
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:38,700
So like, you know, it's only going to get better from here,

2594
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:40,700
and it's already gotten better so fast.

2595
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:45,340
So yeah, in a couple of years, it should be ready to rock.

2596
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:45,840
I don't know.

2597
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:49,100
But yeah, don't get me wrong.

2598
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:55,020
I fully intend, fully expect the game industry to screw it up somehow.

2599
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:58,780
Like, you know, it's publishers doing what publishers do best,

2600
02:23:58,780 --> 02:24:02,460
where they push games to be done before they're done.

2601
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:04,700
And so you get technical hitches.

2602
02:24:04,700 --> 02:24:12,380
And so yeah, you will end up, you know, with AI not acting correctly if they cut corners.

2603
02:24:13,660 --> 02:24:18,780
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Ubisoft already replaced their junior level writers with GPT.

2604
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:21,420
Well, Ubisoft is run by a fucking moron.

2605
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:23,100
Let me go on the record and say that too.

2606
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:26,860
Like, unfortunately, I'm not surprised to hear that.

2607
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:29,260
But they're going to pay the price when those games come out.

2608
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:34,780
And then Zen Monkey 11 follows that up with some friends of mine were in VR chat talking with AI,

2609
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:38,380
and it called one of them a slur we don't say ever.

2610
02:24:38,940 --> 02:24:41,180
So game devs need to be careful with that shit.

2611
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:41,820
Absolutely.

2612
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:45,180
And Ubisoft is going to get that in some clip of their game,

2613
02:24:45,180 --> 02:24:47,180
because they thought AI was a good idea.

2614
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:53,900
Like, Ubisoft is run by a fucking idiot.

2615
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:55,340
Quote it, put it on the back of the box.

2616
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:00,220
Anyway, any other last minute stories?

2617
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:02,700
No, that's it.

2618
02:25:02,700 --> 02:25:03,200
Okay.

2619
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:08,060
I am in agreement about fuckery.

2620
02:25:08,060 --> 02:25:08,560
Yeah.

2621
02:25:08,940 --> 02:25:09,180
All right.

2622
02:25:09,180 --> 02:25:11,580
Well, I'm sorry to leave things on a sour note tonight.

2623
02:25:11,580 --> 02:25:14,380
But I think that's all we have on our agenda tonight.

2624
02:25:14,380 --> 02:25:15,100
And you know what?

2625
02:25:15,100 --> 02:25:18,540
We didn't have any FUs of the Week music.

2626
02:25:18,540 --> 02:25:19,100
No, no.

2627
02:25:20,140 --> 02:25:21,820
And here's the whole thing.

2628
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:25,900
Bobby says in their defense, they're just using GPT to write the script for the random

2629
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:26,620
NPCs.

2630
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:28,620
They won't directly talk to GPT.

2631
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:30,380
Okay, today.

2632
02:25:33,020 --> 02:25:36,780
And even then, I just, I don't know.

2633
02:25:36,780 --> 02:25:40,220
It's, you can't replace artists.

2634
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:40,940
Stop trying.

2635
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:42,000
All right.

2636
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:46,960
That is all I have to say on that.

2637
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:50,720
Let's wrap things up for the night.

2638
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:51,200
You know what?

2639
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:54,800
I could honestly use a nap after last night, so I'm okay if we're done a little bit early

2640
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:55,300
tonight.

2641
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:58,880
But let's get on out of here for the night.

2642
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:01,680
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, please tell a friend or two about

2643
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:02,240
the show.

2644
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:05,200
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

2645
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:07,600
need more voices to put out here on air.

2646
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:12,320
So leave us a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you

2647
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:12,960
found this show.

2648
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:14,160
It goes an awful long way.

2649
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:17,120
Oh, I forgot to check Spotify to see if we had any comments.

2650
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:20,720
Leave us a comment on that thing that they added.

2651
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:25,440
So yeah, and I promise I'll check those this week.

2652
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:28,000
And yes, this is Joe 100 Matt says, join the Discord.

2653
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,120
All of those things.

2654
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:32,400
Okay, let's wrap up and get on out of here for the night.

2655
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:34,320
But Dark Sakura, you go first.

2656
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:35,280
Your final thought for the night.

2657
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:41,840
Um, I am, I don't know.

2658
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:47,760
I, I've, Gwen, you know, has been in a really bad state.

2659
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:54,400
And on my Twitter, I have linked her GoFundMe so that she can afford to pay her bills.

2660
02:26:56,560 --> 02:26:59,280
So I haven't heard from her in three days.

2661
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:01,200
And I'm really worried.

2662
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:08,640
So I would just say if anyone can do anything to help the link of it is a pinned post on

2663
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:11,040
my Twitter at Dark Sakura.

2664
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,120
And if anyone can do anything to help her out, I'd greatly appreciate it.

2665
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:20,080
Can you please let us know on the socials or Discord when you hear that's the that's

2666
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:21,280
an alarming thing to hear.

2667
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:22,080
I'm sorry to hear that.

2668
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,560
I'm really worried.

2669
02:27:24,560 --> 02:27:28,320
Yeah, I mean, she's she's had problems with depression for a while.

2670
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:30,480
And I know this is only making it worse.

2671
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:33,600
And I'm, I'm really worried.

2672
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:36,800
I mean, she's one of my longest friends.

2673
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:42,960
And, you know, she was, you know, worried that, you know, power would be shut down.

2674
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:44,320
No phone, no internet.

2675
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:49,040
And I mean, I know that there's, sorry, my notes are just grace periods, but I would

2676
02:27:49,040 --> 02:27:53,520
just really appreciate it that if there's anything that you contribute, even if it's

2677
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:59,040
just reposting the link for my Twitter, I would greatly appreciate it to spread the

2678
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:03,120
word and we needed to have the money already raised by now.

2679
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:06,640
But we need at least 500 bucks.

2680
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,160
So the link is there.

2681
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:10,880
If you can.

2682
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:11,200
Great.

2683
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:12,880
If you can't, it's understandable.

2684
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:14,580
All right.

2685
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:17,920
Well, I know you're on your way out to go.

2686
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:19,440
Yeah, run around.

2687
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:19,760
All right.

2688
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:20,800
Have fun in Dead by Daylight.

2689
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:21,360
We'll see you later.

2690
02:28:22,960 --> 02:28:23,600
See you soon.

2691
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:25,600
Later taters.

2692
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:25,920
All right.

2693
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:28,400
Let's head over to Loki your final thought tonight.

2694
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,120
My final thought is I feel like I'm sprinting when it comes to content creation.

2695
02:28:36,400 --> 02:28:40,320
And I had to keep sprinting for another three months.

2696
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:42,640
Hey, we're tired.

2697
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:45,600
Celebrate the goalposts you do have.

2698
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:46,880
You have a thousand followers.

2699
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:49,280
I don't have that many on Twitch.

2700
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,160
You got you got more.

2701
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:51,600
I think you have more than Jamie too.

2702
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:53,520
So you got you got lots, lots of followers.

2703
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:54,240
Good for you.

2704
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:54,800
It's great.

2705
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:55,440
Celebrate that.

2706
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:55,940
Yeah.

2707
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:57,520
Congrats.

2708
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:58,400
You earned it.

2709
02:28:58,400 --> 02:28:59,760
You work very hard on those videos.

2710
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:03,040
And one of these days people will fucking see that.

2711
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:04,400
And it's they're seeing it.

2712
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:05,600
It's slow, but they're seeing it.

2713
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:06,240
Long hours.

2714
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:06,800
Yes.

2715
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:09,440
It's the same thing I tell YYR behind those games.

2716
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:12,240
One of these days, somebody's going to see super multitasking.

2717
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:13,360
It finally did happen.

2718
02:29:13,360 --> 02:29:15,040
It just maybe didn't catch the wildfire.

2719
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:17,680
I thought maybe being featured in a video like that would.

2720
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:20,640
But, you know, one of these days, one of these days.

2721
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:26,080
My final thought, I guess I'll also update on my personal stream stuff.

2722
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:28,480
So Monday, I think we're going to do some Theatrhythm.

2723
02:29:28,480 --> 02:29:30,720
I think I'm going to just do a marathon Theatrhythm stream

2724
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,120
and really try to play every song once and try to get through

2725
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,880
that portion of the game and get that trophy.

2726
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:38,880
And then Tuesday, I'm going to start Stranger of Paradise

2727
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:39,840
Final Fantasy Origin.

2728
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:41,680
I'll hold the box up one more time because I've done it,

2729
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:43,040
like, 70 times tonight.

2730
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:43,760
So we'll do that.

2731
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:45,520
There we go.

2732
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:47,360
Thank you, Jaskren, for asking.

2733
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:48,960
What's Loki's YouTube handle again?

2734
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:50,640
It is loki.olr on YouTube.

2735
02:29:50,640 --> 02:29:51,200
All one word.

2736
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:52,240
No underscores or dashes.

2737
02:29:52,960 --> 02:29:54,880
So and thank you for the link, Mike Deft.

2738
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:59,440
If you want to follow me on Twitch, you can here at Rob Roberts

2739
02:29:59,440 --> 02:30:01,920
and then DarkSakura will be rating in just a moment.

2740
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:04,080
So just stay tuned and we'll hop into her channel.

2741
02:30:04,880 --> 02:30:05,760
That's it.

2742
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:07,840
She's DarkSakura underscore O-L-R for the...

2743
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:08,400
I forgot.

2744
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:11,040
We also have podcast listeners who don't get to automatically

2745
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,480
rate right after the feed.

2746
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:13,760
So that's it.

2747
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,160
We're done.

2748
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,200
We're going to wrap up for the night.

2749
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:16,640
Thank you so much, everybody.

2750
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:18,320
We'll see you in seven days.

2751
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:21,040
I need a nap and then I'm going to play some video games.

2752
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:22,240
Have a good night, everybody.

2753
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:22,800
Bye-bye.

2754
02:30:52,240 --> 02:31:05,600
We're all still true.
