0	13440	My gaming PC has a 2080 Ti and I've been enjoying max graphics quality for everything
13440	14440	I play.
14440	17480	Tonight I learned that Diablo 4 will officially end this streak and now I will have to start
17480	22080	saving up for a graphics card that's going to be at least 200% more voluminous for 1%
22080	23080	better graphics.
23080	26840	Gotta get ready for that 8K ray-traced DLSS lifelock frames for a second, we live in a
26840	28040	simulation quality!
28040	31120	This is your better than real life quality update, now it's time for your hosts Rob
31120	34040	Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's
34040	35040	gaming news.
35040	40200	Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
40200	45120	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45120	47960	where every gamer has a voice.
47960	54880	It is Orange Lounge Radio, we're here once again, episode number 958 of our show for
54880	61020	tonight April the 30th of 2023 and you know what that means of course, tomorrow it's going
61020	62020	to be what?
62020	66720	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, hey how are you doing?
66720	67720	Hi.
67720	68720	Hi.
68720	69720	I'm sore.
69720	70720	You're sore?
70720	73440	Yeah, I did two hours of ballet today.
73440	74440	Oh fun.
74440	82320	I actually started my first online class and even though it was a beginner, just imagine
82320	90040	being on one foot with one lifted just to the ankle and going from demi-plié directly
90040	96400	into relevé so you're, it's like a half squat and then all the way on your tiptoes, ten
96400	99480	times in a row in one foot.
99480	105240	I hurt in places I did not know I could hurt before because ballet does not use like most
105240	109800	of the muscles you would think of in sports, it uses a lot of those little muscles.
109800	111600	But then that means it's good.
111600	112600	That's good.
112600	113600	You're working them out.
113600	117760	But being in a turnout with your feet like that, it's all rotation from the hips and
117760	122040	honestly enough, my hip doesn't hurt in the way it normally does, it's the muscles that
122040	125400	hurt so I'm feeling really good about it.
125400	129740	Ironically, tying it back to games, that's how I felt after Wii Fit you know or even
129740	132760	oh god Ring Fit, remember Ring Fit?
132760	136660	Even just kind of going through that the first few times, it's like oh I definitely need
136660	141200	to work out more because you know this is wearing me out.
141200	146380	I should try those types of games again now that I've had a better cardio routine in the
146380	151260	last couple of years than I've had in a very long, since I was in my 20s honestly.
151260	153620	So yeah.
153620	158980	I want to get Ring Fit for the yoga stuff.
158980	161540	I don't know if I'll need a balance board for any of that.
161540	164540	No, Ring Fit's independent from the balance board stuff.
165500	173100	But the thing is, is that I think our Wii is in a box somewhere, somewhere.
173100	178220	And so I might have to find something else.
178220	186740	I would love it if there was something that would use one of the sensor cameras.
186740	194020	Going back to earlier technology that was, that tried to be big, that would be good for
194020	199100	registering like your general position, like you're in a certain place, although it wouldn't
199100	204860	necessarily work with a bar I think because the bar would take up space, but just something
204860	212420	that generally would measure is your foot in the right position, are your hips in the
212420	218140	right turnout, things like that.
218140	222460	I think that would be really tremendous and I think Nintendo would be the right company
222460	228580	to do something like that with their focus on general health and wellbeing and group
228580	230820	oriented activities, I'd say.
230820	235820	I don't see them doing it through a camera, but the whole idea of like strapping joy cons
235820	239140	and using the joy cons to kind of measure positions, I could see that.
239140	243660	And actually, since you do kind of reference it, I could see, we kind of have no idea what
243660	246660	to expect from Nintendo after Zelda, right?
246660	251620	Like we really don't know, like we know Metroid Prime 4 is being worked on for something at
251620	255740	some point, but generally we don't know what Nintendo plans to release.
255740	262100	And I would think another fitness game would be like, I don't want to say like a low hanging
262100	266080	fruit, but I don't know what it's called, like an easy win for Nintendo for the holiday
266080	271580	to do some type of, even if it's not like Ring Fit Adventure 2, some type of switch
271580	275660	fitness type of thing would just seem like an easy thing for Nintendo.
275660	280340	But here I am, video games are easy to make, just push a button, I get it.
280340	285780	But I still feel like a game like that probably takes less developmental muscle than something
285780	292340	like a Zelda or a Mario even where you're designing all these levels and graphics to
292340	293600	go with them and everything else.
293600	295140	So I don't know.
295140	299980	This is where I think Peloton could get into the gaming industry.
299980	304660	They kind of, some might argue they're trying to already, yeah.
304660	307140	They're very rudimentary, but yes.
308100	313260	If they put out their bikes for how expensive they are, what if they put out like a mocap
313260	320260	suit that just has the sensors built into the suit and then you work out in the suit
320260	327460	or you have like little sensors you attach to certain parts of yourself and then you
327460	328580	would move along with it.
328580	333660	And then on top of that, they re-market it as a controller, instead of how terrible the
333660	337180	activator was, we now have the Pelotator?
337180	341740	Call me Peloton, I'm smart.
341740	346460	Not to go too far down this rabbit hole, but oops, it is an episode of OLR.
346460	352060	The thing with Peloton is that they're kind of known for being extremely pricey and now
352060	356100	they're having a hard time, now that pandemic lockdowns are easing up and people are going
356100	360180	back to their traditional gyms, they're having a hard time hanging on and I think if they
360180	365380	can lower that cost by maybe putting out like teaming up and putting a Peloton app
365380	370820	on Switch or even Xbox, PlayStation, you name it, or just general something that's on all
370820	374900	three and doing something a little more accessible, I think would be like a win for them.
374900	376340	But what do I know?
376340	378520	I'm just some person.
378520	382580	But I know Mishkins knows a thing or two in our chat saying if I had the money, I'd buy
382580	385740	a bike with the gaming screen, something along those lines.
385740	390380	Anyway, I hate to ignore, I need to say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
390380	391380	Hi, Loki.
391380	392380	Hello.
392380	393380	How are you doing?
393380	394380	I'm doing fine.
394380	396900	What do you think of all these exercise games?
396900	400740	Now I joke that you wouldn't play any of these exercise games, but it's actually, you have
400740	405900	one in your garage that you're also not playing, but it's not like we all didn't meet playing
405900	410780	a video game, Dance Dance Revolution, for those who don't know, that led to a lot of
410780	411780	exercise, right?
411780	412780	Yeah, that's for sure.
412820	413820	I mean, I don't know.
413820	417180	I just don't think they're going to release one because I don't think it's going to sell
417180	424860	well, probably because I don't think, you know, anything beyond like Wii Sports hasn't
424860	426700	sold as well as Wii Sports.
426700	434100	So like even Switch Sports Resort or whatever it's called now, not the system seller like
434100	438020	Wii Sports was, you know, so I don't think they would do it again.
438020	442300	There's something to be said about when Nintendo was parading around their new consoles around
442340	447260	the circuit and when it was the Wii, they would show Wii Tennis, Wii Bowling right then
447260	451020	and there as this is what the console can do.
451020	455420	With the Switch, it was Zelda Breath of the Wild was the big game they were showing.
455420	459740	Maybe a little, I would say maybe 10% 1-2 Switch and those little tech demo games and
459740	463580	90% Zelda Breath of the Wild and that whole thing.
463580	465780	And that's what people associate with the Switch.
465780	470260	So when you put out the sports game kind of like after the fact, I think it was just harder.
470260	475180	I would bet, I would bet the average gamer doesn't even know that game exists.
475180	478340	I would bet the average gamer that bought Wii Sports has no idea.
478340	480980	Switch, did you know Switch did a sequel to Wii Sports?
482540	486660	Yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it, that's Nintendo's problem.
487540	493940	So they need to take that shit on The View or just more, not that I'm saying Jamie watches
493940	499620	The View, but other places that, you know, are a little more to hit at the mainstream
499620	501380	folks and, you know, these things.
501380	503460	I don't know why that was the thing that came to mind.
503460	505460	It just was.
505460	510020	On the subject of the Peloton stuff, I always thought it was funny that like in our local
510020	514740	mall here in Roseville, they have a, how do you know what you call it?
514740	516500	Like, I don't think it's a Peloton store.
516500	520500	It's like a, I call it a cage because that's what it is.
520500	526100	It's a Peloton cage that's in the middle of the mall that you can buy a membership
526100	531540	to to go use the machines in the middle of the mall, like exposed to everybody.
532100	533860	I literally thought that was a showroom.
533860	535460	I thought they were selling the bikes there.
535460	536100	I didn't know that was.
536100	541060	No, I think that you buy membership to that because I remember reading, like, I was like,
541060	542260	I walked in there to look at it.
542260	543940	I'm like, oh, those look expensive.
543940	545620	And then I saw the thing about membership.
545620	547300	Like, who the hell do that?
547300	548980	Like, why would you buy a membership to that?
548980	552260	There's a lot of people who put themselves on display while working out.
553060	557620	I've seen gyms at malls before, but usually they're in the anchor store position.
557620	562180	And I know what's weird about that one is the Peloton is like between, you know, you
562180	567140	know how a mall is like your, your JC Penny on one side and your, I don't know, Sears
567140	569940	or what's in a mall, Nordstrom on the other side or something.
569940	572180	And then between them are all the other stores, right?
572180	573540	That's Peloton is in between.
573540	574100	So I get it.
574100	578100	Like, usually if there's a Crunch Fitness or something, it's, it's on, it's in one
578100	579540	of those anchor spaces.
579540	582580	So it's interesting to be a partnership in advertising.
583140	587380	You know, you have the product out there with real people using it in the middle of the
587380	592260	store and it sparks interest in, in buying when people see, oh, that's how it works.
592260	594100	I see these people, you do the thing.
594100	596420	Why, why don't I have something like that at home?
596420	599060	So I don't have to embarrass myself in the middle of the mall.
599060	600740	I legit thought it was a showroom.
600740	602820	I didn't even realize people actually went in there to work out.
604900	609460	I mean, I thought it was at first, but then, but they know it's, it's.
610180	614740	I guess it's both, but there's also the population paid to advertise.
614740	617540	Have you seen now that car dealerships are in malls?
617540	623060	That's weird to me because you can only fit one or two cars in there, but it's things
623060	624900	like Tesla.
624900	626740	And I've seen another one too.
626740	631700	There, there are places that are, um, like you, you see the one car and then come over
631700	635780	here to this tablet to build your own car, to your own specifications type of thing.
636900	637540	Yeah, weird.
637540	638740	Yeah, it is a little wild.
638740	641540	Tiger claw and chat says malls are a dying breed.
641540	644020	You wouldn't know it from that one in Roseville.
644020	645380	That you just referenced.
645380	648420	And you would know for the one, you would know for the one.
649940	654900	Actually, I, I went to, to Arden fair, um, the week of my birthday.
654900	659220	Cause I had to go get my, my free gift at Sephora and use my Sephora gift card.
659220	659780	Don't judge me.
660420	665060	Um, and, uh, it was pretty busy there too.
665060	670500	Actually it was, and I got to see like the, well, one of my stores is gone.
670500	675620	I'm very sad, but, uh, there were a lot of like different stores as they're in some more
675620	676420	higher end stuff.
676420	678420	Like I think the Armani store is still there.
678420	679380	There's a coach store.
680260	684820	There's the, the, the Sears is of course, um, I think closed up.
684820	685620	Yeah, it's gone.
686580	690420	Yeah, but you know, it's still, it's still kind of lively there.
690420	692180	You know, it is showing up more and more at malls.
692180	692580	I swear.
692580	694260	I feel like I'm repeating myself from two weeks ago.
694260	695060	So stop me if I am.
695060	701460	But, but it's, it's all the like, um, import Japanese plushie, anime stuff.
701460	704820	Like I swear I see like three of those stores in every mall now.
704820	708740	And, but not, and even, even more like Miniso, which is a great store.
708740	711380	I love that place, but it's, it's a lot of that stuff showing up.
711380	714180	I didn't see a Miniso there, but I didn't look.
714180	715540	I almost stayed on the bottom floor.
715540	716100	It's upstairs.
716100	716820	That's why you missed it.
716820	718260	It's upstairs by the carousel.
718260	721060	I was almost at where the carousel used to be, but I think it actually is still there.
721060	722180	I just, out of sight.
722420	724420	I'm sad that Morphe is gone.
724420	726260	Cause that's where I get my eyeliner.
726260	726760	Hello.
728420	732660	But, um, the, the, the candy store is still there.
732660	736180	I remember when that mall had a TV studio inside the mall.
736180	740820	Remember that they used to do the new news on channel three at the mall and they tried
740820	744740	to do like, they tried to do a today show thing where you could stand behind the wall
744740	747220	and, you know, try to be like, that was, that was the one.
747220	748660	And now it's like a Verizon store.
748660	752820	Like it's not even anything like what it was before my time.
752820	753220	Oh yeah.
753220	758820	No, I thought it was only about 10, 15 years ago that that was there, but I could be, I
758820	759380	don't know.
759380	763620	Anyway, malls, malls, good times.
763620	764100	All right.
764100	767380	Anyway, uh, let's get into the actual, where are the arcades?
768500	769140	Well, yeah.
769140	773380	Round one, new mall anchor store that seems to be, and you know what we were talking about
773380	776020	our malls dying or aren't they, aren't they dying?
776020	778180	It all depends on those anchor stores.
778180	778740	That is it.
778740	783140	Like, it seems to me like the malls live and die by those anchor stores and the things
783140	783620	that are in it.
783620	788900	And that's why like sunrise mall is that like surprised me about sunrise because they had
788900	789540	a Macy's.
789540	793060	Well, the best thing about, they have the split Macy's.
793060	794180	They're actually, you know what?
794180	797540	Those Macy's are actually better than any other one in the area because they're still
797540	798340	split.
798340	803460	So there's a larger selection there than there is in any other one in Alabama.
803460	806660	We didn't have Macy's in my town.
806660	808980	It's just real estate is expensive.
808980	810100	Yeah, no, it's true.
810100	810660	Yeah.
810660	813460	Dillard's and Parisian and gaffers.
813460	815940	A lot, a lot of them just started eating each other up.
817060	821460	So, cause my mom's favorite store was wine stocks and I think, I think Macy's bought
821460	822260	them at some point.
822980	825460	You know what store I miss Rob before we move on?
825460	825940	What?
825940	827700	I missed, uh, Woolworth's.
828900	829700	Oh yeah.
829700	833460	Those used to, well, there's, there's still a thing overseas.
833540	835780	There's still a thing overseas, but we, they're there.
835780	839140	I don't think they're even close to the same thing that they used to be.
839140	840900	No, they're not the, they're not the same thing.
840900	844580	But like, I remember for a long time, our Woolworth's had like a soda counter.
845300	849700	And, um, I, the thing I remember most about them is that they had the clothing racks that
849700	851220	were big and circular.
851220	853700	And when I was like six, I would just go hide in there.
855300	858980	And my mom would be like, Jamie, I know you're in one of these things.
858980	860500	You better come out by the count of three.
862020	862980	I'd come out by two.
863940	866900	Uh, Mike Defton chat says we have Woolworth's in Mexico.
866900	867940	They're different though.
867940	870820	It's one of those things where like somebody took the name and modernized it.
870820	872420	It's not, it's not what it used to be.
872420	874020	So, but anyway, all right.
874020	878340	I was going to say, even though they're tearing down sunrise mall, they're going to be keeping
878340	883460	the anchor stores anyways, and then converting like parking lot space in the condos or apartments
883460	883780	or something.
883780	884180	Yeah.
884180	887460	They're keeping one of the Macy's, I think, and the JC Penney's.
887460	890340	But yeah, like half the, like, remember the old cinemas?
890900	893860	If you walk down that side of the mall, it is all gone.
893860	895940	Like it is all just empty.
895940	896980	So it's like closed off.
897780	898420	Oh, is it now?
899220	899700	Oh yeah.
899700	900900	They have the whole side gate.
902100	903220	It wasn't last time I was there.
903220	905140	The movies there was with Monet.
905860	906740	Oh, that was a long time.
906740	907540	Oh boy.
907540	912100	We, we went to play a Pikmin at the mall and we walked around and it was, we were laughing
912100	916900	our asses off walking down the one side going, wow, there's literally nothing here.
916900	921700	But we, we just sprouted two, uh, big flowers or whatever they are in that game.
921700	922260	Anyway.
922260	922420	All right.
922420	924020	We got to get into other gaming news.
924020	925860	Let's get into the kickoff topic for tonight.
928260	930660	Sometimes, sometimes our age creeps through a little bit.
930660	932900	Oh, but I haven't said, of course we do tape live.
932900	935460	If you want to dive down in nostalgia rabbit hole with us, you sure can.
935460	939540	Every Sunday night, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of geeks
939540	945780	network, twitch.tv slash V O G network, where we type tape, type, type, type live typing
945780	951860	of the dead type live right after the Bobby black Wolf show, except he's not here next
951860	953060	week, but that's okay.
953060	954980	We're still going to do our thing next week.
954980	960820	Um, Loki real quick, since we are taping live on Twitch, I meant to ask this video playing
960820	961460	behind you tonight.
961460	963940	Is that a tiny Tina Wonderland?
964500	965060	Yes, it is.
965060	965540	Aha.
965540	966180	I got it.
966180	966820	I got one.
967380	967700	All right.
968100	968500	Nice.
968500	974260	All right, let's get into, um, our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do a, well, this
974260	979140	is like a current thing going on, but I wanted to kind of ask about why is this so important,
979140	979860	but let's get into it.
979860	985380	Loki, what do we want to start talking off talking with horizon, uh, forbidden West had
985380	986580	some DLC come out.
986580	990900	Bernie shore is not that long ago and, um, it was good.
990900	992260	You know, the DLC was good.
992820	996660	Um, you might not know it if you look at Metacritic and some of the user scores.
997060	1007300	The contention comes that there is a scene which alloy, um, kisses a woman names, uh,
1007300	1008260	sake Saka.
1009060	1016660	And so people like, Oh no, well, the gay I'm gonna, you know, I, I don't like it and I'm
1016660	1024420	going to review bomb it because I am homophobic and it's stupid, but that's, what's happening
1024500	1027780	is people are using it to wait, wait, wait.
1027780	1030660	I, I, this is a series a hundred percent serious question.
1030660	1032020	What kind of kiss is it?
1032020	1037460	Like, is it, is it a long kiss where a little, uh, like, is it that or is it just like a
1037460	1037620	pet?
1037620	1042980	Because I believe it is a fairly cultural norm, especially depending on what part of
1042980	1047460	the country you are for women to potentially like Peck each other is not like a big deal,
1047460	1053060	like at all, like, so is it a Peck kiss or is it a loving kiss?
1053060	1056820	Uh, I don't know.
1056820	1059540	I'm skipping through the video to figure that out.
1059540	1059860	Okay.
1059860	1066100	Maybe somebody in the chat does not appear to be like, I don't think it's any like long
1068420	1068820	kiss.
1068820	1069220	I don't know.
1070340	1070980	I know.
1070980	1071620	I know.
1071620	1076660	I know it's a weird question to ask, but it is a long romantic kiss, but it's not even
1076660	1077140	that long.
1077780	1082660	It's like, uh, like a minor, like it is a romantic kiss, but it's not like, uh, you
1082660	1085300	know, yeah, it's a romantic kiss, I guess.
1085300	1085620	Okay.
1085620	1086180	Okay.
1086180	1087300	Why should people care?
1087300	1087860	Yeah, no.
1087860	1092020	And I, I was going to get to that is like, it really shouldn't matter, but I was more
1092020	1096900	going to go down the rabbit hole of like, wow, these snowflakes are really sensitive
1096900	1099620	if it was going to be just like a little bit of a pack, you know?
1099620	1101460	So, uh, but you're right.
1101460	1103460	It shouldn't, it shouldn't matter what the type of kiss is.
1104420	1106580	People are pushing the gay agenda on them.
1106580	1108180	Like, Oh my God, people.
1108180	1109540	Like, it's just ridiculous.
1113540	1113860	Right.
1113860	1117940	But I think that they didn't know because there wasn't like a warning on the DLC or
1117940	1118180	something.
1118180	1120500	Like you shouldn't need a warning.
1120500	1124500	It's not, I understand that you're preaching to the choir.
1124500	1126580	We're standing here behind you going, amen, amen.
1126580	1127940	It's it's, you know?
1127940	1128660	Yeah.
1128660	1129620	It's just dumb.
1129620	1130180	So yeah.
1130180	1136820	So they're, they are review bombing it saying that, you know, uh, homosexuals are putting
1136820	1140740	a dirty agenda and sabotage what could have been a beautiful story.
1141620	1142420	Blah, blah, blah.
1143380	1148340	Guerrilla games, retcon the main character for LG LGBTQ nonsense.
1148900	1150740	Um, you know, that kind of stuff.
1150740	1151700	It's just dumb.
1152580	1152900	What?
1152900	1156420	So what is the homosexual agenda?
1156420	1159540	Like I, I've never, I thought it was just going to brunch on Sunday.
1159540	1159780	I know.
1159860	1163460	I don't expect anyone here to actually be able to answer that, but it's that, it's that
1163460	1164740	whole thing of like, wait a minute.
1164740	1169220	When you say they're pushing the homosexual agenda, literally, what is that?
1169220	1172580	Because I can stay as a long time homosexual.
1173620	1177300	My agenda is like, did we get the cats enough food?
1178020	1180180	Are brunch plans still on for Sunday?
1180980	1182500	Did I leave the gas on?
1183300	1188180	It's the straight men's fear that gay men are going to look at them the way they look
1188180	1188980	at women.
1188980	1190820	No, I don't think it's even that necessarily.
1191460	1197300	Maybe partly that, but what it is is that they feel that being gay is a choice.
1197300	1199140	It is not the way you're born.
1199140	1200820	It is just a choice.
1200820	1207380	And that because it's a choice, that it is that this influence and normalization of this
1207380	1212100	stuff is going to turn straight people gay, like their children gay.
1212100	1217540	That's why that they're afraid of the whole like trans like education and stuff like that
1217540	1222340	and gender affirming care is because they feel that people talking about stuff is going
1222340	1226740	to open their kids eyes into changing genders or something like that.
1226740	1227780	It's stupid.
1227780	1232020	It's because they're afraid they're going to be, they're going to learn how wrong they
1232020	1232500	were.
1232500	1236980	It's because the big bad men on TV tell them that they should be afraid of this.
1236980	1241220	And that's why those people have, you know, billion dollar lawsuits and get fired from
1241220	1241940	their stations.
1241940	1243140	So whatever.
1243140	1244660	No, I, I get it.
1244660	1248420	Cause I've heard that before the whole, like, Oh, they're trying to convert kids.
1248420	1255380	And it's like, I, I have, what, in what universe does that make sense?
1255380	1258660	Why, why do I want to sit here and recruit?
1258660	1264020	Like I, for a multitude of reasons, that is just like wrong.
1264020	1268980	Like it's being gay with pedophilia, which I can't stand that.
1268980	1274420	Oh, you want to set me off and you want me to go zero to bitch in five seconds, do that
1274420	1274900	equation.
1274900	1275780	Cause that pisses me off.
1275780	1276420	Sorry, Jamie.
1276420	1283700	People are, people are using the, the larger numbers of, I guess, known LGBTQ plus people
1283700	1287620	in the world to, to support their stupid theory.
1287620	1291540	When all it is is that people are less afraid and are more public.
1294580	1300500	And, and they, they want, there's, there's a certain mindset that goes in a group that
1300500	1302100	is the majority.
1302100	1303140	And this is psychology.
1303140	1304420	Now this is psychology.
1305380	1311700	They start seeing themselves becoming outnumbered and fear they're becoming the minority and
1311700	1313620	that they're going to lose their social power.
1314340	1322180	And so the people with the, I would say most amount of influence in that particular circle
1322180	1328420	are going to try to spread whatever information that they need to, to keep more of the quote
1328420	1332980	majority on their side, to keep perpetrating the way things are.
1332980	1336900	They want the status quo thing is status quo already changed and they just didn't.
1336900	1338180	And they just are now noticing.
1338820	1339380	Yeah.
1339380	1339700	All right.
1339700	1342900	Anyway, I feel like we could, we're appreciative of the choir.
1342900	1347060	I feel like if you've gotten this far in the podcast, you, you know how we feel on this
1347060	1347540	topic.
1347540	1350660	And if you disagree, I don't know what to tell you at this point.
1350660	1355460	So that all being said, there's a kind of another part to this that Metacritic now is
1355460	1356660	having to respond to, right?
1357380	1361540	They've responded to says Metacritic is aware of the abusive and disrespectful reviews of
1361540	1363780	Horizon Forbidden West burning chores.
1363780	1368340	We have a moderation system in place to track violations of our terms of service.
1368340	1372900	Our teams review each and every report of abuse, including, but not limited to racist,
1372900	1376340	sexist, homophobic insults to other users, et cetera.
1377140	1379380	If violations occur, the reviews are removed.
1379380	1384420	We are currently evolving our process and tools to introduce stricter moderation in the
1384420	1385620	coming months.
1385620	1387460	So yeah, it sucks that they're doing this.
1387460	1392180	I mean, honestly, people should be complaining about other games like Star Wars for, you
1392180	1394420	know, quality issues, not necessarily.
1394420	1403780	You may remember not even that long ago, people were upset that alloy had facial hair because
1403780	1408100	she's a human woman, allegedly human, human looking.
1409060	1410500	And and guess what?
1410500	1412020	Women have hair on their face.
1412900	1414580	Oh my God, it's a shock.
1414580	1417620	Like these are there are women who have full beards.
1418900	1420580	It's just it's it's ridiculous.
1421380	1423940	Yeah, that's actually a medical condition, though.
1424580	1426580	It's yeah.
1426580	1428660	So let me ask this question.
1430180	1434260	Here's here's here's where I find myself when I see a story about these types of review
1434260	1434660	bombings.
1434660	1438500	And I don't I don't want to, like, belittle the situation or anything, because I understand
1438500	1441060	like this is messed up with these review bombers are doing.
1441060	1446580	And I am glad that Metacritic is taking steps to address and try to weed out some of this,
1446580	1449940	you know, systematic bullshit that seems to come up every time.
1449940	1451380	But it leads me back to this point.
1452260	1456660	Why do why do Metacritic user reviews fucking matter in the first place?
1456660	1461300	I have never in my life let that website or any like it.
1461300	1463140	This isn't me picking on Metacritic.
1463140	1468980	It's me picking on these type of, you know, hive mind user review site, reading the comment
1468980	1470340	type of places.
1470340	1474180	I have never let those influence my decision.
1474180	1480420	Now I'm going to quantify that and say, I will listen to user reviews from trusted friends
1480420	1485940	on social media, on, you know, Twitter when I'm feeling okay about Twitter or Facebook
1485940	1490020	or Instagram or whatever, you know, I guess blue sky.
1490020	1491700	Now I can throw in the conversation or any of that stuff.
1491700	1496420	I trust I trust users that I know.
1496980	1500900	And I've, I've had like a friendship with or Twitch streamers is actually, well, if
1500900	1506100	we're going to talk about video games, I absolutely make informed decisions from Twitch streamers.
1506100	1510740	I like, and even random, like if I'm on the fence about a game, like, Oh, am I finally
1510740	1514500	going to suck it up and buy stranger paradise, finally found fantasy origin.
1514500	1519700	It's because I'm watching other streamers play it and decide, or, you know, one of my
1519700	1522180	closest friends is in my ear going, it's $20.
1522180	1522820	Rob is $20.
1522820	1526020	Rob, you said you buy it was $20 and I'll let you all guess who it is.
1526020	1526660	It's $20.
1526660	1527220	It's $20.
1527220	1527540	Go get it.
1527540	1527940	Go get it.
1527940	1528500	It's $20.
1529380	1531460	And then finally I buy the game based on those.
1531460	1533860	Does it squish and end with aim?
1533860	1534420	Yes.
1534420	1538580	Because he has a pain in my ear all of the time.
1539220	1540020	He's a pusher.
1541140	1541460	Yes.
1542660	1548820	But anyway, um, my point still stands since when, and let me ask this question.
1548820	1550180	I opened this to chat.
1550180	1551780	I opened the, Oh, Shane's ears are burning.
1551780	1552820	I opened this to chat.
1552820	1554820	I opened this to anybody.
1554820	1559060	Actually, I opened this up specifically to Shane and invite him to answer this question.
1560580	1567620	Do Metacritic or, uh, sites like it, do these reviews scores matter to you?
1570740	1576180	I would say it, they don't necessarily like the user reviews don't matter too much to
1576180	1576500	me.
1576500	1580020	Like sometimes it's good to get like here, like what users think about that.
1580020	1584100	It's more useful, I think for aggregating, like actual reviews for something.
1584100	1586980	So it makes it a little bit faster to like find that kind of stuff.
1586980	1591300	But yeah, user reviews are pretty much trash because it's either gonna be a 10 or a zero.
1591300	1594100	And it, it really doesn't matter what it is.
1595620	1597380	Pro reviews don't matter to me either.
1597380	1602980	I mean, we grew up in the age of, you know, uh, Cisco and Ebert and they've been so wrong.
1602980	1603480	Yeah.
1605060	1610500	I want to look to the people who I know who have similar, um, taste to me, what they say.
1610500	1610820	Yeah.
1610820	1613060	That's gonna weigh most of all.
1613300	1618500	I can't say I never look at pro reviews because maybe if I'm kind of on the fence, I'll kind
1618500	1624660	of go, all right, what's kind of like the general consensus from professionals, but
1624660	1628420	I never go to what's the general consensus from the peanut gallery.
1629060	1637060	I'll look for, uh, articles of criticism from people that I know are very even with their
1637060	1638020	criticism.
1638020	1641940	Cause you know, another one of my little catch phrases is be critical of what you love.
1643300	1650180	And I like when people say, start off, I am a fan of this game, but here are the problems
1650180	1652180	or here's what could be better.
1652740	1659620	And I feel very, I like when someone who loves what they're doing, like for example, I love
1659620	1662260	Xanadu, but it's not a great movie.
1662260	1666580	And I can tell you why, you know, but I still love it.
1666580	1666980	Yeah.
1666980	1670260	You know, that, that my criticism is coming from a place of love.
1670260	1670660	Absolutely.
1670740	1673860	There's plenty of movies like that where I can go, I absolutely understand why people
1673860	1675460	hate this movie, but you know what?
1675460	1676740	This is my moment.
1676740	1678340	This is my, this is my thing.
1678340	1678900	I get it.
1678900	1679300	I get it.
1679940	1682180	Looking at chat, you got a lot of comments in chat.
1682180	1686740	Pod Culture says, I look more at what you guys have to say TBH.
1686740	1689060	Well, that's very, that's very kind and very flattering.
1689060	1690900	And we appreciate that platform.
1690900	1692580	You know, it's a tiny platform.
1692580	1697460	It's one little two by four piece of plywood that we get to stand on here at OLR.
1697460	1699460	But we appreciate those of you that do.
1699460	1704340	But I would file us in that same bucket of Twitch streamers and, you know, like your,
1704340	1710020	your friends basically on these types of platforms that, you know, get you to see games you might
1710020	1711220	not have seen otherwise.
1711220	1714100	I'm fond of the phrase that opinions are like assholes.
1714100	1716100	They should only come out when people want to see them.
1718580	1723860	Ooh, this is, this is something where we should clip this because Shane says, I shockingly
1723860	1725300	think Rob hit it on the head.
1725300	1729380	Well, time, time stamp date that one, quote it, put it on the back of the box.
1730100	1735780	Friends and Twitch are what helped me decide, or I'll go in blind because of previews or
1735780	1737060	my own opinions.
1737060	1739460	So, but yeah, Rob, you're welcome.
1739460	1739860	Thank you.
1739860	1740260	Thank you.
1740260	1740580	Could you?
1740580	1740820	Yes.
1740820	1742740	I'd like to actually post that on social media later.
1743540	1750660	Let's see, fifth dream in chat says I'm likely to check out a free to play MMO.
1750660	1755460	A streamer I like is playing because there's no risk, but I generally know what I will
1755460	1755620	like.
1755620	1759940	That's also a very good point about like free to play when the, when the cost is free, like
1759940	1764580	actually nothing will win me over more than a really good demo.
1764580	1769940	So as much as I'm joking about Shane and the $20 tag on this stranger paradise PlayStation
1769940	1774500	four that I keep holding up, by the way, it's PlayStation four because it has free upgrade
1774500	1776340	to PS five and PS five was sold out.
1776660	1782980	Um, but, uh, my point is it actually was the demo for this game that made me pay attention
1782980	1783940	and go, huh?
1783940	1786260	I liked that a lot more than I thought I would.
1786260	1791620	And on the flip side, there's been a meme here at VOG network on our little two by four
1791620	1792740	piece of plywood platform.
1792740	1797380	We've had, there's been a meme here about the game Nino Cooney that dates back what
1797380	1798980	like fucking like 13 years.
1798980	1799780	How old is that game?
1799780	1801460	It could probably be a classic game of the week at this point.
1801460	1802820	It's at least 10 years old at this point.
1803620	1809700	That game had a terrible demo because it didn't set things up and really explain what you
1809700	1811700	were trying to do correctly.
1811700	1815060	And it left a bad taste in your mouth because it was really hard to kind of get through
1815060	1815780	the demo.
1815780	1820100	And so it made people actively not want to buy that game.
1821700	1828420	So anyway, a demo is, I think the demos even more than anything else, I've said the biggest
1828500	1833700	thing that will influence my opinion, because it kind of goes back to what Fifth Dream had
1833700	1834420	said earlier.
1834420	1839860	It's basically a free opportunity to look at it, you know, a free opportunity to test
1839860	1840740	it out or what have you.
1841940	1851060	So if we're all sitting here going, we don't care what these folks in the peanut gallery
1851060	1856020	have to say, then why are company, why do companies seem to care?
1859300	1861860	They don't know how to think for themselves.
1861860	1866100	I mean, the people who are gathering the data are corporate level.
1866100	1868740	They're not the people that are actually playing the games.
1868740	1871620	All they care about is what a number is.
1871620	1878420	And if they see, oh, X number of consumers say this, that's all they're looking at.
1878420	1880980	They're not looking at the content of it.
1880980	1888500	You know, I'm very lucky that the company that I work for has a really good feedback
1888500	1891540	page with very specific things that they ask for.
1891540	1892100	What's wrong?
1892100	1892820	What's your ideas?
1892820	1893620	What's this?
1893620	1897220	And I think that video game companies would benefit from something like that, where people
1897220	1900180	can actually leave structured feedback with a form.
1902100	1903700	Why do you feel this way?
1903700	1905300	What is the issue with this?
1905300	1908980	On what ranking would you give this aspect of the game?
1908980	1909220	Right.
1909220	1912740	Instead of just a 200 character tweet where people say whatever they want, which isn't
1912740	1913860	always glamorous.
1913860	1914900	Yeah, I get it.
1914900	1915540	I get it.
1915540	1915860	Exactly.
1915860	1920980	But they forget exactly what, you know, the.
1923620	1924900	What's the word I'm thinking of?
1924900	1925540	What?
1925540	1932180	How the population acts, because I'm sorry, people will flock.
1932740	1937380	It's a natural thing that no one wants to be publicly wrong.
1937380	1942340	It takes, I think, a strong individual to be able to offer a differing opinion and back
1942340	1942900	it up.
1942900	1947060	Yeah, but so the majority of people, they don't want to be that that nail that gets
1947060	1947620	hammered down.
1947620	1950020	They want to go with the crowd and be cool.
1950660	1953300	So you're not always getting an honest opinion out there.
1953300	1954420	You're getting a bandwagon.
1955300	1959380	Bobby Blackwolf with some receipts and chat, by the way, stating that Nino Cooney was released
1959380	1961700	in America in January 2013.
1961700	1965060	So it just recently became eligible as a classic game by those standards.
1965060	1968820	But Bobby does go on to point out that was just like the first US game.
1969460	1973940	There were some Japan only titles in the first Nino Cooney game ever came out in 2010.
1973940	1977140	So if it felt like the series is a little older, that might be why.
1978580	1984820	So, yeah, you know, on the whole subject of, you know, user reviews, I think back to a
1984820	1987780	company we talked a lot about last week, and that's Niantic.
1987780	1992020	And I'm not going to retread that whole ground tonight, but I do remember with a game of
1992020	1994180	theirs, I've played a lot more Ingress.
1994180	1998180	When they went from some of you may or may not know this, they actually released a whole
1998180	1999780	new client for Ingress.
1999780	2004660	So imagine they took like Pokemon Go and release like a complete new version of it that just
2004660	2005860	ran on the same back end.
2005860	2008340	That's what they did with Ingress at one point.
2008340	2013380	So there was what they called Ingress scanner redacted or basically original vanilla Ingress.
2013380	2015140	And then they released Ingress Prime.
2015940	2020260	And then at some point they turned off the original Ingress client because they wanted
2020260	2021780	people to move to Prime.
2021860	2026820	And this is when it started getting review bombed like crazy because change is scary.
2026820	2031140	People liked what they liked in the original scanner and the new scanner could sometimes
2031140	2032900	be a little bit more of a resource hog.
2032900	2035460	It wasn't optimized as good at this point.
2035460	2039140	You know, it was, I think there was one or two features it was still kind of missing
2039140	2041700	and didn't have true parity with the original client with.
2041700	2043300	So it got review bombed to hell.
2044180	2049220	And I remember the company seemed to actually kind of take it personally in a way.
2049220	2054020	A year later when they fixed a lot of issues and started rolling new things out and kind
2054020	2056100	of saying like, here's why Ingress Prime.
2056100	2061780	I remember Niantic posting in some of their like Ingress channels, hey, if you feel different
2061780	2067060	about Prime now than you did a year ago, could you go back and update your reviews in Google
2067060	2068180	Play Store and iTunes?
2068180	2070580	Like this was legit an ass that the company had.
2070580	2073460	Can you go update your reviews if you don't hate us anymore?
2074420	2080420	So it just, it was, and it struck me as odd because I was like, damn, the user reviews
2080420	2081860	matter that much.
2082580	2087060	But I suppose, and I don't know, I don't want to go too far down this.
2087060	2093940	I suppose when we talk about an app store, perhaps that could influence the display on
2093940	2095940	searches and rankings and things like that.
2095940	2098500	Perhaps that is a factor I'm not thinking about.
2099060	2106260	Um, but it just strikes me as a weird ask because yeah, user reviews should matter,
2106260	2106980	right?
2106980	2107540	It's weird.
2109140	2112420	Anyway, anything else you want to say on this?
2115220	2115700	Anyone?
2115700	2120020	No, I don't know if there's many companies outside of like the app stuff.
2120020	2127140	Like I can't imagine that companies are still using Metacritic as like a metric for bonuses
2127140	2127620	and stuff.
2127620	2129140	Oh yeah, I've heard that.
2129140	2136260	Considering like how, you know, uh, Star Wars, how, you know, it seems that the companies
2136260	2142500	are very comfortable with them shipping games that are not in working condition when they
2142500	2143460	get shipped out.
2144980	2149300	Yeah, I was gonna say the incentive should be tied around bug reports, although to be
2149300	2151780	fair before somebody corrects me on it, yes, I get it.
2151780	2156580	Like oftentimes it's the publisher's fault, not the developer that the game releases with
2156580	2158500	bugs in it because there's aggressive time deal, right?
2158500	2165220	So I do understand, but yeah, to Loki's point, I do wish the incentives were more tied around
2165220	2170420	that type of quality than just, you know, are the, you know, professional reviewers
2170420	2172260	going to get it or not what you're doing.
2174180	2178260	Even though I don't think this game, again, holding this up because I've done it four
2178260	2183300	times now, I don't think this game was particularly strongly reviewed, but the people that seemed
2183460	2186340	I mean, maybe like 75 or 80, which isn't bad.
2186340	2189540	It just is in that weird realm of like, it's all right.
2189540	2192820	But like the people that I know that have like really played and spent time with this
2192820	2194420	game really seem to love it.
2194420	2196180	So it's just, it's interesting.
2196180	2199220	But I think a lot of Team Ninja games kind of go that way.
2199220	2203220	Like, yeah, even think about Metroid Other M, Metroid Other M probably landed in that
2203220	2205460	same sort of nebulous, it's all right kind of category.
2205460	2207780	But the people that liked that game really liked that game.
2208500	2212420	The people that hate that game really hate that game, but it's, it's kind of interesting.
2214260	2219300	Deft in Chat says sucks that the same didn't happen with Pokemon Go Niantic asking the
2219300	2220740	community for something.
2220740	2227620	Well, if the track record says anything to me, then I would say if you want Niantic to
2227620	2234020	hashtag hear us Niantic actively, one of the easiest things you could do to get noticed
2234020	2240260	is start review bombing it on these stores, which is wild that I'm sitting here saying
2240260	2245380	that on one hand, and on the other hand, going these reviews shouldn't matter.
2245380	2250420	But I just told you a story where it clearly did to the publisher review bombing it for
2250420	2255300	like, and this is this is this one specific circumstances function, not like because,
2255300	2258020	oh, I'm a racist, or I'm homophobic.
2258020	2261460	And I Oh, yeah, super, super different.
2261460	2264820	Like Mike, my faith tells me that this is wrong.
2264820	2268500	And so therefore, you're wrong for putting it in my game.
2269300	2274020	My, my, my one star review would say Niantic made a promise to the player base that they
2274020	2275060	did not follow through on.
2275780	2276340	Yeah, that's it.
2276340	2280340	That would be that would be the extent of my one star review on Pokemon Go.
2280340	2281780	I don't need to write a novel.
2281780	2284820	I don't need I'm just gonna keep it short and sweet Niantic did not follow through on
2284820	2286180	a promise they made to their player base.
2288260	2294740	So anyway, that all being said, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of things
2294820	2298900	that have brought us joy the five stars of our gaming week.
2298900	2299940	Let's go to Dark Sakura.
2299940	2300820	How was your gaming week?
2301860	2302980	It was pretty good.
2302980	2305700	I beat Marvel's Midnight Suns last night.
2305700	2309060	And well, apparently people want to see me play that.
2309060	2312580	So retro night is under construction.
2313700	2319380	And I'm going to be doing another playthrough of Midnight Suns on my Saturday streaming.
2320100	2322740	When you say another playthrough, are you doing anything to change it?
2322740	2324020	I don't know that game very well.
2325140	2325780	New Game Plus.
2325780	2326260	Okay.
2326260	2329780	No, I haven't really noticed like major differences yet, except I've got like,
2330820	2334660	all the cosmetics are unlocked for me to buy that I had earned before,
2334660	2335780	but I have to buy them again.
2335780	2338260	I started with a bunch of gloss, which is the money.
2339540	2344260	So and I can go ahead and invest stuff in characters I don't have yet.
2346100	2354420	So and actually, what was weird is that like, for example, when you want Morbius in,
2354420	2357780	you know, he's a DLC, you have to go do his mission to recruit him.
2358740	2360500	He was just hanging out there.
2360500	2362340	Like, dude, why are you?
2362340	2364020	I'm the brand new hunter.
2364020	2365540	Why are you in my house?
2367140	2368420	And why are you kind of hot?
2370100	2374020	Anyway, I play Beatles pinball.
2375780	2378180	We're actually selling Medieval Madness.
2378180	2378680	Oh, wow.
2379700	2380740	To pay for Weird Al.
2382340	2382660	Fair.
2382660	2385060	And so we'll have it for about another month.
2385060	2386500	It's the time to play it.
2388420	2389780	I'm playing my wordscapes.
2389780	2391140	Definitely playing Dead by Daylight.
2393380	2398180	I got three more adepts last week on Killer.
2402340	2403700	I got Legion, finally.
2405540	2411540	I got Myers, who I very much suck at, but I figured a strategy.
2412180	2419060	Do RPD with the hair tuft, the iridescent one that keeps you in tier three.
2420100	2421620	And just walk around stabbing people.
2421620	2422340	That's really it.
2424500	2429780	And I got Hag, even with the changes to her mechanics.
2431060	2435060	So I'm getting a little bit further on finishing out my adepts.
2435060	2439780	I still haven't played, like, Wesker or the Knight or our Skull Merchant.
2440100	2442500	So maybe I'll have to do that.
2442500	2443860	I'm just kind of reluctant.
2445620	2453460	And a game that I ordered has arrived, Osmond, which I've done as a classic game of the week.
2455460	2459140	It's the spiritual sequel to Strider.
2460500	2460980	Oh, yeah.
2461540	2464820	And then I got Dissidia Final Fantasy NX.
2465700	2468660	I actually didn't hear that one, but it was like $5.
2469540	2470040	So I bought it.
2471700	2472820	So, yeah.
2473540	2475460	I don't remember what was special about NX.
2475460	2479780	Dissidia was weird to me, but I probably didn't give it enough of a chance, to be honest.
2480500	2483380	Well, I just had a bunch of sales, so I just went for it.
2484740	2489620	But if anyone likes Strider, I absolutely suggest getting Osmond.
2489620	2493780	It's definitely the same sort of game, same creator, everything.
2496100	2496900	It was something else.
2496900	2499460	Oh, yeah, I played some World Cup soccer because, you know, that's my baby.
2500660	2501140	Nice.
2501140	2502260	All right, I'm done.
2502260	2502740	All right.
2502740	2503460	Loki, we'll go to you.
2503460	2504340	How was your gaming week?
2505220	2506500	I played a few things.
2506500	2511220	Actually, funny enough, I played some games that were integrated in the Discord.
2511220	2516100	So we were messing with some of those in our community chat for the Channel 64 SMP.
2516100	2518500	So what was it?
2518500	2521220	Gardic Phone, which is kind of a...
2521220	2522180	Love Gardic Phone.
2522180	2523940	Yeah, they play that on Twitch all the time, yeah.
2524660	2530020	Gardic Phone, was it Know What I Meme, which is kind of funny.
2531300	2534420	That one's like Apples to Apples, but with memes.
2535460	2535780	OK.
2536500	2540020	And then Putt Party, which is just a miniature golf game.
2540020	2543140	I love miniature golf games, so that was fun.
2543140	2544020	Let's play that.
2544020	2546340	And then what else?
2546340	2547220	Playing another game.
2547220	2550180	It was another like card game, board game thing.
2550900	2552260	I don't remember what it was called, though.
2554180	2559060	But it was interesting and mostly Minecraft.
2559060	2560420	I've been playing lots of Minecraft.
2562020	2563140	I posted earlier.
2563140	2566100	I finally passed a thousand subs, which is great.
2567380	2573220	One step closer to getting monetized as the another 2000 watch hours within a year.
2573220	2577700	So that's a little hard because it goes down every single day.
2577700	2581540	Considering that, you know, a year ago, people watched my content and, you know,
2581540	2586500	we have to make sure that there's more content for them to watch and get that out those hours up.
2587300	2588420	So you have to do that.
2588420	2592100	And then I've been working on a lot for this next episode.
2592100	2596660	Facts so much so that I'm probably going to have to cut it in two because there's too much
2597300	2598740	too much for the episode.
2598740	2601220	But I've already got there's another big
2602900	2605300	Mega Man enemy build.
2605300	2606580	Oh, yeah, the big one.
2606580	2606900	Good.
2606900	2609220	So and it's fantastic looking.
2610180	2617780	I've got more big structures for another robot masters area that look really cool and
2619220	2621220	lots of like terraforming and stuff in that area.
2621220	2625220	So I'm probably going to do half of that area because it's actually like a third of the
2625220	2626420	the entire base area.
2626420	2628260	So like, I can't do that all in one episode.
2628260	2629300	That'd be just ridiculous.
2629860	2635060	So I'm going to cut in two and then but yeah, there will be a lot of content just there.
2635060	2637140	So I'm very excited to get that done.
2637220	2639780	Hopefully this week I wanted to get done this weekend.
2639780	2641300	There's no way that was going to happen.
2643700	2645460	All right, I understand.
2646180	2651300	OK, my gaming week, some of the same old stuff playing a little more Final Fantasy 14.
2651300	2653060	I played a little bit of Dead by Daylight.
2653060	2656660	I think I even did like two matches with Jamie at very randomly at one point during the week.
2656660	2657300	I can remember.
2657300	2659220	Yeah, one was really short and stinky.
2659220	2660500	Yeah, I had a really fun one.
2660500	2661220	Yeah, yeah.
2661220	2662820	So but I even did some killer matches.
2662820	2664420	I played my first Wesker game ever.
2664420	2665460	Oh, it did not go well.
2665460	2667380	I'm not good at zipping across.
2667380	2669700	I was not connecting with survivors.
2669700	2671620	It just takes a little time to get used to, I'm sure.
2672340	2674900	Seven seconds is all I have to play with you.
2674900	2675220	Yeah.
2675220	2680740	So I just I went back to Miss Plague because her and the throw in the vomit and all that,
2680740	2681700	that I can do that.
2681700	2683220	Mommy, mommy.
2683220	2685300	It breaks a lot.
2685300	2690900	The reason why I like Plague is it's a different meta for the survivors than what they're usually
2690900	2694820	prepared for, especially right now, a lot of big healing builds.
2694820	2697460	And it's like with Plague, a lot of that goes out the window.
2697460	2702260	Like and when I like to because, you know, I like to play my immersive Lisa, where I
2702260	2704340	go as a nurse and I take healing stuff.
2704340	2709780	So I'll take like Botany, the Yoichi perk that shows where you are sometimes will make
2709780	2713220	it take a lot of the healing perks and do my immersive nurse.
2713220	2717060	And when I go up against a plague, I'm like, I'm useless.
2717060	2722180	I'm literally I literally can't do anything in this fight because long story short, I
2722180	2723460	used to be a plague main.
2723460	2724340	So yeah.
2724340	2727300	And for those who don't follow the game, how can I explain this succinctly?
2727300	2730260	The plague has a mechanic where she vomits on you.
2730260	2734820	And so if you've been vomited on, you can't heal because you still have vomit.
2734820	2739700	Basically, you have to cleanse the vomit and you get you get a free heal when you do that.
2739700	2740180	Yes.
2740180	2740900	Yes.
2740900	2746100	So but after after you cleanse, though, the pool that you cleanse in turns red and then
2746100	2749780	she can wash in it or something and we get what we call danger puke.
2749780	2750420	Yeah.
2750420	2750980	Yeah.
2750980	2754820	And if it doesn't make you sick, but but it counts as a hit.
2754820	2755220	Yes.
2755220	2757540	Long distance hits and she's tall.
2758340	2762260	She's taller than most than most of the the other killers.
2762260	2762760	Yeah.
2763140	2766660	Which was hard for me to learn her because I'm better with the shorter people.
2766660	2770020	I think only Nemesis is about as tall, to be honest.
2770020	2770660	So yeah.
2770660	2773300	So anyway, other games I've played this week.
2773300	2778260	So I've spent most of my gaming week actually on Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster.
2778260	2780020	I played the first game.
2780020	2782500	I actually streamed the entirety of that game.
2782500	2787700	I did like two hours on Monday and then I did like six hours, maybe five and a half on Friday.
2787700	2789940	I played that entire game on stream start to finish.
2791300	2793860	And yeah, I had a good time playing it.
2793860	2795540	I enjoyed the pixel remasters.
2795540	2799620	I think the boosting that they put in the game was great because you can do four times
2799620	2803220	experience and four times Gil and it just takes the grind completely out.
2804180	2807060	It also takes the challenge completely out.
2807060	2811460	So if you're somebody like me who just kind of wants to go down memory lane and revisit
2811460	2815380	this classic game you really like, then I think the boosting is a great way to do it.
2815380	2819780	But like if it's your very first time playing it and you're about to form your entire impression
2819780	2824660	of Final Fantasy based on that, I think you need to be very aware if you're going to boost
2824660	2828660	that you are boosting and the game was not originally designed in the way you're about
2828660	2833300	to play it because I will tell you because of that, nothing gave me a challenge in that
2833300	2835460	game until the very last boss.
2836820	2842100	I think the typical level to be when you beat the original Final Fantasy is around 45 or
2842100	2842980	50.
2842980	2844500	I was level 69.
2845220	2846740	Yes, I was.
2846740	2847240	Yes.
2848020	2853220	When I fought Chaos and that was well, because of the way things are going on.
2853220	2855860	So you can also turn the encounters on and off.
2855860	2862820	And so when I hit 69, I turned off the encounters so that I could beat Chaos at level 69.
2862820	2865220	So because I was in the last dungeon already when that happened.
2865220	2869140	So Bobby says the original NES version had a level 50 cap.
2869140	2870340	Oh, I didn't even realize that.
2870900	2872340	I always thought I'd let you go to 99.
2872900	2878180	When I play my classic RPGs, because I've actually played most of them, I play with,
2878180	2879780	you know, the codes on.
2881380	2882500	But it's the same thing.
2882500	2885380	It's still, you know, it still took me a good seven hours to play through it.
2885860	2889140	I could have probably, you know, because Shane kept telling me throughout the stream, just
2889140	2892340	turn the encounters off, just turn the encounters off and just fight the monsters and treasure
2892340	2892660	chests.
2892660	2893460	You'll be fine.
2893460	2896740	But I was like, I want to try to fill up the bestiary.
2896740	2899860	I want to try to have some monsters I get to fight and do that thing.
2899860	2904260	And so, you know, I did still leave on random encounters for most of it.
2904260	2908340	There was a point probably when I got to about the fourth hour on the second stream, I was
2908340	2911780	like, all right, if I keep seeing the same things over and over on a floor, I'm going
2911780	2915060	to turn off the encounters and just get through the floor and then go to the next floor.
2915060	2918900	So it helped the second half of the game move a little quicker than the first half.
2918900	2920740	But yeah, I had a good time with it.
2920740	2925780	And if you enjoy the classic Final Fantasy games or you're just curious about them, I
2925780	2927140	think the pixel remasters are great.
2927780	2929540	I'm looking forward to playing more of them.
2929540	2932740	I'm probably going to get sidetracked now that I picked up Stranger in Paradise.
2933620	2938500	But because Stranger in Paradise ties into the original Final Fantasy, now seems like
2938500	2939780	a good time to play it.
2939780	2943620	So I'm going to start streaming that next week, probably Tuesday.
2944420	2946100	I just had a crazy random thought.
2947140	2952900	What if they did Final Fantasy 7 pixel remaster and actually released it as a pixel-based
2952900	2953220	game?
2953220	2958340	Well, you know, they had the final, you know, the Chinese bootleg aside, because somebody
2958340	2959700	will say they did that.
2959700	2960900	That was a Chinese bootleg.
2961460	2967300	But the other thing that was official was there was a Final Fantasy 15, was it Pocket
2967300	2972260	Edition, I think it was called, where they took Final Fantasy 15 and made it a more traditional
2972260	2973300	Final Fantasy game.
2974580	2975780	And so they did have that.
2975780	2979620	So I could see something like that happening with Final Fantasy 7 at some point.
2979620	2983780	But they're more focused on these remake and rebirth series right now.
2983780	2986020	But it could make an interesting tie-in at some point.
2986740	2992660	So anyway, one other game that I played this week.
2992660	2993700	This is very random.
2993700	2994500	You ready for this?
2994500	2996260	I randomly decided to pick up.
2996260	2997300	Here we go again.
2997300	3001780	I played Skyrim a little bit because here's why.
3001780	3008420	Because I didn't realize that at some point in the last year, the Special Edition finally
3008420	3009460	went on Game Pass.
3010020	3013380	Because when that first came out, they didn't put it on Game Pass right away.
3014100	3018260	It was only the original Skyrim Edition you could do.
3018260	3023540	So I wanted to see like the 4K Pretty Pretty Edition, because you might remember I bought
3023540	3024900	this computer a year ago.
3024900	3028660	I feel like when I bought this computer, I wanted to put Skyrim on it, but they didn't
3028660	3031620	have, you couldn't get the Special Edition yet in Game Pass.
3031620	3034660	So at some point, they put that on Game Pass and I noticed it.
3034660	3037700	I was like, oh, I want to try the pretty 4K version of Skyrim.
3037700	3042420	And I've been playing it and it is pretty and 4K and it's been fun.
3042420	3048500	I turned the difficulty down to Bobby Black Wolf mode just so I could have fun playing
3048500	3048900	it.
3048900	3051940	And I'm just like, I want to set everything on fire.
3051940	3053220	No, it's electricity.
3053220	3055300	I'm going to zap everything with a lightning bolt.
3055300	3056980	And so that's just what I've been doing in Skyrim.
3057940	3061620	Hello, monster, and just zapping everything with lightning.
3061620	3064100	So that's and that's not usually how I play those games.
3064100	3066180	I'm almost always a sword and shield person.
3066180	3068900	So it's kind of fun being a little bit more magicky.
3071140	3074980	That's been my gaming week, pretty much Pixel Remasters and Skyrim.
3075620	3079780	So, all right, we got some more gaming news to get into.
3079780	3082740	So let's get to it and talk about what is going on in gaming.
3082740	3084660	I do it at just quick programming note.
3084660	3086820	Bobby won't be here next week, but we will be.
3086820	3090020	So if you are going to listen live on Sunday night, just be aware you're not going to hear
3090020	3090900	Bobby beforehand.
3090900	3092100	So you might be like, what happened?
3092100	3093460	Did things get canceled tonight?
3094180	3097780	Bobby's got a conflict, but we will be here next week for sure.
3098340	3099620	Also, shout out to Bobby.
3099620	3101540	I'm sure many of you already listen to his show.
3101540	3107060	If you are not already aware, he will be doing some announcing at Summer Games Done Quick,
3107060	3111780	which is going to be live and in person in a couple of weeks up in Minneapolis, I think,
3111780	3112500	or that area.
3113380	3117060	So it's not by the Mall of America like it was last time.
3117060	3119380	I think he says in downtown Minneapolis this time.
3119380	3124740	So regardless of those types of organizational things, Bobby's going to be one of the announcers.
3125620	3130660	But it's also a great charity event that brings a lot of the world's best speedrunners together.
3130660	3132100	And it's a lot of fun to watch.
3132660	3134180	So check that out.
3134180	3135540	That's coming up in a couple of weeks.
3136580	3137300	Yeah.
3137300	3142260	And Bobby clarifies, yes, it's downtown this time, but the train goes to the Mall of America.
3143140	3146100	So that's coming up for Bobby in a few weeks.
3147460	3149700	We won't be here on May 21st.
3149700	3152580	And I know that is a very random night to be off.
3153220	3154900	It's a day job conflict for me.
3154900	3155620	I can't be here.
3157140	3159060	The job that pays the bills has to come first.
3159060	3160500	And it's as simple as that.
3160500	3168100	So all right, let's move on and get into some news.
3168100	3169460	And I'll start off with Loki.
3170420	3182980	Yeah, so the UK has blocked the Microsoft Activision acquisition deal, and the CMA basically
3182980	3191220	cited that the merger would result in them dominating the cloud gaming space because
3191220	3194020	Game Pass is doing pretty well and all that stuff.
3194020	3198180	They said, We have concluded that the merger would result in the most powerful operator
3198260	3203060	in the fast developing market for cloud gaming, with the current market share of 60 to 70%
3203060	3208820	acquiring a portfolio of world leading games with the incentive to withhold those games
3208820	3216340	from competitors and substantially weaken competition in this important growing market.
3217220	3222180	Which is weird because they have been reaching out to other cloud gaming services to say,
3222180	3224820	hey, we'll put Call of Duty on there for 10 years, at least.
3225380	3226660	I will sign that deal.
3226900	3233540	So I'm not really sure where they're saying that they're going to like hurt cloud gaming
3233540	3233780	and stuff.
3233780	3238580	And I'm also not really sure how much of like Call of Duty sales is actually cloud gaming
3238580	3239940	either, which is kind of interesting.
3239940	3243060	So when you get into the nuts and bolts of the whole argument, people have been talking
3243060	3244020	about this in our Discord.
3244020	3248420	And if you want to see more over at vognetwork.com, why can't I talk tonight?
3248420	3250580	Vognetwork.com Discord.
3250580	3252420	And we have chats throughout the week.
3252420	3254740	And there's some very interesting excerpts from the whole thing.
3254740	3258020	And one of them basically alludes to, and I'm going to make a long story very, very
3258020	3263460	short here, is basically alluding to the fact that, well, Stadia didn't have Call of Duty
3264020	3265700	and Stadia failed.
3265700	3268260	Therefore, Stadia failed because it didn't have Call of Duty.
3270660	3271540	That is dumb.
3271540	3272260	I know.
3272260	3272900	I know.
3272900	3277220	It is 100% with you all.
3277220	3279700	Stadia failed for a multitude of reasons.
3280340	3283220	And it's all with the business and none of the technical.
3283220	3290980	And to me, I also look at some of my Stadia and I look at Destiny 2 or our beloved Dead
3290980	3291700	by Daylight.
3292500	3296420	Dark Soccer, you streamed, you've put a lot of hours into Dead by Daylight and you were
3296420	3301380	like the biggest Stadia Dead by Daylight streamer out there, at least as far as I know of.
3301380	3305540	How many other Twitch people did you run into that streamed Dead by Daylight on Stadia?
3307140	3308500	Not on Twitch.
3308500	3311060	I found, actually, I take that back.
3311060	3319540	Well, I didn't know if they streamed or not, but I found another person in, I think they
3319540	3324900	were the killer in our match or something like that, but they also played on Stadia
3324900	3325460	on a Mac.
3327140	3330100	And I was like, hello, fellow unicorn.
3331060	3337940	And we chatted over it and it was pretty cool, but it's only ever happened the once.
3337940	3338440	Right.
3339700	3345540	And I mean, and now I'm on GeForce and people are still surprised that I'm, I mean, which
3345540	3347540	is technically through my Steam account.
3347540	3348040	Right.
3348740	3353860	But it's still having to use a cloud-based service to be able to log into my game.
3354580	3361300	So, and I just want to note with all of this is that number one is that if there were,
3361300	3366020	if that was the problem, what is turning up in this that, you know, because Stadia didn't
3366100	3367860	have Call of Duty, that's why Stadia failed.
3367860	3370740	Like, look at the other games that are multi-platform.
3371300	3376820	Stadia was a blip, a drop in the ocean on those other platforms.
3376820	3381780	Like, Call of Duty being on Stadia would not have made, because you know what?
3381780	3385300	Call of Duty could have been on Stadia, but Phil Harrison still would have been the executive
3385300	3387140	and it still would have been a Google-owned company.
3387140	3389460	Therefore, it still would have failed for all the same reasons.
3389460	3391380	Can somebody send that to the courts?
3391460	3395540	It's also a completely different pricing structure.
3395540	3399140	And so the reason Stadia failed, obviously, and they probably don't realize this either,
3399140	3406020	is it's like, imagine if you had a Netflix, but then instead of getting to watch all those
3406020	3410020	programs for free with your subscription, you just had to buy them all.
3410900	3412980	Like, no one wants to do that.
3412980	3416980	And so obviously, yeah, Game Pass, you know, does well.
3416980	3419140	I mean, but Game Pass is just one part of it.
3420100	3424500	Nothing saying that, you know, you couldn't put Game Pass on PlayStation.
3424500	3429780	You have EA and Ubisoft have their streaming services and they're on all the consoles.
3429780	3431620	Like, why couldn't you do the same?
3431620	3433620	Like, it's just silly.
3434660	3439060	It's also silly because they don't look at like, what about like going back to Netflix
3439060	3440500	and like Disney and stuff like that?
3440500	3444100	What about all those exclusive deals that they have with TV shows and stuff like that?
3444100	3446900	Does the UK regulators have problems with that?
3446980	3449860	Because that's unfair to like the office.
3449860	3451620	Is it on all the streaming services?
3451620	3452660	That's just not fair.
3453220	3455460	Like, I'm sorry, but like, that's not how it works.
3455460	3460660	And and I think that the fact that they said, yeah, you know, we'll put it on those services
3460660	3461780	for 10 years.
3461780	3463460	I think that's more than fair.
3463460	3468740	Like, by by the way, like, it shouldn't be in perpetuity because like, come up with your
3468740	3469140	own shit.
3469140	3471460	I mean, seriously, like, sorry.
3471460	3472420	Going to a comment from chat.
3473220	3478340	Matt says, whoever put that claim in cough, Sony cough, knew what they were doing.
3478340	3483380	They knew that the CMA wasn't going to double check the context for that very broad subjective
3483380	3486340	statement that that is the most infuriating thing.
3486340	3489060	That is the most infuriating thing because I bet it was Sony that put it.
3489060	3490900	I mean, can't prove it, but I bet it was.
3490900	3491860	Sony put it in.
3491860	3492340	You know what?
3492340	3493620	Did you did everybody forget?
3493620	3494740	Did the UK forget?
3494740	3496340	Did every what happened?
3497060	3501860	Sony bought a cloud gaming company years ago.
3501860	3502820	Did you all forget?
3504180	3508020	Gaikai, they bought Gaikai and created PlayStation Now out of it.
3508020	3510500	Sony has cloud gaming.
3511620	3515300	They're not using it to its full potential.
3515300	3517540	How is that Microsoft's fault?
3519140	3519860	I don't get it.
3520500	3526820	Why is it Microsoft's fault that Nintendo continues to lag behind in these advancing
3526820	3527220	actually?
3527220	3532180	No, Nintendo does have cloud gaming stuff on the switch.
3532180	3534820	It's just it's implemented funky, whatever.
3534820	3536740	So how is this Microsoft's fault?
3537780	3540420	It's the other companies are doing cloud gaming.
3540420	3542980	It's their choice on how they're implementing it.
3542980	3547860	And even even with companies implementing it, several of the voice, Dark Soccer, I don't
3547860	3552500	mean to put you on the spot, but like Dead by Daylight, that's your bread and butter
3552500	3553460	for streaming.
3553460	3562020	So when Stadia closed, you had a choice and you sampled.
3562020	3565220	I remember there was another one based out of Europe that you were thinking about going
3565220	3566420	with, but that's it.
3566420	3569540	But the lag kind of was too much of an issue.
3569540	3574820	But hypothetically, Dead by Daylight is on xCloud.
3574820	3580740	You could have gone to Microsoft's cloud based gaming to stream Dead by Daylight, but
3580740	3582660	you went with GeForce Now.
3583300	3584820	Is there is there a reason?
3584820	3587060	Because nothing else had Dead by Daylight.
3587060	3588100	I thought Xbox did.
3589380	3594260	Well, yeah, I could have gotten it through the Windows Store, but I'm not on a Windows
3594260	3594660	machine.
3596260	3596820	Worked for me.
3598180	3599860	So there's there's other had.
3599860	3602180	Yeah, I had to use something that compatible.
3602980	3610260	So my point being that Microsoft is not as like all in, you know, that has a chokehold
3610260	3613620	on this space like this is being led to believe.
3613620	3618740	And look, I'm not trying to be I don't want people to be like, oh, Rob's a Microsoft fan
3618740	3619060	boy.
3619060	3622420	Rob's just, you know, gassing up Microsoft and all this stuff.
3622420	3628740	Look, that's not there's there's two reasons why I want this merger to go through number
3628740	3632020	well or or reasons why I feel that we're on the same mind zone.
3632020	3632980	That was for sure.
3632980	3636500	There's two reasons why I guess I should say I think this merger should go through.
3636500	3638260	Let me let me correct.
3638260	3647780	Number one, Activision Blizzard has a toxic issue at the head of the company.
3647780	3651460	I'm talking about the and I've said that you all know how I feel if this is your first
3651460	3653620	OLR, then I'm sorry this coming up.
3653620	3656500	Well, but I'm not sorry because this is an issue in the industry that has to be dealt
3656500	3657060	with.
3657060	3664820	The CEO, the board, the senior leadership at Activision Blizzard is an actively toxic
3665460	3668900	element in our industry that is so toxic.
3668900	3670260	It's spreading.
3670260	3675300	It is actively hurting the industry as a whole, not just Activision Blizzard.
3675300	3677540	It must be dealt with.
3677540	3682340	And if a big fish eating another big fish, as much as I don't always like that, if that
3682340	3688020	is the only way to eliminate the toxicity out of the industry, then so be it.
3688020	3690180	And for that reason, this merger must go through.
3690180	3698580	And second of all is that in this case, I'm just going to just add real quick that this
3698580	3702340	case, it's definitely a matter of the greater good.
3702340	3702580	Yes.
3703620	3708260	And the second thing is why I believe the merger should still go through is that with
3708260	3712660	Microsoft in the cloud, Microsoft, yes, cloud gaming is the future.
3713220	3716340	Yes, I would say Microsoft has a jumpstart on this.
3716420	3722580	That is not Microsoft's fault for that.
3723220	3724180	I'm sorry.
3724180	3726980	Sony has the ability to do this.
3727700	3728660	They don't.
3728660	3732340	Sony willingly signed with the Azure platform.
3733620	3738980	Nintendo could do this and does do it to an extent, I guess, on the cartridges if they
3738980	3739540	wanted to.
3740500	3742900	We all know Nintendo lags behind in the tech space.
3742900	3744740	That's not their bread and butter, whatever.
3745060	3749540	This is not Microsoft's fault that the rest of the industry is lagging behind them.
3749540	3756900	This is not because of competitive agreements, that's not what Microsoft's doing.
3756900	3761700	So this argument doesn't make sense, but here we are.
3761700	3763860	We're stuck because guess what?
3763860	3765060	They can appeal it.
3765060	3769300	It might get overturned on appeal, but history shows it probably won't be.
3770260	3777700	So at this point, either the whole thing gets called off or the UK ends up getting excluded
3777700	3779380	from this, which could be very interesting.
3780100	3787380	Meaning that it would be similar to what happened in Belgium with loot boxes, where some of
3787380	3790020	those games that EA does, they just don't release in Belgium.
3790020	3795700	So Call of Duty may just not be on any cloud service in the UK.
3795700	3802260	We'll be playing it over here on cloud, but you won't get it over there because of your
3802260	3803220	regulatory bodies.
3804580	3806900	That could be something that happens.
3806900	3812420	I don't know if it will, because to be fair, we're dunking on the UK because the US stuff
3812420	3813780	hasn't started yet.
3813780	3819700	And for all I know, I actually would err on the side of the arguments that are going to
3819700	3825060	come out of the US court are going to be just as ridiculous, if not more so, probably more
3825060	3825780	so.
3825780	3830660	This is the appetizer to the main course, y'all.
3836660	3838900	Bobby Black Wolf also points out an important point.
3839460	3844020	The streaming on Nintendo games is run by the third parties.
3844020	3846580	Nintendo doesn't actually do the streaming themselves.
3847140	3852580	And fixation gaze in chat hits the nail on the head here with, I think, what's the game
3852580	3854100	Sony's playing here.
3854100	3855860	Sony just wants to be the big fish.
3856740	3857460	Yep.
3857460	3860900	That's exactly where the fall through.
3860900	3864100	And they were to get the opportunity to try to purchase Activision.
3864100	3865060	They would do it.
3865060	3866740	They would absolutely do it.
3867300	3868500	And we'd be back in this.
3868500	3871780	And then you'd watch it probably go in the opposite direction because that's how the
3871780	3872500	world works.
3874500	3880660	I swear, if Sony tries to do this, that now I'm really going to be in a conundrum because
3880660	3883940	I do want that toxicity out of the industry and everything I said is true.
3883940	3887140	But it's going to be one of those things are like, oh, I'm so mad at Sony.
3887140	3888260	I'm so mad at Sony.
3888260	3890980	It shouldn't be Sony for the same reason.
3890980	3892660	If Microsoft can't have them, Sony shouldn't have them.
3893540	3898580	It's just like we're a smaller player and, you know, we're a smaller player in the cloud
3898580	3899380	services.
3899380	3902420	And so this will level the playing field for us so that we can be competitive.
3902420	3904500	They'll be like, okay, and they'll do it.
3904500	3906340	And like, it's just going to happen.
3906340	3911540	Yeah, that's just how it's going to work because regulators and I'm sorry, like people in
3911540	3912820	government are just stupid.
3912820	3916660	They're complete morons, especially when it comes to tech because they're old and already
3916660	3919220	they just drop themselves in the grave.
3919220	3923060	But like, you know, eventually we'll get people in there that actually understand how the
3923060	3924100	internet and things work.
3924100	3929220	But right now we got idiots that like listen to lobbyists and that's just how it works.
3929220	3936900	If it was Sony's lawyers that caused this to happen with those statements, Sony ought
3936900	3941460	to be obligated to invest in their cloud platform more.
3942180	3945540	But that's not the way business works, unfortunately.
3945540	3948740	But it's going to be up to the users to demand it.
3948740	3951380	And it's up to the mainstream press.
3951380	3953700	This will never happen, but I'm going to say it anyway.
3953700	3957620	It's up to the mainstream press to call them out on it in interviews.
3957620	3958580	Call them out on it.
3959780	3962580	The Microsoft deal didn't go through because of cloud gaming.
3962580	3965620	What are you doing to enhance your cloud gaming in the competitive space?
3965620	3967940	What is Sony working on with cloud gaming?
3967940	3975620	It just, it's, it's, I just wish these companies got asked more on the bigger, but that's,
3975620	3980580	you know, if a press outlet asked that, they'd never get another interview again.
3980580	3981860	And unfortunately that's how it works.
3982740	3983620	It just stinks.
3984180	3984980	It stinks.
3984980	3986900	There's a story that they want to perpetuate.
3989380	3993380	That's, and so then, then in turn, that's why I would also say that's why you can't
3993380	3994980	only listen to mainstream voices.
3994980	3999540	You have to listen to the people that are willing to say whatever, because we're, we're
3999540	4001540	not, we got nothing to lose.
4004020	4005140	Let me tell you, tell you what it is.
4005140	4007380	When I say we, I don't just mean OLR.
4007380	4011300	I mean other educated, independent gaming podcasters.
4012340	4013140	We're educated?
4013700	4014740	For the most part.
4014740	4015300	All right.
4015300	4015800	Okay.
4016660	4017300	Let's move on.
4017300	4018900	We've, we've got other stuff to cover tonight.
4018900	4022660	We could spend a lot of time getting angry about that, but let's, how about happy news?
4022660	4023620	I'm sorry.
4023620	4026420	This made my gay heart flutter and explode in rainbows.
4026420	4031860	And that was the samba de amigo party central first batch of songs that are coming to the
4031860	4032500	game.
4032500	4033540	I'm sorry.
4033540	4035140	This is gay rights.
4035140	4035540	Okay.
4035540	4037060	Don't be sorry about that.
4037060	4037940	I know.
4037940	4038500	Yeah, you're right.
4038500	4039780	I'm absolutely not sorry.
4039780	4040580	Not sorry.
4040580	4041300	Exactly.
4041860	4046980	So samba de amigo has songs and they've, they've announced what's coming out.
4046980	4052820	We've got Carly Rae Jepsen with I Really Like You, Ariana Grande, not just with Break
4052820	4059620	Three, Break Free, but with Bang Bang, which was the Jessie J and Nicki Minaj collaboration.
4059620	4061380	Tick Tock by Kesha.
4061380	4063460	Miley Cyrus with Plastic Hearts.
4064740	4065380	Who did I miss?
4065380	4067860	Oh, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor.
4067860	4072820	Only like one of the most iconic LGBT songs ever.
4072820	4073380	And then, yeah.
4073380	4075460	If ever there was a gay song, that is it.
4075460	4076260	I'm sorry.
4076260	4079300	Rina Sawayama is actually in this with XS?
4079940	4087380	Like who, who is the gay intern that threw all these into the pot for songs to license
4087380	4089620	because they should be promoted immediately.
4089620	4091620	Cause this is an amazing song list.
4092340	4095700	And we have a Ricky Martin with a Cup of Life and all that.
4097700	4098660	Icona Pop.
4099220	4101380	This is, this is incredible song list.
4101380	4101940	Incredible.
4102580	4105620	So is it, is it I Want It?
4106260	4106980	Yeah, yeah, it is.
4106980	4107700	I Want It.
4107700	4107940	Yeah.
4107940	4112180	And Def does point out, sadly, this game is definitely not streamer friendly.
4112180	4112740	Yes.
4112740	4116100	So if you stream it on Twitch, you're going to have to yank the archive.
4116100	4118260	Unfortunately, it's because of all the licensed music.
4118260	4122580	It's, it's not going to be a good stream or, or for that, for that stream, you'll have
4122580	4127060	to put your game capture on the track that doesn't save or, you know, that, that stuff.
4127060	4130260	So, cause yeah, this is heavy on licensed music.
4130260	4134260	I guess maybe you could get away with playing also on the song list.
4134260	4135860	There are covers.
4135860	4136340	That's right.
4136340	4140020	Cover bands of the Macarena and La Bamba.
4140740	4143140	So those, you could probably get away with playing on stream.
4145860	4151140	But you know, you know what I think would be really funny is, is people who are like
4151140	4153540	streaming and putting their video up online.
4153540	4160500	If they added in like their own, like, like music or elevator music that happens to be
4160500	4161460	the same tempo.
4161460	4162900	Yeah, that's, that's funny.
4162900	4164740	I would totally do that by the way.
4165940	4168740	Misha in chat points out they're missing one though.
4168740	4169780	Diana Ross.
4169780	4170580	Well, yes.
4170580	4175380	Sadly, an absence of Diana Ross, but we do know there are more songs coming.
4175380	4180740	Although some people expect this is probably the license list and we probably have like
4180740	4183620	Sega songs coming, which is going to be fine, you know, or other.
4183620	4185380	I need my Burning Rangers theme again.
4185380	4186100	I'm just saying.
4186100	4192420	So there, there's probably not a lot of licensed stuff left, but DLC question mark?
4193540	4195620	Depends how well the game does, I suppose.
4195620	4201380	So, but I know this, this went from being like a tiny little thing on my radar to like,
4201380	4204660	oh, you're getting this when it comes out.
4204660	4208420	So, uh, that's, that's how I feel about that song list for sure.
4209060	4209620	All right.
4209620	4213780	Well, speaking of going ons at Sega, another bit of excellent news, right Dark Sakura?
4215140	4216500	Yes, indeed.
4217700	4221540	So Sega of America staff has formed a union.
4222100	4222600	Yay.
4225860	4227060	Collaborative support.
4228740	4229540	Anyway.
4229540	4235700	They call it Aegis, Allied Employees Guild Improving Sega.
4235700	4239540	And they have partnered with the Communications Workers of America.
4240740	4241780	That is awesome.
4242420	4244580	I mean, especially with it being Sega.
4245220	4248340	I mean, my goodness that that's pretty amazing.
4248980	4256900	Um, but at any rate, um, they are already a super majority of 144 employees across the
4257540	4261940	various internal departments at Sega of America, of course, which is based out of Irvine.
4262580	4269460	Um, the announcement also claims the third of Sega's longtime workers don't have full-time
4269460	4271860	status, adequate training or bereavement leave.
4272820	4281940	So they're going to be working to bargain for improvement within the company, especially
4281940	4286980	for, uh, like here's some of the lists of, of, uh, requests.
4286980	4294100	So higher base pay that follows industry standards, um, with accommodation for the
4294100	4296660	raises being tied to the cost of living and inflation.
4297380	4301220	Improved stable benefits for all, including healthcare, retirement, remote work options,
4301220	4302180	and more.
4302180	4304420	I think the bereavement leave would be included with that.
4305060	4311380	Um, increased clearly outlined opportunities for advancement, balanced workloads and schedules,
4311380	4317700	and defined responsibilities for all positions, adequate staffing of departments to end patterns
4317700	4318820	of overwork.
4319620	4327060	Um, and I mean, that's, I mean, what other companies did at ZeniMax, uh, Blizzard?
4327060	4328500	Didn't someone else?
4328500	4332340	Oh, there's been, it's, it's, this is not the first and it's not going to be the last.
4333220	4334820	Biggest, I would say.
4334820	4342260	Sega has, I think a track record of having been iffy on some of their internal policies
4342260	4347380	and hiring practices, and hopefully this is going to stabilize it and make it a lot better
4347380	4349060	for the employees.
4350020	4354980	Um, yeah, I want to say the last time we had a union forming story, I want to say it was
4355220	4360100	Blizzard's, um, Vicarious Visions, I think when they acquired, that was the Diablo, the
4360100	4362980	Diablo 2 remake studio that Blizzard acquired.
4362980	4363220	Yeah.
4363860	4368900	And, and also I'm just going to say, I think that the name is great, you know, and Aegis
4368900	4373620	is a type of shield, you know, so I think that the name fits.
4373620	4375060	I'm glad they made the acronym work.
4375780	4376180	Excellent.
4376820	4377060	All right.
4377060	4379940	Well, like I said, not the first and won't be the last.
4379940	4382180	So, all right, moving on.
4382580	4386820	Loki, exciting changes with the long running store, right?
4388100	4390100	Yeah, well, it is changes at least.
4390900	4396500	So there's been some updates being done to the Steam interface.
4396500	4401380	So mainly the whole, like in-game tab that you have that you could see your achievements
4401380	4403780	and stuff, they're retooling that quite a bit.
4403780	4410820	And along with it, they're also adding, like a notes app that where you can like take,
4410820	4414900	you know, notes of basically whatever you're doing in game.
4415860	4418820	It reminds me of like the phone notes app that you have, basically.
4420660	4424900	I've literally done that, like in my Twitch chat, like No Man's Sky, I'll play No Man's
4424900	4428180	Sky and I'll be like, I want to come back to this planet later.
4428180	4429620	I need to remember the name.
4429620	4433620	So I'll go over to my Twitch chat and type the name and put like, when I come back later,
4433620	4435620	I'll scroll up and look at the name of that planet.
4435620	4437780	So, or galaxy or something like that.
4437780	4440740	So like, I get it, like a notes app would actually be super useful.
4441380	4442900	Yeah, I wonder if it saves it per game.
4442900	4444820	That would be kind of interesting to see if it does that.
4444820	4448660	But yeah, so basically they have it within app that you can do that.
4450500	4455780	They're just kind of changing the way that the overall toolbar looks as far as like they
4455780	4460260	said they have a toolbar that allows you to access like different pop up windows and clean
4460260	4466100	friends, chats, achievement progress, guides, discussions and your browser.
4466820	4467700	That's pretty cool.
4467700	4470820	Like you can open up all that stuff within a game.
4471780	4475060	Right now it's available through the Steam beta client, but I'm not sure when it's coming
4475060	4476820	to the actual full client though.
4476820	4477380	Probably soon.
4478260	4478820	All right.
4478820	4480100	Well, not everybody's a fan.
4480100	4484420	I noticed fixationgaze in our chat says, got to say the storefront looks super cluttered
4484420	4484740	now.
4484740	4485300	Not a fan.
4486020	4487780	So I don't know if that's, sorry.
4487780	4490980	I don't know if that's a comment about this particular beta or if that's just a general
4490980	4495220	comment about the store, which to be fair has felt cluttered for a bit.
4495300	4497220	Like there's just so much on it.
4497220	4498900	This isn't necessarily the storefront.
4498900	4500180	This is more of the in-game app.
4500180	4500420	I see.
4500420	4500580	Okay.
4500580	4501780	I misinterpreted the comment.
4501780	4502260	My bad.
4502260	4505380	The storefront is very cluttered.
4505380	4505860	Yes.
4505860	4506100	Yeah.
4507140	4509140	So all right.
4509140	4513380	Well, moving on, let's talk about a big game that released this week.
4513380	4516260	I don't think any of us have had a chance to check it out yet.
4516260	4517780	I know I've seen people on Twitch playing it.
4517780	4522900	That's about the furthest I've gotten, but Star Wars Jedi Survivor is out and there are
4522900	4528180	some accessibility options in the game that are kind of, you know, new and unique, including
4528180	4529620	a slow mode.
4530180	4532900	So in just not the game's performance.
4532900	4533620	No, it's not.
4534260	4537540	I hear it's having a real hard time of hitting 60 FPS.
4537540	4538980	Nothing to do with that.
4538980	4541620	It's not even, this is also on consoles.
4541620	4547060	So you can fully remap the controls, subtitle, visual options, all the things that ought
4547060	4549060	to be base kit at this point, but okay.
4549060	4552420	I mean, yay that they're doing that and different difficulty settings.
4552500	4555540	So if you want to play on Bobby Black Wolf mode, or if you want to play on nightmare
4555540	4557540	mode or whatever, you can do that.
4559460	4565540	But slow mode will allow you to slow all of the action to help make the play easier.
4565540	4568740	You can also just auto activate it on combat.
4568740	4572340	And I have to say that's one of the things I was looking forward to a Final Fantasy 16
4572340	4576100	as well when they were showing that off is that they have an item that you can equip
4576100	4581060	that will only like when an attack is coming in, it just slows at that moment and gives
4581060	4584820	you an extra time to hit the defense trigger than it normally would.
4584820	4589780	And for me, that's great because like dodging and blocking is literally the worst thing
4589780	4590980	I do in games.
4590980	4594180	So having that slowed down for me, I think is going to be great.
4594180	4598340	So I love that it's implemented in its own way here as well.
4598340	4599380	I think that's great.
4599380	4603780	So five difficulty settings in the game from story mode to Jedi Grandmaster is the name
4603780	4606660	of the hardcore mode or whatever.
4607300	4608900	But yeah, yay accessibility.
4608900	4610740	It's nice to see the big studios.
4610740	4615460	And to be fair, for all the shit EA has gotten over the years and rightfully so, I do feel
4615460	4620260	like accessibility and that whole thing, they do pretty good on that front.
4620260	4624420	But yes, Loki, the other criticisms you're putting out there as far as here we go again
4624420	4628900	with some of the bugs and things that should have been fixed before release.
4628900	4631460	Yeah, that part, not so great.
4632100	4638580	So as Joan Hunter Matt in chat says, kudos to the industry for taking accessibility seriously.
4638580	4642740	And Bobby Blackwolf pointing out another game that does this very well, Forza Horizon 5
4642740	4643940	also does this very well.
4645140	4650020	Quest Buster says a lot of improved accessibility though in lots of games and services.
4650020	4651860	It's gotten a lot better in the last 10 years.
4651860	4656020	So it's been warming to see they even have their own award category.
4656980	4662740	Quest Buster in chat says, survivor's performance issues regrettably smother all of the positives
4662740	4664740	that it does well, such as the story.
4664740	4668580	Some have said that it's one of the best Star Wars story told, period.
4672100	4676260	All right, Bobby Blackwolf says, so nothing about the spiders or did I miss that?
4676260	4678500	Oh, is that I did I miss that?
4678500	4678980	Yep.
4678980	4680660	They have a mode that turns out spiders.
4680660	4681380	Oh, that's nice.
4681380	4684500	That makes me think of so Grounded.
4684580	4690500	You remember that game had that is that you could turn the spiders into just like, I guess
4690500	4691460	they're like orbs.
4692260	4696260	Like they don't they don't look like it's like baseball, baseball 2000 or whatever,
4696260	4697460	which I laugh.
4697460	4701140	But that's actually a great thing for people that, like, seriously have issues when it
4701140	4702260	comes to spiders.
4702260	4703620	That's cool that you can do that.
4703620	4710100	And like, you know, like if you're seeing these gray baseball 2000, you're like, I opted
4710100	4710980	into that.
4710980	4714900	So I'm not going to hold the game responsible because these enemies look a little tacky.
4714900	4716100	I opted into that.
4716100	4720500	And I'm thankful that I'm not seeing a spider right now because so
4721380	4726340	well, if only they would do something like that for snails and slugs, I would be happy
4726340	4731940	because that's my massive disgusting phobia is to the point that if I see one of those
4731940	4736900	weird mollusks in my house, it doesn't matter what time it is, I will wake up Dan and say
4736900	4738100	go take care of this for me.
4738740	4742900	Do those, well, I guess because I didn't even think spiders existed in Star Wars.
4742900	4744820	But I was like, do those exist in Star Wars?
4744820	4748500	But there are always invertebrates.
4748500	4749000	Yeah.
4750020	4756340	Bobby points out that the instead of what's happening with Grounded where you change what
4756340	4761300	the spiders look like, Bobby says it removes the spiders completely so it makes the game
4761300	4762180	easier.
4762180	4767700	And of course, you know, there are those hardcore gamers out there that take themselves so
4767700	4774740	seriously, they are offended because the game got easier for someone else.
4774740	4775940	And it ruined my day.
4781540	4782740	I got nothing.
4782740	4783540	People are silly.
4783540	4784660	I got nothing.
4784660	4785700	I need a new story.
4785700	4787220	Let's talk about the next story.
4787220	4788020	Dark Sakura.
4789540	4790260	Vampires.
4791860	4793300	Kids like vampires, right?
4793300	4793780	Heck yeah.
4793780	4795220	Is this New Castlevania?
4796260	4796900	No, damn it.
4796900	4798260	It's Vampire Survivor.
4798260	4799460	Okay, that game's pretty rad too.
4801140	4807300	It's actually in works right now to be an animated television series coming out from
4807300	4808100	Story Kitchen.
4808820	4817140	And they are partnering with the game's developer, Ponkel, the founder of, sorry, the Ponkel
4817140	4824260	founder, Luca Galante, I guess, to adapt it into a full-on animated TV series.
4827140	4831940	I wonder how it would work given what the weird gameplay of it is like.
4833220	4840340	But the story is that it's set in 2021 rural Italy where there was, hold on, I'll just
4840340	4842100	read the quote from the description.
4842100	4848660	There lived an evil person named Bisconti Dracula, whose many evil magics created a
4848660	4851620	bad world filled with famine and suffering.
4851620	4857540	It's now up to the members of the Belpasse family to end his reign of terror and return
4857540	4858500	good food to the table.
4860180	4864420	But you know what's, okay, the thing about Vampires Virus, I love that game, but it's
4864420	4870660	very clearly heavily influenced by Castlevania, like right on down to how some of the sprites
4870660	4871380	look and things.
4871380	4876740	So it's only a little surprising to me because Castlevania, also an animated TV show.
4877540	4881780	But the Dracula myth is public domain.
4881780	4882500	True, true.
4883140	4886820	The iconography of Dracula is public domain.
4887860	4888660	I guess that's true.
4889380	4892020	So yeah.
4892020	4892900	It is just interesting.
4892900	4897620	And on top of that, it looks like it's going to be a completely different story.
4897620	4905620	I think the Castlevania one is set more in the Eastern European area, and this looks
4905620	4907700	like it's in Italy in the modern day.
4908820	4913220	So there's quite a bit of difference on this one.
4913860	4921220	And honestly enough, if Konami knows what's smart for them, they would partner with the
4921220	4924100	game's creator to do a Castlevania chapter.
4924100	4927140	Well, and this is another indie darling.
4927140	4928420	It's a completely different kind of game.
4929140	4932660	I know, yeah, the gameplay is obviously completely different, but it's just interesting.
4932660	4935620	Like, it feels heavily inspired.
4935620	4935940	That's all.
4935940	4937220	But you're right.
4937220	4942740	Dracula itself is in the, you know, but what was I going to say with this?
4942740	4946580	Oh, this seems like it's really now official.
4946580	4950660	You kind of knew it from watching Twitch, but this is the official latest indie darling
4950660	4953540	to just catch fire and end up in mainstream media.
4953540	4957460	This joins a line of games I would argue started with Minecraft, quite frankly.
4957460	4960980	I mean, I know Minecraft is not indie anymore, but certainly that.
4960980	4967620	But then even after that, you had things like Five Nights at Freddy's, Undertale, you
4967620	4972500	know, these indie games that are now on target shelves with licensing.
4973540	4979220	Well, and it's also, you know, they were the rush of indie horror games.
4980820	4989140	You know, like I watched Holly playing one that looked like it was like an old floppy
4989140	4992740	disk game and it had glitching and everything, but the glitching was part of the game.
4992740	4993140	I don't remember.
4993140	4994820	Yes, I thought I would too.
4994820	4998100	I think timely enough, there's a new Amnesia game like this week, too.
4998820	5000420	Let's speak of indie horror stuff.
5000420	5000920	Yeah.
5001540	5006980	But the thing about it is that this game is more like, you know, Smash TV on crack.
5006980	5007480	Yeah.
5008500	5017860	I mean, Smash TV on a crack bender is what it is, you know, and I wonder how they're
5017860	5027620	going to incorporate that flooding of enemies aspect into the game or into the show in a
5027620	5031460	believable manner, or I would say in a visually tolerable manner.
5032020	5036980	On a completely different note, talking about like indie darlings that are catching fire
5036980	5040340	and showing up on target shelves eventually into mainstream media.
5041220	5045140	Do you know what game seems to be headed for that right now based on Twitch, like the latest
5045140	5046340	indie game that's shown up?
5046340	5049380	And I don't know if it's just a bias because I see a lot of Dead by Daylight streamers,
5049380	5050660	which is what I usually follow.
5050660	5053140	I don't know if it's because this is the game I see a lot of them playing or if it's really
5053780	5055140	it's that Deceive Inc.
5055700	5056500	Have you seen that one?
5057940	5058180	Yeah.
5058180	5062580	I feel like tons of people are playing Deceive Inc. all of a sudden, which admittedly I haven't
5062580	5067700	actually sat down and watched a lot of it, but it feels like it mixes kind of like some
5067700	5074420	of the first person stuff with like Among Us type of thing and that whole with like characters
5074420	5075700	like Clue or something.
5075860	5081300	It seems very interesting, but it seems like that might be the latest indie up and comer
5081300	5083940	on Steam or on Twitch and all that.
5083940	5091300	So now our chat is going down a different tangent train because the talk of animated
5091300	5095220	shows brought us to something that I don't think we've brought up on the show.
5095220	5099380	And that is, this is about a month old at this point, but the news that they are making
5099380	5104500	a Scott Pilgrim TV show out of, I believe it's adapted from the original anime series,
5104500	5104660	right?
5104660	5108260	The anime, but the, the huge news with it, the comic.
5108260	5108500	Yeah.
5108500	5108740	Yeah.
5108740	5115380	The huge news with it is that they got the entire original movie cast to reprise their
5115380	5122580	roles, which when you consider a lot of them were like pre A-listers like Brie Larson,
5123700	5126100	you know, that like you've got a lot of people that are really big.
5126100	5130500	Or what's her name that played Kim that was in Picard as the new board queen?
5131460	5133380	Oh, that was her.
5135140	5137060	Oh, that's, oh, that's wild.
5137060	5137220	Yeah.
5137220	5140100	But there's like all these people that are, you know, huge.
5140820	5143060	They're all, and one of the Chris's is in it.
5143060	5145700	Oh yeah.
5145700	5147220	And Chris Evans was in it.
5147220	5147780	Chris Evans.
5147780	5152340	They're all re, all coming back and doing their voices, which is great.
5152340	5155700	And what's his name that played Todd Ingram was also a big name.
5155700	5156180	Hold on.
5158100	5158980	Actor.
5158980	5160180	I know who he is.
5160180	5160580	Hold on.
5162020	5163060	Brandon Routh, right?
5163780	5164180	Yeah.
5164180	5164680	Yeah.
5165300	5166180	Cause he was Superman.
5167140	5167380	Yeah.
5167380	5171460	His, his, unfortunately I would say his star was probably larger when that movie came out
5171460	5172180	than it is now.
5172180	5173140	No, no shade on him.
5173140	5176820	It's just, you know, Superman was, was not that long before Scott Pilgrim.
5176820	5181140	So, um, but yeah, but it's, it's pretty, pretty wild that they got everybody Anna
5181140	5185940	Kendrick's in there too as Scott's sister and she, you know, then Pitch Perfect happened.
5185940	5186180	Right.
5186180	5187220	So, you know, it's good.
5187220	5188820	It got a lot of big names in there.
5188820	5194180	So, of course there's, there's absolutely my, my favorite character.
5194980	5198900	Um, uh, well, no, that was, yeah, that was, um,
5201140	5201780	that's right.
5202340	5203140	Julie powers.
5204340	5207700	I was going to say Aubrey Plaza was in that game or in that movie.
5207700	5211220	I forgot, God, it was all these good people that were in there.
5211220	5215540	So yeah, uh, Shane and chat wondering, I wonder who the other characters that they
5215540	5217380	cut from the movie will be played by.
5217380	5223700	I feel like nobody, nobody a-list because they've blown all the budget on that.
5223700	5229700	Um, no, it'll be fucking, um, why can't I, why can't I do names today?
5231540	5232820	Mario, Star Lord.
5235140	5235540	That's it.
5235540	5237300	Chris, why can't I do names today?
5237300	5238180	Let's not.
5238180	5241860	I know, I know, but I'm just, I'm being very tongue in cheek when I say that.
5242420	5242920	All right.
5244500	5245220	Moving on.
5245220	5247380	Let's go to our next story.
5247380	5247880	Loki.
5248740	5252500	It'll just have Macaulay Culkin do it since his brother's in there.
5252500	5253380	I'd be okay with that.
5254660	5255940	He's, he's too for a renaissance.
5255940	5257380	Wait, have him, have him play who?
5258020	5258500	I don't know.
5258500	5258820	Anybody.
5258820	5259620	One of the cut characters.
5261460	5261940	I don't care.
5261940	5263300	You can play a convenience store.
5264580	5268660	He can play the guy that, um, uh, Steven Stills hooks up with.
5269300	5271060	The recording studio guy.
5271060	5275700	Um, to respond to this comment in chat as 200 Matt says, Rob needs coffee.
5276420	5276980	Yes.
5276980	5281540	I didn't have a coffee for the show tonight and I probably should have, I was actually
5281540	5282500	just personal story.
5282500	5285780	So I have the problem that dark soccer I had last week.
5286340	5289540	And that is that I went to San Francisco yesterday.
5289540	5294260	I actually went so far as to stay the night because I went to Rocky horror picture show
5294260	5299540	to see the lovely Aria snark take on the role of Frank and further in Rocky horror.
5300100	5301620	I didn't even make it through the whole movie.
5302260	5305620	I didn't even, I didn't even, I didn't even make it through the whole movie.
5305620	5307780	I went and I say, I stayed in a hotel last night.
5307780	5309300	I didn't get to bed till like 2 AM.
5310020	5313060	Uh, and then yeah, I got up early and came home.
5313060	5315860	So yes, I'm, I'm running on fee and there may have been drinking involved.
5315860	5320100	So as there sometimes is at the Rocky horror picture show and why I stayed in a hotel.
5321140	5325060	I'm live one salty survivor tears, AKA Kona coffee.
5325060	5325300	Yeah.
5326100	5327540	Get that product placement in.
5327540	5327860	All right.
5329700	5330340	All right.
5330340	5331140	Moving on Loki.
5331140	5331640	I'm sorry.
5332580	5338900	Uh, so yeah, we have a, well, hopefully not life ruining a lawsuit like with Nintendo,
5338900	5345460	but you may remember a while back bungee was suing folks that were creating cheats for
5345460	5346420	destiny too.
5347060	5354820	And, uh, the cheat software, I guess being sold by veteran cheats was basically a target
5354820	5355300	of that.
5355300	5360820	And so now they have finished that court case and have won $12 million from the suit.
5361620	5368660	And of course, uh, with that, they said that bungee is taking 12 meal, $12,059,912 and
5368660	5377380	98 cents and total damages with, they said, uh, 11,696,000 going towards violations of
5377380	5384100	the DMCA and the other 146,000 plus for violations of the copyright act.
5384100	5388340	And then 217,000 accounting for the studio's attorney expenses.
5388980	5393940	And he said, uh, after subpoenaing the Stripe, uh, which is a payment service, obviously
5394820	5401380	bungee learned that at least 50 or 5,848 separate transactions took place through the service.
5401380	5401880	Wow.
5403940	5406420	So this is way more than I actually expected.
5406420	5408340	That's that's, that's a lot of cheating.
5409300	5416820	Um, I'm not sure who, if it's just like one seller, it's against the seller, um, Mihai
5417780	5419460	Fadou Florentine.
5420260	5423940	So it may be an individual, but hopefully it's not like the Nintendo thing where they
5423940	5428660	basically bankrupt that guy for life type of thing over like video game cheating.
5428660	5431780	Um, we'll see, I guess.
5432500	5433000	Yeah.
5433140	5434580	I mean, yeah.
5434580	5435860	I mean, I don't, I don't know.
5435860	5439940	Is he, was the person in America or are they in another country?
5439940	5440440	I missed that.
5440440	5442900	I think they're in another, they're Romanian.
5442900	5444100	So then I can't answer that.
5444100	5447780	If it was America, they could do that same, the garnishment of the salary and all that
5447780	5449380	stuff to, to do the judgment.
5449380	5450420	They could do all that.
5450420	5455700	So, um, but I don't know how that money, no, but I'm just to answer the question, can they
5455700	5456900	bankrupt the individual?
5456900	5459620	I don't know how it works because he's Romanian and non-American.
5460260	5461780	So, yeah.
5461780	5463460	I know that the galleys are going to be funky.
5464260	5467940	Uh, by the way, I will take Shayla's offer in our chat over twitchy slash vog network
5467940	5469780	saying I can teleport and deliver coffee.
5470340	5472260	Done taken, come on over.
5473460	5475620	Me casa su casa, especially if you have coffee.
5476740	5478740	Shayla's got some magical powers.
5478740	5484020	I think that one would just be another one on the list other than being, you know, chaos
5484020	5486580	personified and the killer tamer.
5488020	5488520	All right.
5489140	5492740	Well, moving on, let's talk about a classic game.
5493300	5498100	Game that I don't think a lot of people were pirating or, um, you know, asking for to come
5498100	5499380	back, but I don't know.
5499380	5501220	These games have their fans, that's for sure.
5501220	5505140	And that is the Jurassic park retro collection.
5505140	5508820	Now here's before you get too excited, let me explain this.
5508820	5516420	So limited run games, uh, is doing a collection of classic Jurassic park titles.
5516420	5519060	It's the 30th anniversary retro collection.
5519940	5523700	Only the titles developed by ocean are in this collection.
5524420	5527540	So the super Nintendo version, which here's the thing.
5528100	5531940	There wasn't the thing about the super Nintendo Jurassic park.
5531940	5537460	It came from an era when like 3d games were just being born.
5537460	5542420	It was that Wolfenstein original doom era of PC games.
5542980	5547540	And they figured out how to do that on the super Nintendo, which let's be real, wasn't
5547620	5548120	easy.
5548820	5554500	It was some serious sprite manipulation and that whole thing to make like a fake 3d type
5554500	5555140	of thing work.
5555780	5559860	So when they implemented that in Jurassic park, even though, and the trick was you were
5559860	5561620	looking through goggles.
5561620	5566260	So that way this on the screen, it was just like, like a quarter of the size of the screen
5566260	5567140	in a goggle shape.
5567700	5572100	And if you weren't born during the Wolfenstein era, that's how we got, how we got better
5572100	5572660	performances.
5572660	5576260	You'd shrink the screen down to like, you know, a post it.
5576260	5576820	Yep.
5576820	5577320	Yep.
5577700	5581380	So, and yeah, the, the chat is exploding going, God damn it.
5581380	5582500	30 years.
5582500	5582980	Yeah.
5582980	5584420	That, that first movie.
5585860	5587300	Was it 93 that it came out?
5587300	5588260	I thought it was 94.
5588260	5591300	I thought it was like my sophomore year of high school, but yeah, that first movie is
5592020	5592340	old.
5592340	5597220	I thought it came out when I graduated, but I had read the book before that.
5597220	5599220	So I might be getting that confused.
5599220	5599860	Yeah.
5599860	5600980	I thought it was out longer.
5600980	5605940	The only thing I remember really of the book was that, um, Malcolm always wore black and
5605940	5606260	gray.
5606260	5607540	So all of his clothes would match.
5609860	5615620	Also in this was, uh, the NES games, which were in the Game Boy games, which were, you
5615620	5619540	know, yeah, there was, there was a, it was 93.
5619540	5620020	Wow.
5620020	5620520	Okay.
5621220	5621460	All right.
5621460	5625140	Well, hence you remember there being an NES for hence 30 years.
5625140	5625380	Yeah.
5625380	5628580	Uh, it might, it might've only been in Europe.
5630020	5632740	Cause Ocean was, uh, based in Europe.
5632740	5633780	If I remember right.
5633780	5635860	I, I would have to research that a little bit.
5635860	5638180	I don't remember playing the NES one, but I do.
5638180	5642260	I definitely remember playing the SNES one, but the, my point is because it's only the
5642260	5643940	Ocean games, guess what's missing?
5644980	5650900	Sega's ports, which were done by a different, which many people would say the, the Sega
5650900	5656340	CD Jurassic Park was like the best one, but the one where you played as the dinosaur,
5656980	5658020	that was the fun one.
5658740	5659700	And the Genesis one.
5659700	5660020	Yeah.
5660020	5660900	It's the Genesis one.
5660900	5661400	Yeah.
5662260	5665220	I would be down for a revival of being a dinosaur.
5665220	5665780	Yeah.
5665780	5670580	And that was actually, you know, for that era was a really was like the, the unique
5670580	5676740	twist that that was that now you play the villain quote unquote, that was actually a
5676740	5677540	pretty rad twist.
5677540	5682900	And I think why that game was, even if the super Nintendo one might've actually actually
5682900	5684580	been technically better.
5684580	5689380	The Genesis one was more fun because you get to do either way.
5689380	5692420	The dinosaurs couldn't be called a villain, just an antagonist.
5692420	5694740	Cause they were just trying to, you know, get a meal.
5695380	5697060	You know, get out of the cage.
5697060	5699060	Just, just do dinosaur things.
5699060	5699380	Okay.
5699380	5703780	And I'm, my, my memory is warping because Matt is correct in me saying it was only the
5703780	5704340	Genesis one.
5704340	5709460	The Sega CD one was a point and click adventure game, which I, yeah, I remember.
5709460	5710580	I thought I have it.
5711220	5714260	I thought the CD version was just an amped up one of the Genesis.
5714260	5718020	I thought that was a thing at some point, but I, was there a 32 X version?
5719220	5722420	I don't think there was a 30 X one.
5723540	5724040	Okay.
5725060	5729940	Um, why am I thinking, I'm thinking of like a souped up Sega Genesis version for some
5729940	5732260	reason, but maybe my brain just made it up.
5733140	5736340	Actually, yes, there was a 32 X one, I believe.
5736980	5738660	Um, hold on, I'm going to double check.
5738660	5745460	Um, because it's saying that there was one for all three, but I don't recall the 32 X
5745460	5745960	version.
5746500	5753700	I just remember, um, that the, the Sega, I mean, maybe it was like an enhanced on 32
5753700	5753940	X.
5753940	5762100	Yeah, but, but, um, but no, it was as far as I was aware, the highest level it came
5762100	5765700	out of that era of games was going to be on the Sega CD.
5765700	5767780	And I do have that one and it's terrible.
5767780	5768180	All right.
5768180	5772500	Well, then my bad for the way I phrased that earlier, I must've been thinking of 32 X or
5772500	5773860	something, but it doesn't matter.
5773860	5774340	Do you know what?
5774340	5776020	None of those games are in the collection.
5776020	5782020	So it's, uh, it's, uh, only the Nintendo based ones, because again, for whatever reason,
5782020	5783700	they were licensed to different companies.
5783700	5790660	Ocean had the Nintendo rights and was it Sega themselves with the other, or did a third
5790660	5791460	party do that for them?
5791460	5793060	I do it for classic game.
5793060	5793460	All right.
5794180	5795380	I'll wait with bated breath.
5795380	5799780	Meanwhile, since you, since you brought up classic game, dark Sakura.
5801460	5803540	Well, you remember, I sent you, um,
5803540	5814580	I'm playing the button and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive
5814580	5818420	into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5818420	5821060	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5822260	5824100	And what did you pick for us tonight?
5824100	5826660	Dark Sakura Catherine.
5826660	5836100	And also I actually sent you of, of AI Jamie introducing the classic game of the week.
5836100	5838180	Do you think I've had time before the show to get that?
5839060	5843140	Probably not, but I thought it's so weird sounding.
5843140	5847460	It's, it's the same tone I hear in my head, you know, that I don't hear out loud, but,
5847460	5849060	but anyway, back to the game.
5849060	5854420	So I picked Catherine, which, um, it came out for, uh, the PlayStation three and Xbox
5854420	5860980	three 60 in Japan and North America in 2011, the PAL versions came out in 2012.
5860980	5867220	The windows version by Sega came out in 2019, but the game was developed by Atlas.
5868020	5876420	Um, also just as a side, I, um, I read the book, there's a book of it and I have a translation
5876420	5876920	of it.
5878020	5881140	So, um, it's, it's quite, uh, quite interesting.
5881140	5884180	The path that the book takes, it's, it's very different perspectives.
5884900	5893460	Um, but, uh, the game follows a man named Vincent Brooks, who has weird supernatural
5893460	5901380	nightmares and he is having a romantic crisis with his girlfriend, Catherine with a K and
5901380	5905060	another, uh, girl named Catherine with a C.
5905940	5912820	Um, and so it's divided between daytime where you have like a social SIM and then his dreams
5912820	5916420	where you go through these 3d puzzle towers.
5916420	5921780	So it's a combination of platforming and puzzle solving, and the game is affected by the choices
5921780	5923460	Vincent makes over the story.
5924180	5932420	Um, and actually it has a little bit, uh, in common with, uh, it's actually the same
5932420	5939300	studio behind the persona series, including, uh, the director and producer, um, Hashino
5939300	5939860	Katsura.
5940500	5945540	Um, the character designer is the same and the music composer is the same.
5945540	5952420	That's, uh, Meguro Shoji and, uh, for the character designer, uh, Soijima Shigenori.
5952420	5959300	Um, but the game started at the end of Persona 4's development in 2008, and they wanted
5959300	5961540	to do something for a more adult audience.
5961540	5969380	Um, uh, English localization was handled by Atlas USA and then, um, the, uh, update for
5969380	5975460	full body was, uh, developed by Studio Zero, which is a newly formed division within Atlas
5975460	5976580	that was led by Hashino.
5977220	5983700	Um, but they wanted to expand on the original to bring back the cast and adding a new love
5983700	5988340	interest named Rin, short for Catherine with a Q.
5988660	5993060	Um, so going back though to the game is cross genre.
5993060	5997860	So you are Vincent, you have your daytime social sim, where you have to interact with
5997860	6000340	different characters and make different decisions as you go.
6001300	6008260	Um, and then you do your puzzle solving in the, uh, the puzzle, the, in the platform
6008260	6009220	puzzle mode.
6009220	6012900	So you have, um, three modes for that.
6012900	6016980	There's in the single player story, uh, it's dubbed golden playhouse.
6016980	6022420	And there's a multiplayer exclusive Coliseum challenge that is unlocked after completing
6022420	6022920	the story.
6023700	6030180	So in the daytime, Vincent interacts with the ladies and, uh, different characters at
6030180	6034820	the stray sheep bar, and then he can choose different options to respond.
6034820	6039380	Um, and these are in standard dialogue as well as in text messages.
6040020	6044980	So, um, he can also purchase drinks that help his navigation of the nightmare.
6044980	6047620	Um, but they also can impede his movement.
6047620	6053620	If he has too many, there's a mini game called Rapunzel, which mimics the game play in nightmares.
6053620	6058420	Um, or listen to a jukebox with different tracks from other Atlas games.
6058420	6063220	When you leave the stray sheep, it triggers, uh, the next nightmare section.
6064020	6069460	Um, and so you have to climb these blocks, which have to be arranged into a stairway
6069460	6070660	to reach the exit.
6070660	6077060	As you climb, the tower collapses underneath him, and he needs to arrange the blocks before
6077060	6080180	the collapse comes or he will fall and the game ends.
6080180	6086020	Uh, you'll restart from your last checkpoint on the tower if you have a pillow, um, or
6086020	6088180	you have to restart the game from the last scene.
6088820	6095620	Also funny enough, um, Vincent has, uh, ram horns in that mode.
6095860	6097780	Um, it's, it's actually very cool.
6097780	6103860	There's a lot of references to sheep and, and, you know, the sheep-like animals.
6103860	6112100	Um, because I don't really, I know that there was like some sort of, uh, symbolism behind
6112100	6112600	it.
6112600	6117940	Um, but at any rate, um, you, after you complete a stage, you have a score, depending on the
6117940	6123620	time completed and the items that you collected and they're posted on online links, um, and
6123620	6128100	posted on online leaderboards access, access through the game start menu.
6128740	6134100	Um, you can also get like different types of, uh, items in there, which you can purchase
6134100	6138980	them between games or find them in the levels like spare blocks, uh, lightning blocks that
6138980	6143140	remove enemies, energy drinks that let you to climb more steps at a time.
6143780	6148580	Now in the full body release, there was a new mode that had rearranged versions of the
6148580	6155700	puzzles, um, with the games arrangement being a sec, a separate mode.
6155700	6160980	There's a new online multiplayer added where you can enter, uh, both randomized matches
6160980	6163300	or a contest with a player of equal rank.
6164020	6168500	Um, then there's Rin who can be called to halt the towers collapse for a short time.
6169860	6175300	Uh, you can also access a new difficulty level called, uh, safety, which removes all the
6175300	6176660	threats and time limits.
6176660	6180020	And it just lets you skip the puzzles and play the story.
6180740	6187140	Um, the major characters in this game are of course, Vincent Brooks, a 32 year old systems
6187140	6189620	engineer, who's the protagonist.
6189620	6191940	He's just that tippler bachelor.
6192740	6194740	He was voiced by Troy Baker in English.
6195540	6202100	Then there's Catherine with C the 22 year old woman who meets Vincent at the stray sheep
6202100	6203780	and ends up spending the night with him.
6204500	6209540	And, uh, she continues to try to romance Vincent and she's weird.
6210180	6218500	She seems outwardly playful, seductive, but in reality, spoiler alert, she's a succubus.
6220820	6226260	Then you have Catherine with a K a 32 year old, uh, office manager, uh, working for a
6226260	6227860	clothes manufacturer.
6227860	6229460	She went to high school with Vincent.
6229460	6233540	They reconnected and were dating and she wants to marry him.
6233540	6236580	But he's, she's irritated by how indecisive he is.
6237300	6243780	Um, and then, and of course full body, there's being short for Catherine, who is an amnesiac
6243780	6249380	who plays piano at the stray sheep and she becomes a comfort to Vincent.
6249380	6255620	Um, and then of course you have his regular drinking buddies, Orlando, who I think Orlando
6255620	6256740	is absolutely hilarious.
6257540	6260740	Um, he's an old friend and divorcee.
6260740	6262260	He's very cynical.
6262260	6270100	Uh, Johnny, um, Arika, who is an, uh, idealist looking for a soulmate and Toby Nebbins, who
6270100	6272100	is, uh, Johnny's coworker.
6272100	6276820	And he has a thing for Erica Anderson, who is a waitress at the stray sheep.
6276820	6278340	There's Thomas mutton.
6278340	6279460	Who's nicknamed boss.
6279460	6280660	He's the owner.
6280660	6286660	And it's narrated by Trisha, who is the host of the golden playhouse dubbed the midnight
6286660	6287620	Venus.
6287620	6290340	And so I'm not going to go too much more into it.
6290340	6295940	It's, you know, is a pretty, pretty story intensive game.
6296740	6302100	Um, although, uh, Trisha states in the game that the tower is a metaphor for the journey
6302100	6306020	to adulthood and that there's no right way to climb the tower.
6306020	6311300	She talks directly to you and she eventually realizes that she is the goddess Ishtar.
6312340	6316260	So, um, but yeah, there's, there's more through it.
6316260	6318820	I'm not going to go too much deeper.
6318820	6324500	They actually had almost considered making this a game for handheld or mobile devices,
6324500	6328740	but, um, they ended up going with how they did.
6328740	6335860	Um, it was not planned for local for a us release or Western release right away.
6335860	6340660	But after a leak, uh, through EB games and GameStop Atlas USA confirmed that they were
6340660	6341300	releasing it.
6341940	6345220	Um, and it was localized, uh, by Atlas USA.
6345220	6348340	Like I just said, who handled a lot of the companies earlier titles.
6348980	6354020	Um, and the game took off.
6354020	6356020	I mean, it really took off.
6356820	6364260	Um, and there were a bunch of the quotes that were used in the loading screens that were
6364260	6368340	all famous quotes from a Japanese book of quotes.
6368340	6376500	Um, and so, uh, they ended up having to use new quotes, um, instead of identifying and
6376500	6379620	translating the existing ones, cause they didn't quote the original people.
6379620	6383300	So they quoted Douglas Adams, George Carlin, Rodney Dangerfield.
6383940	6393380	Um, and then, um, they were trying to do mainstream, uh, uh, promotion like target Walmart, but
6393380	6399620	they were really behind, not behind it because of it being a quote adult title, but, um,
6399620	6405620	they did a film reel of, uh, you know, AAA games that had more explicit content.
6405620	6407940	And so like, these are worse than us.
6407940	6409940	Let us be in your, in your little club.
6409940	6410500	So it happened.
6411220	6420660	Um, as for, um, you know, going back to the, the full body is it was released after persona
6420660	6422980	five, it was made with some of the persona staff.
6423540	6426580	And it was considered the definitive version of Catherine.
6426580	6434020	Um, which I know it's, it's closer than the 10 year limit, but it's going back into, it
6434020	6436580	had downloadable content, all kinds of stuff.
6436580	6438580	And you could play as Joker from persona five.
6439380	6442500	Um, but they're there.
6442500	6446420	They really wanted to focus on diversity, uh, diversity within the narrative and the
6446420	6447300	gameplay.
6447300	6452180	They want it to be something different, something that people haven't seen anything much like
6452180	6452660	anymore.
6453220	6455700	Um, yeah, the music was great.
6455700	6458420	Uh, it received very positive reviews.
6458420	6467540	Um, according to Metacritic, um, the game was considered, uh, Difficult due to the random
6467540	6475300	enemy AI by some sites, but for the most part, the ratings were in the 80% plus range.
6475940	6479380	Um, but yeah, it sold pretty well.
6479940	6487620	Um, it can actually, even the Xbox version sold, like it came in at seventh place at
6487620	6491780	the only, uh, the game it outsold actually was Marvel versus Capcom three.
6492740	6494980	So that's pretty interesting.
6494980	6498660	Um, but yeah, there's a PC port of the original game.
6498660	6502420	It was considered one of the best selling new releases on steam in 2017.
6503220	6509300	Um, and the, the full body version reached second place in the sales charts.
6509300	6511540	Um, after it was released, there's a Vita version.
6512260	6520500	Um, it it's definitely, and it even won, um, uh, it was, uh, uh, nominated for an Annie
6520500	6523940	award, which, uh, for best animated video game.
6523940	6529700	And it was, uh, uh, also nominated for some of the navigator awards and actually won,
6529780	6535780	uh, two when Michelle rough as Catherine with K, uh, for best support, uh, best supporting
6535780	6539460	performer and writing in a drama was the other category.
6539460	6540820	And so that's it, Catherine.
6541460	6546420	Also, if anyone wants to read the translated book, let me know.
6546420	6549860	It is a very interesting read, but a very straightforward translation.
6551220	6551940	All right.
6551940	6552420	Interesting.
6552420	6555220	Uh, the choice, I don't, I don't know this game very well.
6555220	6559540	Obviously you explain it very well there in that segment, but, um, I, and I knew of the
6559540	6562820	game when it first came out, but, um, I never really played it at all.
6562820	6564340	So it just never was on my radar.
6564340	6571380	So I would say watch like some partial playthroughs, like watch the, the tower scenes
6571380	6573460	and maybe a scene here and there.
6573460	6573620	Yeah.
6573620	6576020	I was watching the, watching the B roll as you were talking about it.
6576020	6579140	I liked some of the things where it was like using that whole, like, we're going to pull
6579140	6580740	the internet on these same questions.
6580740	6581780	We're asking you now.
6581780	6586020	And the, the, you see that in telltale games, sometimes that whole thing is interesting.
6586020	6586260	Yeah.
6586260	6588900	So I think it's an absolutely fascinating game.
6588900	6592500	I had trouble with the tower scenes just because of my wrists at the time.
6593220	6598820	Um, but it's, it's absolutely worth revisiting and, and, you know, you can get it on steam.
6598820	6599320	All right.
6600180	6600740	All right.
6600740	6605140	Well, we've got some more stories coming up, but first, uh, some quick, some quick hits
6605140	6606580	in rapid fire news.
6606580	6607080	Loki.
6608180	6608820	Yes.
6608820	6610660	So more TV talk.
6610660	6618820	Um, it was just teased that a Twisted Metal TV series is coming to Peacock in July.
6619540	6623300	That I just noticed that there's a teaser trailer for it too.
6625540	6631860	Now it has Anthony Mackie in it who I like because he's, you know, when he's the new
6631860	6632900	captain America.
6632900	6641940	Um, but I'm hesitant that this will be good, but I'll watch it.
6643300	6646020	Um, it's also going to have, oh, actually it has some decent people.
6646020	6650340	So it says along with that, it's going to have, uh, Stephanie Beatrice, who's in Brooklyn
6650340	6653220	nine nine, Thomas Hayden church, who was in Spiderman.
6653780	6656820	Um, Neve Campbell also in there as well.
6656820	6660340	And will Arnett is going to be doing the voice of sweet tooth.
6663300	6664100	All right.
6664100	6664980	I hope it's good.
6664980	6667140	I probably won't watch it, but that's fine.
6667140	6668420	I do love Neve Campbell though.
6668420	6669300	So never say never.
6669940	6670440	Yeah.
6670680	6678920	Um, also we got some more look at the new donkey Kong sets that are coming from Lego
6678920	6679640	in August.
6680200	6686120	And, um, so they have a whole bunch of, well, they're, they're teasing the different family
6686120	6687000	members in there as well.
6687000	6691560	So we got, you know, Craigie Kong, funky calling and duty calling in there as well as donkey
6691560	6691800	calling.
6691800	6693240	And I, I saw him somewhere else.
6693240	6695720	Oh, and, um, what was it?
6695720	6696920	Daisy Kong as well.
6697480	6701000	I know somewhere else though, I actually saw what the sets looked like.
6701560	6707720	Um, it's probably on one of the Lego blogs that I read occasionally, but, um, they look
6707720	6709800	pretty cool from what I remember.
6709800	6716440	Um, they've got, I remember like the donkey Kong set has like his tree house and everything.
6716440	6720680	Um, they even have like bongos and stuff like that.
6721800	6723400	It'll, it'll be interesting.
6723400	6725880	I don't really understand how that's going to play out yet.
6725960	6731160	Like I stopped, we stopped collecting the Mario sets because like the whole game behind
6731160	6732200	it is really boring.
6733560	6738760	You're supposed to just like set up this like large stage and just like hop your character
6738760	6739720	around the game points.
6739720	6741000	And it's really dumb.
6741000	6743960	Um, it's all just to sell more Legos.
6743960	6748600	It is, but they're not like good display sets either, which is kind of unfortunate because
6748600	6749640	it's more based around the game.
6749640	6754280	Like if it was just display stuff, like, like the Sonic the Hedgehog things, for example,
6754280	6756200	like now those are actual sets.
6756200	6757320	Like that's cool.
6757320	6762440	Um, but like if it's just, I wish they would do that with the Mario stuff as well.
6762440	6766680	And Donkey Kong where it's like actual like sets and not just like, okay, let's play this
6766680	6770440	game because like they have so many expansions for it now.
6770440	6773400	Like if you were to set it all up, like there's no room to do it.
6773400	6774680	It's just too big.
6774680	6777000	And, and the gameplay itself is not fun.
6777000	6779480	And, and they also don't include manuals with any of it.
6779480	6782200	You have to use an app, which is not optimized.
6782200	6783240	So it drains your phone.
6783240	6784520	So that's also fun.
6784520	6791560	Um, it's just a pain to build stuff because it's through the app, but, um, yeah, I'll
6791560	6794360	look forward to looking at them, you know, in the store shelves.
6794360	6795560	Cause that's what I do nowadays.
6795560	6796840	I'm like, Oh, cool.
6796840	6797080	Yeah.
6797080	6798040	Wish I could afford that.
6800200	6800700	Kinda.
6801320	6801800	All right.
6801800	6803000	Uh, dark soccer.
6804520	6811640	So, um, the, uh, PlayStation plus games for May are looking pretty interesting.
6812200	6817160	It looks like there's going to be grid legends, which is a racing game with the story.
6817720	6824840	Um, and then, uh, there's also descenders where you are, it's a, it's a bike racing
6824840	6825340	game.
6825880	6832200	Um, and then there's also a chivalry too, where it's night on night action.
6832200	6832700	Bonk.
6835640	6836140	All right.
6836920	6841240	Um, well it's, uh, only humanity is going to be in there too.
6841240	6841740	Yeah.
6842600	6845880	Uh, it's a little, Oh, I'm glad they're going to do that one after all.
6845880	6849480	That's, uh, um, enhances latest game.
6849480	6852440	I, there was rumors that was going to end up being a PlayStation plus titles.
6852440	6853080	That's pretty cool.
6853080	6854040	I'll have to check that out.
6854760	6855260	Okay.
6855800	6857800	Um, let's talk about this game.
6857800	6861480	Cause this is only a little over a month away from release and that's Diablo four,
6861480	6863480	believe it or not finally happening.
6863480	6865640	Uh, they added a new beta weekend.
6865640	6867320	I think we talked about that previously.
6867320	6870440	It's going to be, they're calling it the server slam weekend.
6870440	6875240	But in the server slam weekend, you're going to get some more tweaked kind of
6875240	6876200	graphic settings.
6876200	6879080	They're calling these the final PC system requirements.
6880120	6884600	And they're basing this off data from the early access and open beta weekends to try
6884600	6889240	to kind of give, you know, push you into whichever, uh, graphic settings would be
6889240	6890760	the best for you.
6890760	6892920	I'm not going to, I mean, this has been a lot for me to read.
6892920	6897000	So just at a high level, I'll mention the minimum specifications.
6897080	6904280	You'll have to have at least an Intel I five 2,500 or an AMD FX 80, three 50, eight gigs
6904280	6905320	of Ram minimum.
6905320	6910040	And you have to have at least an Nvidia G force GTX six 60 or an AMD radio on our nine
6910040	6910760	two 80.
6910760	6911080	Okay.
6911080	6916280	That's the minimum maximum you want to play this ultra four K 60 frames a second.
6916280	6924760	You're going to need an Intel I seven 8,700 or an AMD Ryzen seven 2,700 32 gigs of Ram
6925480	6931720	and either an Nvidia G force RTX 30 80 G force RTX 40 series.
6931720	6939400	If you want DLSS three or at AMD Radeon RX 6,800, no matter which version you take,
6940120	6942040	you're going to need 90 gigabytes of space.
6942840	6945480	That's what you're going to need for all of the versions.
6945480	6951000	So, uh, Blizzard did say Diablo four will still attempt to run, even if you have below
6951080	6955800	the minimum specifications, but the game experience may be diminished.
6955800	6958040	So at least it's not as bad as Star Wars.
6958040	6962920	Was it with 150 gigabyte install and 128 gigabyte patch?
6962920	6963560	Yeah.
6963560	6967400	So, well, we don't know what the patch is going to look like for Diablo, but, uh, I
6967400	6969560	imagine it's probably going to have a pretty big patch as well.
6969560	6974120	So, um, and Questbuster does point out there are some freebies you can carry into the main
6974120	6976760	game in this beta, like a title and some cosmetics.
6976760	6977160	Yes.
6977160	6981800	And if you didn't get the stuff the first time you can get it this time and they added
6981800	6983800	a new one to try to get people to play again.
6984600	6988680	There's something from beating the world boss, uh, that you can carry in the main game.
6988680	6991400	And I forget what it is in the moment, but it's, it's another cosmetic.
6991400	6996920	So, all right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
6996920	6999560	We'll start with the U S and what's coming to store shelves this week.
7000280	7005000	Not a lot this week, but we've got age of wonders four on PC PlayStation five and Xbox
7005000	7015800	series, red fall on PC and Xbox series, uh, Raven Oak on the PC, uh, Xbox one and Xbox
7015800	7016200	series.
7016920	7022680	Um, I guess let's wave Raven lock my mistake, uh, death or treat.
7022680	7028760	I love that name on PC PlayStation five and Xbox series Hogwarts legacy coming to PlayStation
7028760	7030120	four and Xbox one.
7030120	7031080	And that's it.
7032520	7033000	All right.
7033000	7035640	Well, traveling to Japan and checking out the releases there.
7035640	7041320	If you might, you might recall last week, I said it is that it is finally that week.
7041320	7043000	Are there any new games this week?
7043000	7045560	Not really why it's golden week in Japan.
7046280	7051240	So, uh, there really isn't anything coming out, but I will point out that there is actually
7051240	7053480	one release randomly on the PlayStation five.
7053480	7059240	I'm not sure why it's happening right now, but it is a game called TT Isle of man ride
7059240	7062760	on the edge three that it's a, it's a motocross type of game.
7062760	7064840	It's a motorbike simulator racer game.
7064840	7068760	That's the one game that is daring to release this week on the fifth.
7068760	7069640	Um, but that is it.
7069640	7074440	Otherwise that's probably, probably why, uh, you're seeing a pretty dry calendar and
7074440	7075720	other region regions too.
7075720	7080280	I will take this opportunity to remind that because it is golden week in Japan, a lot
7080280	7082200	of places are having sales like dark soccer.
7082200	7086440	You pointed out in chat steam is actually selling Catherine tonight's classic game
7086440	7090280	selection for five bucks as a tie into a golden week sale.
7090280	7095240	I haven't seen a similar sale on PlayStation's front yet, but one might be coming this week
7095240	7098920	because technically I think it starts started yesterday or today.
7098920	7105480	There's it's company wide for, um, for Sega and also Capcom sent out an email, um, that
7105480	7110040	some of their games, both physical and digital are also on various sales.
7110760	7116120	Um, but, uh, like I actually, even though I already have the PS four version, I picked
7116120	7123320	up a PPO Tetris for five bucks and, and then the sequel for, I think six.
7123320	7123820	Yeah.
7124680	7128120	So, I mean, there's some pretty good sales on there for games.
7128120	7133160	Like the whole Etrian Odyssey collection is like 80 bucks for the whole thing.
7133160	7133660	Wow.
7134360	7137480	Valkyria Chronicle collection is like 15.
7137480	7137980	Yeah.
7138600	7142040	So yeah, so there was some pretty good stuff on there and devolver is also having a sale
7142040	7143240	just putting that out.
7143240	7146120	So if you want cult of the lamb, it's 16 bucks right now.
7146120	7148600	And there is a bunch of new stuff that just came out for it.
7148600	7149480	If you have the DLC.
7150040	7150540	Nice.
7150920	7153800	And as I mentioned earlier in the show, I don't think it has anything to do a golden
7153800	7157800	week and I don't even know if this deal is still available, but I did pick up stranger
7157800	7160040	paradise final fantasy origin for 20 bucks.
7160040	7161960	It finally hit that sweet spot for me.
7161960	7164840	Um, it was, it's only certain sites.
7164840	7168520	So Amazon target and Walmart all have it for 20 bucks.
7168520	7171000	Best buy for whatever reason didn't, I don't know why.
7171960	7176600	And then Amazon was sold out of the PS five version, but public service announcement.
7176600	7181480	If you really want the PS five version, the PS four version has a completely free upgrade.
7181480	7184840	You just have to have the disc in the drive when you play it, which whatever you'd have
7184840	7186600	to do that with a PS five version anyway.
7186600	7188840	So it works all the same as far as I'm concerned.
7188840	7192840	So, uh, that I will definitely be streaming that probably Tuesday.
7192840	7197320	I think Monday I'm going to do a theater of them stream again because I'm the deals.
7197320	7201800	I never did a stream of the DLC because I was so focused on final fantasy pixel remaster
7201800	7204200	and something I had a, I had a really big week at my day job.
7204200	7205880	So I'm, I was really focused on that.
7205880	7209480	So we'll get back to the stream this week.
7209480	7211880	We'll do, we'll do as 200 Matt does point out.
7211880	7213400	Best buy should price match.
7213400	7214680	I didn't test that.
7214680	7220360	Um, but I, I, uh, a certain friend of mine that is always influencing me to buy games
7220360	7223480	had suggested the same thing when I was like, well, I don't want to get it cause the PS
7223480	7224920	five version is gone.
7224920	7230200	Um, so, but then I learned the PS four version is essentially the same thing.
7230200	7230600	All right.
7230600	7232920	We almost skipped the UK.
7232920	7233640	I don't want to do that.
7233640	7234280	Dark Sakura.
7235480	7239320	There's only one game I am not going to say the name of because I don't believe it should
7239320	7241720	have any press or anyone should be supporting.
7241720	7245000	Oh, that game on lesser platforms.
7245000	7246120	If I remember calling, right?
7246680	7246920	Yeah.
7246920	7250040	It will be out on May 5th for PlayStation and Xbox.
7250040	7255560	But if I, I, I do not support anyone supporting that.
7255560	7256060	Sorry.
7256920	7258600	Um, actually I'm not sorry.
7258600	7260360	I'm really not sorry at all to say that.
7260360	7261880	I'm sorry that it has to be said.
7262920	7270200	Um, so on May 2nd, red fall is coming out for Xbox on the fifth, a Trek to Yomi is coming
7270200	7271080	out on PlayStation.
7271640	7275320	Um, on the fifth on PlayStation, turn it boy commits tax evasion.
7275320	7277960	I just think that's the best name ever.
7277960	7278600	Yeah, that's pretty good.
7279560	7282440	Yeah, I think I had the game on Stadia.
7283960	7289160	Um, but any, anyway, yeah, it's, it's a, it's a cute RPG type game.
7289160	7291000	Um, but yeah, that's, that's it.
7291000	7294840	I mean, the other stuff coming out of the month is of course, we've got, uh, tears of
7294840	7295480	the kingdom.
7295480	7297880	We have a bubble bobble, every bubble.
7297880	7299560	Try saying that three times fast.
7299560	7300060	I love it.
7300840	7301340	Yeah.
7302520	7307560	Releases are picking up with, uh, when that Zelda game hits boy, we're getting into the
7307560	7308360	summers.
7308360	7309480	Summer is stacked.
7310680	7314440	Stacked puzzle, puzzle, bubble, puzzle, bubble, every bubble.
7315160	7319080	I'm actually, I'm actually pretty happy.
7319080	7324040	It's got, it's the Japanese name puzzle bobble instead of best to move.
7324040	7326120	Cause there's only one bus to move me in my heart.
7326120	7328440	I think at some point they finally did revert.
7328440	7330120	I don't think this is the first game to come out.
7330120	7331080	Not called bus to move.
7331080	7333880	I feel like they did revert that finally at some point.
7334120	7338840	I think it was like the, there was iOS game that was like the puzzle bobble map, weird
7338840	7339800	buy our stuff game.
7340840	7346920	Um, but, but yeah, um, I always thought puzzle bobble was a better name, you know, cause
7346920	7350920	there was only one bus to move and it involves dancing and roller skates for the second one.
7352600	7355960	All right, let's move on and get into some more news.
7355960	7360840	We'll also be taking discord calls later in the show over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
7360840	7363320	That's vognetwork.com slash discord.
7363320	7365960	But even if you're not here live on Sunday night, I would encourage you to head over
7365960	7368120	there throughout the week and chat with us.
7368840	7370360	Let's get into some more stories.
7370360	7370860	Loki.
7371720	7372040	Yeah.
7372040	7380760	So there is more talk about the ROG Ally, which is a kind of steam deck handheld competitor
7381320	7382760	by Asus.
7382760	7385880	And, um, it looks pretty cool.
7385880	7388600	We now know kind of what the price might be.
7388600	7389720	Thanks to a leak.
7389720	7393400	According to the leak, it says that the price is supposed to be $699.
7394600	7397080	Um, it looks cool.
7397080	7400520	Like spec wise, it's supposed to run games better than the steam deck.
7400520	7405720	And I know it's been on different tech, uh, content creator channels and stuff like that.
7405720	7408040	They were like kind of showing off some of the stuff with it.
7408040	7413720	But, um, yeah, I mean, they said, of course that, you know, the leak also says that I
7413720	7418680	can play, um, you know, obviously any of the, uh, streaming platforms.
7418680	7422520	They said, Xbox game, fast G-force now, Google game, steam windows.
7422520	7424280	I mean, of course it's raining windows.
7424280	7425320	So why wouldn't it?
7425880	7432360	Um, I don't remember what, I don't know if we know what the specs were of that yet.
7432360	7442280	Uh, they said it houses an AMD Z1 extreme and a 512 gigabyte NVMe M2 SSD, 16 gigs of,
7442280	7444280	uh, DDR5 RAM.
7444280	7445480	That's not bad.
7446280	7447560	Um, it looks cool.
7448920	7451160	It's also expensive, but it looks cool.
7451160	7451400	Yeah.
7451400	7455960	It's a little pricey, but, um, you know, the handheld element is pretty big deal.
7455960	7456280	Yeah.
7456280	7459880	It sounds like it's going to be, you know, it'll probably run your switch games better
7459880	7460680	than your switch.
7460680	7463640	So, you know, that's the sad thing about it.
7464440	7469240	If you want to play modded, uh, Zelda that, uh, Nintendo doesn't want you to see, uh,
7469240	7471240	this might be the system to do it with.
7471320	7472920	Asus do it, Nintendo don't.
7474280	7474520	All right.
7474520	7477720	Speaking of things Nintendo doesn't want you to see, Dark Sakura.
7479480	7480440	Okay.
7480440	7485960	So, um, you know, and this is actually, I guess, sort of outside of the spirit of the
7485960	7492200	old Giga leak, you know, but, um, they found a Game & Watch Tetris prototype.
7492840	7494280	It's a dual screen.
7494920	7498760	Um, and it, it looks pretty, pretty neat.
7498760	7504440	I mean, the Game & Watch were the LCDs, you know, that just like, like tiger toy style,
7504440	7504760	right?
7504760	7505240	Yeah.
7505240	7511800	Um, you know, monochrome and, um, but this one was actually full on Tetris.
7511800	7515960	Um, it it's in the safe Buster shell.
7515960	7522440	Um, but if it is real, then that means that they were working on the concept of it.
7522440	7528840	I don't, it's coming from a Japanese Twitter post Vectrex 0 9 0 4.
7529720	7534840	Um, but I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if they were going to try to do a Tetris, but
7534840	7536600	I don't know why it would have been a dual screen.
7538200	7538600	Sorry.
7538600	7541640	The sound for the, I was trying to play the video for people and the sound came in.
7541640	7541960	Sorry.
7542840	7548120	Oh, but yeah, let me, let me see what, what this, uh, what this says.
7548760	7550120	Oh, come on.
7550120	7552040	Why are you open Twitter?
7552600	7557880	I was going to be about having it translate the tweet so that I can see what it, what
7557880	7561160	it says is I read like a semi-literate five-year-old.
7562040	7567240	Um, it's the Nintendo Game Watch playthrough of the Phantom Tetris prototype.
7569000	7573000	What's interesting about this, just looking at it is that the well is very different from
7573000	7574280	a typical Tetris game.
7574280	7578920	And then most of all is the whole, like, you can move all of the blocks left and right,
7578920	7585400	which seems kind of, it almost, it looks more like luminous to me, but like, if you
7585400	7588360	could move all of the pieces to the left or the right, I don't know.
7588360	7588920	It's weird.
7590120	7592360	It's, it's, I can see why they didn't go with it.
7592360	7595560	It's, it's too different from, from a regular Tetris, I think.
7597320	7603640	So, uh, there's, uh, there's actually from another post from a hero, Papa, uh, zero,
7603640	7609240	zero, um, it says introducing rare items on the occasion of the release of electronic
7609240	7610920	game machine super guide.
7610920	7615880	This is the prototype of the discontinued game and watch version of Tetris and it's different
7615880	7616920	pictures of it.
7617560	7620120	Um, and different contents.
7620120	7623640	So yeah, it's looking kind of legit.
7625960	7626440	I don't know.
7626440	7632600	Maybe, um, I'll, I'll, what I'll do, and I'm sorry people, but the, um, you know, how Twitter
7632600	7634440	posts are, they have the very long name.
7634440	7642440	I'll post it in our chat here and I'll repost it on my Twitter so that people can see.
7643880	7647080	All right, let's move on.
7647640	7653560	I'm talking about other, uh, items that are making their way to retailers finally, right
7653560	7654120	Loki?
7654120	7660280	I mean, we'll see how, how much to make it to retailers, but apparently the PlayStation
7661240	7664920	VR two is supposed to be hitting retail shelves at some point.
7664920	7665800	I literally forgot.
7666440	7670200	I just want to point out, I literally forgot the PS VR two existed until now.
7671000	7677080	I mean, so it's, it's supposed according to, uh, the UK retailer shop too.
7677080	7683000	They've suggested that it's going to be in stock starting May 12th, allegedly.
7683800	7690040	But to, to that I say, so like, I mean,
7690360	7692680	is it really in that much demand right now?
7692680	7695560	Like, I honestly can't imagine this flying off shelves.
7696840	7697560	I don't know.
7697560	7700600	I, I, yeah, again, what are people buying these for?
7700600	7704920	I don't know, but I mean, PlayStation fives themselves are certainly like, they're, you
7704920	7707000	don't have to try too hard to find those anymore.
7707000	7713320	Yeah, I've seen some in like some of the targets, not the one I normally go to, but I've seen
7713320	7715160	them like occasionally.
7715160	7718520	Um, but yeah, I mean, cool.
7719720	7720360	I don't know.
7720360	7723080	And Shane says, I haven't played mine in forever.
7723080	7725480	And you, you never did even play no man's sky.
7725480	7726440	Did you Shane?
7727080	7737000	Uh, anyway, like I, I do, I would love to try that, that new, um, you know, spiritual
7737000	7743800	successor to, um, the, the game I loved on PlayStation VR, but like me.
7744360	7747800	Oh, um, you're talking about the until dawn Russian blood.
7747800	7748200	Yeah.
7748200	7748440	Yeah.
7748440	7749640	Until dawn Russian blood.
7749640	7750280	Yeah.
7750280	7753800	Like I'd be, I'd be cool to check it out, but like, that's more of like a, I want to
7753800	7754280	check it out.
7754280	7761160	Like at a, one of those, you know, on tour Sony things, like I'll check it out there
7761160	7762760	and like check it out.
7762760	7768680	I'm not going to check it out with a deposit of, you know, thousand dollars, $1,100 to
7768680	7769320	play this thing.
7770760	7772680	No, bring the PC, please.
7773240	7778520	I'll, I'll play it on PC, but I, I'm not paying that kind of money.
7778520	7779080	No, thank you.
7779800	7781560	Uh, Shane does point out switch back.
7781560	7785160	The game you're trying to think of was the game, which was the game I played the most
7785160	7786360	on, on PSVR too.
7786360	7789080	And Bobby says that people are buying it for Gran Turismo seven.
7789080	7791000	I guess I could see that if you're, I could see that.
7791000	7792360	Yeah, I see that.
7792360	7795400	I just don't think it's a lot of people, you know?
7795400	7797160	Yes, there is an audience for it.
7797160	7799160	It's not a gigantic audience or just nothing.
7799160	7801960	That's really like screaming like, Oh my God, I got to get it for this.
7802280	7807960	Switchback VR is cool, but like it, you need more, like the horizon game was even just
7807960	7812760	kind of, it's a nice tech demo, but it's not a great game.
7812760	7816920	Like I need something a little bit more substantial.
7816920	7817160	Yeah.
7817160	7820200	Bobby and Chad says there's no killer app for PSVR too.
7820200	7821240	Yeah, it's, it's, that's it.
7821240	7822680	There's no like killer app.
7822680	7824280	There's no Wii Sports, right?
7824280	7827240	I'm kind of holding out actually for like a quest three.
7827240	7828840	Like I'm curious to see what that looks like.
7828840	7833080	Cause my kids' quest twos, like I've, I've used them a little bit while I set them up
7833080	7834120	and they're pretty nice.
7834120	7835000	Like it's not bad.
7835000	7840600	Like I have like a, uh, was it the Rift S or whatever, but that thing's pretty old at
7840600	7841240	this point.
7841240	7847160	And you know, I have a PlayStation VR as well, but like my computer is like, it can crank
7847160	7848520	out VR like nothing.
7848520	7852920	And I've been building a library as I do in Steam.
7853480	7857960	Um, but it would be nice to have some like modern hardware that could run it.
7857960	7861800	Uh, that I would play for like five minutes and then put it back in the box.
7861800	7862920	I, I have a callback.
7863560	7866840	I have a callback to something at the top of the show that I'm dying to get out here
7866840	7867480	with this story.
7867480	7869480	Cause it's, I just had an aha moment.
7869480	7870120	Okay.
7870120	7876520	So if Sony were to try to buy another studio that makes a VR game, shouldn't the UK block
7876520	7881640	that because it's to allow Microsoft to compete in that space?
7884280	7886200	To allow Nintendo to compete in that space?
7886920	7892520	If PlayStation wants to buy a company that makes VR games, shouldn't that be blocked
7892520	7897000	under the same logic that the UK blocked the Microsoft Activision deal?
7898840	7900360	I mean, none of it makes sense.
7900360	7901160	So sure.
7901160	7901960	I mean, why not?
7902520	7905480	I know, no, it doesn't make sense, but that's my point because I'm looking at that going,
7905480	7911240	well, Microsoft actively chose to pursue AR and then decided not to go down that route
7911240	7912120	at least for gaming.
7912120	7916040	I know they do it for other stuff, but, uh, they decided not to go down that route.
7916520	7923080	Microsoft and Nintendo kind of had that fold paper box VR thing.
7923080	7924040	It was, it's throw away.
7924040	7924520	It was nothing.
7924520	7931720	It's a non-issue, you know, as these companies are choosing not to participate here.
7931720	7936200	SSG100Matt says, if Sony wants to be sassy, Rob will sass back.
7936200	7938040	Hire Rob, Microsoft.
7938040	7939000	That's sweet of you to say.
7939000	7943000	I will say I have some friends who are getting good things for them.
7943000	7943720	It's Microsoft.
7943720	7944600	So that's great.
7944680	7947160	But I, I like my current day job is fine.
7947160	7949160	You know why my current day job is great?
7950120	7952040	Because I can separate it from all of this.
7953560	7954920	That's, that's great.
7954920	7957400	So it allows me to continue to be impartial.
7957400	7958600	So, all right.
7960440	7963000	Oh no, I just saw something terrible.
7963000	7963800	Oh no, who died?
7964920	7969320	No one, well, it's a site, um, forest of illusion closed.
7970040	7971000	Oh yeah.
7971960	7972760	I was trying.
7972760	7973080	Okay.
7973080	7978760	So we actually had a story, um, uh, dark to see it submitted a story about that, but I
7978760	7980600	couldn't get on the site while I was prepping.
7980600	7986920	So I had to cut the story, but I guess they had some ROM of like a hotel and 64 collection.
7986920	7988680	Here I am getting in the story anyway.
7988680	7991880	That was like a part of that, but yeah, they're, they're gone now.
7991880	7994760	So that's terrible.
7994760	7995400	Yeah.
7995400	7997640	And their YouTube and Twitter accounts are gone too.
7998440	7998940	Yeah.
7999180	8000380	All right.
8001100	8004460	Well, this is something that isn't gone yet, but it's probably going to be pretty soon.
8004460	8008460	And that is, uh, the game Portopia.
8009420	8012860	It is, if you don't know the name of the game, I don't blame you.
8012860	8016780	This is Square Enix's AI tech preview game.
8018140	8019340	So what happened?
8019340	8024620	Square Enix did a remastered version of the Portopia serial murder case, and it was to
8024620	8026220	showcase AI.
8026220	8027580	That preview is out now.
8028300	8030620	This was a classic adventure game from the eighties.
8030620	8034380	It was authored by Yuji Horii, who you probably know from Dragon Quest.
8034380	8037260	And this is now actually the first official release of the game in the West.
8037900	8041100	Technically, uh, this is a text adventure.
8041100	8043180	So it like parses text, right?
8043180	8046460	So you either type things in or you use speech to text in the game.
8047260	8051500	And in this game, you are a junior detective and, you know, do this whole thing.
8052140	8056780	But AI tech is through NLP, natural language processing.
8057260	8061420	So basically, you know, if you think about those classic games like Zork and things like
8061420	8067660	that, it's basically using AI to like translate what you're saying into the game's language
8067660	8070780	or, you know, that that's a really rough way to pretty much say it.
8071340	8078540	So, um, yeah, uh, I guess originally there was even going to be natural replies for
8078540	8083180	situations where the system didn't have a preordained answer, but they were worried
8083180	8086940	about unethical replies because, you know, somebody would get this game to say something
8086940	8090460	really, really bad, and then there'd be a clip of it all over the internet.
8090460	8093660	So Square rightfully kind of walked away from that.
8094300	8096060	But how is this going?
8096620	8101420	Well, the tech preview is up and it has a 10% positive review rating on Steam.
8102060	8106460	Most are finding frustration with the AI partner saying that basically,
8106460	8108780	Yasu gets stuck in response loops.
8109020	8112380	So some people have jumped in and played the game and said, yeah, it just,
8112380	8118460	so for example, I can, so you ask a question, like, was the murder weapon found at the scene?
8119260	8120940	It doesn't know what to do with it.
8120940	8122620	Did the victim live alone?
8122620	8123660	Doesn't know what to do with it.
8123660	8126140	So it's, it's just, it's not smart enough.
8127020	8132860	Like people, people are trying to make AI happen like way ahead where it's, and of course,
8133820	8140140	we all know it's really, it's a machine learning or as I call it autocomplete.
8140700	8147020	All of this AI stuff is like that autocomplete shit that shows up on, you know, uh, Gmail.
8147020	8151180	It's gone, gone way too far, turned up to 11.
8151900	8157900	It's like if the NYPD had a bring your kid to work day and they made this like top
8157900	8160300	detective's partner a two-year-old.
8160300	8170140	No, cause then the game would just be like, why, why, why, why it's a, it's a baby in a stroller.
8171100	8175660	Uh, fixation gaze and chat says I'm honestly way too tired of AI.
8175660	8176160	Same.
8177020	8178060	This is a buzzword.
8178060	8180220	I'm just, I'm already exhausted.
8181020	8184460	Like we're not ready for autocomplete to run society.
8184460	8184860	Stop.
8184860	8190220	I still found it creepy doing the voice thing today.
8191500	8191980	I don't.
8191980	8193500	And some of that, I don't know.
8193500	8194540	I don't, I don't know.
8194540	8199500	Cause that means you could like have people that are no longer with us having their voice again.
8199500	8200300	I don't know.
8200300	8203260	Maybe for historical figures that could be interesting, but I,
8204460	8206860	there's something about that that just weirds me out.
8206860	8208220	Maybe, maybe I just need to get over it.
8208220	8208720	I don't know.
8209180	8214220	So, well, it, the ones that I did for me, like it doesn't really
8214220	8218780	even sound much like me and all I had to do was change certain inflections
8218780	8220620	and it sounded completely different.
8221340	8225340	So I think we're still a far away from it being super believable.
8225340	8225840	Yep.
8226940	8227420	All right.
8227420	8231180	Well, with that, that was the last story that we had slotted for tonight.
8231180	8233020	So we're going to get to the listener round table.
8233020	8237500	And this is the part of the show where we invite your feedback via not just the chat room.
8237500	8241180	If you have some questions there, but you can also call in over at vognetwork.com
8241180	8243660	slash discord, and you can email us.
8243660	8247020	Participate at orange launch radio.com is place to email us.
8247020	8249340	I think we actually did get an email earlier in the week.
8249340	8250380	Didn't we, Darce Chakra?
8250380	8251980	We did actually.
8251980	8252940	Should I go ahead and read?
8252940	8253180	I know.
8253180	8257260	I feel like I, I just hope this wasn't just because of my threats last week,
8257260	8259500	but I appreciate the gesture all the same.
8259500	8260000	Thank you.
8261420	8262220	Yeah, please read it.
8262220	8262720	Yeah.
8263420	8267340	Well, as soon as it loads up, our mail site is not the fastest.
8267340	8268140	Oh, it logged me out.
8268140	8268940	No wonder.
8268940	8271340	Well then let me give a shout out one more time for that email address.
8271340	8271840	I've got it.
8271840	8273660	Participate at orange launch radio.com.
8275980	8276460	Hi, all.
8276460	8280300	Decided to drop this week's question in mail, in the mail.
8280300	8284460	So my gaming week consisted of cross code, which is a pixelated game about an avatar
8284460	8288620	who doesn't remember who she is or what she's doing in the location that she's in.
8288620	8288940	Sorry.
8288940	8291740	Trying to be as vague as possible in case someone wants to play the game too.
8292540	8294780	It gives the feel of a game within a game.
8294780	8298460	As you play the game, you learn you're an avatar in an MMO.
8298940	8304060	Basically, the story surrounds itself that the character, as she tries to regain her memories,
8304060	8309580	the next game I played is called Homestead Arcana, in which you play as a witch whose
8309580	8313580	task is to fix the land around her aunt's farm that has been corrupted by miasma,
8314620	8319180	all while trying to discover what happened to her aunt who somehow mysteriously disappeared.
8319180	8321740	And last but not least, Ghostwire Tokyo.
8321740	8323260	I've had that on my list for a bit.
8323820	8324540	It definitely...
8325980	8327660	Yeah, let me tell you that game is amazing.
8327660	8330220	It has minor challenges, but nothing game-breaking.
8330220	8331660	The story is really well done.
8331660	8335180	And being an open-world game, there's a lot to do within the game's six chapters.
8335180	8338140	I hope you guys had a great gaming week too.
8338140	8341180	Sincerely, Michi Kenz, aka Michi.
8342140	8343100	Thanks for the email, Mich.
8343100	8344380	It's good to hear about your gaming week.
8344380	8350060	And yeah, I know in some of my personal streams, you and DT have brought up Ghostwire Tokyo.
8350060	8354060	And yeah, that game, you definitely have all put that on my radar for sure.
8354060	8355740	It's nice that it's on Game Pass right now.
8356140	8359340	Um, so yeah, I have to check that out at some point.
8360140	8360640	For sure.
8361740	8364940	So by the way, I went ahead and pulled up the...
8366220	8369420	It's the Nintendo LodgeNet 64 gateway system.
8369420	8370060	That was it.
8370060	8370620	Okay, yeah.
8371420	8371920	Yep.
8372620	8376780	And yeah, they put the entire ROM catalog on there.
8377340	8381340	And, but there were some games that said that was missing from it.
8381980	8387340	Um, and going through the Wayback Machine, the link is completely broken.
8388220	8388940	Ah, okay.
8389820	8395420	But if anyone is interested, I know I won't have any ability to really, you know,
8395420	8399420	give the address to our podcast listeners.
8399420	8403420	But I'll share the Wayback link in chat, and I'll put it on my Twitter.
8404220	8404860	Awesome, awesome.
8406060	8406860	All right.
8406860	8408540	Well, thank you very much for the email, Mich.
8408620	8412380	And by the way, I have played that CrossCode game as well.
8412380	8414860	You'd have to go back a ways to when that game first came out on Game Pass,
8414860	8416700	but I didn't get very far.
8416700	8417820	I probably need to revisit it.
8417820	8421820	But you know, then a shiny new game comes out or a shiny old game
8421820	8423660	recaptures my attention like Skyrim.
8423660	8425340	And then it's like, I never finished what I start.
8425340	8428140	So that's why committing to beating...
8428140	8429340	I used to be very...
8429340	8431500	And this is just a personal thing I had to get over.
8432060	8435580	I used to be very against playing narrative games on stream,
8436300	8440780	because I don't always love to pick up a game part way through as a viewer,
8440780	8442940	because I don't understand what happened to get to that point.
8443660	8446860	But I've kind of found that especially through some classic games,
8446860	8450380	like the Final Fantasy Picture Remaster, it's whatever, you know,
8450380	8454300	because at the end of the day, the game mechanics are still the same, right?
8454300	8455580	So there's that.
8455580	8459020	So it's a little personal journey I'm going on, for whatever it's worth.
8460700	8462300	I do have another story.
8462300	8462940	Oh, please.
8462940	8464620	Yeah, last minute stories are awesome.
8464620	8465660	So go ahead, DarkSakura.
8466620	8469020	So you know that terrible CDI Zelda game?
8469980	8471100	Unfortunately, yes, I do.
8472140	8473260	Well, there are two of them, right?
8474860	8480940	Well, I'm referring specifically to the Zelda Faces of Evil
8480940	8483020	and Zelda Wand of Gamelan together.
8483020	8483520	Okay.
8484300	8485260	There was also...
8485980	8487260	I mean, they're all pretty bad.
8487980	8492780	But someone has done a game called Zelda's Adventure based on those games
8492860	8495020	as a demake for Game Boy.
8498060	8507660	And just looking it over, it actually will work on an original Game Boy,
8508860	8513820	if you've got a flash cart for it or other methods of playing it.
8515580	8520460	But it incorporates some of the features from Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons
8520460	8522620	and uses the visual style of Link's Awakening.
8523340	8524940	Those are good games.
8524940	8526860	I like the Oracle of Ages and Seasons.
8526860	8531580	And apparently people are saying that it's actually a pretty decent game.
8531580	8532080	Okay.
8532860	8535260	Unlike the inspiration for it.
8536780	8537340	That's okay.
8537340	8539900	Sometimes there's a good story to be found in there somewhere.
8540780	8541900	Just thought I'd share.
8541900	8543900	No, I appreciate the last minute story.
8543900	8545980	Loki, did you have anything on your plate for last minute stories?
8547260	8550860	Yeah, there's this cool mod that looks like it was showcased that
8550860	8551360	uses...
8553340	8554780	It's for Skyrim VR.
8554780	8560460	It uses ChatGPT to basically allow you to talk to NPCs in the game.
8560460	8565500	And then they respond back with all sorts of randomly created dialogue, I guess.
8566700	8570620	It's not great because it's slow.
8570620	8575980	But the dialogue is pretty good for an NPC.
8575980	8579420	And they synthesize the voice using the NPC voices.
8579500	8581980	Doesn't sound great because it is recreated with AI.
8582700	8585020	But it's a thing.
8586940	8589900	I'm really worried that in the next couple of years,
8589900	8592220	in some of these open world games that we're going to see,
8592220	8597820	we're going to see people try to use AI to sort of make an open world seem more open.
8597820	8603260	I just, I would really caution the industry to implement something like this before it's ready.
8603260	8608380	I think the narrative on this is moving way faster than it should be.
8608460	8610300	I don't think it's going to be.
8610300	8612620	I mean, yeah, we probably will see that in a couple of years.
8612620	8614700	But this is the worst it's ever going to be.
8616060	8618700	So like, you know, it's only going to get better from here,
8618700	8620700	and it's already gotten better so fast.
8621660	8625340	So yeah, in a couple of years, it should be ready to rock.
8625340	8625840	I don't know.
8627340	8629100	But yeah, don't get me wrong.
8630780	8635020	I fully intend, fully expect the game industry to screw it up somehow.
8635020	8638780	Like, you know, it's publishers doing what publishers do best,
8638780	8642460	where they push games to be done before they're done.
8642460	8644700	And so you get technical hitches.
8644700	8652380	And so yeah, you will end up, you know, with AI not acting correctly if they cut corners.
8653660	8658780	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says Ubisoft already replaced their junior level writers with GPT.
8658780	8661420	Well, Ubisoft is run by a fucking moron.
8661420	8663100	Let me go on the record and say that too.
8664060	8666860	Like, unfortunately, I'm not surprised to hear that.
8666860	8669260	But they're going to pay the price when those games come out.
8669260	8674780	And then Zen Monkey 11 follows that up with some friends of mine were in VR chat talking with AI,
8674780	8678380	and it called one of them a slur we don't say ever.
8678940	8681180	So game devs need to be careful with that shit.
8681180	8681820	Absolutely.
8681820	8685180	And Ubisoft is going to get that in some clip of their game,
8685180	8687180	because they thought AI was a good idea.
8687180	8693900	Like, Ubisoft is run by a fucking idiot.
8693900	8695340	Quote it, put it on the back of the box.
8698620	8700220	Anyway, any other last minute stories?
8701820	8702700	No, that's it.
8702700	8703200	Okay.
8704620	8708060	I am in agreement about fuckery.
8708060	8708560	Yeah.
8708940	8709180	All right.
8709180	8711580	Well, I'm sorry to leave things on a sour note tonight.
8711580	8714380	But I think that's all we have on our agenda tonight.
8714380	8715100	And you know what?
8715100	8718540	We didn't have any FUs of the Week music.
8718540	8719100	No, no.
8720140	8721820	And here's the whole thing.
8721820	8725900	Bobby says in their defense, they're just using GPT to write the script for the random
8725900	8726620	NPCs.
8726620	8728620	They won't directly talk to GPT.
8729580	8730380	Okay, today.
8733020	8736780	And even then, I just, I don't know.
8736780	8740220	It's, you can't replace artists.
8740220	8740940	Stop trying.
8741500	8742000	All right.
8742560	8746960	That is all I have to say on that.
8747840	8750720	Let's wrap things up for the night.
8750720	8751200	You know what?
8751200	8754800	I could honestly use a nap after last night, so I'm okay if we're done a little bit early
8754800	8755300	tonight.
8755920	8758880	But let's get on out of here for the night.
8758880	8761680	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, please tell a friend or two about
8761680	8762240	the show.
8762240	8765200	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we
8765200	8767600	need more voices to put out here on air.
8767600	8772320	So leave us a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you
8772320	8772960	found this show.
8772960	8774160	It goes an awful long way.
8774160	8777120	Oh, I forgot to check Spotify to see if we had any comments.
8777120	8780720	Leave us a comment on that thing that they added.
8780720	8785440	So yeah, and I promise I'll check those this week.
8785440	8788000	And yes, this is Joe 100 Matt says, join the Discord.
8788000	8789120	All of those things.
8789120	8792400	Okay, let's wrap up and get on out of here for the night.
8792400	8794320	But Dark Sakura, you go first.
8794320	8795280	Your final thought for the night.
8797600	8801840	Um, I am, I don't know.
8801840	8807760	I, I've, Gwen, you know, has been in a really bad state.
8807760	8814400	And on my Twitter, I have linked her GoFundMe so that she can afford to pay her bills.
8816560	8819280	So I haven't heard from her in three days.
8820320	8821200	And I'm really worried.
8822160	8828640	So I would just say if anyone can do anything to help the link of it is a pinned post on
8828640	8831040	my Twitter at Dark Sakura.
8831600	8835120	And if anyone can do anything to help her out, I'd greatly appreciate it.
8835120	8840080	Can you please let us know on the socials or Discord when you hear that's the that's
8840080	8841280	an alarming thing to hear.
8841280	8842080	I'm sorry to hear that.
8842800	8844560	I'm really worried.
8844560	8848320	Yeah, I mean, she's she's had problems with depression for a while.
8848320	8850480	And I know this is only making it worse.
8850480	8853600	And I'm, I'm really worried.
8853600	8856800	I mean, she's one of my longest friends.
8856800	8862960	And, you know, she was, you know, worried that, you know, power would be shut down.
8862960	8864320	No phone, no internet.
8864320	8869040	And I mean, I know that there's, sorry, my notes are just grace periods, but I would
8869040	8873520	just really appreciate it that if there's anything that you contribute, even if it's
8873520	8879040	just reposting the link for my Twitter, I would greatly appreciate it to spread the
8879040	8883120	word and we needed to have the money already raised by now.
8884160	8886640	But we need at least 500 bucks.
8888000	8890160	So the link is there.
8890160	8890880	If you can.
8890880	8891200	Great.
8891200	8892880	If you can't, it's understandable.
8894080	8894580	All right.
8895120	8897920	Well, I know you're on your way out to go.
8897920	8899440	Yeah, run around.
8899440	8899760	All right.
8899760	8900800	Have fun in Dead by Daylight.
8900800	8901360	We'll see you later.
8902960	8903600	See you soon.
8904240	8905600	Later taters.
8905600	8905920	All right.
8905920	8908400	Let's head over to Loki your final thought tonight.
8910000	8915120	My final thought is I feel like I'm sprinting when it comes to content creation.
8916400	8920320	And I had to keep sprinting for another three months.
8921520	8922640	Hey, we're tired.
8922640	8925600	Celebrate the goalposts you do have.
8925600	8926880	You have a thousand followers.
8927440	8929280	I don't have that many on Twitch.
8929280	8930160	You got you got more.
8930160	8931600	I think you have more than Jamie too.
8931600	8933520	So you got you got lots, lots of followers.
8933520	8934240	Good for you.
8934240	8934800	It's great.
8934800	8935440	Celebrate that.
8935440	8935940	Yeah.
8936800	8937520	Congrats.
8937520	8938400	You earned it.
8938400	8939760	You work very hard on those videos.
8939760	8943040	And one of these days people will fucking see that.
8943040	8944400	And it's they're seeing it.
8944400	8945600	It's slow, but they're seeing it.
8945600	8946240	Long hours.
8946240	8946800	Yes.
8946800	8949440	It's the same thing I tell YYR behind those games.
8949440	8952240	One of these days, somebody's going to see super multitasking.
8952240	8953360	It finally did happen.
8953360	8955040	It just maybe didn't catch the wildfire.
8955040	8957680	I thought maybe being featured in a video like that would.
8957680	8960640	But, you know, one of these days, one of these days.
8962560	8966080	My final thought, I guess I'll also update on my personal stream stuff.
8966080	8968480	So Monday, I think we're going to do some Theatrhythm.
8968480	8970720	I think I'm going to just do a marathon Theatrhythm stream
8970720	8973120	and really try to play every song once and try to get through
8973120	8974880	that portion of the game and get that trophy.
8976160	8978880	And then Tuesday, I'm going to start Stranger of Paradise
8978880	8979840	Final Fantasy Origin.
8979840	8981680	I'll hold the box up one more time because I've done it,
8981680	8983040	like, 70 times tonight.
8983040	8983760	So we'll do that.
8985040	8985520	There we go.
8986080	8987360	Thank you, Jaskren, for asking.
8987360	8988960	What's Loki's YouTube handle again?
8988960	8990640	It is loki.olr on YouTube.
8990640	8991200	All one word.
8991200	8992240	No underscores or dashes.
8992960	8994880	So and thank you for the link, Mike Deft.
8994880	8999440	If you want to follow me on Twitch, you can here at Rob Roberts
8999440	9001920	and then DarkSakura will be rating in just a moment.
9001920	9004080	So just stay tuned and we'll hop into her channel.
9004880	9005760	That's it.
9005760	9007840	She's DarkSakura underscore O-L-R for the...
9007840	9008400	I forgot.
9008400	9011040	We also have podcast listeners who don't get to automatically
9011040	9012480	rate right after the feed.
9012480	9013760	So that's it.
9013760	9014160	We're done.
9014160	9015200	We're going to wrap up for the night.
9015200	9016640	Thank you so much, everybody.
9016640	9018320	We'll see you in seven days.
9018320	9021040	I need a nap and then I'm going to play some video games.
9021040	9022240	Have a good night, everybody.
9022240	9022800	Bye-bye.
9052240	9065600	We're all still true.
