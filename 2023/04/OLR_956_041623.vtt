00:00.000 --> 00:13.760
It's been over a decade since yours truly was on Orange Lounge Radio, reporting on Nintendo's

00:13.760 --> 00:18.160
Wii U pre-release tour, and since then Nintendo Directs have become hugely relevant to fans.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.920
Nintendo has always had a great presence in Japan, but now they are getting back into

00:20.920 --> 00:23.240
the convention by and about them game stateside.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
What's next?

00:24.240 --> 00:27.000
A theme park section devoted to their popular franchises?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.240
Oh, right, that happened already.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
It's a me.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.320
And now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:33.320 --> 00:36.240
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
gamer has a voice.

00:39.440 --> 00:44.480
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:44.480 --> 00:46.480
where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.480 --> 00:53.440
It is Orange Lounge Radio, and we are back and live and ready to go once again with episode

00:53.440 --> 00:59.560
number 956 of our show for tonight, April the 16th of 2023.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.640
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you every week as we tape our show live, broadcast

01:04.640 --> 01:08.640
it out to the world, and put it all up in a podcast for people to consume throughout

01:08.640 --> 01:12.480
the week to talk about the latest and greatest in video games and gaming culture and all

01:12.480 --> 01:13.880
that good stuff.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.560
Like I said, I'm Rob, and with me are my co-hosts.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.640
Say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Sommers.

01:19.640 --> 01:20.640
Hello.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.640
I'm getting ready.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.840
Getting ready?

01:23.840 --> 01:29.440
Well, I was going to say, so now we've transitioned from your birthday month to your birthday

01:29.440 --> 01:30.440
week.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.440
So happy birthday week.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.440
It's holy week now.

01:35.440 --> 01:42.440
And how do we celebrate the golden week of Dark Sakura's birthday?

01:42.440 --> 01:45.440
Should I bake a cake with strawberries?

01:45.440 --> 01:52.440
Actually, I'm meeting a fellow streamer on Tuesday, Silly Candy, who lives in our area.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.440
And we're going to go to Danielle's for crepes.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
Oh, yum.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.440
I love that place.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.440
I love crepes.

01:59.440 --> 02:05.440
I haven't been in an age, but it's going to be fun.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.440
And then, of course, my subathon thing is more like a suggestion.

02:08.440 --> 02:13.440
It's just like, come hang out with me while you get to see me in increasing levels of

02:13.440 --> 02:14.440
sleep deprivation.

02:14.440 --> 02:19.440
And I'm going to play more than Dead by Daylight, probably, maybe.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.440
I'll definitely be there.

02:21.440 --> 02:25.440
I won't be able to be there till after work because I have a very, very busy work week,

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
but I'll be there eventually.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.440
That's fine.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.440
Oh, geez.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.440
Just make it worth the wait.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
Uh-oh, we have a spill.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.440
Clean up on Isle Jamie.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.440
All right.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.440
Yeah, and all my new shirts, too.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.440
While you work on that, I'm going to go over to Tech Master Loki.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
Hey, Loki.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
How are you doing?

02:42.440 --> 02:43.440
I'm doing pretty good.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.440
Yeah?

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
How's your week going?

02:45.440 --> 02:46.440
I'm tired.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.440
Yeah?

02:48.440 --> 02:52.440
I'm hungover, so that makes two of us.

02:52.440 --> 02:59.440
I saw you were going full Karen on the Minecraft Twitter this week asking for the results of

02:59.440 --> 03:00.440
the contest.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.440
It's been a month.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.440
It has been a month.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.440
You still haven't heard anything, huh?

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
Nope.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.440
All right.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.440
Maybe, I guess.

03:08.440 --> 03:14.440
They closed down the channel on Discord, too, for that particular, well, just for that particular

03:14.440 --> 03:16.440
content, because it's so over now.

03:16.440 --> 03:24.440
It's just like, okay, somebody forgot, because they've run like two or three more contests

03:24.440 --> 03:27.440
since then, and they've had results.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
Oh, no.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.440
Anybody?

03:29.440 --> 03:33.440
The intern who is in charge of that competition unfortunately got sacked.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.440
I actually hope that's not true.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.440
I would actually feel bad if that was legit the case, but unfortunately, that's the world

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
we live in.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.440
Well, hopefully, it ends up being one of those good things come to those who wait sort of

03:44.440 --> 03:45.440
situation.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
All right.

03:47.440 --> 03:50.440
Of course, we do tape our show live, as I was mentioning earlier, every Sunday night

03:50.440 --> 03:54.440
at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
VOG Network.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.440
That's V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.440
You can watch us as we answer your comments in our chat if you want to chat along with

04:04.440 --> 04:09.440
our show live over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

04:09.440 --> 04:14.440
Interesting, as the show owner Matt says, maybe it's Capcom holding things up.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.440
Hmm.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.440
Maybe.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.440
Maybe it's Maybelline.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.440
Maybe it is.

04:18.440 --> 04:23.440
Pod Culture says, I won an Injustice 3, so our little intro joke tonight for the Twitch

04:23.440 --> 04:28.440
had to do with Injustice turning 10 years old, because that was a PS3 game.

04:28.440 --> 04:32.440
Technically, Injustice qualifies as Classic Game of the Week at this point, which is wild

04:32.440 --> 04:35.440
to think about, and it's one of those things where it's like, oh, where did time go?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.440
That is really-

04:36.440 --> 04:39.440
It also has a really terrible looking arcade game.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.440
I just don't understand-

04:41.440 --> 04:43.440
Isn't it a ticket spitter?

04:43.440 --> 04:47.440
Maybe, but there's no joystick on it.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.440
It's just attack buttons.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.440
I saw that.

04:51.440 --> 04:55.440
I happened to randomly be at round one in Roseville yesterday, so maybe getting into

04:55.440 --> 04:57.440
my gaming week a little bit, but we decided to do so.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.440
My friends and I, they all play Pikmin.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.440
We wanted to get our 10,000 steps in, but it was a little warm yesterday, and I haven't

05:04.440 --> 05:10.440
had to worry about this for the last 17 years, because our local sports ball team is actually

05:10.440 --> 05:15.440
in the playoffs for the first time almost ever, walking down-

05:15.440 --> 05:16.440
That's the name of hell that happened.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.440
Yeah, I know, right?

05:17.440 --> 05:18.440
What the hell?

05:18.440 --> 05:22.440
Apparently, not to get too into sports, because y'all won't know what show you're listening

05:22.440 --> 05:28.440
to if I do that, but apparently, the new coach they got is so good, he's like the coach of

05:28.440 --> 05:30.440
the year for the whole NBA.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.440
Let's see if he can turn our team around.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.440
Yeah, I know, right?

05:35.440 --> 05:40.440
It was always like when I was in band, if we did a bad marching show, our football team

05:40.440 --> 05:41.440
would win.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.440
That's what I'm feeling like.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.440
Anyway, the point was we couldn't go walking downtown.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.440
We didn't want to go walking downtown, because it's going to be a little bit of a shit show

05:49.440 --> 05:50.440
with all that going on.

05:50.440 --> 05:55.440
Once they light the beam, it goes nuts, so we didn't want to walk down there.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.440
We were actually in midtown yesterday for dinner.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.440
Oh, no.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.440
Well, no, it was fine, because we were way on the other side, but originally, our plans

06:02.440 --> 06:08.440
were like, oh, yeah, after dinner, we're going to go to downtown to go to this underground

06:08.440 --> 06:12.440
mini golf place, and I'm like...

06:12.440 --> 06:14.440
Oh, the putt-putt golf thing there?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.440
Yeah, there's like a...

06:16.440 --> 06:17.440
That place is cute.

06:17.440 --> 06:20.440
I went to a drag bingo there during the week once.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.440
It's that putt-putt golf or whatever is cute.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.440
Yeah.

06:23.440 --> 06:24.440
Oh, shit.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.440
It's right next to the arena.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.440
Yeah.

06:26.440 --> 06:27.440
We were going to go there.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.440
I was like, I don't want to go there during playoff.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.440
No, you don't.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.440
No, you don't.

06:31.440 --> 06:37.440
That was a wise decision, because from what I understand, there were lots of people watching

06:37.440 --> 06:41.440
the game outside, because if you've walked by the arena, they have giant LED screens

06:41.440 --> 06:45.440
there, so if you weren't in the arena watching the game, you could watch outside, and it

06:45.440 --> 06:46.440
was packed.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.440
Then, of course, oh, my God, I really am talking about sports on Orange Launch Radio.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
What the...

06:51.440 --> 06:52.440
It must be April.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.440
What the fuck is going on here in this day?

06:54.440 --> 07:00.140
Anyway, because all those people were there, so I made a little joke about light the beam,

07:00.140 --> 07:02.140
which has become this big thing in Sacramento.

07:02.140 --> 07:07.140
Whenever the Kings win a game, they literally have a purple space laser that they fire into

07:07.140 --> 07:11.140
the air, and they shine it until midnight, and you can see it from all over town.

07:11.140 --> 07:15.140
Now, thanks to this, everybody screams, light the beam.

07:15.140 --> 07:20.140
I picture a very, what was her name in Austin Powers?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.140
Frow.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.140
Frow.

07:22.140 --> 07:23.140
Yes.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.140
Yeah.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.140
Light the beam.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.140
It's her whenever they win.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.140
And here's my thing.

07:29.140 --> 07:35.140
Why stand outside when you could be at home in your pajamas watching it?

07:35.140 --> 07:37.140
Why do people tailgate?

07:37.140 --> 07:38.140
It's the same thing.

07:38.140 --> 07:46.140
Because Kings players, or excuse me, Kings fans are insane, and I have tons of friends

07:46.140 --> 07:47.140
who are Kings fans.

07:47.140 --> 07:53.140
I say that with tongue firmly planted in cheek, but when it's the only professional sports

07:53.140 --> 07:58.140
thing at all your town of a million people has, people get really into it.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.140
It was funny.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.140
I didn't know what light the beam was for the longest time.

08:03.140 --> 08:06.140
It's like I've seen bumper stickers on cars that said light the beam.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.140
I'm like, is this a cult or something?

08:08.140 --> 08:09.140
What is this?

08:09.140 --> 08:11.140
They have minor league baseball.

08:11.140 --> 08:13.140
As it turns out, Loki, yes, it is a cult.

08:13.140 --> 08:14.140
It's more fun.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.140
Yeah, no.

08:15.140 --> 08:20.140
Well, it goes to show, yeah, I see people in chat talking about soccer, and yeah, people

08:20.140 --> 08:22.140
get really into minor league soccer.

08:22.140 --> 08:26.140
I would say the River Cats probably have more of a fan following than most minor league

08:26.140 --> 08:27.140
teams out there.

08:27.140 --> 08:30.140
I would be willing to wage money on that.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.140
Then our local soccer, the Free Republic, what is it?

08:34.140 --> 08:39.140
FC Republic, Sac FC Republic that plays at Cal Expo, those games are always well attended

08:39.140 --> 08:40.140
too.

08:40.140 --> 08:43.140
They've been trying to push soccer here for a long time.

08:43.140 --> 08:49.140
I think the pandemic threw a lot of that for a loop, but they definitely want soccer here

08:49.140 --> 08:50.140
full-time.

08:50.140 --> 08:51.140
This town is full of soccer moms.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.140
Real football.

08:52.140 --> 08:53.140
Yeah, actual football.

08:53.140 --> 08:54.140
Real football.

08:54.140 --> 09:02.140
All right, anyway, I promise that's all the sports tonight.

09:02.140 --> 09:08.140
Whatever few listeners we had left finally turned it off like, wow, OLRs talking about

09:08.140 --> 09:09.140
sports.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.140
I don't know what the fuck happened.

09:10.140 --> 09:14.140
If you're watching live, you can just pay attention to the video that's behind my head.

09:14.140 --> 09:16.140
I don't even know you anymore.

09:16.140 --> 09:17.140
What the hell is that?

09:18.140 --> 09:22.140
Is this some skateboard game that's got bugs galore?

09:22.140 --> 09:23.140
It looks like.

09:23.140 --> 09:24.140
What is that, Logie?

09:24.140 --> 09:27.140
It's Skate 3, but it's Helix Snake.

09:27.140 --> 09:32.140
Helix Snake used to exploit a bunch of different glitches in that game and has the most hilarious

09:32.140 --> 09:33.140
videos.

09:33.140 --> 09:37.140
I've watched his videos for 10 years now, and I can still go back to them, and they're

09:37.140 --> 09:39.140
just as hilarious as the first time.

09:39.140 --> 09:41.140
I'm going to try not to crack myself.

09:41.140 --> 09:44.140
I'm just going to try not to look at my video behind me.

09:45.140 --> 09:50.140
They're just the stupidest, most hilarious things because Skate 3 was kind of cool because

09:50.140 --> 09:55.140
you could actually do tricks and stuff, and you can set up your own ramps and everything.

09:55.140 --> 09:57.140
You can actually move stuff around in the world.

09:57.140 --> 10:03.140
Plus, I have a really cool camera system that you could set up cameras and record replays

10:03.140 --> 10:07.140
and stuff like that, and so he really explains that.

10:07.140 --> 10:11.140
Aren't video games supposed to be a little bit ridiculous at the end of the day?

10:11.140 --> 10:12.140
Isn't that why we love them?

10:12.140 --> 10:13.140
I don't know.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.140
All right.

10:14.140 --> 10:19.140
I'm going to ask for all those people who demand realism.

10:19.140 --> 10:25.140
It says from the same people who like giant enemy crabs.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.140
All right.

10:26.140 --> 10:30.140
I'm sorry, this game does not have enough crabs.

10:30.140 --> 10:36.140
Let's get into our lead topic tonight, which is a very interesting announcement out of

10:36.140 --> 10:43.140
Nintendo that has a lot of people wondering, is this timed with recent E3 announcements?

10:43.140 --> 10:45.140
What's going on here?

10:45.140 --> 10:47.140
Let's dissect this a little bit and see what we think about it.

10:47.140 --> 10:51.140
Loki, do you want to bring us up to speed on what Nintendo put out on the table this week?

10:51.140 --> 10:56.140
Yeah, so Nintendo is doing a Nintendo Live 2023 Seattle.

10:56.140 --> 11:01.140
It's an event that's going to be there that's basically filled with different stage performances.

11:01.140 --> 11:05.140
They're going to have game tournaments, photo ops, and whatnot.

11:05.140 --> 11:10.140
It kind of reminds me of those like Best Buy tours that they used to do, except now

11:10.140 --> 11:16.140
just like in one central location type of thing, which it makes sense that they would

11:16.140 --> 11:21.140
do it in Washington because, you know, the Nintendo North America there.

11:21.140 --> 11:27.140
So, yeah, so they're going to be doing that and it's kind of almost like their own live event.

11:27.140 --> 11:33.140
I imagine it's obviously not as big as it's going to, you know, anything else, but it's

11:33.140 --> 11:37.140
not as big as internet fanboys are already pitching it as, is what you're saying?

11:37.140 --> 11:39.140
Because that's, I think, a very valid concern.

11:39.140 --> 11:41.140
Yes, yes.

11:41.140 --> 11:45.140
Like think the mall tours that they used to do like a while back when malls were a thing.

11:45.140 --> 11:47.140
It's kind of like that.

11:47.140 --> 11:53.140
I think the venue announcement will be very key as to what size they're undertaking here,

11:53.140 --> 11:59.140
because if they are going to the Seattle Convention Center, which I, you know, again,

11:59.140 --> 12:03.140
you know what else is in September in Seattle is PAX West.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.140
I guess it's actually branded as now.

12:05.140 --> 12:09.140
It's not PAX Prime anymore, but it's PAX West is also in September in Seattle.

12:09.140 --> 12:15.140
So I don't see, you know, again, September's, you know, four or five weekends in the month.

12:15.140 --> 12:19.140
So it's not to say that Nintendo couldn't be doing it later in the month, but if they're

12:19.140 --> 12:24.140
doing Labor Day weekend as well, that venue is probably not available.

12:24.140 --> 12:28.140
So I think that the venue announcement will be very important to the scope because they

12:28.140 --> 12:34.140
could also, I mean, you could have PAX going on there and you could have them over at Seattle Center.

12:34.140 --> 12:38.140
You could have where like Space Needle and all that is you could have because Pokemon

12:38.140 --> 12:40.140
Go Fest was over there.

12:40.140 --> 12:44.140
Now, granted, Pokemon Go Fest is mostly outdoors, but Seattle Center does have a large indoor

12:44.140 --> 12:50.140
setup for events that technically this could it could be big enough to hold something like

12:50.140 --> 12:51.140
this for sure.

12:51.140 --> 12:56.140
But I think that's going to be key is like what or is it, you know, the double tree?

12:56.140 --> 12:58.140
Like where where is this at?

12:58.140 --> 13:03.140
It would be very key to what is the scope of this?

13:03.140 --> 13:09.140
I'm surprised that they didn't try to do something like at like their Nintendo Land parks or

13:09.140 --> 13:14.140
Super Mario World parks, whatever those are called, because you would think that that

13:14.140 --> 13:17.140
would be a good way to like, hey, we just put out a movie.

13:17.140 --> 13:21.140
We have these parks, you know, hey, come on down, you know, type of thing.

13:21.140 --> 13:25.140
Like do like a partnership with Universal or something like that.

13:25.140 --> 13:28.140
Well, Loki, I wouldn't I wouldn't write that off.

13:28.140 --> 13:32.140
I wouldn't necessarily write that off because I you know, and I know you kind of brought

13:32.140 --> 13:37.140
that comparison to the mall tour, which, you know, yeah, but there's something about this

13:37.140 --> 13:39.140
that makes me feel like it's a little more than that.

13:39.140 --> 13:42.140
And Bobby and I know he's talking about this on his show and he says in our chat room,

13:42.140 --> 13:45.140
Bobby Blackwell says Space World 2023.

13:45.140 --> 13:47.140
Maybe.

13:47.140 --> 13:49.140
Well, here's the thing.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.140
Here's the thing.

13:50.140 --> 13:53.140
There's a couple there's a couple of ways to go with this.

13:53.140 --> 13:57.140
There's a part of me that's kind of chewing on why this year, because hasn't Nintendo

13:57.140 --> 14:01.140
been pretty open about they don't really have anything for the holiday this year.

14:01.140 --> 14:06.140
Now, I don't know if I necessarily believe that, especially with as big as Mario is this

14:06.140 --> 14:07.140
year.

14:07.140 --> 14:14.140
And it's been how many years since a Mario game like could they not do at the bare minimum

14:14.140 --> 14:20.140
either Super Mario Odyssey 2, Super Luigi Odyssey, hell, Super Peach Odyssey, you know,

14:20.140 --> 14:22.140
in tandem with the movie.

14:22.140 --> 14:29.140
Or even less than that, like, hey, let's just port over Mario Galaxy 2.

14:29.140 --> 14:35.140
That's exactly what or fucking just Super Mario All-Stars 2023, you know, for a new

14:35.140 --> 14:36.140
generation.

14:36.140 --> 14:37.140
That's just a repackaging of all the old shit.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.140
You know what?

14:38.140 --> 14:41.140
If they put a few new things in it, people eat it up.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.140
Fine, whatever.

14:42.140 --> 14:46.140
I'd go for a port of Super Paper Mario because that was awesome.

14:47.140 --> 14:52.140
So, I mean, there could be something in that, you know, but I have to put it out there.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.140
People are going to speculate.

14:54.140 --> 14:59.140
I don't know how much I would hedge my bets on this, but could it be a new system?

14:59.140 --> 15:02.140
Could Nintendo be using this event to launch a new system?

15:02.140 --> 15:03.140
No.

15:03.140 --> 15:04.140
I say they could.

15:04.140 --> 15:05.140
I wouldn't be so quick to write it off.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.140
Why are you so quick to write it off?

15:07.140 --> 15:11.140
Because I don't think that they're going to put more, because to me, this feels like

15:11.140 --> 15:15.140
just the same type of effort that they put in to their tournaments around E3.

15:15.140 --> 15:19.140
I just don't think that they're doing, like, this isn't going to be to launch a new system

15:19.140 --> 15:24.140
because it would be bigger than just Seattle if it was that type of thing.

15:24.140 --> 15:27.140
But see, it could start.

15:27.140 --> 15:32.140
You kind of say that, you know, the theme parks, I could see, and this type of thing

15:32.140 --> 15:36.140
has absolutely happened before with E3 is that they would take their E3 booth and then

15:36.140 --> 15:38.140
they toured around the nation at malls and things like that.

15:38.140 --> 15:42.140
Not the whole booth, but the same demos and builds they were showing in the booth, they

15:42.140 --> 15:44.140
would take around the malls and all that stuff.

15:44.140 --> 15:49.140
So it's not to say that whatever they end up unveiling in September, they can't then

15:49.140 --> 15:54.140
have a couple kiosks at the theme park, have a mall tour on top of that, you know, during

15:54.140 --> 15:58.140
the holidays, especially when whatever this is that they're showing is going to be on

15:58.140 --> 15:59.140
sale.

15:59.140 --> 16:07.140
Like, even though I am not quite convinced it is a new system, there is something they've

16:07.140 --> 16:09.140
got to be announcing with this.

16:09.140 --> 16:13.140
Otherwise, I don't understand the pomp and circumstance of this now.

16:13.140 --> 16:18.140
Now, granted, this is something they could have been planning for 2020 and because of

16:18.140 --> 16:22.140
obviously everything that's happened in the world in 2020 and since then, this is the

16:22.140 --> 16:26.140
first year where they can feel like they could do something like this now.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.140
They haven't been able to do it until now.

16:27.140 --> 16:34.140
So it's hard to say, but I feel like they've got to have something new, even if it's just

16:34.140 --> 16:38.140
a new title for, like we said, a rebranding of an old title, whatever.

16:38.140 --> 16:41.140
And then they could end up, you know, touring that around or what have you.

16:42.140 --> 16:47.140
Dr. Tutsi in chat says, well, there were some rumblings of some new Donkey Kong, supposedly

16:47.140 --> 16:49.140
not a country sequel, though.

16:49.140 --> 16:54.140
That could be interesting, especially if that is being lined up for the next movie.

16:54.140 --> 16:59.140
I know we all say that there's for sure going to be a Super Mario sequel.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.140
Absolutely.

17:00.140 --> 17:04.140
But with the business that movie continues to do in its second week, still number one

17:04.140 --> 17:11.140
at the box office, shut down Nicolas Cage, for God's sake, that movie's got some staying

17:11.140 --> 17:12.140
power.

17:12.140 --> 17:19.140
So, you know, predicting that a sequel to the Mario movie will happen is the literal

17:19.140 --> 17:21.140
safest thing you could predict.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.140
Yes, there will be a sequel.

17:23.140 --> 17:29.140
But the question really is, which comes out first, the sequel to that or the very clear

17:29.140 --> 17:32.140
Donkey Kong spinoff they're also setting up in that movie?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.140
Well, it's OK.

17:35.140 --> 17:42.140
Next year, we can we can say Academy Award winning Super Mario Brothers movie because

17:42.140 --> 17:45.140
what else do you think that song is going to win the best?

17:45.140 --> 17:49.140
I think it's going to win best animated picture because what else is coming out?

17:49.140 --> 17:52.140
You've got the other.

17:52.140 --> 17:56.140
Was it the other Pixar movie coming out, which I just think it's kind of to me, it's just

17:56.140 --> 17:58.140
too much like inside out.

17:58.140 --> 18:00.140
I don't know if Disney really has any other things.

18:00.140 --> 18:05.140
They have the live action Little Mermaid, which is animated, obviously.

18:05.140 --> 18:09.140
I don't know what other animated movies are in the pipeline.

18:09.140 --> 18:20.140
Foreign film disrupts something out of Japan or another country, the unknown mix to the

18:20.140 --> 18:21.140
equation.

18:21.140 --> 18:24.140
It's happened before.

18:24.140 --> 18:28.140
And Def says Disney does have a movie later in the year, if I recall correctly.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.140
So it'll be interesting.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.140
I don't know.

18:30.140 --> 18:34.140
I could see that the song gets nominated because there's certainly a lot of buzz around that,

18:34.140 --> 18:35.140
which is kind of surprised me.

18:35.140 --> 18:38.140
Like I kind of found those articles a bit click baity at first.

18:38.140 --> 18:41.140
But then I remembered fucking what was that song?

18:41.140 --> 18:44.140
Man or a Muppet fucking won an Oscar.

18:44.140 --> 18:46.140
Remember that from the Muppets movie?

18:46.140 --> 18:48.140
Am I a man?

18:48.140 --> 18:50.140
Am I a Muppet?

18:50.140 --> 18:52.140
That song won the fucking Oscar.

18:52.140 --> 18:54.140
So it's possible.

18:54.140 --> 18:58.140
Like I can't sit here and say that song would never get nominated because Blame Canada was

18:58.140 --> 18:59.140
nominated.

18:59.140 --> 19:00.140
Remember that?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.140
Robin Williams sang Blame Canada that one year.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.140
That was amazing.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.140
Yep.

19:03.140 --> 19:06.140
So I would say it's more than possible.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.140
I think that Peaches song does get nominated, but we'll see.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.140
We'll see what happens.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.140
All right.

19:10.140 --> 19:12.140
But anyway, back to the Nintendo live event.

19:12.140 --> 19:15.140
There's another very important part of this that I wanted to address.

19:15.140 --> 19:18.140
And that was the fact that they're talking about tournaments.

19:18.140 --> 19:25.140
That's key to me right there because Nintendo, these last few years since pandemic lockdowns

19:25.140 --> 19:32.140
and even kind of the ramp up into before COVID disrupted everything, Nintendo was kind

19:32.140 --> 19:37.140
of infamous for shutting down and pulling Smash GameCube out of a lot of these tournaments

19:37.140 --> 19:38.140
and things.

19:38.140 --> 19:44.140
And really Evo kind of ended up not having Smash anymore because some of this Nintendo

19:44.140 --> 19:47.140
stuff and they were pushing everything through Panda.

19:47.140 --> 19:52.140
Long story short, Nintendo's really disrupted the tournament scene because supposedly they're

19:52.140 --> 19:54.140
supposed to be doing their own official thing.

19:55.140 --> 20:02.140
So this is, and I could see that maybe if Nintendo is just going full blown esports

20:02.140 --> 20:06.140
with this, this could also explain the why now for this.

20:06.140 --> 20:10.140
That they're going to set up a major Smash tournament and maybe other Nintendo games

20:10.140 --> 20:12.140
too, type of tournament with this.

20:12.140 --> 20:16.140
I would say it's their one chance to maybe get back some goodwill of all the bridges

20:16.140 --> 20:20.140
they burned by shutting down or asking these Smash tournaments to change and so forth and

20:20.140 --> 20:22.140
all the things that were going on there.

20:22.140 --> 20:26.140
This is a chance for them to, I don't know if they can get some of that goodwill back

20:26.140 --> 20:29.140
in some places, but it's a start.

20:29.140 --> 20:35.140
If this shows justification for why they've been doing what they've been doing, it would

20:35.140 --> 20:36.140
be interesting.

20:38.140 --> 20:39.140
But we'll see.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.140
So yeah, the question is, does anyone actually want to go?

20:46.140 --> 20:47.140
For me, it depends on what weekend.

20:47.140 --> 20:56.140
Ironically, there's an Ingress thing happening in Tacoma, which obviously is just, you know,

20:56.140 --> 20:58.140
it's the Sea-Tac airport up there, right?

20:58.140 --> 20:59.140
You go north, it's Seattle.

20:59.140 --> 21:00.140
You go south, it's Tacoma.

21:00.140 --> 21:02.140
Well, west-ish, but still.

21:04.140 --> 21:08.140
I was going to maybe go to an Ingress event up there, but it's the week after Dragon Con.

21:09.140 --> 21:14.140
And that's a lot of work for me because literally I'd be coming back on a Tuesday from Dragon,

21:14.140 --> 21:15.140
no, I fly on a Tuesday.

21:15.140 --> 21:19.140
I'd be coming back on a Wednesday to work, and then I'd be leaving again on a Thursday.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.140
So it's like, I might as well just take two full weeks off of work.

21:21.140 --> 21:24.140
And at that point, it's like, ooh, that's a lot of work to miss.

21:24.140 --> 21:25.140
So I don't know.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.140
We also don't know what day it is.

21:26.140 --> 21:27.140
No, we don't.

21:27.140 --> 21:28.140
We don't.

21:28.140 --> 21:32.140
I'm just saying, if it was this particular weekend, I kind of was already going to go

21:32.140 --> 21:34.140
thinking of going to Seattle anyway.

21:34.140 --> 21:37.140
This might push me over the edge to just make that happen, but we'll see.

21:38.140 --> 21:39.140
We'll see.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.140
All right.

21:41.140 --> 21:46.140
Let's move on and talk about what we have been doing this week in How Was Your Gaming

21:46.140 --> 21:47.140
Week?

21:47.140 --> 21:48.140
So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.140
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

21:50.140 --> 21:51.140
How was your gaming week?

21:51.140 --> 21:55.140
I played Dead by Daylight.

21:55.140 --> 21:58.140
I played Marvel's Midnight Suns.

21:58.140 --> 22:01.140
I've done my wordscapes.

22:01.140 --> 22:06.140
I played some Beatles today, which we are going to buy that one when we figure out how

22:06.140 --> 22:12.140
to swing that and Weird Al.

22:12.140 --> 22:18.140
And of course, I'm doing my bar stuff.

22:18.140 --> 22:24.140
It's not really a game, but I'm sort of competing with myself for it to see what I can do to

22:24.140 --> 22:25.140
get better.

22:25.140 --> 22:30.140
And I've been debating hooking back up my DDR stuff.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.140
Oh, nice.

22:31.140 --> 22:32.140
Nice.

22:33.140 --> 22:41.140
It's so funny, since I've started doing bar work and a lot of extra stretching, I hurt

22:41.140 --> 22:45.140
worse if I don't do it now.

22:45.140 --> 22:47.140
So it's easier for me.

22:47.140 --> 22:56.140
I've been actually stretching during playing games, and I'll sit with my legs in the log

22:56.140 --> 23:01.140
stack pose just to stretch while I'm playing a game.

23:01.140 --> 23:09.140
So I was actually trying to see if anyone had gamified yoga or something, apart from

23:09.140 --> 23:10.140
Wii Sports.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.140
Good question.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.140
I don't know if I've seen it.

23:13.140 --> 23:14.140
You're right.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.140
Yeah, it's funny.

23:15.140 --> 23:19.140
Wii Fit, but yes, was gamifying yoga, but yeah.

23:19.140 --> 23:23.140
I'm looking for something a little bit more my speed.

23:23.140 --> 23:28.140
No, but gamifying exercise absolutely is a very good motivator.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.140
It really worked for me.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.140
It really did.

23:30.140 --> 23:33.140
Having nothing else to do during the pandemic also helped, but you know.

23:33.140 --> 23:40.140
I'm really reluctant to play a Niantic game because I'm just not happy with what they've

23:40.140 --> 23:41.140
done.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.140
I don't blame you.

23:43.140 --> 23:44.140
I'm not going to defend them.

23:44.140 --> 23:51.140
There's not really many out there other than maybe going back to playing Orna, but I don't

23:51.140 --> 23:52.140
know.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.140
I'll think of something.

23:54.140 --> 24:00.140
I do like Orna, and I love that it's an indie, but I feel like the real world elements are

24:00.140 --> 24:01.140
secondary in that game.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.140
That's my only issue with that game.

24:04.140 --> 24:07.140
But whatever works, right?

24:07.140 --> 24:10.140
If it gets you to go to new areas, whatever works.

24:10.140 --> 24:15.140
I just more want something that's going to give me incentive to walk to a place and do

24:15.140 --> 24:18.140
something rather than drive right by the place and do something.

24:18.140 --> 24:21.140
What about geocaching?

24:21.140 --> 24:23.140
It's not technically a game.

24:23.140 --> 24:26.140
I mean, I guess it is a game, and there's a lot of apps around geocaching.

24:26.140 --> 24:27.140
I don't know.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.140
I don't know.

24:28.140 --> 24:29.140
I don't know.

24:29.140 --> 24:30.140
I thought there were either.

24:30.140 --> 24:33.140
I'm not going to use a Fitbit when I have an Apple Watch.

24:33.140 --> 24:37.140
Why would I do that?

24:37.140 --> 24:46.140
However, I have been using my workout mode on my watch to make sure I'm doing at least

24:46.140 --> 24:50.140
30 minutes, so I guess it's kind of like achievement unlocked.

24:50.140 --> 24:59.140
That's how I've kind of made a game out of it, was if I change my averages.

24:59.140 --> 25:07.140
I know I've leveled up, and my stair average went from six flights on a day on average

25:07.140 --> 25:09.140
to 11.

25:09.140 --> 25:16.140
So I'm kind of using that sort of as like, I even sometimes I'll hear the Final Fantasy

25:16.140 --> 25:22.140
fanfare in my head when something has changed on there.

25:22.140 --> 25:29.140
I've already updated my ambient calories that I burned for the day because it's more.

25:29.140 --> 25:36.140
It's been a big game for me, just like a big game.

25:36.140 --> 25:42.140
I'm going to patent that part of the idea.

25:42.140 --> 25:49.140
Then again, I think NerdFit already did it, but have achievement systems and things like

25:49.140 --> 25:53.140
that where you are gaining personal levels.

25:53.140 --> 25:57.140
It's been fun, actually.

25:57.140 --> 25:59.140
Very fun.

25:59.140 --> 26:05.140
I was sort of hoping I had a game that would fit my style of how I wanted to do this.

26:05.140 --> 26:14.140
I mean, I could go try Wii Fit again, you know, but I don't know.

26:14.140 --> 26:20.140
It felt like a little bit of work to do that when I'm already on the clock bringing out all my equipment now.

26:20.140 --> 26:25.140
Honestly, you've got to hook the Wii U back up when there's not a lot else.

26:25.140 --> 26:26.140
It's still hooked up.

26:26.140 --> 26:28.140
Oh, okay. Well, that's convenient.

26:28.140 --> 26:32.140
And the Switch, and the PS3, and the PS4.

26:32.140 --> 26:34.140
Well, right then.

26:34.140 --> 26:36.140
And I think the PSTV is as well.

26:36.140 --> 26:38.140
We had that for a hot minute.

26:38.140 --> 26:42.140
But yeah, Ring Fit Adventure wasn't so much fun for me.

26:42.140 --> 26:44.140
And I'm doing a lot more than yoga.

26:44.140 --> 26:46.140
I'm doing kettlebells.

26:46.140 --> 26:51.140
But the bar stuff is the butt kicker, literally.

26:51.140 --> 26:57.140
I know now why ballerinas are ridiculously skinny and flexible.

26:57.140 --> 27:01.140
Just getting started with some of those.

27:01.140 --> 27:06.140
Like, oh my god, plie de relevé.

27:06.140 --> 27:14.140
I'm like, my butt is going to be made out of cast iron by the end of the month.

27:14.140 --> 27:16.140
You know what a plie is, right?

27:16.140 --> 27:18.140
No. I don't.

27:18.140 --> 27:21.140
It's when you're sort of doing a squat with your feet together.

27:21.140 --> 27:26.140
And then relevé is when you're coming up on your tiptoes.

27:26.140 --> 27:31.140
Imagine going from a half squat to your tiptoes and doing that on repeat.

27:31.140 --> 27:34.140
Okay, I've seen that done, yeah.

27:34.140 --> 27:37.140
Yeah, I'm going to have...

27:37.140 --> 27:43.140
It's not going to be iron, but it's going to be something.

27:43.140 --> 27:44.140
Maybe not iron.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.140
Because that would be too magnetic.

27:46.140 --> 27:48.140
And I don't let anyone in my butt.

27:48.140 --> 27:51.140
But gamifying exercise is a good way to motivate on that.

27:51.140 --> 27:53.140
Yeah, and so that's how I'm seeing it.

27:53.140 --> 27:54.140
For me, it's a game.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.140
So I'm including it.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.140
Well, let's go to some other video games.

27:58.140 --> 28:00.140
Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:00.140 --> 28:04.140
My gaming week was filled with Minecraft again.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.140
So I had a stream day yesterday.

28:06.140 --> 28:10.140
And I streamed early in the morning.

28:10.140 --> 28:14.140
And then, of course, we had the rest of the channel, 64 people carrying out throughout the day.

28:14.140 --> 28:16.140
So that was fun. Moved some villagers around.

28:16.140 --> 28:22.140
I also went to the Capital Creative Showcase down in West Sacramento.

28:22.140 --> 28:24.140
So I got to check out some indie games there.

28:24.140 --> 28:26.140
I didn't know you went, too.

28:26.140 --> 28:29.140
I know you did because Brianna told me.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.140
I didn't know you went, too.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.140
I was just about to talk about it as well.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.140
I said it when you were talking about it earlier.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.140
No, I thought...

28:36.140 --> 28:38.140
I shouldn't know. I had to work.

28:38.140 --> 28:40.140
No, she had told me you weren't going because of the stream.

28:40.140 --> 28:41.140
And I knew you were doing the stream.

28:41.140 --> 28:43.140
I was like, oh, yeah, I was there in the morning.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.140
That's funny.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.140
Yeah, I said I tried to make it.

28:46.140 --> 28:52.140
But, yeah, it was just like it was between piano practice for the kids.

28:52.140 --> 29:01.140
It's not a wedding dinner, but it was like a dinner congratulating my sister-in-law for getting married type of thing.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.140
So it was like in between.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.140
I was like, I don't know if I have enough time to do that.

29:05.140 --> 29:07.140
But, yeah, I managed to fit it in.

29:07.140 --> 29:11.140
So, yeah, we went for like an hour and I got to play a few things.

29:11.140 --> 29:19.140
I think my favorite one, though, there had been Shellout Showdown, which is kind of a really quirky game.

29:19.140 --> 29:21.140
It's really fast paced.

29:21.140 --> 29:25.140
It's sort of a little bit like Smash Brothers in the setup that it's like a single stage.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.140
I saw that one. I know exactly which one this is. Yeah.

29:27.140 --> 29:31.140
But you play different vending machines or food carts or whatever.

29:31.140 --> 29:37.140
And the object of the game is to throw all of your food to one of the other players.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.140
Now, I can't just land on the ground.

29:39.140 --> 29:40.140
You have to pick it up if it lands on the ground.

29:40.140 --> 29:48.140
But you throw it into the inventory of another player and then you have to stay away from them for like five seconds or something to win the match.

29:48.140 --> 29:52.140
And when you do that with like a couple of players, I think it's like four player co-op.

29:52.140 --> 29:56.140
And then you can do like a bunch of CPU players as well.

29:56.140 --> 30:02.140
It gets crazy. So I had a lot of them playing that one.

30:02.140 --> 30:05.140
I don't remember. Oh, I also played what was the other one?

30:05.140 --> 30:10.140
It was the cat or a cappuccino in that cappuccino.

30:10.140 --> 30:14.140
It was the mocha mania, mocha mania.

30:14.140 --> 30:16.140
Yeah, it's on my list, too. Yeah.

30:16.140 --> 30:25.140
Yeah. So mocha mania is supposed to be like a Donkey Kong type of game with like a little there's a coffee that's like throwing coffee up into the air.

30:25.140 --> 30:30.140
And you're trying to like gather like items and stuff like that to calm the coffee down.

30:30.140 --> 30:32.140
There's like a few stages there. So that's pretty cool.

30:32.140 --> 30:39.140
I didn't know that was actually out. I don't know if you talk to the developer at all, but that one's actually out on the trailer.

30:39.140 --> 30:43.140
Yeah. So that's the trailer. It said it came out last year. So that's cool.

30:43.140 --> 30:48.140
And then there was this one game that I remember was called that was like restructure or something like that.

30:48.140 --> 30:52.140
I think it basically reboxed or something.

30:52.140 --> 31:03.140
It kind of reminded me of like a puzzle, a first person puzzle platformer game that similar to kind of like a portal or something like that, obviously without portals.

31:03.140 --> 31:07.140
And you pick up these different cubes that have different powers.

31:07.140 --> 31:10.140
So as you're holding a certain cube, you have a certain power.

31:10.140 --> 31:17.140
I was trying to figure out what was I didn't get a chance to play that game because there was always somebody on it, but it was very attractive graphically.

31:17.140 --> 31:21.140
Yeah. Yeah, it was really cool. So my kids played that and it looked pretty neat.

31:21.140 --> 31:28.140
And then I played cobalt tactics because it's my wife's friend's husband that's putting that out.

31:28.140 --> 31:32.140
So I checked it out and I broke the game immediately.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.140
It wasn't on purpose.

31:33.140 --> 31:39.140
Well, that's the interesting thing about this showcase. It's a chance for the deal because they're all mostly local.

31:39.140 --> 31:45.140
I mean, I noticed like Bay Area, but I would still call that relatively local ish, you know, all these developers and things that are.

31:45.140 --> 31:49.140
But a lot of them are getting their games in front of people for the first time.

31:49.140 --> 31:53.140
And for some, you know, because again, even events like this have been virtual for the last.

31:53.140 --> 31:58.140
This is the first year they've done this event back in person, you know, for obvious reasons.

31:58.140 --> 32:04.140
Right. And I know that they were doing a virtual event, but, you know, I was even talking to some of the developers about this.

32:04.140 --> 32:08.140
It's one thing to kind of get that feedback and everybody saying, oh, great.

32:08.140 --> 32:17.140
Yeah, looks good. You know, but then to actually see somebody playing the game and see where they struggle, see where they're thinking, see where the game's outsmarting them and all this stuff.

32:17.140 --> 32:26.140
And most importantly, you know, where they're breaking it in ways you haven't thought of is such important, valuable feedback for these folks that are making the game.

32:26.140 --> 32:28.140
So it's it goes with the territory.

32:28.140 --> 32:30.140
Yeah, no, it's fine.

32:30.140 --> 32:32.140
Yeah, it's no slight on any of the developers.

32:33.140 --> 32:35.140
Yeah, so it was interesting.

32:35.140 --> 32:41.140
It was pretty low key. We went, like I said, towards later in the afternoon, so it wasn't super crowded.

32:41.140 --> 32:46.140
But I mean, they had like, you know, I was telling Brianna, I wish you'd taken Pixel Poops number two.

32:46.140 --> 32:52.140
Yeah, I wanted to like if it was like this, just the timing wasn't good for that.

32:52.140 --> 33:00.140
But yeah, for sure. But I wanted to like a few years ago when it was they were talking maybe of being in person, but then it was digital type of thing.

33:00.140 --> 33:04.140
So but yeah, I would totally bring it because that'd be fun. I think people have a blast of that.

33:05.140 --> 33:15.140
Yeah, nice. Well, let me piggyback on that, because I also went to the Capital Creative Showcase here locally, which was so those of them that have been listening to OLR a while.

33:15.140 --> 33:17.140
So you probably have to go back definitely pre pandemic.

33:17.140 --> 33:23.140
You need to go back to the era where we were all taping in person and we would have guests in studio.

33:23.140 --> 33:29.140
And we a couple times had some guests from at the time it was the IGDA.

33:29.140 --> 33:33.140
And one of those guests was Brianna that worked with the IGDA.

33:33.140 --> 33:37.140
We've kept in touch on socials over the years. Obviously, the pandemic happened. It disrupted everything.

33:37.140 --> 33:43.140
And along the way, just for whatever reason, I don't have all the notes behind it.

33:43.140 --> 33:50.140
But, you know, creatively, the group here in Sacramento is now the Game Developers Collective, the GDC here in Sacramento.

33:50.140 --> 34:00.140
So this was their event, the Capital Creative Showcase to basically showcase what the local pool of talent in the area is making.

34:00.140 --> 34:02.140
And this is so far as like their game jams.

34:02.140 --> 34:09.140
I think one of the big things they like to do is these progressive game jams where they kind of put a group together and they've all been working on a game collectively for the last few months.

34:09.140 --> 34:17.140
And it's, you know, and as I was mentioning with Loki a minute ago, this is a great chance for them to get feedback and see people play their games live.

34:17.140 --> 34:27.140
Right. But what really impressed me too, they also had folks from like high schools and colleges and the things that people make in high school today.

34:27.140 --> 34:36.140
What? Like, yeah, but I was I was kind of reminiscing with somebody about like, OK, for and Loki, you would definitely know this one.

34:36.140 --> 34:41.140
And Jamie, you've heard us talk enough about it. That's for sure. When we were the ones in high school, it was all ZZT.

34:41.140 --> 34:44.140
That was the games we were making were in that game.

34:44.140 --> 34:48.140
It was all people programming games into their graphing calculators.

34:48.140 --> 34:50.140
Yes, graphing calculators.

34:50.140 --> 34:58.140
Or even, you know, and I kind of look back and I go, they never taught us game development school. They didn't teach us this programming stuff at school, actually.

34:58.140 --> 35:07.140
But I'm wrong. They often, so the times you would go to the computer lab and many of us associate it with like the Oregon Trail and Number Munchers back in the day.

35:07.140 --> 35:13.140
We used to do like logo and the very simple programming, the turtle program. Right.

35:13.140 --> 35:17.140
Like pan down, forward 30, right 90.

35:17.140 --> 35:21.140
You know, it's the whole thing like draw the things that was learning programming.

35:21.140 --> 35:23.140
But it's the bouncing ball that made music.

35:23.140 --> 35:30.140
Yes. But we've basic or Rocky's boots, you know, a real deep cut on learning how to program.

35:30.140 --> 35:32.140
Right. For the same people that brought you Oregon Trail.

35:32.140 --> 35:39.140
But I digress. Like, obviously, so we've had programming in school, luckily for a while now, but obviously it's not at the same.

35:39.140 --> 35:42.140
It wasn't at the same level then than it is now.

35:42.140 --> 35:47.140
And the tools that, you know, Unity and.

35:47.140 --> 35:49.140
It was funny.

35:49.140 --> 35:52.140
Yeah, Roblox. All that is bringing a table.

35:52.140 --> 36:00.140
I have a friend with her Fortran punch cards, laminated them and made lampshades out of them.

36:00.140 --> 36:05.140
Yes. And unreal. Yes, that was the one that escaped my time. Thank you Akuma JP.

36:05.140 --> 36:11.140
Pencil boxes out of three, three and a half inch floppies.

36:11.140 --> 36:13.140
Let's see. So the other game.

36:13.140 --> 36:22.140
So the one game that I saw all the ones you were talking about, Loki, the one I had on my list to shout out that you didn't shout out was a chess game that I saw.

36:22.140 --> 36:25.140
It was a twist on chess called Board of the Kings.

36:25.140 --> 36:27.140
And I was impressed by this game for two reasons.

36:27.140 --> 36:30.140
One, I believe I picked up.

36:30.140 --> 36:37.140
They are one of the progressive game jam groups who was put together by this association, and they've only been working on this for six months.

36:37.140 --> 36:43.140
And I was I was very impressed at how robust their part time to because they all they all have normal lives in this game.

36:43.140 --> 36:47.140
Game thing is part time. I was very impressed by what they put together in six months.

36:47.140 --> 36:56.140
And basically it's, you know, it's chess, but they put a little spin on it where like you can choose a power up to bring into a chess match.

36:56.140 --> 37:10.140
So the one I picked like was something like reverse polarity or polarity shift or something, which allows the bishop so many times a match to move up, down, left or right one square as opposed to diagonal.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.140
So that was a power up you could bring in.

37:12.140 --> 37:16.140
But you could also you know, you could also do a power up for your pawns.

37:16.140 --> 37:19.140
You could do a power up for it. And they had these different things they were putting out there.

37:19.140 --> 37:23.140
And they were talking about all these features they're looking at developing, you know, because, again, they've only been at it for six months.

37:23.140 --> 37:28.140
But the other thing that they did different from anyone else I saw it.

37:28.140 --> 37:31.140
I don't know if this is your experience, Loki. Again, it could be a morning versus afternoon.

37:31.140 --> 37:41.140
I'm not saying no one else did this, but it's just something that I was like, if you're an indie game developer out there and you're going to take your game to a show and get that feedback of people playing it.

37:41.140 --> 37:51.140
This is something that group did absolutely right. And that is they had one of their team members out there asking people to go play their game.

37:51.140 --> 37:57.140
Because everybody else was kind of that I saw at the moment. And again, this isn't a slide on anyone.

37:57.140 --> 38:02.140
This is just one of those like this was a this was a right move that I think a lot of folks can learn from.

38:02.140 --> 38:09.140
One thing that they did was they had the recruiter gal was, you know, going out and very much, hey, do you want to come up and play this game?

38:09.140 --> 38:15.140
Because a lot of times when you're at these expos, you see people that are kind of like, you know, on the computer.

38:15.140 --> 38:21.140
But it could be the programmer that's like trying to reset the game or they're showing something to a friend or something.

38:21.140 --> 38:33.140
You know, the thing that this person did right was they were really encouraging spectators to get in there and actually play the game and solicit that valuable feedback of a stranger playing the game.

38:33.140 --> 38:39.140
And also, you know, you never know who it's going to be like. I'm not I'm not going to toot my own horn here.

38:39.140 --> 38:43.140
I know this podcast is not that big a deal. We're not like a major influence or anything like that.

38:43.140 --> 38:51.140
But here I am now talking about that game on the program when I might not have done that had I not been cordially invited to sit down and play the game.

38:51.140 --> 38:56.140
So I just wanted to throw that out there to any potential game developer out there.

38:56.140 --> 39:01.140
If that is something that, you know, you're looking at doing is how do you get your game out there?

39:01.140 --> 39:07.140
If you aren't comfortable doing that, get a friend who is, because very obviously that team probably was like you.

39:07.140 --> 39:11.140
You're really good at getting people to do that type of stuff. You're the extrovert. You do it.

39:11.140 --> 39:17.140
And she did a great job with that. So I just want to call that out for potential other people developing their games later on.

39:17.140 --> 39:22.140
My understanding was they also were having video game tournaments and speakers during this thing in that theater.

39:22.140 --> 39:25.140
Remember the first year they did it there? We were there.

39:25.140 --> 39:31.140
Yeah. And it wasn't set up when I was there. I didn't see any of that. So I missed it.

39:31.140 --> 39:37.140
They had that tournament, but it was like over. And then we went upstairs, but there's like nothing there. So I don't know.

39:37.140 --> 39:41.140
Yeah. So it's fine. I know it was their first year back and they're still trying to get a feel for things.

39:41.140 --> 39:48.140
I noticed the back part where like the cafe was, was kind of unused too. And I'm sure in the future they'll want to use that space.

39:48.140 --> 39:53.140
But, you know, again, it's the first time back. I'm very proud of, you know, what they did put together.

39:53.140 --> 39:57.140
And I would encourage folks out there, you know, we do have listeners throughout the country and even internationally.

39:57.140 --> 40:02.140
Chances are if you're in a major city or anywhere close to a major city, somewhere in America,

40:02.140 --> 40:10.140
you probably have a collection of, or a collective of independent developers of your own who are putting on these type of shows for 10, 15 bucks.

40:10.140 --> 40:17.140
I'd really encourage you to go and check out what the locals are doing. Remember, you're not going to be playing the latest and greatest Nintendo product,

40:17.140 --> 40:22.140
but you might be seeing the next big thing. You might be looking at something where you're like,

40:22.140 --> 40:27.140
oh, that's a fun snack cart delivery fighting game. That's awesome.

40:27.140 --> 40:32.140
Yeah. You see neat ideas that you wouldn't have thought of before. It's just neat.

40:32.140 --> 40:37.140
And there's some pretty polished games there. Like some of the ones we've mentioned in the past, like Monsters of the Monocles,

40:37.140 --> 40:42.140
they had there for a few years. There is a game that came out called Black Future 88.

40:42.140 --> 40:49.140
That's just fantastic. Yeah, check it out. That one game I was playing, yeah,

40:49.140 --> 40:54.140
the Shellout Showdown is actually out on Steam right now. You can check it out. It's pretty awesome.

40:54.140 --> 40:59.140
So, and they have a free demo. Free demo is good.

40:59.140 --> 41:01.140
Yeah, lots of it, sir.

41:01.140 --> 41:05.140
Let's see, sg100matt with an excellent point here saying,

41:05.140 --> 41:11.140
I mean, Marble Madness was made with a small team that included Mark Cerny, who apparently was really young when he did it.

41:11.140 --> 41:20.140
Yeah, you never know when you might be playing the next Stardew Valley or the next Five Nights at Freddy's or the next Undertale.

41:20.140 --> 41:29.140
You know, these were all huge games created by one or maybe a very small team of people, you know.

41:29.140 --> 41:33.140
But yeah, I just it was it was it was a good show. I had a good time.

41:33.140 --> 41:36.140
There's also I also had on my list there were crafting tables I saw. I don't know.

41:36.140 --> 41:39.140
I didn't see a lot of like video game related things.

41:39.140 --> 41:44.140
I figured these were probably folks who were friends or relatives of some of the game developers who dabbled in arts and crafts.

41:44.140 --> 41:55.140
I saw some neat stuff, though, and I was actually very happy to see that like everybody was selling like LGBTQIA++, you name it, across the spec.

41:55.140 --> 42:06.140
Like all the tables I saw had whatever they were selling was like in rainbow or pan or ace or agender, trans, like what you name it was like available in those types of colors.

42:06.140 --> 42:12.140
And I just it makes me so happy for the youth today that we're embracing those types of things.

42:12.140 --> 42:16.140
The kids, they're going to be OK, but it really did.

42:16.140 --> 42:19.140
If we can keep the old people from fucking it up.

42:19.140 --> 42:22.140
That the truth. But yeah, it did warm my little heart.

42:22.140 --> 42:26.140
And yeah, so yeah, again, these are probably happening in your town somewhere.

42:26.140 --> 42:31.140
I know we can only talk about Sacramento because that's where we're based, but I'm sure these are happening in your town somewhere.

42:31.140 --> 42:34.140
Check it out. Go play a game you've never heard of.

42:34.140 --> 42:40.140
And if nothing else, you're giving a game developer feedback in one of the best possible ways.

42:40.140 --> 42:44.140
So don't go in expecting a polished demo.

42:44.140 --> 42:48.140
Things will break. But that's the point. You're there to break them and help.

42:48.140 --> 42:51.140
I remember seeing Killer Bee when it was new.

42:51.140 --> 42:52.140
Yeah.

42:52.140 --> 42:54.140
Was it gamer X, wasn't it?

42:54.140 --> 42:55.140
Mm hmm.

42:55.140 --> 42:58.140
Yeah. And then now they're freaking everywhere.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.140
Yeah. Killer Queen, I think, is that one, right?

43:00.140 --> 43:01.140
Yeah. Yeah.

43:01.140 --> 43:07.140
Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says you also might meet people who get big in the industry later.

43:07.140 --> 43:16.140
There was someone at our local indie game stuff that sounds a lot like this who then became one of the narrative designer leads for this little game called Diablo four.

43:16.140 --> 43:18.140
Right. Why are these folks passionate about what they do?

43:18.140 --> 43:23.140
Many of them want to turn it into careers, especially those that are coming from the high school and college.

43:23.140 --> 43:26.140
You don't know who you might be meeting.

43:26.140 --> 43:27.140
Yeah.

43:27.140 --> 43:29.140
Quest Buster. Excellent point here.

43:29.140 --> 43:36.140
Richard Garriott, aka Lord British, was still in high school when he created Akalabeth.

43:36.140 --> 43:44.140
I think I'm saying that right. In basic, which eventually, of course, led to Ultima and, you know, the games that he got very famous for later on.

43:44.140 --> 43:45.140
So very good point.

43:45.140 --> 44:01.140
The folks who are responsible for bringing us Star Fox originally, you know, they they started off by doing something that no one thought could be done, which was bypassing Nintendo's

44:01.140 --> 44:07.140
lock and making their own Game Boy dev kit and then running 3D on a Game Boy.

44:07.140 --> 44:09.140
Yeah. Yeah.

44:09.140 --> 44:20.140
You know, you never know. And for anyone who, you know, plays in, you know, indie games or might have developed like a little thing here and there, bring it on.

44:20.140 --> 44:22.140
You don't know who you will be.

44:22.140 --> 44:26.140
Yeah. Anyway, I would invite you know, I need to make it.

44:26.140 --> 44:36.140
Now that we're coming back in person again, I need to make a note to hold an ear to the wall a little more at what some of these folks are doing, because I'd be happy to have many of them on the show.

44:36.140 --> 44:45.140
When they have a product ready for the masses, because obviously we can't really promote something that, you know, our listenership can't really do anything about.

44:45.140 --> 44:51.140
But like you mentioned, Loki, a lot of these games you were checking out are available on Steam or itch.io and so forth.

44:51.140 --> 44:55.140
So, you know, why not? I love to support the indie folks.

44:55.140 --> 45:01.140
We've we've hyped up enough of our indie friends of our own between, you know, YYR and everything that he's been doing.

45:01.140 --> 45:09.140
Pixel Poop is number two. We, you know, we all know people that are making games and we want to we want to help them out, you know, especially when the games are something we're all very proud of.

45:09.140 --> 45:16.140
So. All right. So props to the SAC Dev Collective and the Capital Creative Showcase.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.140
I wish I could have stayed the whole day. What's that?

45:19.140 --> 45:20.140
I wish I could have gone.

45:20.140 --> 45:30.140
Yeah. Next year. Next year. We'll know next year a little more advanced notice probably that it's, you know, because I want to say when they were doing it before, it was around the tax weekend is kind of what I call this weekend.

45:30.140 --> 45:36.140
It was around tax or I guess I should say Jamie's birthday week. It was around Jamie's birthday week every year.

45:36.140 --> 45:40.140
And really, I'm just waiting for someone to make a game of me.

45:40.140 --> 45:49.140
Well, I mean, you got your dream games, Jamie. YYR made Bungie Verit tossing a reality. So I get a little greedy over there.

45:49.140 --> 46:04.140
I need to star in a game. I think that I now in my in my not Twilight years have earned my place where we need Orange Nails Radio the game.

46:04.140 --> 46:08.140
What would you we had Orange Nails Radio the game somebody made a text adventure way back in the day. Remember?

46:08.140 --> 46:17.140
I'm meaning I mean that we have to have like a full on RPG.

46:17.140 --> 46:23.140
Where we have to battle obscurity and bills.

46:23.140 --> 46:29.140
What would happen in your game? What would happen? What would your superpower be in the Jamie video game?

46:29.140 --> 46:30.140
Spite.

46:30.140 --> 46:31.140
Spite?

46:31.140 --> 46:36.140
Spite.

46:36.140 --> 46:38.140
I would I would have the power of spite.

46:38.140 --> 46:39.140
It's a powerful thing.

46:39.140 --> 46:44.140
Where I could do where I could do something someone said I couldn't do.

46:44.140 --> 46:53.140
I will point this out, like in all seriousness, you know, something that I'm constantly reminded, I thought we were done with this topic, but we're not.

46:53.140 --> 46:59.140
And that's but that's OK, because this is this is a positive. This is truly a net positive talking about this local and indie game development.

46:59.140 --> 47:13.140
One thing that I often forget is that even if you're not interested in programming or you don't think you can program or you don't want to program, there's still probably a space in game development for you somewhere.

47:14.140 --> 47:18.140
Built into Epic or into Unreal and into Unity.

47:18.140 --> 47:21.140
That's block based coding that you can do.

47:21.140 --> 47:23.140
You don't even need to know programming language.

47:23.140 --> 47:24.140
You can do that.

47:24.140 --> 47:25.140
Yes.

47:25.140 --> 47:30.140
I'm thinking about I'm thinking about Dark Sakura does music.

47:30.140 --> 47:31.140
She creates music for her streams.

47:31.140 --> 47:32.140
Right.

47:32.140 --> 47:35.140
And I was overhearing the conversation.

47:35.140 --> 47:40.140
I was overhearing conversation for one of the game developers about outsourced music that they were doing for their game.

47:40.140 --> 47:44.140
And I was like, oh, you know, they got to do what they got to do to get what they need for their game.

47:44.140 --> 47:57.140
But, you know, it just kind of shows like, oh, maybe if they were able to connect with some local musicians who might I'm not saying I'm not volunteering Dark Sakura for that, but I'm using her as an example of you might not know where the musical talent is around here locally.

47:57.140 --> 48:09.140
So even folks who aren't necessarily interested in the programing, if you're interested in art, if you're interested in hell, just testing, for God's sake, writing your story goes into this.

48:09.140 --> 48:16.140
I know this is something the chess game was working on is that they're going to be making a whole narrative around it and all that, which I don't want to keep calling it the chess game.

48:16.140 --> 48:18.140
I want to I want to give it its its real do.

48:18.140 --> 48:23.140
I know they were RP Chess on Twitter was their handle.

48:23.140 --> 48:33.140
But this was there's there's room for all sorts of different creative stuff within game development.

48:33.140 --> 48:39.140
To work with people and and make like, I mean, I'm not good for more than just little little loops.

48:39.140 --> 48:46.140
You know, that's kind of my jam and some like I have a MIDI keyboard, but I can't play piano.

48:46.140 --> 48:54.140
But I can type out a rhythm and then go into Logic Pro and adjust the MIDI to be the right notes and velocity and whatnot.

48:54.140 --> 49:00.140
So, I mean, and I I've done plenty of creative writing.

49:00.140 --> 49:04.140
You know, I would love to come up with a concept and have somebody execute it for me.

49:04.140 --> 49:08.140
All right. Now, now it's out there in the universe.

49:08.140 --> 49:10.140
All right. Well, let's move on for now.

49:10.140 --> 49:12.140
We've got to speak in the industry.

49:12.140 --> 49:17.140
We've got to talk about what's going on in the larger worldwide game industry with the week's news.

49:17.140 --> 49:19.140
We've had a lot of things going on this week.

49:19.140 --> 49:25.140
So let's get to Loki continuing on with another Nintendo story, right?

49:25.140 --> 49:39.140
Yep. So we talked last week how Nintendo was coming after Point Crow for the Zelda Breath of the Wild mods that he was showcasing, the multiplayer mod.

49:39.140 --> 49:48.140
Now they're coming after his channel for any mods he has, because he's done a lot of different mods for Breath of the Wild and other games.

49:48.140 --> 49:52.140
And they have been copyright claiming all of them.

49:52.140 --> 49:56.140
Somebody stocked the kitchen at Nintendo with lots of petty crocker.

49:56.140 --> 49:59.140
Even stuff that has nothing to do with modified gameplay.

49:59.140 --> 50:04.140
It just may sound like it's modded. Then they're claiming that as well, which I don't think that's right.

50:04.140 --> 50:12.140
But yeah, so they, of course, Point Crow put out a video or put out a video about the whole situation as well.

50:12.140 --> 50:18.140
And also tweeted that just put out a video going over the takedowns that Nintendo of America has issued on my YouTube channel.

50:18.140 --> 50:21.140
Please go give it a watch. It's incredibly important.

50:21.140 --> 50:30.140
And he also asked for, you know, please remove these strikes and claims or at least start a dialogue with us so we can all move forward with excitement.

50:30.140 --> 50:32.140
I'm sure you'd love to see that about your now that lawyers don't care.

50:32.140 --> 50:37.140
I mean, honestly, like they're just going to make all the bad decisions that they want.

50:38.140 --> 50:40.140
There's another content creator as well.

50:40.140 --> 50:48.140
Croton, who has they said Nintendo's new 10 of my streams and two of my videos off the face of the platform.

50:48.140 --> 50:51.140
No answer, no context, just copyright removal.

50:51.140 --> 50:54.140
And one of these videos has literally nothing to do with mods.

50:54.140 --> 50:58.140
It's a simply Zelda challenge run.

50:58.140 --> 51:03.140
So, yeah, some intern somewhere is flagging these without watching them, apparently, too.

51:03.140 --> 51:14.140
So that that great use of our copyright system that it can be weaponized like this by companies and corporations because they have lawyers and they can do that kind of stuff.

51:14.140 --> 51:17.140
So that's fun thing.

51:17.140 --> 51:20.140
And to go along with that, a completely different story.

51:20.140 --> 51:29.140
You may remember there was that whole art book that leaked for Tears of a Kingdom, and apparently it came from a Discord channel.

51:29.140 --> 51:38.140
And so now Nintendo has decided to subpoena Discord to try to identify the person who leaked the information.

51:38.140 --> 51:41.140
Discord's not having a good week in the leaks department, are they?

51:41.140 --> 51:42.140
They are not.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.140
But I think this is the minor of the two.

51:44.140 --> 51:48.140
They're well within their rights on something like this.

51:48.140 --> 51:51.140
I mean, I can't fault them for that.

51:51.140 --> 51:53.140
It's just ridiculous.

51:53.140 --> 51:55.140
I mean, like, yeah, I get it like that.

51:55.140 --> 51:56.140
They can come.

51:56.140 --> 52:02.140
But like, what harm did it really do aside from like, I don't know, it's just silly, but whatever.

52:02.140 --> 52:09.140
How many people who would have bought that book aren't buying it now because it's out there for free?

52:09.140 --> 52:11.140
It would depend on the quality.

52:11.140 --> 52:16.140
It was an art book that was part of a collector's edition, I think.

52:16.140 --> 52:24.140
Well, on top of that, too, you know, if you've got the artwork for it, what incentive are you going to have to pay the extra money to get the collector's edition?

52:24.140 --> 52:26.140
How do people buy collector's editions?

52:26.140 --> 52:29.140
I think people would have bought the collector's edition even if the art book leaked.

52:29.140 --> 52:31.140
I mean, they still are, obviously.

52:31.140 --> 52:34.140
No one's canceling because they're like, oh, I've seen all the artwork now.

52:34.140 --> 52:35.140
I mean, you're going to play the game.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.140
You're going to see all the artwork anyways.

52:36.140 --> 52:47.140
I would agree Nintendo's within their rights to do what they need to do here because this is a little more of a straight up copyright crime, whereas the other one I'm not on their side with.

52:47.140 --> 52:49.140
The mods and that stuff.

52:50.140 --> 53:12.140
But for for artwork, especially as an artist myself, you know, if any of my work that I had intended on putting out there to make money with was, you know, being traded without my permission, then, yeah, I'd go, you know, do anything that I could to get it back.

53:12.140 --> 53:17.140
I mean, prevent other people from, you know, taking it outside of its intended use.

53:17.140 --> 53:31.140
For sure. And I get that. And we just have to see where it leaked from because if it was from a retailer, which to my question of you, like, why are you shipping the art books that damn early? Like, that doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

53:31.140 --> 53:39.140
And I do understand that is that how much of this is Nintendo's own kind of carelessness, right?

53:39.140 --> 54:01.140
I mean, it could be a printer or something, I would think that's pretty easy to track at that point. Yeah, who, who leaked it? It's not like, Oh, I don't know who leaked it. Like, like, you have a chain of custody for that kind of stuff, you know, okay, well, you know, obviously, they're not shipping the art book, like months early. That's not a thing that happens.

54:01.140 --> 54:22.140
So it, it would be interesting to see, like, I mean, sure, yeah, we could get down to like, figure out who exactly did it. But like, I don't know, I don't think you even need the subpoena discord for it. But sure. I mean, subpoena, whatever. I mean, you'll have the IP, I guess, and their email address, probably the name, maybe.

54:23.140 --> 54:43.140
Well, it is worth pointing out that there was also, you know, kind of, I guess the final Tears of the Kingdom trailer or, you know, latest major trailer for the game that also released this week that shows a little bit of voice acting out. It was a really good trailer, I gotta say I was a little like kind of thrown like, Whoa, Zelda's actually voice acted. That's

54:43.140 --> 54:45.140
I mean, the last one was too.

54:45.140 --> 54:51.140
I just don't I don't mind. It's been so long as I played that game. I don't even remember it. Like I'm so used to Nintendo not doing that. You know what I mean?

54:51.140 --> 54:52.140
Blood moon rises.

54:52.140 --> 54:53.140
Yeah, that's right.

54:53.140 --> 55:00.140
Yeah, there was plenty of dialogue in that game. There was the the king and there was Yeah.

55:01.140 --> 55:10.140
It was impressive to see, you know, Chris Pratt really take on the role of Princess Zelda. I wouldn't think he had it in him. But like, I was very impressed by that.

55:10.140 --> 55:33.140
I liked the memes I started seeing on Twitter right after that, that were things like me whenever I scan a QR code, and it's just the little video where the Zelda's going link. I don't know, things like that are really funny to me. Maybe I'm just entering my full dad era, but whatever. All right.

55:34.140 --> 55:46.140
One of my favorite YouTubers, Zeltik, did a full breakdown. But I had to leave feedback on it because he was confusing the concept of a gachapon and a pachinko machine.

55:47.140 --> 55:55.140
As like, the little things full of balls. There's not pachinko. Those are gachapon. Get it right, dude.

55:57.140 --> 55:58.140
All right.

55:58.140 --> 55:59.140
Yeah.

55:59.140 --> 56:15.140
Well, Zelda was not the only game to get a deep dive trailer this week. We also had the latest Final Fantasy 16. So PlayStation actually did an entire state of play for Final Fantasy 16.

56:16.140 --> 56:32.140
And they were actually showing the latest and greatest going on in this game, which includes a deep dive on how some of the icon battles would work in this game, which really looked like they were doing some different types of genres really within this.

56:32.140 --> 56:41.140
One of the frickin' icon that's basically summons, one of the fights in that really looked like Rez or something was like the game you were playing there.

56:42.140 --> 56:48.140
So I'm very curious how diverse and how interesting these types of mini games are that they put in there.

56:49.140 --> 56:59.140
So yeah, they talked also a little bit about Clive's Hideout, which was supposed to be the base camp that's in the game that showed the footage, you know, about preparing for upcoming battles.

56:59.140 --> 57:04.140
It had a little crafting system or training. There was like a training system that was in there as well.

57:04.140 --> 57:11.140
It's confirmed that the hunt board, you might remember that from Final Fantasy 12. It was in various other games. There's a version of it in 14 as well.

57:11.140 --> 57:15.140
The hunt board is back and you can hunt mobs in the game as well.

57:16.140 --> 57:26.140
They talked a little bit again about some of the combat changes and the accessories that you can equip to make combat a little bit easier if you need it.

57:26.140 --> 57:39.140
And again, I think this was cleared up a couple weeks ago, but if you missed it, the reason why you have five items and three slots is because some of the items you have like a stronger version.

57:39.140 --> 57:48.140
So you don't need more than three slots because like, for example, one item slows down the dodge rate so that it makes dodges a little more accessible.

57:48.140 --> 57:52.140
The other one removes dodging altogether. So there's no need to have both equipped.

57:52.140 --> 57:58.140
So just because that was the thing that came out when that was first announced is why can you only equip some of them? Well, that's why.

57:58.140 --> 58:02.140
So just make it a menu instead of like an equipped. I don't know. It seems like ridiculous.

58:03.140 --> 58:13.140
I'm OK with it. I like that they did it so that the interface actually says right there, very tiny in the corner, if you're using those types of mods or not.

58:13.140 --> 58:24.140
So people that are like, you know, watching your stream and what have you can kind of know exactly like, you know, if you're actually using those mods or not, because those icons light up that show the various mods.

58:24.140 --> 58:35.140
I thought that was kind of interesting. So what they didn't really get into much was more of like kind of the role play elements, which they said they were going to do in April at some point.

58:35.140 --> 58:48.140
I didn't really get a sense a lot of that with the story and everything. Apparently, there's also supposed to be some type of end game mechanic, which is interesting because I don't usually think of an end game loop and Final Fantasy games that are not MMOs.

58:48.140 --> 58:55.140
So I'm very curious what that's going to entail in this game. And apparently we're going to get a deep dive on that a little bit later on as well.

58:55.140 --> 58:57.140
So bringing the weapons back.

58:57.140 --> 59:04.140
Yeah, I mean, I guess that was an end game grind and things like Final Fantasy 7, like Emerald Weapon and stuff. But yeah, I mean,

59:04.140 --> 59:06.140
What do you mean end game? I did that halfway through the damn game.

59:06.140 --> 59:12.140
I was already sold on this game anyway the minute I heard that Creative Business Unit 3 was making it.

59:12.140 --> 59:20.140
But this just definitely I was like, OK, yeah, this looks great. I cannot wait to check this game out. Absolutely, absolutely.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.140
But Rob, they can't make it diverse.

59:22.140 --> 59:32.140
That's a problem. I mean, it is it is absolutely a problem. And, you know, I kind of went into I think it's a sign of a bigger problem.

59:32.140 --> 59:40.140
But the way that certainly this that issue was responded to was not done well. And I got nothing. That's all I can say on that.

59:40.140 --> 59:46.140
They they should. Yes, they needed to answer that question a lot better. And yeah, so.

59:46.140 --> 59:49.140
Yeah, I kind of have no interest in it because of that.

59:49.140 --> 59:56.140
I was hoping that they might have some more diverse voice actors, but they haven't really announced who they are yet.

59:56.140 --> 01:00:04.140
Some people are figuring it out based on some of the clips that we've seen, but I don't believe we've had the official announcements as of just yet.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:10.140
So we'll wait on that, I guess. I could be wrong, though.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:17.140
Let's see. Other comments in chat. Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm hoping the color palette gets a bit lighter.

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.140
I'm tired of drab gray medieval settings. That's why I didn't get Stranger at Paradise.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:25.140
So I don't know. I actually Stranger at Paradise.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:30.140
I really like the demo. Stranger at Paradise I didn't want to pay full price for. I think it's down to 40.

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.140
I'll probably get it when it comes down a little bit cheaper, but we'll see.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:39.140
So I don't know how I feel about it still.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:47.140
You know, I I'll be honest, I haven't been really excited about a Final Fantasy game in a long time.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:55.140
Like, not even the seven remake, 15 was completely unappealing to me because, I mean, I just saw a lot of bro dudes.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:00.140
No, there was there was nothing really that appealed to me yet.

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:08.140
I think that the the series has lost some charm.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.140
It really it really has to me.

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.140
I didn't love 15, but I didn't think it was the worst.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:23.140
But I think I think it was kind of a mistake to pivot that the way that they did ever in the first place anyway.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:29.140
But it is what it is. This game to me looks like it's going to be better than 15, which isn't a high bar.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:35.140
But I have faith it's going to probably be a solid middle of the pack Final Fantasy game.

01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:39.140
And, you know, I I always get into these games from the pixel remasters.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.140
The old games are finally coming out on PlayStation Switch this week, actually.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.140
So that's also very exciting. I'm excited to revisit a lot of those classics.

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:54.140
So I think that's all I want to say about that for now.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.140
I'm sure we'll see more teasers for that game because that game's only two months away.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:01.140
It's wild to think that we've got some big stuff coming up.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.140
But yeah, summer's almost upon us. All right.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:12.140
Moving on, Dark Sakura. So back to the Sony dramas and a U.S.

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:17.140
senator who is big surprise Republican.

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:23.140
Send a letter to Sony actually directly to the CEO Yoshida Kinichiro, quote,

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:30.140
regarding its anti-competitive behavior and to request information on the company's acquisition agreements.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:41.140
So basically some of the quotes on here is he wanted to express concern about Sony's efforts to protect its gaming console business from competition.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:52.140
And then, quote, I am concerned Sony's dominance of that market and its efforts to perpetuate its current position imperils an important economic development opportunity for North Dakota.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:57.140
He's the North Dakota Republican dude.

01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:08.140
And so the things that he's requested are for unredacted copies of all agreements that give Sony an exclusive right to distribute a third party game.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:15.140
All agreements between Sony and third party publishers that prevent them from releasing their games on other systems.

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:22.140
All internal company documents describing the strategic rationale for Sony's decision to acquire Bungie.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:29.140
All correspondence with the U.S. government or regulatory agencies relating to video game competition.

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.140
And I mean, he's just one more out of.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:48.140
I mean, there were there were four other Republicans and six other Democrats that were accusing Sony of deliberately making exclusivity deals with third party publishers to make sure that Microsoft doesn't get a foothold in Japan.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:54.140
I will go ahead and say that I don't think many people were very interested in Xbox anyway.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.140
That has nothing to do with it, but whatever.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:10.140
There are also letters that asked U.S. trade representative Catherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo to raise the issue with Japan when they go for trade talks.

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:20.140
But that basically the claim is that it's putting Microsoft at a disadvantage.

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.140
So I don't know.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:26.140
But that's that's one of the big ones lately.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:34.140
But I mean, keep in mind that corporations work quite a bit differently there than here.

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:44.140
And they may have a completely legal like it may be perfectly legal there.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.140
I mean, I don't know what.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:55.140
I don't know what we can do about practices in Japan.

01:04:55.140 --> 01:05:04.140
Yeah, no, totally. It is it is very strange, but it's also it's also so weird on the heels of how much Sony has been coming out after Microsoft.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:10.140
It's so weird because it almost seems like that has been what's had the effect of suddenly now retaliation is what it is.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:22.140
It is odd. But, you know, it's also, you know, last time or the last couple of weeks we brought this up that, you know, Congress was getting it was the senator from Washington who is getting campaign donations from Microsoft.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:28.140
But now you're talking about comments from a senator in North Dakota, not exactly known for its tech industry.

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.140
So it's interesting that it's kind of spreading.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:35.140
But yeah, I wonder what lobbies have contacted him.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.140
Yeah, yeah, true. I'm sure.

01:05:37.140 --> 01:05:39.140
But I follow the money.

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:44.140
I just. Yeah. What are they going to be able to do about things in Japan?

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:53.140
But I on one hand, I'm going to say that I think a lot of the ways Sony has been attacking the Microsoft merger has been bullshit.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:06:01.140
And I think in some ways, yeah, this is a little bit retaliation for that is like, hey, not everything you're doing is pretty cute either.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:10.140
So on the one hand, the only thing that kind of encourages me about this is I'm like, oh, that Activision Blizzard Microsoft merger is almost sure to go through.

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:14.140
And look, say what you will about that deal. I understand.

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:21.140
If there's no place for Bobby Kotick in the future of Microsoft after this merger, I am fully supportive of it.

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:27.140
That is that is priority number one, priority number one in the gaming industry right now.

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:32.140
Remove Bobby Kotick. That should be priority number one in the entire industry.

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:38.140
Going back to what Ikuma says, Ikuma JP in chat.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:44.140
Now, Japan sales are low because Microsoft kills the product too soon.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:53.140
It does make me think of Scalebound. You know, that was supposed to be the big, you know, one of the big titles for Microsoft that, you know, was going to be the Platinum Games was involved that.

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:56.140
And then it just kind of was quietly killed in the middle of the night.

01:06:56.140 --> 01:07:03.140
Yeah, well, and the other thing, too, like I said, you know, like, for example, we have a business.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:12.140
Well, one of the business laws is that a company like stays more specialized within its its department.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:19.140
Like, for example, when we think Mitsubishi over here, what do we think of?

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.140
The car.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:24.140
Yeah, but they also make aluminum siding and pencils.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.140
OK, I get you.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:36.140
So over here, well, actually, I think in general now is that like a lot of their art supplies are under a different name, but it's all going back to the same place.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:43.140
It's just, you know, the legalities are are just they're they're different.

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:48.140
Ikuma JP kind of continuing that analogy, saying like, if Google made a new app, would you use it?

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:51.140
You know, it'll die as soon as you get used to it.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:08:04.140
Kind of like I guess Microsoft has a similar reputation over there, that Google is really cementing for itself here after what happened with Stadia, quite honestly, among a variety of other Google products over the years.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.140
Well, I have to for this.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.140
So no, I know.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:14.140
And honestly, though, I'm kind of glad because I like GeForce better.

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:21.140
All right. Well, sadly, one game you won't be playing on GeForce is our next topic because it's going to be ending.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.140
Right, Logie? Not GeForce, but this game.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.140
Yes.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:33.140
So unfortunately, the kind of really awesome media molecule sandbox game Dreams is coming to an end.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:49.140
So it came out four years ago on the PlayStation four, and they're going to be ending live support for Dreams on September 1st because the team is moving on to an exciting new project.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.140
Well, at least that's good.

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:58.140
So with that says, we know this won't be an easy message for everyone here and certainly not been an easy decision.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:15.140
Dreams has been a special project for Media Molecule and helping this community of game developers, tinkerers, creatives and collaborators and dreamers grow and express themselves remains one of the best things we've ever done.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:29.140
Thank you for being a part of it with us, and we look forward and join us in our next adventure and basically said that there was not a sustainable path for Dreams, and they had to make the decision to change the product strategy.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:46.140
I think you could still play the game offline, though, but yeah, right now it's they're going to be dropping the storage limit, I guess, online to five gigabytes and one gigabyte locally.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:59.140
Hmm, I know this game definitely had like its fan base of people and you know, the types of things that they were making it this is very rich, robust type of you know, development system, especially for console.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:13.140
So I mean, seeing it and like, you know, obviously a lot of these online games and eventually, but I guess maybe it's a little bit surprising because I still feel like many people were discovering this through the PlayStation five and that sort of thing.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.140
So I'm just I'm a little bit.

01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:22.140
It seems early, I don't know, but maybe the game didn't get as big as they hope, but I think I think they launched it weird.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.140
I don't think they ever marketed it appropriately.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.140
Mark, it was such a niche thing.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:35.140
Like, I think there was a lot of sloppy things on the discovery front that they could have done a lot better, quite honestly.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.140
I mean, there's a lot that they've done.

01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:42.140
Like, I think like people were even like taking like little big planet and doing crazy things with that as well.

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:51.140
So like, yeah, I think that they probably need the market to better at least like maybe showcase some of the things that people are making that were really cool.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:55.140
I'm sure some of it is like, you know, kind of skirting copyright a bit.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:02.140
But, you know, it still would have been interesting to see, you know, something like, hey, look at this cool game that someone made.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:07.140
Like it's a first person shooter or hey, this is a racing game. It's amazing looking, you know, some of that stuff.

01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:10.140
But it's pretty quiet. I mean.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:22.140
I think I feel like they were relying on the social media and the media to highlight a lot of those things for them when a lot of those, you know, unique things would come out.

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:31.140
But you're right, that stuff that would gain that type of traction was almost always skirting the copyright line or just blatantly passing it.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:38.140
Yeah. So there were some like really cool things that were just like, you know, recreations of like some of the stuff that you could do.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:44.140
Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Yeah. It's. It's unfortunate, I guess.

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:50.140
Yeah. I guess it also feels like a bummer because there's not really a successor in this arena because, you know, we know of yet.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:12:00.140
Yeah, there could be something in the future. Who knows? But, you know, the last little big planet game they made was that Sackboy Big Adventure, which, by the way, just went on PlayStation Plus.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:11.140
So if you haven't checked it out yet and you have that, it's worth looking at. I played a little bit of it, but it's not LittleBigPlanet like with the creator mode in it, though.

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:20.140
But it's, you know, it's kind of like imagining what might LittleBigPlanet look like in 3D, but there's no creation mode. It's just here's what the single player campaign might look like.

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.140
Yeah.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:35.140
Yeah. So that's interesting. All right. Well, talking about games that just came out this last week, this one, I wish I had enough time to play everything because I'd like to check this game out.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:44.140
And that's Tron Identity. Tron Identity came out on the Switch this past week on April 11th. The developer of the game was Biffle Games.

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:56.140
That is the only game that we know that they're working on for now. But there was an internal Disney interview. This was from D23. That's why they call it an internal Disney interview.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:04.140
They talked to Tron Identity producer Heidi Vargas. Now, there's no specifics, but there is this very interesting quote.

01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:16.140
Tron Identity is the start of Biffle Games collaboration with Disney on Tron dedicated games. Players can expect more Tron titles to come in the future. So perhaps...

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.140
There's another movie.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:24.140
Well, I wish they would. That movie's been stop and go for forever. Yeah.

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:37.140
I know. But well, but now, you know, at least to Disney's credit, at least they finally opened that ride. Had a, I think had a soft opening at Disney World because I know I've had friends that have been on it.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:45.140
So it's it's so because Tron's in the parks now, they do have an interest because that means merchandising, merchandising, right?

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:54.140
So they have an interest in bringing Tron back up to the front and trying to get some of that sweet merchandise that goes with the gift shop as you exit the ride. Right.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:14:09.140
Which, heaven help me the day I walk in there. Heaven help my ass the day I ride that ride and walk into the gift shop when I disembark the ride. Like, yikes.

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:17.140
And you you both are screwed, too, and you know it. That's why that's that's why we've got to stay the hell out of Florida for a multitude of reasons.

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.140
But that that is. Yeah.

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:26.140
Bought Tron merch at Disneyland this last year, so. Yeah.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:31.140
Looney Bard says your ass will thank you since your wallet will take over.

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:36.140
And I guess it's all in the card now as to what Matt says. Yeah, I want that Tron merch.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:43.140
Yep. Bobby Blackwell said the official open to the ride was April 4th. So there it is. The ride is officially official now. So.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:48.140
I think I have a pin trading pin from Shanghai for the Tron ride.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.140
Oh, nice. Nice. Someone sent me.

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:59.140
All right. Well, let's go to Dark Soccer for our next story. A very different type of note, but an interesting little aside.

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:09.140
Just, you know, I love little like people stories, I guess. And so there's an online jigsaw site called I'm a Puzzle.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:16.140
They analyzed gaming related search terms to find the state that had the most interest in video games.

01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:27.140
And apparently it was Nevada that took the top spot at seven thousand six hundred and fifty eight average monthly gaming related searches per one hundred thousand population.

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:36.140
So the most search terms in the state were PS5, Steam and Nintendo Switch. Right before them were Georgia and New York.

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:41.140
The least interested was Hawaii.

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:47.140
I guess when the weather's beautiful, it's in Hawaii all the time.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:54.140
Of course, this was the same one that I showed you the story man arrested after gun found in quesadilla.

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.140
And I'm like, are you trying to show up, Florida?

01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:02.140
Yeah. And I believe my response was what I what is Chipotle putting in their stuff now?

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.140
I know they put a variety of strange things in there sometimes, but my gosh.

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:08.140
But at any rate.

01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:11.140
Yeah, I can imagine.

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:20.140
There's a lot of very remote parts of Nevada, so not to say it's the only state that has a lot of remote parts, because most of the people live, you know, obviously does Las Vegas.

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:26.140
Yeah, sure. Any state, I guess, does Las Vegas, Henderson or Reno, Truckee, Carson City.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:31.140
Those are kind of like your big populated areas in Nevada, but the rest that's a big state.

01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:38.140
So I can see why people because it gets it gets very hot in Nevada and the weather's not nearly what Hawaii gets for weather.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:42.140
So I can see why people stay inside and play video games, for sure. But it is it is interesting.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:48.140
I would have thought California are one of the more, you know, tech embracing states.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:58.140
Hawaii has also been having a big problem with unemployment. I'm just going to throw that out there with just some of the changes going on.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:02.140
I was actually watching a documentary about it not long ago.

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:12.140
So but it's also a mostly a lot of the commerce is from the tourist industry.

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.140
Sure.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:25.140
So, I mean, yeah, people want to play games, but that's not, I think, the source of attention for for, you know, the majority, at least of the more highly populated areas.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:29.140
Well, and then the effect that pandemic lockdowns had on all that tourism, you know.

01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:30.140
They had it bad.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:41.140
Yeah, of course. Yeah. So I remember Hawaii kind of had to come up with their own sort of system to try to get people to come back like, you know, the tourist rules there and they were doing what they could do.

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:45.140
So it's yeah, but.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:53.140
All right. But I mean, when you're when you're an island, you're going to have a harder time managing, you know, treading water like that.

01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:55.140
Yeah, for sure.

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.140
All right. Well, let's move on.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.140
Logie.

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.140
All right. So this is interesting.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:09.140
We talked about a little bit how Nintendo is cracking down on people using their IP for things.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:22.140
Well, now it's kind of the reverse. So we have Bethesda and all the scrolls online, kind of stealing someone's fan art and using it in game.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:28.140
So there was a there was a character skin called Mercy Mother's Body Art.

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:48.140
And if you look at the skin, you can see that the face and the head have basically the artwork from this guy, Dave, who had his basically artwork stolen from I don't remember which site it was on, but DeviantArt maybe or something like that.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:54.140
And oh, no, it was on his Tumblr. OK, so he had that appear in game.

01:18:54.140 --> 01:19:07.140
And then, of course, you know, the old scrolls online or Bethesda came out on their Twitter accounts that we are aware of the situation with the ESO fan art or fan artists.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:11.140
It was never our intention to include any community fan art without proper credit.

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:16.140
We were in contact with the artists and we'll work with them to make sure that there is a proper resolution.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:21.140
So funny how like, you know, that they decide that they're oh, we're going to work it out, we're going to work it out.

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:27.140
But when it when it comes to like, like, say, if I'm making something with Bethesda's IP, oh, they're going to send the lawyers.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:35.140
So, so interesting that they're willing to settle it with the fans, you know, amicably if it's their bad.

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:38.140
But like, if it's anybody else, let's just send the lawyers after them.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.140
So weird how that works in the corporate world.

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:47.140
And then some places just like, OK, we'll just pay you off and that's it.

01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:58.140
And it sucks because there's no one out there to really represent the little creators out there, for lack of a better term, when we know that, you know, all of these big video game companies tend to be extremely litigious.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:06.140
You know, it does really suck about our legal system is that who's advocating for the little guy in these situations?

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:13.140
And there are companies out there who just make their habit of it, like, for example, Dolls Kill.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:19.140
They have stolen artwork, they've stolen products from independent makers.

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:23.140
That's why I don't give them any fucking money.

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:33.140
There also is, you know, like I like I don't know if I ever told you about my my friend in Australia.

01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:45.140
We were both Homestuck fans and I was wandering around in this Russian grocery store out in Citrus Heights by the Eco Thrift.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:56.140
And I happened to see Homestuck artwork, clearly fan art, on the front page of a Russian publication.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:04.140
So I took it and image searched and I found her and I said, I found your artwork being used by this company.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:10.140
She's like, yeah, someone else has told me, but I sent her the book so she could have it.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.140
And we've been friends ever since.

01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:17.140
Yeah, but but at any rate, she's got a cute kiddo.

01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:23.140
But at any rate, though, it's just it's not isolated to the video game industry.

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.140
The movie industry does it all the time.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:36.140
Clothing companies do it all the time and they have the the legal guns to be able to defend themselves or even try to turn it around.

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:44.140
You know, say, oh, well, this is artwork of our property, of our intellectual property.

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:52.140
So. It's it's just disrespectful, but they do it for money.

01:21:52.140 --> 01:22:01.140
That's it. Money is is they don't they don't care what they have to do, if it's the least amount of work for the most amount of profit.

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:05.140
SSJ100 Matt reminding us of a classic story in the same vein here.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:12.140
Remember when they made Okami for Wii, they used an IGN screenshot from their site for the box art.

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:20.140
Granted, this isn't the same, but it's it's a funny case of big company being lazy and grabbing an image from somewhere because they're lazy.

01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.140
So too much right click, save power.

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:34.140
Yeah, I think it's person needed artwork in a hurry for ad, you know, and given deadline and no oversight.

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:48.140
This is why you have someone with your company who will check your art sources and make sure everything is cool before it goes out, just for purposes like that.

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:52.140
Mm hmm. You know. It's ridiculous.

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:58.140
All right. Well, this next story is firmly in the rumor department, but there's reasons for it.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:06.140
Usually we're talking about rumors, not because my uncle who works at such and such company said so, but because there are certain stars aligning in a certain way.

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:11.140
And this has to do with the potential new Contra game from way forward.

01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:20.140
And this is interesting because it's just I feel like there's been just a lot of buzz with Konami like these last few months just between their Silent Hill Direct.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:22.140
What we know is happening. We see CODEN.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:27.140
We had the story last week about they've reopened of sorts in office.

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:31.140
So they seem to be definitely planting a foot forward back into game development.

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:39.140
So couple that with LinkedIn, which is also always a very interesting source of these sorts of things.

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:51.140
A way forward employee on LinkedIn had a profile that said they developed gameplay, meta design, narrative and characters for a historic shooter property.

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:55.140
So that says that they're working on a game that belongs to it.

01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:57.140
I mean, that could still be a lot of things.

01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:10.140
But the description of the game says it's an unannounced triple A shooter of an existing franchise with four distinct gameplay styles, including run and gun, top down shooter, shmup and rail gun.

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:17.140
Which again, are all things that Konami and Contra have delved in at some point.

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:24.140
So this does seem to indicate, you know, and again, WayForward actually did Contra 4 back in 2007 for the Nintendo DS.

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:29.140
This wouldn't be the first time WayForward has worked with Konami if this is true.

01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:36.140
But the fact that here we are now, God, what 15 years later and potentially something new is coming out of it.

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:42.140
That's that's pretty interesting, but certainly probably going to be better received than Contra hardcore.

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:47.140
Sorry, Dark Tetsuya, I know you were a fan of that game, but most of the Internet was not on that one.

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.140
So we'll see.

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:54.140
But WayForward usually does some pretty solid stuff and Contra 4 was was good.

01:24:54.140 --> 01:25:00.140
So, yeah, I'd be I'd be very curious to see what they come up with if this is true.

01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.140
So. All right.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:09.140
Well, I know we've talked a little bit about Contra, one classic franchise.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:17.140
But here on the show every week, we like to celebrate all sorts of classic franchises or games in a segment we call Classic Game of the Week.

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:30.140
And so I should turn it over to the Segway.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:38.140
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:42.140
It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:46.140
All right, Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the game tonight?

01:25:46.140 --> 01:26:07.140
The game I chose is Galaxy Fraulein Yuna, or as it's known, Genga Ojosama Densetsu Yuna, which I've actually done a game in the series before, sort of in the series that had been included partly in the series anyway.

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:10.140
Because I did Sapphire before, remember?

01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:32.140
But Galaxy Fraulein Yuna originated in 1992 when Red Company, the creators, in association with Hudson Soft, reached out to Akitaka Mika to create a video game for the PC Engine Super CD.

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:52.140
As an established artist and a mechanical designer, also working on the Mobile Suit Gundam anime titles, including Zeta Gundam, War in the Pocket, and Stardust Memory, they were chosen to be a part of it.

01:26:52.140 --> 01:27:03.140
And so Hudson Soft released Galaxy Fraulein Yuna in Japan in 1992 with Akitaka Mika as the character designer and writer.

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:20.140
So the origins of Yuna are in Akitaka's MS Girls artwork, which features in many anime-related magazines during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with MS starting for Mobile Suit.

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:24.140
And it was pretty girls dressed in Gundam-style armor.

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:31.140
And Yuna was an evolution from that artwork.

01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:48.140
In fact, some of the characters in the worldwide merchandise division, 2001, of Le MS Girls, they bore huge resemblance to characters from the Yuna universe.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:55.140
And at Anime Expo 1998, I think I went to that one.

01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:10.140
Akitaka explained that Yuna began when the producer at the Red Company had him design a shoot-up game featuring a character based on his Gundam F91 girl, and it ended up becoming a visual novel instead.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:22.140
But that concept of the shooter is what became Gengafuke Densetsu Sapphire, which I've done before. I love Sapphire.

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:32.140
At any rate, the series became very popular very quickly and has led to so many different spin-offs.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:43.140
So we're going to go a little bit more into what the origin of the character in her universe is like.

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:58.140
So it stars a girl named Kagurazaka Yuna, who kind of has that whole Usagi trope about her, except she's a bit smarter and more coordinated.

01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:15.140
But she is the winner of an interstellar beauty contest, and she's a teen celebrity, an idol singer, even before she gets to be the savior of light, who is a magical girl that has to save the entire universe from the forces of darkness. No pressure.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:18.140
She's a model and an actress.

01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:38.140
Exactly. But there's a lot. There's a lot. And it was funny, I actually was getting some information off the TV Tropes website, and there's a lot of tropes that get touched.

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:53.140
Anywho, going back. So the games that existed, we start off with the original Galaxy Fraulein Yuna for PC Engine Super CD-ROM 2 in 1982.

01:29:53.140 --> 01:30:04.140
And it was the first Yuna work officially released to the public. And then there was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna 2 Eternal Princess for PC Engine Super CD-ROM in 1985.

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:18.140
There was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna FX for the PC-FX in 1996. There was Yuna Remix for Sega Saturn in 1996, which was an updated re-release of the original 1992 game.

01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:32.140
It had improved graphics and new animated cutscenes, and the game was released in both a normal and collector's edition that had many omake items.

01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:40.140
You know, omake is like bonus, like how my Cardcaptor Sakura set came with all that shit.

01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:41.140
Oh yes.

01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:49.140
There was also Galaxy Fraulein Yuna 3 Lightning Angel for Sega Saturn in 1997.

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:59.140
Galaxy Fraulein Yuna 3 Final Edition for PlayStation in 1998, which is a port of Lightning Angel with enhanced graphics and bonus content.

01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:05.140
There was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Collection for PSP, PlayStation Portable, in 2008.

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:11.140
It had an unenhanced port of the first two games, along with Sapphire on one disk.

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:17.140
And it had an image gallery, but there were no enhancements from the PC Engine versions.

01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:29.140
There were also two Sega Saturn disks called Mika Akitaka Illustrated Works Volumes 1 and 2, released in 1986 and 1997 respectively.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:38.140
And these were software that weren't true games, but collections of artwork, music, and digital omake.

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:56.140
Also in 1997, there were two computer software packages, the Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Hybrid Collection and the Visual Soundtrack, with the former being PC-related omake like desktop wallpaper, cursors, screensavers.

01:31:56.140 --> 01:32:00.140
I have a Street Fighter Alpha 2 one like that for the record.

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:05.140
And then the latter is music clips with like a slideshow video.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:18.140
And then while most of the games are of a visual novel, there are combat scenes that are sort of turn-based role-playing game style.

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:27.140
And Yuna 3 incorporates like a 3D isometric tactical view that puts the combat like a tactical RPG.

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:32.140
And also Yuna is a secret unlockable character in Saturn Bomberman.

01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:39.140
So, there's more!

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:45.140
Because remember, we had, was it Tetsuya that said this was a game?

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:47.140
Yes, this was a game.

01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:50.140
There were also two Yuna anime series.

01:32:50.140 --> 01:33:00.140
So the first was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Siren Sadness, which is a two-part OAV, translated and released in the West as Galaxy Fraulein Yuna.

01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:09.140
It follows the plot of the Yuna FX video game, and the opening sequence is identical except for the title card.

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:12.140
And it's portrayed as a comedy.

01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:19.140
The second was Galaxy Fraulein Yuna The Abyssal Fairy, which is a three-episode OAV.

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:25.140
And it was released as Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Returns or Dawn of Dark Sisters.

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:36.140
It doesn't duplicate any video game content, but chronologically it takes place before the first, after the first OAV, but before Yuna 3.

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:38.140
And it's a darker story.

01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:40.140
But it's mostly action drama.

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:42.140
And then there were the CD and music releases.

01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.140
So much music.

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:53.140
And there's even a radio show that ended up getting released as three separate CDs.

01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:55.140
Of course, drama CDs and everything.

01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:58.140
And a whole cast of characters.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:07.140
But it's that ultimate 90s style with the huge ass hair and the eyes the size of manhole covers.

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:10.140
So there you go.

01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:15.140
Rama in chat is mentioning that he bought that anime when he came out to visit.

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:18.140
I was there, I do believe.

01:34:18.140 --> 01:34:27.140
But I have like a couple of laser discs, I think, that I've acquired just from five dollar laser disc bins.

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:36.140
So, but I do have Sapphire, which, you know, was inspired by the original request for the game.

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:40.140
And I actually think I have the Galaxy Fraulein collection for PSP.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:47.140
Not that I've actually played the games, but I knew of the games before I knew of the anime.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.140
Funny how that works sometimes.

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:54.140
I've been into PC Engine games for a while.

01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:56.140
There it is, the classic game of the week.

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:59.140
Darsakha, you're going to have to read that name one more time because I will butcher it.

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:02.140
Galaxy Fraulein Yuna.

01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:04.140
It's German.

01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:08.140
Oh, I thought I had a whole subtitle to it as well, okay.

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:12.140
Well, I mean, there was the, hold on, I'll get to it.

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:16.140
It was, I just had it a second ago.

01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:25.140
Oh yeah, it was, it was like Genga Densetsu Fraulein Yuna, something like that.

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:32.140
I mean, it's like, what is it, Galaxy Legend Fraulein Yuna.

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:44.140
But yeah, anyway, but yeah, it's, it's definitely a big staple, I would say.

01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:47.140
All right, thanks for sharing it with us.

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:51.140
Because I have to admit, not one I'm super familiar with or know much about.

01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:54.140
But that's, I like to learn things here on OLR, don't we all?

01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:59.140
I haven't gone obscure in a while, so at least as far as obscure in North America.

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:01.140
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:05.140
All right, well, before we get into some rapid fire news, I just want to point out,

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:12.140
so earlier we were talking about like the Tron ride and all that stuff and the merchandising.

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:13.140
Merchandising.

01:36:13.140 --> 01:36:14.140
Yes, exactly.

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:18.140
So there was a link to Disney Food Blog, I guess.

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.140
I don't think this is official.

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.140
I think this is some fan thing.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.140
But SJ100Matt actually sent this to us.

01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:26.140
I'm actually looking at some of the merchandise that's available.

01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:31.140
And the very first thing I saw, the light up jacket with the shoulder cutouts, which

01:36:31.140 --> 01:36:34.140
is very interesting, kind of that style.

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:36.140
The Coro one.

01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:38.140
Yeah, 100 bucks for that, but it lights up.

01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:39.140
That's why.

01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:44.140
You can also get one that's all together like a normal type of hoodie for $100 as well,

01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:46.140
because the light up stuff is cool.

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:50.140
Now they sell these Tron identity discs with a Bluetooth speaker in them.

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:52.140
I remember the one I got in Electronica.

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:53.140
They had those at Disneyland.

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.140
They just made the-

01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.140
They're selling them.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.140
Oh, really?

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:57.140
Okay.

01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:58.140
Oh, that's good.

01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:00.140
Yeah, they're when you get off of...

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.140
Actually, they're at the Star Trader.

01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:08.140
I was going to say, I bet a lot of these do make their way over to Disneyland as well.

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:14.140
If nothing else, that gigantic World of Disney store usually almost has everything.

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.140
But yeah, they have some other various shirts, a little remote control light cycle, which

01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.140
I thought was funny.

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:21.140
Otherwise, some shirts and things.

01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.140
I like the water bottle.

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.140
I'll probably get the light up jacket.

01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:28.140
I mean, I did pay 75 bucks to get a Hawkeye jacket.

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:33.140
This also interacted with the ride somehow, I think.

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.140
Oh, probably.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:37.140
Yeah, because they just say they're Tron identity chips.

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:38.140
Yeah.

01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:40.140
But the water bottles light up too.

01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:44.140
That cracked me up.

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.140
And then you can even get little picture frames that say Tron.

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.140
All right.

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:51.140
Anyway, I'm going to stop giving Disney free advertising, but I'm sorry.

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:56.140
Tron just strikes a particular nerd nerve with me as I think that is true for all of

01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.140
us.

01:37:57.140 --> 01:38:00.140
You say Tron and we all go, huh?

01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:02.140
So it's just, here's what it is.

01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:06.140
You know what I found the other day organizing, Rob?

01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.140
My Kubrick Tron figures.

01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:09.140
Oh, cool.

01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:12.140
Yeah, the four pack.

01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:15.140
And then I got a shirt at...

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:17.140
Crap.

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:21.140
What was that store at downtown Disney called that had the expensive Disney shit?

01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:22.140
Oh God.

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:23.140
Yeah.

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:26.140
I can't remember, but I know what you're talking about.

01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:27.140
Yeah.

01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:31.140
But I have a Tron shirt from there with a yellow light cycle.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:34.140
And actually it was Chris that bought it for me.

01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:36.140
Oh, some comments in chat.

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:39.140
Bobby Blackwell is pointing out, we didn't talk about the action figure that you put

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.140
your face on.

01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:41.140
That came up in a previous episode.

01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:44.140
I know we talked about it already, but yes, that's another thing.

01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.140
I need this in my life.

01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:46.140
Yeah.

01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:47.140
Taking the lightsaber thing a step further.

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:49.140
You can actually build your own Tron action figure that's yourself.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:51.140
There you go, Dark Sakura.

01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.140
You can put yourself in Tron.

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:55.140
And it comes in an arcade cabinet.

01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.140
See, I cannot go to Disney World.

01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.140
I will be broke.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.140
It's a problem.

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.140
All right.

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:07.140
Let's travel around the industry real fast and check out some rapid fire news and some

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:11.140
other things that are going on that are worth our attention.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:13.140
Loki, we'll go to you.

01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:20.140
Yes, I'm always excited to talk about the power washing simulator universe.

01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:21.140
Hell yeah.

01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:28.140
And we got some roadmaps for 2023 coming to us from Future Lab, the developers of the

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:29.140
game.

01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:32.140
So, of course, they're talking about some of the things that are coming soon.

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:36.140
And then, of course, all throughout the end of the year, starting off, they're going to

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:42.140
be adding a brand new 1.2 patch, which adds additional jobs and updates some of the older

01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:43.140
ones.

01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:49.140
They're going to be doing some – and that's coming actually in two days, so April 18th.

01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:55.140
And then they're going to do a seasonal free content – they're going to have paid DLC

01:39:55.140 --> 01:40:00.140
and seasonal free content that's throughout the year, as well as exciting news in quarter

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.140
three as well.

01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:02.140
Sequel?

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:03.140
Sequel, maybe?

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:06.140
So, that'll be coming later on.

01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:10.140
But yeah, the free content is cool.

01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:17.140
I will definitely pick up the paid content, too, because I really like that game.

01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:22.460
Along with that, of course, there's going to be – Tekken 8 is expected to support

01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:29.640
cross-play for the first time, so you'll be able to mix PlayStation, PC, and Xbox all

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:30.640
together.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.640
That's pretty cool.

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.640
Pretty exciting.

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.640
Awesome.

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:36.640
DarkSaga?

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.640
So, surprising nobody.

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:47.640
The Mario movie has surpassed $500 million globally, and it is officially the biggest

01:40:47.640 --> 01:40:49.640
video game adaptation.

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.640
Well, mostly.

01:40:51.640 --> 01:41:00.640
It actually surpassed the other highest grossing film of 2023 so far, which was Ant-Man and

01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:03.140
the loss of Quantumania.

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:15.140
So, it is actually way ahead of other movies that were – well, first of all, I don't

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:28.140
know how Warcraft made what it did, but it exceeded Warcraft, which made $439,048,914,

01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:30.640
which actually made more than Detective Pikachu as well.

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:33.640
If these are global figures, Warcraft did very well in China.

01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:34.640
Gotcha.

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:38.640
But at any rate, yeah, it's the big one.

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.140
They've leveled up.

01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:41.640
New high score.

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:43.640
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:47.640
That sound was made at the box office this week, pretty much.

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:48.640
Yeah, basically.

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:49.640
I still need to see it.

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.640
At Nintendo, you got Ching.

01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:52.640
I still need to see it.

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.640
I'm hoping I'll get there this week.

01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:59.140
So, I didn't even talk – I got so sidetracked with the Creative Showcase, which I don't

01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:00.140
regret.

01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:01.140
It was a great time.

01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:03.140
I didn't even talk about other games I played this week.

01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:09.140
I've been playing Pokemon Legends on stream, and this is big for me, DarkSakura.

01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:12.140
I know you've done this with a few games.

01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:18.140
I'm about to beat Pokemon Legends on stream, and I would say most of my gameplay has been

01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.140
streamed.

01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:22.140
I've been side questing off stream, but my main questing I've been doing on stream.

01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:26.640
I believe – it's been a while, but I believe this is the first game I've played to completion

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.640
on stream, and I'm gonna roll credits on the game probably tomorrow after work, and

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:40.140
then maybe do some post-game stuff, because the thing with Pokemon is that you roll the

01:42:40.140 --> 01:42:42.140
credits, but have you really cleared the game?

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:45.640
There's still more to do, but I say if you get the credits, you beat the game.

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:48.140
That's kind of my criteria there.

01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:53.140
So I'm probably rolling credits on Monday's stream, and then we'll have a little time

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:57.140
to do some post-game stuff, and then the Final Fantasy Pixel remasters come out on PlayStation.

01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:01.640
That'll kind of be the next thing up in queue for me, but that's kind of a big deal

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.640
for me is actually getting to do that, so I just wanted to throw that out there.

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:15.640
The cool thing about RPGs is that you have the official – you have an actual end point

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.640
on it, you know?

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:17.640
Yeah.

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:25.640
And something – I mean, I love it when I get to the end of the RPGs that I do, and

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:29.140
it's a feeling of accomplishment, and then people get excited when they're there to

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.640
see it, so congratulations.

01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:32.140
Thank you.

01:43:32.140 --> 01:43:37.640
Well, and I realize Twitch has that memories feature that's really underused, but when

01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:41.640
I roll the credits, if you're there in chat, you will get the memories badge or whatever

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:46.140
it is, because I will hit the – I was too slow to do it when I got the shiny shanks,

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:50.140
because I realized it like two minutes after, but now I've got that locked and loaded

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:56.640
as a button for when I do those important things, so I'll remember that in the future.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.140
The reason why I brought that up, though, was that I've been so busy playing that

01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:03.640
game and doing that after work is that I haven't really had the time to go out to a movie,

01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.640
and I was pretty busy this weekend, so – but I'm going to try to get out during the

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.640
week at some point and see the Mario movie, because I do – you know, it's been out

01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.640
a couple weeks now.

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:12.640
I do want to see it, so.

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:13.640
Rob.

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:14.640
What?

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.140
Take me for my birthday.

01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.140
Uh, you're doing something on your birthday.

01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.140
What days are you free this week?

01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.140
My week is my birthday, duh.

01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:25.140
What days are you free?

01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:31.140
I will be free Thursday afternoon, because my subathon's gonna – if I make it the

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:33.640
full 24 hours, I end at 10 a.m.

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.140
Wait, I thought your subathon was on Thursday.

01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:40.140
No, it's on Wednesday, my birthday.

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:44.140
Oh my god, okay, my calendar – oh my god, it is.

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.640
I thought for some reason the 19th was Thursday.

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:49.640
No.

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.640
Ah, that's funny.

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.640
Okay, so maybe Thursday then.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:54.640
Alright.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:55.640
Yeah, let's do it.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:58.640
No, I'm not saying take me to see it.

01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.640
I would go see it.

01:44:59.640 --> 01:45:02.640
I mean, I can buy a movie ticket.

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:04.640
It's not a big deal, but yeah.

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.640
Oh, for me.

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.640
Oh, you shouldn't have.

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.640
Okay, on second thought, alright.

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:11.640
Hey!

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:13.640
No take back.

01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:15.140
Alright.

01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:23.140
Anyway, so now that we know what day 419 actually is, this begs the question, what are you doing

01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.140
on 420?

01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:30.140
It sounds like we might be going to see a movie, but something else you can do on 420

01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:33.140
is actually watch the Street Fighter VI showcase.

01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:37.140
That's right, just like we had the footage from Final Fantasy XVI this week, we get 30

01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:42.640
minutes of Street Fighter VI coming from Capcom on 420.

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.640
What a nice day to do that.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:49.140
So, you can watch that starting at 3 o'clock Pacific, 6 o'clock Eastern over at Capcom's

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:54.640
YouTube channel, and apparently Lil Wayne is going to be hosting the show, so that's

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.640
fun.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.640
So, yeah.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.640
But he's done stuff with Street Fighter before, so clearly he's a fan.

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:02.640
It was fun when I played it.

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.640
I had a really great time playing that game.

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:07.140
Yeah, we love even-numbered Street Fighter games.

01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:13.140
There will be details on the world tour, the battle hub, fighting ground, also some big

01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:15.140
news at the end of the show.

01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.140
Could Lil Wayne be joining the roster?

01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:18.140
Oh, boy.

01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:22.640
No, I don't think that'll be happening, but it'd be funny if it did, though.

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.140
Lil Jon will be joining the roster.

01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:26.140
Yeah!

01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:33.140
I can't do the impression like, what was her name on Snatch Game on Deja Sky did Lil Jon

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:35.640
and won with that whole thing.

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:41.640
But anyway, I'm sure they'll be announcing, yeah, now they're saying DLC in chat.

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:43.640
Mike Deff says Lil Wayne DLC.

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:44.640
We'll see.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.640
All right.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.640
Let's travel, oh, no, that was it.

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.640
So, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some things that

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:54.640
we could be playing this week on 4.20 or otherwise.

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:56.640
We'll start with you, Loki.

01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:58.640
What's coming out in the US?

01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:04.140
We have a game called God of Rock on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:06.140
One, and Xbox Series.

01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:12.140
We have The Mage Seeker, a League of Legends story on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation

01:47:12.140 --> 01:47:16.140
4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:19.140
Minecraft Legends comes out this week.

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:24.140
PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:28.140
I'll probably pick that up on Game Pass because I ain't buying that shit.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:32.640
Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:38.640
Akiba's Trip 2, Director's Cut on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4.

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:43.640
Arcana of Paradise, The Tower on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:49.640
DNF Duel for Nintendo Switch, unfortunately not a sequel to Duke Nukem Forever.

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:57.140
For Nintendo Switch, Stray Blade on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:00.140
Oh, we have this coming out this week.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:03.140
Wow, two surprises to me.

01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:09.140
Advance Wars 1 and 2 reboot camp for Nintendo Switch after its year delay.

01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:13.140
And it's finally happening.

01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:15.140
It's finally happening.

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:20.640
Island 2 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.640
That's it.

01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:22.640
Oh, heck.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:25.640
For as long as that game has kind of been in development, I'm kind of surprised.

01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.640
It seems to be just kind of like, and there it is this week.

01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.640
I hope they have some more marketing behind that to push that.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:35.640
So we'll see.

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:39.640
I feel like I've seen very little about that game, all things considered.

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:40.640
But we'll see.

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.640
No severed torso special edition this time, I guess.

01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:46.140
I guess not.

01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:49.140
There are no torsos.

01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:52.140
Going to Japan this week, check out some of the releases there.

01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:57.140
You have some overlap here in the US because Minecraft Legends also gets a Japanese release

01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:00.140
on the Nintendo Switch on April 19th.

01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:05.140
Also on the Switch this week, Coffee Talk Episode 2, Hibiscus and Butterfly.

01:49:05.140 --> 01:49:09.140
Not to be confused with the classic Saturday Night Live sketch.

01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.140
I'll give you a topic.

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.640
Coffee Talk is neither about coffee nor talk.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.640
Discuss.

01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:16.640
Welcome to Coffee Talk.

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.640
I'm Linda Richman.

01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:20.640
I love that.

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.640
That was the era of Saturday Night Live, but it has nothing to do with that.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:28.640
The game is like butter.

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.640
It's neither about hibiscus nor butterfly.

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:32.640
Discuss.

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.640
But that is the game that's coming out.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:40.640
It looks, honestly, I get big dating sim vibes from it, but they talk like you make your

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.140
own drinks using ginger, mint, and chocolate, and make secret recipes, and you draw latte

01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:50.640
art, because that is a fun, cute thing to do, I guess, and you relax in the coffee shop

01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:53.140
atmosphere.

01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:59.140
It is an urban fantasy game set in present-day Seattle where humans, orcs, elves, and other

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:03.140
races have been coexisting since the beginning of time.

01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:05.140
Okay.

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:09.140
This game kind of sounds off the rails a little bit, but I'm into it.

01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:11.640
So, that is out in Japan this week.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:12.640
Let's see.

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.640
Going back to the Switch and some other games coming out in Japan this week.

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:17.640
Buck and Yar is out this week.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:20.640
Akiba's Trip, Undead and Undressed Director's Cut.

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:25.640
That's a 10th anniversary edition that's coming out this week is also coming out.

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:29.640
Hatenna no Tu, the Tower of Children is out in Japan this week as well.

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:32.640
DNF Duel, also on the Switch this week.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.640
A game called Hyper High Speed Genius with arrows.

01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:41.140
It's a game about me.

01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:43.140
Jamie, you got your game.

01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:45.140
How about that?

01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:47.140
Well, let me actually, DarkSaga, let me show you.

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:52.140
If I actually showed you some screenshots from Hyper High Speed Genius, I think you'll

01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:56.140
be able to see exactly what kind of game this actually is.

01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:58.140
So, here's some screens.

01:50:58.140 --> 01:51:00.140
Yeah, I'm the one with the purple hair.

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:03.140
From Hyper High Speed Genius.

01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:05.140
I've had that haircut before, actually.

01:51:05.140 --> 01:51:08.640
It's got to be based on an anime or a visual novel or something, I don't know.

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.640
It looks like one of those.

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.640
It's one of those.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.640
I'm making a terrible joke.

01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:20.640
So, Hyper High Speed Genius, are they like internet people or something like that?

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:25.640
Is it like cheapified internet providers or something like that?

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:26.640
That'd be awful.

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:31.640
I would much rather play this game any day of the week than apparently what's coming

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.640
out on Xbox, which is very stable genius.

01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.140
I don't want to play that game.

01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:38.140
We're not going to play that game.

01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:40.140
All right.

01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:49.140
Here we have Xfinity Chan, who once every extra time you spend with her, she has to

01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:50.140
charge you.

01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:52.140
And then you have Spectrum Chan, who doesn't work half the time.

01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:54.140
She falls asleep.

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.140
All right, moving on.

01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:57.140
Can I finish?

01:51:57.140 --> 01:51:59.140
Can I finish?

01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:00.140
Canon.

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:04.140
I don't know if that's Kanan or Canon, but it's Canon with a K instead of a C. That is

01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:06.640
going to go out on the Switch in Japan this week.

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:08.640
That's Canon.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.640
Then I thought I would see the Advance Wars 1 and 2, but I don't actually see that for

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:13.640
Japan.

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:17.640
That is not actually being released there, or at least not this week.

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:22.640
Going to the PlayStation 5, however, Coffee Talk Episode 2 is also released there.

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:24.640
And that is really the big...

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.640
Oh, Minecraft Legends as well.

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:31.640
So not quite as much as you have on the Switch this week, but still a couple big titles there.

01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:32.640
That's Japan.

01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.140
How about the UK, Dr. Sakura?

01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:41.140
On the 18th, we have Minecraft Legends for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch.

01:52:41.140 --> 01:52:45.140
And also for those on the same day, God of Rock.

01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:48.140
Also on the 18th, The Pathless for Switch.

01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:52.140
On the 20th, Labyrinth of Zangetsu.

01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:55.140
That's for PlayStation and Switch.

01:52:55.140 --> 01:53:00.140
Also on that day, Front Mission First Limited Edition.

01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.140
That's for Switch.

01:53:02.140 --> 01:53:04.640
The rest are for the 21st.

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.640
We have Advance Wars 1 and 2 reboot camp for Switch.

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.640
We have Dead Island 2 for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:17.640
Prodeus with a D, like a delta in the center, for PlayStation and Switch.

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:21.640
And Turnip Boy commits tax evasion for PlayStation.

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:22.640
That game is weird.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:23.640
Nick's been playing that game.

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:25.640
Yeah, I was just going to say Nick was playing that the other day, yeah.

01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:27.640
I've got like two copies of it.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:29.640
The game's freaking weird.

01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.640
I love it.

01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:33.140
All right.

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:36.140
Before we get back into the news, I want to point this out.

01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:41.140
So Matt in chat, as showrunner Matt says, because we were talking about Coffee Talk,

01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:45.140
mentioning that Chapter 1 is actually on Xbox Game Pass.

01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:49.140
And sure enough, while you were going over the release dates, I brought up, because I'm

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:52.140
broadcasting from my PC, and I brought up the Xbox app.

01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:55.140
And sure enough, there's Coffee Talk available on Game Pass.

01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:59.140
So if you want to check this out, this isn't something that's unique to Japan.

01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:01.640
Now that I think about it, I think I have heard of this game before.

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.640
And it looks very interesting.

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:06.640
So that's interesting that they're getting like a sequel or something over there in Japan,

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:07.640
I guess.

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:10.140
Or maybe did they split it up or something over there?

01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:11.140
I don't know.

01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:14.640
But yeah, so if you want to check out Coffee Talk, it actually is on Xbox Game Pass.

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.140
And I'm sure that means on a variety of platforms here as well.

01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:22.640
So it just has been under my radar as sometimes games go, because there's just so many of

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.640
them.

01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.640
All right.

01:54:26.140 --> 01:54:29.640
Well, I can tell you one game I don't have to worry about going into my backlog because

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:30.640
I don't know if it's ever coming out.

01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.640
Loki.

01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.640
Yeah, well, we talked about it seems like it's just yesterday that we were talking about

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.140
delays of Suicide Squad.

01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:42.140
And here we are again talking about more delays of Suicide Squad.

01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:47.640
So Suicide Squad is now no longer coming out in May.

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:49.140
Originally, it was delayed.

01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:51.140
I don't remember what it was previously supposed to be coming out.

01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:54.140
I think February or something like that.

01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:57.140
And they were originally just going to do some polish on it.

01:54:57.140 --> 01:55:00.140
Well, apparently, they're going to need to do a lot more polish because now the game's

01:55:00.140 --> 01:55:02.140
coming out February 2024.

01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:08.640
Yeah, so they said we've made a tough but necessary decision to take the time needed

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:12.140
to work on getting the game to be the best quality experience for players.

01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:15.640
Thank you to our amazing community for the continued support, patience and understanding.

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:18.140
There's much more to share in the months ahead.

01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:20.640
We look forward to seeing you in Metropolis next year.

01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:23.640
Yeah, it's probably because the gameplay looked like garbage.

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:28.640
So, yeah, they probably need the overall a lot of stuff.

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.640
Can they do it in that amount of time, though?

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:33.140
I don't think you can do me.

01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:34.140
I don't know.

01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:36.140
No, we'll see.

01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:43.640
Well, a bad game is bad forever, but a good game people will forgive the delays that did

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:44.640
it.

01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.640
Okay.

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:46.640
Not always.

01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:48.640
I mean, like you got like, no, man.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:49.640
It's not bad.

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.640
It wasn't bad per se, but it was unfinished, I guess.

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:55.640
It wasn't what was promised for a lot of people that bought it.

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.640
It wasn't what was promised, but it eventually became a good game.

01:55:58.640 --> 01:55:59.640
No, that's true.

01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.640
That's true.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:01.640
That would be like one of the sole exceptions.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:03.640
Maybe Final Fantasy XIV as well.

01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:04.640
Diablo 3.

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:05.640
I like the Holy Trinity.

01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.640
Oh, and Destiny now is in that club, too.

01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.640
So those are like your core examples of games.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.640
That's right.

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:14.640
As it turns out, they were wrong.

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.640
Bad games don't have to be bad forever.

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.640
They could just be patched to hell.

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:23.640
Well, for the most part, unless, of course, the company gets sick and tired of patching

01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:29.640
their game, and then they just give up on it, like 90% of the time.

01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.640
Apex Legends.

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.640
It was not Apex Legends.

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:38.640
It was the one at the EA one.

01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:40.640
That was Apex Legends.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:41.640
Titanfall?

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:43.640
No, not Titanfall.

01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.640
No, not Apex Legends.

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.640
Apex Legends is good.

01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:48.640
Apex Legends has always been pretty well received.

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:49.640
No, no, no.

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:50.640
Not that one.

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:56.640
It's the EA one with the flying mech things, and it would look like it was going to be

01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:57.640
cool, but then it sucked.

01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:58.640
Oh, the BioWare one.

01:56:58.640 --> 01:56:59.640
Yeah.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:00.640
That never got better.

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:01.640
Anthem.

01:57:01.640 --> 01:57:02.640
Anthem.

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:03.640
That never got better.

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:07.640
I knew it began with an A. I was like, no, it's not Apex Legends, because that's good.

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.640
No.

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:09.640
Yeah.

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:10.640
Anthem.

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.640
Yeah.

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:15.640
Like Anthem, where they just put out a roadmap, and they're like, I don't want to do that.

01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:19.640
SHO 100 Matt in chat just points out, the core mechanics that people don't like, the

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:21.640
Ludo Schreuder live service stuff is going to stay.

01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:22.640
This is just polish.

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:23.640
Yeah.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:29.640
Pirate Pound Town in chat says, they had to delay because there wasn't a game to release.

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.640
There isn't even a crappy game to release at this point.

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.640
They've got nothing.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:37.640
So, I'm assuming that's a little bit of a read on the whole, like what that same like

01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:42.640
Games as a Service, you know, make the money, money, money.

01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:44.640
It's not merchandising, merchandising, merchandising.

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:52.640
It's mini transaction, micro transaction, DLC, game as a service, live charge every

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.640
month, monthly fee without calling it that.

01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.640
It's all those things they got to inject into the game.

01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:59.640
I don't even know like why these companies try to run out through the Games as a Service

01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.640
stuff, since most of them can't pull it off anyway, Square Enix.

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:06.640
So, I don't really know what the purpose, I guess, more money.

01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.640
They want more money.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:09.640
Got to have all the money.

01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:16.640
You say that, but do recall and I get the read on, you know, Avengers is completely

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.640
appropriate.

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:21.640
However, keep in mind their biggest cash cow right now is Final Fantasy 14.

01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:27.640
But that is still like an old school MMO model that only two other games that I can think

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:32.640
of in existence, at least in the US, can get away with and that's charging a monthly fee,

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.640
which will be World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 11.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:40.640
So, I don't know of any other games that charge a monthly fee.

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:41.640
Where's my 11 remake?

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:42.640
Where's my 11 remake?

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.640
It got canned a long time ago.

01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.640
I don't believe that.

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:47.640
You know what?

01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:49.640
No, tired Final Fantasy 11 remake.

01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.640
Wired?

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:54.640
Where the fuck is the Dragon Quest X offline game for the US?

01:58:54.640 --> 01:59:00.640
Like, I thought the whole reason they made Dragon Quest X offline was so that they could

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.640
finally fucking bring that game to the US and we still haven't seen it.

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:05.640
Hello?

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:08.640
That's that.

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:12.640
You want to go play Final Fantasy 11, there's plenty of private servers, happy to welcome

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.640
you, that have the trust disabled.

01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:17.640
And I don't think the book burning is even there too.

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:19.640
So, you can still go to the dunes like old times.

01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:21.640
That's the stuff you miss.

01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:25.640
Yeah, with the XP modifiers, it's like 10 times the XP where you can just solo your

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.640
way through the entire game.

01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.640
It's actually a lot of fun.

01:59:29.640 --> 01:59:34.640
It's more fun with people, obviously, but you know, I had a good time.

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:35.640
I would totally play that some more.

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:39.640
Several people in chat noting Final Fantasy 14, another example of bad games eventually

01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:40.640
getting fixed.

01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.640
I thought that was the first one you said, Loki.

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:42.640
Maybe I missed it.

01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:43.640
It was like the second one I said.

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.640
Okay.

01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:47.640
I knew it was the first one, then Final Fantasy 14 was the second one, but yeah.

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:48.640
All right.

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:54.640
Well, moving on, on the same note of patches and things like that, Dark Sakura.

01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:56.640
Oh, yes.

01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:00.640
Well, Capcom's in it again.

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:09.640
Apparently, there's a big Reddit discussion where it was discovered that the ray tracing

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:15.640
options have been disabled for Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes on Steam, as well as some

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:22.640
of the HDR not working the way it was intended to, and there's been no way to roll it back

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:33.640
or anything yet, but there is kind of a positive, is that the Danuvo was removed from the Steam

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.640
version of Resident Evil Village.

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.640
Oh.

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:41.640
So, because they showed how much better the game played without it, so it's gone.

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:46.640
Interesting, because that never was making the fans happy, so that's, oh, interesting

02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:48.640
they actually removed it, huh?

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:50.640
Yep, it gone.

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:51.640
Interesting.

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:54.640
All right, well, something that's been added, and this is pretty historic.

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.640
Like, look, I know, what year was it that was the year of Luigi?

02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:01.640
Was that 2017 or 2018 that we had the year of Luigi?

02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:07.640
I gotta say, this just feels like the year of Mario, I mean, because of the movie, and

02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:11.640
obviously doing very well, and you would think a game would come at some point this year,

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.640
but what do I know?

02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:15.640
But, this is very big news as well.

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:19.640
It's just what a cultural phenomenon Super Mario Brothers has really cemented itself

02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:23.640
as, you know, and if you're a gamer, you always knew this, but it seems like the rest

02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:25.640
of pop culture is catching up.

02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:31.640
Super Mario Brothers, the actual theme, is now going to be the first video game music

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:35.640
that is actually inducted into the Library of Congress.

02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:40.640
The NRPB, which is the National Recording Preservation Board, has announced that Koji

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:45.640
Kondo's Super Mario Brothers theme will be preserved in the U.S. Library of Congress.

02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:49.640
And, of course, that's a doo doo doo doo doo doo.

02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.640
That is the first piece of video game music ever to join the NRPB's catalog of what they

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.640
call significant compositions.

02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:03.640
Every year, 25 pieces of music are selected that are deemed culturally, historically,

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:10.640
or aesthetically significant, and or informs or reflects life in the United States.

02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:17.640
To give you a perspective of what else is being inducted, Stairway to Heaven by Led

02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:23.640
Zeppelin is being inducted this year, Like a Virgin by Madonna, Sweet Dreams Are Made

02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.640
of This by Eurythmics, Imagine by John Lennon.

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:28.640
Is this the first year?

02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:30.640
How have some of these songs not been in?

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:32.640
My goodness.

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.640
Wow.

02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:35.640
Mike Deff says the year of Luigi was 2013.

02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:36.640
It was that long ago?

02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:38.640
Holy smokes.

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:40.640
And then this one actually made me laugh.

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.640
Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas is You is also...

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:56.640
And I'm not saying anything, but I'm just saying it has been noted that Take On Me by

02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.640
A-ha was not actually inducted into the Hall of Fame.

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.640
I'm not saying, but I'm just saying.

02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:05.640
So anyway, but I do love that song.

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.640
All right.

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:10.640
Anyhow, I totally just stole your story, didn't I, Loki?

02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:11.640
It's all good.

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.640
Why don't you steal mine?

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:13.640
What do we got left?

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:14.640
Sounds good.

02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:20.640
Yeah, we'll talk about the brand new game from the creators of Wordle is now debuting,

02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:24.640
I guess, on The New York Times, because remember, hey, they have games now.

02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.640
So it's called Digits.

02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:31.640
It's a daily math puzzle game that originally when I first heard this, I thought it was

02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:34.640
those stupid memes that they have on like Facebook.

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.640
I was like, you'll never guess this.

02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:37.640
It's always order of operation questions.

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:41.640
But no, it's actually they give you a number and then a bunch of numbers below that.

02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:48.640
You have to use basically the different, you know, arithmetic stuff to try to come up with

02:03:48.640 --> 02:03:49.640
the final number.

02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:55.640
So you can add your addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and you have to

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:59.640
use the numbers that are given to you to get to that number.

02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:02.640
I swear I played something like this before.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:03.640
I swear I did.

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:04.640
Okay.

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.640
Oh, 69.

02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:06.640
Nice.

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:07.640
Okay.

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:08.640
Oh, is that today's number?

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:09.640
Today's number is 69.

02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:10.640
Hold up.

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:11.640
Hold up.

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:16.640
Do these folks know how to get people on board to play or what?

02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:23.640
I'm surprised it's not 69 for 20.

02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.640
So you have to figure out how to use these numbers to make 69.

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:29.640
Yes.

02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.640
Okay.

02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.640
That might be difficult.

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:33.640
That might be difficult.

02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.640
My goodness.

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.640
Okay.

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.640
Well, if you took, Oh, I don't know.

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:40.640
This would be incredibly boring radio.

02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:41.640
I'm sorry.

02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.640
I thought maybe I could try to show you like how to play digits thing.

02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:45.640
It like gives you the answer.

02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.640
Oh, I closed it.

02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.640
I didn't watch it enough.

02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:49.640
Yeah.

02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:50.640
Interesting.

02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:52.640
So you like you would add these.

02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:54.640
So you do like three plus five.

02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.640
Okay.

02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:57.640
Is eight times seven.

02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:59.640
Oh, eight.

02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:00.640
Oh, eight.

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.640
Oh, they, they merge and become a new card after that.

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:06.640
Oh, okay.

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:07.640
Interesting.

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:11.640
I have to screw around with that at some point.

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:13.640
See if I can figure it out.

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:14.640
So cool.

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:18.640
Dejara mess and chat says arithmetic lounge radio.

02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:19.640
Yes.

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:20.640
Yes.

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:21.640
Here we are.

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:22.640
Math.

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:23.640
It's fun.

02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:24.640
Anyway, you know what else is fun is hearing from you all.

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:29.640
If you want to give us a call, you can over at our, I almost gave the, my brain went to

02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:34.640
the old 800 number, which has been shut off for like 10 years.

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:36.640
My brain started to go eight, seven, seven game.

02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:37.640
Woo.

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:38.640
Okay.

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:39.640
No, don't, don't use that.

02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:44.640
But you can go to our discord over at vog network.com slash discord, and you can join the green

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:47.640
room and we'll hear from some of you that want to call in here.

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.640
We'll talk to you all here, live on air.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:55.640
Or of course you can always just ask the question, our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog

02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:57.640
network, VOG network.

02:05:57.640 --> 02:06:01.640
And of course you can always email us, participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:04.640
But sadly I think we have another week of a dry mailbag.

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.640
I don't think I saw anything come in there this week.

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:07.640
Are correct, sir.

02:06:07.640 --> 02:06:08.640
Aha.

02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:09.640
Yeah.

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.640
Defton chat says, can you even call that number anymore?

02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.640
I'm sure you can, but you're not going to get us.

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:19.640
I'm sure it probably leads to a porn line or a, uh, something you don't want to hear

02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:20.640
from.

02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.640
I wouldn't, I would not advise it.

02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:22.640
That's why I didn't finish saying the old number.

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:25.640
I would advise calling it cause I have no idea what it is.

02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:28.640
So, Oh, one 800 porn.

02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:35.640
Oh, well look, if we could have gotten that number back in the day, happily.

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:43.640
So for the record, I added, I added the suggested alert, Rob, a suggested alert.

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:44.640
Yeah.

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:46.640
I will tell you later.

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:47.640
Oh, okay.

02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:48.640
All right.

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:49.640
Yeah.

02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:55.640
But I'm testing things for us because I have an announcement to make.

02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:56.640
Okay.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:04.640
This week when I am not playing games, I am going to be working on new VOG merch.

02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:05.640
Oh yay.

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:06.640
We've been missing that.

02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:11.640
And I'll have to talk to you about setting up our fourth wall.

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:12.640
Cool.

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:13.640
Yeah.

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:14.640
We can do that.

02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:15.640
Although that's probably a discussion Bobby needs to be into.

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:18.640
Cause he knows all the business stuff better than me, but yeah.

02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:20.640
Um, but yeah, that'd be great.

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:23.640
Cause actually if we get that going, then I can get some merch just in time for dragon

02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:25.640
con and wear some of that stuff there.

02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:26.640
So that'd be good.

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:28.640
Cause yeah, if you haven't heard, I will be a dragon con that's all the way labor day

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:29.640
weekend though.

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:32.640
So I know not everybody's planning for that yet, but then again, dragon con, some people

02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:36.640
wait all year for, so, you know, you might be thinking about it, but that will be Atlanta

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.640
over labor day weekend.

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:39.640
So there you go.

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:44.640
Um, I, um, yeah, I'm hoping there'll be some other stuff I can talk about real soon too,

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:48.640
as far as the convention stuff goes, but we'll, uh, we'll cross that bridge when we get to

02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:49.640
it.

02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:57.640
So, um, also I did mention earlier, but we're going to be, uh, not here on may 21st, which

02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:59.640
is a very random day to not be here.

02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:00.640
And it's completely my fault.

02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:01.640
It's actually work's fault.

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:04.640
I'm going to a work conference and here's the weird thing.

02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:05.640
I've never heard of this.

02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:10.640
The work conference starts on a Sunday, which I've never like, what?

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:13.640
But yeah, like they have programming and everything on Sunday.

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:16.640
So I get to go listen to talks about my industry for my day job.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.640
So I won't be here.

02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:18.640
Sadly.

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:19.640
Yeah, I know.

02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:20.640
Right.

02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:24.640
Uh, I, and that's, I had to, I was supposed to host a show that Saturday night and now

02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:28.640
I have to fly to where I'm going that Saturday night instead of, uh, doing that show.

02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:30.640
I hate canceling that stuff.

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:34.640
Cause it's like when you, when you look unreliable, that's when they stop asking you to do it.

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:39.640
But you know, obviously he knows, I know he knows this out of my control and it gave

02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:43.640
him absolutely as much notice as possible, but it's still, you know, it's, it's the inner

02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:44.640
demons.

02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:45.640
Yeah.

02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:48.640
Uh, Dr. Sia says, let me know if the shirts come back.

02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:49.640
We'll definitely be interested.

02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:50.640
Awesome.

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:51.640
Awesome.

02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:52.640
Pod culture's going back to dragon con this year.

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:53.640
Awesome.

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:54.640
I'm really happy to hear that.

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.640
Can't wait to see you.

02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:56.640
It's been a long time.

02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:01.640
So, um, I, as far as I know, we're supposed to still be involved with the same tracks

02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:02.640
that I was last year.

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:05.640
I, I think I'll be on horror again this year.

02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:08.640
I don't know for sure yet, but the other two look very favorable.

02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:13.640
So, um, I haven't talked to the horror track, uh, individual, but I had a lot of fun doing

02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:14.640
the panel I did there last year.

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:15.640
I'd love to do it again.

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:17.640
So we'll see.

02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:18.640
All right.

02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:23.640
Well, unfortunately we have a lack of calls, uh, waiting so that that's it.

02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:25.640
We're going to go ahead and wrap up the show.

02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:27.640
Um, but thank you of course, for being here tonight.

02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:31.640
We appreciate all of the faces here live and we appreciate the faces on the podcast feed

02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:32.640
as well.

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:36.640
If you enjoyed what you heard here on Orange Loon, Orange Loon's radio, if you enjoyed

02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:40.640
what you heard here on Orange Lounge radio, my brain is malfunctioning.

02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:41.640
Okay.

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:44.640
Since we're ending early tonight, I went out last night.

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:46.640
I'm in my forties now.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:47.640
Okay.

02:09:47.640 --> 02:09:48.640
No secret.

02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:49.640
I, you know, and I, I love my forties.

02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:53.640
I had a good time, but I don't go out and party or whatever you want to call it.

02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:58.640
I got to bars and drink excessively the way I used to maybe 15, 20 years ago.

02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:03.640
Last night I went out to a bar and drank excessively.

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:09.640
So today, if my brain seems like, wow, your wires are like not fully connected in your

02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:13.640
brain today, you would be right.

02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:15.640
See, I, I nailed it.

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:16.640
I nailed it.

02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:17.640
I knew something was up.

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:18.640
Yeah.

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.640
And please, and I thought it was allergies.

02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:21.640
Always do that stuff responsibly.

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:23.640
I had a ride there and a ride back.

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:25.640
I never operated the vehicle.

02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:27.640
So just making that clear.

02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:29.640
I never do that stuff unless I have a plan.

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:34.640
That's why usually that type of stuff and me drinking excessively is limited to two

02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.640
times a year.

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:38.640
Number one, the star Trek cruise, cause I'm on a boat.

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:39.640
There's nowhere for me to drive to.

02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:45.640
Number two, dragon con because, well, I'm not on a boat, but I'm a dragon con because

02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:51.640
con period, any, anybody like drinking excessively is like one of the tent poles of a con.

02:10:51.640 --> 02:10:54.640
There's, um, uh, panels.

02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:56.640
There's the expo hall.

02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.640
There's the dealer's room and there's drinking excessively.

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:01.640
Yeah.

02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:08.640
But, but if that's funny though, I, I, I cannot say anything bad about that because the place

02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:14.640
that you went to does, there's, there's, if it's the same person I'm thinking of makes

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:16.640
excellent drinks and a little strong.

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:17.640
Yeah.

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:22.640
But, and I'm just, and just to be full, if you are not a drinker, I just want to make

02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:24.640
sure everybody knows we love our sober friends.

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:25.640
They help to give us rides.

02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:28.640
Nobody should ever feel pressure to do that type of thing.

02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:32.640
If drinking is not your thing, cause I don't want to just be out here glamorizing it.

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:35.640
It's just a silly thing that happens once in a great while.

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:37.640
So that's all.

02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:38.640
Um, let's see.

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:39.640
Yeah.

02:11:39.640 --> 02:11:42.640
S200 Matt says Rob is not Sally O'Malley.

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:47.640
No, but I did see Molly Shannon on Saturday Night Live recently bringing back that character

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:48.640
and it was everything.

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.640
Cause I'm 50, 50 years old.

02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:56.640
That's, that's, that's going to be Travis Donovan pretty soon.

02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:01.640
I hope, I hope to God Travis Donovan comes back to the internet just to say that, just

02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:04.640
to say that when he turns 50.

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:11.640
And of course I'm getting advice from DJ Rama S saying drink Gatorade and Pedialyte.

02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:12.640
You can thank me later.

02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:16.640
I definitely had vitamin water, which is basically a very similar sort of thing.

02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:20.640
Uh, today you want to, you also want to have a vitamin B12.

02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:21.640
Yes.

02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:24.640
I have this, um, like Mio stuff that's infused with B12.

02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:28.640
And if you've seen an orange drink in here earlier, that was exactly what that was, was

02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:29.640
B12 infused.

02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:34.640
Although I will tell you the cocktail that I would make for everybody, it would be a

02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:42.640
very nasty, potent tea that works wonders with, uh, made of ginger.

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:45.640
And I think sometimes I would do peppermint.

02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:47.640
Peppermint and ginger are weird together.

02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:55.640
And willow bark, the stuff that the origin of salicylic acid, which is salicin, what

02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:00.640
they make aspirin from, which is acetylsalicylic acid.

02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:06.640
All right, well, we're very clearly off topic enough where it's time to wrap it up for tonight,

02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:08.640
but I want to thank you all for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.

02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:12.640
If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show tonight, or if you didn't, you know,

02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:15.640
try again next week, maybe it'll be more on topic, but I hope you did enjoy tonight's

02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:16.640
show.

02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.640
We had a lot of awesome, great stuff.

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:19.640
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:22.640
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we

02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:24.640
need more voices to put out here on air.

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:26.640
So, you know, spread the word.

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:27.640
Social media posts are awesome.

02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:29.640
I can't tell you how much those help.

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:33.640
A five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, wherever it is you found this podcast,

02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:36.640
those go an awful long way as well.

02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:41.640
We will be back in seven days to do this all again next week.

02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:44.640
Dark Soccer, I know you have a big personal stream coming up on your birthday, and now

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.640
I know this entire time I thought the 19th was Thursday.

02:13:48.640 --> 02:13:49.640
I knew your birthday was 19th.

02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:51.640
I just thought the 19th was Thursday.

02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:52.640
So it's actually Wednesday.

02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:55.640
So you're having an all day stream on Wednesday.

02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:57.640
Starting at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

02:13:57.640 --> 02:13:58.640
Alright, sounds good.

02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:00.640
DarkSakura underscore O-L-R.

02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:01.640
Sounds good.

02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:03.640
Good luck and happy early birthday.

02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:05.640
Thank you.

02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:06.640
Oh, you signed off.

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:08.640
I was going to give you a final thought, but if that was it, so be it.

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:09.640
Oh, yeah, I thought that.

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:11.640
Okay, well, I'll say something else.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:12.640
Please.

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:20.640
If I hit 250 subs, I'll bleach my hair during the stream.

02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:22.640
Alright, good times.

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.640
I have Olaplex.

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:24.640
I'm serious about this.

02:14:24.640 --> 02:14:25.640
This is a beauty stream.

02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:29.640
And then I'll promptly dye it red again.

02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:32.640
Alright, have a good one, DarkSakura.

02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:33.640
Bye.

02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:34.640
Alright, Loki, we'll go to you.

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:36.640
What's your final thought tonight?

02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:38.640
It's jury duty week.

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:40.640
Oh, that's right.

02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.640
Oh, may you be blessed with the blessings I had earlier this month.

02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:52.640
Well, now the update is I have to stand by to check again on Tuesday.

02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:54.640
Like, I have to check Tuesday evening.

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:56.640
So, it's the latter half of this week or not.

02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:59.640
Oh, okay, I was going to say I went in on Tuesday and you saw how that went for me.

02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:03.640
So, okay, but you checked Tuesday to maybe go in on Wednesday.

02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:06.640
Yeah, I still don't want to do that.

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:09.640
Work wants me to come into the office too.

02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:11.640
I won't do that either.

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:14.640
So, it's a week if I don't want to do things.

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:16.640
I don't want to.

02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:22.640
And my final thought tonight is I'm more than likely, unless I'm seriously missing something with the story,

02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:25.640
I'm more than likely beating Pokemon Legends Arceus on my stream tomorrow.

02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:28.640
So, I hope to see you over at Rob Roberts on Twitch.

02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:31.640
And yeah, excited for what the coming months have to bring.

02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:34.640
I've got a lot going on at work, but it's good stuff.

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:37.640
I really like my job, but very busy for me this month.

02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:40.640
So, yeah, sadly it's kind of cutting into the games a little bit,

02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:44.640
but the live streaming has been a good way to stay on top of at least one game.

02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:46.640
So, all right, that's it.

02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.640
That's going to do it for our episode tonight here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:51.640
I hope you all have a wonderful week.

02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:53.640
We will see you in seven days to do it all again.

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:54.640
Good night.
