Since the loss of ThinkGeek, there's been a void of great geek April Fools, especially for anything that could be feasibly tangible. Hats off to the Sonic social team for having a dream as completely off the beaten and expected paths as it was, and congratulations on making it happen. The reaction to the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has been wonderful to see, the commentary has been amazing, and it's always a treat to start April in smiles and fascination rather than not.

00:30.000 --> 00:58.480
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again, with episode number 955 of our show for tonight, April the 9th of 2023.

00:58.640 --> 01:06.560
My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined, as always, by my co host. Say hello first and foremost to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:07.280 --> 01:07.600
Jamie Summers Hey.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.800
Hi, how are you doing?

01:09.680 --> 01:10.440
Jamie Summers I'm okay.

01:10.480 --> 01:10.920
Rob Roberts Yeah?

01:10.960 --> 01:15.280
Jamie Summers My- I've been doing new things with my body.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.360
Rob Roberts Now, now this is a family show.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.440
Jamie Summers It's clean.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.480
Rob Roberts Okay, what kinds of things?

01:22.480 --> 01:36.320
Jamie Summers Well, I've gotten back, I can now lift some weights again. I do yoga practically every day now. And I'm starting basic ballet.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.480
Rob Roberts Oh, wow. Okay. It's very artistic. I love that.

01:41.240 --> 02:04.960
Jamie Summers Well, I have to have a bar and I found some courses that teach online. And now I have mad respect for, for dancers. Just just try to go from a first position demi plié into elevé and do that 20 times.

02:05.960 --> 02:09.280
Rob Roberts Will I be seeing you in next year's production of The Nutcracker?

02:10.200 --> 02:15.720
Jamie Summers No. But apparently, Queer Jesus just followed me. So I'm following them back.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.720
Rob Roberts Well, it's a good day for that.

02:18.680 --> 02:38.360
Jamie Summers But at any rate, it's, it's all this attempt I'm doing to try to get the range of motion back in my in my hips since I have arthritis. And I'm doing so much stuff now that now my back actually starts hurting if I don't maintain good posture.

02:38.360 --> 02:50.560
Jamie Summers So, um, but I'm, I'm, I'm trying to get myself stronger, get myself geared up. And of course, there's all the prep work for the event on my birthday.

02:50.560 --> 02:54.120
Rob Roberts Getting old is fun. Is the lesson learned there?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.920
Jamie Summers No, it's not old. Older.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.680
Rob Roberts Old. Okay, yes. Older.

02:59.680 --> 03:06.720
Jamie Summers We're older every day. Old is not. It doesn't mean anything.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.520
Rob Roberts I'm older now than I was when the show started.

03:08.520 --> 03:20.360
Jamie Summers Everyone is. But old doesn't mean anything anymore. It's, it's a state of being and not a number on the calendar.

03:21.200 --> 03:28.800
Rob Roberts All right. Well, also say hello to somebody. I don't know if he's going to be signing up for ballerina classes anytime soon. But you never know. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.880
No, I will not be doing that.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.800
Jamie Summers You know what, you don't need to improve your posture. Like I, I think I do.

03:34.880 --> 03:41.720
Rob Roberts No, I absolutely do. But that will be not that that's not the method I'll be using to improve my posture.

03:41.720 --> 03:46.320
Jamie Summers You could start by actually playing that Dance Dance Revolution machine in your garage.

03:46.680 --> 03:59.320
Rob Roberts You know, actually, funny. Yeah. Funny you mentioned that. Yeah, I should do that. I earlier this week, I was like, man, I need to go out there and like, just hook everything back up again, because it's broken PC.

03:59.320 --> 04:10.640
Jamie Summers I don't know if you went outside today, but it's like, oh, shit. Summer just showed up all of a sudden. It's not that bad. But I was like, I did. Yeah, we had our week long transition. Spring happened and now it's summer. So yeah.

04:11.840 --> 04:27.720
Jamie Summers sj100matt in our chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show. sj100matt in chat says I mean, DDR does have a bar. So

04:28.720 --> 04:33.720
Jamie Summers it's a difference between a bar and a bar. There is B a r r e.

04:35.440 --> 04:52.200
Jamie Summers And for the record, I'm not planning on going out and actually being a dancer. I just want to learn the techniques and, and have the benefit of it. I'm not an in person performer performer unless it's like musical instruments or whatever.

04:52.200 --> 05:01.320
Jamie Summers And it's not for everybody. It just happened to be the thing that has really done wonders for my mobility.

05:01.320 --> 05:21.840
Jamie Tworkowski There's, there's, you're not going to appreciate this comparison. I'm sorry, but it's the first thing that comes to mind. But I'm very familiar with a lot of ladies and guys too and theys that have done pole dancing classes for very similar reasons. It's not that they ever really intend to use it. But it's that same type of, you know, yeah.

05:21.840 --> 05:47.160
Jamie Tworkowski In comparison, I actually found video of ballerina pole dancers. By training usually a ballerina is going to have stronger legs than upper body. And a pole dancer is going to have a stronger upper body. So put the two together and you're seeing musculature that belongs on She-Hulk doing things on a pole I never thought were possible.

05:47.160 --> 06:04.080
Jamie Tworkowski For my birthday once, a friend, well, sadly, a former friend, but still at the time, it was very nice gesture, did a free like comp pole dancing class for me and a few friends. And I remember Extafur was there as well.

06:04.920 --> 06:15.040
Jamie Tworkowski Yeah, it was, you know, like I said, it was a different time. But at the time, we had a great time and Extafur was very good at pole dancing as it turns out.

06:16.040 --> 06:22.280
Brandon Zemp You answered your question, Darksack, right? Yes, there was a pole dance hero. It was an adult swimming web game.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.520
Jamie Tworkowski Oh shit. Why have I not played this?

06:27.120 --> 06:38.520
And DJ Rama S in our chat says there is a pole dancing anime coming out later this year called Pole Princess. Well, I guess the name Pole Position was taken.

06:39.200 --> 06:45.200
Brandon Zemp Yeah, I was gonna say I want to see the anime with pole dancing, you know, race cars, pole position. Hell yes.

06:45.200 --> 07:10.160
All right, sorry to take your joke. All right, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about something admittedly I have yet to see. But the reality is a lot of you have seen it. And I mean, a lot of you have seen it. And it is the Super Mario Brothers movie, which, of course, was released into theaters this weekend. I did not get around to seeing it this weekend. I don't think, Darksack, I don't think you did. I remember

07:10.240 --> 07:13.920
I have not. Yeah, I'm actually considering going to see on like a Tuesday mat.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.960
That's where I'm at. I kind of like I'll find a weeknight I can go.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.120
Yeah, but I still have other stuff I'd rather see.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.680
Loki, you did see it.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.760
I mean, honestly, like if you're gonna go to the movie. Yeah, it was it was good.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.320
You want to see it again? You want to see it again? That's what you're gonna say, huh?

07:29.680 --> 07:30.320
No, no, no, no.

07:30.320 --> 07:34.440
So so I was actually I was talking about this earlier to my sister, so

07:35.360 --> 07:38.760
they were talking about like the Dungeons and Dragons movie and Mario.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.920
And I was like, if someone asked me, hey.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.400
Let's go see one of those two movies again this week or something like that.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.440
I picked the Dungeons and Dragons movie.

07:47.440 --> 07:52.440
OK, that's not to say that the the Super Mario movie wasn't good.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.640
It was good. I liked it.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.040
I think it's kind of just your run of the mill, like.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.240
Illumination movie, I guess it's not bad.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.920
It's just not like it wasn't hilarious.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.520
It wasn't like super funny or anything.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.240
It was just it was satisfying.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.200
It was satisfying to watch.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.080
Is it something I need to see like right away again?

08:12.760 --> 08:15.320
I mean, maybe if I want to pick up like on some of the background

08:15.320 --> 08:18.200
like Easter eggs and stuff like that a little bit more than what I did.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.680
But Dungeons and Dragons was funny,

08:21.680 --> 08:24.400
like I actually laughed out loud at a bunch of stuff in that.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.760
That's a great movie.

08:26.520 --> 08:27.800
Like that, I would see again,

08:27.800 --> 08:29.760
and I'm very excited to see what they do with that humor.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.680
But like, honestly, both are good.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.840
I'm sure a lot of your gaming podcasts that you all listen to out there

08:34.840 --> 08:37.840
are going to be talking a little bit in depth about their impressions

08:37.840 --> 08:40.120
or reviews of the movie, and that's great.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.160
So I suppose I should allow Loki a little bit of space

08:43.160 --> 08:45.680
without spoiling anything, obviously, because not only have you

08:45.680 --> 08:49.040
and Dark Soccer and I not seen it, but I'm sure there's people listening in chat.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.880
So obviously gags, specifics in the gags aside,

08:53.080 --> 08:55.680
what were kind of just, I guess, your general thoughts on the movie?

08:55.680 --> 08:56.960
I mean, you kind of started to go there.

08:56.960 --> 09:00.520
You talk about that it was satisfying, but like, you know,

09:01.440 --> 09:03.720
were you kind of did you see like opportunities

09:03.720 --> 09:06.000
they needed to take advantage of that weren't there? Was it?

09:06.600 --> 09:09.160
Yeah, the opportunity they should have taken advantage of.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.320
Don't show the whole movie in your trailers.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.360
That's number one, because there's a lot of stuff that would have been

09:15.360 --> 09:18.120
more impactful had they not shown it in their trailers.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.680
And yeah, I was excited about the movie.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.400
So I watched the trailers and the TV spots and all that stuff.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.160
But they showed a lot of the movie,

09:25.160 --> 09:27.920
like a lot of the big stuff that was in there. Yeah.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.760
So there wasn't like any surprises, kind of.

09:30.760 --> 09:35.120
And I think that's what kind of made it not as good as it could have been,

09:35.120 --> 09:39.920
is because, you know, all of that surprise was kind of thrown out the window.

09:41.160 --> 09:45.280
You know, generally, I mean, plot wise, funny,

09:45.280 --> 09:48.640
you know, it sort of kind of reminds me a little bit of the the 90s

09:48.640 --> 09:52.120
Mario movie in a sense, like there's a part at the end

09:52.120 --> 09:56.600
that is like what what they were trying to do in the 90s movie.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.720
But then they actually did it in this one. But then

10:00.800 --> 10:03.400
I don't know, like there's a lot of like

10:03.400 --> 10:07.520
Easter egg stuff in there, like obviously, you know, the DK rap,

10:07.520 --> 10:09.840
like the Mario Brothers,

10:11.320 --> 10:15.120
you know, TV show theme, which you saw in the commercial again.

10:15.120 --> 10:19.920
Once again, there's all that stuff and there are lots of music things.

10:20.920 --> 10:25.920
Rob was right again about, you know, who Charles Martinet played, obviously.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.960
I won't remind you, but go check the tapes on that episode.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.760
I told you exactly what his role would be.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.320
And it turns out, just add that to the scoreboard.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.360
Yeah, I heard he actually has two characters, but.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.720
But yeah, it still was.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.680
Yeah, I mean, so it made sense.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.040
I mean, I don't know, I think it was pretty good.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.680
It's just it's one of the things, though, it's like, I'm

10:49.640 --> 10:52.640
am I like super pumped for like when the next movie comes out?

10:52.880 --> 10:53.920
Yeah, I'll see it.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.480
I'm not like, you know, really, really excited.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.240
Probably this time would be I would try to avoid the trailers

11:00.240 --> 11:03.560
because apparently illumination, the folks behind that,

11:03.920 --> 11:07.320
they have no self-control when it comes to showing everything from the movies.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.400
So I would just say that going forward, you know, if you want, you know.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.120
That's why in our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord,

11:15.120 --> 11:17.160
you know, Tiger Claw posts a lot of that movie hype.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.120
This is not a read.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.800
I get it.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.880
Everybody gets into movies different ways.

11:21.880 --> 11:25.360
And some people really want to, you know, consume all that and get in the hype.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.080
So when it's something that, you know, I'm going to pick on Tiger Claw

11:28.080 --> 11:31.320
a little bit since I am the Sonic, the Ninja Turtles and that whole

11:31.320 --> 11:32.440
sorts of things that he's into.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.960
He'll post every single little commercial spot that comes up.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.840
And some people do want to see that and like buy into that hype.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.520
And it's almost like you're drip feeding some of that movie.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.000
So I get it. But we did build him essentially his own channel

11:44.160 --> 11:46.800
so that people who don't want to consume all that.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.840
Can stay out, you know what I mean?

11:48.840 --> 11:51.120
So everybody has it.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.360
There's no right or wrong way.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.960
Everybody has their different levels of fandom.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.960
And some some people when it comes to certain movies,

11:56.960 --> 11:59.720
like they don't want to know a goddamn thing about it when they go in there.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.480
And honestly, some movies are better

12:01.480 --> 12:03.640
when you don't know a single thing going into it.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.760
So, you know, it's just I think the writing could have been better

12:07.760 --> 12:08.600
probably in the movie.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.240
Like, it's funny, like because illumination movies, I don't like

12:11.240 --> 12:14.360
see them as a negative thing, even like the movies are fine.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.120
Like, sure, the characters are somewhat annoying, but that's by the

12:18.120 --> 12:21.240
I can't stand the minion stuff, but I get it.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.400
Like I get it. Yeah.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.840
Look at the other stuff like around it.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.400
Like I remember, like, for example, it's a really weird comparison, but like

12:29.000 --> 12:33.440
The Secret Life of Pets, like the beginning of that movie, they play.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.800
I remember at the song school, but it's like New York is the name of the song.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.320
And it's just like shots of like Central Park and stuff like that.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.800
But it's done so stylistically that it's just like really impactful

12:44.080 --> 12:46.760
or like sing sing is another one that they do.

12:46.760 --> 12:52.160
Like, it's a really like impactful moments in in that

12:53.120 --> 12:56.240
those movies this didn't have that.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.800
Like, it's just not like the heart is kind of missing in some of the stuff.

13:01.160 --> 13:04.280
Now to say like Chris Pratt did a fine job.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.680
I am totally fine with that.

13:05.680 --> 13:08.520
In fact, it's funny because now that the movies come out, people are like, Whoa,

13:08.920 --> 13:11.000
that Rogan didn't do a good job.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
It's like, who cares?

13:12.040 --> 13:14.840
Like, honestly, none of that detracted from the movie at all.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.200
It's just there's not much plot there.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.240
They hinted at things that.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.800
They didn't address in this movie

13:21.800 --> 13:24.080
that are probably being the next one or something,

13:24.080 --> 13:27.400
but there's just not a lot of plot.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.000
I mean, it's kind of.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.720
I don't know, like it like how

13:32.720 --> 13:36.840
how Mario gets to the Mushroom Kingdom is just kind of throwaway.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.360
Like, I mean, it's about it's about like kind of

13:41.080 --> 13:43.400
it's kind of what the 90s movie did.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.840
Honestly, it's it's very similar.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.560
Yeah. Do the games actually have a real plot?

13:49.440 --> 13:51.240
No, I don't think they do.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.080
And that's the thing.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.720
Bowser's done interesting,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.200
which it makes more sense when you look at like Odyssey and stuff.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.920
It's very similar to that.

14:03.160 --> 14:06.640
There's a lot of like a lot of Easter eggs and like things

14:06.640 --> 14:10.280
from the Mario games and the movies and stuff are not movies,

14:10.280 --> 14:14.400
but like just the games themselves, a lot of stuff taken straight out of that.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.480
The Mario Kart thing just felt really like just out of nowhere.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.160
I mean, it was fine. It was cool.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.600
I mean, it's just I don't know.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.200
I think they could have had better writers is what they they probably needed.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.760
But like, yeah, illumination.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.520
No, it's not bad when I go see the next one.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.920
Absolutely. Day one again.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.400
But like, it's just when you compare it to like Dungeons and Dragons,

14:34.400 --> 14:36.400
which was thoroughly entertaining.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.360
And I don't play a lot.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.160
I played D&D like way back in the day.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.800
But I'm like, not certainly a D&D aficionado or anything like that.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.880
That movie is just very entertaining on its own.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.080
And you have the writers that thank for that.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.960
One question. Do they mention THAC0 at all?

14:52.560 --> 14:54.200
I don't think so.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.880
Darn. Maybe in the sequel.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.080
All right, well, speak of his sequel.

14:57.080 --> 15:01.680
So even though Loki gave a, you know, kind of a is all right type of review there.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.560
And I'm kind of where I'm like, OK, I'm assuming

15:05.560 --> 15:09.520
it's not going to be the most amazing Oscar winning plot here.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.600
But as long as there's lots of Easter eggs and things that made me go,

15:13.080 --> 15:15.880
I get that, like, which it sounds like there's a lot.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.040
There's a lot of music.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.800
I'll be fine. Yeah.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.400
So lots of music stuff that's in there.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.560
That's like because it's all the orchestra takes on those.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.120
And it's like, oh, yeah.

15:25.120 --> 15:28.000
Oh, so then like so much nostalgia stuff.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.120
Like it's good in that sense.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.080
And like I like I said, I don't want to say like I didn't enjoy it.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.720
Like I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.240
It's just not like one of those movies, like,

15:37.240 --> 15:39.960
you know, Tron Legacy, where it's like, oh, man, I got to go.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.720
I got to watch. Yeah, yeah.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.280
Right now, that type of thing in IMAX.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.920
I know it's not like that.

15:46.920 --> 15:50.360
I don't really want to go to Florida, but if I'm going to go to Florida,

15:50.360 --> 15:53.040
I guess I'll get my money to Disney and go ride that new Tron ride

15:53.040 --> 15:54.640
because I really want to.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.520
Let's just put it that way.

15:56.520 --> 16:01.920
One of the hosts of a podcast I'm really fond of stuff you missed in history

16:02.920 --> 16:07.040
got to go on it early and said that it was every bit as amazing

16:07.040 --> 16:08.160
as one thinks it is.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.880
I heard a lot of the electronica stuff

16:09.880 --> 16:11.840
moved over there, too, that they they had it.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.440
But anyway, that's another topic.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.200
I want to go back to the Mario movie.

16:15.200 --> 16:19.400
And even though across the board from critics getting kind of mad reviews,

16:19.800 --> 16:22.520
that doesn't matter what matters box office.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.320
And let's take a look at a report from Variety.

16:25.320 --> 16:29.440
OK, so Variety is like a Hollywood industry type of magazine, right?

16:29.440 --> 16:30.960
And Variety is talking

16:30.960 --> 16:34.600
Super Mario Brothers movie barrels to a record two hundred

16:34.600 --> 16:37.280
and four million debut.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.680
And it talks about that the movie made two hundred

16:39.680 --> 16:42.600
and four point six million in its first five days of release.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.680
Some of you may be looking at a different number that's three hundred million.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.800
You're looking at global versus US.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.920
This is still a huge number for the US, that is for sure.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.160
This is now the biggest opening weekend of the year.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.920
Ant-Man and the Wasp was the prior record holder with about half

16:57.920 --> 16:59.600
that one hundred and six million.

16:59.600 --> 17:04.560
It is the second biggest debut ever for an animated title.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.880
It outgrows Finding Dory from 2016,

17:09.400 --> 17:11.600
at least for opening weekend, as far as it goes.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.880
We go on to talk about another one hundred

17:13.880 --> 17:16.080
seventy three million from the International Box Office.

17:16.360 --> 17:18.920
Three hundred and seventy seven million worldwide.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.000
That's off of a one hundred million dollar production budget.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.360
It was expected to collect eighty six million over the weekend.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.440
And one hundred and twenty five in its first five days of release.

17:30.680 --> 17:35.280
So this is a better than expected turnout for this movie.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.320
And I got to say, I think this is this is going to be huge

17:39.520 --> 17:41.560
for our video games going to movies.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.360
And just like we were already going this direction, right?

17:45.360 --> 17:49.440
You know, video games have been slowly taking over media,

17:50.200 --> 17:53.320
you know, especially ever since The Witcher did very well on Netflix,

17:53.320 --> 17:55.320
which, yes, I know is a book, but come on.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.440
It was the video games that, you know, was was really pushing that and so forth.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.720
And then, you know, you had the Castlevania anime.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.360
And then, you know, then you had all this stuff that happened

18:05.640 --> 18:09.080
on the Netflix side of things and all the streaming services.

18:09.320 --> 18:12.360
And then Resident Evil, they have the Resident Evil series.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.360
Well, it didn't go too well because it's canceled.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.240
No, I'm not talking about the live action anime. Yeah.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.400
Yeah, I really liked Degeneration.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.840
Resident Evil Degeneration was such a good watch.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.000
Yeah, the live action, yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.240
But and it had

18:28.240 --> 18:30.760
Anatsuchia on the soundtrack, so that was great.

18:31.120 --> 18:35.640
But now, as far as, you know, 2023 goes,

18:35.640 --> 18:39.760
you've got that one, two punch of The Last of Us on HBO.

18:39.760 --> 18:44.000
Obviously, a very different kind of thing than Super Mario Brothers.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.880
But this is this is huge.

18:45.880 --> 18:50.320
Like you're going to see a ton of video game stuff get green lit real soon.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.840
A sequel happening to this movie.

18:53.120 --> 18:57.480
Any anybody could call that that is 100 percent happening at this point.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.760
There'll be a sequel to Super Mario Brothers.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.720
I'm sure it was set up for plenty of them.

19:02.720 --> 19:06.480
Yeah. Yeah. So that that's going to happen for sure.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.600
Not a question.

19:07.600 --> 19:12.720
But now the question is, how much does Nintendo start to go? Oh.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.440
We should have maybe started to let go of some of our IPs some time ago.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.360
I understand the 90s Mario movie bombed.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.320
It wasn't received well, although it's interesting.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.520
There's been some interesting look back pieces in light of this new movie.

19:26.520 --> 19:30.360
And it's interesting to kind of read about what they were really going for

19:30.360 --> 19:33.080
with the 90s movie and some of the places that they went wrong.

19:33.440 --> 19:37.880
But here's what it was at the end of the day with the 90s Mario movie.

19:37.880 --> 19:42.360
And quite honestly, a lot of video game stuff we got in the 90s.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.880
The original Street Fighter movie, the Mortal Combat movies and so forth.

19:46.240 --> 19:51.520
A lot of those things were brought to you by people who didn't play the games.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.520
Or they knew a little bit of them or whatever.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.200
The Halo series.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.960
There's a reason I left that out for my earlier.

19:59.960 --> 20:05.840
But anyway, but you get there's also now people now that it's a different generation, right?

20:05.840 --> 20:10.640
Now that it's 2020s, as opposed to the 1990s, we're 30 years later.

20:10.880 --> 20:15.480
And the people that are making movies now are the people that grew up with this stuff.

20:16.440 --> 20:23.840
And they're making the movies that, you know, are more in line with what we wanted to see way back then.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.280
Sorry, Bobby. Yes, it was. Do the math.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.720
It was that long ago.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.640
Seriously, you know, just like look at like the Sonic the Hedgehog movie

20:31.640 --> 20:34.240
and like what trash that originally would start out as.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.160
Like, who would have thought that like that would have been that good?

20:37.440 --> 20:39.800
Like, you know, or even the sequel.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.200
Well, and I'm glad you brought up the Sonic movies, because honestly,

20:42.200 --> 20:45.240
that was also really the start of this whole recent wave.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.840
Really, I think the pandemic kind of threw things off a little bit.

20:48.840 --> 20:53.200
But I think Sonic doing well was certainly something that added to,

20:53.560 --> 20:56.720
you know, what we see with the Mario movie and so forth.

20:56.880 --> 21:01.960
So, loony barred in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, to be fair,

21:02.160 --> 21:05.200
the original Mario movie is kind of a so bad it's hilarious thing.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.920
Oh, yeah, now it is.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.600
So but so is 90s classics such as Showgirls and stuff.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.400
There's there's movies age differently.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.360
I would recommend, though, that for the Mario movie,

21:17.360 --> 21:19.480
there are a few really good documentaries

21:19.480 --> 21:22.320
about what it was intended to be with, like original

21:24.040 --> 21:25.480
storyboards and whatnot.

21:25.480 --> 21:29.160
And it could have been a really good movie.

21:29.680 --> 21:30.960
It really could have.

21:30.960 --> 21:36.480
And it got fucked over and it was being rewritten while the movie was being.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.800
Yeah, yeah.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.800
Of course, then again, Xanadu was too, but Xanadu was perfection.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.360
But I don't.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.000
There's a lot of movie critics that would not agree with you, Jamie,

21:45.000 --> 21:45.720
but it doesn't matter.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.520
They're wrong to hell with what critics think.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.280
It's what about you? It's what you think, right?

21:49.280 --> 21:52.600
Well, you know, for the record, Olivia Newton-John said that

21:52.600 --> 21:56.200
that was her favorite movie to shoot because she got to dance with Gene Kelly.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.840
And my favorite horror movie of all time is Elvira,

21:58.840 --> 22:01.280
Mistress of the Dark, and I will never change that answer.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.720
I don't care what.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.560
So you know what else we have coming out this year, which they put out

22:05.560 --> 22:09.600
the first green shot from is the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.800
Oh, yeah, because they're opening that.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.360
They're opening that the same weekend as the Saw revival or whatever

22:15.360 --> 22:16.680
they're doing with that franchise.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.720
Yeah, Saw X or X.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.520
I don't I don't know with a movie like that.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.080
You don't know is it is it meant to be called X like Mortal

22:23.080 --> 22:25.280
Kombat was or is it Saw X? I don't know.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.800
Yeah, it's October 27th.

22:27.800 --> 22:32.080
And my thing that I'm most excited about is the Jim Henson companies

22:32.080 --> 22:35.920
doing the animatronics for they're doing all the puppets and everything.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.080
So it's fun. It's going to look good.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.680
Like, I'm not even really a huge fan of Five Nights at Freddy's,

22:41.680 --> 22:43.520
but like, I just like the concept of that.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.480
Like, I'd absolutely go see that.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.400
You know, it's funny because there's a lot of people on the Internet

22:48.400 --> 22:50.880
and things I'm seeing on social media that like it's it's foolish

22:50.880 --> 22:53.400
for Five Nights at Freddy's to open the same weekend as Saw.

22:53.560 --> 22:54.800
Like it's got to go.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.800
I think the reverse is true.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.400
I think the reverse is totally true.

22:58.400 --> 23:02.320
I think Saw needs to run because they're look, those types of horror

23:02.320 --> 23:07.080
movies have their crowd, but the the do not underestimate

23:07.560 --> 23:10.920
how the kids identify like there's going to be so many kids

23:10.920 --> 23:12.920
that want to see that movie, whether they should be or not.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.160
But I would say it's I'm going to guess what it's going to probably go

23:16.160 --> 23:20.000
for PG 13, right? And probably I would guess your oldest is getting

23:20.000 --> 23:21.680
pretty close to 13, isn't he?

23:21.680 --> 23:25.000
I feel like time will be 13 by the time the movie. Oh, my God.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.560
So I mean, like, but your your oldest is like exactly

23:28.560 --> 23:30.920
who I'm thinking of who's going to carry that Five Nights movie.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.960
Like his, you know, 13 year olds are going to want to see that movie.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.800
And ironically, he probably doesn't care about the movie at all.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.640
That's fine, but it'll be good.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.160
Like, I think it'll be good

23:45.160 --> 23:48.280
if it all has to do is beat Willy's Wonderland

23:48.280 --> 23:50.840
and Willy's Wonderland is pretty amazing.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.680
But just because Nicolas Cage is in there.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.000
But like, hey, you know what?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.280
There's always room for the Five Nights at Freddy's sequel

23:56.280 --> 23:57.680
to have Nicolas Cage in it.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.120
But they've got Matthew Lillard in there.

24:00.120 --> 24:01.840
So like, I love Matthew Lillard.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.800
So I. I mean, I can't wait.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.480
It's going to be awesome.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.000
I wouldn't want to see it unless it was rated R.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.080
Oh, yeah, we'll see.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.480
I don't know. It might be violent. Who knows?

24:12.480 --> 24:14.600
You rated R, I'll go see it.

24:14.600 --> 24:18.280
I would say best case scenario, you get a Megan situation

24:18.280 --> 24:21.880
where it's PG 13 in the theaters and then there's like an uncut one

24:21.880 --> 24:24.200
that they release the best case scenario.

24:24.200 --> 24:25.760
I think that's what you get.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.360
I need to see that. I still need to see that movie.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.160
Oh, Megan. Yeah, so good. It's so good.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.480
I'm kind of disappointed that Mario outgrossed it.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.720
No, I'm kidding. It's completely expected.

24:35.720 --> 24:39.240
All right. But let's talk about some other movies that are coming.

24:39.720 --> 24:43.000
This one was probably already in talks before the Mario thing happened.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.360
But this really solidifies it.

24:44.360 --> 24:47.560
Honestly, legendary entertainment who brought us

24:48.240 --> 24:50.000
some really big franchises as of late.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.760
Jurassic World, Pokemon, Detective Pikachu, Dune, Godzilla vs.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.000
Kong, Kong, Kong.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.360
They have purchased the film and TV rights to Street Fighter.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.320
Obviously, the Capcom franchise.

25:03.560 --> 25:06.160
This is reported by The Hollywood Reporter.

25:06.160 --> 25:10.200
This means any and all future projects, meaning streaming series,

25:10.200 --> 25:12.840
anime, live action movies, all of it.

25:13.240 --> 25:17.040
And Capcom actually went so far as to confirm

25:17.320 --> 25:19.560
a new movie is in the works at Legendary.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.000
In a tweet at Street Fighter wrote a new live action

25:23.000 --> 25:26.120
Street Fighter movie is in the works, co-produced by Legendary

25:26.120 --> 25:27.640
Entertainment and Capcom.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.400
More news to come in the future.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.760
So obviously that is all we know for now.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.400
But, you know, very interesting.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.840
Well, we just got a Mortal Kombat reboot a few years ago.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.000
But, you know, the Street Fighter reboot, it's

25:39.000 --> 25:41.560
it's not going to look anything like the 90s movie.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.600
Like we have to get that out of our head.

25:44.560 --> 25:48.000
Let's not forget, though, that there also was a 2000s movie.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.600
There was. There was.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.280
It was not good. Somehow worse.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.760
It seems like it should be, you know, very significant news.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.600
But for me, it's just a Tuesday.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.920
Tiger Claw and Chat says what you did there. Funny.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.960
Tiger Claw and Chat says Street Fighter is going to be tricky to adapt.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.240
They already did it twice, and it still couldn't capture the magic of the games.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.200
I there's actually a third adaptation live action called Street Fighter

26:13.200 --> 26:17.560
Assassin's Fist, and it's I've I've started watching it

26:18.160 --> 26:19.760
actually about a week or so ago.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.400
It's actually not too bad.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.360
It's a web series.

26:22.360 --> 26:27.200
And the the whole thing was already compiled and put up in full on YouTube.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.960
And it's it's pretty good.

26:29.960 --> 26:37.640
The the style is like IRL cosplay outfit type.

26:37.640 --> 26:41.480
Like they try to mimic the game with how they look very alpha.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.560
But it's it's really good.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.000
I'm really enjoying enjoying it so far.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.760
A lot better than the other two live action attempts.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.680
But as far as this goes, it's all out the window. It doesn't matter.

26:52.680 --> 26:53.800
They're going to start from scratch.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.720
There's not going to be any references to any of this older stuff.

26:55.720 --> 27:00.080
Maybe if you're lucky, you get either a nod to Raul Julia,

27:00.080 --> 27:02.880
which I think you'd see that like maybe a painting of him or something

27:02.880 --> 27:04.160
that's in the background in a scene.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.560
You see like you'll see something like that

27:06.560 --> 27:10.400
or that the Tuesday line will somehow sneak its way into the movie.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.720
That's that's it. That's all you're going to get.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.000
I'm saying it now, Kylie Minogue.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.520
Hell yeah, I would take Kylie Minogue as Kami or even a little amazing.

27:19.560 --> 27:23.600
She could she could even cameo as like the head of British intelligence

27:23.600 --> 27:25.520
or whatever, you know, whatever Kami comes from.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.440
You know, the reason she was in it,

27:28.440 --> 27:31.240
you know, the reason why she was in that movie to begin with is because

27:31.560 --> 27:35.040
they filmed the first part of it in Thailand and then

27:35.440 --> 27:39.240
they had to leave due to expenses and film the rest of it in Australia.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.240
And they needed an Australian actor.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.640
Oh, how funny.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.440
And I'll go ahead and repeat what I said before the show,

27:45.440 --> 27:49.920
that Sawada's character was because the actor I need

27:49.920 --> 27:52.680
I don't remember his given name, but I know his name is Sawada.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.800
They wanted him to play for you, but they had already cast for you.

27:56.280 --> 28:00.440
So they basically made

28:00.440 --> 28:03.760
they made a character for him and everyone loves him because he's amazing.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.600
Yeah, at least he's more loved than Cole.

28:07.400 --> 28:12.160
The reason why there are not as at the time as well-known actors in it

28:12.160 --> 28:15.680
was because it put all of their hiring budget into getting Jean-Claude Van Damme.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.880
Hmm. OK, bring him back.

28:18.880 --> 28:20.760
It's Colonel Guile. He could still do it.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.120
Nobody from the older movies is coming back.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.680
Maybe a cameo, but that's it.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.000
Have Jean-Claude Van Damme play Bison.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.960
No, Jean-Claude Van Damme is going to be nowhere near this movie.

28:30.440 --> 28:34.880
Or wait, no, bring him back as a really angry, grizzled Rolento.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.240
No, they don't they don't want ties to the old stuff.

28:37.240 --> 28:38.920
This is going to be brand new.

28:38.920 --> 28:43.000
I know, I know. But I could totally see him playing Rolento now.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.680
I'm curious if they adapt Street Fighter II,

28:46.680 --> 28:48.880
which is kind of like the most well known with those characters,

28:48.880 --> 28:53.280
or if they start to incorporate, you know, more expanded universe,

28:53.280 --> 28:54.800
because they're really just the mainline universe.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.720
I'm talking about the rosters for four or five and soon to be six.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.960
If we start to see some of those characters come into play,

28:59.960 --> 29:03.040
or if it's if like they do two first and then if it does well,

29:03.040 --> 29:06.240
maybe we'll see some of those more expanded roster characters in a sequel.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.640
I don't know. I don't know.

29:07.640 --> 29:10.080
This is going to come from a different creative team who grew up with it.

29:10.560 --> 29:13.160
It's not it's going to be better.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.240
It has to be. It has to be.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.040
It can't be worse than the Chun-Li movie.

29:19.080 --> 29:25.600
So anyway, but there are some good names in that that first live action movie.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.480
Oh, no, there were.

29:26.480 --> 29:32.120
Yeah, West Duty and I mean, some pretty amazing people.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.120
And we had the future Leatherface.

29:34.520 --> 29:37.840
Mm hmm. He played Zangief.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.800
Yeah, we had a lot of, you know, for the time, big names in that movie.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.160
And somebody in chat had said to kind of that that trivia fact that, oh,

29:44.160 --> 29:46.920
Julia only did that movie because his grandkids wanted him to.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.800
And he did it like a favor to them.

29:48.800 --> 29:52.680
And he was also ridiculously sick.

29:53.040 --> 29:57.800
Yeah. So the reason that everyone was supposed to go through weeks

29:57.800 --> 30:04.000
of of martial arts training while he filmed his scenes first.

30:05.160 --> 30:08.560
But he was so sick that they actually had to have

30:08.560 --> 30:11.240
everyone do their scenes while he recovered.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.680
And he was like the outfit that he wore was simply

30:16.680 --> 30:19.680
to hide just how thin he had become.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.720
Well, he's he's the reason to see that movie if, you know,

30:22.720 --> 30:25.920
to put as much as there are other interesting actors and actresses.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.880
Every movie he's in. Yeah.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.840
But anyway, it's such a good villain.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.160
Back to the Mario and you know what this is going to mean for the future.

30:33.160 --> 30:38.400
I wonder now, because obviously the 90s movie and that whole experience

30:38.680 --> 30:43.120
scared Nintendo away from making movies based off their IP for a very long time,

30:43.760 --> 30:48.960
save the occasional maybe like anime because there was like an animal crossing thing.

30:48.960 --> 30:52.000
Right. So very rare sort of thing.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.840
I'm very curious to see if they start to green light

30:56.840 --> 30:58.680
some more of their stuff to become movies.

30:58.680 --> 31:04.080
And I, I really do think the success of this movie means in the next five years,

31:04.080 --> 31:06.520
we're going to get that holy grail of video game adaptations.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.320
Everyone's what everyone wants.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.320
And that's The Legend of Zelda as a movie.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.440
I have no idea how they tackle it.

31:12.440 --> 31:17.560
What game they try to go for, if it would be a Breath of the Wild or it doesn't really matter.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.680
But I think Zelda becomes a movie in the next five years based off the success of Mario.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.560
It has to. It has to.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.360
Anyway, it'd be interesting to see what develops, but I'm looking forward to seeing

31:32.360 --> 31:35.800
the Mario movie at some point and catching all those references, that's for sure.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.320
All right, let's move on.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.280
We got to get into more news this week and our gaming weeks.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.200
Yeah, one thing before that, though.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.360
Yeah, because I was asked to say so.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.320
Remember, I messaged you.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.360
We have a message from Sturlock.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.080
He lost his dad this morning very suddenly.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.600
And he said to not take the ones you love for granted.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.000
And I think that everyone needs to find

32:02.360 --> 32:04.840
the people that they care about in their lives and tell them so.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.760
Well, very sorry to hear that news, Sturlock, but we're all thinking of you.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.160
And your family, both biological and chosen at this time.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.120
So sending love.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.680
All right. Well, hard to transition from that.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.560
But let's do what we usually do and talk about our gaming weeks

32:22.560 --> 32:24.280
and the types of video games we've been playing this week.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.680
So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

32:27.960 --> 32:30.640
It was kind of the usual.

32:31.360 --> 32:35.280
I played more Beatlemania Pinball, which we are going to be buying it.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.920
Oh, you are. OK, we are

32:38.920 --> 32:42.440
probably going to do a trade and a buy.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.800
And but I freaking love it.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.040
I love it. I sing along with it, which is funny

32:47.040 --> 32:50.560
because it's not even my favorite era of Beatles.

32:50.560 --> 32:54.520
And then I played Marvel Midnight Suns.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.560
I'm actually going to be doing that

32:55.560 --> 32:58.800
instead of my retro night through the end of the month, because I've

32:59.320 --> 33:02.840
I've been feeling that a little bit more lately, and I need to get my brain

33:02.840 --> 33:04.800
back into the mindset for Star Ocean.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.000
I've been playing

33:08.960 --> 33:12.640
I actually bought Meet Your Maker for the cosmetics,

33:14.280 --> 33:16.160
but I played it before.

33:16.160 --> 33:20.800
But I'm definitely going to try to give the game another another shot.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.560
Of course, I'm playing Dead by Daylight.

33:24.560 --> 33:26.680
I hit Eerie One again for Survivor.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.920
I guess I'm a Survivor main now.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.720
What's wrong with me, Rob? What's wrong with me?

33:32.800 --> 33:35.240
You have your own little squad that you run with now,

33:35.240 --> 33:37.120
and when you play killer, you don't get to play with your friends.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.240
So it's I mean, that's the big thing that change.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.560
Go back and build my skills back up for my adepts,

33:43.280 --> 33:45.880
which I will be working on a little bit on the 19th

33:45.880 --> 33:49.480
on my my my birthday party on my channel.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.280
It is not your fault, Gwen.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.040
I'm going to tell you this right now.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.920
You helped me because I wanted cosmetics.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.160
It's the cosmetic addict's fault.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.600
You you facilitated it,

34:03.080 --> 34:05.360
but I wanted the the cosmetics.

34:05.600 --> 34:09.600
I'm going to I'm going to give Gwen some big credit because she's been with you

34:09.600 --> 34:12.080
from the very beginning when streaming Survivor and so forth.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.160
She's been she's been the the I don't know, the

34:15.640 --> 34:17.400
I'm not going to say it's your fault.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.440
I'm going to say that you facilitated a lot of it. Yes.

34:20.440 --> 34:22.920
You facilitated a lot of it.

34:22.920 --> 34:27.760
So look, she's she's taken many hits and hooks, so you don't have to, OK?

34:28.600 --> 34:30.800
That's true. That is absolutely true.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.800
She is a founding member of Team Yeet.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.880
I told you about how Team Yeet came about, right?

34:35.880 --> 34:37.280
Oh, yeah, I think I was there that night.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.560
Y'all did that. Yeah.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.840
Yeah, that was fun.

34:39.840 --> 34:43.000
And we're going to be we're going to have more Team Yeet action.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.400
Just letting y'all know.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.720
But but no, I like to say that

34:47.720 --> 34:50.760
it's not so much of a blame thing as a facilitation.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.920
I the wheels were in motion and actually

34:54.200 --> 34:57.480
the first person I played Survivor with people

34:57.760 --> 35:00.760
was Nick and Isaaco.

35:01.480 --> 35:05.840
When they were still doing the the Nuzlocke thing.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.440
But I bought a game today.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.080
I ordered it so that we would get it when it comes out.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.640
I ordered Osmond.

35:14.640 --> 35:19.640
Oh, which for people who actually keep up with episode numbers.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.160
And I looked it up.

35:21.160 --> 35:25.720
It was episode seven hundred and ninety four that I did Osmond,

35:26.720 --> 35:34.880
which was a game that was done by the designer of

35:36.280 --> 35:41.600
of Capcom staff, Yotsui Koichi, who did Strider.

35:42.320 --> 35:46.200
And Osmond was the first unofficial sequel to Strider.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.960
And it's such a good game, but it's very obviously a Strider clone.

35:52.640 --> 35:57.920
But I I'm not looking at anything

35:57.920 --> 36:02.440
that Bobby says right now because I ordered for delivery.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.240
But it's a game that's fond in our house.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.000
You know, Dan's favorite game is Strider.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.360
Yep. And, you know, we can't all have the great taste

36:12.360 --> 36:14.560
to put the guardian legend at the top of our list.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.000
But Strider is up there.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.080
So I allow it. I allow it.

36:19.680 --> 36:26.800
And that's really about I'm playing my stupid word game again to like

36:27.520 --> 36:29.600
there's almost no challenge anymore.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.560
I need I need something that has I need a game

36:32.560 --> 36:35.600
like like word scapes that has a larger vocabulary.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.600
Because I know these words.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.800
There are some interesting words that pop in there that I'm like,

36:46.160 --> 36:49.480
I don't know how people, you know, would know these otherwise,

36:49.480 --> 36:52.560
but they do in there.

36:52.560 --> 36:57.000
And oh, gosh, Bobby, I really want what rush.

36:57.640 --> 37:01.160
I think we had the Mandalorian topper when we had the Mandalorian.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.360
We have a topper for

37:06.920 --> 37:07.960
Black Knight, sort of.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.040
What's a pinball topper?

37:09.040 --> 37:11.640
Is that the little figure that like hooks to the top of the machine?

37:11.760 --> 37:13.640
OK, I've seen those. Yeah, the thing on top.

37:13.640 --> 37:17.680
Yeah, I have the one for for Black Knight, sort of rage.

37:17.720 --> 37:20.280
The thing is, we don't have a Black Knight, sort of rage.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.760
Oops. Awesome table.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.400
Our Weird Al should be coming in a couple of months, too.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.400
We're going to be broke.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.120
But anyway, that that's been the gaming,

37:32.120 --> 37:35.640
and I'm actually hoping to get some Among Us time in this week.

37:35.640 --> 37:36.960
That would be fun.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.000
It's awesome.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.440
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

37:40.440 --> 37:42.000
Um, it was just Minecraft.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.800
I've been working on stuff for my modded series,

37:45.800 --> 37:49.920
and I finished the build in that and

37:51.360 --> 37:53.400
just get into editing the video now.

37:54.160 --> 37:55.440
So hopefully we'll get that soon.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.440
Still no word on the contest thing.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.160
It's been over almost four weeks now.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.960
We'll be coming up on four weeks of this Wednesday. So.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.560
I mean, I don't know.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.160
Aside from that, though,

38:09.200 --> 38:12.960
there was a cool like April 1st version of Minecraft

38:12.960 --> 38:15.640
with the vote update, so I've been filming stuff on there as well.

38:16.840 --> 38:19.320
Hopefully I'll make a video out of that, too.

38:19.360 --> 38:22.560
I haven't really been playing too much of that.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.120
But I'm trying to get lots of videos.

38:24.120 --> 38:27.560
I took two days off this week to hopefully do some of that,

38:27.560 --> 38:30.840
but I didn't get to a lot of it. So.

38:31.920 --> 38:35.280
Hopefully this week, maybe today, I don't know.

38:37.160 --> 38:38.920
All right. My gaming week.

38:38.920 --> 38:42.280
So before I get to the actual games, I have an interesting story

38:42.280 --> 38:43.800
I have to kind of tell here on OLR.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.480
And it's kind of what's been going on in my personal life the last few weeks.

38:46.480 --> 38:50.560
So last week, I couldn't really talk about this,

38:50.560 --> 38:52.840
but I can now because everything wrapped up on Friday.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.560
But for the last two weeks, I've been on jury duty.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.600
So it's, you know, something that you have to do once in a while,

38:59.600 --> 39:02.200
you know, especially if your employer pays for it like mine does.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.640
And it's not going to cause you a hardship.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.600
I get to do that next week. Oh, boy.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.400
Maybe you'll end up in the same place

39:07.400 --> 39:09.160
I was because they just wrapped everything on Friday.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.200
But anyway, here's the thing.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.440
Here's the interesting story about that whole thing.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.840
I don't really want to talk about the specifics of the case,

39:15.840 --> 39:17.760
because quite honestly,

39:17.760 --> 39:22.280
my brain hurts from the days of deliberations on all that.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.360
And that's all I'm going to say.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.760
So it's just, yeah.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.880
But here's the funny, actual funny part.

39:27.560 --> 39:30.240
So, you know, when they're doing the jury selection,

39:30.240 --> 39:32.800
which takes like a day and a half, right?

39:32.800 --> 39:34.960
You know, they're going through and they're interviewing everybody.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.920
And I realized I didn't realize it right away,

39:36.920 --> 39:38.280
but I realized on a break,

39:38.280 --> 39:41.240
we were all kind of sitting out from the hall and I'm looking across from him,

39:41.240 --> 39:44.920
like, this guy looks kind of familiar. And I'm like, Drew?

39:45.760 --> 39:49.280
And he's like, yeah, hi. I was wondering when you noticed me. Yeah.

39:49.320 --> 39:53.760
Intern Drew and I were on the same fucking case at jury duty. How's that?

39:53.760 --> 39:57.680
What a small world is that? So for those that don't know, intern Drew,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.280
when we were doing the show more live, you know,

40:00.280 --> 40:04.240
we'd have like the actual like people in the, in the room, not just us,

40:04.240 --> 40:05.840
but we had guests all the time and all that stuff.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.400
So Drew was infamous when we used to do this show in the garage.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.640
He knocked over the soundboard in the middle of one show. It was really funny.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.800
But anyway, but here's, here's why that's funny and why I bring it up.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.280
Because as part of the whole process,

40:18.280 --> 40:20.320
when they're deciding who's going to be on the jury and who's not,

40:20.680 --> 40:24.280
they actually ask you a series of question. And one of them is,

40:24.480 --> 40:29.040
do you know any of the other jurors? And I had to be like, actually,

40:29.040 --> 40:34.000
yes I do. And they probably don't hear that one a lot. And they're like,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.320
well, who do you know? And I pointed it out. And so how do you know him?

40:38.360 --> 40:39.920
And I had to say, well, we,

40:39.920 --> 40:44.720
we run in similar nerdy gaming type of circles and he's been on my podcast.

40:44.720 --> 40:49.080
And then the judge wants to ask about the podcast and wants to ask like, am I,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.240
do I know not to talk about the case on the podcast?

40:51.240 --> 40:53.760
Which obviously I did not last week when this was still going on.

40:53.760 --> 40:56.640
I can say stuff now. I don't want to talk about the case anyways.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.760
I'm not going to tell you those specifics, but I'll tell you, you know,

40:59.800 --> 41:01.160
about this. Cause it's funny.

41:01.440 --> 41:06.280
And the fact that now it's on official record legal

41:06.280 --> 41:11.000
record that this podcast exists finally acknowledgement in

41:11.000 --> 41:14.120
some form or the other, all because I knew Drew,

41:14.280 --> 41:18.000
but I guess the punchline to all that drew did not get selected for the jury

41:18.000 --> 41:22.800
because they pulled like 60 people into that room and they had the jury after

41:22.800 --> 41:24.000
the first 20 or so.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.080
So they never got to like two thirds of that room had to come there for like

41:27.080 --> 41:30.680
two days, never to even get called up. And Drew was one of those folks.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.800
So he got to go, but I had,

41:33.000 --> 41:37.880
I had to text him after it was done going like you won't believe how that

41:37.880 --> 41:41.880
went. So anyway,

41:42.840 --> 41:45.000
that's out. Oh, the other interesting thing about that,

41:45.000 --> 41:49.160
I have to give a hello to any of the other jurors that I met who might be

41:49.160 --> 41:49.560
listening.

41:49.560 --> 41:53.560
Cause I'm going to tell you there were more people legitimately interested in my

41:53.560 --> 41:57.560
podcast at jury duty than there were the last E3 I went to.

41:58.120 --> 42:01.960
So if any of the jurors I was on the case with actually made it this far into

42:01.960 --> 42:04.160
the podcast, like thank you for,

42:04.360 --> 42:07.040
cause God knows you heard enough of me the last two days.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.040
Thank you for being here this far into the show.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.520
And I'm glad you enjoy it and all that good stuff. But that was,

42:12.560 --> 42:17.240
that was just a isn't that interesting. Wow. Type of thing. Small world, right?

42:17.280 --> 42:21.640
Small world. So I see, I see Drew twice a week. I know that's why,

42:21.640 --> 42:24.440
that's why I texted you going, um, I need Drew's contact info.

42:24.480 --> 42:27.080
Like after it was done, I'm sure that came out in the blue. Like,

42:27.080 --> 42:28.520
why does Rob want to talk to Drew?

42:28.520 --> 42:31.440
But I was able to tell you cause it was after Friday at that point. But yeah,

42:31.800 --> 42:36.440
I remember Drew saying that he wasn't chosen for a case at work and I was like,

42:36.440 --> 42:38.840
Oh, okay. You know, and then now this comes up.

42:38.840 --> 42:39.840
Guess who was,

42:42.320 --> 42:44.240
but it was, it was literally luck of the draw.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.880
Like my number was 11 in the list, which puts you,

42:48.920 --> 42:50.200
it's one of the first 12.

42:50.240 --> 42:53.640
So if the prosecution or defense doesn't kick you at that point,

42:53.840 --> 42:56.360
based on the answers to your question, you're stuck. You're there.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.440
I will say this is the irony.

42:58.440 --> 43:02.760
So this is the second case I've ever sat on jury for the last one was in 2006,

43:02.960 --> 43:05.960
long time ago. The show was still going, but it was a long time ago, right?

43:06.360 --> 43:09.480
I was also juror 11 in that case.

43:10.080 --> 43:13.840
So that number is fucking cursed. That's all I have to say.

43:14.800 --> 43:17.360
It's what I shouldn't, I shouldn't it, you know,

43:17.400 --> 43:21.200
I was really irritated at first because you know, my day job and all this stuff,

43:21.200 --> 43:23.880
but then you get to a certain point where you're invested in it and you're like,

43:23.920 --> 43:28.280
all right, I want to give this a fair shot. I want to do what's right.

43:28.320 --> 43:31.720
I want to, you know, so yeah, I think it'll be fun. Oh yeah.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.880
I was telling Shane about it and he was like, man,

43:34.880 --> 43:37.200
I never get called for jury duty. I want to do it. And I'm like,

43:37.720 --> 43:41.840
next time I get a summons, you can have it. Just, just go tell them you're me.

43:41.920 --> 43:42.960
It wouldn't be so bad.

43:42.960 --> 43:47.280
Like if I wasn't in Sacramento County cause driving, I hate driving downtown.

43:47.400 --> 43:51.200
That's really it. Like it is the worst for me. I got to go home on lunch.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.400
Oh, well, lucky you. But like, um,

43:54.960 --> 43:59.320
I'm going to be that far from where I live if it, if it wasn't like, you know,

43:59.880 --> 44:03.800
driving downtown and parking and all that, like the parking lots and.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.000
The parking lot is not that bad anymore.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.160
The parking lot really isn't bad.

44:07.160 --> 44:11.480
I think they call less people because of COVID that it was not bad at all.

44:12.240 --> 44:15.280
OK, well, that's good at least because it used to be a nightmare

44:15.280 --> 44:16.560
just to do all that stuff.

44:16.600 --> 44:20.320
No, I mean, that said though, at least I would enjoy like the local eateries

44:20.320 --> 44:22.840
around there. They've got a really nice, like New York style,

44:22.880 --> 44:26.760
or it's actually like a New York pizza chain or pizza place,

44:27.120 --> 44:28.880
authentic New York stuff. They have that there.

44:28.880 --> 44:33.200
Then they have like an authentic French soup place. That's also awesome. So,

44:33.600 --> 44:34.440
uh, hopefully.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.320
As the show and how to Matt and chat says, you know,

44:38.320 --> 44:41.520
some legal intern had to listen to the show to make sure Rob didn't say

44:41.520 --> 44:45.280
anything. I don't think so. No, I, I, yeah,

44:45.280 --> 44:47.520
because I don't think they ever asked the name. I'm trying to remember.

44:47.520 --> 44:52.120
I don't think she ever asked the name of it, but it's, what am I going to say?

44:52.200 --> 44:54.280
Like, if I told you what the case was about,

44:54.320 --> 44:59.120
it literally has nothing to do with anything that ever comes up on this program.

44:59.360 --> 45:03.640
So it's like, why would I bring it up? So there's no, there's no point. So,

45:05.560 --> 45:08.480
um, but yeah, so then, but, but there was,

45:08.520 --> 45:12.440
so one of the people who had asked about my show was a juror who ultimately did

45:12.480 --> 45:16.600
get kicked off. So she might've heard last week's show. I don't know.

45:16.600 --> 45:20.040
If you're out there, hi, hi. Say, say hello, drop me a line on Twitter at Mr.

45:20.040 --> 45:24.120
Rob Roberts. So let's say, say hello or whatever. Um, but yeah,

45:24.160 --> 45:26.120
there was some, it was, uh, one of the other days I was,

45:26.160 --> 45:29.200
so I didn't play a lot of games there at the courthouse cause you can't,

45:29.200 --> 45:32.200
they're very strict. Like you cannot have your phones on in the courtroom just,

45:32.400 --> 45:33.840
but when you're in the hallway killing time,

45:33.840 --> 45:35.960
I would sit there and I'd have Pokemon go open.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.640
And I was like catching stuff that was spawning around the courthouse.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.920
And it did catch the attention of one of the other jurors who came up with you

45:41.920 --> 45:44.560
play Pokemon go. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:44.560 --> 45:47.840
I'm a little bit like trying to hide it. Like, no, that's for nerds.

45:48.800 --> 45:53.360
Yeah. I play Pokemon go traded friend codes and all that.

45:53.360 --> 45:57.240
So yeah, I forgot to mention, I actually, uh, opened up,

45:57.280 --> 46:02.280
I installed an opened up ingress this weekend. Did you just, just to see,

46:02.480 --> 46:03.320
you know,

46:03.800 --> 46:08.520
what was going on and like where I was at in Rancho it was all gray.

46:08.560 --> 46:09.960
Like all of it was gray.

46:09.960 --> 46:13.760
There's a lot less people that play than they used to.

46:14.440 --> 46:17.760
But, uh, yeah, I checked that out and I checked out Orna. Orna, I,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.880
I can't navigate it anymore. It's just completely different now.

46:21.880 --> 46:26.280
So I'm lost in that and ingress. I couldn't do anything. So I was like, eh,

46:26.440 --> 46:28.080
uninstall. I don't know.

46:28.360 --> 46:31.320
I understand. All right. So games I did play, that's enough about my outfit,

46:31.320 --> 46:34.800
but I thought you'd all enjoy that story about how OLR sort of ended up on the

46:34.800 --> 46:37.040
public record. Um, anyhow, uh,

46:37.160 --> 46:38.920
so games I've played this week,

46:38.920 --> 46:41.600
I've still continuing in Pokemon legends are chaos. Uh,

46:41.600 --> 46:44.440
I actually am past the point I was at the first time I played through that

46:44.440 --> 46:44.920
game.

46:44.920 --> 46:48.040
There's something about Pokemon games where like if I start them a year after

46:48.040 --> 46:51.040
they come out, I get a lot for actually that games out game has been out,

46:51.040 --> 46:52.240
I think more like two years, but still,

46:52.440 --> 46:56.960
I get a lot farther if I play after it's out and so forth than I do the first

46:56.960 --> 47:00.200
time. I'm actually really enjoying like the game and this play through.

47:00.200 --> 47:02.440
And I do plan on finishing it, uh,

47:02.480 --> 47:06.400
before the pixel remasters release on console. Uh, thank you depth.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.960
I couldn't remember if look pandemic lockdowns completely changed my sense of

47:09.960 --> 47:11.520
time. I couldn't remember if it was one or two years.

47:11.520 --> 47:12.440
So it's only one year old.

47:12.440 --> 47:15.720
So I guess I beat sword and shield about a year after they came out.

47:15.720 --> 47:18.720
So I guess I'm right on schedule and I'll probably finally get to violet and

47:18.720 --> 47:23.360
scarlet this fall. So, Hey, it, it works out that way. But, um, yeah,

47:23.360 --> 47:24.440
so I've been playing a lot of that,

47:24.440 --> 47:28.120
but I'm still continuing on some old favorites, including, uh, Diablo three.

47:28.120 --> 47:31.400
I'm at like paragraph 550 for the current season. Uh,

47:31.400 --> 47:34.160
fall fantasy 14 been playing a little bit of that. Uh, even,

47:34.160 --> 47:36.480
I even dipped into some dead by daylight, uh,

47:36.480 --> 47:40.760
here and there a little bit this week. And, um, what else?

47:40.760 --> 47:43.840
There was something else I played. I can't remember.

47:43.840 --> 47:47.000
So it must not have been that big a deal, I guess. But, um, yeah, I just been,

47:47.000 --> 47:50.320
you know, doing different stuff, filling time and yeah,

47:50.320 --> 47:53.440
been enjoying the Pokemon play through that's for sure. So, uh,

47:53.480 --> 47:56.960
looking forward to finishing up that up. All right. Uh,

47:57.000 --> 48:00.480
we're going to get into some more gaming news and what's going on around the

48:00.560 --> 48:04.240
industry and gaming culture as well. So let's get to it.

48:04.240 --> 48:05.600
Loki wants to start us off.

48:06.520 --> 48:11.040
So Microsoft doesn't want you to use their consoles for emulation,

48:11.800 --> 48:13.520
um, is what they're trying to do.

48:13.520 --> 48:18.040
So they've basically cracked down on folks using, uh,

48:18.080 --> 48:23.080
emulators that were installed using the dev mode that you can put your Xbox

48:23.920 --> 48:27.200
series S or X in, I think you can do that with the Xbox one,

48:27.200 --> 48:31.440
but specifically the Xbox X and S, um,

48:31.480 --> 48:35.000
allowing you to run those apps like retro arts, uh,

48:35.040 --> 48:38.880
PP SPP and duck station, um,

48:38.960 --> 48:43.200
using the universal windows platform versions of those games.

48:44.400 --> 48:48.800
Um, so now they're basically cracking down on those, uh,

48:49.120 --> 48:50.880
according to one of the developers.

48:51.280 --> 48:54.200
So essentially Microsoft cracked down on my uploads, uh,

48:54.200 --> 48:59.160
where they used to last months to weeks to days and until now. Um,

48:59.200 --> 49:03.160
so I would simply re upload the apps whenever they were taken down to get

49:03.160 --> 49:05.440
newcomers and everyone back up and running.

49:06.440 --> 49:10.480
But it says the crackdown started ramp up around the end of summer going into

49:10.480 --> 49:13.720
autumn, where they dealt with daily tech downs for awhile.

49:13.720 --> 49:16.920
So the day after they went up, they'd be taken down.

49:17.160 --> 49:20.600
We managed to find a way to get them the last three days. Um,

49:20.600 --> 49:24.560
so I'm not naming them retro arch instead using randomized names.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.320
Um, but yeah,

49:27.320 --> 49:32.080
they're just increasingly being taken down if they're seen to be like a emulator

49:32.080 --> 49:34.520
or something like that. So you're just gonna,

49:34.560 --> 49:38.920
you're just gonna have to use the PC like everybody else or,

49:38.920 --> 49:41.920
or a steam deck or whatever else that you want to run it on.

49:41.960 --> 49:46.120
Well, I imagine Microsoft just wants nothing to do with the perception. Again,

49:46.120 --> 49:48.480
it's, it's not always about what's right and wrong,

49:48.480 --> 49:49.840
but it's about the perception, right?

49:49.840 --> 49:53.120
And Microsoft does not even want that perception of, look,

49:53.120 --> 49:57.560
you can play Zelda on your Xbox just by using this specific, they don't want,

49:57.560 --> 49:58.120
they don't want that.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.760
That's not what the modes for anyways.

49:59.760 --> 50:04.200
The mode is meant for people developing games to be able to test them on the

50:04.200 --> 50:06.280
hardware that they are being developed for,

50:06.280 --> 50:10.640
not to install apps to run side layers. Yeah. Yeah.

50:10.720 --> 50:13.600
So besides you have the dolphin emulator coming to steam still,

50:13.600 --> 50:16.760
if that is to be, that is still on track, right? As far as we know,

50:16.800 --> 50:20.600
we haven't seen a shutdown or anything. It's going to be interesting. So,

50:21.280 --> 50:24.000
all right, we'll see. All right, moving on.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.560
Let's talk about one of my favorite games. No Man's Sky.

50:26.600 --> 50:31.360
No Man's Sky got another update this week. I mean, it's, it's been six weeks.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.320
There must be another update.

50:32.560 --> 50:36.280
This update is called the interceptor update and the interceptor update will

50:36.280 --> 50:40.360
actually add new ships to the game as well as something called corrupt worlds.

50:40.960 --> 50:44.960
So these planets can turn into purple hazed worlds that have purple crystals.

50:45.200 --> 50:49.000
And then it basically has changed a little bit of the sentinels.

50:49.160 --> 50:52.160
So there are some new sentinel types. So some new enemies there,

50:52.160 --> 50:55.680
they're spider-like and yes, crab-like machines.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.280
They're not giant enemy crabs though.

50:57.280 --> 50:59.040
They're small enemy crabs just for the record.

50:59.160 --> 51:01.040
If there's purple hazes on those planets,

51:01.040 --> 51:02.880
have you run into captain Jimi Hendrix?

51:03.520 --> 51:07.560
No, no I have not. But I can, let me see,

51:07.560 --> 51:10.640
there was a trailer for this out somewhere and of course I don't have it up,

51:10.640 --> 51:11.840
but let me see if I can find it.

51:12.520 --> 51:13.960
And purple crystals on everything.

51:13.960 --> 51:16.760
That's starting to sound like the suicide squad trailer.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.560
Yeah, but it actually looks, oops, sorry.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.040
Little Xbox noise there in the background,

51:21.040 --> 51:26.040
but that's because I actually have what that looks like

51:26.040 --> 51:27.800
here on the side. Hold on. I'm multitasking.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.640
Cause the husband just brought me coffee. Thank you.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.640
Let me show you this real quick here on the other monitor,

51:33.640 --> 51:38.360
what this looks like while I talk about this. Sorry. There we go. Okay.

51:39.360 --> 51:43.200
So you can see that like it's these corrupt world planets look very purply

51:43.200 --> 51:44.440
and so forth is what they have.

51:44.640 --> 51:48.760
They're also talking improved visuals and new features for virtual reality.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.920
So I know that just went live not that long ago,

51:51.040 --> 51:54.360
but they've done some perfections on that. And then of course,

51:54.360 --> 51:56.920
these new Sentinel type ships are in there too.

51:57.080 --> 51:59.600
There's also an ability called the anti-gravity well,

51:59.600 --> 52:04.280
that could be very interesting and fun. Also improvements focused on Xbox.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.160
I always thought the game looked fine on Xbox,

52:06.160 --> 52:07.120
but I guess there are some,

52:07.120 --> 52:10.600
some imperfections that they were ironing out for smooth and consistent

52:10.600 --> 52:13.880
frame rate. Anyway, that is all out now. Again,

52:13.880 --> 52:16.800
that is the no man's sky interceptor update.

52:17.040 --> 52:21.520
Here's the thing for me and why I'm not like super excited about this is that

52:21.520 --> 52:24.840
this is a little more of a combat focused update. It sounds like,

52:24.840 --> 52:26.400
especially with the upgrades to Sentinels.

52:26.840 --> 52:31.680
And I did not particularly care for the last combat update that they did.

52:31.960 --> 52:35.480
Why did my co-hosts go gray all of a sudden? Uh oh.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.360
Are you all still there? Oh, that was so weird. Sorry. Yeah, that was weird.

52:40.360 --> 52:44.520
Anyway. Um, but, um, yeah, so it's,

52:44.520 --> 52:48.240
it's neat that this updates out. I'm not super enthused about combat updates,

52:48.240 --> 52:52.960
but I do appreciate that the difficulty tuning update will allow you to

52:52.960 --> 52:56.320
change the difficulty, uh, down so that you don't see these as much.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.200
I just think, um,

53:00.920 --> 53:04.960
I just think that, um, the next expedition, whenever that comes out,

53:04.960 --> 53:06.960
because they didn't, this didn't launch with an expedition,

53:06.960 --> 53:09.240
which I thought was interesting. Cause it was about time for one.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.960
Maybe they're ironing out. Cause I feel like they did this last time.

53:11.960 --> 53:14.880
They're ironing out all the bugs before they launch it. Uh,

53:14.920 --> 53:18.320
we'll probably focus on this stuff. And I don't know if I'm going to like that.

53:19.080 --> 53:23.040
Uh, because I'm not super big on the combat. It can be difficult sometimes,

53:23.040 --> 53:26.400
but we'll see. Maybe I love the game. Don't get me wrong.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.920
This is just the one area of the game.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.840
I don't like as much as the other areas like exploration and building and all

53:30.840 --> 53:34.480
that stuff. The purple planets look cool though. I will say that. So,

53:35.040 --> 53:37.560
uh, a big hello to Marissa Meisel, who's in our chat saying,

53:37.560 --> 53:41.200
I thought court cases on these issues tend to rule that you can do what you

53:41.200 --> 53:44.400
want with your product after you buy it. Not endorsing law breaking,

53:44.400 --> 53:47.040
but you get the idea. Yeah, you're right. Marissa,

53:47.080 --> 53:51.200
like you can do whatever you want with your Xbox. It's it's your Xbox, right? Uh,

53:51.240 --> 53:54.600
but Microsoft still, still doesn't want that perception out there.

53:54.840 --> 53:59.760
They still have the right to what they can and they can't put on the store and

53:59.760 --> 54:00.280
you know,

54:00.280 --> 54:03.920
putting the blocks in there so that you can't install your own stuff because

54:03.920 --> 54:05.600
it's also a store place, right?

54:05.960 --> 54:09.040
But if you do find a way to sideload apps and so forth,

54:09.240 --> 54:12.680
then that's on you and you can essentially do what you want. Uh,

54:12.680 --> 54:16.960
that all goes back to the PlayStation three, I want to say, and the other OS,

54:17.160 --> 54:18.280
remember the government,

54:18.320 --> 54:23.280
the government loved PlayStation three because it was a powerful

54:23.280 --> 54:25.160
supercomputer for not too expensive.

54:25.440 --> 54:28.240
But then when they got rid of the other OS saying that actually affected the

54:28.240 --> 54:31.600
government, but you didn't have to update. What's that?

54:32.520 --> 54:36.160
Wasn't it the PS2 that ran Linux? No, it was PS3. No, it was PS3. Yeah.

54:36.880 --> 54:40.640
They may have had a PS2 Linux thing. Yeah, they may have had a PS2, but not,

54:40.640 --> 54:44.520
not like officially supported. So anyway.

54:45.320 --> 54:48.680
All right. Um, but that is the No Man's Sky Interceptor update.

54:48.680 --> 54:51.440
Let's move on to our next story from Dark Sakura.

54:53.120 --> 54:57.440
So, um, wow, Konami, and this doesn't have anything to do with Pachi slot.

54:58.440 --> 54:58.800
Uh,

54:58.800 --> 55:03.800
Konami is really working on a game developing comeback and they announced,

55:05.280 --> 55:08.960
um, that their Osaka studio is now open.

55:09.240 --> 55:12.640
It is a development focused studio with, uh,

55:13.120 --> 55:17.800
the best brand newest equipment to build new games for, uh,

55:17.840 --> 55:22.280
the current, uh, consoles and those on their way. Um,

55:23.360 --> 55:24.440
they said, uh,

55:25.440 --> 55:29.520
that they're opening the Konami's group, uh, next generation, uh,

55:29.560 --> 55:34.160
R and D in 2025. And that, uh,

55:34.640 --> 55:38.080
you know, they should be done with outsourcing, you know,

55:38.080 --> 55:40.040
like they're doing with Silent Hill right now.

55:40.640 --> 55:44.760
And they are going to actually, my apologies.

55:44.760 --> 55:49.200
They say they are still going to be doing some outsourcing like they are with,

55:49.240 --> 55:52.600
uh, Silent Hill. Um, but,

55:52.680 --> 55:54.160
and this is the quote, uh,

55:54.160 --> 55:59.160
the Konami Osaka studio is a developmental relocation of the existing studio and

56:00.800 --> 56:05.760
comes with the concept of creators first. Um,

56:06.240 --> 56:11.240
so they want to have the best environment for development where their creators

56:12.400 --> 56:14.840
can reach their full potential.

56:16.880 --> 56:20.920
They're going to be over 9,000, but their,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.520
their R and D, um, center, like I said,

56:23.520 --> 56:28.520
is going to be done by 2025 and it's called Konami creative front Tokyo Bay.

56:29.600 --> 56:34.120
And it is, uh, in construction at Ariake, uh, Kotaku.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.400
So there you go.

56:37.280 --> 56:40.240
I have to admit I'm, I'm skeptical. You know,

56:40.280 --> 56:42.560
Konami hasn't done a lot of great stuff for me,

56:42.560 --> 56:44.000
especially in the home entertainment space.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.400
I realized the arcade divisions been kicking, you know,

56:46.400 --> 56:48.480
and doing good stuff for a while now.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.880
Obviously I have reasons to distrust Konami in this space,

56:51.880 --> 56:55.560
but I'm also willing to look at it and go, look,

56:55.600 --> 56:58.960
this has been going on for years and maybe Konami is realizing they have to do

56:58.960 --> 57:03.640
something different. And if this is a start of something different and maybe,

57:03.640 --> 57:08.240
you know, this is not just a new office, but a newly managed office, a newly,

57:08.600 --> 57:13.120
you know, and it's a sign of a future thing, then I remain open to it.

57:13.400 --> 57:15.680
Let's see what they put out there. Um,

57:15.840 --> 57:19.320
I know we've got that Suikoden remake that's coming out that, you know,

57:19.320 --> 57:21.760
people are very excited about. Um,

57:22.160 --> 57:24.160
I don't think that one is actually outsourced.

57:24.160 --> 57:27.880
I think that is an in-house thing they're doing. I could be wrong on that. Uh,

57:27.920 --> 57:30.760
but you know, it could be, it could be the start.

57:30.960 --> 57:34.880
There's been rumors for a while about Castlevania coming back in some form or

57:34.880 --> 57:38.600
another. So, uh, it could be very interesting to see what the studio brings us,

57:38.600 --> 57:42.800
but I, you can understand if I'm a little bit cautiously, I have huge,

57:42.960 --> 57:47.560
like I, I need to see the, the facts to get me really excited on this stuff.

57:47.560 --> 57:51.960
Right. So, yeah, I'm with SHO 100 Matt in chat.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.320
I'm open-minded, but I'm careful in getting my hopes up.

57:56.200 --> 57:59.480
It's a very good way of putting it. All right, let's move on. Loki.

58:00.640 --> 58:01.160
All right.

58:01.160 --> 58:05.640
So let's talk a little bit more about how Nintendo is cracking down on things.

58:05.640 --> 58:07.680
And so now they're coming after.

58:07.680 --> 58:09.320
It's not just Microsoft this week.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.960
It's not just Microsoft. Um, no,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.360
they're are coming after point crow,

58:14.360 --> 58:19.040
who is a YouTuber who also developed a mod for breath of the

58:19.040 --> 58:21.720
wild, but allows you to play it in multiplayer.

58:21.720 --> 58:25.200
I'm familiar with point crow because he tends to team up with Doug, Doug,

58:25.200 --> 58:29.640
and I watched Doug, Doug religiously. Um, and I have watched them play.

58:29.640 --> 58:32.240
It sounds like an awesome mod. It is pretty cool.

58:32.240 --> 58:35.160
They do like different challenges and stuff like that using it.

58:35.200 --> 58:36.880
And it's just kind of a lot of fun. Well,

58:36.880 --> 58:40.080
of course Nintendo has been taking down, um,

58:40.160 --> 58:44.280
or demonetizing his videos that feature that mod,

58:44.920 --> 58:49.560
basically copyright claiming them. And, um, you know,

58:50.440 --> 58:54.760
that's kind of annoying, but also I guess kind of expected, um,

58:54.760 --> 58:56.960
according to point grow, he posts on Twitter,

58:56.960 --> 59:00.080
incredibly disappointed in 10 of America has decided to block my videos and

59:00.080 --> 59:00.920
breath of the wild.

59:01.160 --> 59:04.880
It's the love for the community and innovation that we bring that has kept it

59:04.880 --> 59:08.480
alive and brought new people to love the Zelda series.

59:08.640 --> 59:12.240
I hope you reverse your decision. Uh, they won't. Um,

59:13.360 --> 59:15.000
and then of course they go along with that though.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.400
He also did release the mod to the public. Um,

59:18.440 --> 59:21.200
I think that actually was before they took that stuff down.

59:21.480 --> 59:25.400
Might have been why they took that stuff or, uh, tried to copyright claim it,

59:25.400 --> 59:27.160
but, um,

59:27.840 --> 59:30.560
too late once on the internet, always on the internet.

59:30.920 --> 59:34.360
Yep. So, so, well, that's, I mean,

59:35.360 --> 59:36.160
I don't know what to think,

59:36.160 --> 59:39.640
because obviously Nintendo is notorious about protecting its IPS,

59:39.640 --> 59:44.120
especially when you start to do these types of things. Right. Um, and I, you know,

59:44.120 --> 59:47.800
there's a new Zelda game on the horizon and I know it doesn't have multiplayer

59:48.320 --> 59:53.400
out the gate anyway, but who's to say if there's one thing, you know,

59:53.560 --> 59:57.080
I know y'all have been joking in chat and I've been joking myself about making a

59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.640
lot of predictions that came true this year. Right. But here's what,

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.120
here's what anyone can predict.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.720
There's going to be DLC for the new Zelda game. Here's the game,

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.560
but there will be DLC at some point for that.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.240
Who's to say the multiplayer wouldn't be maybe one of the,

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.120
it won't be because they don't know that the internet exists.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.400
So therefore it won't be like, I know we joke about Nintendo,

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.400
like being well behind the times when it comes to technology, but yeah,

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.720
I just don't think that they're going to put effort into develop multiplayer in

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.400
this game. I don't think one that their engine can run it. Um,

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.800
cause this is being done through emulation and on a PC.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:37.840
Oh, that's the no, no part. That's the no, no part. So that,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.400
that's how they're able to do a lot of these mods. I mean, that's just any mod.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.920
It's really through emulation and modding, um, the ISO and stuff like that.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.680
So I just don't think that they're going to be able to pull that off with just

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.120
the Nintendo switch hardware, maybe on another system. Yeah. But like right now,

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.840
they're just not going to do it. I just don't see it happening.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.440
I did not realize it was just like a modded switch thing. It was actually a PC.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.000
Uh, that's why they don't,

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.200
they don't want people knowing you can play it on your PC.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.760
They still sell copies of breath of the wild full price, by the way.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.840
There's still like, yeah, and there's still like things I've, I watch. Um,

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.160
one of the things I watched Doug Doug do a lot is, uh,

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.200
the breath of the wild randomizers were randomize and stuff.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:24.000
So that's kind of neat, but yeah, it's just a lot of that stuff.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.520
Obviously in any randomizer that you see on the internet nowadays,

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.520
for any game it's just done through emulation. And so, yeah, I mean,

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:37.000
I mean, I don't think it's really hurting anything honestly, but like,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.200
I get it. Like if you want to like take down something like take down,

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.320
like cease and desist the mod or something like that,

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.960
but like copyright claiming a video and that just seems weird,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.520
especially when it's like, we'll copyright claim a video that's using the mod,

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.560
but we won't copyright claim a video that just features the game.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.160
It's just, it's, it's a way to, it's a, I mean,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.600
yes it's well within the right to do that cause they own some of the content,

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:06.360
but it's also just a way to abuse that content system to stop people from not

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.640
seeing things that you don't want them to see is really what it comes down to.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.360
So it's like, it's a legal gray area, but I mean,

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.800
they're, they're abusing their powers.

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:18.920
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf points out some randomizers will spit out a ROM image and

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.040
you can play it on original hardware. Yeah. There's a lot of, um, like, you know,

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.160
the eight bit randomizers or even 16 bit. Uh, yeah,

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.200
I spit out a new ROM image.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.920
I know I was fucking around with like Zelda randomizers, Metroid.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.520
There's actually that really cool Zelda and Metroid randomizer.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.280
I really liked that one where like you go into a dungeon and it spits you out

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:40.400
Metroid somewhere. It's pretty cool. So, um, let's see.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.240
Marissa in chat says, uh,

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.600
my boyfriend said we'll get Tears of the Kingdom when it's on sale over

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.040
Christmas. And I laughed and laughed. He doesn't know.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.720
I would say your best bet with that, if you,

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.600
I don't even know if these are available anymore.

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.040
Somebody will have to let me know. But Nintendo had that whole, um,

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.880
two game ticket that you buy a ticket for like a hundred dollars and you can get

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.320
two games with it. That will be your best chance to get that game.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.760
I think $20 off. Cause they're selling that for 70 now. Right?

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.880
So that ticket will let you have it for 50 essentially,

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.720
but you have to have another game that you also want to get on sale.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.740
So it's like the, it's the Costco deal. You get a discount,

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:21.580
but you've got to buy a bulk and that's about the closest thing probably to

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.460
that right now. If that's even still available, I'm not sure it is.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.020
Somebody in chat will have to, uh, uh, verify with me.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.580
Cause I know it was a couple of months ago they were offering that. So, um,

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.420
all right, let's move on. And I want to talk about, Ooh, Sony.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:39.420
We've talked about Microsoft in the news, Nintendo and legal news. How about so,

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:39.780
let's,

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.860
let's go for the tic-tac-toe and talk about Sony in legal news this week.

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.300
Sony is mad.

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.940
Sony was kicking and screaming, uh,

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:53.820
against UK regulators about their surprising unprecedented and

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:57.940
irrational decision, uh, on this,

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:01.180
this week about allowing basically the Microsoft Activision merger to go

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:06.220
through. Um, some of the things that Sony said, uh, in the,

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.300
uh, their retort, uh,

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:14.060
the provisional findings assessed a significant body of evidence in the round to

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.940
support its finding that Microsoft would have the ability and incentive to

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.460
withhold Activision content.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.500
And that this would substantially lessen competition by foreclosing

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.180
PlayStation. In assessing this body of evidence,

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:29.060
the PFs emphasize consistent with a jury jurisprudence on the

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:33.580
CMA's duty to assess evidence that it is particularly important in this case to

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.460
assess the merged entities incentive to foreclose by considering all the

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:41.660
available evidence in the round, rather than focus on a single model, uh,

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:44.940
or referring to the actual findings.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.060
It gets into a lot of this legal language and so forth,

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:53.300
but essentially they're pissed off because they think that Microsoft could

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.620
still release versions that have different quality,

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.980
including versions that have technical issues and so forth. Uh,

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.500
Sony saying in an infamous quote, they hit social media.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.700
Sony said call of duty gamers are passionate,

01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:10.260
knowledgeable and sophisticated. Just like you hear on voice chat, right?

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.900
Why would you go through that?

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:17.300
Why would you purposely release a buggy game on a certain call?

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.380
That doesn't make any, any sense whatsoever why you would do that.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.060
Why would you spend the time? Hey, let's purposely break this game. Yes.

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.620
Could they release a copy that has like, I don't know,

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:32.220
like an additional bull, additional playable character or something like that.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.460
Spiderman. Could they do that? Maybe.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:40.500
But I think that the only reason Sony would think that is because of projection

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:42.220
because they've done it themselves,

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.700
but like to actually intently make a game that's broken, like,

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.980
I mean, this is stupid.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:51.340
Uh,

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:55.180
SD200 Matt says Sony is grasping at straws. They, they are,

01:05:55.220 --> 01:06:00.020
but I also understand a little bit why, um,

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.780
they're grasping at straws. I mean, yeah, this is, I, I,

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:07.620
I don't think this goes well for Sony, but at the same time, you know,

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.700
I don't think this like ruins Sony or anything. It's just,

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.460
it's just another chess piece mover in this game because you know what?

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:18.100
Then Sony ends up buying Square Enix and we still won't get the pixel remasters

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:18.940
on Xbox.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:23.140
I don't think they would go that far to even do the parody thing that Microsoft's

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.500
trying to do with this. So I, I just,

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.460
I don't see this bringing Sony to its knees,

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:32.860
but is it going to impact their business? Sure. But them's the break Sony.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.260
I think Sony's got a bigger problem with what they're looking at with, with,

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.220
for some reason,

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:43.060
the U S Congress people wanting to write notes about the their issues in

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:45.100
Japan. But I mean,

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.900
some of it, they're kind of right though.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:53.580
Like Sony has a choke hold on the Japanese market with Nintendo,

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:55.500
but when it comes to the high end gaming,

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.220
the roles are reversed.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:01.180
They would not make a commitment to put those games on. They will not be like,

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.100
why would we, why are we purchasing the company if we're in, you know,

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:08.540
share the assets with them? No, they don't. Where's God of war.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:13.740
Where's any of those games could be on Xbox. They're not, except,

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:16.460
I'm sorry, except MLB, the show. But that, that,

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:21.220
that is like legally required to be there from their agreement with MLB.

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.540
So that's the one game.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.060
I will say it is interesting playing Minecraft dungeons on the PlayStation five

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.820
and seeing the Xbox logo come up. It's it,

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:33.340
there is something so weird about it. I will say.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.140
I mean, it's just, it's, it's just really weird though. Like in this day,

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:42.220
like they said, like, listen, we've got, we've committed to 10 years. I mean,

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:47.260
yeah, like 10 years time, like time to come up with your own shooter,

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.420
then like obviously, yeah.

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.140
In 10 years, video games are going to look different.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.140
We will have the holodeck in 10 years.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.220
The holiday will be here in 10 years.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:59.020
Probably not, but like, it'll still be like, it'll still be better,

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.620
but like at the same time. Yeah. It's just, I just,

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:06.180
that is just the all of you out there asking when this show will end when the

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:10.180
holodeck is released, the show's over because that's, that's it folks.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:15.060
We we've set in the very beginning gaming is always one step closer to the

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:18.540
holodeck. When we get the holodeck, that's it. No LR.

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:23.540
It's done because we, we hit the end folks that no more hot takes.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.380
We did it.

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.380
What do you say we end when the holodeck comes out? Sounds good.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:35.380
Actually, no, what we'll do.

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:39.100
Someone's going to release a VR headset called the holodeck and we're like,

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:39.940
dang it.

01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:41.380
O-L-R in the holodeck.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.180
All right. Anyway, moving on.

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.060
Bonds double 06 says, but Rob,

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:50.020
you could be right in my bedroom every Sunday with the halo deck.

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.700
I wish I could say you're the first listener to invite me to your bedroom.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:01.700
Just kidding. Just kidding. All right. Moving on.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.700
Let's go to

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.540
the halo deck.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.180
Or am I? Moving on.

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:12.260
Let's go to our next story.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.580
Dark Sakura quickly changed the topic.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:19.540
So going back to the earlier topic of the Mario movie,

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:24.340
there are, of course, going to be specialty soundtracks released.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:29.420
You can get a two LP exclusive

01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:32.660
with with various colors.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:36.260
There is a pink and yellow and a green and red.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.780
You can get a seven inch that just says Bowser on it.

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:42.900
There's a CD and a cassette.

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.620
Yes, you can get the the Super Mario

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.860
Brothers movie soundtrack on cassette for 20 bucks.

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:53.420
That's rad cassette.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.380
I would only be even more like.

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:03.660
I don't know feeling about it if they said eight track.

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.980
But because I find the cassette thing, if that makes sense, because,

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.700
yeah, I find the cassette thing ironic because when I was a kid,

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:17.820
I had the Game Boy and I had my little cord from Radio Shack

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:23.140
that allowed me to plug that in from the Game Boy out to the mic in in my

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.420
tape deck or whatever.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:28.500
And I actually make cassette tapes of Game Boy soundtracks.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:32.300
Basically, I would play and let the music play in the background. So

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.740
the cassette will include.

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:37.380
And by the way, it is an I am a bit exclusive.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.380
The cassette will either be red or green.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.700
Randomly has music from the movie.

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.780
It has a song Peaches by Jack Black as Bowser

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:54.060
movie score, some themes by Koji Kondo, and it's shipping Q3 2023.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:58.020
I I guess I shouldn't ask because this is probably a spoiler, but I'm going to.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.820
Is that is that the president of the United States of America song from like the 90s?

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.260
Peaches? No, millions of Peaches.

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:10.340
Peaches for me, because I when I heard that Bowser sang a song called Peaches,

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:14.060
I was like, that would actually be really funny if that was something he was singing

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.860
about the princess, millions of Peaches, Peaches for free.

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:23.700
That song ruled whatever, whatever happened to Pusa.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.780
Whatever happened to them, are they still around?

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:30.540
Did they just fade into obscurity like a lot of 90s bands?

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:32.860
That's sad. All right, anyway.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:34.660
But what was the other?

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.660
There was another big song.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.260
The duh duh duh duh duh duh is in my head.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:41.860
That's it. That's it.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:44.380
Yeah, I said, because I instantly went to the weird, weird.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.140
I mean, that is the more recognizable version.

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:50.940
Yes. Oh, God.

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.100
That was all right.

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:57.700
Anyway, Zen Monkey 11 says, I thought they were called the dead presidents.

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.500
No, there's a dead Kennedys, but that's a very different band.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.220
All right. Moving on.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:08.820
The dead presidents was the the robbery gang from Point Break.

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.380
Oh, wow. That's that's a deep cut.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.580
I love it. All right.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.860
You wouldn't know how many times I saw that movie?

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.700
I'm going to say a lot.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:23.500
Because I was a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and I watched it just to see Flea.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.460
I love that. Yeah.

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.380
Oh, my God. Fleas, Fleas probably is.

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:31.460
The Kennedys were both in it, and

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:33.220
the character shot himself in the foot.

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.260
That's what I remember.

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:36.700
Is Fleas in his 60s now, right?

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.500
Gotta be. I think so.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.900
He was also in My Own Private Idaho.

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.340
Does he still play on stage in just his tighty whities

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.860
or did he finally leave that era behind?

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.460
Yes. And you know, Point Break started Kiana Reeves,

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:55.100
who was in John Wick number four, which was in theaters,

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.100
which I went and saw a movie in the theater.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:03.060
Then they had a trailer for, you know, those classic theater,

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:05.100
you know, the classic movies that they play,

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.100
which had Footloose starring Kevin Bacon.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:13.220
I was just about to ask, how does this tie to Kevin Bacon?

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:16.060
And you did it. You did it.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.780
Also, did you know that Flea plays trumpet?

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:21.420
No, I didn't.

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:25.180
But I mean, I am not surprised at all that a lot of these like rockers

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:28.780
and I can't believe I'm about to call Red Hot Chili Peppers classic rock,

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.260
but maybe a little bit.

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:33.420
A lot of these classic rockers are actually like classically trained,

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.980
like a lot of them are like are like deeply musically trained

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.300
more than you would think.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:44.380
So the lead singer of Queensryche was actually an operatic trained baritone.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.700
Yeah. Oh, for sure.

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.060
So anyway, voice. Oh, my God.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.340
So good. Let's move on.

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.580
Let's move on to the next story.

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:54.820
Nintendo issues. How about it, Loki?

01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:59.820
Yes. So it's apparently Nintendo is now expanding

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.540
their Joy-Con repair system for the UK and Europe.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:08.420
They made the statement saying Nintendo takes a great pride

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.820
in creating high quality and durable products

01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.940
and is continuously making improvements to them, therefore.

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:17.780
And until further notice, Nintendo offers to consumers

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:22.220
who purchase their respective products in EEA, UK and Switzerland

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:28.140
that repairs for responsiveness syndrome relating to control six drift

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:31.420
will be conducted by Nintendo

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.180
at no official Nintendo centers at no charge.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.900
The reason for this is actually because of

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:44.900
I believe the European Commission

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:49.300
who was asking them about their faulty stuff.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:53.300
And this statement from the European Commission is full of cringe.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.820
So just cringe warning.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:01.580
Let's go. We've got news that's even better than finding a hidden one up mushroom.

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.540
We've recently contacted Nintendo to address the reoccurring

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.860
technical problems with defective switch controllers,

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.660
and we're happy to report that they've agreed to offer consumer

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:16.620
or all consumers the right to repair free of charge, even beyond legal guarantee.

01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:19.300
This will prevent the disposal of unrepaired controllers

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.460
and unnecessary waste.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.460
So don't wait.

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.780
Jump into action and get your controllers repaired for free.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.580
Stop with the cringe thing.

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.500
It's your government entity enough.

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.460
Enough. It's bad.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:35.580
It makes you look like hello, fellow kids, like just don't.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.220
Thank you for the trigger warning on that.

01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.660
I really wish I could have muted you.

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.820
That was that was terrible.

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:46.580
It's so bad. It's like it's just it's just awful.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.620
Oh, all right.

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:52.660
Hey, at least you get to fix your your faulty controllers.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.300
Why is this still why is this still an issue?

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.940
It's a great question, and this should really be here to you.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.460
This should be a thing here, too, honestly.

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:07.180
All right, because like they yes, we understand that this happens a lot.

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:09.300
But where are we doing anything about it?

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.540
No, no, we're not doing anything about it.

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.660
All right. Well, let's talk about something

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.860
Nintendo won't repair, and that's your cell phone.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.380
And honestly, they may not be making many games for it either.

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:24.100
It's it's hard to tell based on this statement.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.220
But Miyamoto was doing an interview with Variety.

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.580
You know, again, this is a big Hollywood thing.

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:33.620
And Miyamoto said that mobile apps will not be the primary path

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.540
of future Mario games.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.260
Probably not a huge surprise based on the performance of Dr.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.100
Mario World, which was pulled, Super Mario Run,

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.940
which didn't quite live up to expectations.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.540
I know it has its fans, but, you know, it didn't quite live up

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:46.780
to expectations.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:48.980
They're saying that the strategy going forward is a, quote,

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.860
hardware and software integrated gaming experience.

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:53.420
What went wrong?

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:58.140
Well, in the interview, Miyamoto basically blames control intuitiveness,

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:01.260
something a lot of us were saying a long time ago.

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.820
Could have told you that before you even put the game out.

01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.420
The quote here, when we explore the opportunity of making Mario

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:12.060
games for the mobile phone, which is a more common generic device,

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:15.260
it was challenging to determine what that game should be.

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.300
That is why I played the role of director for Super Mario Run

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.380
to be able to translate that Nintendo hardware experience

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.340
to the smart devices.

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:27.780
Very interesting little quote, because you really see Nintendo's philosophy

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:31.260
in there about how they make games for their hardware,

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:35.180
and they're going to show off their their hardware twist

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:36.980
or whatever in the games that they make.

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:37.740
That's for sure.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:41.020
It's a very interesting sort of thing in that statement.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:44.060
But, you know, also, we know this about Nintendo, right?

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:46.980
So obviously, a cell phone was not something they designed

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:50.700
and probably not something they particularly cared for

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:53.180
in making some of these games, because, you know, like we said,

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:57.180
you know, I'm not here to knock all cell phone games as bad.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:59.700
They're not. I enjoy and play plenty of them.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:02.980
But they're all designed with the limitations

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:05.420
and structure of a cell phone in mind.

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:06.820
I don't see it as much anymore.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:09.420
I feel like we're past that point where we're trying to shoehorn

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.060
ports of old games into mobile phone.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.900
I feel like that era kind of came and went and good riddance, quite frankly,

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:18.060
because I don't think any of those games are fun.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:22.340
But things that are fun are things like, you know, Pokemon Go.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:25.180
Recent controversy aside, I'm not stepping in that.

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:28.620
But generally, that game was designed for a mobile phone.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.500
And a lot of the things about it is good.

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:33.660
Dark Sakura's word game. Sure, it's great.

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.380
It's designed for a mobile phone, you know,

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:40.100
or say like a Words with Friends type of thing designed for that.

01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.860
You know, it's designed for that experience.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:45.460
And that's why those games work out well.

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.860
Miyamoto did not comment

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.220
on any of Nintendo's other mobile properties.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:55.420
Things like Animal Crossing, Pocket Camp and Fire Emblem Heroes,

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:58.740
which, by the way, is the top earning mobile game for Nintendo.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:02.140
It crossed the one billion mark in June of last year.

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:04.260
So that's that.

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:06.900
Also in that interview, Miyamoto did not mention

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:10.220
when a new Mario game would arrive, and that did remind me like

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.020
very surprised

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:16.220
Nintendo did not put out a new Mario game to go with this movie.

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.940
Now, we saw the holiday coming up and Nintendo could announce something

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.860
in the June season or whatever for the holidays,

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:28.100
even if they repackage old shit, which Nintendo is not afraid to do.

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:33.780
I'm really surprised Nintendo doesn't have something ready to go

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.580
like now for this movie being out.

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.900
Yeah, they did.

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:41.220
Well, they don't because they've had opportunities

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.140
and a whole director, you know, towards the movie. Sure.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:49.420
I hear rumors are supposed to be directed this week, but about Zelda.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.460
So that'd be interesting. Yeah.

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:55.260
Yeah, I don't think they have a game coming anytime soon.

01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.860
Looney Barn and Chat says, isn't Mario Odyssey still fairly new?

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:01.180
Oh, not at this point.

01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:03.780
I'm afraid it's it was a pre pandemic.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.940
It was a pre pandemic game to put it in perspective.

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.980
Fine. The next game, the next Mario game is probably for their new console anyway.

01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:11.780
So it's probably being saved for that. Maybe.

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:14.780
I was surprised they never did a Luigi's Odyssey or a sequel to

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:18.060
Mario Odyssey in some capacity. I was really surprised.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.940
Pod Culture says they will announce it in time for the video release.

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:26.700
Then that that that window is not what it used to be.

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:30.860
Pod Culture just making sure you know what that that means in the next six weeks,

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.860
because that Mario movie will be I think they've already said

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:37.140
it's the first week of June for on demand, isn't it?

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:40.100
Yeah. Like Ant-Man Quantumania is coming out pretty soon.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:41.140
Like the window.

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:46.500
It used to be like six months to a year is now like three months, maybe. Yeah.

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:50.300
DJ Rama S and Chat says, as much as I love the Mario movie,

01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:52.380
there really isn't the need for a video game tie in.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:56.140
I get that. Obviously, the box office proves that I get I get that,

01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:01.660
you know, but I'm just I'm surprised Nintendo isn't riding that wave.

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:07.340
With I would love a Mario game like an open world Mario game

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:11.500
in the vein of like a Breath of the Wild or something like that would be amazing.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.540
I think they could do something like this.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:18.500
Odyssey was kind of close, not totally, but it was more open world,

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:23.380
you know, a little more that Mario 64 aesthetic. But yeah, I loved Odyssey.

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:26.140
I loved it. I would love to see another one of those games.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.260
And I was good.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:30.220
There were those rumors sometimes ago about a Super Luigi's Odyssey.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:34.140
And I'm here for that. Like, I really wish that was true, but we'll see.

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.860
So, yeah. All right.

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:40.420
Well, we'll have to go back to a simple time for now, though,

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:42.940
in our next segment. So let's get to it.

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.300
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.740
or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:03.860
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:06.460
And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:10.940
I picked Stryker's 1945.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:17.660
It was also known as Stryker 1945, but everywhere else it was Stryker's,

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.900
plural. It is a vertical

01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:23.820
scrolling shooter.

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:28.740
It was developed by Saikyo in 1995.

01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:34.340
In Japan, it came out on PlayStation and Sega Saturn by Atlas in 1996

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:38.860
and also released as part of the Saikyo Shooting Collection.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:44.820
Volume one Stryker's 1945 1 and 2 by Taito for PlayStation 2.

01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:50.300
In Europe, it came out under Playit as 1945 1 and 2, the arcade games.

01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:54.620
There was the sequel Stryker's 1945 in 1997

01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:58.860
that in North America just came out as Stryker's 1945.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:03.540
And then Stryker's 1945 3 in 1999, which was

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:08.620
and there was a second title remake called Stryker's 1945 Plus.

01:23:09.220 --> 01:23:13.660
So also more recently in 2022,

01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:17.500
the original arcade version was included in the Sega Astro City mini

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:21.660
So there you go.

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:28.460
Anyway, you play as one of several planes

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:31.300
and each of them has three attacks.

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.620
There's a normal shot, a charged shot and a bomb.

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.540
It clears out the enemy and the bullets.

01:23:36.540 --> 01:23:39.900
Normal and charged shots can be strengthened by different power ups

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.740
and gold bombs.

01:23:41.740 --> 01:23:45.340
You can get gold bars for bonus points.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:49.460
And when you defeat the final boss, your time, the number of gold bars,

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.740
the number of enemies killed are added up for each level.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.700
And if it's high enough, you get a silver or gold medal.

01:23:55.140 --> 01:24:00.340
In the Japanese arcade version, there is a hidden post credit bonus

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:04.980
that can be unlocked if you beat the entire game without losing a life.

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:08.740
And it shows all six of the pilots,

01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:13.940
which are five women and one man posing undressed.

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:17.260
Go Fig.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:22.300
But anyway, it's set in the summer of 1945 after World War Two.

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:28.060
The world is in that sort of post-war piece.

01:24:28.580 --> 01:24:32.620
And then an organization called CANNY, C-A-N-Y,

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.940
wants to take over the world with super weapons.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:42.660
And so. The the I guess it's the United Military

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:47.260
is sending out people to go stop the bad guys.

01:24:48.420 --> 01:24:52.420
So, yeah, I mean, fairly simple, as you can see on the screen,

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:57.140
those who are watching on Twitch, it's it's a shooter game.

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:00.940
You play a plane, but it's it's still considered

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:05.700
to be one of the most successful shooter games.

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:10.540
In fact, in Japan, as of Game Machine's

01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:14.820
July 15th 1995 issue, it was considered the fourth most successful

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.820
arcade game of the month.

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:19.540
The Saturn version was highly lauded

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.860
as a 92 out of 100 for its review.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.060
So there we go.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.100
Picked a quick one.

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:31.820
If you want to know who was behind it, first of all.

01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:37.500
The director of the game was Yorichika Naozumi.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:43.500
It was developed by, like I said, by Psycho.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.820
There also is an iOS Android version by KMBox

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:50.020
and a window version by City Connection.

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:53.980
And I'll tell you what made me think of this is when I was going to pick up

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:56.700
Osmond is that I saw they had two

01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:00.660
Psycho collections coming up for Switch are already out.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.300
And so I thought, why not?

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.420
It's a fun one.

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.900
It's a really great game and it's a two player game.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:10.740
But it was released on Psycho's first generation arcade system.

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.980
Now, before we wrap up, because I and I apologize,

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.780
I stepped out to do a bio break, as I usually do right about now.

01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:23.460
But I don't think this has no relation to Capcom's 1940 X series, right?

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:27.180
No, this is a completely different company.

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:30.300
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was it's interesting to me because

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.820
it has that like element, obviously, if they're both World War Two games.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:37.220
Right. But I definitely get that whole like, oh, this feels like a

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:41.100
maybe the word would be spiritual successor by fans or something.

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.420
You know, I don't know what else to call it.

01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:47.940
Don't. When did 19 1943 come out?

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:51.380
Oh, the first game was like 1984 is very old.

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:56.660
This this is I'm not even going to call it.

01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:01.540
Yeah, actually, Orange Wright just just nailed it similar to Aero Fighters.

01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:07.700
OK, the but I mean, it's easy to look at a playing game

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:12.020
set in the 40s and say that it's related.

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:18.820
I actually think that this game, it's a pretty fun shooter.

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:21.060
Of course, I'm no good at it because I suck at shooters,

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:24.940
but it has a lot of challenge and, you know,

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.820
some pretty good music in it.

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:30.060
And it's just a really tight game.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:33.660
I mean, I have played an original of it.

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.140
And is the arcade version just so clean?

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.260
Of course, if you want the best at home version, you get it on Saturn.

01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:42.380
All right. There it is.

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:45.500
Your classic game of the week, Strikers, 1945.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.900
Admittedly, not one I was super familiar with.

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:50.100
So I learned something.

01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:54.620
I always thought, though, that the company's psycho, that their name was so funny.

01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.820
Because not necessarily spelled that way.

01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:01.580
There's this P S I K Y O, but the word psycho means the greatest.

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:05.260
So, yeah. All right.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:10.420
Well, we were going to get into some more rapid fire news,

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:12.260
but it looks like Loki stepped away for a minute.

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.420
So I guess I got to buy some time.

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:18.100
That's OK. You know, I'll get mine out of the way.

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:19.860
Usually that segment goes a little longer.

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.980
Sure. We'll start with Dark Sakura.

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:23.580
We'll get into some rapid fire news special.

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:24.900
We'll start with you. Sure.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:28.180
All right. Well, you know, we were all up in arms

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:31.220
about trying to get the eShop stuff done.

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.660
But Pokemon Stadium being one of the first Pokemon spinoff games

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:39.660
is actually coming to Switch owners via the Switch online

01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:44.620
plus expansion pack subscription service starting on April 12th,

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:48.020
which is this upcoming Friday.

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:52.620
And it will be accessible via the Nintendo 64 app

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:55.700
with, you know, if you've got the subscription,

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.980
all you have to do is update the app next week and you can pick it up.

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.580
Nice. All right.

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:08.420
I yeah, I might have to I still not am not on the extended

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:12.980
Nintendo thing with expansion pack, whatever it's called, but Pokemon Stadium.

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.460
That's one that's tempting to get it for. All right.

01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.300
Loki, let's go to your rapid fire news stories now that you're settled back in.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:24.940
Yeah. So the murder of Sonic had a murder of Sonic,

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:28.020
the hedgehog game that came out last week for April Fools

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:30.860
has actually surpassed one million downloads.

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:35.540
It's one of the highest rated Sonic games on Steam right now.

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:41.100
And the number 61 highest rated game on Steam of all time.

01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:44.700
Pretty unexpected, I think.

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:48.700
So really unexpected happens all the time.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:52.300
I mean, it's how we got how to full boyfriend.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.420
I mean, I don't think Sega expected that it would be this popular,

01:29:55.420 --> 01:29:57.500
but yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:03.180
And then the Final Fantasy pixel remaster PlayStation four and switch.

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.900
They have a release date of April 19th

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:10.260
and they will include my birthday.

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:15.420
Yes. And they will include a new font setting as well.

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:22.300
New fonts. And I think there was an intro credits or something like that.

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:28.220
All right. Well, I got one more story for you,

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:32.100
and it has to do with Overwatch or specifically Overwatch two.

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.220
I'm not sure how many of you are playing Overwatch two,

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:38.660
but we have the announcement of a new hero for Overwatch two, who is Life Weaver,

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:42.260
a Thai scientist who has long hair

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:45.300
and a sense of style, confidence and bravado.

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:47.780
And you see him in the trailer.

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:51.020
He uses plant themed powers to restore health.

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:53.780
And also, I guess he can like lift people up with a flower petal.

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.300
It's kind of like a thing that he uses as well.

01:30:56.660 --> 01:31:01.220
Also important to point out, Life Weaver is in the game's lore pansexual.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:05.700
So as the first pan character, I guess openly pan character in the game,

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:11.020
although I swear some voice interactions from chatting was was farmed with Batiste

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.940
and it sounded like the two of them were flirting in the little

01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.660
dialogue that was going back and forth.

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:20.220
So, you know, that's cool.

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:24.740
I mean, I guess my point is, is that like if you're really upset about gay beer,

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:28.220
then wait until I tell you that in Overwatch, everybody is gay.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:29.940
And that's a fact.

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:34.420
All right. But check out Life Weaver coming out soon to the game.

01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.100
Actually, it does look like a cool mechanic.

01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:40.060
I wish I was better at Overwatch two, but I'm not.

01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:43.420
All right. Let's travel around the world.

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:46.460
I still refuse to touch anything from Activision

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.900
until after the merger goes through. Yeah.

01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:52.700
I can't because Diablo, but also

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.820
just, well, and I think I've talked about this before,

01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:58.060
hearing from some people that are on the inside.

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:01.340
I've heard about some of the tangible changes that are happening.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.860
So it's nice to see that they are making changes.

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.500
But yes, I am a matter of principle because of a certain somebody.

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:10.020
Sure, I understand.

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:13.420
All right. Well, moving on, let's travel around the world

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:16.060
and check out some stuff that's coming out a little sooner.

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.860
World release dates.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:20.180
Loki, we'll start with you in the U.S. and what's coming out here.

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:25.180

Legacy Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:04.780
All right. Traveling to Japan, I seem to remember last week was pretty

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:07.700
and there wasn't a lot, but this week we have some releases again.

01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:11.460
So on the 13th, on the Nintendo Switch, we have Osmond coming in.

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.660
I think this is is this the one that you ordered, Dark Sakura?

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.260
Yes, it absolutely is.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.500
So, OK, so that's coming out in Japan this week.

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:22.100
There's a special there's a regular and a special edition.

01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:24.740
So I don't know if this is the special edition has like

01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:27.860
a really long poster and an art book and some stuff.

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:31.860
It's it's like it's like 60 bucks.

01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.940
And then the the standard one's like 30.

01:33:35.380 --> 01:33:37.540
It wasn't very expensive. Hmm.

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:40.660
I was just taking a peek here, showing folks what that might look like there.

01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:43.700
For those that are watching a twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:45.420
That's also out on PlayStation four.

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:48.500
I should point out as well as the switch, of course.

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.820
I ordered the Switch one.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.540
Yeah. All right.

01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:54.140
Some other games coming out this week on the Switch include

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:56.780
a Senju no Waltz for the Nintendo Switch.

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:58.820
There's a regular and a special edition for that.

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:03.700
There's also Castle of Shikigami 2 comes out this week from Konami.

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:08.620
Dokapon Kingdom Connect is out this week, as is Aiden Chronicle Rising

01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:11.660
is released over there as well this week.

01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:16.540
And Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is also out in Japan this week

01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:18.500
as it makes its way to the US as well.

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:20.060
That is everything on the switch.

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:23.900
But quickly, looking at the PlayStation five, we also have Atomic Heart

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:26.780
in regular and limited edition, making its way out

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:29.620
for the PlayStation five this week.

01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:32.140
And that's it.

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:34.820
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:39.420
Only two things on the list on the 13th for

01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:42.180
I guess this is computer.

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:46.020
It's X-Plane 12, but I have no idea what that is.

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:47.260
It's a flight simulator.

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:50.780
And then on the 14th for PlayStation Switch, we have Cult of the Lamb.

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:52.420
Oh, cool.

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.820
That's going to be my palate cleanser.

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:59.620
It's here in my my my subathon because I fucking love that game.

01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:01.380
It's so great.

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:04.060
All right. I have the soundtrack on vinyl.

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:05.940
Oh, fun. Yeah.

01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.260
And I'm supposed to be.

01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:10.140
I didn't I don't remember if I ordered the plushie.

01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.900
No, I didn't order the plushie, but I got the soundtrack.

01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:15.100
I need to get a record player. That would be fun.

01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:17.660
But then I'm like a record player to play all these damn records.

01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:20.220
I don't need another thing to spend more money on. All right.

01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:23.340
You can get a good one for not very expensive.

01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:25.940
I know. Then that opens the door to vinyl collection.

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:27.380
That's the problem.

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:31.540
I I've been collecting vinyl without having a record player, Rob.

01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:33.580
I have I have records already.

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:37.100
I know I have two, two records, two records, both of them.

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.900
And one of them I got you and the other one I bought in Seattle.

01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.900
Yep. The other one I bought in Seattle.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:48.420
I still wish that I had bought the Wendy Carlos album.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.260
The only reason I didn't buy it was because it had been published

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:52.980
under her dead name. Mm hmm.

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:55.100
But I still wish I had.

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.860
I would I would kill for a first printing of Switched on Bach.

01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:01.140
Yeah, I would. You should.

01:36:01.140 --> 01:36:04.220
I mean, not that you're going to be in Seattle anytime soon, but if you are,

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:07.420
there was an awesome record store at the Pike Market that I went to

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:09.700
that would probably have it, you know.

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.220
So if you're still interested in finding that, so.

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:17.340
There's a good place in Oakland that's near the the where the the park

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.940
where they have the farmer's market, I could go buy two.

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:22.940
But that's where I got

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:28.260
my my Xanadu soundtrack on vinyl.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.860
I actually do not know the name that that album would have been published under.

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:36.060
Don't. But same last name.

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.500
Yeah, OK. It would have been OK.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.980
So as long as I know the last name and the name of the album, I could find it.

01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:45.820
So if I'm ever in Seattle again, I may I may actually go to Seattle.

01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:47.740
There's a big Ingers thing up there in September,

01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:50.100
but it's literally the week after Dragon Con.

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:53.780
But I have enough, I've been on so many flights,

01:36:53.780 --> 01:36:57.300
I have enough frequent flyer points to like have a trip to Seattle.

01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:58.660
I might do it. We'll see.

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:00.100
Take me with you.

01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:02.740
Alan will be pissed if I go without him because we have friends up there.

01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:04.740
So I don't know. I don't know. We'll see.

01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:05.780
All right. All right.

01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:07.740
Well, I sent you the the the name.

01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.220
OK. All right. Moving on.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:14.340
Let's check out our next story here.

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.100
Loki. Yep.

01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:17.660
So we're starting to get news

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.860
of other non E3 events that are going to be happening.

01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:25.780
So Gamescom opening night live 2023 has been confirmed

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:31.420
by Jeff Keighley to be returning August 22nd.

01:37:31.940 --> 01:37:35.460
And of course, that's going to be taking place in

01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:39.060
Kondamesi, Germany.

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.860
He's busy. Yep, he's busy.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:44.180
So that'd be cool. I can't wait to see that.

01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:47.060
He has to replace E3 and open Gamescom.

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:49.300
That's that's busy. Does he sleep?

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.260
I don't know. No, he doesn't.

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:57.820
And then, of course, I sometimes I wonder all dozens of you,

01:37:57.820 --> 01:38:02.900
I'm sure excited to hear that the PC gaming show is coming back June 11th.

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:03.980
So that's right.

01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:08.060
We're going to be able to see some PC game titles, I guess

01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.580
hosted by Sean Plot.

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:15.940
Well, could I actually I have a wild theory.

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:20.500
Could the absence of E3 and some of these other pomp and circumstance

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:22.540
actually make this show better?

01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:26.420
No, because last year they didn't have E3 and it was not good.

01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:29.180
So I don't think so. Fair.

01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:33.260
Got shut me up. All right.

01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:35.340
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.620
Well, it is it is some sad news.

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:43.860
It was announced that American McGee's

01:38:44.900 --> 01:38:47.060
works at trying to make a third installment

01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:50.020
of the Alice series is quote at an end.

01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:55.140
There was a statement on on McGee's Patreon

01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.580
that said that he had, and this is the quote,

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.940
exhausted every option for getting a new Alice game made

01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:06.380
after EA reportedly decided to pass on the project

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:09.420
based on an internal analysis of the IP market

01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.220
market conditions and details of the production proposal.

01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:20.060
So he he's I mean, basically, they're like

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:23.780
they talked with EA about the efforts to get the new game

01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:29.220
and were presented with the design Bible and production plan.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:34.140
And it had the the schedule, the budget, the team, the design for everything.

01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:40.100
EA reviewed it and came back denying the licensing for Alice Asylum.

01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:43.980
So they are are passing it on.

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.820
Well, that's a bummer.

01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:50.780
Yeah, they have a really, really good series. Yeah.

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:55.260
I don't I feel like that can't be gone forever,

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.500
but it's going to be a while for sure. So.

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:03.580
All right. Moving on to news that is also frustrating.

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:07.100
Loki. Yes.

01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:11.820
So Monster Energy is a very litigious company

01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:13.900
and has a monster legal department.

01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:18.580
They attack anybody that uses the word monster,

01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:21.780
especially if they're defenseless indie developers.

01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.860
And so that's what they've done here.

01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:27.700
They have basically gone after glowstick entertainment's

01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:31.860
2020 game, Dark Deception, Monsters and Mortals,

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:34.260
because I know the first thing I hear

01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.580
or think of when I hear that is their energy drink, of course.

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:41.700
You mean they're nasty canopies?

01:40:41.700 --> 01:40:44.340
What are these? What are they going to do? Sue Halloween?

01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:44.940
Like, I don't.

01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:47.740
Are they going to sue the Spirit Store for selling monster costumes?

01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:50.140
I tried suing a lot of people.

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:51.940
Get over it.

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:56.660
They should have to pay for all these fucking terrible lawsuits.

01:40:56.740 --> 01:40:59.780
I mean, if somebody is putting out a drink named Monster, then fine.

01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:02.420
You're with the word monster and then find that never been.

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.340
Well, they should they should never hurt their fucking IP.

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:09.820
Well, they should never have let them have Monster as a trademark.

01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:12.460
Monster Energy should be a trademark.

01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:15.100
But Monster itself should have a generic for that.

01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:19.420
But of course, our our copyright and trademark system is broken.

01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:22.740
And so because of that, you have people like Monster,

01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:25.380
you know, registering that as a trademark.

01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:29.540
And you have to say, did they sue Lady Gaga?

01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:32.420
She ate my heart, doo doo doo doo.

01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.220
Well, I mean, her little monsters.

01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.780
That boy is a monster.

01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:37.900
She has a song called Monster.

01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:40.820
Yeah, it'd be different if like this thing was like,

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.180
you know, like Monster Energy, something or other like it was the name of the game.

01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:47.300
Then I would understand.

01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:50.020
But this is just completely ridiculous.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:51.540
And then on top of that, you know.

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:56.460
Sorry, Marissa Chat says Monster was the employment website for old people like me.

01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:58.260
Oh, my God. True. That's right.

01:41:58.300 --> 01:42:00.940
There was a monster was like the yeah.

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:02.980
Monster.com. Yeah.

01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:05.780
No, no, I'm older than you.

01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:09.020
Please do not. Please do not.

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.580
Yeah. We're old enough to remember when you found a job in the paper.

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:15.900
And Monster.com.

01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:19.140
They also filed a lawsuit with at one time.

01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:24.140
They they filed lawsuits against, you know, lots of different things.

01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:28.860
Everything from like restaurants to websites, the forums, the games to.

01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:33.460
I think they even tried to maybe sue Disney or Pixar about Monsters Inc.

01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:37.980
But, you know, for some reason, they're still around suing people.

01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:41.980
So, of course, you know, they've basically

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.620
been giving an agreement or whatever it says.

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:50.020
The overreaching settlement terms that Monster Energy sent the company

01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:52.900
was basically demands in exchange for allowing us to use the name

01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:54.380
Monsters and Mortals.

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:59.700
We never we agree never to name any other game, any variation of the word monster.

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.260
Also, it forces us to never use a green and white logo

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.900
on black background for any game we ever make.

01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:10.220
So they're saying that they own those colors, too, apparently.

01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:14.620
They can they can trademark a color

01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.820
like Barbie Pink is is owned by Mattel.

01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:22.100
OK, but I don't think that they say that they can't make a game,

01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:26.020
even if it's not named Monster, that they can't make a game with those colors.

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.740
Like their logo.

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:30.260
I just think that's overreaching.

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:34.340
So it's just all companies like Monster Energy depend on doing their bullying

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:39.300
and secret while presenting a clean image to their base athletes and gamers.

01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:42.660
Showing their true face publicly is the only way to stop them.

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:46.660
And unfortunately, it won't be because they will, you know, do it.

01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:51.060
But apparently the CEO of glow sick entertainment says they've filed

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:54.060
for summary of judgment to hopefully move the thing along.

01:43:54.060 --> 01:43:56.060
So it's not being dragged out legally.

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:58.940
They need somebody needs to counter Sue to get them

01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.180
to lose that trademark because it can happen.

01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:07.220
I mean, honestly, there's Monster Energy than Monster Cables at one time.

01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:08.100
Like, yeah, I'm right.

01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:10.820
And Monster Cables used to sue everybody as well.

01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:14.020
I would like to see a battle between Monster Cable and Monster Energy,

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:19.860
you know, and then just just get rid of like nullify the trademark.

01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:23.420
Nintendo needs to release a game called Monster, and then they can all fuck off

01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:26.140
together into eternal legal.

01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:33.940
I'm surprised that they did end up suing Pixar or whatever for Monsters, Inc.

01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:35.620
that they didn't like get shut down.

01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:36.820
I'm kind of surprised.

01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:39.900
Yeah, the Disney Disney lawyers are scary, too.

01:44:39.900 --> 01:44:44.020
And I'm kind of surprised they will eat them up better about death.

01:44:44.060 --> 01:44:45.660
Deft is saying Pokemon.

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.740
They went after Pokemon pocket monsters.

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.780
Are you shitting me?

01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.900
How do they still have the I don't know.

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:54.820
Anyway, energy drinks aren't good for you.

01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:59.220
I say I say as I literally down an entire coffee on this program.

01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:01.900
Coffee is not an energy drink.

01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:03.140
No, it's not. Yeah.

01:45:03.140 --> 01:45:05.580
Is the is right is the energy drink.

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:08.540
The only one I accept.

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.780
I don't drink. I've been buying coffee on Etsy, by the way.

01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:12.860
I don't drink that other shit because of coffee.

01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:14.100
Just pointing out. All right.

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.180
I I put my faith in coffee, which sustains me. Mm hmm.

01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:21.340
All right. Thank you, Chad.

01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:23.620
Chad is backing me up. Chad is backing me up.

01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:24.860
I appreciate you all.

01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:26.500
Rob Coffee.

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:28.820
Tiger Claw in chat says, is it decaf?

01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.660
Don't insult me.

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:32.900
I'm just kidding.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.100
No, it is not decaf.

01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:36.060
I've I've been a little detour.

01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:39.860
I've been stepping up my coffee game and I ordered blue mountain coffee

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:43.980
on Etsy and Kona coffee for in K cups.

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:47.260
And it's delightful.

01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:50.180
And it supports small roasters.

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:54.420
And it's a little bit more expensive, but you get some damn fine coffee.

01:45:54.820 --> 01:45:58.780
I do drink decaf once in a great while, but like late at night,

01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.580
like eight o'clock, like that's late.

01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:03.060
Eight is late.

01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:05.260
Well, like relative to bedtime. Yes.

01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:11.020
No, I keep decaf on hand for when Becky comes over

01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:15.420
like to make half calves. Yeah.

01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:17.980
And I will do a decaf

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:21.540
if I'm cold and it's like midnight.

01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:26.940
But I also buy good decaf and not shitty decaf.

01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:31.060
Yeah. You know what?

01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:31.980
I don't like.

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:34.820
OK, first of all, I saw Rhonda's thing.

01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:37.300
We have Keurig's at work, so I buy boxes of variety K cups.

01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:40.620
I do not like the Dunkin K cups and I do not like Starbucks

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:45.460
regular coffee at all because it tastes burnt or dead.

01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.380
I do like their espresso drinks,

01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:52.700
but I must say that I am very, very fond of their iced coffee.

01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.820
I've been getting what's that one brand?

01:46:57.820 --> 01:46:59.260
Is it Green Mountain?

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:00.780
Not that they endorse this or anything.

01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:03.580
I think that that's the same company as Keurig.

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.740
So it's it's their own company, coffee company.

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:09.620
But I like the Green Mountain and Gevalia,

01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:14.180
the Swiss company and donut shop.

01:47:14.660 --> 01:47:16.260
My favorite. Not that they're paying me.

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:17.580
And I don't remember the exact name.

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:20.780
I just know it's the Hawaiian coffee and it comes in the foil bag

01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:22.900
and the K cups are a little more recyclable.

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:25.300
That is like they have like macadamia nut.

01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:28.300
That is the best. It's like Kona or something.

01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:31.820
That is by far the best one. Yeah. For me.

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:36.700
Well, at any at any rate, though, I fucking love coffee.

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:40.540
I like that my I like that my palate,

01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:43.620
because I've been drinking less of it because of my stomach.

01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:48.100
That I've like begun like actually tasting the different flavors

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:50.460
and like I'm becoming a bit of a coffee snob.

01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:52.860
I hear you the other day.

01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:57.500
So Friday, I know that I have told many people that

01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:01.580
that they overroast their coffee to make them last longer Friday,

01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:05.060
which was the start of the third day of deliberations in our trial.

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:09.060
I got a Starbucks that morning and then at lunch.

01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.820
Well, we didn't know if we would be done or not yet.

01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:12.900
I also had a Dutch brothers at lunch.

01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:17.660
I had two designer coffees on Friday because it was that kind of day.

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.140
Did I deserve it? Yes, I did.

01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.100
Every every last drop. Yes, I did.

01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:28.100
To coffee lounge radio.

01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:30.180
I love coffee. All right.

01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.540
You know, it's even better than you know, it's better than any of this stuff

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.700
is going to is gay brunch.

01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:37.740
No gay brunch. A French press.

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.140
That is the best coffee in there.

01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:44.060
No, like, no, it's just no actual fresh fresh.

01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.140
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:48.580
Yeah. Clever, clever drip is better than French press.

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:51.340
Oh, I will fight you on this

01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:52.620
on immersion.

01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:53.740
I'll drink any coffee.

01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:55.660
I'll drink any coffee except Folgers.

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:57.540
Otherwise, I'll drink any coffee.

01:48:58.180 --> 01:48:59.580
Phil's coffee.

01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.380
You and I are going to love Phil's.

01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:04.340
I love Phil's. There's one downtown.

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:05.780
Yeah, that's it.

01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:08.900
We're doing brunch next Sunday.

01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:11.140
They finally they finally opened

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:15.860
the new place under what used to be sidetracks downtown.

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:17.460
That's fine.

01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:19.820
It's going to make the hamburgers.

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:24.380
It is it's a burger place, but it's I think if they don't do a drag

01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:26.940
queen brunch and they're in the wrong part of fucking town,

01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.700
that is all I know.

01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.380
All right, Rob, we're going to brunch.

01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.540
All right. Sounds good. Let's do it.

01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:35.900
All right. Moving on one more thing.

01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:40.420
I don't know how to tie this into brunch, so I'm just not going to bother trying.

01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:44.220
But what could the future of PlayStation controllers look like?

01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.100
Could they actually change temperature?

01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:51.220
Yep. It's a new patent that Sony has filed

01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.700
that talks about how this technology would work.

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:57.260
It would have a elastic member on the controller.

01:49:57.860 --> 01:50:01.300
The elastic could actually change shape, and that's something

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:03.220
that could happen as well.

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:05.780
And then also there would be a sensor that would talk about

01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:08.460
if the elastic is touched, twisted, pressed, pinched,

01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:11.780
washed or rub and measure things like acceleration.

01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:17.460
But then also as a part of this, the elastic piece has vibration capabilities

01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:21.940
and this intensity could actually cause the controller to heat up.

01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:25.860
So the gel material in the elastic could actually change and heat up

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.700
and make it more firm.

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:29.980
So it could be interesting if you're in like a volcano level

01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:31.580
at a type of game or something like that,

01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:33.940
where the controller could actually get hotter.

01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:36.940
That would be interesting. It sounds like a safety nightmare.

01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:41.500
But children, well, sometimes all you need

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:44.740
is the power of suggestion, right?

01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:47.900
Like take a take a ride like Star Tours,

01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:50.660
even though sometimes it feels like you're moving like this.

01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:55.100
When you actually write, it's very subtle movements on Star Tours,

01:50:55.100 --> 01:51:00.340
but watching the screen and if you are a really real Disney freak,

01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:03.100
like some of us used to be, at least anyway here on OLR,

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:06.140
try riding the ride with your eyes closed sometime

01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:08.180
and you'll feel just how subtle the movements are.

01:51:08.660 --> 01:51:11.460
Because when you're watching the screen, though,

01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:15.060
you feel like you're like completely into it.

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.820
And I would say this is the same thing with the temperature change.

01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:22.420
It only has to go up a little hotter to really get that impression of heat.

01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:26.580
I remember the old pinball table Whirlwind.

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:28.340
I think it was what was called, right?

01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:29.420
Yeah, Whirlwind had the fan on it.

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:30.940
Had the fan on it.

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:33.740
And like, it's just this tiny ass shitty little fan.

01:51:33.740 --> 01:51:36.820
But when it blows air on you, you know, you're kind of like,

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:38.980
and she, uh oh, looks like rain.

01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:41.220
And you say, oh, there's a storm coming.

01:51:41.220 --> 01:51:44.660
So when they had

01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:47.660
not California Extreme, but

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:51.460
and not Golden, because Golden State Pinball Festival is coming up next month.

01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:55.100
But the other one, the Pinna-Go-Go, thank you.

01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:58.580
When they had that in Dixon in that, you know,

01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:02.540
non air conditioned place

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:06.300
with all the corn pollen everywhere, which is why I don't do that one anymore.

01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:10.100
There'd be a line around Whirlwind when it got hot.

01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:15.020
Because you just want that fan blowing at you the whole time.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.740
Yeah, for sure.

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:19.020
Yeah, we used to have a Whirlwind.

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:22.340
All right. Well, that was our last slotted story for tonight.

01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:24.260
So it's time for the listener roundtable.

01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:28.460
We're going to open up and for your emails, participate at orange.ontrady.com.

01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:32.660
But we also welcome your phone calls on our Discord server, vog.network.com.

01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:35.060
That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:37.780
And if you want to call in tonight, you can head over to the green room.

01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.940
And so that's a place where you can interact with our show tonight, too.

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.340
Also, I will. Well, let me check.

01:52:43.340 --> 01:52:45.980
I don't think we had emails tonight, but I'm going to check in anyway,

01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.140
just as I always do. We had spam.

01:52:48.140 --> 01:52:48.980
Well, that doesn't count.

01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:51.220
I mean, I'll refresh it right now and see.

01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:54.420
But nope, nothing in there but the dust bunnies.

01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:55.980
We ain't got shit. All right.

01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:57.980
Participate at orange.ontrady.com

01:52:57.980 --> 01:53:00.700
if you would like to put something in our box for next week.

01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:05.580
SSG100Matt says, what was the snowmobile game that was like Hydro Thunder

01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.820
that had a cooling fans during gameplay?

01:53:07.820 --> 01:53:09.460
Yeah, it was Arctic Thunder, wasn't it?

01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:11.780
Mm hmm. Yeah, I think it was.

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:14.300
It was Arctic Thunder logical.

01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:16.780
Let me see. I thought that they were missing an opportunity

01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:20.780
not having like a big ass fan unit on Alpine Racer.

01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:24.140
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's a throwback.

01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:29.420
All right. Let's go quickly over to Loki with some last minute stories,

01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:33.180
and I actually see at least one question in chat here for a discussion topic.

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:34.300
I'll get to that in a moment.

01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:37.300
But Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to?

01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:41.420
Just a screenshot, a little bit of footage from what appears to be

01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:45.100
like an internal video from, I believe,

01:53:46.380 --> 01:53:51.460
Sega. It's showing a remake of Jet Set Radio

01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:55.340
and also a remake of Persona three,

01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:59.940
which apparently someone says that also the website

01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:02.180
for the persona three remake has been

01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:04.340
registered as well.

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:06.220
So maybe that coming soon.

01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:08.780
But the the video, at least a little bit of animation

01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:12.420
they had for the Jet Set Radio remake looks awesome.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.740
All right.

01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:19.060
Mike Deft in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:22.660
asks, we're heading towards the it's off the screen.

01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:26.100
Sorry, we're heading towards the end of the first quarter of the year.

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:30.980
What's the game or games you've liked the most so far this year?

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:32.860
Good question.

01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:36.660
For me, Diablo four, which is kind of cheating

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:38.780
because that game hasn't actually come out yet.

01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:42.780
But y'all know those games are my jam and the beta did happen.

01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:46.420
And so I already know this is going to be a game that is definitely up my alley.

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:51.020
Otherwise, to give another maybe a better answer, I don't know,

01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:53.740
for lack of better term for your question, I would say maybe Hi-Fi Rush

01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:56.180
would probably be the game for a lot of people on their list,

01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:58.500
which, of course, was the surprise rhythm game

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:01.700
action game release that was released

01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:05.260
by the folks that used to do the Evil Within and those games.

01:55:05.260 --> 01:55:08.820
That was the stealth game pass release that came out a couple of months ago.

01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:12.540
I would bet Hi-Fi Rush is probably going to end up on a lot of people's lists

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:15.020
if you would ask that same question.

01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:17.620
Dark Soccer, Loki, anything you'd want to add to that for like

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:21.420
great games so far this year?

01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:23.780
No, because I really haven't played anything new.

01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:25.340
I played my inbox.

01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:28.220
Still catching up from last year, which is fair.

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:28.820
So what happens?

01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:31.580
I like playing my Midnight Suns, and that makes me happy.

01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:34.940
So, oh, my God, how did I forget theater them?

01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:38.340
How did I forget theater them?

01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:42.060
Because it's always so much in your brain that you think of it all the time,

01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:43.740
and so you become desensitized.

01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:47.020
Yes. Correct answer. Yes.

01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:48.460
I'm I don't know.

01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:52.060
I haven't played any new games this year, so I'm just going to,

01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:54.060
because I was scrolling through Twitter

01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:58.140
and this happens to be the game that's shown in front of me here.

01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:00.260
I'm going to say paparazzi.

01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:04.500
It is a game where you take pictures of dogs wearing hats and glasses.

01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:07.420
I saw that. I was like, what the hell is this?

01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:09.700
Looks great. All right.

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:12.620
I'm going to.

01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:16.020
So we had a redeemed post show shout out in our chat.

01:56:16.020 --> 01:56:19.460
I'm going to upgrade that to an on show shout out for free on the house.

01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:24.020
Marissa said, I need more social media followers for my voice acting work.

01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.540
Anyone want to follow?

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:27.820
I'm at Marissa Meisel everywhere.

01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:32.820
Thanks. That's M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.

01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:34.620
Here it is. Get your pen ready one more time.

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:38.620
M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.

01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:43.740
Hit that 30 seconds backward button if you missed it and give Marissa all the follows.

01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:47.260
Because I would love to see Marissa get more.

01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:49.340
I mean, she's already done some great voice acting work.

01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:51.620
I would love to see her get some of the big gigs.

01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:55.220
I want to see Marissa retire to a life of convention circuits

01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.180
like all the big voice actors.

01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:59.500
Marissa deserves that and more so.

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:05.020
All right. Anyway, all right, well, I think I think, believe it or not,

01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:07.740
it's a little bit shorter of a show tonight, but that's OK.

01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:10.620
It was a little lighter with the news because everybody's

01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:13.700
busy at the movies seeing that movie and so forth.

01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:17.660
So I want to thank everybody for participating along with our show tonight,

01:57:17.660 --> 01:57:20.420
whether you were listening, whether you were here live with us on Sunday night,

01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.260
whether you are lurking.

01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:24.380
Hey, we love you all. Thanks for being a part of the show.

01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:26.500
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,

01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:28.420
please tell a friend or two about the show.

01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.260
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:33.380
but we need more voices to put out here on air.

01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:37.100
So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is

01:57:37.100 --> 01:57:39.420
you found this podcast, Spotify, whatever.

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:42.420
I guess Spotify lets you leave comments on individual episodes now.

01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:43.660
I haven't really looked into that much,

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:46.660
but if somebody leaves us a comment, I'll go look for it.

01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:49.500
Do that. Say nice things.

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:51.340
If you leave a nasty comment, I'm ignoring it.

01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:53.660
So but that's yeah,

01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:57.020
those going off a long way.

01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:57.900
So thank you so much.

01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:00.460
That's that's all I got.

01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:03.180
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:06.820
Dark Sakura, who I know is going to go off to play some dead by daylight.

01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:07.940
I'll start with you.

01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:10.380
What is your final thought for tonight?

01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:12.780
About my subathon, because I want people to hang out.

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:16.300
And it's not the subs are like not really the most important thing to me.

01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:21.180
But however, if I reach 250 total, I'll bleach my hair live on stream.

01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:25.020
Um, I will go platinum, y'all platinum.

01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:28.140
But I just want people to hang out with me on my birthday.

01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:30.980
It's April 19th, starts at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:35.060
And I just want people to hang out with me on my birthday.

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:37.140
I can't go to Disneyland.

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:38.540
Can't go to San Francisco yet.

01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:40.940
So hang out with me.

01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:42.860
I'm old. Send Geritol.

01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:47.940
If you want, I'll come bring you some prune juice.

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:50.020
It is a warrior's drink.

01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:53.420
Well, you can just come over anyway.

01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:56.580
I won't be able to be there during the day when I'm working,

01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:58.220
but I'll pop in after work.

01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:59.100
And if you're

01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:03.140
LFG, I'll hop in for at least a couple of games of Debbie.

01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:06.820
So well, and the the sort of palate cleanser games

01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:10.260
are going to be Marvel Midnight Sons and Cult of the Lamb.

01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:15.460
And I think I may be able to attempt a Gartic Phone.

01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:18.500
If you haven't played Gartic Phone, it's kind of it's kind of.

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:21.540
That's that's I've played a party game.

01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:23.740
That is that. But it wasn't called that.

01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:26.580
I usually only ever played it on Nick's stream,

01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:29.060
but I might try hosting it myself. We'll see. It might be fun.

01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:31.740
All right. Well, thank you.

01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:32.900
Thank you, Dark Sakura.

01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:34.900
We'll see you next time. Have a great stream.

01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:41.100
All right. See y'all on flip side and play pinball. Bye.

01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:43.540
I love pinball. I will.

01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:45.220
Loki, your final thought for tonight.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.380
Ever since you were a young boy, did you play the silver ball?

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:51.140
From Soho down to Brighton.

01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:52.260
I don't know the next lyric,

01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:54.260
but I know exactly what you're referencing them all.

01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:56.460
Yeah, I must have played them all. That's all right.

01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:58.060
All right. Bye. Bye.

01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:59.420
All right. Loki, your final thought tonight.

01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:01.180
And don't break out in a song, please.

02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:03.140
I will never do that.

02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:06.780
So my final thought is hopefully we'll have some more content

02:00:06.780 --> 02:00:08.740
on the YouTube channel this week.

02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:10.980
I'm hoping to get one or two videos out this week.

02:00:11.220 --> 02:00:13.180
Awesome. Trying to step it up.

02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:17.620
My final thought, I will definitely be streaming more Final Fantasy

02:00:17.620 --> 02:00:18.980
or not Final Fantasy.

02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:20.420
Well, I'll probably play that again at some point, too,

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:22.180
but definitely some more.

02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:23.380
What's that game called?

02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:24.940
Pokemon Legends Arceus.

02:00:24.940 --> 02:00:26.860
Probably tomorrow going to continue on the main game

02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:29.220
because I did some stuff off stream and I have some new

02:00:29.220 --> 02:00:30.620
Pokemons to show you.

02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:33.020
So I'll be playing that tomorrow after work at some point as well.

02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:34.780
I've got a lot of work to catch up on

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:36.940
since I was out for two weeks unexpectedly,

02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.860
but we'll get there.

02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:40.980
So but that's it for me.

02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:43.780
Thank you all again for participating with our show tonight.

02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.180
I really appreciate you all being here.

02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:47.380
I hope you all have a fantastic week ahead.

02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:48.580
I hope you had a good Easter.

02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:51.020
If that's your thing, Passover, if that's your thing

02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:52.580
or whatever is your thing.

02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:54.740
If just sleeping in on Sunday is your thing.

02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:56.420
I hope I hope it was great.

02:00:56.420 --> 02:00:58.620
Quite frankly, we'll see you again.

02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:01.340
Don't forget your taxes unless you live in a place

02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:03.020
where the deadline got extended.

02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.580
Don't don't forget that.

02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:07.380
And we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.620
Have a great week, everybody.

02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:09.740
Good night.
