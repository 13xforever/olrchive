0	28000	Niantic's business model appears to be to own the augmented reality gaming space. By which I mean the yet another reason to be staring at your phone while outside gaming space. Their concepts for these games are neat, and the attempts at theming it for more players is an okay idea, but I think its notable allure and functionality peaked with Pokemon GO, at least until AR headsets become a thing.
28000	39000	This is the Ready Player Two dystopia in real life. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39000	67000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live one more time with episode number 957 of our show for tonight, April the 23rd of 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined each and every week with my co hosts over there on the upper right of your screen if you're watching live is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
68000	69000	Hi, how are you?
69000	70000	Okay.
70000	74000	Awesome. Sorry, your audio is a little off tonight. That's all right. It's just threw me.
74000	78000	Really? That's what well Shayla was saying that and I haven't done anything.
78000	87000	I think coming through your webcam. That's gonna be my guess. That's what it sounds like. So that's right. While you tinkle with that, why don't I go ahead and introduce?
87000	88000	Tinkle?
88000	93000	You tinker, tinkle, whatever, tinker on the tinkle. Say hello to Mr. Loki.
93000	94000	Hello.
94000	95000	Hi, how are you?
95000	96000	I'm fine.
96000	108000	Good. What is that playing behind you tonight? It's like a Zelda. Is that the, that's the modem Zelda from the NES or no, it was on SNES.
108000	109000	That, that.
109000	111000	That's a Tel Aviv. It's a PS Zelda.
111000	116000	Yeah, no, but it's not PS. It's actually a pretty good remake of Zelda, right?
116000	117000	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
117000	118000	Yeah.
118000	120000	I wish this would come to the eShop.
120000	124000	Right? Yeah. I mean, it's like Nintendo knows how to do their old products, but.
124000	125000	Is this better?
125000	129000	Oh, much better. There we go. There's the dark Sakura we know and love. Hi once again.
129000	130000	Hi.
130000	138000	Hi. You know what? Discord does that sometimes. I've had the same problem. Like Bobby will call. So our pal Bobby Blackwolf, because set up again.
138000	147000	We do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG network.
147000	157000	And I've had, Bobby is always gracious to have me on at the end of his show in a little like holdover kind of way inspired by the Daily Show, Stephen Colbert, that, that whole era.
157000	166000	And sometimes Bobby, I get on with Bobby and he's like, your webcam's the mic, right? So Discord does something funky. I don't know what it is. Like reset your audio.
166000	186000	Every Windows update, it seems to reset. It'll default to default, which it's like kind of throwing a, it's like picking a input at random or something like that. So that'll happen all the time. Like, and I'll get the output as my monitor speakers or something like that. It's like, Oh, seriously, seriously.
186000	193000	So, all right. But we have Jamie and her voice is pristine. So how are you doing, Jamie?
193000	195000	I'm doing all right. I'm a little tired.
195000	202000	A little tired? Well, I mean, you stayed up for 24 hours earlier this week. Happy belated birthday. I know we said happy birthday.
202000	207000	Well, I also went to San Francisco yesterday and hung out with JD.
207000	214000	Oh, shoot. Oh, um, the Sakura festivals in China or Japan town this week, right?
214000	215000	It was over.
215000	222000	Oh, it was over. Oh, that's almost almost. Oh, it's always, almost always right around your birthday weekend. Bummer.
223000	228000	Yeah, I usually can go for my birthday, but this, this time it was a week early and I couldn't get off work.
228000	237000	But I did, you know, I went around and I looked at all this stuff and I was just thinking to myself of the stuff that I was purchasing.
237000	243000	And like, I used to go to Japan video, which is thankfully still there. The arcades gone.
243000	250000	Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff gone, but I used to go and like buy wall scrolls and plushies and all kinds of toys.
250000	259000	And this time I spent more time in SoCo hardware, buying gardening tools and makeup and skincare.
259000	261000	Well, you know, it's interesting.
261000	265000	And congee flashcards. Am I growing up? Stop.
265000	270000	Well, what's also interesting to me, not to say that this affects your taste, I don't think it does,
270000	276000	but I think about how a lot of those plushie stores that were very unique to the Japan town experience,
276000	279000	whether it was us going to San Francisco or even going all the way down to LA.
279000	282000	And I remember they had a really sweet little area there, too.
282000	286000	A lot of those stores feel like now they're in mainstream malls.
286000	287000	Like I was...
287000	289000	There's one in Arden Fair.
289000	292000	Yeah, there's lots of those types of stores.
292000	295000	There was a store at the Galleria in Roseville.
295000	297000	I happened to be out there not long ago.
297000	302000	And it was right next to Build-A-Bear because we were looking at the, because they have some Mario movie.
302000	307000	You can get a stuffed Bowser and you can get a bear in a Mario outfit and peach outfit and all that stuff.
307000	310000	And so right next to that, though, is a plushie store.
310000	316000	And even worse, if you've ever watched Alan stream those crane games, it's the exact same plushies that are in those crane games.
316000	320000	So I'm like, Alan, you're not allowed within a thousand feet of the Galleria.
320000	323000	I can't have you go into that store.
323000	326000	Well, I was even looking at plushies.
326000	331000	There was a Kirby I liked and then there was a Monokuma.
331000	338000	And then I just stopped and I was like, we just found all of my family of Pokémon.
338000	342000	Giant plushies like my Togepi that I got when I was held up at gunpoint.
342000	346000	And my ginormous Charmander pillow.
346000	351000	And what was the other one that I have?
351000	353000	Oh, my giant Miasu.
353000	357000	My Meowth, but I got a Japanese one, so it's Miasu.
358000	362000	And then that was, I was like, I'm kind of good.
362000	365000	I have all these Animal Crossing plushies. I don't have anywhere to put.
365000	367000	I have all these plushies next to me.
367000	369000	Well, I mean, I guess I put them where I put them.
369000	373000	But like, if I could angle my cameras that much.
373000	375000	But hold on.
375000	377000	For those who are watching.
377000	381000	Sure. For those on Twitch, DarkSaga is showing off a bit of her collection.
381000	383000	There's like an Eevee Pokémon. There's a few.
383000	385000	I can't name them all, but there's a lot.
385000	389000	There'll be a Sonic. There's a plush bunny that was got to cheer me up.
389000	393000	A Riolki. A Kerochan.
393000	395000	A DDR machine.
395000	397000	We have so many plushies.
397000	399000	There's like a box full of plushies in the garage.
399000	402000	I love my husband, but I've told him, no more plushies.
402000	405000	No, I've got bags of them.
405000	409000	And somewhere over there, it's like on my Animal Crossing list.
409000	413000	Uh oh, guess who walked into the studio bringing his husband coffee
413000	415000	right as I'm talking shit.
415000	417000	He just walked in here going, I heard you talking shit.
417000	419000	Hi, sorry.
419000	421000	But no more plushies, Alan.
421000	423000	But I did.
423000	425000	He just said, I do what I want.
425000	431000	Get something that I want, even though I have like some big ones that were somebody else's
431000	433000	that I just use as decoration.
433000	435000	I got myself a little Daruma.
435000	437000	That's cute.
437000	439000	And you're supposed to set a goal
439000	442000	and fill in the eyes when you reach the goal.
443000	447000	So this is for a particular goal I have.
447000	450000	And then something I got was a little Kirby blind pack.
450000	452000	Not in San Francisco.
452000	454000	I got it before my birthday.
454000	456000	But it has a little Waddle Dee in it.
456000	458000	Oh, it's cute.
458000	460000	You know what's even better than plushies?
460000	462000	Coffee.
462000	464000	No money. You know why?
464000	466000	And you know what's worse than that?
466000	468000	When you spill coffee on yourself.
468000	470000	You can buy coffee.
471000	473000	I spilled coffee on myself because this thing was a little too full.
473000	475000	So let's get to our drinking problem.
475000	477000	Alan just yelled from the other room.
477000	479000	That's what you get.
479000	482000	Loki, could you get into tonight's kickoff topic, please?
482000	488000	Yeah, so Nintendo had an Indie World Direct that was this week.
488000	492000	And they showed off a bunch of different indie games that would be coming out for the Switch.
492000	494000	And well, of course, other things as well.
494000	498000	So starting things off, just kind of in no particular order here.
498000	503000	We had Manico's Night Market, which looks pretty cool.
503000	505000	It's a fun adventure game.
505000	508000	And they've got this magical cat thing.
508000	510000	I don't really know what that's supposed to be.
510000	513000	But that's going to be coming out on September 26th.
513000	517000	We had a game called Sandrock, or My Time at Sandrock.
517000	524000	Which is, I guess, a game where you're restoring the desert.
524000	527000	It's not much to restore in a desert.
527000	529000	Put more cactus in there, I guess.
529000	531000	Make things drier.
531000	533000	Maybe that's what they need to do.
533000	537000	But some sort of farm management sim in a desert.
537000	539000	Can you have a horse with no name?
539000	543000	I mean, you can do whatever you want in Sandrock.
543000	546000	So you can go through the desert on a horse with no name.
546000	548000	Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
548000	551000	Yep, you can definitely do that.
551000	556000	Plate Up is going to be coming out on the eShop in October.
556000	558000	Which looks pretty cool.
558000	563000	And it's kind of one of those restaurant sim type things.
563000	566000	This is something that looks fun.
566000	568000	I love games with cats in it.
568000	572000	But Quilts and Cats of Calico.
572000	574000	It is a game with a cat.
574000	577000	And there are quilts with a cat laying on said quilt.
577000	583000	And it looks to be some sort of puzzle, I guess, puzzle game.
583000	585000	With the different colors and everything.
585000	587000	I'm not really sure how exactly it works.
587000	591000	But in the game, there are cats walking around.
591000	594000	And you can pet the cats while you're playing the game.
594000	597000	I mean, that's just, that's perfect.
597000	600000	You got to have that in any sort of puzzle game.
600000	604000	Oh, hold on, I got to take a cat petting break.
604000	606000	Speaking of more cat games.
606000	608000	Oh, I'm sorry, I sat down at just the right time.
608000	610000	And if you saw me change my shirt, no, you didn't.
610000	613000	But yeah, the cat game looks amazing.
613000	616000	Yes, speaking of cat games, there's still another cat game,
616000	619000	Little Kitty Big City, which looks awesome as well.
619000	624000	That's like, I don't know if it's similar to say, Stray,
624000	627000	but you know, in the sense that you're wandering a city as a cat.
627000	630000	But this looks like, you know, a little less cyberpunk
630000	633000	and a little more cute cat that's wandering around
633000	638000	and you can, you know, steal fish and talk to birds.
638000	641000	So I like that. It looks cool.
641000	645000	This will be exciting for some of our music game fans,
645000	647000	but there's going to be yet another NecroDancer game.
647000	650000	So we have Rift of the NecroDancer.
650000	655000	It's a kind of like it reminded me a little bit
655000	659000	between Elite Beat Agents and like Guitar Hero type stuff.
659000	666000	So it's got different, I guess they say it's lane based combat
666000	668000	with like kind of the rhythm game type stuff.
668000	673000	But they also have like other minigame things that happen
673000	678000	that look similar to kind of like almost Elite Beat Agents.
678000	681000	Yeah, I can't tell what's happening in this game, which is fine.
681000	685000	I think it's cool to innovate on the rhythm genre a little bit.
685000	687000	And it seems like there's actually more going on here
687000	689000	than just the lane type of stuff.
689000	692000	So, yeah, but this was really cool.
692000	695000	Like obviously music games are always going to be like
695000	697000	a little bit near and dear to my heart, right?
697000	699000	When you consider the history of this show.
699000	701000	But yeah, that looked really cool.
701000	703000	Mm hmm.
703000	706000	So then there's a game, I love the name of this game.
706000	708000	Crimo Clock.
708000	711000	It's a map based crime solving adventure.
711000	714000	It says you go traveling through time
714000	718000	and apparently your actions influence different time periods.
718000	720000	Hmm.
720000	722000	I just like the name Crimo Clock.
723000	728000	Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered coming to the eShop.
728000	731000	Actually, they're out on the eShop because it's one of those
731000	734000	and you can get it now type of things.
734000	735000	So that's pretty cool.
735000	737000	Let's see that coming to the Switch.
737000	739000	Real quick before you get to the next game,
739000	740000	I want to introduce the chat room.
740000	744000	Sorry, my rhythm of the intro got thrown off by my coffee crisis.
744000	747000	So we do tape live, of course, at 9 o'clock Eastern,
747000	750000	6 o'clock Pacific at twitch.tv slash vog network.
750000	753000	And you can chat along with us, such as some folks are talking
753000	756000	about the rift of the necro dancer in our chat right now.
756000	759000	Mike Deff says it actually reminds me of the guitar hero
759000	762000	or rock band with Rhythm Heaven.
762000	766000	And our wonderful voiceover guy VXJ6V is in chat saying
766000	770000	it's guitar hero cross Rhythm Heaven cross WarioWare.
770000	773000	Honestly, you sell me when you talk about it that way.
773000	775000	Dark Tutsi agrees with that description of it.
775000	777000	Pod Culture says I like the art style.
777000	778000	Me too.
778000	781000	I like that video games get more and more and better and better
781000	782000	cartoons somehow.
782000	784000	Like you look at games like that and like Hi-Fi Rush and,
784000	788000	you know, a lot of the modern cartoony games is like, man,
788000	791000	I thought Super Mario Brothers 2 was a good looking cartoon game.
791000	792000	Look at what we got now.
792000	794000	This is great.
794000	795000	Yeah.
795000	798000	They showed off a trailer for a game called Animal Well,
798000	801000	which is coming out sometime next year.
801000	805000	It looks like some sort of like dark exploration game,
805000	808000	which this kind of like.
808000	810000	It's a it's a pixelated style,
810000	815000	but it's like pixelated with like modern like effects on it or something.
815000	817000	They've done this before with different games,
817000	820000	but it looks pretty cool.
820000	821000	And then what else?
821000	823000	Shadows Over Loathing.
823000	830000	It's a hand drawn stick figure style mystery solving game set in the 1920s.
830000	832000	So that's pretty cool.
832000	837000	Blasphemous 2, a 2D action platformer.
837000	839000	That's going to be coming out later this summer.
839000	843000	Oxenfree 2 Lost Signals looked interesting.
843000	846000	That's coming out July 12.
846000	849000	And I guess it's set five years after the first game.
849000	852000	Still haven't played the first one, but this looks really cool.
852000	854000	It's kind of like almost like an adventure type game.
854000	855000	Yeah, Oxenfree.
855000	856000	Oxenfree is kind of neat.
856000	859000	I did play a little bit of the original because it was actually like one of
859000	861000	the first like game pass games.
861000	864000	I remember checking out because it was on game pass for a while.
864000	867000	And it was a pretty popular game from those.
867000	869000	I have to admit, I didn't get very far,
869000	872000	but those that played it and beat it are awfully fond of it.
872000	875000	So I feel like the sequel's been in some ways a long time coming because
875000	877000	you said it's set five years after the first.
877000	881000	I feel like the first game's been out longer than five years too.
881000	883000	It's been a while.
883000	886000	It looks interesting with the whole like radio mechanic where you can kind
886000	887000	of tune in different things.
887000	889000	And the art style's really amped up from what I remember.
889000	890000	Not that it was bad before.
890000	891000	It was very stylish.
891000	894000	But this is like really definitely a new level for this.
894000	896000	This is cool.
896000	897000	Yeah.
897000	901000	Then they started talking about a little bit of DLC for different things.
901000	905000	So we have a little to the left cupboards and drawers DLC.
905000	907000	I'm not sure what that is.
907000	910000	I guess it's arranging drawers and shelves.
910000	912000	Cool.
912000	913000	OK, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
913000	915000	I have to I have to know more about what that.
915000	916000	Tucked away.
916000	917000	Sorry.
917000	921000	This is what I get for trying to manage the trailers and that stuff on the fly.
921000	925000	So this is I do not know what this game, but it looks like what's unpacking
925000	926000	or that moving game.
926000	929000	It looks a lot like that.
929000	930000	Kind of.
930000	933000	Actually, this stage looks like Operation.
933000	936000	So it's like shove stuff in there.
936000	937000	Yes.
937000	938000	Oh, and there's a cat in this game.
938000	940000	So already we're we're loving that.
940000	942000	So, OK, sorry.
942000	943000	Thank you for humoring me.
943000	946000	I just had to know more about this game, but that looks cute.
946000	950000	Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is getting some DLC as well with.
950000	953000	They are having two new playable characters and more puzzles,
953000	957000	and that's going to be out for free probably soon because it says it's for spring.
957000	965000	Called The Lamb Relics of the Old Faith update is coming actually tomorrow.
965000	966000	I am so ready for this.
966000	969000	I have been waiting.
969000	971000	Jamie, what is this all about?
971000	975000	Because I know you've played plenty of Cult of the Lamb because I know you've been streaming it and so forth.
976000	982000	It's going to be like some new buildings and a permadeath mode and a boss rush mode.
982000	989000	Maybe I think new people to recruit into the cult.
989000	991000	I mean, I've already finished the game once.
991000	996000	I think I would kind of consider starting from the beginning with the new content.
996000	1001000	I just spent 48 dollars Canadian.
1001000	1003000	Just now.
1003000	1005000	On what?
1005000	1010000	On the third Dead by Daylight soundtrack.
1010000	1013000	I was like, what are you buying from Canada?
1013000	1015000	Okay, got it.
1015000	1018000	And the US one is like way sold out.
1018000	1020000	I see, I see.
1020000	1024000	Cult of the Lamb DLC looks pretty cool.
1024000	1025000	More games.
1025000	1027000	We had Brotato.
1027000	1028000	I love that name.
1028000	1032000	It's a twin stick shooter, kind of that like hand drawn.
1032000	1034000	A few friends have been playing that.
1034000	1035000	Brotato?
1035000	1038000	Yeah, it's like a...
1038000	1045000	Yeah, I don't know if it's necessarily, I mean, it's got that kind of vampire survivor type of look to it.
1045000	1052000	So I mean, it's a very similar type of style game there, it looks like.
1052000	1056000	Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach came out later that day.
1056000	1058000	So that's out on the Switch now.
1058000	1060000	Bomb Rush Cyber Funk.
1060000	1068000	That's going to be coming out on August 18th on the Switch and of course other systems, but you know.
1068000	1070000	I like your name.
1070000	1075000	It is the game that is kind of like sort of spiritual successor to the Jet Set Radio.
1075000	1078000	So, you know, that might be worth checking out.
1079000	1086000	Escape Academy Complete Edition is going to be out here pretty soon.
1086000	1089000	This fall actually on the Switch.
1089000	1093000	I guess it's already been out on other platforms, but now coming to the Switch.
1093000	1101000	And then there's a game called Chance of Sennar, which kind of like a stylistic looking game.
1101000	1105000	I saw some comparisons to Journey.
1105000	1108000	Maybe not that, but it does look cool.
1108000	1111000	Kind of like a puzzle adventure game.
1111000	1113000	So that's pretty neat.
1113000	1115000	I think, was that everything?
1115000	1117000	Oh, Paper Trail.
1117000	1122000	This is kind of a, it won a lot of awards, that's for sure.
1122000	1125000	Some sort of narrative adventure game.
1126000	1131000	Where you have like pages that you can manipulate to like solve puzzles and stuff like that.
1131000	1133000	Kind of like folding things over.
1133000	1138000	So a very kind of full Nintendo Indie Direct.
1138000	1141000	Lots of stuff in there.
1141000	1144000	And obviously the music game fans are very happy because I'm looking at our chat.
1144000	1149000	We have some more comments, even more comments on NecroDancer and all of that as a series.
1149000	1152000	VXJ6V points out NecroDancer's bloom has been pretty fantastic.
1152000	1155000	The original game, Cadence of Hyrule, and now a new experience.
1155000	1157000	And then Bobby Blackwell fads onto that.
1157000	1161000	There's that crypt of the NecroDancer pinball table in the new pinball FX.
1161000	1164000	They try to make you flip to the beat.
1164000	1166000	I'm not sure how you would do that with pinball.
1166000	1169000	That's very interesting, but I'm sure, you know, because it's virtual, there's a way to do it.
1169000	1172000	So I'm very curious about that one for sure.
1172000	1179000	And then of course, that Bomb Rush cyber funk being a spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio has attention.
1179000	1184000	Shadley Lindershane is in chat, hello, saying Bomb Rush cyber funk is a day one purchase easily.
1184000	1187000	I cannot wait for that. Feels like it's been in development for forever.
1187000	1189000	So I'm happy it's about done.
1189000	1195000	Mike Deft also happy with the release date and Dark Tetsuya reminding us that it has music by Hideki Naganuma.
1195000	1198000	So it's definitely trying to recreate Jet Set Radio.
1198000	1205000	Yeah, I mean the art style, the music, it's pretty interesting.
1205000	1206000	That's also very interesting.
1206000	1214000	You have this, you know, indie spiritual successor coming when there's always those rumors about Sega reviving some other legacy properties.
1214000	1222000	Yeah. And that that one is I don't know if that's just fan wishing or, you know, if it's I mean, the screenshots are out there, the videos out there.
1222000	1223000	So like, I think it's coming.
1223000	1226000	It's just like, yeah, the leak or whatever.
1226000	1229000	I mean, like soon or later, it could be.
1229000	1230000	And that's fine.
1230000	1235000	Both can exist, you know, perfectly fine.
1235000	1236000	Yeah, I don't know.
1236000	1237000	We'll just have to wait and see.
1237000	1239000	I mean, what?
1239000	1243000	Not E3 is right around the corner.
1243000	1250000	What a June release, nebulous summer game announcement month is coming.
1250000	1251000	E3 is around the corner.
1251000	1255000	I'm looking forward to it.
1255000	1262000	Remind me to write a message on social media the day E3 was supposed to start and say like, hey, I'm at the L.A. Convention Center.
1262000	1264000	Where is everybody?
1264000	1268000	Thought we were getting together today for the biggest event in gaming.
1268000	1273000	Was told there would be an Ouya parking event.
1273000	1276000	I'm sorry, that's that's a few years too late.
1276000	1277000	All right.
1277000	1279000	Let's get into the things that haven't been canceled.
1279000	1283000	And that's the games that we have been playing this week in a segment that we call appropriately.
1283000	1285000	How is your gaming week?
1285000	1290000	Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week?
1290000	1292000	Oh, I'm sorry, you're muted on Discord.
1292000	1294000	I see your icon.
1294000	1297000	Yeah, because I didn't want people to hear me chewing into the mic.
1297000	1298000	Fair enough.
1298000	1300000	My week was long.
1300000	1304000	I played Dead by Daylight on Sunday and Monday.
1304000	1319000	And I, I didn't play on Tuesday as a break, a buffer before the 24 hour marathon, which I made it the full 24 hours where I played Marvel's Midnight Suns as well as Dead by Daylight.
1319000	1321000	I was I was in no shape.
1321000	1324000	I couldn't I don't know half of what I said in the morning.
1324000	1326000	I was delirious.
1326000	1332000	I remember peeking in and lurking for just a hot minute, like because I was very busy with work, so I couldn't really be in there during work hours.
1332000	1335000	But I peeked in just to like, is she still going?
1335000	1336000	And you were still going.
1336000	1339000	I was like, dang, good for her.
1339000	1341000	The 18 hour mark.
1341000	1344000	And I was like, I could do this.
1344000	1348000	The 21 hour mark, I was like, the fuck am I thinking?
1348000	1349000	Oh, fuck's sake.
1349000	1351000	That was like what was going through my head.
1351000	1355000	And then I was saying all kinds of weird shit that I have no idea what I was saying.
1355000	1362000	And then I was going into like that weird sort of mutism I get when I'm really tired and overwhelmed.
1362000	1367000	So I was having trouble speaking like toward the end and I made it through.
1367000	1373000	And actually, big shout out to everyone who played with me.
1373000	1382000	Haim, who is a new friend, C-A-I-M, a newer friend who I bought stickers from on Etsy and we became friends.
1382000	1388000	And Fixation Gaze and Shayla and Gwen.
1388000	1392000	Gwen was with me a big chunk of the time, of course.
1392000	1398000	And also to our new friend Feathers, who we met in Q and joined in and played.
1398000	1399000	So hi, Feathers.
1399000	1405000	Actually, Feathers also won a sticker on one of the giveaways.
1405000	1413000	And along with that, some of the redeems, if we hit certain levels with it, I would do plies on stream and releves.
1413000	1415000	So I did some plies and releves.
1415000	1418000	So I got some exercise in.
1418000	1422000	And crap.
1422000	1423000	Oh, yeah.
1423000	1427000	And I got a bot raid, a follow bot raid, you know.
1427000	1429000	So I had to go in and remove that.
1429000	1431000	That's still a thing?
1431000	1432000	Apparently.
1432000	1433000	Well, they're not saying anything.
1433000	1435000	They're just following.
1435000	1446000	And I turned off the alerts, you know, and I ended up banning first and then removing them, you know, so I wouldn't get in trouble.
1446000	1451000	And apparently the potato song that's a redeem on my channel is copyrighted.
1451000	1452000	Who knew?
1452000	1453000	Oh, who knew?
1453000	1458000	So only that part, though, is silenced.
1458000	1462000	So I have to think of something to replace the potato song with.
1462000	1468000	And it might be Brak's I Like Beans.
1468000	1473000	Because I haven't gotten in trouble for playing anything from Brak.
1473000	1480000	But at any rate, it was a pretty good time.
1480000	1482000	It was pretty successful.
1482000	1486000	There were some people I thought were going to be there that weren't.
1486000	1490000	But I understand real life comes, you know, comes first.
1490000	1493000	But I was, you know, a little bummed over that.
1493000	1499000	But, you know, it was just that day after calm down where it's like, was that really worth me doing 24 hours?
1499000	1503000	I feel so weird because, you know, I slept five hours for a nap.
1503000	1505000	And that was all super jittery.
1505000	1509000	And I figured out this because I didn't do any exercising that morning.
1509000	1511000	I just went and plopped.
1511000	1515000	Dan said I was out and I was like, of course I was.
1515000	1523000	And then I didn't stream last night like I normally do because I was getting back from San Francisco.
1523000	1532000	So next Saturday, I will be if I don't do it already, I will probably be beating Midnight Suns on stream.
1533000	1534000	Oh, cool.
1534000	1540000	Because I went and did all the the background friendship stuff off.
1540000	1542000	Off cam.
1542000	1549000	Yeah, and I'm ready to do it, but I I hit gold four.
1549000	1556000	And on Dead by Daylight, which I would have hoped I would have hit gold something and I'm ready to keep going.
1556000	1559000	So tonight back into it.
1559000	1561000	Awesome. Sounds good.
1561000	1567000	Yeah, I dropped in for a little bit and I know I was going to give out subs because I saw most people were giving out five subs.
1567000	1570000	I was like, well, I'm going to one up and give out six so I can be at the top of the leaderboard.
1570000	1577000	But then I saw when I came in the next morning, pod culture had outdone me at some point, brat.
1577000	1579000	Yeah, yeah, he sure did.
1579000	1589000	And honestly, I have to say that I appreciate every last single one of them, especially the people who subbed on their own.
1589000	1592000	I mean, I appreciate the gift subs. Don't don't don't get me wrong there.
1592000	1597000	But for people who thought that I was worth paying an ongoing subscription for.
1597000	1601000	I absolutely I'm over the moon over it.
1601000	1611000	So and and for the new followers that came in, my goal for this month was to hit 700 followers and I did before the subathon.
1611000	1616000	So, you know, I'm just you know, I'm happy to make friends.
1616000	1621000	That's what I wanted was to have friends with me on my birthday, even if we couldn't be together in person.
1621000	1628000	And that's what I got. And I ate a rum cake. It was a little rum cake and and felt really old the next day.
1628000	1641000	And but I mean, I want to thank everybody who came in, who gifted, who gave, who cheered, who subbed themselves, everything.
1641000	1645000	All the support means a lot to me and it means I'll keep going.
1645000	1652000	I have to say your ability to do that for 24 hours is kind of inspired me to maybe do something around my birthday.
1652000	1659000	My birthday's on Monday, though. I don't know. But I don't think I couldn't I couldn't go for 24 hours.
1659000	1662000	There's no way. No way. I'm not even going to promise that.
1662000	1666000	I'm not going to do it again. I'm not going to do it again. Maybe when I turn.
1666000	1670000	The other decade.
1670000	1674000	But because because remember, I turned the years old.
1674000	1679000	Yeah, I know. Well, this year is a big one for me because it's a multiple of five.
1679000	1683000	I am I am an appropriate gamer score for Bobby Black Wolf now, because if you don't know,
1683000	1689000	Bobby Black Wolf will only play Xbox 360 games where the achievements end in zero or five.
1689000	1694000	So he can have a whole number and a whole number.
1694000	1699000	So I will be I will be I know I know it's five isn't really, but it's I guess it's half a whole number.
1699000	1703000	So it works. Have Bobby explain it to you, OK?
1703000	1708000	But I will be a Bobby Black Wolf appropriate achievement number in June.
1708000	1713000	I think Bobby should update it to where his score can only be prime numbers.
1713000	1717000	It might be hard to stay on top of. All right.
1717000	1721000	At any rate. Yeah, it was fun. I had a good time.
1721000	1725000	It was nice to see people and.
1725000	1729000	Nice to sleep afterwards. I bet. All right.
1729000	1733000	Well, on that note, we'll go over to Loki. How was your gaming week, Loki?
1733000	1739000	I just been playing Minecraft and making Minecraft content because I have to do that and keep doing that.
1739000	1746000	You put out a little video I saw. I put out a new video because like I we were talking already about end of season.
1746000	1750000	And wow. Well, I mean, it's up for a while.
1750000	1758000	But I have a lot I got to build, so I'm feeling the crunch.
1758000	1761000	I mean, and I knew that was going to be the case. That's why I started so early.
1761000	1769000	But this also means that I'm going to be balancing my content differently instead of going between a bunch of different series.
1769000	1776000	It's going to be mainly the S&P for a while until I get everything done. But like I am working on stuff.
1776000	1780000	So what did you do in this latest video? Because I brought it up to kind of look at it.
1780000	1785000	But you have to explain Minecraft to me because I'm not as seasoned on it as you are.
1785000	1792000	So Minecraft added in 117. So that was like two updates ago. It added the ability or added copper.
1792000	1801000	So there's copper blocks. They start off as an actual copper color, which is like kind of an orange ish metallic color.
1801000	1807000	And then over time, they will oxidize into that kind of dark green color.
1807000	1812000	And so it's just a mechanic that they added to the game.
1812000	1823000	Yeah. So over time, they'll oxidize. But, you know, if you're going to be building something, you may just want specific colors, you know, to build whatever that is you're trying to build.
1823000	1828000	And so you can actually stop the color changing process by like waxing them and stuff like that.
1828000	1835000	So in Minecraft, though, when you have copper blocks that are close together, it takes longer for them to oxidize.
1835000	1843000	If you space them apart, the proper spacing is four blocks in between each copper block and they'll oxidize the quickest.
1843000	1854000	And so right now, the solutions to do that is you go and find a giant field and you place them all down about five or four blocks apart and then you wait.
1854000	1861000	So I decided to go ahead and build a machine that does it for me, that will space them out properly.
1861000	1868000	And I can sit there AFK to just push them in there. So it's basically this giant conveyor belt of blocks.
1868000	1871000	Oh, my God. That's what we're looking at in this video.
1871000	1875000	Yeah. So it's a giant conveyor belt of blocks. It's like eight layers deep.
1875000	1880000	And so I had to dig out this giant hole to, you know, get it all in there.
1880000	1885000	But basically, yeah, it so allows you to AFK it. There's other solutions that people have come up with.
1885000	1893000	One required you to basically use gravel and like copper blocks and you had to kind of place them down.
1893000	1899000	But you place both of them down. There's another one that someone's come up with on empires.
1899000	1906000	Pixel riffs who made this thing called David because David Copperfield.
1906000	1916000	So his design was basically that you have a flying machine that takes the copper and then it puts it into a machine.
1916000	1921000	It waits for the fully oxidized and then it will automatically collect it and bring it back out.
1921000	1925000	But you still have to manually put all that in there for the flying machine to take it.
1925000	1928000	So I wanted a solution that was different than all of those.
1928000	1936000	And I could just sit there AFK because you can actually get it where Minecraft will hold like one of the mouse buttons down for you.
1936000	1945000	There's a trick to do that. And so I could sit there AFK and it would just process all the copper through the machine without me having to do anything.
1945000	1952000	And so this recycles all of the gravel back so you don't have to worry about placing the gravel down.
1952000	1955000	It's always perfectly spaced apart, stuff like that.
1955000	1961000	So I'm very proud of it because I don't really make like giant redstone things like they're custom.
1961000	1966000	A lot of times, you know, if someone's done something like, OK, I'll just use that because that's probably the best way to do it.
1966000	1974000	And I don't want to I don't have time working a full time job and making content to research and develop redstone like this.
1974000	1979000	So I had I've been wanting to do this for a while and I finally just said, OK, I'm going to do it.
1979000	1984000	And then so I did that and came up with this design and it took some time to get it to work.
1984000	1987000	But then now it does and it's great and I love it.
1987000	1992000	All right. Well, congrats on the latest video and hopefully everybody's already following your YouTube at Loki O.L.R.
1992000	1996000	But if not, here's here's a chance for folks to correct that.
1996000	1999000	Getting close to a thousand. Almost there.
1999000	2004000	OK. Don't have the watch hours yet. So still got a ways before you can monetize.
2004000	2008000	But it's getting there. Another two thousand watch hours.
2008000	2011000	You'll get there. You'll get there. All right.
2011000	2015000	Everybody leave leave the videos on in the background this week.
2015000	2020000	Did you did did you see that I reposted your channel today?
2020000	2024000	I didn't see. Thank you. You're welcome.
2024000	2028000	And because I actually watched your video. Oh, thank you.
2028000	2036000	All the way. Yeah, we're going to I'm trying to make stuff for the next Robot Master.
2036000	2042000	So I'm actually I've been trying to build a Moby.
2042000	2047000	Do you remember the Moby is it's a giant whale. Yeah.
2047000	2058000	Yeah, I'm trying to build a whale right now. It's it's it's I don't know how I how easily I did the the giant octopus and the fish before.
2058000	2063000	But like I it's been a while since I tried to like model one of those things.
2063000	2068000	And now it's it's tough, but it's going to be awesome.
2068000	2072000	You have a giant whale for no reason. Just because I want to giant whale.
2072000	2082000	I do have to say with the opening inside your your building, I had like this major art deco vibe just with all the squares and then how the chandeliers and everything were laid out.
2083000	2089000	I was like, oh, this is classy. It's a classy joint. Yes.
2089000	2093000	With with Mega Man's face. You got it. Yeah.
2093000	2098000	I have to incorporate somehow. Otherwise, it's just like just the base. It's got to have Mega Man stuff everywhere.
2098000	2103000	I can't wait because at the very end, I'm going to build Wily's castle at the top. It's going to be cool.
2103000	2109000	But yeah. All right. Got to get it all done.
2109000	2114000	All right. Well, my gaming week, I actually beat a game on stream this week. I'm very proud of myself for doing that.
2114000	2119000	And that was, of course, Pokemon Legends Arceus, which I've talked about a few weeks now on this show.
2119000	2123000	I did actually play the game to completion. I beat it on Monday stream.
2123000	2130000	But here's the thing. Like most Pokemon games, just because you kind of beat it and roll credits doesn't mean there's that's the end.
2130000	2134000	There's usually like a postgame quest and most of the mainline series.
2134000	2139000	I like chasing down, I think, I think it was the legendaries actually in Sword and Shield.
2139000	2144000	I think you just beat the last trainers. They actually go get the legendary after the fact, after the credits.
2144000	2152000	So this one, it's kind of similar. You get one of the legendaries at the end of the game, but then you're kind of chasing down a bunch of other legendaries.
2152000	2156000	So I did play through of that. I actually beat it pretty quickly in a Monday stream.
2156000	2163000	So I streamed some of that on Monday. It's more that on Tuesday where I was actually going around collecting quite a number of legendaries in the game.
2163000	2168000	I won't get into too much of the detail, although I know the game's been out a year. It's pretty hard to spoil at this point.
2168000	2176000	But then I kind of hit the point where it's like, OK, now if you want to unlock anything else story related, there was a pretty big plot twist reveal.
2176000	2181000	I mean, it was it was really obvious that it was coming, but it was a big reveal.
2181000	2190000	We love a reveal. And there was a big reveal with the end of that kind of legend collecting quest and a really tough fight, actually, that I didn't beat the first time on stream.
2190000	2194000	And then to kind of keep going now, you have to like finish the Pokedex.
2194000	2202000	And so that's a big like that's a big ramp that I don't think I'm going to actually play to completion on stream because I'm ready to move on and do some other games.
2202000	2208000	And I'm going to try to move into the Final Fantasy pixel remaster probably tomorrow.
2208000	2218000	I'm actually working in the office this week, so my timing might be a little off, but I'm really itching to get into the pixel remasters now that they finally released on PlayStation and Switch.
2218000	2225000	I know they've been out on Steam, but, you know, there's there's the new releases with the better font and some of the quality of life things that they've put in as well.
2225000	2235000	So I'm excited to dive into that. Otherwise, for my gaming week, mostly the Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3, I actually did by daylight a little bit.
2235000	2243000	I haven't been playing a lot lately, but they did the big rebalancing stuff and I was kind of curious, like, oh, how does this change the game?
2243000	2245000	Maybe I'll try some of these tome challenges.
2245000	2256000	So I've actually been playing a little bit. And one thing I guess I kind of do like is that because maybe the meta is a little harder to find right now, I do feel like I see a bigger variety in perks right now.
2256000	2264000	I just see killers using like different perks. It's not all the same. It's not like not every killer has Call of Brine. It's different now.
2264000	2269000	Even the same thing with survivors. You know, usually you see like, oh, every survivor has Dead Hard.
2269000	2277000	So I do like that right now. And that's been cool. I still have never gone against a Skull Merchant.
2277000	2285000	The one I'm seeing now all the time is Hag. I guess because some of the changes they did to Boons make her a little more attractive to play or whatever.
2285000	2289000	More people are playing her. That's for sure. So I've been seeing her a lot. Never.
2289000	2297000	But I did play a game as Skull Merchant to do a tome quest and I would have fucking got my Adept if I went to the right exit door.
2297000	2304000	The exit doors were really spread out and the survivor picked the right one and grumble grumble. Oh, well. Oh, well.
2304000	2313000	I still was very impressed that I even got a 3K with Skull Merchant because I'm not a great killer. But anyway, that's been my gaming week.
2313000	2320000	So let's get back into some there's actually a little other thing, too, but it comes up in a story that we have later on. So I'll wait to talk about it there.
2320000	2325000	So let's get into some news. Loki, you want to start us off?
2325000	2335000	Yeah. Atari is buying back their old catalog of games from Accolade, Infogrames and Microprose.
2335000	2342000	So they said that they've acquired 100 PC and console titles from the 1980s and the 1990s.
2342000	2351000	This is the steep catalog includes groundbreaking award winning titles from Accolade, Infogrames and Microprose.
2351000	2358000	The list has not they haven't said which titles have been purchased so far,
2358000	2365000	but it's exciting because I'm curious to see what they're going to do with all that stuff now that they have it.
2365000	2372000	We can get get some new new Atari games. Is Atari coming back?
2372000	2383000	I don't know what the plan is here or maybe it could be, you know, because the recent retro Atari collection, the Atari 50 was pretty well received.
2383000	2391000	So I wonder if maybe they're not trying to assemble the troops for another type of museum retrospective type of game.
2391000	2394000	You know, especially maybe some more obscure computing classes. I don't know.
2394000	2397000	It's a wild, wild guess. They mentioned some of them.
2397000	2404000	OK, so some of the titles that were acquired. Bubsy. It's time for a new Bubsy game.
2404000	2411000	Hardball, Demolition Racer, 1942 Pacific Air War.
2411000	2420000	Man, I remember playing that. F11-7A and F14 Air Combat Series games.
2420000	2427000	I wonder if they got Accolade's comics. I don't think I've ever done that for a classic game when Jamie's been out.
2427000	2430000	I thought you've talked about it. I remember you talking about that.
2430000	2436000	But that was because I played a shitload of that game as a kid. That's where I remember Accolade from was that game.
2436000	2441000	Yeah. The only Accolade game I can remember was Test Drive 3 that I used to play.
2441000	2446000	Oh, yeah. Accolade did the Test Drive series. That's right. Those games were really big when they first came out.
2446000	2459000	Grandpa's going to tell you a story about the golden age of gaming, but those were really some of the first person car game experiences on a home computer.
2459000	2467000	It was like Forza or Project Gotham Racing way a long time ago.
2468000	2476000	It was Test Drive 3. I remember it was so hard for me as a child to understand how to play it.
2476000	2481000	They had buttons for the windshield wipers and your turn signals and everything like that.
2481000	2484000	I just want to drive into Lamborghini. That's all I want to do.
2484000	2488000	You'd crash your car and stuff like that. You had to be very careful.
2488000	2494000	I, of course, did not stay on the roads. I just went straight through the dirt to wherever I was going.
2494000	2500000	And, you know, hopefully I got there quicker than the other cars. I did not.
2500000	2510000	Keep in mind that Atari as well as a whole in the racing genre really was like at a peak in that because remember that was the era of hard driving, stunt driving.
2510000	2514000	And those games that were really like that was those games.
2514000	2520000	I really can't underestimate how big those games were, especially in the arcade for a period of about three years.
2520000	2525000	It kind of came and went. But like stunt driving especially was huge.
2525000	2529000	Or was that what I might even get the fucking names right. I think that's what they were. Right.
2529000	2533000	Hard driving had the loop. And then because everybody loved the loop, they took it a step further.
2533000	2537000	And stunt driving had like the corkscrew and all the other stuff. Right.
2537000	2541000	I think so. Yeah. So I remember playing nineteen forty two.
2541000	2546000	My dad's friend had like a PC with nineteen forty two.
2546000	2551000	Like I remember we went over to their house one time and I was like playing nice here. Here's a game you can play.
2551000	2556000	You know, it's like an air combat game. So I got hooked on that for a little bit and that was fun.
2556000	2563000	Once again, though, like as a child. I could take off in a plane, land it, probably not.
2563000	2568000	It was fun while it lasted. I'm sorry. I just had a I had a mind blown moment.
2568000	2573000	I got to go back to Accolade a minute and go back to that game Accolade Comics that I played like all the time as a kid.
2573000	2577000	I just I brought up the Wikipedia just to make sure I was like thinking about the right game because I was like,
2577000	2581000	was it named Accolade Comics or was it named after the hero in the game?
2581000	2587000	I never knew this about the game. The game was created by the co-founders of the Canadian firm Distinctive Software,
2587000	2592000	Jeff Sember and Don Mattrick.
2592000	2598000	The guy that ruined Microsoft made one of my favorite games as a kid. What?
2598000	2603000	The guy that murdered Xbox's trajectory.
2603000	2609000	Wow. Wow. Then again, look at Tim Sweeney.
2609000	2613000	I guess so. Sometimes the greats fall. What can you do?
2613000	2617000	Sometimes the greats fall.
2617000	2623000	Sometimes you look at your heroes as a kid, you go, damn, what was I thinking?
2623000	2627000	Anyway, sorry, I just had a mind blown moment. But I also.
2627000	2632000	Rob, what? A broken clock goes correct twice a day.
2632000	2636000	Yeah. Well, that that game was very correct. That's for sure.
2636000	2642000	But I remember another series that Accolade was really big for was that Bubsy was their series, wasn't it?
2642000	2646000	Yes. Yeah, he was like the first one that they mentioned on there. Oh, my bad.
2646000	2651000	And the hardball series. I remember those baseball games were very big, too.
2651000	2658000	Yeah, that's that's another one that they had mentioned there as well. So I'll be interesting to see what they do with this.
2658000	2664000	Star Control. That's right. They used to. That was another big game that Accolade had as well.
2664000	2668000	I remember that used to play the hell out of Star Control.
2668000	2673000	S.H.A. 100 Matt is putting, don't forget the Elvira games might be in this acquisition.
2673000	2679000	I feel like her likeness stuff would have to be relicensed. I'm not sure how easy that would be.
2679000	2683000	But those those PC games were really cool.
2683000	2688000	Miss Peterson controls her stuff very, very closely. Yeah.
2688000	2694000	Yeah. But she's also not. She finally stopped making appearances as Elvira.
2694000	2700000	I know she's threatened to retire like four times now, but I think she finally did stop. Really interesting.
2700000	2708000	I mean, I will know maybe I think the last thing that she had licensed herself out for, though, was maybe the pinball.
2708000	2716000	Well, she's still making appearances. She last appeared to sell virus, to my knowledge at the not scary farm thing.
2716000	2721000	Was it right before the pandemic? I feel like it was maybe twenty nineteen or something because she used to actually.
2721000	2727000	Yeah. But anyway, it's a new test drive unlimited game coming out this year. Is it really?
2727000	2732000	Yeah. Test drive unlimited solar crown. It's not obviously made by Atari.
2732000	2744000	It's made by Nikon or that's his publishing, I think, and being developed by Katie Racine, who has made what now?
2744000	2750000	WRC. That's a very good series to do some pretty good racing games on the topic of Elvira.
2750000	2755000	Orange right does point out they did manage to license the pinball game for pinball arcade.
2755000	2760000	So fingers crossed, saying, I know that might be different. Well, it is still her likeness.
2760000	2768000	And she had already, though, licensed out for that. I'm talking about the last stern one that came out for her.
2768000	2776000	Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, maybe there's there's a possibility. Tiger class says was the likelihood they remaster those games.
2776000	2783000	I believe referring again to the old Elvira PC games or remake them. Dude, I'd be thrilled if we got another Elvira video game.
2783000	2792000	Like, I know the pinball tables have been sweet and I'm a fan of those, but I'd love to see another like like very tongue in cheek camp, pure camp PC adventure game.
2792000	2801000	I'd so be about that, but I don't know. I don't know if I see it. I feel like I don't know. I don't I don't know.
2801000	2809000	I'd I'd be thrilled, but I'd be very surprised. But in a pleasant way, it's it's it's incredibly nice.
2809000	2818000	It is. That's kind of the thing. That's the part I hate to say is that, like, just the kids today don't appreciate Elvira the way our generation does.
2818000	2822000	2022 she was in the Munsters.
2822000	2831000	And as her last drive in with Joe Bob Briggs as Elvira, as Cassandra Peterson, because I know she's still doing appearances as Cassandra Peterson.
2831000	2841000	I actually know that was those were just roles. Dr. Elvira was 2021 Netflix and Chills with Dr. Elvira.
2841000	2849000	Oh, she did do some new specials for one of the streaming services, but I thought it was shutter. But interesting.
2849000	2855000	Yeah. Anyway, it looks like the others. She was just herself. Yeah.
2855000	2860000	So anyway, interesting. I'm also curious what they're going to do in this catalog expansion.
2860000	2867000	Now, somebody, of course, in chat had made the, you know, as Joe and Matt said, they're probably coming to the Atari VCS.
2867000	2875000	Is that really a factor anymore? Like, haven't we written that off at this point? I mean, maybe Atari hasn't, but haven't we tried to stop make fetch happen at this point?
2875000	2885000	Like, isn't isn't the Atari VCS kind of a write off? I would feel like Atari would be smarter to repackage these into a really uber type of retro collection like Atari 50.
2885000	2892000	But I don't know what the sales on Atari 50 were like that. That's really what's going to drive everything is. Did it sell, you know?
2892000	2908000	Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, surprisingly, I think the VCS did better for itself than we thought. But like, it's still just a computer. I mean, that's all it really is. It's not like a console. It's just like, it's a computer with some software bundled in type of thing.
2908000	2927000	So that's kind of a little disappointing. But at the same time, it's probably the safer bet to take. And it did okay, I think. And at the very least, we got, you know, some nice collections out of that stuff. So I don't see them launching a new console. But yeah, let's do some more Atari 50 things because those are pretty cool.
2928000	2949000	All right. Well, moving on to modern games and what the future might bring for us, or will bring for us. Well, if it doesn't get canceled, we had the announcement this week kind of out of the blue that Niantic, makers of Pokemon Go and Capcom have teamed up for Monster Hunter now. It's going to be a Monster Hunter title for iOS and Android.
2949000	2966000	And of course, because it's Niantic, you bet is going to use the maps of you know, the real life locations that their other games have brought. And we'll be bringing this game out later this year. You can sign up for a beta test on the official website if you want.
2967000	2990000	John Hanke in a statement said Monster Hunter now will be the ultimate experience for anyone who has dreamed of facing off against epic monsters and battling them with friends filled with fantastical creatures engrossing hunting and opportunities for teamwork with the best possible graphics on mobile devices. Monster Hunter now is the perfect franchise to bring into the real world. Now I will say this, I was looking at the trailer and looking at the trailer.
2990000	3008000	I couldn't quite tell if maybe portal scanning and pokestop scanning was finally being used because it sure looked like the monster was kind of interacting with the loop. But you don't know how much they're embellishing for the trailer, right? It's like the first Pokemon Go trailer that showed Mewtwo flying around the sky and 1000 people trying to raid.
3008000	3037000	That's not really what the game looks like. They were just trying to get out that idea of raiding. So I can't really take this stuff at face value. But when I saw that, I was like, Oh, are we finally going to see what all that scanning is kind of brought with this game? I don't know. But I will say the graphics for a Niantic game did look pretty good. I was like, who did they did? Was this one of the companies they bought or contracted with to do this? I don't know. Because it looks like it's actually being made in Japan. And the announcement of this was very it was like midnight for us. It was it was it was like midnight.
3038000	3063000	Eight in the morning Japan time. So or a more reasonable time of day Japan time. So I'm very curious about that. So um, and looking at some comments in chat. Let's see. darktatia says I was into the Monster Hunter stuff for at least a little while. So curious to see how this plays. Fifth Dream says $5 for three monster battle passes of tongue in cheek comment about latest Niantic controversy.
3063000	3092000	Shane says I'm over my excitement for Niantic Mon hun the idea of supporting Niantic again, was enough to squash my desire to play. Which brings us to another point is that it does seem now at this point, that with the latest controversy from Pokemon go a couple weeks ago with the you know, remote raid passes going up in value and the number you can do in a day limited. It's been a couple weeks and Niantic has not responded to the fan backlash. They have this got announced instead.
3093000	3122000	In fact, Niantic actually made a tweet and I don't remember the exact contents of the tweet but it was something it was a parody of a Rotten Tomatoes post that was saying going outside is rated 100% and they got ripped to show they had to take the tweet down because so many people were bitching them out over what had happened in Pokemon go. It seems very interesting that Niantic has willfully chosen at this point to not respond to the Pokemon go situation.
3123000	3140000	They probably figured that people are going to forget about it. Like people have forgotten that they made a Monster Hunter movie and it probably was terrible. Just just this is your reminder that that isn't a thing that exists in this world that we live in is a Monster Hunter movie that probably nobody saw.
3140000	3169000	I still feel like bridges are being burned that can't be repaired. And what I mean by that is like content creators, influencers and that sort of thing. I have some friends from the Dragon Con circuit that do a long running and I believe fairly popular enough at least it was when it was first out Pokemon go podcast. It's actually called the Pokemon go podcast that tells you how early on they got in there.
3170000	3193000	I have been graciously invited this week on to what is going to be their last episode. Because they're over it.com and they want to take their chemistry that they have the two of them and do I believe I don't know all the details but I believe I saw that they snuck a backdoor pilot for a new show into their Pokemon go feed as podcasters sometimes do.
3193000	3197000	Garfield go podcast. I'm so psyched. I can't wait.
3223000	3248000	I'm actually frustrated that they're fucking up so bad. And what I mean by that is that the last time this happened, they literally promised, promised to communicate more with their fans and do these regular updates. Not only is their latest announcement completely not involving any of that.
3249000	3269000	But like to go so far as to then not even respond two weeks later is like, kind of offensive. To be honest, a real slap in the face to everyone who stuck by them after the first time. Like Niantic I want to love you but you're making it really fucking hard. You've got to fix this.
3269000	3298000	And I'm not saying you necessarily like have to reverse course on everything. But you've got to make commitment to do better and show it. And I swear to God, the thing that's the like the most damning thing in this whole thing. It's not even like the remote raid and all the time. I mean, it ain't cute, but it's not even that. Go look at the Reddit post. It's so well done. It is a parody post of a Pokemon go news update of all the things that have happened.
3299000	3324000	All of the changes they've made this year that were rolling back things basically, and they did it all in one big parody post. And when you read that post, you're like, Damn, this game is scale. This game has made a lot of changes for the worst this year. Now, go look at the things that Pokemon go has given us new exciting this year.
3325000	3329000	I'll wait. I'm still waiting.
3330000	3332000	I mean, there's probably some new Pokemon.
3332000	3353000	Yeah, I think we got Bounsweet this week. We have a shiny Galarian Stunfisk. Whoopee shit. Like, Niantic I cannot express what and this is to gaming companies everywhere. Gaming companies everywhere need to learn a fucking lesson from this.
3354000	3364000	You cannot announce these type of changes that are a downgrade in quality of life of your product. That's what it is at the end of the day.
3365000	3380000	Everything we see in gaming, every patch notes we see, everything that rolls out is quality of life improvements. Your favorite MMO, quality of life improvements. World of Warcraft does not look the same today that it did when it first launched. Why? Quality of life improvements.
3381000	3406000	This is a game that had quality of life regression multiple times this year. And what do we have to balance it? Where are the quality of life updates or positive changes or the reason we remove these things was to bring you these things.
3406000	3428000	Not there. That is the, and again, I just did an Ingress event this weekend, but I'm going to tell you what, that was about the people. It wasn't about the game. That was about wanting the people I love to do this thing collectively together. It wasn't about the game.
3429000	3445000	Y'all are on thin fucking ice with your community Niantic. And I'm going to be this bold. Sorry, I did not mean to turn this into a soapbox, but I kind of have to because this is like my passion in gaming right now. I'll play this Monster Hunter game as much as I'm sitting here bitching. Why? Because I love AR games. And that's just the way it is.
3446000	3458000	They should just combine all of them together. We can get the NBA stars in there as well. We can throw, have them throw some Pokemons in the battle to battle the monsters and then some Pikmin will be there.
3458000	3482000	I need to say Niantic. And I'm sorry, I actually know people that work in Niantic and might even work in this area. And this is why I feel like such an asshole. But this has to change. Like you have to be able to look beyond that and say Niantic must do better here. Like what is the worst thing? This doesn't change or the company goes under or gets bought by EA or something because that's where I feel we're headed at this point.
3482000	3511000	And here's what it is. Niantic, you must rebuild your PR. You must release your PR team and you must begin again. You must change your public relations severely. If you can't do that, Catan, Transformers, Peridot, Monster Hunter. It's going that way.
3512000	3526000	Anyway, yeah, and She-Hulk10 honestly with the bottom line in chat, they won't listen until you guys stop paying them. And that is what it's going to take. If you're pissed off enough about these Pokemon Go changes, you have two choices.
3526000	3550000	One, uninstall the game and stop playing it and leave a one star review in the store. That's probably the biggest and best thing you can do. Two, if that really isn't something like maybe like you realize that the gamification incentivizes your own like walking and cardio and your own well-being and that whole type of thing.
3550000	3564000	Then I would say the second best thing you can do is stop giving them money. Go free to play. Do that thing. Just it doesn't matter. The quest doesn't matter. The shinies doesn't matter. You have to be willing to leave that all on the table for this to change.
3564000	3591000	That's it. Anyway, I didn't mean to be so boxy for so long. But it's just like, it's it's gotten to that point. Like I've just like I like two weeks ago, I was like, oh, Niantic. Niantic is gonna do this thing. And they're gonna say, oh, we we reduce the number of coins or whatever, like they're gonna, but like for Niantic to have done nothing two weeks after the fact, but unveil a new game to try to distract people's attention.
3591000	3604000	You need PR CPR. Ooh, I'm gonna I want that phrase. You need PR CPR. That's what it is. You need PR CPR.
3604000	3616000	Let's move on to our soccer. Do you have a happier, more fun, fluffy topic for us? You're muted again. Just so you know, I don't know if you were eating.
3616000	3645000	I had been. I had actually been making snorting noises. But, but, but no, it's, it's, it's not happy. It's kind of what's expected. What is going on right now is there is a survey that was put out. And the survey is about how, quote, older gamers feel more comfortable eating.
3646000	3666000	About their representation in the industry. And this is actually a study put out by AARP, which is the American Association of Retired Persons. Or, you know, didn't we also see Wilford Brimley with them too? You want to know I started getting stuff from AARP when I was in my 30s and I wanted to cry.
3667000	3671000	I get stuff from them too. And I just throw it in the trash. I put it in the round file.
3672000	3689000	Well, at any rate, they of course support more than 38 million people who are over the age of 50. And people who are over 50 do make up a very significant number of gamers.
3690000	3708000	But the survey says that about 70% of players over 50 don't feel like developers notice the big, you know, portion that they represent. And I mean, if you think about it, you know, 50 year old gamers today.
3708000	3724000	They were, you know, playing, you know, growing up with Atari, growing up with Commodore 64, the Apple IIe, the Coleco Atom, Coleco Visions, and just like, you know, we were littler when those were the big thing.
3725000	3736000	But they grew up with this industry. I like to say that we grew up with this industry. And you know, we're not terribly far behind those people.
3737000	3751000	But about 45% of the people in the range say that they play video games at least once a month. Mobile games were included, but there are quite a few who are console and computer gamers.
3751000	3764000	Although a good number of them play Wordle. That's like the big one on there. They're really, really into it.
3765000	3777000	It says that older gamers prefer puzzle, logic, and word games and prefer using their mobile phones. But the number of console gamers among them has doubled to 28%.
3777000	3792000	So, and it's actually saying that more women are playing games than men in that demographic. 53% of women compared to 48% of men. I mean, if you're using a binary.
3792000	3806000	But in general, over the main population, 52% of gamers are women as opposed to 37% of being men. That's total number.
3806000	3824000	The math doesn't add up. So I think that there's like non-respondents and people, you know, who are non-binary maybe perhaps I don't know how I don't have the details of that particular one, but I knew that we were the majority.
3825000	3842000	And then the study also stated that the pandemic did not have a large impact among the older gamers. And there were small increases in the demographics within the over 50 population of gamers.
3842000	3859000	For example, women, people of color. And they found that over the course of six months, the average older gamer is now spending nearly 3.5 more hours playing, increasing from eight and a half to 12 hours of average gaming.
3859000	3875000	So, and it's just, it's just really interesting, you know, and we don't really, I guess, think about, you know, what constitutes as old versus older, you know.
3875000	3890000	We, and it's kind of hard for, I think, even people who are close to that to start, you know, thinking of ourselves as, as nearing that range. You know what I mean?
3890000	3904000	But we are the ones who grew up with the industry. I mean, I, I mean, when people say, oh, 50 year old gamer, I don't blink twice at it, you know?
3904000	3916000	I don't either because, because of the fact we have grown up with video games, like, and, and, but we remember a time as kids that the 50 year olds would look at us and go, ah, it's a kid thing. Video games are for kids.
3916000	3927000	But obviously that perception has shifted significantly because now that we're the 50 year olds or, you know, within 10 years of it, like, we're the ones that grew up with the games now.
3927000	3937000	And it's not such a weird, I think more and more people realize whether they want to or not, gaming is for everyone. Right? I mean, the fact that-
3937000	3940000	There's not a stigma with it that we experienced.
3940000	3949000	Right, right. I think, you know, the fact that more women play games than men, that, that, that news has actually been out there for a few years now that to me, that's not surprising.
3949000	3960000	I'm sure to somebody whose head is, you know, in the ground, it probably is a little more, but that just kind of goes to show you like how mainstream gaming is. It is literally for everyone.
3960000	3974000	Yeah. And, and well, of course, you know, you also add in the, the, uh, the fact that we have, uh, more accessibility options for people as well.
3974000	3994000	Sure. I mean, I mean, heck, even Dead by Daylight just put in, um, a visual terror radius like they have in the mobile version for, um, for people who, uh, have hearing issues and they've changed, uh, like the way Spine Chill works where it's all visual as well without the audio cue it used to have.
3995000	4004000	But even, even things like color blindness and button mapping are like standard now, like it's, it's more rare you don't see a game have that, which is a good thing.
4004000	4015000	Yeah. Well, I think it's great, you know, but that's also opening the door to increasing the, the, the demographics to poll. Right?
4015000	4016000	Right.
4016000	4030000	So I think, and on top of that, as the, I don't want to put it so morbidly, but the oldest of the group are dying out. That's it.
4030000	4035000	That's what happens to humans when they reach a certain age is that they eventually cease to function.
4035000	4041000	Yes. Older people are more likely to statistically cease. Yes.
4041000	4064000	Oh, and, and so, but you think about what's replacing that, that area. I mean, just cyclically, you know, I mean, think about interviewing people who were a hundred years old, for example, and, and knowing what they lived through.
4064000	4077000	I mean, people who were there for the advent of the car, or, or even, I'd say more like it's, it's earlier manufacturing days, people who lived through the depression, people who lived through all of this.
4077000	4086000	We're not having people who know what the world was like before certain technologies, you know, that's a constant cycle that's happening.
4086000	4094000	It's all phasing out. All we have are, you know, the modern archeologists and sociologists keeping track of these things.
4094000	4107000	You know, people who preserve, like, like, you know, why can we talk about preserving old video games, you know, but people who preserve the technologies and the understanding and, you know, reenact the ways of life.
4107000	4125000	But, but eventually there's going to come a time where there's not going to be anyone in a modern, modernized, what's the word I'm thinking? I shouldn't say modernized, but like in a more westernized.
4125000	4136000	I don't want to use that term either. I'm just going to say in a more technologically standard area that won't not know what a video game is.
4136000	4137000	Right.
4137000	4146000	And won't remember a time that they didn't exist. Because it didn't. For them, it never, there was never a time it didn't exist.
4146000	4147000	Right.
4147000	4149000	So, I'm just saying.
4149000	4166000	It is interesting, you know, you're right, as gamers just get older, because more people, you know, the average age of a gamer gets older because more and more of us grew up with them, kind of going back to what the story was all about, where there's many people that feel like an afterthought, you know, representation in games has obviously been huge for bringing more people to the table.
4166000	4178000	That's why you see more, you know, women as the leads in games, you see more people of color, not saying that we've, hooray, we've won the battle. I'm not saying that, but I'm saying you're saying more than you did in the 80s, that's for sure.
4178000	4181000	But we're the greater number and the least represented.
4181000	4194000	Right. And what I'm getting to is where do you see the games that have people over 50 as the protagonist? Does God of War count? I don't think he's supposed to be 50 in that. I just know he's old. I don't even think.
4194000	4218000	And it's, it's funny, because even for like a long time, there's so much in media and stuff that where it's like, the folks are way younger. Star Trek. So Picard just ended, right? I'm not gonna say anything about that. But, but it has me thinking about the next generation and all that, right? Like, wasn't Captain Picard supposed to be something like 47 in the first season of The Next Generation? And it's like-
4218000	4221000	Which makes sense for someone at that rank.
4221000	4231000	I guess, but you look at, you know, you're like, he wasn't 47. I'm 47, almost. It's just, it's just, you know, or go look at video games.
4231000	4242000	You know, Final Fantasy characters are rarely over the age of like 18 or 19. And so many of them feel like, weren't they like in their 40s? Nope, they were supposed to be a lot younger. So it's just very-
4242000	4246000	Look at it right now. Nicole Kidman is 55 years old.
4246000	4261000	Oh, wow. You know, like, when I stopped to think about that, that makes sense. But I go, she still doesn't. Well, I say she doesn't look it. What the fuck does that mean? What the fuck does that really mean? She doesn't look the way I've been conditioned to think a 55 year old looks like.
4261000	4263000	Sandra Bullock is 58.
4263000	4264000	Good for her.
4264000	4280000	I mean, and they can also, you know, afford, you know, surgery and injections. But I mean, they're, they're, people don't look like I think what their age is expected to be.
4280000	4281000	Yeah.
4281000	4301000	You know, like, I mean, yeah, I dye my hair. I'm still not totally gray at the root. You know, my mom didn't go white until she was like in her late 50s. You know? Yeah, the Wilford Brimley was, was 50 years old when they did Cocoon.
4301000	4303000	That comment from Bobby Black Wolf and Chet.
4303000	4304000	Yeah.
4304000	4305000	Yeah.
4305000	4329000	But I'm saying that we need to stop looking at a number and having an expectation. I mean, it's not gonna, it's not gonna happen, but it's what needs to happen if I think if companies want to be inclusive of all of their demographics, you know?
4329000	4345000	Well, on top of that, I think, you know, wouldn't it be funny is that if we had games marketed to the true representation of the, of the number of gamers in certain groups?
4345000	4358000	Right? I mean, one thing about it too, not all of the female presenting character, you know, people out there want to play Barbie or...
4358000	4361000	No, of course not.
4361000	4364000	There's a lot of dance who do want to play Barbie.
4364000	4380000	Yeah. Well, and like, oh gosh, when I was in San Francisco, I saw this guy with like a My Melody bag. I was like, oh, that's a cute bag. He's like, oh, it's my girlfriend's. I'm like, really? I would have had, I was like, if I was a dude, I'd have rocked it.
4380000	4383000	That movie is gonna make so much money.
4383000	4384000	Summer.
4384000	4385000	Oh, the Barbie movie?
4385000	4387000	It's gonna make so much money.
4387000	4388000	I can't fucking wait for that Barbie movie.
4388000	4392000	It's not gonna be from kids. Kids aren't gonna see that movie.
4392000	4402000	Gays rise up. Gays rise up. We're going to come out for that movie in a way that we sure didn't for Bros. Watch.
4402000	4420000	But at any rate, the whole thing is that they need to actually pay attention to what people are playing in these different groups and understand that again, an age is a number and there's still going to be massive diversity and tastes in these groups.
4420000	4421000	Yeah.
4421000	4440000	You can't just say, oh, uh, this person has these chromosomes, so they want to play this or, hey, these people are over 50, so they want to play, you know, uh, uh, sit and fish, you know, this game or they want to do nothing but play wordle.
4440000	4453000	They, it's, it's appreciation, appreciating the diversity and embracing it and then marketing accordingly, you know, creating accordingly. Take a chance.
4453000	4463000	You know, kind of a comment that fifth dream set in chat that has me thinking about all this stuff about like, you know, like marketing and who really are the cool people right now.
4463000	4474000	Uh, fifth dream in chat says I'm starting to look like Jack Black is honestly, if you're Jack, that's a compliment. Like who is having a better month in Hollywood than Jack Black?
4474000	4478000	Who is, who in Hollywood is having a better month than Jack Black?
4478000	4486000	Uh, considering obviously the Mario movie continues to do bonkers numbers, number one at the box office for a third straight week.
4486000	4492000	I mean, granted, the only other big opening was Evil Dead, which I understand is pretty good, but it's, it's an R rated movie.
4492000	4499000	It's always going to have an uphill battle and it's a, it's a hard R as we say, those type of movies are always going to have an uphill battle against the family movies.
4499000	4501000	It's just fact, right? Doesn't matter how good it is.
4502000	4517000	Um, there, there's that and just, you know, obviously Jack Black with his song is everywhere and you know, the remixes and all that stuff like Jack Black is, and it's interesting because Jack Black is probably over the Wilford Brimley line I'm gathering.
4518000	4521000	He's probably the coolest fucking guy in Hollywood right now.
4522000	4531000	Even Mike Deft, who openly admitted his distaste of other actors, which I do kind of agree with earlier in chat says, Jack Black is a treasure.
4531000	4540000	I'm, I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the, ooh, she's different crowd where in chat, somebody did pipe up and say, I don't care for Jack Black, but I'm not seeing it yet.
4540000	4542000	So, so far.
4542000	4551000	But yeah, Quest Buster also Mario movies closing in on a billion in worldwide revenue, revenue, revenue.
4551000	4554000	It's wild and Jack Black is a big part of that.
4555000	4565000	And I don't see that slowing down anytime soon because like you have the, I think, was it, um, I want to say inside out, but it's not inside out, elemental or whatever like that.
4565000	4570000	Um, I don't think that's going to provide much competition for it to be honest.
4570000	4578000	Yeah, I, I, yeah, I think Mario easily makes a billion at this point, certainly worldwide, certainly worldwide guaranteed in the US.
4578000	4586000	Obviously I don't, I don't think it makes a billion, but I think even at this point, like 600 millions in shot and that's still, that's still really good.
4586000	4587000	That's really good.
4588000	4594000	So, uh, and Bobby Black Wolf confirms Jack Black passed the Wilford Brimley line in May of 2020.
4594000	4600000	Imagine if they'd gotten someone just as cool to voice, Mark, you know what, I'm not going to finish that thought.
4600000	4601000	All right.
4601000	4604000	Well, he's having a good week or good month as well.
4604000	4609000	Some, some people, some people get lucky.
4609000	4610000	All right.
4613000	4616000	But, uh, good, good discussion topic.
4616000	4623000	A good thing, especially as you know, the real reality is we're closer to the Wilford Brimley line than we were at the start of the show.
4625000	4629000	And we're much closer to the Wilford Brimley line than when we started OLR.
4629000	4630000	Much, much closer.
4631000	4632000	All right.
4632000	4634000	What do you, what do you mean we're immortal?
4636000	4639000	Does that mean the only way we can be defeated is by having our head cut off?
4639000	4640000	I hope not.
4640000	4642000	Well, none of us will do it, so no problem.
4643000	4644000	All right.
4644000	4645000	Let's move on.
4645000	4647000	Other things going on in the gaming world.
4647000	4649000	Pretty big, pretty big story over here, right, Logie?
4650000	4651000	Uh, yeah.
4651000	4655000	So Sony is acquiring Firewalk Studios.
4655000	4661000	They had worked on, um, probably monsters with them for a while.
4661000	4668000	And now they're working on, I can't tell if this is another game also called Firewalk,
4668000	4673000	but they are working on something to bring a modern multiplayer game.
4673000	4676000	They said that's going to connect players in new and innovative ways.
4677000	4678000	Please be home.
4679000	4680000	It's not home.
4680000	4681000	It's not home.
4681000	4682000	Stop it.
4682000	4683000	Damn it.
4685000	4692000	It says the studio shares our passion for creating inspiring worlds, grounded in exceptional gameplay, and we want to continue to invest in their mission.
4692000	4693000	Cool.
4693000	4697000	Can't wait to see those games come to the Xbox platform, right?
4697000	4698000	Mm-hmm.
4698000	4699000	Right?
4699000	4700000	Mm-hmm.
4700000	4701000	Right?
4701000	4709000	Because we're all about sharing, you know, IP with other platforms, because that's just ridiculous that you would just hoard a publisher or, you know, a studio all for yourself, right?
4709000	4722000	They obviously have an always online game that is filled with microtransactions and season passes that Sony, that is something new to the table that Sony really wants for themselves.
4722000	4723000	Cool.
4723000	4726000	Can't wait to see what that is someday.
4728000	4729000	So.
4729000	4730000	All right.
4730000	4731000	We'll figure out what that is.
4731000	4737000	Well, something we'll be seeing sooner rather than later is Final Fantasy XVI.
4737000	4745000	After all, the game did just go gold, and we know that there's going to be like a live event, and I wish I could go, but I can't take all that time off work.
4745000	4751000	They're going to have a live event in mid-June to kind of launch it, and then, of course, the game is coming out towards the end of June.
4751000	4761000	Well, there's a new feature that's been noticed in Final Fantasy XVI that could be something that kind of changes things up a little bit.
4761000	4774000	Now, of course, we did talk about the state of play already, but you know people are analyzing and taking a look at that and, you know, that whole thing with trying to really dig into everything that they talked about at that state of play and try to see more about the game in there.
4774000	4780000	Now, side quests, big part of every RPG, right?
4780000	4789000	The main character, Clive, can get a list of every available side quest with what's called the Alliant Reports in the Hideaway.
4789000	4798000	But since you have to go get these side quests from the NPC that gives them, you're going to be able to fast travel to any NPC quest giver.
4798000	4807000	So it's taking out, essentially, a mechanic that sometimes can just be, I don't know, sometimes an artificial time inflation or whatever they want to call that.
4807000	4816000	But some are calling this feature a little bit of a game changer. You don't really have to hunt down a side quest to complete it. You go to the board and all the side quests are listed there.
4816000	4825000	Now, they're saying hunts themselves may not actually share the same feature. It wouldn't make sense if it did. You shouldn't be able to transport right to where the hunt is.
4825000	4833000	I imagine it will still work similar to how it did in Final Fantasy XII, but I guess we really won't see until we see the game come out.
4833000	4847000	But some are saying that perhaps this ties into the PlayStation 5's fast loading gig, is that since the PS5 does do fast loading, it's very easy to drop yourself in front of an NPC somewhere in the open world and this whole type of thing.
4847000	4858000	So, could be very interesting. It is being noted that doesn't mean you don't explore the world in Final Fantasy XVI, it's just this optional content ends up getting a little more streamlined.
4858000	4866000	It's a, dare I say, quality of life improvement. So, we won't really know until the game comes out, that's for sure.
4866000	4880000	Fifth Dream in chat says, I miss towns in Final Fantasy. You know, that was a big criticism of Final Fantasy XIII, which they tried to remedy in the sequel in Lightning Returns. Final Fantasy XIII-2 had towns and that whole sort of thing.
4880000	4890000	Certainly XIV has them, and XV has them as well. So, we haven't really seen if there's much outside of just these hideaways in XVI, or the hideaway in XVI.
4890000	4900000	Hopefully there is, but we don't know yet because the game's not out and we can only go off of what they show us. So, we'll see.
4901000	4909000	But yeah, I mean, that game is out in less than two months now at this point, I believe. So, we're going to get more and more info on that game.
4909000	4919000	Another game that's coming out in June, Diablo IV, going to be getting another beta weekend coming up. They decided to do an extra one because they want to test some more features.
4919000	4927000	That game is about six weeks away from release, if you can believe it. And by the way, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, that's like three weeks away.
4927000	4946000	So, here comes summer! But you know what, Dark Sakura, sometimes, you know what, screw all these new games, right? Sometimes you want to play some- this isn't a segue into classic game, I promise, but maybe it's a segue to a piece about a classic game, right, Dark Sakura?
4946000	4956000	Yeah, we actually have something about Skyrim. And it's not necessarily what happened, but what it illustrates about some of these games.
4956000	4971000	So, a person who had been playing Skyrim for a while found a new weapon new to him. A kind of Nord Warhammer after playing for 9000 hours.
4971000	4995000	And apparently new things were added over the various additions, but he's like, I've been playing for 9000 hours and I never saw this. Of course, people immediately started saying, oh, we knew about this, you know, and then like making fun of them a little bit, you know, saying that, like, I played for a million hours and didn't realize you could punch people or something, you know.
4995000	5010000	But the point of this is that it just brings out that it's- this is a game that's probably going to be nearly impossible to not find new things in, you know?
5010000	5012000	Especially if you add mods to it.
5013000	5027000	Well, yeah. But this is actually a unique hammer. It's like the- what was it called again? I'm getting the name of it pulled up because it's hard for me to read. The Honed Ancient Nord Warhammer.
5027000	5038000	And it was added with the anniversary edition. But, you know, on top of what other people have done, they've actually found other pathways through the game.
5038000	5052000	There was a Skyrim player who found a little known path through the mountains that connects the central and eastern parts of Skyrim. And apparently not many people knew about it.
5053000	5068000	So, it's what you get for exploring, you know? And I like to think of this, this is a very interesting thing about this, is that it has very real-world elements on there.
5068000	5078000	You know, having to take different paths and learning different areas and finding out where accessible paths are, you know, it's very, very real life in that way.
5078000	5088000	And I think that it's, it's pretty cool. You know, just a game that's already this old is, you know, still showing off what it's got to give.
5089000	5096000	Almost makes me want to get back in there and play it because I never, you know, like most Elder Scrolls games, you kind of think you're starting on the main quest and then,
5097000	5108000	Distractions! Everywhere! Cave! Go explore! And it's just like, you never, you never, I've never finished Skyrim because of it. So, that's not to say I haven't put many hours in Skyrim, but I just haven't finished it because of that.
5108000	5112000	So, when I hear these stories, it makes me go, oh, I should go back and finish it.
5114000	5116000	All right, Loki, what do you have for us?
5116000	5130000	So, the indie console, the play date has now surpassed 50,000 units sold and actually over 53,000 since it's released one year ago.
5130000	5134000	And it's kind of a unique little console if you haven't seen it yet. It's all black and white.
5134000	5144000	It's got, I don't remember the exact type of screen, but it's like one of the ones that's like on this old e-readers or whatever, very crisp and stuff, but also has a crank on the side of it as well that you can use in games.
5144000	5153000	And with it, you can, I believe games are like kind of time released unlocked in there as well, but I think you can also purchase stuff.
5153000	5160000	I know there's a bunch of stuff on itch.io that you can buy and import or sideload into it as well.
5160000	5168000	And I think they even have like a development kit and stuff that you can make games for the actual play date and stuff. So, it's pretty cool.
5169000	5179000	But yeah, I kind of wanted to check it out. I remember they were kind of backordered for a while, but right now, you know, they are still backordered.
5179000	5184000	They're not expecting to be shipping more units until the later months of 2023.
5184000	5188000	And it's like $200. I still would like to get my hands on one someday.
5188000	5190000	It's a good problem for them to have.
5190000	5191000	It is, yeah.
5192000	5200000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat asks, Pixel Poop's play date version, when? Oh, we'll have to see if YYRS has time on his calendar. I don't know if Loki is going to do that.
5200000	5202000	You could turn the crank to poop.
5204000	5206000	Turn that little crank on a play date.
5206000	5211000	It's like one of those, it's like the soft serve machine or something.
5215000	5216000	I don't know about that.
5216000	5222000	You're definitely leaving some soft serve throughout the park.
5225000	5235000	All right, moving on to other games, you know, there was a comment said in chat earlier, Jaskren said, 2023 is shaping up to be an amazing year for gaming.
5235000	5242000	Dare I say, understatement, honestly, like this is a huge year for game.
5242000	5246000	There's everything I've already talked about and I haven't even brought this up yet.
5246000	5254000	Another game that's coming out in June, a little game called Street Fighter 6 that we've talked about a couple of times on this show.
5254000	5257000	And there's a lot of new information on Street Fighter 6 this week.
5257000	5261000	A demo came out just, you want to play a demo? Here you go.
5261000	5269000	So, and it's actually a demo of the world tour mode, which means character creation is available.
5269000	5275000	And so, yeah, I jumped in and played a little bit of this and I laughed my ass off because there's a butt slider and you can turn it up to 100.
5275000	5279000	You probably saw it in tonight's intro and it just makes your ass look ludicrous.
5279000	5289000	Like it's so funny, but there's, you know, all sorts of, but I also, I love that it's very just matter of factly.
5289000	5296000	You can choose that your, you can choose your body type A or body type B.
5296000	5302000	And then on top of that, and A is traditionally male, B is traditionally female, whatever you want to call it now.
5302000	5308000	But then the option after that is, are you male, female, human?
5308000	5311000	And you can choose that too, to go with whatever the body type is.
5311000	5316000	And I just thought that was really cool that, you know, you have that representation just kind of baked in right there.
5316000	5321000	And then obviously when you get into character customization, you can make whatever, you know, looks you want.
5321000	5325000	I thought it was a very rich character customizer, so it's pretty cool.
5325000	5329000	So the demo is out now for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.
5329000	5332000	If you're on Xbox or Steam, you have to wait for this week.
5332000	5339000	So April 26th is when that will come out because PlayStation will only reluctantly put things on other platforms when they happen.
5339000	5344000	No, this is a Capcom thing and I'm sure there was money paid and that's, you know, that's the business.
5344000	5358000	One thing I really liked about World Tour mode, I don't know if you've experienced this yet, but you go and you make your character and you do some warmups and then you go out and like World Tour mode is literally walking up to people on the street and fighting them.
5358000	5359000	It's awesome.
5359000	5362000	And I like that it's not just people.
5362000	5364000	It is, yeah, it's not just people.
5364000	5372000	It's bringing that like Tekken silliness into Street Fighter is what I like.
5372000	5381000	Can bring me bring me the screenshot chat of Capcom's like museum on the there's like a plaque of all of Capcom's titles in there.
5381000	5384000	Somebody bring me that screenshot because I need to put it up on the screen.
5384000	5385000	Have you seen this Dark Sakura?
5385000	5396000	There's a really cool little reference to like every Capcom fighting game, like, well, I shouldn't say every fighting game, but I think everything that takes place in the Metro City universe, I think was on there.
5396000	5398000	So it's really cool.
5398000	5400000	They have some cool little flourishes in there.
5400000	5403000	So, yeah, yeah.
5403000	5405000	Somebody can dig up that screenshot.
5405000	5406000	I'll bring that up.
5406000	5408000	But yeah, it looks cool.
5408000	5414000	Like, I got to be honest, like when I first saw the World Tour mode, like in the trailer, I was like, oh, that looks lame.
5414000	5420000	And now that they've kind of fleshed it out and show what it looks like, it's like, OK, no, actually, that's pretty cool.
5420000	5421000	That's pretty cool.
5421000	5426000	Also, they have announced who the new fighters will be coming to the game.
5426000	5430000	Rashid from Street Fighter V, AKI.
5430000	5435000	I don't think it's Aki because it's like A.K.I is a new character coming out as well.
5435000	5438000	And then Ed from Street Fighter IV and V will also be there.
5438000	5443000	And of course, Akuma will also be there in spring 2024.
5443000	5445000	So that's pretty cool.
5445000	5446000	All right.
5446000	5447000	I need to bring my girl back to it.
5447000	5448000	OK.
5448000	5451000	Dark Tetsuya actually found this on.
5451000	5453000	He actually posted this on his Twitter.
5453000	5457000	So let me put that up there for Dark Sakura, producing on the fly.
5457000	5459000	Here it is, I'll make that a little bit larger.
5459000	5469000	So this walkway in World Tour mode that mentions like Street Fighter, Final Fight, Street Fighter II, Saturday Night Slam Masters, Dark Stalkers, Final Fight III.
5469000	5475000	It like shouts out everything through like it's like a little like time capsule type of thing.
5475000	5476000	So I thought that was really cool.
5476000	5481000	Just a nice little touch to the history there of Capcom.
5481000	5482000	Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.
5482000	5484000	Gold star for you for finding that.
5484000	5485000	So that's pretty cool.
5485000	5495000	Yeah, I would actually I know you probably are building up a backlog of games yourself, Dark Sakura, but I definitely recommend that demo if you have a moment just to just to see kind of like how they've done it.
5495000	5497000	It's very different from Street Fighter IV.
5497000	5498000	It really is.
5498000	5499000	So it's pretty cool.
5499000	5502000	I did play Street Fighter VI at TwitchCon.
5502000	5503000	Oh, right, right.
5503000	5505000	Just so you know how the game plays.
5505000	5506000	Right.
5506000	5509000	I'm sure I'll, I'll get a chance to.
5509000	5511000	Yeah.
5511000	5514000	TigerCon chat saying Metro City is also the city for Final Fight.
5514000	5515000	Oh, yeah.
5515000	5522000	I mean, some time ago, they've kind of married the universes of the Street Fighter and Final Fight.
5522000	5523000	Those universes.
5523000	5532000	I don't know if it's been married since the beginning, but certainly since Street Fighter IV at least, but I think it was earlier than that.
5532000	5535000	The guy with the car that keeps getting trashed.
5535000	5536000	Yes, there is.
5536000	5538000	Oh my God.
5538000	5539000	Oh, my car.
5539000	5545000	And Saturday Night Slam Masters was in that same universe because Mike the Mayor was a character in Saturday Night Slam Masters.
5545000	5546000	I remember that.
5546000	5551000	You know, we were actually watching like old Game Sack today and they're talking about games that never left the arcade.
5551000	5556000	And one of them was Saturday Night Slam Masters 2, which played more like a regular fighting game.
5556000	5558000	I forgot there was one.
5558000	5560000	Yeah, well, I don't think it came out over here.
5560000	5561000	Ah, that would be why.
5561000	5563000	Still, yeah.
5563000	5570000	I wonder if any of the characters in that would have traits that are available.
5570000	5573000	I haven't really played through this because I only really did the world tour mode.
5573000	5577000	But Bobby Black Wolf says they do have the esports commentator feature in the main arcade thing.
5577000	5582000	And you can even have the commentator root for your opponent and give them support when you destroy them.
5582000	5586000	Oh, I love that.
5586000	5588000	That's pretty cool.
5588000	5592000	Tigerclaw says, I think Cody from Final Fight was in Street Fighter IV.
5592000	5593000	They all were.
5593000	5597000	Cody, Guy, and Mike were all in it at some point.
5597000	5599000	Like, I think it was like DLC.
5599000	5602000	But if you get to the ultimate version of Street Fighter IV, they were all in it.
5602000	5605000	So, I think Cody was just in maybe the base or the plus.
5605000	5608000	But Guy, I loved playing Guy in that game.
5608000	5610000	Yeah, Poison.
5610000	5612000	A lot of characters came over from Final Fight.
5612000	5613000	It was cool.
5613000	5615000	So, all right.
5615000	5616000	Moving on.
5616000	5618000	Oh, Dark Souls 3 says he wasn't in Street Fighter.
5618000	5620000	I thought they did put him in Street Fighter at the end.
5620000	5622000	But I guess I could be wrong.
5622000	5624000	I think he was in Ending.
5624000	5631000	No, he was a background character on, I want to say on Ken's stage?
5631000	5634000	Well, in Dark Souls 3 it points out he was in MVC3.
5634000	5637000	So, it's possible my wires are just crossing with that.
5637000	5639000	So, yeah.
5639000	5640000	All right.
5640000	5643000	Anyhow, yeah, I was really excited about that demo.
5643000	5645000	I would encourage you all to check it out.
5645000	5654000	So, anyway, let's get into our next segment and take a trip back to the era of Street Fighter like one or two or maybe four.
5654000	5655000	We'll see.
5655000	5658000	No, it was more like three.
5658000	5659000	All right.
5659000	5660000	Well, we'll get to it.
5660000	5661000	Let's do the bumper.
5661000	5679000	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault when you're launching a new product classic and tell you about it.
5679000	5683000	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
5683000	5685000	Sorry, we had some audio leak in there.
5685000	5689000	What is the Classic Game of the Week Dark Sakura?
5689000	5691000	Hatofo Boyfriend.
5691000	5693000	And I thought I had done this.
5693000	5696000	I thought very for certain I have done this.
5696000	5698000	And I have not.
5698000	5704000	So, we're doing Hatofo Boyfriend, my original stream game.
5704000	5717000	At any rate, it is called Hatofo karashi kibo no gakuen to shiroitsubasa, which translates to Hatofo Boyfriend, a school of hope and white wings.
5718000	5722000	It is a doujin soft otome visual novel.
5722000	5728000	It first came out in 2011 for Windows and OS X.
5728000	5735000	And all of the characters except the protagonist are sentient birds.
5735000	5736000	Yes, that's right.
5736000	5737000	They're birds.
5737000	5747000	It was developed by a manga artist named Hata Moa's doujin circle, which is Pigeonation Inc.
5747000	5756000	And it is the successor of a flash game of the same name that was created for April Fool's Day in 2011.
5757000	5776000	There is a free demo of Hatofo Boyfriend that was made with the famous Rider engine that was released later that year with a commercial release on October 30th, 2011 at Kometer 98 with an English version released February 2011.
5776000	5781000	International remake was done by Mediatronic and Devolver Digital.
5781000	5791000	And it was called Hatofo Boyfriend HD in Japan, which came out on September 4th, 2014 for Windows, OS X, and Linux.
5791000	5798000	And then for PlayStation 4 and Vita on July 21st, 2015 in North America.
5798000	5802000	And then July 22nd, 2015 in Europe.
5802000	5807000	And there is an iOS port that was released in 2016.
5807000	5815000	It's an interesting game.
5815000	5820000	There has been so much more about it than just the game.
5820000	5824000	Like, it went from an April Fool's joke to a full-on franchise.
5824000	5825000	Seriously.
5825000	5831000	So the game itself is one thing.
5831000	5834000	It has another mode that you unlock.
5834000	5839000	I'll go into that in a little bit, but it's called Bad Boys Love.
5839000	5852000	And then there's the sequel, Hatofo Boyfriend Holiday Star that came out December 29th, 2011 with the English version that was released on Christmas Day the next year.
5852000	5862000	Apart from the main game, there was a webcomic that was serialized in Manga Life Win Plus.
5862000	5874000	Different supplementary materials, doujin works that have been released, four drama CDs, and an episodic web series as well.
5874000	5877000	So we'll get into some of those in a bit.
5877000	5889000	But it is an interactive text-based visual novel that has a branching plotline, as they do, where your decisions determine which of the multiple endings you'll receive.
5889000	5908000	The title pun is a Waseigo word, Hatofuru, where they're basically Japanese language expressions based on English words or parts of word combinations that don't exist in standard English.
5908000	5914000	Kind of like having a portmanteau, but not quite.
5914000	5916000	And yes, fifth dream, san is the best.
5916000	5918000	Oto-san is great.
5918000	5920000	Oko-san, sorry.
5920000	5933000	But anyway, Hatofuru can be pronounced heartful, but it also is based on Hato, which is either pigeon or dove, and the creator.
5933000	5950000	So it's basically set in a version of Earth that's populated by sapient birds, and the main character is the only human going to an all-pigeon school called St. Pigeonation's Institute, which is an elite school for birds.
5950000	5955000	And she finds love amongst the birds.
5956000	5967000	However, there's an alternate story mode called Bad Boy's Love, where basically you go through...
5967000	5982000	After you've dated everybody, gone through everyone's story, and this is not going to be a spoiler for a now 12-year-old game, you play through the story a certain part and then you get killed.
5982000	5991000	And then the true story starts with the pigeons finding your body, and it gets dark.
5991000	5998000	It's so good, though. The story is so good. You find out all kinds of weird shit about this world.
5998000	6002000	I actually never knew that plot twist. That's interesting. Wowee.
6002000	6005000	Really? I thought you watched me play some of the Bad Boy's Love.
6005000	6011000	Not the whole thing, start to finish. I try to realize the context. I certainly watched you play this on and off, but...
6011000	6019000	Bad Boy's Love was, though, at the time, the longest stream I'd ever done back in 2018, I think I did it.
6019000	6029000	But at any rate, it's like any visual novel to play. You click the mouse or hit a button, your enter key.
6029000	6035000	You can save at any point in the game, which is also good if you choose the wrong path.
6035000	6039000	And then you can skip dialogue and all the usual stuff from a dating sim.
6039000	6047000	But you can name your character, but if I remember correctly, I think her default name is Kyoko,
6047000	6055000	which has to do with the peel sound of a bird, of a little chick.
6056000	6066000	And so you go to classes. You have different decisions that determine who it is you're going to end up with.
6066000	6075000	You can also choose which classes you want to attend, and they raise one of three stats, depending on your activity.
6075000	6082000	And those also have to do with getting a good ending for your love interest.
6083000	6086000	And to make the story advance.
6086000	6095000	There were originally 13, there's now 14 in the 2014 remake endings in total, which is one for each of the main love interests.
6095000	6100000	Three extended endings for three of the love interests based on stat values.
6100000	6108000	And one ending for the Gaiden story, Torimi Cafe.
6108000	6113000	And another ending if you fail to romance anybody.
6113000	6118000	When everything is completed, you get pictures and documents.
6118000	6127000	And when you get all of that, you're prompted if you want to fulfill a promise or live a normal life.
6128000	6131000	A normal life will take you through a normal playthrough.
6131000	6136000	If you fulfill the promise, that's when you go to Bad Boys Love or BBL,
6136000	6145000	where you can get to the plot that some of the stuff in the other standard ones foreshadowed to or referred to.
6145000	6154000	There's dream sequences, there are memories, there are different scenarios.
6154000	6164000	It basically transforms from a dating sim to a murder mystery, psychological thriller type of thing.
6164000	6169000	And it's a very, very long, this actually makes the majority of the games length.
6169000	6172000	The dating sim parts are really quick in comparison.
6172000	6176000	There's changes to gameplay, the way the text is displayed.
6176000	6181000	Saving is disabled except at certain points in the story.
6181000	6190000	So the controls almost changed a little bit more of a 90s turn-based roleplay during some of the segments.
6190000	6196000	Anyway, in the universe, I know I'm really going into it, but it's one of my favorite games, so whatever.
6196000	6203000	In this alternate version of Earth where the birds have taken the place of humans,
6203000	6215000	it's a post-apocalyptic dystopian future where after a pandemic of a mutated strain of H5N1, bird flu,
6215000	6221000	that it's wiped out most of humanity by the year 2068.
6221000	6231000	And so this counter-virus that was supposed to destroy the birds carrying it,
6231000	6236000	instead backfired, and they developed human-level intelligence.
6236000	6244000	And so there was war between the uplifted birds and the humans, and the birds came out as the dominant life form,
6244000	6247000	and most humans succumbed to disease.
6247000	6257000	There was a human insurgency, and then many humans have been forced to live in the wilderness, be hunter-gatherers.
6258000	6270000	And so after the open warfare ended, they were adjusting to the birds taking over,
6270000	6277000	and trying to do more things for peace between the remaining humanity and the birds.
6277000	6282000	And there's these different parties, the war dove and the war hawk,
6282000	6289000	their symbols used to show factions who supports the humans, who supports the doves, who wants peace, etc.
6289000	6296000	And so your character is invited to go to St. Pigeonations as a symbol of goodwill.
6296000	6305000	But you've got different characters. You have Ryota, who is a rock dove, and he sometimes dresses up as a maid.
6305000	6307000	I'm not kidding.
6307000	6315000	You have Sakya Lebel Shirogane, who is a fantail pigeon and a snobbish aristocrat.
6315000	6321000	Then you have his half-brother Yuya, who is a secret agent.
6321000	6326000	You have Nageki, who is a mourning dove who never leaves the library.
6326000	6328000	Hint, hint, he's dead.
6328000	6334000	Okasan! Yay! Okasan is the best, because he's fast and not very smart.
6334000	6342000	He's only barely evolved mentally, and he's obsessed with pudding.
6342000	6348000	There's Anjel Higurei, which is based off of the Luzon Bleeding Heart,
6348000	6353000	and he lives his life like he's in a roleplay game, a fantasy game.
6353000	6359000	Kazuaki Nanaki, who is a narcoleptic button quail, who's a teacher.
6359000	6364000	There's Iwamine Shuu, who is a creepy chukar partridge.
6364000	6366000	Hold on.
6368000	6370000	This is him.
6371000	6375000	Wait, are you showing it on camera? Because I'm still showing the other game.
6375000	6378000	This is my plushies.
6379000	6382000	I have a plushie of Shuu.
6382000	6385000	I'm trying to get to it, sorry.
6385000	6387000	Here we go.
6387000	6390000	This is Shuu, with his tie.
6394000	6398000	This isn't great for the podcast listeners, Jamie. We gotta keep it going.
6398000	6403000	I'm sorry, but at any rate, now I'm covered in pigeons.
6403000	6408000	You also have new characters, who is a javasparrow called Azami.
6408000	6411000	She actually shows up in the regular story, but now she's dateable.
6411000	6416000	And then Tori, who is a golden pheasant for the Gaiden story.
6416000	6424000	And so, basically, you've got all kinds of different systems to use.
6424000	6430000	You can show how they would look like as a human, instead of as birds, and that's it.
6430000	6433000	I'm not going to get into more of the story.
6433000	6437000	The holiday star is definitely, you have to find out who's stealing Christmas stuff.
6437000	6441000	But yeah, pigeons.
6441000	6444000	Alright, there it is.
6444000	6445000	Go ahead.
6445000	6448000	I'm just saying, there was a Kickstarter for all of this stuff.
6448000	6451000	So, I got in on it.
6451000	6453000	Alright, your classic game of the week.
6453000	6459000	Hataful Boyfriend, certainly one of the more unique games to come out last decade.
6459000	6469000	I would say games like maybe Dream Daddy or something happened because of Hataful Boyfriend's underground success of sorts.
6469000	6472000	I just think people like the quirky.
6472000	6474000	Yeah, people like the quirky.
6474000	6475000	Alright.
6475000	6477000	Hey Rob, I want pudding now.
6477000	6479000	Who doesn't? Sounds good.
6479000	6483000	Alright, let's travel around and check out some other rapid fire news.
6483000	6487000	Some other quick headlines here before we get back into what else is going on in gaming this week.
6487000	6488000	So, Loki.
6488000	6497000	Yeah, so we have an announcement of a THQ Nordic Digital Showcase that's going to be happening August 11th.
6497000	6503000	They haven't said what announcements are going to be made or talk about what games they're going to be showing.
6503000	6510000	But I'm sure it'll be cool and I'll completely forget about it by the time it comes out.
6510000	6513000	But I can't wait to see what games they have.
6514000	6529000	And then we got news that the indie game Iron Lung, which is some like indie horror game, is being adapted to film by a famous YouTuber and I guess now filmmaker, Markiplier.
6529000	6533000	So that's supposed to be coming at some point as well.
6533000	6537000	So that's interesting.
6538000	6549000	Right now they said that we know it's going to co-star Carolyn Rose Kaplan and he's financing the film by himself.
6549000	6550000	Wow.
6550000	6552000	With that YouTube money.
6552000	6553000	Yeah.
6553000	6554000	That's risky.
6556000	6557000	Alright.
6557000	6558000	Interesting.
6558000	6559000	Yeah.
6559000	6561000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6561000	6567000	We have some stuff coming out for Nintendo Switch Online for the Sega Genesis.
6567000	6574000	What we're looking at is we have Flicky, which is the bird game.
6574000	6582000	We have Pulseman, where an electrified boy goes to stop a bad guy inside a computer.
6582000	6584000	We have Kid Chameleon.
6584000	6588000	We have Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition.
6589000	6590000	And yeah.
6591000	6592000	There we go.
6592000	6595000	That's nice to see Nintendo is still updating the online library.
6595000	6596000	So it's good.
6598000	6599000	Alright.
6599000	6604000	And then one more story for you in this segment that has to do with a 4.20 announcement.
6604000	6605000	That's right.
6605000	6607000	This was put out on 4.20.
6607000	6610000	I'm not sure what this series has to do with that holiday.
6610000	6611000	Maybe the date was just a coincidence.
6611000	6617000	But with Fast X, or Fast 10, if you will, because it is the 10th Fast and the Furious
6617000	6620000	movie that's going to be coming out this year in May.
6620000	6625000	Probably the movie that finally ends Mario Brothers Run, if not a little sooner.
6625000	6630000	This was announced to be coming an arcade 1-up cabinet that features the Fast and the
6630000	6633000	Furious deluxe arcade game.
6633000	6636000	I believe dates back to probably the first game, honestly.
6636000	6637000	Or the first movie.
6637000	6638000	Maybe the second movie.
6638000	6639000	Maybe the second movie.
6639000	6644000	But this cabinet will have the Fast and the Furious and the Fast and the Furious.
6644000	6646000	What was the other game that they made?
6646000	6647000	Tokyo Drift.
6647000	6648000	Thank you.
6648000	6649000	Tokyo Drift.
6649000	6653000	Both of those games will be in this cabinet, which can be yours for $599.99.
6653000	6657000	That's a pretty steep price for two games, but with all the licensing.
6657000	6659000	I mean, the Terminator game costs that much at first, too.
6659000	6661000	It just makes me upset, though.
6661000	6662000	I mean, I get it.
6662000	6665000	Like, this is obviously a tie-in for the movie.
6665000	6669000	But, like, these games are essentially cruising USA.
6669000	6671000	Like, in Cruisin' World.
6671000	6675000	Can we get Cruisin' USA and Cruisin' World, please?
6675000	6680000	Uh, you know, arcade 1-up still seems to be doing well, because they're, you know, they're
6680000	6681000	still making these machines.
6681000	6683000	So, I mean, anything's possible, I suppose.
6683000	6687000	But, uh, I think this is also a Best Buy exclusive, they were saying.
6687000	6690000	Because I think that's, or at least that's who's doing the pre-orders right now.
6690000	6694000	So, um, but also, I don't think Target sells arcade 1-ups anymore.
6694000	6695000	I think they phased them out.
6695000	6696000	Walmart still has them.
6696000	6700000	Um, but I think it's kind of a little more limited where you can get these now.
6700000	6703000	But I think they've still been doing well enough.
6703000	6707000	Like, I think they lasted longer than most people expected them to.
6707000	6709000	So, I would expect these machines to keep coming out.
6709000	6713000	I still, I don't know who the audience is for this game, but, um, I guess, you know
6713000	6714000	what?
6714000	6716000	There's some people that have some really impressive game rooms.
6716000	6717000	Yeah.
6717000	6723000	I gotta say, like, if they ever put out, because they did, like, a home version, if you will,
6723000	6729000	of the, um, Jurassic Park game, except it's just the full arcade cabinet, and it's the
6729000	6731000	full arcade cabinet price as well.
6731000	6736000	But if they did, like, you know, a stand-up version of this, kinda, eh, not exactly like
6736000	6740000	they did Terminator 2, because, or, because the Terminator 2 game, they turned it into
6740000	6743000	Light Gun game, which that game was not.
6743000	6747000	Um, if they did it kinda like that, I would have it down.
6747000	6748000	All right.
6748000	6753000	Well, we're gonna travel around the world and find some games, fastly and furiously,
6753000	6757000	that will be coming out to a store shelf this week, or, of course, the digital store shelf
6757000	6758000	is very popular these days.
6758000	6761000	Uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US?
6761000	6762000	Not a lot.
6762000	6765000	Well, actually, now that I look at the list, there's quite a bit.
6765000	6773000	So, um, we've got, let's see, After Image, uh, that is coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch,
6773000	6777000	PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6777000	6785000	Amanda the Adventure on PC, Fairy Fencer F Refrain Chord on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation
6785000	6787000	4, and PlayStation 5.
6787000	6794000	Uh, we've got R-Type Final 3 Evolved on PlayStation 5.
6794000	6796000	Never put final in your name.
6796000	6802000	Uh, yeah, it's, well, tell that the Final Fantasy.
6802000	6809000	Uh, Stranded Alien Dawn on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6809000	6817000	Strayed Lights on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6817000	6823000	Uh, we have Trinity Trigger on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6823000	6825000	Uh, this game sounds cool.
6825000	6828000	Cassette Beasts on PC.
6828000	6833000	I want to say this was like Digimon almost, if I remember correctly, if this was the type
6833000	6834000	of game.
6834000	6840000	Uh, we have, uh, Honkai Star Rail on PC, iOS, and Android.
6840000	6843000	Dungeon Drafters on PC.
6843000	6850000	The Last Case of Benedict Fox on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6850000	6855000	Live Alive on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6855000	6858000	Mail Time on PC.
6858000	6862000	Uh, Mugen Souls on Nintendo Switch.
6862000	6868000	Omega Strikers on PC, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
6868000	6870000	One, and Xbox Series.
6870000	6877000	Protodroid Delta on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6877000	6887000	Ys Memoir, uh, the Oath of, or the Oath in Felghada, or Felg, I can't pronounce that.
6887000	6889000	Felghana, there we go.
6889000	6890000	I did it.
6890000	6891000	Finally.
6891000	6894000	That's on Nintendo Switch.
6894000	6895000	Um, what else?
6895000	6902000	We've got, uh, last but not least, uh, Star Wars Jedi Survivor on PC, PlayStation 5, and
6902000	6903000	Xbox Series.
6904000	6908000	Well, I think I know why it's a busy week this week, because it's also a busy week in
6908000	6912000	Japan, and it kind of goes back to that age-old question whenever I read the Japanese release
6912000	6913000	dates, and there isn't much on it.
6913000	6915000	The question comes up, is it Golden Week in Japan?
6915000	6916000	Is that why?
6916000	6917000	Well, here's the answer, actually.
6917000	6922000	Golden Week in Japan starts on Saturday, so it's April 29th, I believe is the first of
6922000	6924000	the many holidays in Japan.
6924000	6929000	So, I think what you're seeing happen in Japan this week is very similar to what happens
6929000	6934000	in the US the week before Thanksgiving, and that is a lot of games come out because there's
6934000	6938000	going to be a lot of time coming up to play them.
6938000	6942000	So, with that being said, we have a few releases in Japan this week, and I'm going to start
6942000	6944000	with the Nintendo Switch.
6944000	6950000	On April 27th, Jinkii Infinity in regular and limited edition is out, as well as Temirana
6950000	6961000	koku no tsuru tirohime tsuitenaki shidan, that is a large word, that is out in Japan
6961000	6963000	this week as well on the Switch.
6963000	6970000	Warhammer 40,000 is also out on the Switch in Japan this week, and Evermaiden in a regular
6970000	6972000	and limited edition.
6972000	6978000	My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu Climax in a regular and limited edition.
6978000	6981000	Ys Memoir also out in Japan this week as well.
6981000	6985000	Fortress S also hitting Japan this week.
6985000	6993000	And After Image, the deluxe edition is also out on the Switch in Japan this week, I think
6993000	6997000	in line with the US and other regions as well.
6997000	7003000	Moving over to the PlayStation 5 this week, we have Dredge coming out in Japan, World
7003000	7006000	War Z Aftermath and After Image.
7006000	7011000	Star Wars Jedi Survivor will also get a release in Japan on April the 28th.
7011000	7014000	So, busy week in Japan this week.
7014000	7017000	But then next week, of course, not much.
7017000	7020000	So, over to Europe, Dark Sakura.
7020000	7022000	There's a few.
7022000	7029000	We have on the 25th, we have After Image Deluxe Edition for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.
7029000	7033000	On the 27th, Bramble the Mountain King on the same three.
7033000	7038000	On PlayStation and Xbox, we have The Crown of Wu, Legend Edition, The Restaurant on the
7038000	7039000	28th.
7039000	7042000	We have Star Wars Jedi Survivor for the same two.
7042000	7045000	For PlayStation and Switch, we have Mortal Shell.
7045000	7047000	Also, we have Crazy Chicken Cart 2.
7047000	7054000	For Switch alone, we have Toy Soldiers and Family, sorry, That's My Family, Family Fun
7054000	7057000	Night.
7057000	7058000	That's it.
7058000	7059000	Busy week.
7059000	7062000	All right, let's move on and we have some more headlines for you.
7062000	7066000	And then we'll take your calls, if you want, over on our Discord server.
7066000	7069000	Which, whether you want to call or not, I would encourage you to join and keep in touch
7069000	7072000	with us throughout the week over at vognetwork.com.
7072000	7075000	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7075000	7079000	Before we get into the next story, S. Joe and Hunter Matt commenting on Jedi Survivor
7079000	7086000	saying, I really want Jedi Survivor day one, but that 144 gigabyte install size on Series
7086000	7087000	X.
7087000	7090000	I'm going to need to make some serious cuts to fit it.
7090000	7092000	Yeah, that install sizes.
7092000	7093000	Yikes.
7093000	7094000	That's a lot.
7094000	7095000	That's a lot.
7095000	7100000	Thank God I don't have Comcast bandwidth caps anymore.
7100000	7101000	I'm so thankful for that.
7101000	7105000	Sorry to those that do, but anyway, sorry, Loki.
7105000	7108000	All right, no Jedi Survivor for you.
7108000	7113000	It's only bad when the kids are home for the summer.
7113000	7116000	That's when they start going, you're getting close to your bandwidth caps because they're
7116000	7119000	in there watching stuff, but usually it's fine.
7119000	7120000	Well, that's good.
7120000	7125000	All right, we have some other headlines to talk about for the week, and we'll go over
7125000	7126000	to you, Loki.
7126000	7131000	Yeah, so Stardew Valley is going to be getting an update after quite a while.
7131000	7137000	It's been several years since the updates have been coming out, but now we have version
7137000	7142000	1.6 on its way, and they apparently haven't said too much what's going to be coming to
7142000	7143000	it.
7143000	7146000	Obviously, it's going to be a smaller update than the last one because the last one was
7146000	7148000	kind of a complete rewrite of the game.
7148000	7153000	Now, they said this one's going to be targeted mostly towards changes for modders, which
7153000	7161000	will make it easier and more powerful to mod, but there's going to be additional game content
7161000	7166000	and new dialogue, so we'll just have to wait and see what that is when it finally comes
7166000	7167000	out.
7167000	7169000	You know, people hella mod that game.
7169000	7172000	I was watching somebody on stream, one of my friends playing that game, and it was really
7172000	7177000	modded, so I'm kind of not terribly surprised they've gone back and added some more to it
7177000	7180000	because if they don't, the modders do.
7180000	7188000	But that game's had a very long life, too, so whatever keeps the people interested, right?
7188000	7189000	Yeah.
7189000	7194000	And I mean, especially if he's making it so that there's more tools for the modders to
7194000	7197000	make even more amazing content.
7197000	7203000	So I mean, he probably sees that it's just, it makes sense to try to do that because that's
7203000	7204000	why people buy the game.
7204000	7206000	They're like, oh, man, look at this mod.
7206000	7208000	Buy the game now.
7208000	7210000	So, yeah, of course.
7210000	7215000	All right, let's move over to DarkSakura with some not so great news.
7215000	7220000	Well, I mean, honestly, I don't think this is bad news.
7220000	7222000	Well, it depends how you look at it.
7222000	7223000	Yeah.
7223000	7224000	Yeah.
7225000	7232000	Basically, veteran voice actor James Carter Cathcart is also, is retiring.
7232000	7233000	Congratulations.
7233000	7242000	He was the voice actor behind, I guess, the English ones in Pokemon, Professor Oak, Gary,
7242000	7246000	and James and Meowth is retiring.
7246000	7248000	Well, okay, this is the sad reason.
7248000	7258000	He's retiring after 25 years because he has an advanced form of cancer, but I say good
7258000	7264000	for taking the time to take care for yourself instead of working through it.
7264000	7269000	So he has an advanced form of throat cancer, which, of course, you wouldn't be able to
7269000	7271000	really do much.
7271000	7279000	The cancer is treatable, but it didn't respond to chemotherapy.
7279000	7285000	And so they're going to take a more aggressive round around May 1st.
7285000	7290000	So because of those treatments, he has to retire.
7290000	7310000	And honestly, I think that needing to do this, to take the time to treat himself and not
7310000	7316000	try to push through this, who will try to work while they're in a terminal situation?
7316000	7317000	Oh, sure.
7317000	7325000	I mean, Liz Slaton didn't tell anybody that she was sick until she died, except for the
7325000	7327000	producers on the Sarah Jane adventures.
7327000	7331000	I think about Chadwick Boseman was a huge recent example of that.
7331000	7332000	Yeah.
7332000	7337000	So I'm glad that he's, and on top of that, I'm glad that he's bringing attention to this
7337000	7343000	form of cancer as well, because not everyone thinks of throat and mouth cancer.
7343000	7346000	I mean, I hope he wasn't a smoker or something.
7346000	7357000	But I'm glad that he's doing something for himself and see about getting treated and
7357000	7362000	coming back, I would say coming back to voice acting, but just coming back and living his
7362000	7363000	best life.
7363000	7369000	Did you run my chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, who I know follows all these folks
7369000	7373000	closely because of his own show, Anime Jam Session does clarify he was not a smoker
7373000	7376000	and he was planning on retiring before this.
7376000	7380000	But still, you want that to be completely on your own terms.
7380000	7384000	But I do agree with everything Jamie says about, yeah, you got to put your own health
7384000	7385000	first, for sure.
7385000	7387000	So I'm glad he wasn't a smoker.
7387000	7390000	You know, just thinking about the stuff my mom's gone through.
7390000	7391000	So, yeah.
7391000	7393000	All right.
7393000	7395000	Take care of yourself.
7395000	7398000	I am proud to hear him taking these steps.
7398000	7400000	That's why I say it's not it's not a sad thing.
7400000	7404000	He's doing the right thing he needs to do to take care of himself.
7404000	7405000	All right.
7405000	7408000	Let's go to Loki with something.
7408000	7412000	When I retire, I'm going to play with these all day.
7412000	7418000	Yes, there's more Lego, more video game like that.
7418000	7425000	So it's for Sonic the Hedgehog and there's they're going to be putting out for new sets
7425000	7426000	coming out August 1st.
7426000	7427000	It's funny.
7427000	7429000	They're like video game sets release.
7429000	7431000	And yeah, it's pretty cool.
7431000	7436000	They've got this one set where I don't know they're calling officially, but it's basically
7436000	7441000	you put Sonic inside of like a hamster ball type thing and you smash it down and it goes
7441000	7442000	really fast.
7442000	7445000	You can make go through a loop to loop and over ramps and all that fun stuff.
7445000	7451000	Plus, they have a version of Dr. Robotnik that doesn't look completely stupid like the
7451000	7456000	last Sonic set that they put out because that model was awful.
7456000	7458000	And now it doesn't look awful.
7458000	7459000	So that's good.
7459000	7461000	But there's four sets in total.
7461000	7462000	They have one with Sonic.
7462000	7467000	They have one with Sonic and Tails with his airplane.
7467000	7471000	There's Amy and some sort of animal rescue thing.
7471000	7473000	And then, of course, the.
7473000	7476000	Well, the doctor Robotnik said, I guess, is coming.
7476000	7478000	I don't know if that's part of this main set here.
7478000	7480000	It looks like it may be in the screenshot.
7480000	7481000	Yes.
7481000	7482000	Yes.
7482000	7483000	So that's in the big set.
7483000	7486000	Or you can get a smaller set with just Sonic and not all the additional stuff, because
7486000	7489000	I'm sure it's going to be pretty expensive.
7489000	7491000	But it looks cool.
7491000	7496000	Yeah, Lego sets, they are they do get very expensive, that's for sure.
7496000	7502000	Yes, this year 100 Matt is linking to a Twitter account that shows a leak of some type of
7502000	7504000	Pac-Man Lego set that's coming out.
7504000	7508000	And this looks pretty cool because it looks like it's actually a full little like arcade
7508000	7511000	machine kind of going on in this particular tweet.
7511000	7512000	I guess a leaked image.
7512000	7516000	That's definitely only because I mean, granted, somebody could have photoshopped this, but
7516000	7518000	this would be a bit much to Photoshop.
7518000	7520000	But yeah, that looks really cool, actually.
7520000	7524000	I like that Pac-Man Lego set, if that ends up being legit.
7524000	7525000	But only time will tell.
7525000	7526000	Right.
7526000	7530000	I've seen the links people will go through to fake something.
7530000	7533000	And this this honestly, this is nothing.
7533000	7534000	True.
7534000	7535000	True.
7535000	7536000	Yeah.
7536000	7538000	I guess you can do it.
7538000	7541000	I believe the guy has a track record, though.
7541000	7543000	That's usually more important than anything else is.
7543000	7547000	Yeah, I'm just saying it would be a fairly easy job.
7547000	7548000	Yeah.
7548000	7549000	All right.
7549000	7551000	I'm moving on to one more story tonight.
7551000	7556000	And this is another one of those when Nerd Realms crossover and that would be another
7556000	7557000	leak.
7557000	7563000	This is, again, coming from a proven Fortnite leaker, iFireMonkey, talking about a Doctor
7563000	7568000	Who Fortnite crossover event where you will be able to get skins so you can play as the
7568000	7571000	14th Doctor and the 15th Doctor.
7571000	7576000	If you weren't already aware, the 14th Doctor is extremely similar to the 10th Doctor because
7576000	7577000	of plot reasons.
7577000	7580000	So you but obviously that will all lead in.
7580000	7585000	He's only going to be there for a little bit to all make way for the new 15th Doctor, which
7585000	7588000	will be during the 16th anniversary a little later this year.
7588000	7592000	But it sounds like a partnership with Fortnite will be a part of that.
7592000	7597000	They're talking about a major in-game event and a two-week event with free cosmetic rewards
7597000	7601000	and, of course, additional items available to buy.
7601000	7606000	Let's see, a bunch of more information here.
7606000	7607000	A TARDIS glider.
7607000	7608000	That's amazing.
7608000	7612000	By the way, I haven't talked about this in my game of the week because I only played
7612000	7613000	like once or twice.
7613000	7618000	I finally bought that Ariana Grande skin in Fortnite because they brought it back on Easter.
7618000	7619000	So I played a Fortnite.
7619000	7624000	I played two Fortnites and I got like 89th my first game.
7624000	7625000	But I did better my second game.
7625000	7627000	I was like 50-something my second game.
7627000	7628000	I'm going to make Alan teach me.
7628000	7630000	He's much better at Fortnite than I am.
7630000	7631000	So he's going to teach me.
7631000	7632000	I might play.
7632000	7633000	I would love to.
7633000	7635000	What a fun collab stream.
7635000	7638000	You, me, Alan, and we have to find another Fortnite or sometime to round out a team.
7638000	7639000	That would be fun.
7639000	7646000	So, but yeah, I would love to get a TARDIS glider for Ariana Grande.
7646000	7648000	I can think of nothing that speaks to me more.
7648000	7652000	And there's also going to be an emote that uses the psychic paper from the doctor.
7652000	7658000	Some other free rewards, a time vortex trail, an emote with the sonic screwdriver.
7658000	7660000	So that sounds kind of fun.
7660000	7662000	So yeah, really cool stuff.
7662000	7667000	And of course, with Doctor Who being very big in pop culture leading into this big transition
7667000	7669000	and all that stuff later this year.
7669000	7670000	Good stuff.
7670000	7674000	Also helping on the Fortnite front, just kind of like a side note here, because it's in
7674000	7675000	the realm of Fortnite as well.
7675000	7678000	Epic Games made another acquisition.
7678000	7680000	They've been acquiring a lot of studios.
7680000	7681000	Remember Harmonix?
7681000	7682000	That happened.
7682000	7686000	Well, now Epic Games has acquired Aquarius.
7686000	7688000	I'm not sure if this is the right.
7688000	7689000	Acrius?
7689000	7690000	Acurious?
7690000	7691000	I think it's Acurious.
7691000	7694000	They made, you probably know the game they made better.
7694000	7697000	It's Horizon Chase was the game that they made.
7697000	7702000	It was a very good driving game that they gave away, I think during a PlayStation Plus
7702000	7703000	month or something like that.
7703000	7710000	They are based out of Brazil, and that's going to make Epic Games' first Latin American presence,
7710000	7711000	Epic Games Brazil.
7711000	7712000	So that's pretty cool.
7712000	7714000	And they'll be working on Fortnite.
7714000	7719000	So I don't know if maybe that's working to maybe bring Brazilian pop culture stuff into
7719000	7723000	the game, because I don't know how Doctor Who and some of the other things resonate
7723000	7724000	in Brazil.
7724000	7728000	There's probably some things that would be a little more localized, or maybe there'll
7728000	7731000	be some really cool racing stuff in Fortnite in the future.
7731000	7732000	Who knows?
7733000	7738000	In a statement, the executive vice president of game development at Epic, Alain Tascan,
7738000	7742000	said, we've seen firsthand the impressive talents of the Acrius team in creating innovative
7742000	7746000	games that draw global appeal, and we're excited to welcome them to Epic Games.
7746000	7750000	With the creation of Epic Games Brazil, we look forward to tapping into the immense talent
7750000	7755000	the region has to offer and establishing our presence in Latin America.
7755000	7760000	Their last studio acquisition, by the way, was the prior mentioned harmonics acquisition
7760000	7761000	I mentioned.
7761000	7764000	So there it is.
7764000	7768000	And with that, that is all these scheduled stories we had for tonight.
7768000	7774000	So I do want to open up our phones if anybody wants to call in over at vognetwork.com slash
7774000	7775000	Discord.
7775000	7777000	I'll go to Loki in a minute to see if there's any last minute stories.
7777000	7782000	I do want to do a check in with the mailbag, but it's been a dry spell there for a little
7782000	7783000	bit.
7783000	7784000	I'm starting to wonder.
7784000	7786000	It's still pretty dry.
7786000	7789000	You know, this does make the question, you know, this isn't the first time I've asked
7789000	7794000	this on the show, but I'm very curious about maybe new ways you all want to interact with
7794000	7795000	us.
7795000	7797000	I'm not saying you need to do the homework for us.
7797000	7801000	You know, I've got my eyes and my ears open to what is out there, as I'm sure we all do,
7801000	7807000	but I'm kind of with email clearly drying up a little bit, calls on Discord, you know,
7807000	7810000	and this isn't, you know, it's just been for a couple months.
7810000	7811000	We maybe have had one or two.
7811000	7816000	I'm kind of curious the way you all would like to interact with our program moving forward
7816000	7817000	in the future.
7817000	7818000	You know, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7819000	7821000	We're trying to get more voices out there to join us.
7821000	7824000	So, if you have thoughts, I'd love to hear them.
7824000	7829000	You can tweet me, I guess, at, I mean, I like Mastodon more, but I do check Twitter, over
7829000	7832000	at Mr. Rob Roberts on Twitter, if you want to get my attention.
7832000	7833000	You can, you know what?
7833000	7837000	You can send me a personal email, rob at vognetwork.com.
7837000	7842000	You can also email the show, of course, every week, participate at orangesontrated.com,
7842000	7845000	but I'm really curious about your thoughts.
7845000	7850000	Orange Right is suggesting maybe we need a Discord thread with the Discordedon Question
7850000	7853000	of the Week.
7853000	7856000	I'm open to that, a Discord thing, maybe, if people will use it.
7856000	7858000	We just call it the social inquiry.
7858000	7860000	Yeah, the social inquiry.
7860000	7861000	I like that.
7861000	7866000	So, I take it that, you know, there was a segment on the show years ago called the FUGL
7866000	7867000	Question of the Week.
7867000	7868000	It was Facebook and Google Plus.
7868000	7871000	That will help you understand the age of that.
7871000	7873000	Maybe we need to bring something like that back.
7873000	7874000	I don't know.
7874000	7876000	So, we'll see.
7876000	7881000	I'm cool with that, but we have to call it our social inquiry.
7881000	7884000	No one expects the social inquisition?
7884000	7885000	Exactly.
7885000	7886000	All right.
7886000	7887000	All right.
7887000	7892000	Well, let me go over to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.
7892000	7893000	I don't know.
7893000	7895000	I think we hit on most of it, but sometimes I miss things.
7895000	7896000	Not a lot.
7896000	7902000	Just, you know, because of some recent changes to certain social media platforms, Twitter.
7902000	7903000	Oh, yeah.
7903000	7913000	The Xbox option to share content via Twitter has been disabled because the API now costs
7913000	7918000	$42,000 a month to use, and they're probably not having too many people that actually use
7918000	7919000	that.
7919000	7920000	I used it.
7920000	7928000	I've posted several screenshots for No Man's Sky, but that was the BB or BE times, the
7929000	7934000	time before that guy that I posted a lot of stuff to my Twitter from the Xbox, like No
7934000	7935000	Man's Sky and stuff.
7935000	7939000	I used it a lot, but I'm going to put it this way.
7939000	7945000	I'm more happy with Microsoft doing this than I am sad about the lost feature.
7945000	7946000	So, there's that.
7946000	7951000	And actually the $42,000 was for a small enterprise, so Microsoft probably would have to pay a
7951000	7952000	lot more for that.
7952000	7954000	But yeah, it's not worth it at this point.
7954000	7955000	Yeah.
7955000	7957000	And it's actually very easy, and I've done this too.
7958000	7961000	When you get the share, you can actually go into your Xbox app.
7961000	7966000	And by the way, this is the same thing with PlayStation, but you have to enable it in
7966000	7967000	the PlayStation app.
7967000	7970000	So, if you've never done it, and I think it's only PS5.
7970000	7977000	So, if you have a PS5, I would really encourage you in your PlayStation app, assuming you
7977000	7981000	have the bandwidth and all that stuff to handle it, but more people can benefit from this
7981000	7982000	than not.
7982000	7988000	Turn that on where it syncs your screenshots and videos and stuff to the app, because it
7988000	7990000	makes it really easy to post.
7990000	7995000	But then my point was, in going to the Xbox app, you can actually go, and I just brought
7995000	7997000	mine up for funsies.
7997000	7998000	I don't even, which one is this?
7998000	7999000	Oh, it's Vampire Survivors.
7999000	8004000	So, you can even see, like in my app here, here's all my recent Xbox game captures.
8004000	8010000	In fact, let's go to this one, because this was me on the top of the leaderboard when
8010000	8013000	Falling Plus by our pal YYR first came out.
8013000	8015000	So, I have that, and it's very easy.
8015000	8018000	All you have to do, you can hit, there's a little share button at the bottom, and then
8018000	8025000	you can share to your, you save it as a photo, and then you can post it on Twitter.
8025000	8026000	It's very easy.
8026000	8027000	It's just an extra step.
8027000	8033000	But again, I'm happier Microsoft put their foot down than I am sad that they lost the
8033000	8034000	feature.
8034000	8035000	So, yeah.
8035000	8036000	Yeah.
8036000	8039000	Dartusia says, I guess I have to reinstall Twitter on my phone.
8039000	8040000	No, you don't.
8040000	8044000	No, no, you don't, because I don't have Twitter on my phone.
8044000	8045000	I will put the app back on there.
8045000	8050000	So, you save it as a photo, and then you can upload it just like you would anything else
8050000	8055000	to any social media platform, just in the web browser, in Google, or whatever it is.
8055000	8057000	So, there is that.
8057000	8061000	Yeah, and She-Hulk says, it's great to share and post your gaming moments.
8061000	8062000	Oh, yeah.
8062000	8065000	The way the apps integrate with the newer consoles is great.
8065000	8069000	And I will point out, Xbox has the advantage here, because the PlayStation app deletes
8069000	8070000	it after 14 days.
8070000	8074000	That screenshot I just showed you is months old in the Xbox app.
8074000	8076000	So, there is something to say about that.
8076000	8078000	Bobby, I do see we have a call in the green room.
8078000	8079000	I want to get to that.
8079000	8083000	But Bobby Blackwell points out Sony and Nintendo's uploads to Twitter are still working.
8083000	8089000	So, no word yet if they are still paying the fee, or if it just hasn't hit them yet,
8089000	8091000	or what's going on with that.
8091000	8094000	So, we'll see how much longer those features are still there.
8094000	8096000	So, all right.
8096000	8099000	If that's all with that, then let's actually get to a call.
8099000	8100000	We'd love a call here.
8100000	8102000	I hope I didn't guilt anyone to call again, but we'll see.
8102000	8103000	Hi, you're on origin sounds radio.
8103000	8104000	Who's this?
8104000	8106000	Hello, this is AJ Twist.
8106000	8107000	Can you hear me all right?
8107000	8108000	Yeah, we can hear you fine.
8108000	8109000	You sound great, actually.
8109000	8111000	Nice and crystal clear.
8111000	8112000	It's great to hear from you.
8112000	8113000	How are you?
8113000	8115000	Doing pretty good.
8115000	8116000	Yeah.
8116000	8117000	I'm busy.
8117000	8120000	I have a question I'm dying to ask you, but I want to know what you called in about first.
8121000	8123000	I want to talk about Evo.
8123000	8125000	Okay, this is going to be on the same page.
8125000	8126000	So, let's talk about Evo.
8126000	8128000	What do you want to talk about with Evo?
8128000	8130000	I want to know your question first.
8130000	8131000	Okay.
8131000	8132000	No, it's standoff now.
8132000	8133000	You first.
8133000	8134000	No, you first.
8134000	8135000	You first.
8135000	8136000	Okay, here's my question.
8136000	8140000	Last time you called, or maybe it was the time before, you talked about Nintendo shutting
8140000	8145000	down the Smash Brothers tournament stuff and the whole mess that the panda and all that
8145000	8146000	created.
8146000	8149000	And I remembered you had your weekly tournaments that you did with friends, and I thought that
8149000	8150000	was really cool and all that.
8150000	8157000	So, my question was, Nintendo recently announced a live event in Seattle, and they mentioned
8157000	8160000	that tournaments were going to be a part of that event.
8160000	8166000	So, I was kind of curious, like, do you care?
8166000	8168000	I haven't even looked to see.
8168000	8171000	I heard Nintendo announced something, but I haven't even bothered to go look to see
8171000	8174000	what it was yet.
8174000	8175000	I'm interested.
8175000	8177000	I want to see what they're going to do.
8177000	8183000	I want to know who's really running it, because I know Nintendo's done like a small tournament
8183000	8184000	before.
8184000	8189000	I think it might have even been at E3 or something like that a few years ago when I think either
8189000	8196000	Brawl first came out, or maybe it was Smash 4 for Wii or for 3DS.
8196000	8197000	One of those.
8197000	8198000	E3?
8198000	8200000	Bitch, she died.
8200000	8203000	For reals, right?
8204000	8210000	Even that tournament they held, I think it was more of an invitational, and they just run things differently
8210000	8214000	than how a grassroots tournament would have ran it.
8214000	8219000	I know there's a whole controversy, too, with items being on and certain stages being banned,
8219000	8223000	and I'm pretty sure they probably just ran everything open.
8223000	8224000	Stuff like that.
8224000	8228000	That's what I'm really concerned about as far as how Nintendo would run an actual tournament.
8228000	8234000	Would they follow the rules that the competitive grassroots Smash scene follows, or would they
8234000	8236000	do their own thing?
8236000	8238000	I'll look into that later, because I heard about that.
8238000	8240000	I was interested in what they're planning.
8240000	8245000	Yeah, because that would lead into a question about, especially since we've talked about
8245000	8250000	burning bridges, and your PR needs CPR earlier in the show, and I was just curious, with
8250000	8255000	all the negativity that Nintendo trying to do there, I was curious, are they going to
8255000	8259000	get some goodwill back by finally showing what they're doing for their own tournaments?
8259000	8261000	I guess it's too early to tell.
8261000	8264000	We need to see the tournament first, and that makes sense.
8264000	8265000	Yeah, exactly.
8265000	8267000	See how they're going to hold it.
8267000	8268000	Is it going to be open?
8268000	8269000	Is it invitational?
8269000	8270000	Stuff like that.
8270000	8271000	All right.
8271000	8273000	Let's talk about EVO, then.
8273000	8276000	Yeah, EVO.
8276000	8279000	Like I said last time, I've been there a lot.
8279000	8284000	I've been there, I think, 10 or 11 times by now, over the past, I don't know, 15 years
8284000	8286000	or so.
8286000	8291000	I just want to share my experience, because last year was amazing.
8291000	8297000	Everyone was kind of worried about Sony, because Sony bought EVO, so they're like, you know,
8297000	8298000	they own it now.
8298000	8302000	But they're still letting the people who started it run it, though, which is really good.
8302000	8305000	They haven't stepped in too much to change anything, really.
8305000	8311000	But I guess Sony's more of a, I don't know what you would call it, a sugar daddy, right,
8311000	8315000	to get all the money, giving all the money to EVO so we can use it to spend it for whatever
8315000	8316000	we got to do.
8316000	8322000	So last year, going to EVO, it was the first year that we've been back in person, I believe,
8322000	8325000	and it was the first thing that we got to see what Sony was going to do with it.
8325000	8326000	And it was great.
8326000	8332000	It was like a big convention, a huge, huge hall, a lot of stations.
8332000	8336000	When you play, tournaments go over like about three days, a whole three-day time.
8336000	8341000	But the first two days is really when they do all, everybody playing their matches.
8341000	8347000	So there is 100 stations with like four monitors each so they can run the tournaments quickly.
8347000	8351000	And then they have like a handful of stages for each game.
8351000	8355000	So any big matches that were coming up with some of the top players that they were playing,
8355000	8360000	you know, they'll be able to play on the stage and everyone could crowd around and watch their matches.
8360000	8364000	I guess you can imagine it like as Coachella, you know, you have random stages and it's
8364000	8366000	like, oh, this person is going to be playing this game over here.
8366000	8367000	Let's run over there.
8367000	8370000	Which Sony's been to Coachella, actually.
8370000	8372000	Yeah, they brought their trucks there one year.
8372000	8374000	I don't remember if it was the year, I think it was the year I went.
8374000	8379000	I went, okay, I went to Coachella, no shit, 20 years ago.
8379000	8386000	We went to go see Bjork and the Chemical Brothers and Susie and the Banshees reunion were headlining
8386000	8387000	and it was a great show.
8387000	8391000	But I remember Sony trucks were there showing off like the PS2.
8391000	8392000	Wow, it's amazing.
8392000	8394000	How long has Coachella been going on?
8394000	8395000	Oh, forever.
8395000	8396000	Forever.
8396000	8397000	Wow.
8397000	8405000	But yeah, so Evo, not only is that part really great about it last year, but that was only half of the whole convention hall.
8405000	8407000	Maybe even just one third of it.
8407000	8412000	I would say the other one third of it was all like artist alley stuff.
8412000	8416000	A lot of vendors there selling great art, random just products and stuff like that.
8416000	8424000	And it's Evo, so a lot of stuff is fighting game related, which you don't really see too often in other places except for maybe like Street Fighter stuff.
8424000	8432000	But being able to see Guilty Gear stuff, Tekken stuff, even Guilty Gear, that was all really cool.
8432000	8440000	And then the other third of it was another smaller tournament called Vortex and they just hold whatever game they want to hold and see who signs up.
8440000	8443000	And it's their own just side tournament separate from Evo.
8443000	8444000	And that was another section.
8444000	8450000	And they also had like Red Bull set up over there too. Red Bull's doing their own mini tournament too with random games.
8450000	8457000	And there's a couple of other indie developers too showing off games that they had working on and stuff like that.
8457000	8460000	So it really sounds like just a whole little fighting game convention.
8460000	8461000	Basically, yeah.
8461000	8463000	Or versus game at least, certainly.
8463000	8464000	Yeah.
8464000	8467000	And then the bigger part of it too that I love was the arcade.
8467000	8471000	They just had free play arcade machines there, a lot of them fighting games.
8472000	8474000	I think they had like DDR going on over there too.
8474000	8476000	A couple of music games.
8476000	8480000	And like Ninja Turtles was there too. A couple of those beat-em-up games were there too.
8480000	8482000	And it was all just free play.
8482000	8484000	So anyone could just show up and start playing a game.
8484000	8485000	So that was awesome.
8485000	8489000	And one of my memorable moments there with the arcade was playing Super Puzzle Fighter.
8489000	8493000	I saw a machine there and I saw some random lady there.
8493000	8496000	I think she was from Japan because she wasn't speaking really good English for me.
8496000	8497000	We were just trying to communicate.
8497000	8500000	But we were playing against each other and she was just kicking my ass.
8500000	8505000	And then a little crowd showed up and I was like, all right, whoever's up next, you can take over.
8505000	8507000	And then someone else took over and then more people started playing.
8507000	8509000	So it was just like an old arcade vibe.
8509000	8510000	There were people just challenging.
8510000	8513000	But over Puzzle Fighter though, which was amazing.
8513000	8519000	I even left for a little bit and I came back and one of those people was still there.
8519000	8521000	And I was like, oh, let me get another game in.
8521000	8523000	And still got my ass kicked.
8523000	8529000	And then after she was done playing, the first lady that I started off with came back.
8529000	8531000	And she was like, oh, can I play you again?
8531000	8533000	I was like, yeah, let's go again.
8533000	8535000	So it was a good time, great time there.
8535000	8541000	That's great, especially probably being the first big event for you in that community since COVID lockdowns.
8541000	8545000	It just kind of, absence makes the heart grow fonder, that type of thing, right?
8545000	8546000	Yeah.
8546000	8548000	That was great.
8548000	8551000	Before I let you go, I thought of another question for you that's very timely.
8551000	8555000	Since you are a fighting game fan and you've called in a lot to talk about that.
8555000	8559000	Currently, you have an opinion on all the Street Fighter 6 news this week?
8559000	8562000	Not yet. I know the demos released.
8562000	8566000	I don't own any consoles except for Switch.
8566000	8569000	So I'm waiting for a PC demo to release and I heard that will be next week.
8569000	8571000	Fair. It's next week, yeah.
8571000	8574000	Yeah. And I don't think there's, I don't think there's online I heard.
8574000	8576000	I think there's no versus right now.
8576000	8578000	I think it's only that open world.
8578000	8581000	It's the open world. I think the arcade mode is really limited.
8581000	8584000	I have to admit, I haven't even touched it, but I think there's like two characters available.
8584000	8588000	Probably Luke or whoever the new guy is on the cover.
8588000	8593000	He's certainly one of them because that's who influences all the moves on your characters.
8593000	8595000	And then probably one other.
8595000	8597000	Oh, Luke and Ryu is all that's new.
8597000	8599000	Yeah, I think I saw a post about that earlier. That's right.
8599000	8600000	Yeah.
8600000	8606000	Yeah, if it comes out for Steam next week and there's a few more characters, then I'm interested.
8606000	8609000	Because I'm not really interested in playing Luke or Ryu right now.
8609000	8610000	Fair.
8610000	8613000	I'm waiting to try out, I think her name is Lily.
8613000	8616000	Well, they can't give it all to you or you're not going to buy it.
8616000	8618000	No.
8618000	8620000	But yeah, I think I'll buy it anyways.
8620000	8623000	Yeah, it's June's a big month.
8623000	8628000	Like, it is very strange that when I think of June in games, I'm not thinking of Street Fighter VI first.
8628000	8630000	Because honestly, any other year I would be.
8630000	8636000	But this year between Diablo and Final Fantasy, I'm like, that's my bread and butter right there.
8636000	8646000	I almost, just a little bit, almost, maybe, depending on how the acquisition news goes, almost want to do BlizzCon this year.
8646000	8649000	I don't think I will, ultimately, because I just think there's higher priority things on my plate.
8649000	8653000	But like, what can I say? I love Diablo.
8653000	8657000	Yeah, and I'm also excited for Diablo II.
8657000	8660000	June's going to be kind of busy between Street Fighter.
8660000	8663000	I'm going to enter for Street Fighter VI at EVO.
8663000	8665000	I already signed up for that.
8665000	8669000	And also Tekken 7, since Tekken 8 isn't out yet.
8669000	8674000	And then I'm waiting for word of side tournaments happening so I can enter for Soul Calibur VI again as well.
8674000	8676000	So that's what I'm looking forward to.
8676000	8678000	And EVO's all in Vegas, right?
8678000	8680000	All Las Vegas, yeah.
8680000	8685000	Vegas is not that far. I need to go one of these years, honestly.
8685000	8687000	So, one of these years, I'll get out there.
8687000	8690000	I'm not usually, like, when I think about the games I enjoy, I don't dislike fighting games.
8690000	8692000	Certainly. I mean, I'll buy Street Fighter VI. I'm positive.
8692000	8697000	But I just don't follow them as closely as other types of games.
8697000	8699000	I feel like, oh, EVO's not for me because it's super competitive.
8699000	8704000	But the way you describe it, where it's like, nah, it's just like a big convention of people who like these types of games.
8704000	8706000	And I love the chill arcade vibe.
8706000	8709000	I love, that's my favorite part of conventions.
8709000	8713000	That's what I loved about MAGFest. That's what I love about California Extreme.
8713000	8716000	That's why I want to go to Southern Fry Game Expo one of these days.
8716000	8719000	Just those big open arcade, Dragon Con shit.
8719000	8723000	I spend most of my con there, too. So, it's a lot of fun. I love that.
8723000	8725000	Yeah, it is. And it's also even more fun.
8725000	8733000	Like, if you, because last year, me and my group of friends all went and we all entered, you know, at least two different tournaments, two different games to play.
8733000	8737000	And I remember our first day, Friday, we had just a full schedule.
8737000	8739000	Like, everybody was playing somewhere.
8739000	8748000	So, every two hours, we were running to like a different area, a different station, you know, for me to play a match or for one of my friends to play a match or, you know, just back and forth all day.
8748000	8754000	And so, that was just fun. Just having something to do like every couple hours, go watch my friend get beat at a couple games.
8754000	8759000	It was fun. So, at the very least, to watch people play is great.
8759000	8769000	Yeah. I'm going to have to make it out there. And it's not like, you know, like I could also do the thing where it's like I dip into EVO one day and then Alan is there and he'll be like, I want to go see a show.
8769000	8773000	Okay, we'll go see a show. Go have a meal. Go eat at Hell's Kitchen or something. Have a Vegas time.
8773000	8777000	Definitely do that. At the very least, like get a one-day pass. Check it out.
8777000	8778000	Exactly.
8778000	8779000	That's awesome.
8779000	8787000	You know, the first time I ever went to TwitchCon was a one-day pass the very first year. That was our voiceover guy, Jason, said, you should go to this. You know, I was like, okay.
8787000	8795000	And he was gracious enough to give me like an extra ticket or something they had. And I went and it actually completely changed my perception on Twitch.
8795000	8796000	That's cool.
8796000	8806000	So I want to try that someday too. Or at the very least, you can also do the finals match where you're just in the huge stadium, big screen and just watching top eight of all the matches.
8806000	8807000	Feeling that buzz.
8807000	8809000	Yeah, I haven't done that yet.
8809000	8813000	Wait, do I get to scream light the beam when they win like we do here?
8813000	8817000	I think so, yeah.
8817000	8822000	Since all the Northern California teams are moving to Vegas, I mean, might as well.
8822000	8824000	All right.
8824000	8825000	Well, there's options.
8825000	8832000	AJ, thank you so much for sharing that and making me want to put room for Evo on my calendar, quite honestly.
8832000	8833000	Take care.
8833000	8834000	Thanks so much for calling.
8834000	8838000	It's always a delight to hear from you and we hope to hear from you again.
8838000	8839000	For sure.
8839000	8840000	All right.
8840000	8841000	Take care, buddy.
8841000	8842000	All right.
8842000	8843000	Always great to hear from folks.
8843000	8849000	And of course, if you want to give us a call, you can join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8849000	8851000	And please feel free to give us a call.
8852000	8855000	But with that, did we have any other last minute stories, Loki?
8855000	8857000	Yeah, there was one thing.
8857000	8863000	So basically that there's that new a golem game that's coming out.
8863000	8871000	They're going to be charging with DLC to add more Elvish into the game.
8871000	8873000	So the characters speak native Elvish.
8873000	8876000	You have to pay money for that.
8876000	8880000	Because, of course, it's Warner Brothers and they're going to charge for everything.
8880000	8883000	Whatever happened to a fucking controller unlock code?
8883000	8884000	Remember that?
8884000	8887000	That doesn't happen anymore.
8887000	8888000	We love a callback.
8888000	8890000	Let me call back to an earlier story.
8890000	8893000	That's what the gamers over 50 really fucking want.
8893000	8896000	What do the gamers over 50 really want?
8896000	8900000	We don't need the representation in games as bad as we need.
8900000	8903000	Keyboard and controller, Chico, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
8903000	8904000	You know the rest.
8904000	8905000	We need those.
8905000	8907000	You know they have to pay the voice actors.
8907000	8909000	Ah, fair.
8909000	8911000	You have to rely.
8911000	8914000	That used to all be inclusive in the budget.
8914000	8917000	The voice actors already recorded their lines in English.
8917000	8923000	And I get it that they taught them to speak in Elvish where they had them record additional lines.
8923000	8928000	But that's just part of the budget of the game then.
8928000	8930000	They're just piece-paling it.
8930000	8934000	If the game's already released and they're making additional content for it, then...
8934000	8935000	It's not out yet.
8935000	8937000	Oh.
8937000	8940000	They're releasing DLC prior to the game coming out.
8940000	8945000	Or they're saying that it's basically pre-order, paid unlock nonsense.
8945000	8948000	It's just...
8948000	8949000	Then don't record it.
8949000	8957000	If it's a thing that's going to cost extra money, you either include it in the budget or you just don't do it.
8957000	8960000	You don't sell it separately.
8960000	8966000	That'd be like saying, oh hey, we have language options in the game, but those are going to cost you.
8966000	8968000	That's dumb.
8968000	8977000	Think of it like when you go to buy a new car and you're adding options to it, I guess.
8977000	8983000	Or if you are having a house built and you want the extra big closets.
8983000	8988000	Well, but think about when you buy a Blu-ray and you can change the language track.
8988000	8991000	So there's also cases for the other, yeah.
8991000	9001000	If you want to go the car equivalent, that's the equivalent of them having seat warmers in their car, but you have to pay a monthly fee to use those seat warmers.
9001000	9003000	That's a fucking thing they do.
9003000	9006000	What is Sirius XM? What is that?
9006000	9009000	There's other things, too, that are more egregious.
9009000	9018000	It's basically because they don't want to ship multiple SKUs, so they're like, ah, we'll just disable it, even though the functionality is already there.
9018000	9020000	It's in the code. It's paid unlock.
9020000	9024000	Capcom used to do that because it's easier for the consumer.
9024000	9032000	I would say it's a matter of time before people start hacking their cars, but I would say that, but that's already happening.
9032000	9035000	Of course it is. Of course it is because of the internet.
9035000	9039000	That's stupid because people don't agree with it, so of course they're being motivated.
9039000	9042000	But then again, that's also a problem for people to buy really expensive cars.
9042000	9044000	Just don't buy those cars then.
9044000	9056000	It's not like something they can patch into it unless you're probably Tesla or something like that, but your normal car that you have now isn't going to all of a sudden one day start demanding money for windshield wipers or something like that.
9056000	9062000	Can you imagine? The deposit quarter to run windshield wipers.
9062000	9064000	You don't drive a Fiat.
9064000	9070000	All right. With that, we're going to wrap up and get on out for the night.
9070000	9074000	Thank you as always though for listening to our show and downloading.
9074000	9076000	We appreciate you all being here.
9076000	9079000	If you enjoyed what you heard, please tell a friend or two about the show.
9079000	9084000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.
9084000	9089000	So a nice five star review on iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way.
9089000	9096000	Speaking of Spotify, they have places where you can leave feedback now, and I'm just saying I did find out how to go read those.
9096000	9099000	So for you Spotify folks, if you want to say hello or whatever.
9099000	9101000	Found out how to read.
9101000	9103000	I learned how to read.
9103000	9112000	I realized, oh, you need to log into the Spotify podcast portal and you can see all that in one convenient place instead of having like, is this episode have one?
9112000	9114000	Does this episode have one?
9114000	9116000	So you can kind of go through and see that.
9116000	9118000	So I will see those.
9118000	9120000	Maybe that's where we need to solicit feedback.
9120000	9122000	I don't know.
9122000	9124000	Because people use all sorts of podcast apps.
9124000	9126000	I don't want to limit it.
9126000	9128000	Spotify cannot have exclusive features unless they pay us.
9128000	9132000	But if you do want to leave feedback, that is one option to do it.
9132000	9134000	I think that's really it.
9134000	9139000	Otherwise, I think we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and wrap it on up and do this again in seven days.
9139000	9142000	So I will go to Dark Sakura.
9142000	9146000	I will not have Gwen or Fixie tonight.
9146000	9148000	I may have Shayla later.
9148000	9154000	So if anybody wants to play some survivor rounds with me, you're welcome and invited.
9154000	9156000	All right.
9157000	9159000	Killer matches. I've been playing killer lately.
9159000	9161000	It's kind of fun.
9161000	9166000	I've got a couple of dailies to do, but they're on characters I've already adapted.
9166000	9169000	I might just do them because, I mean, it's easy.
9169000	9172000	It's like Doctor and Freddy.
9172000	9174000	Oh, Doctor gets the easiest ones.
9174000	9175000	This is so easy.
9175000	9176000	And Freddy, too.
9176000	9178000	I mean, all you have to do is just chase people.
9178000	9179000	Oh, that's easy.
9179000	9180000	Nice.
9180000	9181000	All right.
9181000	9182000	We'll have a good stream, Dark Sakura.
9182000	9183000	We'll talk to you later.
9183000	9185000	Bye.
9185000	9187000	Moving over to Loki and your final thought tonight.
9187000	9189000	I'm just going to be busy again.
9189000	9192000	Busy this week with more Minecraft stuff.
9192000	9193000	It's like a broken record.
9193000	9195000	As always.
9195000	9196000	My final thought.
9196000	9199000	I have a very, very, very busy week at work this week.
9199000	9203000	It's going to be very good that this is like a mountain.
9203000	9208000	I have a big project that is getting its delivery to a big audience this week.
9208000	9212000	I don't love to talk about my day job on places like this, but that's all I'm going to say.
9212000	9214000	So I needed your thoughts and prayers.
9214000	9215000	I need all of that.
9215000	9218000	Whatever it is you've got for me, give it to me.
9218000	9221000	And I do hope to be doing some streaming this week again.
9221000	9224000	Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster is calling my name.
9224000	9228000	So I'll see you guys on stream later this week, for sure.
9228000	9229000	That does it.
9229000	9231000	That does it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.
9231000	9232000	Thank you all for being here.
9232000	9234000	I hope you all have a fantastic week.
9234000	9236000	Happy gaming, whatever it is you're playing.
9236000	9239000	Or if you're just looking forward to June, or probably May,
9239000	9241000	and the release of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
9241000	9243000	Honestly, that's the first one.
9243000	9245000	That's the first crack in the dam.
9245000	9248000	We'll be excited for all that stuff.
9248000	9250000	And I hope you have fun playing whatever it is this week.
9250000	9251000	We'll see you in seven days.
9251000	9252000	Have a great week, everybody.
9252000	9253000	Goodbye.
