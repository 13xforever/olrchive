0	30000	Since the loss of ThinkGeek, there's been a void of great geek April Fools, especially for anything that could be feasibly tangible. Hats off to the Sonic social team for having a dream as completely off the beaten and expected paths as it was, and congratulations on making it happen. The reaction to the murder of Sonic the Hedgehog has been wonderful to see, the commentary has been amazing, and it's always a treat to start April in smiles and fascination rather than not.
30000	58480	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again, with episode number 955 of our show for tonight, April the 9th of 2023.
58640	66560	My name is Rob Roberts and I am joined, as always, by my co host. Say hello first and foremost to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
67280	67600	Jamie Summers Hey.
67680	68800	Hi, how are you doing?
69680	70440	Jamie Summers I'm okay.
70480	70920	Rob Roberts Yeah?
70960	75280	Jamie Summers My- I've been doing new things with my body.
76640	78360	Rob Roberts Now, now this is a family show.
79520	80440	Jamie Summers It's clean.
80600	82480	Rob Roberts Okay, what kinds of things?
82480	96320	Jamie Summers Well, I've gotten back, I can now lift some weights again. I do yoga practically every day now. And I'm starting basic ballet.
96840	100480	Rob Roberts Oh, wow. Okay. It's very artistic. I love that.
101240	124960	Jamie Summers Well, I have to have a bar and I found some courses that teach online. And now I have mad respect for, for dancers. Just just try to go from a first position demi plié into elevé and do that 20 times.
125960	129280	Rob Roberts Will I be seeing you in next year's production of The Nutcracker?
130200	135720	Jamie Summers No. But apparently, Queer Jesus just followed me. So I'm following them back.
136400	137720	Rob Roberts Well, it's a good day for that.
138680	158360	Jamie Summers But at any rate, it's, it's all this attempt I'm doing to try to get the range of motion back in my in my hips since I have arthritis. And I'm doing so much stuff now that now my back actually starts hurting if I don't maintain good posture.
158360	170560	Jamie Summers So, um, but I'm, I'm, I'm trying to get myself stronger, get myself geared up. And of course, there's all the prep work for the event on my birthday.
170560	174120	Rob Roberts Getting old is fun. Is the lesson learned there?
175000	177920	Jamie Summers No, it's not old. Older.
178120	179680	Rob Roberts Old. Okay, yes. Older.
179680	186720	Jamie Summers We're older every day. Old is not. It doesn't mean anything.
186720	188520	Rob Roberts I'm older now than I was when the show started.
188520	200360	Jamie Summers Everyone is. But old doesn't mean anything anymore. It's, it's a state of being and not a number on the calendar.
201200	208800	Rob Roberts All right. Well, also say hello to somebody. I don't know if he's going to be signing up for ballerina classes anytime soon. But you never know. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
209400	210880	No, I will not be doing that.
210880	214800	Jamie Summers You know what, you don't need to improve your posture. Like I, I think I do.
214880	221720	Rob Roberts No, I absolutely do. But that will be not that that's not the method I'll be using to improve my posture.
221720	226320	Jamie Summers You could start by actually playing that Dance Dance Revolution machine in your garage.
226680	239320	Rob Roberts You know, actually, funny. Yeah. Funny you mentioned that. Yeah, I should do that. I earlier this week, I was like, man, I need to go out there and like, just hook everything back up again, because it's broken PC.
239320	250640	Jamie Summers I don't know if you went outside today, but it's like, oh, shit. Summer just showed up all of a sudden. It's not that bad. But I was like, I did. Yeah, we had our week long transition. Spring happened and now it's summer. So yeah.
251840	267720	Jamie Summers sj100matt in our chat because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network. Nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show. sj100matt in chat says I mean, DDR does have a bar. So
268720	273720	Jamie Summers it's a difference between a bar and a bar. There is B a r r e.
275440	292200	Jamie Summers And for the record, I'm not planning on going out and actually being a dancer. I just want to learn the techniques and, and have the benefit of it. I'm not an in person performer performer unless it's like musical instruments or whatever.
292200	301320	Jamie Summers And it's not for everybody. It just happened to be the thing that has really done wonders for my mobility.
301320	321840	Jamie Tworkowski There's, there's, you're not going to appreciate this comparison. I'm sorry, but it's the first thing that comes to mind. But I'm very familiar with a lot of ladies and guys too and theys that have done pole dancing classes for very similar reasons. It's not that they ever really intend to use it. But it's that same type of, you know, yeah.
321840	347160	Jamie Tworkowski In comparison, I actually found video of ballerina pole dancers. By training usually a ballerina is going to have stronger legs than upper body. And a pole dancer is going to have a stronger upper body. So put the two together and you're seeing musculature that belongs on She-Hulk doing things on a pole I never thought were possible.
347160	364080	Jamie Tworkowski For my birthday once, a friend, well, sadly, a former friend, but still at the time, it was very nice gesture, did a free like comp pole dancing class for me and a few friends. And I remember Extafur was there as well.
364920	375040	Jamie Tworkowski Yeah, it was, you know, like I said, it was a different time. But at the time, we had a great time and Extafur was very good at pole dancing as it turns out.
376040	382280	Brandon Zemp You answered your question, Darksack, right? Yes, there was a pole dance hero. It was an adult swimming web game.
382800	386520	Jamie Tworkowski Oh shit. Why have I not played this?
387120	398520	And DJ Rama S in our chat says there is a pole dancing anime coming out later this year called Pole Princess. Well, I guess the name Pole Position was taken.
399200	405200	Brandon Zemp Yeah, I was gonna say I want to see the anime with pole dancing, you know, race cars, pole position. Hell yes.
405200	430160	All right, sorry to take your joke. All right, let's get into tonight's kickoff topic, which is about something admittedly I have yet to see. But the reality is a lot of you have seen it. And I mean, a lot of you have seen it. And it is the Super Mario Brothers movie, which, of course, was released into theaters this weekend. I did not get around to seeing it this weekend. I don't think, Darksack, I don't think you did. I remember
430240	433920	I have not. Yeah, I'm actually considering going to see on like a Tuesday mat.
434240	436960	That's where I'm at. I kind of like I'll find a weeknight I can go.
438000	440120	Yeah, but I still have other stuff I'd rather see.
440200	441680	Loki, you did see it.
442720	446760	I mean, honestly, like if you're gonna go to the movie. Yeah, it was it was good.
446800	449320	You want to see it again? You want to see it again? That's what you're gonna say, huh?
449680	450320	No, no, no, no.
450320	454440	So so I was actually I was talking about this earlier to my sister, so
455360	458760	they were talking about like the Dungeons and Dragons movie and Mario.
458760	460920	And I was like, if someone asked me, hey.
462120	465400	Let's go see one of those two movies again this week or something like that.
465720	467440	I picked the Dungeons and Dragons movie.
467440	472440	OK, that's not to say that the the Super Mario movie wasn't good.
472440	474640	It was good. I liked it.
474640	477040	I think it's kind of just your run of the mill, like.
478040	481240	Illumination movie, I guess it's not bad.
481240	483920	It's just not like it wasn't hilarious.
483920	485520	It wasn't like super funny or anything.
485520	488240	It was just it was satisfying.
488240	489200	It was satisfying to watch.
489200	492080	Is it something I need to see like right away again?
492760	495320	I mean, maybe if I want to pick up like on some of the background
495320	498200	like Easter eggs and stuff like that a little bit more than what I did.
500320	501680	But Dungeons and Dragons was funny,
501680	504400	like I actually laughed out loud at a bunch of stuff in that.
504400	505760	That's a great movie.
506520	507800	Like that, I would see again,
507800	509760	and I'm very excited to see what they do with that humor.
509760	511680	But like, honestly, both are good.
511680	514840	I'm sure a lot of your gaming podcasts that you all listen to out there
514840	517840	are going to be talking a little bit in depth about their impressions
517840	520120	or reviews of the movie, and that's great.
520120	523160	So I suppose I should allow Loki a little bit of space
523160	525680	without spoiling anything, obviously, because not only have you
525680	529040	and Dark Soccer and I not seen it, but I'm sure there's people listening in chat.
529280	532880	So obviously gags, specifics in the gags aside,
533080	535680	what were kind of just, I guess, your general thoughts on the movie?
535680	536960	I mean, you kind of started to go there.
536960	540520	You talk about that it was satisfying, but like, you know,
541440	543720	were you kind of did you see like opportunities
543720	546000	they needed to take advantage of that weren't there? Was it?
546600	549160	Yeah, the opportunity they should have taken advantage of.
549160	551320	Don't show the whole movie in your trailers.
551720	555360	That's number one, because there's a lot of stuff that would have been
555360	558120	more impactful had they not shown it in their trailers.
558320	559680	And yeah, I was excited about the movie.
559680	562400	So I watched the trailers and the TV spots and all that stuff.
562440	565160	But they showed a lot of the movie,
565160	567920	like a lot of the big stuff that was in there. Yeah.
568360	570760	So there wasn't like any surprises, kind of.
570760	575120	And I think that's what kind of made it not as good as it could have been,
575120	579920	is because, you know, all of that surprise was kind of thrown out the window.
581160	585280	You know, generally, I mean, plot wise, funny,
585280	588640	you know, it sort of kind of reminds me a little bit of the the 90s
588640	592120	Mario movie in a sense, like there's a part at the end
592120	596600	that is like what what they were trying to do in the 90s movie.
596600	598720	But then they actually did it in this one. But then
600800	603400	I don't know, like there's a lot of like
603400	607520	Easter egg stuff in there, like obviously, you know, the DK rap,
607520	609840	like the Mario Brothers,
611320	615120	you know, TV show theme, which you saw in the commercial again.
615120	619920	Once again, there's all that stuff and there are lots of music things.
620920	625920	Rob was right again about, you know, who Charles Martinet played, obviously.
625920	628960	I won't remind you, but go check the tapes on that episode.
628960	630760	I told you exactly what his role would be.
630760	634320	And it turns out, just add that to the scoreboard.
634320	636360	Yeah, I heard he actually has two characters, but.
637880	639720	But yeah, it still was.
639720	641680	Yeah, I mean, so it made sense.
643640	646040	I mean, I don't know, I think it was pretty good.
646040	648680	It's just it's one of the things, though, it's like, I'm
649640	652640	am I like super pumped for like when the next movie comes out?
652880	653920	Yeah, I'll see it.
653920	656480	I'm not like, you know, really, really excited.
656640	660240	Probably this time would be I would try to avoid the trailers
660240	663560	because apparently illumination, the folks behind that,
663920	667320	they have no self-control when it comes to showing everything from the movies.
667320	671400	So I would just say that going forward, you know, if you want, you know.
671840	675120	That's why in our discord over at vog network dot com slash discord,
675120	677160	you know, Tiger Claw posts a lot of that movie hype.
677240	678120	This is not a read.
678120	679800	I get it.
679800	681880	Everybody gets into movies different ways.
681880	685360	And some people really want to, you know, consume all that and get in the hype.
685360	688080	So when it's something that, you know, I'm going to pick on Tiger Claw
688080	691320	a little bit since I am the Sonic, the Ninja Turtles and that whole
691320	692440	sorts of things that he's into.
692440	694960	He'll post every single little commercial spot that comes up.
695120	697840	And some people do want to see that and like buy into that hype.
697840	700520	And it's almost like you're drip feeding some of that movie.
700720	704000	So I get it. But we did build him essentially his own channel
704160	706800	so that people who don't want to consume all that.
707480	708840	Can stay out, you know what I mean?
708840	711120	So everybody has it.
711120	712360	There's no right or wrong way.
712360	714960	Everybody has their different levels of fandom.
714960	716960	And some some people when it comes to certain movies,
716960	719720	like they don't want to know a goddamn thing about it when they go in there.
719720	721480	And honestly, some movies are better
721480	723640	when you don't know a single thing going into it.
724080	727760	So, you know, it's just I think the writing could have been better
727760	728600	probably in the movie.
728600	731240	Like, it's funny, like because illumination movies, I don't like
731240	734360	see them as a negative thing, even like the movies are fine.
734800	738120	Like, sure, the characters are somewhat annoying, but that's by the
738120	741240	I can't stand the minion stuff, but I get it.
741240	742400	Like I get it. Yeah.
742400	743840	Look at the other stuff like around it.
743840	747400	Like I remember, like, for example, it's a really weird comparison, but like
749000	753440	The Secret Life of Pets, like the beginning of that movie, they play.
753440	756800	I remember at the song school, but it's like New York is the name of the song.
757160	760320	And it's just like shots of like Central Park and stuff like that.
760320	763800	But it's done so stylistically that it's just like really impactful
764080	766760	or like sing sing is another one that they do.
766760	772160	Like, it's a really like impactful moments in in that
773120	776240	those movies this didn't have that.
776240	780800	Like, it's just not like the heart is kind of missing in some of the stuff.
781160	784280	Now to say like Chris Pratt did a fine job.
784280	785680	I am totally fine with that.
785680	788520	In fact, it's funny because now that the movies come out, people are like, Whoa,
788920	791000	that Rogan didn't do a good job.
791000	792000	It's like, who cares?
792040	794840	Like, honestly, none of that detracted from the movie at all.
794840	797200	It's just there's not much plot there.
797200	799240	They hinted at things that.
800280	801800	They didn't address in this movie
801800	804080	that are probably being the next one or something,
804080	807400	but there's just not a lot of plot.
807400	810000	I mean, it's kind of.
810000	812720	I don't know, like it like how
812720	816840	how Mario gets to the Mushroom Kingdom is just kind of throwaway.
817280	820360	Like, I mean, it's about it's about like kind of
821080	823400	it's kind of what the 90s movie did.
823400	825840	Honestly, it's it's very similar.
825840	828560	Yeah. Do the games actually have a real plot?
829440	831240	No, I don't think they do.
831240	833080	And that's the thing.
833080	835720	Bowser's done interesting,
836000	839200	which it makes more sense when you look at like Odyssey and stuff.
839200	841920	It's very similar to that.
843160	846640	There's a lot of like a lot of Easter eggs and like things
846640	850280	from the Mario games and the movies and stuff are not movies,
850280	854400	but like just the games themselves, a lot of stuff taken straight out of that.
854840	858480	The Mario Kart thing just felt really like just out of nowhere.
858480	860160	I mean, it was fine. It was cool.
860160	862600	I mean, it's just I don't know.
863080	866200	I think they could have had better writers is what they they probably needed.
866200	867760	But like, yeah, illumination.
867760	869520	No, it's not bad when I go see the next one.
869520	870920	Absolutely. Day one again.
870920	874400	But like, it's just when you compare it to like Dungeons and Dragons,
874400	876400	which was thoroughly entertaining.
876400	877360	And I don't play a lot.
877360	879160	I played D&D like way back in the day.
879160	882800	But I'm like, not certainly a D&D aficionado or anything like that.
883600	885880	That movie is just very entertaining on its own.
886000	888080	And you have the writers that thank for that.
888560	890960	One question. Do they mention THAC0 at all?
892560	894200	I don't think so.
894200	895880	Darn. Maybe in the sequel.
895880	897080	All right, well, speak of his sequel.
897080	901680	So even though Loki gave a, you know, kind of a is all right type of review there.
901880	905560	And I'm kind of where I'm like, OK, I'm assuming
905560	909520	it's not going to be the most amazing Oscar winning plot here.
909720	912600	But as long as there's lots of Easter eggs and things that made me go,
913080	915880	I get that, like, which it sounds like there's a lot.
915960	917040	There's a lot of music.
917040	918800	I'll be fine. Yeah.
918800	920400	So lots of music stuff that's in there.
920400	923560	That's like because it's all the orchestra takes on those.
923560	925120	And it's like, oh, yeah.
925120	928000	Oh, so then like so much nostalgia stuff.
928360	930120	Like it's good in that sense.
930120	933080	And like I like I said, I don't want to say like I didn't enjoy it.
933080	934720	Like I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
934720	937240	It's just not like one of those movies, like,
937240	939960	you know, Tron Legacy, where it's like, oh, man, I got to go.
940160	941720	I got to watch. Yeah, yeah.
941720	945280	Right now, that type of thing in IMAX.
945280	946920	I know it's not like that.
946920	950360	I don't really want to go to Florida, but if I'm going to go to Florida,
950360	953040	I guess I'll get my money to Disney and go ride that new Tron ride
953040	954640	because I really want to.
954640	956520	Let's just put it that way.
956520	961920	One of the hosts of a podcast I'm really fond of stuff you missed in history
962920	967040	got to go on it early and said that it was every bit as amazing
967040	968160	as one thinks it is.
968160	969880	I heard a lot of the electronica stuff
969880	971840	moved over there, too, that they they had it.
971840	973440	But anyway, that's another topic.
973440	975200	I want to go back to the Mario movie.
975200	979400	And even though across the board from critics getting kind of mad reviews,
979800	982520	that doesn't matter what matters box office.
982520	985320	And let's take a look at a report from Variety.
985320	989440	OK, so Variety is like a Hollywood industry type of magazine, right?
989440	990960	And Variety is talking
990960	994600	Super Mario Brothers movie barrels to a record two hundred
994600	997280	and four million debut.
997280	999680	And it talks about that the movie made two hundred
999680	1002600	and four point six million in its first five days of release.
1002840	1005680	Some of you may be looking at a different number that's three hundred million.
1005680	1007800	You're looking at global versus US.
1007800	1010920	This is still a huge number for the US, that is for sure.
1011440	1014160	This is now the biggest opening weekend of the year.
1014360	1017920	Ant-Man and the Wasp was the prior record holder with about half
1017920	1019600	that one hundred and six million.
1019600	1024560	It is the second biggest debut ever for an animated title.
1025520	1028880	It outgrows Finding Dory from 2016,
1029400	1031600	at least for opening weekend, as far as it goes.
1032280	1033880	We go on to talk about another one hundred
1033880	1036080	seventy three million from the International Box Office.
1036360	1038920	Three hundred and seventy seven million worldwide.
1039160	1042000	That's off of a one hundred million dollar production budget.
1042960	1047360	It was expected to collect eighty six million over the weekend.
1047520	1050440	And one hundred and twenty five in its first five days of release.
1050680	1055280	So this is a better than expected turnout for this movie.
1055600	1059320	And I got to say, I think this is this is going to be huge
1059520	1061560	for our video games going to movies.
1061720	1065360	And just like we were already going this direction, right?
1065360	1069440	You know, video games have been slowly taking over media,
1070200	1073320	you know, especially ever since The Witcher did very well on Netflix,
1073320	1075320	which, yes, I know is a book, but come on.
1075600	1079440	It was the video games that, you know, was was really pushing that and so forth.
1079680	1081720	And then, you know, you had the Castlevania anime.
1081720	1084360	And then, you know, then you had all this stuff that happened
1085640	1089080	on the Netflix side of things and all the streaming services.
1089320	1092360	And then Resident Evil, they have the Resident Evil series.
1092520	1095360	Well, it didn't go too well because it's canceled.
1095360	1098240	No, I'm not talking about the live action anime. Yeah.
1098760	1101400	Yeah, I really liked Degeneration.
1101600	1103840	Resident Evil Degeneration was such a good watch.
1103840	1106000	Yeah, the live action, yeah.
1106000	1108240	But and it had
1108240	1110760	Anatsuchia on the soundtrack, so that was great.
1111120	1115640	But now, as far as, you know, 2023 goes,
1115640	1119760	you've got that one, two punch of The Last of Us on HBO.
1119760	1124000	Obviously, a very different kind of thing than Super Mario Brothers.
1124000	1125880	But this is this is huge.
1125880	1130320	Like you're going to see a ton of video game stuff get green lit real soon.
1130840	1132840	A sequel happening to this movie.
1133120	1137480	Any anybody could call that that is 100 percent happening at this point.
1138040	1139760	There'll be a sequel to Super Mario Brothers.
1139760	1142720	I'm sure it was set up for plenty of them.
1142720	1146480	Yeah. Yeah. So that that's going to happen for sure.
1146480	1147600	Not a question.
1147600	1152720	But now the question is, how much does Nintendo start to go? Oh.
1153560	1157440	We should have maybe started to let go of some of our IPs some time ago.
1157440	1160360	I understand the 90s Mario movie bombed.
1160360	1162320	It wasn't received well, although it's interesting.
1162320	1166520	There's been some interesting look back pieces in light of this new movie.
1166520	1170360	And it's interesting to kind of read about what they were really going for
1170360	1173080	with the 90s movie and some of the places that they went wrong.
1173440	1177880	But here's what it was at the end of the day with the 90s Mario movie.
1177880	1182360	And quite honestly, a lot of video game stuff we got in the 90s.
1182640	1185880	The original Street Fighter movie, the Mortal Combat movies and so forth.
1186240	1191520	A lot of those things were brought to you by people who didn't play the games.
1191760	1194520	Or they knew a little bit of them or whatever.
1194520	1196200	The Halo series.
1198080	1199960	There's a reason I left that out for my earlier.
1199960	1205840	But anyway, but you get there's also now people now that it's a different generation, right?
1205840	1210640	Now that it's 2020s, as opposed to the 1990s, we're 30 years later.
1210880	1215480	And the people that are making movies now are the people that grew up with this stuff.
1216440	1223840	And they're making the movies that, you know, are more in line with what we wanted to see way back then.
1224400	1226280	Sorry, Bobby. Yes, it was. Do the math.
1226280	1227720	It was that long ago.
1227720	1231640	Seriously, you know, just like look at like the Sonic the Hedgehog movie
1231640	1234240	and like what trash that originally would start out as.
1234240	1237160	Like, who would have thought that like that would have been that good?
1237440	1239800	Like, you know, or even the sequel.
1239800	1242200	Well, and I'm glad you brought up the Sonic movies, because honestly,
1242200	1245240	that was also really the start of this whole recent wave.
1245240	1248840	Really, I think the pandemic kind of threw things off a little bit.
1248840	1253200	But I think Sonic doing well was certainly something that added to,
1253560	1256720	you know, what we see with the Mario movie and so forth.
1256880	1261960	So, loony barred in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network says, to be fair,
1262160	1265200	the original Mario movie is kind of a so bad it's hilarious thing.
1265200	1266920	Oh, yeah, now it is.
1266920	1270600	So but so is 90s classics such as Showgirls and stuff.
1270600	1274400	There's there's movies age differently.
1274960	1277360	I would recommend, though, that for the Mario movie,
1277360	1279480	there are a few really good documentaries
1279480	1282320	about what it was intended to be with, like original
1284040	1285480	storyboards and whatnot.
1285480	1289160	And it could have been a really good movie.
1289680	1290960	It really could have.
1290960	1296480	And it got fucked over and it was being rewritten while the movie was being.
1296480	1297800	Yeah, yeah.
1297800	1300800	Of course, then again, Xanadu was too, but Xanadu was perfection.
1301440	1302360	But I don't.
1302360	1305000	There's a lot of movie critics that would not agree with you, Jamie,
1305000	1305720	but it doesn't matter.
1305720	1307520	They're wrong to hell with what critics think.
1307520	1309280	It's what about you? It's what you think, right?
1309280	1312600	Well, you know, for the record, Olivia Newton-John said that
1312600	1316200	that was her favorite movie to shoot because she got to dance with Gene Kelly.
1316200	1318840	And my favorite horror movie of all time is Elvira,
1318840	1321280	Mistress of the Dark, and I will never change that answer.
1321600	1322720	I don't care what.
1322720	1325560	So you know what else we have coming out this year, which they put out
1325560	1329600	the first green shot from is the Five Nights at Freddy's movie.
1329680	1331800	Oh, yeah, because they're opening that.
1331800	1335360	They're opening that the same weekend as the Saw revival or whatever
1335360	1336680	they're doing with that franchise.
1336680	1338720	Yeah, Saw X or X.
1338720	1340520	I don't I don't know with a movie like that.
1340520	1343080	You don't know is it is it meant to be called X like Mortal
1343080	1345280	Kombat was or is it Saw X? I don't know.
1345840	1347800	Yeah, it's October 27th.
1347800	1352080	And my thing that I'm most excited about is the Jim Henson companies
1352080	1355920	doing the animatronics for they're doing all the puppets and everything.
1356240	1359080	So it's fun. It's going to look good.
1359280	1361680	Like, I'm not even really a huge fan of Five Nights at Freddy's,
1361680	1363520	but like, I just like the concept of that.
1363520	1365480	Like, I'd absolutely go see that.
1365480	1368400	You know, it's funny because there's a lot of people on the Internet
1368400	1370880	and things I'm seeing on social media that like it's it's foolish
1370880	1373400	for Five Nights at Freddy's to open the same weekend as Saw.
1373560	1374800	Like it's got to go.
1374800	1376800	I think the reverse is true.
1376800	1378400	I think the reverse is totally true.
1378400	1382320	I think Saw needs to run because they're look, those types of horror
1382320	1387080	movies have their crowd, but the the do not underestimate
1387560	1390920	how the kids identify like there's going to be so many kids
1390920	1392920	that want to see that movie, whether they should be or not.
1393160	1396160	But I would say it's I'm going to guess what it's going to probably go
1396160	1400000	for PG 13, right? And probably I would guess your oldest is getting
1400000	1401680	pretty close to 13, isn't he?
1401680	1405000	I feel like time will be 13 by the time the movie. Oh, my God.
1405000	1408560	So I mean, like, but your your oldest is like exactly
1408560	1410920	who I'm thinking of who's going to carry that Five Nights movie.
1412200	1415960	Like his, you know, 13 year olds are going to want to see that movie.
1416240	1418800	And ironically, he probably doesn't care about the movie at all.
1421080	1422640	That's fine, but it'll be good.
1422640	1425160	Like, I think it'll be good
1425160	1428280	if it all has to do is beat Willy's Wonderland
1428280	1430840	and Willy's Wonderland is pretty amazing.
1430840	1432680	But just because Nicolas Cage is in there.
1432680	1434000	But like, hey, you know what?
1434000	1436280	There's always room for the Five Nights at Freddy's sequel
1436280	1437680	to have Nicolas Cage in it.
1437680	1440120	But they've got Matthew Lillard in there.
1440120	1441840	So like, I love Matthew Lillard.
1441840	1444800	So I. I mean, I can't wait.
1444800	1445480	It's going to be awesome.
1445480	1448000	I wouldn't want to see it unless it was rated R.
1448600	1450080	Oh, yeah, we'll see.
1450080	1452480	I don't know. It might be violent. Who knows?
1452480	1454600	You rated R, I'll go see it.
1454600	1458280	I would say best case scenario, you get a Megan situation
1458280	1461880	where it's PG 13 in the theaters and then there's like an uncut one
1461880	1464200	that they release the best case scenario.
1464200	1465760	I think that's what you get.
1465760	1468360	I need to see that. I still need to see that movie.
1468400	1471160	Oh, Megan. Yeah, so good. It's so good.
1471200	1473480	I'm kind of disappointed that Mario outgrossed it.
1473480	1475720	No, I'm kidding. It's completely expected.
1475720	1479240	All right. But let's talk about some other movies that are coming.
1479720	1483000	This one was probably already in talks before the Mario thing happened.
1483000	1484360	But this really solidifies it.
1484360	1487560	Honestly, legendary entertainment who brought us
1488240	1490000	some really big franchises as of late.
1490000	1493760	Jurassic World, Pokemon, Detective Pikachu, Dune, Godzilla vs.
1493760	1496000	Kong, Kong, Kong.
1496520	1500360	They have purchased the film and TV rights to Street Fighter.
1501240	1503320	Obviously, the Capcom franchise.
1503560	1506160	This is reported by The Hollywood Reporter.
1506160	1510200	This means any and all future projects, meaning streaming series,
1510200	1512840	anime, live action movies, all of it.
1513240	1517040	And Capcom actually went so far as to confirm
1517320	1519560	a new movie is in the works at Legendary.
1519560	1523000	In a tweet at Street Fighter wrote a new live action
1523000	1526120	Street Fighter movie is in the works, co-produced by Legendary
1526120	1527640	Entertainment and Capcom.
1527640	1529400	More news to come in the future.
1529400	1531760	So obviously that is all we know for now.
1531960	1534400	But, you know, very interesting.
1534400	1536840	Well, we just got a Mortal Kombat reboot a few years ago.
1536840	1539000	But, you know, the Street Fighter reboot, it's
1539000	1541560	it's not going to look anything like the 90s movie.
1541560	1543600	Like we have to get that out of our head.
1544560	1548000	Let's not forget, though, that there also was a 2000s movie.
1548000	1549600	There was. There was.
1549600	1552280	It was not good. Somehow worse.
1552720	1555760	It seems like it should be, you know, very significant news.
1555760	1558600	But for me, it's just a Tuesday.
1558640	1561920	Tiger Claw and Chat says what you did there. Funny.
1562160	1565960	Tiger Claw and Chat says Street Fighter is going to be tricky to adapt.
1565960	1569240	They already did it twice, and it still couldn't capture the magic of the games.
1569640	1573200	I there's actually a third adaptation live action called Street Fighter
1573200	1577560	Assassin's Fist, and it's I've I've started watching it
1578160	1579760	actually about a week or so ago.
1579760	1581400	It's actually not too bad.
1581400	1582360	It's a web series.
1582360	1587200	And the the whole thing was already compiled and put up in full on YouTube.
1587720	1589960	And it's it's pretty good.
1589960	1597640	The the style is like IRL cosplay outfit type.
1597640	1601480	Like they try to mimic the game with how they look very alpha.
1601760	1603560	But it's it's really good.
1603560	1606000	I'm really enjoying enjoying it so far.
1606000	1608760	A lot better than the other two live action attempts.
1608800	1612680	But as far as this goes, it's all out the window. It doesn't matter.
1612680	1613800	They're going to start from scratch.
1613800	1615720	There's not going to be any references to any of this older stuff.
1615720	1620080	Maybe if you're lucky, you get either a nod to Raul Julia,
1620080	1622880	which I think you'd see that like maybe a painting of him or something
1622880	1624160	that's in the background in a scene.
1624160	1626560	You see like you'll see something like that
1626560	1630400	or that the Tuesday line will somehow sneak its way into the movie.
1630400	1632720	That's that's it. That's all you're going to get.
1632720	1635000	I'm saying it now, Kylie Minogue.
1635000	1639520	Hell yeah, I would take Kylie Minogue as Kami or even a little amazing.
1639560	1643600	She could she could even cameo as like the head of British intelligence
1643600	1645520	or whatever, you know, whatever Kami comes from.
1646120	1648440	You know, the reason she was in it,
1648440	1651240	you know, the reason why she was in that movie to begin with is because
1651560	1655040	they filmed the first part of it in Thailand and then
1655440	1659240	they had to leave due to expenses and film the rest of it in Australia.
1659440	1661240	And they needed an Australian actor.
1661240	1662640	Oh, how funny.
1662640	1665440	And I'll go ahead and repeat what I said before the show,
1665440	1669920	that Sawada's character was because the actor I need
1669920	1672680	I don't remember his given name, but I know his name is Sawada.
1673080	1675800	They wanted him to play for you, but they had already cast for you.
1676280	1680440	So they basically made
1680440	1683760	they made a character for him and everyone loves him because he's amazing.
1683840	1686600	Yeah, at least he's more loved than Cole.
1687400	1692160	The reason why there are not as at the time as well-known actors in it
1692160	1695680	was because it put all of their hiring budget into getting Jean-Claude Van Damme.
1696200	1698880	Hmm. OK, bring him back.
1698880	1700760	It's Colonel Guile. He could still do it.
1701040	1703120	Nobody from the older movies is coming back.
1703120	1705680	Maybe a cameo, but that's it.
1705680	1708000	Have Jean-Claude Van Damme play Bison.
1708000	1709960	No, Jean-Claude Van Damme is going to be nowhere near this movie.
1710440	1714880	Or wait, no, bring him back as a really angry, grizzled Rolento.
1714880	1717240	No, they don't they don't want ties to the old stuff.
1717240	1718920	This is going to be brand new.
1718920	1723000	I know, I know. But I could totally see him playing Rolento now.
1723000	1726680	I'm curious if they adapt Street Fighter II,
1726680	1728880	which is kind of like the most well known with those characters,
1728880	1733280	or if they start to incorporate, you know, more expanded universe,
1733280	1734800	because they're really just the mainline universe.
1734800	1737720	I'm talking about the rosters for four or five and soon to be six.
1737920	1739960	If we start to see some of those characters come into play,
1739960	1743040	or if it's if like they do two first and then if it does well,
1743040	1746240	maybe we'll see some of those more expanded roster characters in a sequel.
1746240	1747640	I don't know. I don't know.
1747640	1750080	This is going to come from a different creative team who grew up with it.
1750560	1753160	It's not it's going to be better.
1753160	1755240	It has to be. It has to be.
1755240	1757040	It can't be worse than the Chun-Li movie.
1759080	1765600	So anyway, but there are some good names in that that first live action movie.
1765600	1766480	Oh, no, there were.
1766480	1772120	Yeah, West Duty and I mean, some pretty amazing people.
1772120	1774120	And we had the future Leatherface.
1774520	1777840	Mm hmm. He played Zangief.
1777840	1780800	Yeah, we had a lot of, you know, for the time, big names in that movie.
1781000	1784160	And somebody in chat had said to kind of that that trivia fact that, oh,
1784160	1786920	Julia only did that movie because his grandkids wanted him to.
1787160	1788800	And he did it like a favor to them.
1788800	1792680	And he was also ridiculously sick.
1793040	1797800	Yeah. So the reason that everyone was supposed to go through weeks
1797800	1804000	of of martial arts training while he filmed his scenes first.
1805160	1808560	But he was so sick that they actually had to have
1808560	1811240	everyone do their scenes while he recovered.
1812960	1816680	And he was like the outfit that he wore was simply
1816680	1819680	to hide just how thin he had become.
1820080	1822720	Well, he's he's the reason to see that movie if, you know,
1822720	1825920	to put as much as there are other interesting actors and actresses.
1825920	1827880	Every movie he's in. Yeah.
1827880	1829840	But anyway, it's such a good villain.
1830200	1833160	Back to the Mario and you know what this is going to mean for the future.
1833160	1838400	I wonder now, because obviously the 90s movie and that whole experience
1838680	1843120	scared Nintendo away from making movies based off their IP for a very long time,
1843760	1848960	save the occasional maybe like anime because there was like an animal crossing thing.
1848960	1852000	Right. So very rare sort of thing.
1852920	1856840	I'm very curious to see if they start to green light
1856840	1858680	some more of their stuff to become movies.
1858680	1864080	And I, I really do think the success of this movie means in the next five years,
1864080	1866520	we're going to get that holy grail of video game adaptations.
1866520	1868320	Everyone's what everyone wants.
1868320	1870320	And that's The Legend of Zelda as a movie.
1870520	1872440	I have no idea how they tackle it.
1872440	1877560	What game they try to go for, if it would be a Breath of the Wild or it doesn't really matter.
1877840	1882680	But I think Zelda becomes a movie in the next five years based off the success of Mario.
1882680	1884560	It has to. It has to.
1886600	1890360	Anyway, it'd be interesting to see what develops, but I'm looking forward to seeing
1892360	1895800	the Mario movie at some point and catching all those references, that's for sure.
1895960	1897320	All right, let's move on.
1897320	1900280	We got to get into more news this week and our gaming weeks.
1900680	1902200	Yeah, one thing before that, though.
1902200	1905360	Yeah, because I was asked to say so.
1905360	1907320	Remember, I messaged you.
1908200	1910360	We have a message from Sturlock.
1911360	1914080	He lost his dad this morning very suddenly.
1915240	1918600	And he said to not take the ones you love for granted.
1919720	1922000	And I think that everyone needs to find
1922360	1924840	the people that they care about in their lives and tell them so.
1926480	1929760	Well, very sorry to hear that news, Sturlock, but we're all thinking of you.
1929760	1933160	And your family, both biological and chosen at this time.
1933160	1935120	So sending love.
1937120	1939680	All right. Well, hard to transition from that.
1939680	1942560	But let's do what we usually do and talk about our gaming weeks
1942560	1944280	and the types of video games we've been playing this week.
1944280	1945680	So Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1947960	1950640	It was kind of the usual.
1951360	1955280	I played more Beatlemania Pinball, which we are going to be buying it.
1955640	1957920	Oh, you are. OK, we are
1958920	1962440	probably going to do a trade and a buy.
1962440	1964800	And but I freaking love it.
1964800	1967040	I love it. I sing along with it, which is funny
1967040	1970560	because it's not even my favorite era of Beatles.
1970560	1974520	And then I played Marvel Midnight Suns.
1974520	1975560	I'm actually going to be doing that
1975560	1978800	instead of my retro night through the end of the month, because I've
1979320	1982840	I've been feeling that a little bit more lately, and I need to get my brain
1982840	1984800	back into the mindset for Star Ocean.
1985320	1988000	I've been playing
1988960	1992640	I actually bought Meet Your Maker for the cosmetics,
1994280	1996160	but I played it before.
1996160	2000800	But I'm definitely going to try to give the game another another shot.
2001960	2004560	Of course, I'm playing Dead by Daylight.
2004560	2006680	I hit Eerie One again for Survivor.
2007560	2009920	I guess I'm a Survivor main now.
2009920	2012720	What's wrong with me, Rob? What's wrong with me?
2012800	2015240	You have your own little squad that you run with now,
2015240	2017120	and when you play killer, you don't get to play with your friends.
2017120	2019240	So it's I mean, that's the big thing that change.
2019520	2022560	Go back and build my skills back up for my adepts,
2023280	2025880	which I will be working on a little bit on the 19th
2025880	2029480	on my my my birthday party on my channel.
2030360	2032280	It is not your fault, Gwen.
2032280	2034040	I'm going to tell you this right now.
2034040	2036920	You helped me because I wanted cosmetics.
2036960	2040160	It's the cosmetic addict's fault.
2040160	2042600	You you facilitated it,
2043080	2045360	but I wanted the the cosmetics.
2045600	2049600	I'm going to I'm going to give Gwen some big credit because she's been with you
2049600	2052080	from the very beginning when streaming Survivor and so forth.
2052080	2055160	She's been she's been the the I don't know, the
2055640	2057400	I'm not going to say it's your fault.
2057400	2060440	I'm going to say that you facilitated a lot of it. Yes.
2060440	2062920	You facilitated a lot of it.
2062920	2067760	So look, she's she's taken many hits and hooks, so you don't have to, OK?
2068600	2070800	That's true. That is absolutely true.
2070840	2072800	She is a founding member of Team Yeet.
2073880	2075880	I told you about how Team Yeet came about, right?
2075880	2077280	Oh, yeah, I think I was there that night.
2077280	2078560	Y'all did that. Yeah.
2078560	2079840	Yeah, that was fun.
2079840	2083000	And we're going to be we're going to have more Team Yeet action.
2083440	2085400	Just letting y'all know.
2085400	2087720	But but no, I like to say that
2087720	2090760	it's not so much of a blame thing as a facilitation.
2091320	2093920	I the wheels were in motion and actually
2094200	2097480	the first person I played Survivor with people
2097760	2100760	was Nick and Isaaco.
2101480	2105840	When they were still doing the the Nuzlocke thing.
2107360	2109440	But I bought a game today.
2109440	2113080	I ordered it so that we would get it when it comes out.
2113080	2114640	I ordered Osmond.
2114640	2119640	Oh, which for people who actually keep up with episode numbers.
2119640	2121160	And I looked it up.
2121160	2125720	It was episode seven hundred and ninety four that I did Osmond,
2126720	2134880	which was a game that was done by the designer of
2136280	2141600	of Capcom staff, Yotsui Koichi, who did Strider.
2142320	2146200	And Osmond was the first unofficial sequel to Strider.
2148000	2151960	And it's such a good game, but it's very obviously a Strider clone.
2152640	2157920	But I I'm not looking at anything
2157920	2162440	that Bobby says right now because I ordered for delivery.
2164440	2167240	But it's a game that's fond in our house.
2167240	2169000	You know, Dan's favorite game is Strider.
2169000	2172360	Yep. And, you know, we can't all have the great taste
2172360	2174560	to put the guardian legend at the top of our list.
2174560	2177000	But Strider is up there.
2177000	2179080	So I allow it. I allow it.
2179680	2186800	And that's really about I'm playing my stupid word game again to like
2187520	2189600	there's almost no challenge anymore.
2189600	2192560	I need I need something that has I need a game
2192560	2195600	like like word scapes that has a larger vocabulary.
2198160	2201600	Because I know these words.
2202640	2205800	There are some interesting words that pop in there that I'm like,
2206160	2209480	I don't know how people, you know, would know these otherwise,
2209480	2212560	but they do in there.
2212560	2217000	And oh, gosh, Bobby, I really want what rush.
2217640	2221160	I think we had the Mandalorian topper when we had the Mandalorian.
2222160	2224360	We have a topper for
2226920	2227960	Black Knight, sort of.
2227960	2229040	What's a pinball topper?
2229040	2231640	Is that the little figure that like hooks to the top of the machine?
2231760	2233640	OK, I've seen those. Yeah, the thing on top.
2233640	2237680	Yeah, I have the one for for Black Knight, sort of rage.
2237720	2240280	The thing is, we don't have a Black Knight, sort of rage.
2240520	2243760	Oops. Awesome table.
2243760	2246400	Our Weird Al should be coming in a couple of months, too.
2246400	2248400	We're going to be broke.
2249440	2252120	But anyway, that that's been the gaming,
2252120	2255640	and I'm actually hoping to get some Among Us time in this week.
2255640	2256960	That would be fun.
2256960	2258000	It's awesome.
2258000	2260440	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
2260440	2262000	Um, it was just Minecraft.
2262000	2265800	I've been working on stuff for my modded series,
2265800	2269920	and I finished the build in that and
2271360	2273400	just get into editing the video now.
2274160	2275440	So hopefully we'll get that soon.
2275440	2277440	Still no word on the contest thing.
2277960	2280160	It's been over almost four weeks now.
2280160	2282960	We'll be coming up on four weeks of this Wednesday. So.
2284320	2286560	I mean, I don't know.
2287480	2289160	Aside from that, though,
2289200	2292960	there was a cool like April 1st version of Minecraft
2292960	2295640	with the vote update, so I've been filming stuff on there as well.
2296840	2299320	Hopefully I'll make a video out of that, too.
2299360	2302560	I haven't really been playing too much of that.
2302560	2304120	But I'm trying to get lots of videos.
2304120	2307560	I took two days off this week to hopefully do some of that,
2307560	2310840	but I didn't get to a lot of it. So.
2311920	2315280	Hopefully this week, maybe today, I don't know.
2317160	2318920	All right. My gaming week.
2318920	2322280	So before I get to the actual games, I have an interesting story
2322280	2323800	I have to kind of tell here on OLR.
2323800	2326480	And it's kind of what's been going on in my personal life the last few weeks.
2326480	2330560	So last week, I couldn't really talk about this,
2330560	2332840	but I can now because everything wrapped up on Friday.
2332840	2335560	But for the last two weeks, I've been on jury duty.
2336080	2339600	So it's, you know, something that you have to do once in a while,
2339600	2342200	you know, especially if your employer pays for it like mine does.
2342200	2343640	And it's not going to cause you a hardship.
2343640	2345600	I get to do that next week. Oh, boy.
2345600	2347400	Maybe you'll end up in the same place
2347400	2349160	I was because they just wrapped everything on Friday.
2349160	2351200	But anyway, here's the thing.
2351200	2353440	Here's the interesting story about that whole thing.
2353440	2355840	I don't really want to talk about the specifics of the case,
2355840	2357760	because quite honestly,
2357760	2362280	my brain hurts from the days of deliberations on all that.
2362280	2363360	And that's all I'm going to say.
2363360	2364760	So it's just, yeah.
2364760	2366880	But here's the funny, actual funny part.
2367560	2370240	So, you know, when they're doing the jury selection,
2370240	2372800	which takes like a day and a half, right?
2372800	2374960	You know, they're going through and they're interviewing everybody.
2374960	2376920	And I realized I didn't realize it right away,
2376920	2378280	but I realized on a break,
2378280	2381240	we were all kind of sitting out from the hall and I'm looking across from him,
2381240	2384920	like, this guy looks kind of familiar. And I'm like, Drew?
2385760	2389280	And he's like, yeah, hi. I was wondering when you noticed me. Yeah.
2389320	2393760	Intern Drew and I were on the same fucking case at jury duty. How's that?
2393760	2397680	What a small world is that? So for those that don't know, intern Drew,
2398000	2400280	when we were doing the show more live, you know,
2400280	2404240	we'd have like the actual like people in the, in the room, not just us,
2404240	2405840	but we had guests all the time and all that stuff.
2406000	2409400	So Drew was infamous when we used to do this show in the garage.
2409920	2412640	He knocked over the soundboard in the middle of one show. It was really funny.
2412640	2415800	But anyway, but here's, here's why that's funny and why I bring it up.
2416240	2418280	Because as part of the whole process,
2418280	2420320	when they're deciding who's going to be on the jury and who's not,
2420680	2424280	they actually ask you a series of question. And one of them is,
2424480	2429040	do you know any of the other jurors? And I had to be like, actually,
2429040	2434000	yes I do. And they probably don't hear that one a lot. And they're like,
2434000	2438320	well, who do you know? And I pointed it out. And so how do you know him?
2438360	2439920	And I had to say, well, we,
2439920	2444720	we run in similar nerdy gaming type of circles and he's been on my podcast.
2444720	2449080	And then the judge wants to ask about the podcast and wants to ask like, am I,
2449080	2451240	do I know not to talk about the case on the podcast?
2451240	2453760	Which obviously I did not last week when this was still going on.
2453760	2456640	I can say stuff now. I don't want to talk about the case anyways.
2456640	2459760	I'm not going to tell you those specifics, but I'll tell you, you know,
2459800	2461160	about this. Cause it's funny.
2461440	2466280	And the fact that now it's on official record legal
2466280	2471000	record that this podcast exists finally acknowledgement in
2471000	2474120	some form or the other, all because I knew Drew,
2474280	2478000	but I guess the punchline to all that drew did not get selected for the jury
2478000	2482800	because they pulled like 60 people into that room and they had the jury after
2482800	2484000	the first 20 or so.
2484000	2487080	So they never got to like two thirds of that room had to come there for like
2487080	2490680	two days, never to even get called up. And Drew was one of those folks.
2490840	2492800	So he got to go, but I had,
2493000	2497880	I had to text him after it was done going like you won't believe how that
2497880	2501880	went. So anyway,
2502840	2505000	that's out. Oh, the other interesting thing about that,
2505000	2509160	I have to give a hello to any of the other jurors that I met who might be
2509160	2509560	listening.
2509560	2513560	Cause I'm going to tell you there were more people legitimately interested in my
2513560	2517560	podcast at jury duty than there were the last E3 I went to.
2518120	2521960	So if any of the jurors I was on the case with actually made it this far into
2521960	2524160	the podcast, like thank you for,
2524360	2527040	cause God knows you heard enough of me the last two days.
2527440	2530040	Thank you for being here this far into the show.
2530040	2532520	And I'm glad you enjoy it and all that good stuff. But that was,
2532560	2537240	that was just a isn't that interesting. Wow. Type of thing. Small world, right?
2537280	2541640	Small world. So I see, I see Drew twice a week. I know that's why,
2541640	2544440	that's why I texted you going, um, I need Drew's contact info.
2544480	2547080	Like after it was done, I'm sure that came out in the blue. Like,
2547080	2548520	why does Rob want to talk to Drew?
2548520	2551440	But I was able to tell you cause it was after Friday at that point. But yeah,
2551800	2556440	I remember Drew saying that he wasn't chosen for a case at work and I was like,
2556440	2558840	Oh, okay. You know, and then now this comes up.
2558840	2559840	Guess who was,
2562320	2564240	but it was, it was literally luck of the draw.
2564440	2568880	Like my number was 11 in the list, which puts you,
2568920	2570200	it's one of the first 12.
2570240	2573640	So if the prosecution or defense doesn't kick you at that point,
2573840	2576360	based on the answers to your question, you're stuck. You're there.
2577040	2578440	I will say this is the irony.
2578440	2582760	So this is the second case I've ever sat on jury for the last one was in 2006,
2582960	2585960	long time ago. The show was still going, but it was a long time ago, right?
2586360	2589480	I was also juror 11 in that case.
2590080	2593840	So that number is fucking cursed. That's all I have to say.
2594800	2597360	It's what I shouldn't, I shouldn't it, you know,
2597400	2601200	I was really irritated at first because you know, my day job and all this stuff,
2601200	2603880	but then you get to a certain point where you're invested in it and you're like,
2603920	2608280	all right, I want to give this a fair shot. I want to do what's right.
2608320	2611720	I want to, you know, so yeah, I think it'll be fun. Oh yeah.
2612800	2614880	I was telling Shane about it and he was like, man,
2614880	2617200	I never get called for jury duty. I want to do it. And I'm like,
2617720	2621840	next time I get a summons, you can have it. Just, just go tell them you're me.
2621920	2622960	It wouldn't be so bad.
2622960	2627280	Like if I wasn't in Sacramento County cause driving, I hate driving downtown.
2627400	2631200	That's really it. Like it is the worst for me. I got to go home on lunch.
2631920	2634400	Oh, well, lucky you. But like, um,
2634960	2639320	I'm going to be that far from where I live if it, if it wasn't like, you know,
2639880	2643800	driving downtown and parking and all that, like the parking lots and.
2644200	2646000	The parking lot is not that bad anymore.
2646000	2647160	The parking lot really isn't bad.
2647160	2651480	I think they call less people because of COVID that it was not bad at all.
2652240	2655280	OK, well, that's good at least because it used to be a nightmare
2655280	2656560	just to do all that stuff.
2656600	2660320	No, I mean, that said though, at least I would enjoy like the local eateries
2660320	2662840	around there. They've got a really nice, like New York style,
2662880	2666760	or it's actually like a New York pizza chain or pizza place,
2667120	2668880	authentic New York stuff. They have that there.
2668880	2673200	Then they have like an authentic French soup place. That's also awesome. So,
2673600	2674440	uh, hopefully.
2676520	2678320	As the show and how to Matt and chat says, you know,
2678320	2681520	some legal intern had to listen to the show to make sure Rob didn't say
2681520	2685280	anything. I don't think so. No, I, I, yeah,
2685280	2687520	because I don't think they ever asked the name. I'm trying to remember.
2687520	2692120	I don't think she ever asked the name of it, but it's, what am I going to say?
2692200	2694280	Like, if I told you what the case was about,
2694320	2699120	it literally has nothing to do with anything that ever comes up on this program.
2699360	2703640	So it's like, why would I bring it up? So there's no, there's no point. So,
2705560	2708480	um, but yeah, so then, but, but there was,
2708520	2712440	so one of the people who had asked about my show was a juror who ultimately did
2712480	2716600	get kicked off. So she might've heard last week's show. I don't know.
2716600	2720040	If you're out there, hi, hi. Say, say hello, drop me a line on Twitter at Mr.
2720040	2724120	Rob Roberts. So let's say, say hello or whatever. Um, but yeah,
2724160	2726120	there was some, it was, uh, one of the other days I was,
2726160	2729200	so I didn't play a lot of games there at the courthouse cause you can't,
2729200	2732200	they're very strict. Like you cannot have your phones on in the courtroom just,
2732400	2733840	but when you're in the hallway killing time,
2733840	2735960	I would sit there and I'd have Pokemon go open.
2736200	2738640	And I was like catching stuff that was spawning around the courthouse.
2738880	2741920	And it did catch the attention of one of the other jurors who came up with you
2741920	2744560	play Pokemon go. And I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2744560	2747840	I'm a little bit like trying to hide it. Like, no, that's for nerds.
2748800	2753360	Yeah. I play Pokemon go traded friend codes and all that.
2753360	2757240	So yeah, I forgot to mention, I actually, uh, opened up,
2757280	2762280	I installed an opened up ingress this weekend. Did you just, just to see,
2762480	2763320	you know,
2763800	2768520	what was going on and like where I was at in Rancho it was all gray.
2768560	2769960	Like all of it was gray.
2769960	2773760	There's a lot less people that play than they used to.
2774440	2777760	But, uh, yeah, I checked that out and I checked out Orna. Orna, I,
2778000	2781880	I can't navigate it anymore. It's just completely different now.
2781880	2786280	So I'm lost in that and ingress. I couldn't do anything. So I was like, eh,
2786440	2788080	uninstall. I don't know.
2788360	2791320	I understand. All right. So games I did play, that's enough about my outfit,
2791320	2794800	but I thought you'd all enjoy that story about how OLR sort of ended up on the
2794800	2797040	public record. Um, anyhow, uh,
2797160	2798920	so games I've played this week,
2798920	2801600	I've still continuing in Pokemon legends are chaos. Uh,
2801600	2804440	I actually am past the point I was at the first time I played through that
2804440	2804920	game.
2804920	2808040	There's something about Pokemon games where like if I start them a year after
2808040	2811040	they come out, I get a lot for actually that games out game has been out,
2811040	2812240	I think more like two years, but still,
2812440	2816960	I get a lot farther if I play after it's out and so forth than I do the first
2816960	2820200	time. I'm actually really enjoying like the game and this play through.
2820200	2822440	And I do plan on finishing it, uh,
2822480	2826400	before the pixel remasters release on console. Uh, thank you depth.
2826400	2829960	I couldn't remember if look pandemic lockdowns completely changed my sense of
2829960	2831520	time. I couldn't remember if it was one or two years.
2831520	2832440	So it's only one year old.
2832440	2835720	So I guess I beat sword and shield about a year after they came out.
2835720	2838720	So I guess I'm right on schedule and I'll probably finally get to violet and
2838720	2843360	scarlet this fall. So, Hey, it, it works out that way. But, um, yeah,
2843360	2844440	so I've been playing a lot of that,
2844440	2848120	but I'm still continuing on some old favorites, including, uh, Diablo three.
2848120	2851400	I'm at like paragraph 550 for the current season. Uh,
2851400	2854160	fall fantasy 14 been playing a little bit of that. Uh, even,
2854160	2856480	I even dipped into some dead by daylight, uh,
2856480	2860760	here and there a little bit this week. And, um, what else?
2860760	2863840	There was something else I played. I can't remember.
2863840	2867000	So it must not have been that big a deal, I guess. But, um, yeah, I just been,
2867000	2870320	you know, doing different stuff, filling time and yeah,
2870320	2873440	been enjoying the Pokemon play through that's for sure. So, uh,
2873480	2876960	looking forward to finishing up that up. All right. Uh,
2877000	2880480	we're going to get into some more gaming news and what's going on around the
2880560	2884240	industry and gaming culture as well. So let's get to it.
2884240	2885600	Loki wants to start us off.
2886520	2891040	So Microsoft doesn't want you to use their consoles for emulation,
2891800	2893520	um, is what they're trying to do.
2893520	2898040	So they've basically cracked down on folks using, uh,
2898080	2903080	emulators that were installed using the dev mode that you can put your Xbox
2903920	2907200	series S or X in, I think you can do that with the Xbox one,
2907200	2911440	but specifically the Xbox X and S, um,
2911480	2915000	allowing you to run those apps like retro arts, uh,
2915040	2918880	PP SPP and duck station, um,
2918960	2923200	using the universal windows platform versions of those games.
2924400	2928800	Um, so now they're basically cracking down on those, uh,
2929120	2930880	according to one of the developers.
2931280	2934200	So essentially Microsoft cracked down on my uploads, uh,
2934200	2939160	where they used to last months to weeks to days and until now. Um,
2939200	2943160	so I would simply re upload the apps whenever they were taken down to get
2943160	2945440	newcomers and everyone back up and running.
2946440	2950480	But it says the crackdown started ramp up around the end of summer going into
2950480	2953720	autumn, where they dealt with daily tech downs for awhile.
2953720	2956920	So the day after they went up, they'd be taken down.
2957160	2960600	We managed to find a way to get them the last three days. Um,
2960600	2964560	so I'm not naming them retro arch instead using randomized names.
2965840	2967320	Um, but yeah,
2967320	2972080	they're just increasingly being taken down if they're seen to be like a emulator
2972080	2974520	or something like that. So you're just gonna,
2974560	2978920	you're just gonna have to use the PC like everybody else or,
2978920	2981920	or a steam deck or whatever else that you want to run it on.
2981960	2986120	Well, I imagine Microsoft just wants nothing to do with the perception. Again,
2986120	2988480	it's, it's not always about what's right and wrong,
2988480	2989840	but it's about the perception, right?
2989840	2993120	And Microsoft does not even want that perception of, look,
2993120	2997560	you can play Zelda on your Xbox just by using this specific, they don't want,
2997560	2998120	they don't want that.
2998120	2999760	That's not what the modes for anyways.
2999760	3004200	The mode is meant for people developing games to be able to test them on the
3004200	3006280	hardware that they are being developed for,
3006280	3010640	not to install apps to run side layers. Yeah. Yeah.
3010720	3013600	So besides you have the dolphin emulator coming to steam still,
3013600	3016760	if that is to be, that is still on track, right? As far as we know,
3016800	3020600	we haven't seen a shutdown or anything. It's going to be interesting. So,
3021280	3024000	all right, we'll see. All right, moving on.
3024000	3026560	Let's talk about one of my favorite games. No Man's Sky.
3026600	3031360	No Man's Sky got another update this week. I mean, it's, it's been six weeks.
3031360	3032320	There must be another update.
3032560	3036280	This update is called the interceptor update and the interceptor update will
3036280	3040360	actually add new ships to the game as well as something called corrupt worlds.
3040960	3044960	So these planets can turn into purple hazed worlds that have purple crystals.
3045200	3049000	And then it basically has changed a little bit of the sentinels.
3049160	3052160	So there are some new sentinel types. So some new enemies there,
3052160	3055680	they're spider-like and yes, crab-like machines.
3055840	3057280	They're not giant enemy crabs though.
3057280	3059040	They're small enemy crabs just for the record.
3059160	3061040	If there's purple hazes on those planets,
3061040	3062880	have you run into captain Jimi Hendrix?
3063520	3067560	No, no I have not. But I can, let me see,
3067560	3070640	there was a trailer for this out somewhere and of course I don't have it up,
3070640	3071840	but let me see if I can find it.
3072520	3073960	And purple crystals on everything.
3073960	3076760	That's starting to sound like the suicide squad trailer.
3077600	3079560	Yeah, but it actually looks, oops, sorry.
3079600	3081040	Little Xbox noise there in the background,
3081040	3086040	but that's because I actually have what that looks like
3086040	3087800	here on the side. Hold on. I'm multitasking.
3087800	3089640	Cause the husband just brought me coffee. Thank you.
3091080	3093640	Let me show you this real quick here on the other monitor,
3093640	3098360	what this looks like while I talk about this. Sorry. There we go. Okay.
3099360	3103200	So you can see that like it's these corrupt world planets look very purply
3103200	3104440	and so forth is what they have.
3104640	3108760	They're also talking improved visuals and new features for virtual reality.
3108760	3110920	So I know that just went live not that long ago,
3111040	3114360	but they've done some perfections on that. And then of course,
3114360	3116920	these new Sentinel type ships are in there too.
3117080	3119600	There's also an ability called the anti-gravity well,
3119600	3124280	that could be very interesting and fun. Also improvements focused on Xbox.
3124360	3126160	I always thought the game looked fine on Xbox,
3126160	3127120	but I guess there are some,
3127120	3130600	some imperfections that they were ironing out for smooth and consistent
3130600	3133880	frame rate. Anyway, that is all out now. Again,
3133880	3136800	that is the no man's sky interceptor update.
3137040	3141520	Here's the thing for me and why I'm not like super excited about this is that
3141520	3144840	this is a little more of a combat focused update. It sounds like,
3144840	3146400	especially with the upgrades to Sentinels.
3146840	3151680	And I did not particularly care for the last combat update that they did.
3151960	3155480	Why did my co-hosts go gray all of a sudden? Uh oh.
3156640	3160360	Are you all still there? Oh, that was so weird. Sorry. Yeah, that was weird.
3160360	3164520	Anyway. Um, but, um, yeah, so it's,
3164520	3168240	it's neat that this updates out. I'm not super enthused about combat updates,
3168240	3172960	but I do appreciate that the difficulty tuning update will allow you to
3172960	3176320	change the difficulty, uh, down so that you don't see these as much.
3176760	3179200	I just think, um,
3180920	3184960	I just think that, um, the next expedition, whenever that comes out,
3184960	3186960	because they didn't, this didn't launch with an expedition,
3186960	3189240	which I thought was interesting. Cause it was about time for one.
3189520	3191960	Maybe they're ironing out. Cause I feel like they did this last time.
3191960	3194880	They're ironing out all the bugs before they launch it. Uh,
3194920	3198320	we'll probably focus on this stuff. And I don't know if I'm going to like that.
3199080	3203040	Uh, because I'm not super big on the combat. It can be difficult sometimes,
3203040	3206400	but we'll see. Maybe I love the game. Don't get me wrong.
3206400	3207920	This is just the one area of the game.
3207920	3210840	I don't like as much as the other areas like exploration and building and all
3210840	3214480	that stuff. The purple planets look cool though. I will say that. So,
3215040	3217560	uh, a big hello to Marissa Meisel, who's in our chat saying,
3217560	3221200	I thought court cases on these issues tend to rule that you can do what you
3221200	3224400	want with your product after you buy it. Not endorsing law breaking,
3224400	3227040	but you get the idea. Yeah, you're right. Marissa,
3227080	3231200	like you can do whatever you want with your Xbox. It's it's your Xbox, right? Uh,
3231240	3234600	but Microsoft still, still doesn't want that perception out there.
3234840	3239760	They still have the right to what they can and they can't put on the store and
3239760	3240280	you know,
3240280	3243920	putting the blocks in there so that you can't install your own stuff because
3243920	3245600	it's also a store place, right?
3245960	3249040	But if you do find a way to sideload apps and so forth,
3249240	3252680	then that's on you and you can essentially do what you want. Uh,
3252680	3256960	that all goes back to the PlayStation three, I want to say, and the other OS,
3257160	3258280	remember the government,
3258320	3263280	the government loved PlayStation three because it was a powerful
3263280	3265160	supercomputer for not too expensive.
3265440	3268240	But then when they got rid of the other OS saying that actually affected the
3268240	3271600	government, but you didn't have to update. What's that?
3272520	3276160	Wasn't it the PS2 that ran Linux? No, it was PS3. No, it was PS3. Yeah.
3276880	3280640	They may have had a PS2 Linux thing. Yeah, they may have had a PS2, but not,
3280640	3284520	not like officially supported. So anyway.
3285320	3288680	All right. Um, but that is the No Man's Sky Interceptor update.
3288680	3291440	Let's move on to our next story from Dark Sakura.
3293120	3297440	So, um, wow, Konami, and this doesn't have anything to do with Pachi slot.
3298440	3298800	Uh,
3298800	3303800	Konami is really working on a game developing comeback and they announced,
3305280	3308960	um, that their Osaka studio is now open.
3309240	3312640	It is a development focused studio with, uh,
3313120	3317800	the best brand newest equipment to build new games for, uh,
3317840	3322280	the current, uh, consoles and those on their way. Um,
3323360	3324440	they said, uh,
3325440	3329520	that they're opening the Konami's group, uh, next generation, uh,
3329560	3334160	R and D in 2025. And that, uh,
3334640	3338080	you know, they should be done with outsourcing, you know,
3338080	3340040	like they're doing with Silent Hill right now.
3340640	3344760	And they are going to actually, my apologies.
3344760	3349200	They say they are still going to be doing some outsourcing like they are with,
3349240	3352600	uh, Silent Hill. Um, but,
3352680	3354160	and this is the quote, uh,
3354160	3359160	the Konami Osaka studio is a developmental relocation of the existing studio and
3360800	3365760	comes with the concept of creators first. Um,
3366240	3371240	so they want to have the best environment for development where their creators
3372400	3374840	can reach their full potential.
3376880	3380920	They're going to be over 9,000, but their,
3381000	3383520	their R and D, um, center, like I said,
3383520	3388520	is going to be done by 2025 and it's called Konami creative front Tokyo Bay.
3389600	3394120	And it is, uh, in construction at Ariake, uh, Kotaku.
3394880	3396400	So there you go.
3397280	3400240	I have to admit I'm, I'm skeptical. You know,
3400280	3402560	Konami hasn't done a lot of great stuff for me,
3402560	3404000	especially in the home entertainment space.
3404000	3406400	I realized the arcade divisions been kicking, you know,
3406400	3408480	and doing good stuff for a while now.
3409000	3411880	Obviously I have reasons to distrust Konami in this space,
3411880	3415560	but I'm also willing to look at it and go, look,
3415600	3418960	this has been going on for years and maybe Konami is realizing they have to do
3418960	3423640	something different. And if this is a start of something different and maybe,
3423640	3428240	you know, this is not just a new office, but a newly managed office, a newly,
3428600	3433120	you know, and it's a sign of a future thing, then I remain open to it.
3433400	3435680	Let's see what they put out there. Um,
3435840	3439320	I know we've got that Suikoden remake that's coming out that, you know,
3439320	3441760	people are very excited about. Um,
3442160	3444160	I don't think that one is actually outsourced.
3444160	3447880	I think that is an in-house thing they're doing. I could be wrong on that. Uh,
3447920	3450760	but you know, it could be, it could be the start.
3450960	3454880	There's been rumors for a while about Castlevania coming back in some form or
3454880	3458600	another. So, uh, it could be very interesting to see what the studio brings us,
3458600	3462800	but I, you can understand if I'm a little bit cautiously, I have huge,
3462960	3467560	like I, I need to see the, the facts to get me really excited on this stuff.
3467560	3471960	Right. So, yeah, I'm with SHO 100 Matt in chat.
3472000	3475320	I'm open-minded, but I'm careful in getting my hopes up.
3476200	3479480	It's a very good way of putting it. All right, let's move on. Loki.
3480640	3481160	All right.
3481160	3485640	So let's talk a little bit more about how Nintendo is cracking down on things.
3485640	3487680	And so now they're coming after.
3487680	3489320	It's not just Microsoft this week.
3489480	3491960	It's not just Microsoft. Um, no,
3492000	3494360	they're are coming after point crow,
3494360	3499040	who is a YouTuber who also developed a mod for breath of the
3499040	3501720	wild, but allows you to play it in multiplayer.
3501720	3505200	I'm familiar with point crow because he tends to team up with Doug, Doug,
3505200	3509640	and I watched Doug, Doug religiously. Um, and I have watched them play.
3509640	3512240	It sounds like an awesome mod. It is pretty cool.
3512240	3515160	They do like different challenges and stuff like that using it.
3515200	3516880	And it's just kind of a lot of fun. Well,
3516880	3520080	of course Nintendo has been taking down, um,
3520160	3524280	or demonetizing his videos that feature that mod,
3524920	3529560	basically copyright claiming them. And, um, you know,
3530440	3534760	that's kind of annoying, but also I guess kind of expected, um,
3534760	3536960	according to point grow, he posts on Twitter,
3536960	3540080	incredibly disappointed in 10 of America has decided to block my videos and
3540080	3540920	breath of the wild.
3541160	3544880	It's the love for the community and innovation that we bring that has kept it
3544880	3548480	alive and brought new people to love the Zelda series.
3548640	3552240	I hope you reverse your decision. Uh, they won't. Um,
3553360	3555000	and then of course they go along with that though.
3555000	3558400	He also did release the mod to the public. Um,
3558440	3561200	I think that actually was before they took that stuff down.
3561480	3565400	Might have been why they took that stuff or, uh, tried to copyright claim it,
3565400	3567160	but, um,
3567840	3570560	too late once on the internet, always on the internet.
3570920	3574360	Yep. So, so, well, that's, I mean,
3575360	3576160	I don't know what to think,
3576160	3579640	because obviously Nintendo is notorious about protecting its IPS,
3579640	3584120	especially when you start to do these types of things. Right. Um, and I, you know,
3584120	3587800	there's a new Zelda game on the horizon and I know it doesn't have multiplayer
3588320	3593400	out the gate anyway, but who's to say if there's one thing, you know,
3593560	3597080	I know y'all have been joking in chat and I've been joking myself about making a
3597080	3600640	lot of predictions that came true this year. Right. But here's what,
3600720	3602120	here's what anyone can predict.
3602360	3605720	There's going to be DLC for the new Zelda game. Here's the game,
3605760	3607560	but there will be DLC at some point for that.
3608080	3610240	Who's to say the multiplayer wouldn't be maybe one of the,
3611800	3614120	it won't be because they don't know that the internet exists.
3614120	3617400	So therefore it won't be like, I know we joke about Nintendo,
3617400	3620400	like being well behind the times when it comes to technology, but yeah,
3620400	3624720	I just don't think that they're going to put effort into develop multiplayer in
3624720	3628400	this game. I don't think one that their engine can run it. Um,
3628480	3632800	cause this is being done through emulation and on a PC.
3632960	3637840	Oh, that's the no, no part. That's the no, no part. So that,
3637840	3641400	that's how they're able to do a lot of these mods. I mean, that's just any mod.
3641400	3645920	It's really through emulation and modding, um, the ISO and stuff like that.
3646360	3650680	So I just don't think that they're going to be able to pull that off with just
3650720	3655120	the Nintendo switch hardware, maybe on another system. Yeah. But like right now,
3655120	3657840	they're just not going to do it. I just don't see it happening.
3657960	3662440	I did not realize it was just like a modded switch thing. It was actually a PC.
3662640	3664000	Uh, that's why they don't,
3664200	3666200	they don't want people knowing you can play it on your PC.
3666200	3669760	They still sell copies of breath of the wild full price, by the way.
3669840	3673840	There's still like, yeah, and there's still like things I've, I watch. Um,
3673880	3676160	one of the things I watched Doug Doug do a lot is, uh,
3676160	3680200	the breath of the wild randomizers were randomize and stuff.
3680200	3684000	So that's kind of neat, but yeah, it's just a lot of that stuff.
3684040	3687520	Obviously in any randomizer that you see on the internet nowadays,
3687520	3692520	for any game it's just done through emulation. And so, yeah, I mean,
3693480	3697000	I mean, I don't think it's really hurting anything honestly, but like,
3697000	3700200	I get it. Like if you want to like take down something like take down,
3700200	3703320	like cease and desist the mod or something like that,
3703600	3707960	but like copyright claiming a video and that just seems weird,
3708000	3711520	especially when it's like, we'll copyright claim a video that's using the mod,
3711520	3714560	but we won't copyright claim a video that just features the game.
3715560	3718160	It's just, it's, it's a way to, it's a, I mean,
3718160	3721600	yes it's well within the right to do that cause they own some of the content,
3721960	3726360	but it's also just a way to abuse that content system to stop people from not
3726360	3729640	seeing things that you don't want them to see is really what it comes down to.
3729640	3733360	So it's like, it's a legal gray area, but I mean,
3733360	3734800	they're, they're abusing their powers.
3735200	3738920	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf points out some randomizers will spit out a ROM image and
3738920	3742040	you can play it on original hardware. Yeah. There's a lot of, um, like, you know,
3742560	3746160	the eight bit randomizers or even 16 bit. Uh, yeah,
3746160	3747200	I spit out a new ROM image.
3747200	3749920	I know I was fucking around with like Zelda randomizers, Metroid.
3750080	3753520	There's actually that really cool Zelda and Metroid randomizer.
3753520	3756280	I really liked that one where like you go into a dungeon and it spits you out
3756300	3760400	Metroid somewhere. It's pretty cool. So, um, let's see.
3760640	3762240	Marissa in chat says, uh,
3762280	3765600	my boyfriend said we'll get Tears of the Kingdom when it's on sale over
3765600	3768040	Christmas. And I laughed and laughed. He doesn't know.
3768560	3770720	I would say your best bet with that, if you,
3770800	3772600	I don't even know if these are available anymore.
3772600	3776040	Somebody will have to let me know. But Nintendo had that whole, um,
3776480	3780880	two game ticket that you buy a ticket for like a hundred dollars and you can get
3780880	3784320	two games with it. That will be your best chance to get that game.
3784680	3787760	I think $20 off. Cause they're selling that for 70 now. Right?
3787960	3790880	So that ticket will let you have it for 50 essentially,
3791080	3793720	but you have to have another game that you also want to get on sale.
3793720	3797740	So it's like the, it's the Costco deal. You get a discount,
3797740	3801580	but you've got to buy a bulk and that's about the closest thing probably to
3801580	3804460	that right now. If that's even still available, I'm not sure it is.
3804460	3807020	Somebody in chat will have to, uh, uh, verify with me.
3807020	3810580	Cause I know it was a couple of months ago they were offering that. So, um,
3811500	3814420	all right, let's move on. And I want to talk about, Ooh, Sony.
3815100	3819420	We've talked about Microsoft in the news, Nintendo and legal news. How about so,
3819420	3819780	let's,
3819780	3823860	let's go for the tic-tac-toe and talk about Sony in legal news this week.
3823980	3825300	Sony is mad.
3825660	3828940	Sony was kicking and screaming, uh,
3828980	3833820	against UK regulators about their surprising unprecedented and
3833860	3837940	irrational decision, uh, on this,
3837940	3841180	this week about allowing basically the Microsoft Activision merger to go
3841180	3846220	through. Um, some of the things that Sony said, uh, in the,
3848620	3850300	uh, their retort, uh,
3850340	3854060	the provisional findings assessed a significant body of evidence in the round to
3854100	3856940	support its finding that Microsoft would have the ability and incentive to
3856940	3858460	withhold Activision content.
3858740	3861500	And that this would substantially lessen competition by foreclosing
3861500	3864180	PlayStation. In assessing this body of evidence,
3864180	3869060	the PFs emphasize consistent with a jury jurisprudence on the
3869060	3873580	CMA's duty to assess evidence that it is particularly important in this case to
3873580	3877460	assess the merged entities incentive to foreclose by considering all the
3877460	3881660	available evidence in the round, rather than focus on a single model, uh,
3882340	3884940	or referring to the actual findings.
3884940	3888060	It gets into a lot of this legal language and so forth,
3888460	3893300	but essentially they're pissed off because they think that Microsoft could
3893300	3895620	still release versions that have different quality,
3895820	3898980	including versions that have technical issues and so forth. Uh,
3899020	3902500	Sony saying in an infamous quote, they hit social media.
3902500	3905700	Sony said call of duty gamers are passionate,
3905900	3910260	knowledgeable and sophisticated. Just like you hear on voice chat, right?
3910420	3912900	Why would you go through that?
3913020	3917300	Why would you purposely release a buggy game on a certain call?
3917540	3921380	That doesn't make any, any sense whatsoever why you would do that.
3921500	3925060	Why would you spend the time? Hey, let's purposely break this game. Yes.
3925260	3928620	Could they release a copy that has like, I don't know,
3928660	3932220	like an additional bull, additional playable character or something like that.
3932220	3935460	Spiderman. Could they do that? Maybe.
3936220	3940500	But I think that the only reason Sony would think that is because of projection
3940540	3942220	because they've done it themselves,
3942540	3946700	but like to actually intently make a game that's broken, like,
3948380	3950980	I mean, this is stupid.
3951020	3951340	Uh,
3951340	3955180	SD200 Matt says Sony is grasping at straws. They, they are,
3955220	3960020	but I also understand a little bit why, um,
3960060	3962780	they're grasping at straws. I mean, yeah, this is, I, I,
3962820	3967620	I don't think this goes well for Sony, but at the same time, you know,
3967700	3970700	I don't think this like ruins Sony or anything. It's just,
3970740	3973460	it's just another chess piece mover in this game because you know what?
3973740	3978100	Then Sony ends up buying Square Enix and we still won't get the pixel remasters
3978100	3978940	on Xbox.
3979340	3983140	I don't think they would go that far to even do the parody thing that Microsoft's
3983140	3985500	trying to do with this. So I, I just,
3985540	3988460	I don't see this bringing Sony to its knees,
3988700	3992860	but is it going to impact their business? Sure. But them's the break Sony.
3993740	3997260	I think Sony's got a bigger problem with what they're looking at with, with,
3997300	3998220	for some reason,
3998220	4003060	the U S Congress people wanting to write notes about the their issues in
4003060	4005100	Japan. But I mean,
4007060	4008900	some of it, they're kind of right though.
4009180	4013580	Like Sony has a choke hold on the Japanese market with Nintendo,
4013940	4015500	but when it comes to the high end gaming,
4016180	4017220	the roles are reversed.
4017220	4021180	They would not make a commitment to put those games on. They will not be like,
4021220	4024100	why would we, why are we purchasing the company if we're in, you know,
4024100	4028540	share the assets with them? No, they don't. Where's God of war.
4028980	4033740	Where's any of those games could be on Xbox. They're not, except,
4033740	4036460	I'm sorry, except MLB, the show. But that, that,
4036580	4041220	that is like legally required to be there from their agreement with MLB.
4041380	4042540	So that's the one game.
4043540	4047060	I will say it is interesting playing Minecraft dungeons on the PlayStation five
4047060	4049820	and seeing the Xbox logo come up. It's it,
4049860	4053340	there is something so weird about it. I will say.
4054060	4058140	I mean, it's just, it's, it's just really weird though. Like in this day,
4058140	4062220	like they said, like, listen, we've got, we've committed to 10 years. I mean,
4062220	4067260	yeah, like 10 years time, like time to come up with your own shooter,
4067260	4068420	then like obviously, yeah.
4069020	4071140	In 10 years, video games are going to look different.
4071140	4073140	We will have the holodeck in 10 years.
4073140	4075220	The holiday will be here in 10 years.
4075860	4079020	Probably not, but like, it'll still be like, it'll still be better,
4079020	4081620	but like at the same time. Yeah. It's just, I just,
4081620	4086180	that is just the all of you out there asking when this show will end when the
4086180	4090180	holodeck is released, the show's over because that's, that's it folks.
4090220	4095060	We we've set in the very beginning gaming is always one step closer to the
4095060	4098540	holodeck. When we get the holodeck, that's it. No LR.
4098540	4103540	It's done because we, we hit the end folks that no more hot takes.
4103540	4104380	We did it.
4111380	4114380	What do you say we end when the holodeck comes out? Sounds good.
4114380	4115380	Actually, no, what we'll do.
4115380	4119100	Someone's going to release a VR headset called the holodeck and we're like,
4119100	4119940	dang it.
4119940	4121380	O-L-R in the holodeck.
4121380	4125180	All right. Anyway, moving on.
4125180	4127060	Bonds double 06 says, but Rob,
4127060	4130020	you could be right in my bedroom every Sunday with the halo deck.
4132900	4135700	I wish I could say you're the first listener to invite me to your bedroom.
4136700	4141700	Just kidding. Just kidding. All right. Moving on.
4141700	4142700	Let's go to
4145700	4146540	the halo deck.
4147500	4149180	Or am I? Moving on.
4149180	4152260	Let's go to our next story.
4152460	4154580	Dark Sakura quickly changed the topic.
4155700	4159540	So going back to the earlier topic of the Mario movie,
4160100	4164340	there are, of course, going to be specialty soundtracks released.
4164700	4169420	You can get a two LP exclusive
4169660	4172660	with with various colors.
4172660	4176260	There is a pink and yellow and a green and red.
4176580	4179780	You can get a seven inch that just says Bowser on it.
4179780	4182900	There's a CD and a cassette.
4183060	4186620	Yes, you can get the the Super Mario
4186620	4190860	Brothers movie soundtrack on cassette for 20 bucks.
4190860	4193420	That's rad cassette.
4194180	4197380	I would only be even more like.
4199980	4203660	I don't know feeling about it if they said eight track.
4206780	4209980	But because I find the cassette thing, if that makes sense, because,
4210380	4213700	yeah, I find the cassette thing ironic because when I was a kid,
4214060	4217820	I had the Game Boy and I had my little cord from Radio Shack
4217820	4223140	that allowed me to plug that in from the Game Boy out to the mic in in my
4224340	4225420	tape deck or whatever.
4225420	4228500	And I actually make cassette tapes of Game Boy soundtracks.
4228500	4232300	Basically, I would play and let the music play in the background. So
4233220	4234740	the cassette will include.
4234740	4237380	And by the way, it is an I am a bit exclusive.
4238580	4240380	The cassette will either be red or green.
4240380	4242700	Randomly has music from the movie.
4242700	4245780	It has a song Peaches by Jack Black as Bowser
4247500	4254060	movie score, some themes by Koji Kondo, and it's shipping Q3 2023.
4254100	4258020	I I guess I shouldn't ask because this is probably a spoiler, but I'm going to.
4258020	4261820	Is that is that the president of the United States of America song from like the 90s?
4262100	4264260	Peaches? No, millions of Peaches.
4264580	4270340	Peaches for me, because I when I heard that Bowser sang a song called Peaches,
4270500	4274060	I was like, that would actually be really funny if that was something he was singing
4274060	4277860	about the princess, millions of Peaches, Peaches for free.
4280020	4283700	That song ruled whatever, whatever happened to Pusa.
4284740	4286780	Whatever happened to them, are they still around?
4287180	4290540	Did they just fade into obscurity like a lot of 90s bands?
4290540	4292860	That's sad. All right, anyway.
4293460	4294660	But what was the other?
4294660	4295660	There was another big song.
4296740	4300260	The duh duh duh duh duh duh is in my head.
4300580	4301860	That's it. That's it.
4301860	4304380	Yeah, I said, because I instantly went to the weird, weird.
4305060	4307140	I mean, that is the more recognizable version.
4307140	4310940	Yes. Oh, God.
4311700	4313100	That was all right.
4314220	4317700	Anyway, Zen Monkey 11 says, I thought they were called the dead presidents.
4317700	4320500	No, there's a dead Kennedys, but that's a very different band.
4321100	4323220	All right. Moving on.
4324540	4328820	The dead presidents was the the robbery gang from Point Break.
4329620	4332380	Oh, wow. That's that's a deep cut.
4332380	4334580	I love it. All right.
4334580	4336860	You wouldn't know how many times I saw that movie?
4336860	4338700	I'm going to say a lot.
4338700	4343500	Because I was a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan and I watched it just to see Flea.
4344540	4346460	I love that. Yeah.
4346460	4349380	Oh, my God. Fleas, Fleas probably is.
4349380	4351460	The Kennedys were both in it, and
4351460	4353220	the character shot himself in the foot.
4353220	4354260	That's what I remember.
4354260	4356700	Is Fleas in his 60s now, right?
4356700	4358500	Gotta be. I think so.
4358500	4360900	He was also in My Own Private Idaho.
4361060	4363340	Does he still play on stage in just his tighty whities
4363340	4364860	or did he finally leave that era behind?
4366380	4370460	Yes. And you know, Point Break started Kiana Reeves,
4370460	4375100	who was in John Wick number four, which was in theaters,
4375100	4378100	which I went and saw a movie in the theater.
4378260	4383060	Then they had a trailer for, you know, those classic theater,
4383260	4385100	you know, the classic movies that they play,
4385100	4388100	which had Footloose starring Kevin Bacon.
4390780	4393220	I was just about to ask, how does this tie to Kevin Bacon?
4393220	4396060	And you did it. You did it.
4396060	4397780	Also, did you know that Flea plays trumpet?
4400740	4401420	No, I didn't.
4401420	4405180	But I mean, I am not surprised at all that a lot of these like rockers
4405180	4408780	and I can't believe I'm about to call Red Hot Chili Peppers classic rock,
4408780	4410260	but maybe a little bit.
4410260	4413420	A lot of these classic rockers are actually like classically trained,
4413500	4416980	like a lot of them are like are like deeply musically trained
4416980	4418300	more than you would think.
4418300	4424380	So the lead singer of Queensryche was actually an operatic trained baritone.
4424420	4425700	Yeah. Oh, for sure.
4425700	4428060	So anyway, voice. Oh, my God.
4428900	4430340	So good. Let's move on.
4430340	4432580	Let's move on to the next story.
4432580	4434820	Nintendo issues. How about it, Loki?
4435780	4439820	Yes. So it's apparently Nintendo is now expanding
4439820	4443540	their Joy-Con repair system for the UK and Europe.
4444740	4448420	They made the statement saying Nintendo takes a great pride
4448420	4450820	in creating high quality and durable products
4450820	4453940	and is continuously making improvements to them, therefore.
4453940	4457780	And until further notice, Nintendo offers to consumers
4457780	4462220	who purchase their respective products in EEA, UK and Switzerland
4462220	4468140	that repairs for responsiveness syndrome relating to control six drift
4469380	4471420	will be conducted by Nintendo
4471420	4476180	at no official Nintendo centers at no charge.
4476860	4479900	The reason for this is actually because of
4481540	4484900	I believe the European Commission
4485180	4489300	who was asking them about their faulty stuff.
4489660	4493300	And this statement from the European Commission is full of cringe.
4493300	4495820	So just cringe warning.
4495820	4501580	Let's go. We've got news that's even better than finding a hidden one up mushroom.
4501940	4505540	We've recently contacted Nintendo to address the reoccurring
4505540	4507860	technical problems with defective switch controllers,
4508060	4511660	and we're happy to report that they've agreed to offer consumer
4511660	4516620	or all consumers the right to repair free of charge, even beyond legal guarantee.
4516820	4519300	This will prevent the disposal of unrepaired controllers
4519300	4520460	and unnecessary waste.
4520460	4521460	So don't wait.
4521460	4523780	Jump into action and get your controllers repaired for free.
4524500	4525580	Stop with the cringe thing.
4525580	4528500	It's your government entity enough.
4529620	4531460	Enough. It's bad.
4531460	4535580	It makes you look like hello, fellow kids, like just don't.
4535580	4537220	Thank you for the trigger warning on that.
4537220	4538660	I really wish I could have muted you.
4540500	4542820	That was that was terrible.
4543420	4546580	It's so bad. It's like it's just it's just awful.
4546620	4549620	Oh, all right.
4550020	4552660	Hey, at least you get to fix your your faulty controllers.
4552700	4555300	Why is this still why is this still an issue?
4555620	4558940	It's a great question, and this should really be here to you.
4559340	4562460	This should be a thing here, too, honestly.
4562460	4567180	All right, because like they yes, we understand that this happens a lot.
4567300	4569300	But where are we doing anything about it?
4569300	4571540	No, no, we're not doing anything about it.
4573540	4575660	All right. Well, let's talk about something
4575700	4577860	Nintendo won't repair, and that's your cell phone.
4578500	4581380	And honestly, they may not be making many games for it either.
4581380	4584100	It's it's hard to tell based on this statement.
4584100	4587220	But Miyamoto was doing an interview with Variety.
4587220	4589580	You know, again, this is a big Hollywood thing.
4589580	4593620	And Miyamoto said that mobile apps will not be the primary path
4593620	4595540	of future Mario games.
4595540	4598260	Probably not a huge surprise based on the performance of Dr.
4598260	4601100	Mario World, which was pulled, Super Mario Run,
4601100	4602940	which didn't quite live up to expectations.
4602940	4605540	I know it has its fans, but, you know, it didn't quite live up
4605540	4606780	to expectations.
4606780	4608980	They're saying that the strategy going forward is a, quote,
4608980	4611860	hardware and software integrated gaming experience.
4612300	4613420	What went wrong?
4613420	4618140	Well, in the interview, Miyamoto basically blames control intuitiveness,
4618660	4621260	something a lot of us were saying a long time ago.
4622020	4624820	Could have told you that before you even put the game out.
4624860	4628420	The quote here, when we explore the opportunity of making Mario
4628420	4632060	games for the mobile phone, which is a more common generic device,
4632260	4635260	it was challenging to determine what that game should be.
4635620	4638300	That is why I played the role of director for Super Mario Run
4638300	4641380	to be able to translate that Nintendo hardware experience
4641580	4643340	to the smart devices.
4643340	4647780	Very interesting little quote, because you really see Nintendo's philosophy
4647780	4651260	in there about how they make games for their hardware,
4651260	4655180	and they're going to show off their their hardware twist
4655180	4656980	or whatever in the games that they make.
4656980	4657740	That's for sure.
4657740	4661020	It's a very interesting sort of thing in that statement.
4661020	4664060	But, you know, also, we know this about Nintendo, right?
4664220	4666980	So obviously, a cell phone was not something they designed
4667340	4670700	and probably not something they particularly cared for
4670700	4673180	in making some of these games, because, you know, like we said,
4674020	4677180	you know, I'm not here to knock all cell phone games as bad.
4677180	4679700	They're not. I enjoy and play plenty of them.
4680020	4682980	But they're all designed with the limitations
4682980	4685420	and structure of a cell phone in mind.
4685420	4686820	I don't see it as much anymore.
4686820	4689420	I feel like we're past that point where we're trying to shoehorn
4689620	4692060	ports of old games into mobile phone.
4692060	4695900	I feel like that era kind of came and went and good riddance, quite frankly,
4695900	4698060	because I don't think any of those games are fun.
4698420	4702340	But things that are fun are things like, you know, Pokemon Go.
4702340	4705180	Recent controversy aside, I'm not stepping in that.
4705380	4708620	But generally, that game was designed for a mobile phone.
4708620	4710500	And a lot of the things about it is good.
4710780	4713660	Dark Sakura's word game. Sure, it's great.
4713660	4716380	It's designed for a mobile phone, you know,
4716380	4720100	or say like a Words with Friends type of thing designed for that.
4720100	4721860	You know, it's designed for that experience.
4722100	4725460	And that's why those games work out well.
4726540	4728860	Miyamoto did not comment
4728860	4731220	on any of Nintendo's other mobile properties.
4731500	4735420	Things like Animal Crossing, Pocket Camp and Fire Emblem Heroes,
4735420	4738740	which, by the way, is the top earning mobile game for Nintendo.
4738740	4742140	It crossed the one billion mark in June of last year.
4742460	4744260	So that's that.
4744260	4746900	Also in that interview, Miyamoto did not mention
4746900	4750220	when a new Mario game would arrive, and that did remind me like
4750860	4753020	very surprised
4753020	4756220	Nintendo did not put out a new Mario game to go with this movie.
4756220	4759940	Now, we saw the holiday coming up and Nintendo could announce something
4760340	4762860	in the June season or whatever for the holidays,
4763540	4768100	even if they repackage old shit, which Nintendo is not afraid to do.
4769420	4773780	I'm really surprised Nintendo doesn't have something ready to go
4774380	4776580	like now for this movie being out.
4777060	4778900	Yeah, they did.
4778900	4781220	Well, they don't because they've had opportunities
4781220	4784140	and a whole director, you know, towards the movie. Sure.
4785700	4789420	I hear rumors are supposed to be directed this week, but about Zelda.
4789420	4791460	So that'd be interesting. Yeah.
4791860	4795260	Yeah, I don't think they have a game coming anytime soon.
4796540	4799860	Looney Barn and Chat says, isn't Mario Odyssey still fairly new?
4799860	4801180	Oh, not at this point.
4801180	4803780	I'm afraid it's it was a pre pandemic.
4803780	4805940	It was a pre pandemic game to put it in perspective.
4805940	4808980	Fine. The next game, the next Mario game is probably for their new console anyway.
4808980	4811780	So it's probably being saved for that. Maybe.
4811780	4814780	I was surprised they never did a Luigi's Odyssey or a sequel to
4815180	4818060	Mario Odyssey in some capacity. I was really surprised.
4819500	4822940	Pod Culture says they will announce it in time for the video release.
4822940	4826700	Then that that that window is not what it used to be.
4826740	4830860	Pod Culture just making sure you know what that that means in the next six weeks,
4831380	4833860	because that Mario movie will be I think they've already said
4833860	4837140	it's the first week of June for on demand, isn't it?
4837300	4840100	Yeah. Like Ant-Man Quantumania is coming out pretty soon.
4840100	4841140	Like the window.
4841140	4846500	It used to be like six months to a year is now like three months, maybe. Yeah.
4847420	4850300	DJ Rama S and Chat says, as much as I love the Mario movie,
4850300	4852380	there really isn't the need for a video game tie in.
4852380	4856140	I get that. Obviously, the box office proves that I get I get that,
4856420	4861660	you know, but I'm just I'm surprised Nintendo isn't riding that wave.
4862380	4867340	With I would love a Mario game like an open world Mario game
4867340	4871500	in the vein of like a Breath of the Wild or something like that would be amazing.
4871900	4873540	I think they could do something like this.
4873540	4878500	Odyssey was kind of close, not totally, but it was more open world,
4878500	4883380	you know, a little more that Mario 64 aesthetic. But yeah, I loved Odyssey.
4883380	4886140	I loved it. I would love to see another one of those games.
4886340	4887260	And I was good.
4887260	4890220	There were those rumors sometimes ago about a Super Luigi's Odyssey.
4890260	4894140	And I'm here for that. Like, I really wish that was true, but we'll see.
4894620	4896860	So, yeah. All right.
4897460	4900420	Well, we'll have to go back to a simple time for now, though,
4900420	4902940	in our next segment. So let's get to it.
4913380	4916300	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time,
4916460	4920740	or I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4921140	4923860	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4924460	4926460	And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?
4927940	4930940	I picked Stryker's 1945.
4933060	4937660	It was also known as Stryker 1945, but everywhere else it was Stryker's,
4937660	4940900	plural. It is a vertical
4941940	4943820	scrolling shooter.
4943820	4948740	It was developed by Saikyo in 1995.
4949140	4954340	In Japan, it came out on PlayStation and Sega Saturn by Atlas in 1996
4954700	4958860	and also released as part of the Saikyo Shooting Collection.
4958860	4964820	Volume one Stryker's 1945 1 and 2 by Taito for PlayStation 2.
4965100	4970300	In Europe, it came out under Playit as 1945 1 and 2, the arcade games.
4970780	4974620	There was the sequel Stryker's 1945 in 1997
4975140	4978860	that in North America just came out as Stryker's 1945.
4979100	4983540	And then Stryker's 1945 3 in 1999, which was
4984100	4988620	and there was a second title remake called Stryker's 1945 Plus.
4989220	4993660	So also more recently in 2022,
4993660	4997500	the original arcade version was included in the Sega Astro City mini
5000540	5001660	So there you go.
5001660	5008460	Anyway, you play as one of several planes
5009020	5011300	and each of them has three attacks.
5011300	5013620	There's a normal shot, a charged shot and a bomb.
5013820	5016540	It clears out the enemy and the bullets.
5016540	5019900	Normal and charged shots can be strengthened by different power ups
5019900	5021740	and gold bombs.
5021740	5025340	You can get gold bars for bonus points.
5025620	5029460	And when you defeat the final boss, your time, the number of gold bars,
5029460	5031740	the number of enemies killed are added up for each level.
5032020	5034700	And if it's high enough, you get a silver or gold medal.
5035140	5040340	In the Japanese arcade version, there is a hidden post credit bonus
5040820	5044980	that can be unlocked if you beat the entire game without losing a life.
5045460	5048740	And it shows all six of the pilots,
5049100	5053940	which are five women and one man posing undressed.
5055780	5057260	Go Fig.
5057300	5062300	But anyway, it's set in the summer of 1945 after World War Two.
5063540	5068060	The world is in that sort of post-war piece.
5068580	5072620	And then an organization called CANNY, C-A-N-Y,
5073500	5075940	wants to take over the world with super weapons.
5075940	5082660	And so. The the I guess it's the United Military
5083220	5087260	is sending out people to go stop the bad guys.
5088420	5092420	So, yeah, I mean, fairly simple, as you can see on the screen,
5092420	5097140	those who are watching on Twitch, it's it's a shooter game.
5097620	5100940	You play a plane, but it's it's still considered
5100940	5105700	to be one of the most successful shooter games.
5106420	5110540	In fact, in Japan, as of Game Machine's
5111100	5114820	July 15th 1995 issue, it was considered the fourth most successful
5114820	5116820	arcade game of the month.
5117140	5119540	The Saturn version was highly lauded
5120300	5123860	as a 92 out of 100 for its review.
5124620	5127060	So there we go.
5127060	5128100	Picked a quick one.
5128100	5131820	If you want to know who was behind it, first of all.
5131820	5137500	The director of the game was Yorichika Naozumi.
5139260	5143500	It was developed by, like I said, by Psycho.
5143500	5146820	There also is an iOS Android version by KMBox
5147180	5150020	and a window version by City Connection.
5150780	5153980	And I'll tell you what made me think of this is when I was going to pick up
5153980	5156700	Osmond is that I saw they had two
5156900	5160660	Psycho collections coming up for Switch are already out.
5161180	5163300	And so I thought, why not?
5163300	5164420	It's a fun one.
5164420	5166900	It's a really great game and it's a two player game.
5166900	5170740	But it was released on Psycho's first generation arcade system.
5171460	5174980	Now, before we wrap up, because I and I apologize,
5174980	5177780	I stepped out to do a bio break, as I usually do right about now.
5177780	5183460	But I don't think this has no relation to Capcom's 1940 X series, right?
5184140	5187180	No, this is a completely different company.
5187220	5190300	Yeah, yeah. I mean, that was it's interesting to me because
5191060	5194820	it has that like element, obviously, if they're both World War Two games.
5194820	5197220	Right. But I definitely get that whole like, oh, this feels like a
5197500	5201100	maybe the word would be spiritual successor by fans or something.
5201100	5202420	You know, I don't know what else to call it.
5203300	5207940	Don't. When did 19 1943 come out?
5207940	5211380	Oh, the first game was like 1984 is very old.
5211660	5216660	This this is I'm not even going to call it.
5216980	5221540	Yeah, actually, Orange Wright just just nailed it similar to Aero Fighters.
5221620	5227700	OK, the but I mean, it's easy to look at a playing game
5227700	5232020	set in the 40s and say that it's related.
5234220	5238820	I actually think that this game, it's a pretty fun shooter.
5238820	5241060	Of course, I'm no good at it because I suck at shooters,
5241660	5244940	but it has a lot of challenge and, you know,
5245260	5246820	some pretty good music in it.
5246820	5250060	And it's just a really tight game.
5250500	5253660	I mean, I have played an original of it.
5253660	5257140	And is the arcade version just so clean?
5257140	5260260	Of course, if you want the best at home version, you get it on Saturn.
5261260	5262380	All right. There it is.
5262380	5265500	Your classic game of the week, Strikers, 1945.
5265500	5267900	Admittedly, not one I was super familiar with.
5267900	5270100	So I learned something.
5271140	5274620	I always thought, though, that the company's psycho, that their name was so funny.
5274980	5277820	Because not necessarily spelled that way.
5277820	5281580	There's this P S I K Y O, but the word psycho means the greatest.
5282860	5285260	So, yeah. All right.
5286220	5290420	Well, we were going to get into some more rapid fire news,
5290420	5292260	but it looks like Loki stepped away for a minute.
5292260	5295420	So I guess I got to buy some time.
5295740	5298100	That's OK. You know, I'll get mine out of the way.
5298220	5299860	Usually that segment goes a little longer.
5299860	5300980	Sure. We'll start with Dark Sakura.
5300980	5303580	We'll get into some rapid fire news special.
5303580	5304900	We'll start with you. Sure.
5305380	5308180	All right. Well, you know, we were all up in arms
5308180	5311220	about trying to get the eShop stuff done.
5311220	5315660	But Pokemon Stadium being one of the first Pokemon spinoff games
5315660	5319660	is actually coming to Switch owners via the Switch online
5319660	5324620	plus expansion pack subscription service starting on April 12th,
5325780	5328020	which is this upcoming Friday.
5328020	5332620	And it will be accessible via the Nintendo 64 app
5333460	5335700	with, you know, if you've got the subscription,
5335700	5338980	all you have to do is update the app next week and you can pick it up.
5341020	5343580	Nice. All right.
5343940	5348420	I yeah, I might have to I still not am not on the extended
5348420	5352980	Nintendo thing with expansion pack, whatever it's called, but Pokemon Stadium.
5353900	5356460	That's one that's tempting to get it for. All right.
5357220	5360300	Loki, let's go to your rapid fire news stories now that you're settled back in.
5360980	5364940	Yeah. So the murder of Sonic had a murder of Sonic,
5364940	5368020	the hedgehog game that came out last week for April Fools
5368020	5370860	has actually surpassed one million downloads.
5371300	5375540	It's one of the highest rated Sonic games on Steam right now.
5376740	5381100	And the number 61 highest rated game on Steam of all time.
5382340	5384700	Pretty unexpected, I think.
5384700	5388700	So really unexpected happens all the time.
5389300	5392300	I mean, it's how we got how to full boyfriend.
5392300	5395420	I mean, I don't think Sega expected that it would be this popular,
5395420	5397500	but yeah, it's pretty cool.
5397500	5403180	And then the Final Fantasy pixel remaster PlayStation four and switch.
5404060	5406900	They have a release date of April 19th
5407380	5410260	and they will include my birthday.
5410820	5415420	Yes. And they will include a new font setting as well.
5415860	5422300	New fonts. And I think there was an intro credits or something like that.
5424780	5428220	All right. Well, I got one more story for you,
5428220	5432100	and it has to do with Overwatch or specifically Overwatch two.
5432100	5434220	I'm not sure how many of you are playing Overwatch two,
5434420	5438660	but we have the announcement of a new hero for Overwatch two, who is Life Weaver,
5438940	5442260	a Thai scientist who has long hair
5442260	5445300	and a sense of style, confidence and bravado.
5445660	5447780	And you see him in the trailer.
5447780	5451020	He uses plant themed powers to restore health.
5451020	5453780	And also, I guess he can like lift people up with a flower petal.
5454020	5456300	It's kind of like a thing that he uses as well.
5456660	5461220	Also important to point out, Life Weaver is in the game's lore pansexual.
5461500	5465700	So as the first pan character, I guess openly pan character in the game,
5465860	5471020	although I swear some voice interactions from chatting was was farmed with Batiste
5471700	5474940	and it sounded like the two of them were flirting in the little
5476060	5477660	dialogue that was going back and forth.
5477660	5480220	So, you know, that's cool.
5480220	5484740	I mean, I guess my point is, is that like if you're really upset about gay beer,
5484940	5488220	then wait until I tell you that in Overwatch, everybody is gay.
5489140	5489940	And that's a fact.
5491580	5494420	All right. But check out Life Weaver coming out soon to the game.
5494420	5496100	Actually, it does look like a cool mechanic.
5496100	5500060	I wish I was better at Overwatch two, but I'm not.
5500780	5503420	All right. Let's travel around the world.
5503420	5506460	I still refuse to touch anything from Activision
5506460	5508900	until after the merger goes through. Yeah.
5510420	5512700	I can't because Diablo, but also
5513740	5515820	just, well, and I think I've talked about this before,
5515820	5518060	hearing from some people that are on the inside.
5518580	5521340	I've heard about some of the tangible changes that are happening.
5521620	5524860	So it's nice to see that they are making changes.
5525100	5528500	But yes, I am a matter of principle because of a certain somebody.
5528540	5530020	Sure, I understand.
5530020	5533420	All right. Well, moving on, let's travel around the world
5533420	5536060	and check out some stuff that's coming out a little sooner.
5536540	5537860	World release dates.
5537860	5540180	Loki, we'll start with you in the U.S. and what's coming out here.
5540860	5545180	We have the process of elimination on PlayStation four, Nintendo Switch,

5575940	5579220	Legacy Collection on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.
5580780	5584780	All right. Traveling to Japan, I seem to remember last week was pretty
5585300	5587700	and there wasn't a lot, but this week we have some releases again.
5587700	5591460	So on the 13th, on the Nintendo Switch, we have Osmond coming in.
5592100	5594660	I think this is is this the one that you ordered, Dark Sakura?
5594660	5596260	Yes, it absolutely is.
5596260	5598500	So, OK, so that's coming out in Japan this week.
5599140	5602100	There's a special there's a regular and a special edition.
5602100	5604740	So I don't know if this is the special edition has like
5604740	5607860	a really long poster and an art book and some stuff.
5607860	5611860	It's it's like it's like 60 bucks.
5611860	5614940	And then the the standard one's like 30.
5615380	5617540	It wasn't very expensive. Hmm.
5617540	5620660	I was just taking a peek here, showing folks what that might look like there.
5620660	5623700	For those that are watching a twitch.tv slash vog network.
5623940	5625420	That's also out on PlayStation four.
5625420	5628500	I should point out as well as the switch, of course.
5628540	5629820	I ordered the Switch one.
5629820	5631540	Yeah. All right.
5631540	5634140	Some other games coming out this week on the Switch include
5634140	5636780	a Senju no Waltz for the Nintendo Switch.
5636780	5638820	There's a regular and a special edition for that.
5639580	5643700	There's also Castle of Shikigami 2 comes out this week from Konami.
5644300	5648620	Dokapon Kingdom Connect is out this week, as is Aiden Chronicle Rising
5649340	5651660	is released over there as well this week.
5651940	5656540	And Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection is also out in Japan this week
5656820	5658500	as it makes its way to the US as well.
5658500	5660060	That is everything on the switch.
5660060	5663900	But quickly, looking at the PlayStation five, we also have Atomic Heart
5664140	5666780	in regular and limited edition, making its way out
5667260	5669620	for the PlayStation five this week.
5670020	5672140	And that's it.
5672180	5674820	Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.
5675740	5679420	Only two things on the list on the 13th for
5680340	5682180	I guess this is computer.
5682180	5686020	It's X-Plane 12, but I have no idea what that is.
5686020	5687260	It's a flight simulator.
5687260	5690780	And then on the 14th for PlayStation Switch, we have Cult of the Lamb.
5691420	5692420	Oh, cool.
5693100	5694820	That's going to be my palate cleanser.
5694820	5699620	It's here in my my my subathon because I fucking love that game.
5699620	5701380	It's so great.
5701540	5704060	All right. I have the soundtrack on vinyl.
5704060	5705940	Oh, fun. Yeah.
5705940	5707260	And I'm supposed to be.
5707260	5710140	I didn't I don't remember if I ordered the plushie.
5710340	5712900	No, I didn't order the plushie, but I got the soundtrack.
5713020	5715100	I need to get a record player. That would be fun.
5715100	5717660	But then I'm like a record player to play all these damn records.
5717700	5720220	I don't need another thing to spend more money on. All right.
5721380	5723340	You can get a good one for not very expensive.
5723340	5725940	I know. Then that opens the door to vinyl collection.
5725940	5727380	That's the problem.
5727380	5731540	I I've been collecting vinyl without having a record player, Rob.
5731740	5733580	I have I have records already.
5733580	5737100	I know I have two, two records, two records, both of them.
5738260	5740900	And one of them I got you and the other one I bought in Seattle.
5741620	5743900	Yep. The other one I bought in Seattle.
5743900	5748420	I still wish that I had bought the Wendy Carlos album.
5748660	5751260	The only reason I didn't buy it was because it had been published
5751260	5752980	under her dead name. Mm hmm.
5752980	5755100	But I still wish I had.
5755100	5758860	I would I would kill for a first printing of Switched on Bach.
5759340	5761140	Yeah, I would. You should.
5761140	5764220	I mean, not that you're going to be in Seattle anytime soon, but if you are,
5764220	5767420	there was an awesome record store at the Pike Market that I went to
5767420	5769700	that would probably have it, you know.
5769700	5772220	So if you're still interested in finding that, so.
5772900	5777340	There's a good place in Oakland that's near the the where the the park
5777340	5779940	where they have the farmer's market, I could go buy two.
5780940	5782940	But that's where I got
5783940	5788260	my my Xanadu soundtrack on vinyl.
5789100	5792860	I actually do not know the name that that album would have been published under.
5792860	5796060	Don't. But same last name.
5796060	5798500	Yeah, OK. It would have been OK.
5798500	5800980	So as long as I know the last name and the name of the album, I could find it.
5801020	5805820	So if I'm ever in Seattle again, I may I may actually go to Seattle.
5805820	5807740	There's a big Ingers thing up there in September,
5807740	5810100	but it's literally the week after Dragon Con.
5810900	5813780	But I have enough, I've been on so many flights,
5813780	5817300	I have enough frequent flyer points to like have a trip to Seattle.
5817300	5818660	I might do it. We'll see.
5818660	5820100	Take me with you.
5820100	5822740	Alan will be pissed if I go without him because we have friends up there.
5822740	5824740	So I don't know. I don't know. We'll see.
5824740	5825780	All right. All right.
5825780	5827740	Well, I sent you the the the name.
5827740	5830220	OK. All right. Moving on.
5830220	5834340	Let's check out our next story here.
5834340	5836100	Loki. Yep.
5836100	5837660	So we're starting to get news
5837660	5840860	of other non E3 events that are going to be happening.
5840860	5845780	So Gamescom opening night live 2023 has been confirmed
5846100	5851420	by Jeff Keighley to be returning August 22nd.
5851940	5855460	And of course, that's going to be taking place in
5856140	5859060	Kondamesi, Germany.
5859060	5861860	He's busy. Yep, he's busy.
5862380	5864180	So that'd be cool. I can't wait to see that.
5864180	5867060	He has to replace E3 and open Gamescom.
5867060	5869300	That's that's busy. Does he sleep?
5870940	5873260	I don't know. No, he doesn't.
5873260	5877820	And then, of course, I sometimes I wonder all dozens of you,
5877820	5882900	I'm sure excited to hear that the PC gaming show is coming back June 11th.
5883340	5883980	So that's right.
5883980	5888060	We're going to be able to see some PC game titles, I guess
5888980	5891580	hosted by Sean Plot.
5891900	5895940	Well, could I actually I have a wild theory.
5896020	5900500	Could the absence of E3 and some of these other pomp and circumstance
5900500	5902540	actually make this show better?
5902980	5906420	No, because last year they didn't have E3 and it was not good.
5906420	5909180	So I don't think so. Fair.
5910980	5913260	Got shut me up. All right.
5913260	5915340	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
5916900	5919620	Well, it is it is some sad news.
5919620	5923860	It was announced that American McGee's
5924900	5927060	works at trying to make a third installment
5927460	5930020	of the Alice series is quote at an end.
5931060	5935140	There was a statement on on McGee's Patreon
5935140	5938580	that said that he had, and this is the quote,
5938860	5941940	exhausted every option for getting a new Alice game made
5942340	5946380	after EA reportedly decided to pass on the project
5946780	5949420	based on an internal analysis of the IP market
5949820	5953220	market conditions and details of the production proposal.
5956220	5960060	So he he's I mean, basically, they're like
5960420	5963780	they talked with EA about the efforts to get the new game
5965180	5969220	and were presented with the design Bible and production plan.
5969780	5974140	And it had the the schedule, the budget, the team, the design for everything.
5974700	5980100	EA reviewed it and came back denying the licensing for Alice Asylum.
5982100	5983980	So they are are passing it on.
5986500	5987820	Well, that's a bummer.
5987820	5990780	Yeah, they have a really, really good series. Yeah.
5991980	5995260	I don't I feel like that can't be gone forever,
5995260	5998500	but it's going to be a while for sure. So.
6000020	6003580	All right. Moving on to news that is also frustrating.
6003580	6007100	Loki. Yes.
6007140	6011820	So Monster Energy is a very litigious company
6011820	6013900	and has a monster legal department.
6014380	6018580	They attack anybody that uses the word monster,
6018580	6021780	especially if they're defenseless indie developers.
6022100	6023860	And so that's what they've done here.
6023860	6027700	They have basically gone after glowstick entertainment's
6027700	6031860	2020 game, Dark Deception, Monsters and Mortals,
6031860	6034260	because I know the first thing I hear
6034620	6038580	or think of when I hear that is their energy drink, of course.
6039980	6041700	You mean they're nasty canopies?
6041700	6044340	What are these? What are they going to do? Sue Halloween?
6044380	6044940	Like, I don't.
6044940	6047740	Are they going to sue the Spirit Store for selling monster costumes?
6047740	6050140	I tried suing a lot of people.
6050660	6051940	Get over it.
6051940	6056660	They should have to pay for all these fucking terrible lawsuits.
6056740	6059780	I mean, if somebody is putting out a drink named Monster, then fine.
6059780	6062420	You're with the word monster and then find that never been.
6062500	6065340	Well, they should they should never hurt their fucking IP.
6065500	6069820	Well, they should never have let them have Monster as a trademark.
6069860	6072460	Monster Energy should be a trademark.
6072460	6075100	But Monster itself should have a generic for that.
6075380	6079420	But of course, our our copyright and trademark system is broken.
6079420	6082740	And so because of that, you have people like Monster,
6082980	6085380	you know, registering that as a trademark.
6085740	6089540	And you have to say, did they sue Lady Gaga?
6089620	6092420	She ate my heart, doo doo doo doo.
6092940	6094220	Well, I mean, her little monsters.
6094220	6095780	That boy is a monster.
6095780	6097900	She has a song called Monster.
6097900	6100820	Yeah, it'd be different if like this thing was like,
6102660	6106180	you know, like Monster Energy, something or other like it was the name of the game.
6106260	6107300	Then I would understand.
6107300	6110020	But this is just completely ridiculous.
6110020	6111540	And then on top of that, you know.
6111540	6116460	Sorry, Marissa Chat says Monster was the employment website for old people like me.
6116460	6118260	Oh, my God. True. That's right.
6118300	6120940	There was a monster was like the yeah.
6121740	6122980	Monster.com. Yeah.
6122980	6125780	No, no, I'm older than you.
6127500	6129020	Please do not. Please do not.
6129020	6132580	Yeah. We're old enough to remember when you found a job in the paper.
6133700	6135900	And Monster.com.
6135900	6139140	They also filed a lawsuit with at one time.
6140580	6144140	They they filed lawsuits against, you know, lots of different things.
6144140	6148860	Everything from like restaurants to websites, the forums, the games to.
6148860	6153460	I think they even tried to maybe sue Disney or Pixar about Monsters Inc.
6153860	6157980	But, you know, for some reason, they're still around suing people.
6157980	6161980	So, of course, you know, they've basically
6161980	6164620	been giving an agreement or whatever it says.
6165260	6170020	The overreaching settlement terms that Monster Energy sent the company
6170020	6172900	was basically demands in exchange for allowing us to use the name
6173140	6174380	Monsters and Mortals.
6174380	6179700	We never we agree never to name any other game, any variation of the word monster.
6180620	6184260	Also, it forces us to never use a green and white logo
6184260	6186900	on black background for any game we ever make.
6187100	6190220	So they're saying that they own those colors, too, apparently.
6191780	6194620	They can they can trademark a color
6195300	6197820	like Barbie Pink is is owned by Mattel.
6198380	6202100	OK, but I don't think that they say that they can't make a game,
6202100	6206020	even if it's not named Monster, that they can't make a game with those colors.
6206380	6207740	Like their logo.
6207740	6210260	I just think that's overreaching.
6210260	6214340	So it's just all companies like Monster Energy depend on doing their bullying
6214340	6219300	and secret while presenting a clean image to their base athletes and gamers.
6219660	6222660	Showing their true face publicly is the only way to stop them.
6222660	6226660	And unfortunately, it won't be because they will, you know, do it.
6226980	6231060	But apparently the CEO of glow sick entertainment says they've filed
6231060	6234060	for summary of judgment to hopefully move the thing along.
6234060	6236060	So it's not being dragged out legally.
6236060	6238940	They need somebody needs to counter Sue to get them
6238940	6241180	to lose that trademark because it can happen.
6243020	6247220	I mean, honestly, there's Monster Energy than Monster Cables at one time.
6247380	6248100	Like, yeah, I'm right.
6248100	6250820	And Monster Cables used to sue everybody as well.
6250860	6254020	I would like to see a battle between Monster Cable and Monster Energy,
6254380	6259860	you know, and then just just get rid of like nullify the trademark.
6259900	6263420	Nintendo needs to release a game called Monster, and then they can all fuck off
6263420	6266140	together into eternal legal.
6270140	6273940	I'm surprised that they did end up suing Pixar or whatever for Monsters, Inc.
6273940	6275620	that they didn't like get shut down.
6275620	6276820	I'm kind of surprised.
6276820	6279900	Yeah, the Disney Disney lawyers are scary, too.
6279900	6284020	And I'm kind of surprised they will eat them up better about death.
6284060	6285660	Deft is saying Pokemon.
6285660	6287740	They went after Pokemon pocket monsters.
6288020	6289780	Are you shitting me?
6290340	6291900	How do they still have the I don't know.
6291900	6294820	Anyway, energy drinks aren't good for you.
6294820	6299220	I say I say as I literally down an entire coffee on this program.
6300220	6301900	Coffee is not an energy drink.
6301900	6303140	No, it's not. Yeah.
6303140	6305580	Is the is right is the energy drink.
6305660	6308540	The only one I accept.
6308540	6310780	I don't drink. I've been buying coffee on Etsy, by the way.
6310780	6312860	I don't drink that other shit because of coffee.
6312860	6314100	Just pointing out. All right.
6315780	6319180	I I put my faith in coffee, which sustains me. Mm hmm.
6319820	6321340	All right. Thank you, Chad.
6321340	6323620	Chad is backing me up. Chad is backing me up.
6323620	6324860	I appreciate you all.
6324860	6326500	Rob Coffee.
6326500	6328820	Tiger Claw in chat says, is it decaf?
6328820	6330660	Don't insult me.
6331900	6332900	I'm just kidding.
6332900	6334100	No, it is not decaf.
6334100	6336060	I've I've been a little detour.
6336060	6339860	I've been stepping up my coffee game and I ordered blue mountain coffee
6339860	6343980	on Etsy and Kona coffee for in K cups.
6345020	6347260	And it's delightful.
6347260	6350180	And it supports small roasters.
6350180	6354420	And it's a little bit more expensive, but you get some damn fine coffee.
6354820	6358780	I do drink decaf once in a great while, but like late at night,
6358780	6361580	like eight o'clock, like that's late.
6361780	6363060	Eight is late.
6363060	6365260	Well, like relative to bedtime. Yes.
6366660	6371020	No, I keep decaf on hand for when Becky comes over
6371860	6375420	like to make half calves. Yeah.
6375420	6377980	And I will do a decaf
6377980	6381540	if I'm cold and it's like midnight.
6383140	6386940	But I also buy good decaf and not shitty decaf.
6389780	6391060	Yeah. You know what?
6391060	6391980	I don't like.
6391980	6394820	OK, first of all, I saw Rhonda's thing.
6394820	6397300	We have Keurig's at work, so I buy boxes of variety K cups.
6397980	6400620	I do not like the Dunkin K cups and I do not like Starbucks
6400620	6405460	regular coffee at all because it tastes burnt or dead.
6406580	6408380	I do like their espresso drinks,
6408380	6412700	but I must say that I am very, very fond of their iced coffee.
6414500	6417820	I've been getting what's that one brand?
6417820	6419260	Is it Green Mountain?
6419260	6420780	Not that they endorse this or anything.
6420780	6423580	I think that that's the same company as Keurig.
6423780	6425740	So it's it's their own company, coffee company.
6425900	6429620	But I like the Green Mountain and Gevalia,
6429820	6434180	the Swiss company and donut shop.
6434660	6436260	My favorite. Not that they're paying me.
6436260	6437580	And I don't remember the exact name.
6437580	6440780	I just know it's the Hawaiian coffee and it comes in the foil bag
6440780	6442900	and the K cups are a little more recyclable.
6442900	6445300	That is like they have like macadamia nut.
6445780	6448300	That is the best. It's like Kona or something.
6448860	6451820	That is by far the best one. Yeah. For me.
6452700	6456700	Well, at any at any rate, though, I fucking love coffee.
6457500	6460540	I like that my I like that my palate,
6460540	6463620	because I've been drinking less of it because of my stomach.
6464820	6468100	That I've like begun like actually tasting the different flavors
6468100	6470460	and like I'm becoming a bit of a coffee snob.
6471220	6472860	I hear you the other day.
6472860	6477500	So Friday, I know that I have told many people that
6477660	6481580	that they overroast their coffee to make them last longer Friday,
6481580	6485060	which was the start of the third day of deliberations in our trial.
6485500	6489060	I got a Starbucks that morning and then at lunch.
6489100	6490820	Well, we didn't know if we would be done or not yet.
6490820	6492900	I also had a Dutch brothers at lunch.
6493180	6497660	I had two designer coffees on Friday because it was that kind of day.
6500460	6502140	Did I deserve it? Yes, I did.
6502140	6504100	Every every last drop. Yes, I did.
6505100	6508100	To coffee lounge radio.
6508100	6510180	I love coffee. All right.
6510180	6513540	You know, it's even better than you know, it's better than any of this stuff
6513540	6515700	is going to is gay brunch.
6515700	6517740	No gay brunch. A French press.
6518580	6521140	That is the best coffee in there.
6521140	6524060	No, like, no, it's just no actual fresh fresh.
6524100	6526140	Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6526140	6528580	Yeah. Clever, clever drip is better than French press.
6528620	6531340	Oh, I will fight you on this
6531340	6532620	on immersion.
6532620	6533740	I'll drink any coffee.
6533740	6535660	I'll drink any coffee except Folgers.
6535660	6537540	Otherwise, I'll drink any coffee.
6538180	6539580	Phil's coffee.
6539580	6541380	You and I are going to love Phil's.
6541380	6544340	I love Phil's. There's one downtown.
6544340	6545780	Yeah, that's it.
6545780	6548900	We're doing brunch next Sunday.
6548940	6551140	They finally they finally opened
6551500	6555860	the new place under what used to be sidetracks downtown.
6556820	6557460	That's fine.
6557460	6559820	It's going to make the hamburgers.
6559820	6564380	It is it's a burger place, but it's I think if they don't do a drag
6564380	6566940	queen brunch and they're in the wrong part of fucking town,
6566940	6568700	that is all I know.
6568700	6570380	All right, Rob, we're going to brunch.
6570380	6572540	All right. Sounds good. Let's do it.
6572540	6575900	All right. Moving on one more thing.
6577460	6580420	I don't know how to tie this into brunch, so I'm just not going to bother trying.
6580620	6584220	But what could the future of PlayStation controllers look like?
6584620	6588100	Could they actually change temperature?
6588300	6591220	Yep. It's a new patent that Sony has filed
6591220	6593700	that talks about how this technology would work.
6594020	6597260	It would have a elastic member on the controller.
6597860	6601300	The elastic could actually change shape, and that's something
6601300	6603220	that could happen as well.
6603220	6605780	And then also there would be a sensor that would talk about
6605780	6608460	if the elastic is touched, twisted, pressed, pinched,
6608460	6611780	washed or rub and measure things like acceleration.
6612500	6617460	But then also as a part of this, the elastic piece has vibration capabilities
6617460	6621940	and this intensity could actually cause the controller to heat up.
6621940	6625860	So the gel material in the elastic could actually change and heat up
6626140	6627700	and make it more firm.
6627700	6629980	So it could be interesting if you're in like a volcano level
6629980	6631580	at a type of game or something like that,
6631580	6633940	where the controller could actually get hotter.
6634340	6636940	That would be interesting. It sounds like a safety nightmare.
6637260	6641500	But children, well, sometimes all you need
6642500	6644740	is the power of suggestion, right?
6644740	6647900	Like take a take a ride like Star Tours,
6648060	6650660	even though sometimes it feels like you're moving like this.
6651620	6655100	When you actually write, it's very subtle movements on Star Tours,
6655100	6660340	but watching the screen and if you are a really real Disney freak,
6660340	6663100	like some of us used to be, at least anyway here on OLR,
6663500	6666140	try riding the ride with your eyes closed sometime
6666140	6668180	and you'll feel just how subtle the movements are.
6668660	6671460	Because when you're watching the screen, though,
6671460	6675060	you feel like you're like completely into it.
6675300	6677820	And I would say this is the same thing with the temperature change.
6677820	6682420	It only has to go up a little hotter to really get that impression of heat.
6683340	6686580	I remember the old pinball table Whirlwind.
6686820	6688340	I think it was what was called, right?
6688340	6689420	Yeah, Whirlwind had the fan on it.
6689420	6690940	Had the fan on it.
6690940	6693740	And like, it's just this tiny ass shitty little fan.
6693740	6696820	But when it blows air on you, you know, you're kind of like,
6696980	6698980	and she, uh oh, looks like rain.
6699260	6701220	And you say, oh, there's a storm coming.
6701220	6704660	So when they had
6705660	6707660	not California Extreme, but
6707660	6711460	and not Golden, because Golden State Pinball Festival is coming up next month.
6712580	6715100	But the other one, the Pinna-Go-Go, thank you.
6715940	6718580	When they had that in Dixon in that, you know,
6719540	6722540	non air conditioned place
6722540	6726300	with all the corn pollen everywhere, which is why I don't do that one anymore.
6727580	6730100	There'd be a line around Whirlwind when it got hot.
6730100	6735020	Because you just want that fan blowing at you the whole time.
6735020	6736740	Yeah, for sure.
6736740	6739020	Yeah, we used to have a Whirlwind.
6739020	6742340	All right. Well, that was our last slotted story for tonight.
6742340	6744260	So it's time for the listener roundtable.
6744260	6748460	We're going to open up and for your emails, participate at orange.ontrady.com.
6748660	6752660	But we also welcome your phone calls on our Discord server, vog.network.com.
6752660	6755060	That's vognetwork.com slash discord.

6761500	6763340	Also, I will. Well, let me check.
6763340	6765980	I don't think we had emails tonight, but I'm going to check in anyway,
6765980	6768140	just as I always do. We had spam.
6768140	6768980	Well, that doesn't count.
6768980	6771220	I mean, I'll refresh it right now and see.
6771220	6774420	But nope, nothing in there but the dust bunnies.
6774420	6775980	We ain't got shit. All right.
6775980	6777980	Participate at orange.ontrady.com
6777980	6780700	if you would like to put something in our box for next week.
6781500	6785580	SSG100Matt says, what was the snowmobile game that was like Hydro Thunder
6785780	6787820	that had a cooling fans during gameplay?
6787820	6789460	Yeah, it was Arctic Thunder, wasn't it?
6789460	6791780	Mm hmm. Yeah, I think it was.
6791780	6794300	It was Arctic Thunder logical.
6794300	6796780	Let me see. I thought that they were missing an opportunity
6796780	6800780	not having like a big ass fan unit on Alpine Racer.
6801860	6804140	Oh, yeah. Oh, that's a throwback.
6805060	6809420	All right. Let's go quickly over to Loki with some last minute stories,
6809420	6813180	and I actually see at least one question in chat here for a discussion topic.
6813180	6814300	I'll get to that in a moment.
6814300	6817300	But Loki, do you have any last minute stories you want to get to?
6817300	6821420	Just a screenshot, a little bit of footage from what appears to be
6821420	6825100	like an internal video from, I believe,
6826380	6831460	Sega. It's showing a remake of Jet Set Radio
6831980	6835340	and also a remake of Persona three,
6835620	6839940	which apparently someone says that also the website
6839940	6842180	for the persona three remake has been
6843180	6844340	registered as well.
6844340	6846220	So maybe that coming soon.
6846220	6848780	But the the video, at least a little bit of animation
6848780	6852420	they had for the Jet Set Radio remake looks awesome.
6853740	6854740	All right.
6855580	6859060	Mike Deft in our chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network
6859060	6862660	asks, we're heading towards the it's off the screen.
6862660	6866100	Sorry, we're heading towards the end of the first quarter of the year.
6866420	6870980	What's the game or games you've liked the most so far this year?
6871860	6872860	Good question.
6873580	6876660	For me, Diablo four, which is kind of cheating
6876660	6878780	because that game hasn't actually come out yet.
6878780	6882780	But y'all know those games are my jam and the beta did happen.
6882780	6886420	And so I already know this is going to be a game that is definitely up my alley.
6886700	6891020	Otherwise, to give another maybe a better answer, I don't know,
6891020	6893740	for lack of better term for your question, I would say maybe Hi-Fi Rush
6893740	6896180	would probably be the game for a lot of people on their list,
6896180	6898500	which, of course, was the surprise rhythm game
6899020	6901700	action game release that was released
6901700	6905260	by the folks that used to do the Evil Within and those games.
6905260	6908820	That was the stealth game pass release that came out a couple of months ago.
6908820	6912540	I would bet Hi-Fi Rush is probably going to end up on a lot of people's lists
6912540	6915020	if you would ask that same question.
6915020	6917620	Dark Soccer, Loki, anything you'd want to add to that for like
6918220	6921420	great games so far this year?
6921420	6923780	No, because I really haven't played anything new.
6924340	6925340	I played my inbox.
6925340	6928220	Still catching up from last year, which is fair.
6928260	6928820	So what happens?
6928820	6931580	I like playing my Midnight Suns, and that makes me happy.
6932060	6934940	So, oh, my God, how did I forget theater them?
6936060	6938340	How did I forget theater them?
6938340	6942060	Because it's always so much in your brain that you think of it all the time,
6942060	6943740	and so you become desensitized.
6943740	6947020	Yes. Correct answer. Yes.
6947020	6948460	I'm I don't know.
6948460	6952060	I haven't played any new games this year, so I'm just going to,
6952060	6954060	because I was scrolling through Twitter
6954060	6958140	and this happens to be the game that's shown in front of me here.
6958140	6960260	I'm going to say paparazzi.
6960260	6964500	It is a game where you take pictures of dogs wearing hats and glasses.
6965140	6967420	I saw that. I was like, what the hell is this?
6967700	6969700	Looks great. All right.
6971140	6972620	I'm going to.
6972620	6976020	So we had a redeemed post show shout out in our chat.
6976020	6979460	I'm going to upgrade that to an on show shout out for free on the house.
6980100	6984020	Marissa said, I need more social media followers for my voice acting work.
6984260	6985540	Anyone want to follow?
6985540	6987820	I'm at Marissa Meisel everywhere.
6987820	6992820	Thanks. That's M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.
6992820	6994620	Here it is. Get your pen ready one more time.
6994620	6998620	M-A-R-I-S-S-A M-E-I-Z-E-L.
6998620	7003740	Hit that 30 seconds backward button if you missed it and give Marissa all the follows.
7005100	7007260	Because I would love to see Marissa get more.
7007260	7009340	I mean, she's already done some great voice acting work.
7009340	7011620	I would love to see her get some of the big gigs.
7011820	7015220	I want to see Marissa retire to a life of convention circuits
7015580	7017180	like all the big voice actors.
7017180	7019500	Marissa deserves that and more so.
7020580	7025020	All right. Anyway, all right, well, I think I think, believe it or not,
7025020	7027740	it's a little bit shorter of a show tonight, but that's OK.
7027740	7030620	It was a little lighter with the news because everybody's
7030620	7033700	busy at the movies seeing that movie and so forth.
7033740	7037660	So I want to thank everybody for participating along with our show tonight,
7037660	7040420	whether you were listening, whether you were here live with us on Sunday night,
7040420	7042260	whether you are lurking.
7042260	7044380	Hey, we love you all. Thanks for being a part of the show.
7044580	7046500	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio,
7046620	7048420	please tell a friend or two about the show.
7048420	7051260	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
7051260	7053380	but we need more voices to put out here on air.
7053380	7057100	So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or wherever it is
7057100	7059420	you found this podcast, Spotify, whatever.
7059420	7062420	I guess Spotify lets you leave comments on individual episodes now.
7062420	7063660	I haven't really looked into that much,
7063660	7066660	but if somebody leaves us a comment, I'll go look for it.
7067620	7069500	Do that. Say nice things.
7069500	7071340	If you leave a nasty comment, I'm ignoring it.
7071340	7073660	So but that's yeah,
7075580	7077020	those going off a long way.
7077020	7077900	So thank you so much.
7079060	7080460	That's that's all I got.
7080460	7083180	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
7083460	7086820	Dark Sakura, who I know is going to go off to play some dead by daylight.
7086860	7087940	I'll start with you.
7087940	7090380	What is your final thought for tonight?
7090380	7092780	About my subathon, because I want people to hang out.
7092980	7096300	And it's not the subs are like not really the most important thing to me.
7097540	7101180	But however, if I reach 250 total, I'll bleach my hair live on stream.
7101860	7105020	Um, I will go platinum, y'all platinum.
7105980	7108140	But I just want people to hang out with me on my birthday.
7108140	7110980	It's April 19th, starts at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.
7111380	7115060	And I just want people to hang out with me on my birthday.
7115660	7117140	I can't go to Disneyland.
7117140	7118540	Can't go to San Francisco yet.
7118540	7120940	So hang out with me.
7120940	7122860	I'm old. Send Geritol.
7124740	7127940	If you want, I'll come bring you some prune juice.
7127940	7130020	It is a warrior's drink.
7130860	7133420	Well, you can just come over anyway.
7133500	7136580	I won't be able to be there during the day when I'm working,
7136580	7138220	but I'll pop in after work.
7138220	7139100	And if you're
7140220	7143140	LFG, I'll hop in for at least a couple of games of Debbie.
7143260	7146820	So well, and the the sort of palate cleanser games
7146820	7150260	are going to be Marvel Midnight Sons and Cult of the Lamb.
7150580	7155460	And I think I may be able to attempt a Gartic Phone.
7155820	7158500	If you haven't played Gartic Phone, it's kind of it's kind of.
7158820	7161540	That's that's I've played a party game.
7161540	7163740	That is that. But it wasn't called that.
7164140	7166580	I usually only ever played it on Nick's stream,
7166580	7169060	but I might try hosting it myself. We'll see. It might be fun.
7169980	7171740	All right. Well, thank you.
7171740	7172900	Thank you, Dark Sakura.
7172900	7174900	We'll see you next time. Have a great stream.
7175860	7181100	All right. See y'all on flip side and play pinball. Bye.
7181180	7183540	I love pinball. I will.
7183540	7185220	Loki, your final thought for tonight.
7185220	7187380	Ever since you were a young boy, did you play the silver ball?
7188540	7191140	From Soho down to Brighton.
7191140	7192260	I don't know the next lyric,
7192260	7194260	but I know exactly what you're referencing them all.
7194300	7196460	Yeah, I must have played them all. That's all right.
7196460	7198060	All right. Bye. Bye.
7198060	7199420	All right. Loki, your final thought tonight.
7199420	7201180	And don't break out in a song, please.
7201180	7203140	I will never do that.
7203140	7206780	So my final thought is hopefully we'll have some more content
7206780	7208740	on the YouTube channel this week.
7208740	7210980	I'm hoping to get one or two videos out this week.
7211220	7213180	Awesome. Trying to step it up.
7214020	7217620	My final thought, I will definitely be streaming more Final Fantasy
7217620	7218980	or not Final Fantasy.
7218980	7220420	Well, I'll probably play that again at some point, too,
7220420	7222180	but definitely some more.
7222700	7223380	What's that game called?
7223380	7224940	Pokemon Legends Arceus.
7224940	7226860	Probably tomorrow going to continue on the main game
7226860	7229220	because I did some stuff off stream and I have some new
7229220	7230620	Pokemons to show you.
7230620	7233020	So I'll be playing that tomorrow after work at some point as well.
7233020	7234780	I've got a lot of work to catch up on
7234780	7236940	since I was out for two weeks unexpectedly,
7237660	7238860	but we'll get there.
7238860	7240980	So but that's it for me.
7241140	7243780	Thank you all again for participating with our show tonight.
7243780	7245180	I really appreciate you all being here.
7245180	7247380	I hope you all have a fantastic week ahead.
7247380	7248580	I hope you had a good Easter.
7248580	7251020	If that's your thing, Passover, if that's your thing
7251500	7252580	or whatever is your thing.
7252580	7254740	If just sleeping in on Sunday is your thing.
7254740	7256420	I hope I hope it was great.
7256420	7258620	Quite frankly, we'll see you again.
7259140	7261340	Don't forget your taxes unless you live in a place
7261340	7263020	where the deadline got extended.
7263020	7264580	Don't don't forget that.
7264580	7267380	And we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7267380	7268620	Have a great week, everybody.
