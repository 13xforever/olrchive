Niantic's business model appears to be to own the augmented reality gaming space. By which I mean the yet another reason to be staring at your phone while outside gaming space. Their concepts for these games are neat, and the attempts at theming it for more players is an okay idea, but I think its notable allure and functionality peaked with Pokemon GO, at least until AR headsets become a thing.

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
This is the Ready Player Two dystopia in real life. Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. We are live one more time with episode number 957 of our show for tonight, April the 23rd of 2023. My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined each and every week with my co hosts over there on the upper right of your screen if you're watching live is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hi, how are you?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Okay.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Awesome. Sorry, your audio is a little off tonight. That's all right. It's just threw me.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Really? That's what well Shayla was saying that and I haven't done anything.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
I think coming through your webcam. That's gonna be my guess. That's what it sounds like. So that's right. While you tinkle with that, why don't I go ahead and introduce?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Tinkle?

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
You tinker, tinkle, whatever, tinker on the tinkle. Say hello to Mr. Loki.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Hello.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Hi, how are you?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm fine.

01:36.000 --> 01:48.000
Good. What is that playing behind you tonight? It's like a Zelda. Is that the, that's the modem Zelda from the NES or no, it was on SNES.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
That, that.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
That's a Tel Aviv. It's a PS Zelda.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Yeah, no, but it's not PS. It's actually a pretty good remake of Zelda, right?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yeah.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I wish this would come to the eShop.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Right? Yeah. I mean, it's like Nintendo knows how to do their old products, but.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Is this better?

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Oh, much better. There we go. There's the dark Sakura we know and love. Hi once again.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Hi.

02:10.000 --> 02:18.000
Hi. You know what? Discord does that sometimes. I've had the same problem. Like Bobby will call. So our pal Bobby Blackwolf, because set up again.

02:18.000 --> 02:27.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG network.

02:27.000 --> 02:37.000
And I've had, Bobby is always gracious to have me on at the end of his show in a little like holdover kind of way inspired by the Daily Show, Stephen Colbert, that, that whole era.

02:37.000 --> 02:46.000
And sometimes Bobby, I get on with Bobby and he's like, your webcam's the mic, right? So Discord does something funky. I don't know what it is. Like reset your audio.

02:46.000 --> 03:06.000
Every Windows update, it seems to reset. It'll default to default, which it's like kind of throwing a, it's like picking a input at random or something like that. So that'll happen all the time. Like, and I'll get the output as my monitor speakers or something like that. It's like, Oh, seriously, seriously.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
So, all right. But we have Jamie and her voice is pristine. So how are you doing, Jamie?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm doing all right. I'm a little tired.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
A little tired? Well, I mean, you stayed up for 24 hours earlier this week. Happy belated birthday. I know we said happy birthday.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
Well, I also went to San Francisco yesterday and hung out with JD.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh, shoot. Oh, um, the Sakura festivals in China or Japan town this week, right?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
It was over.

03:35.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh, it was over. Oh, that's almost almost. Oh, it's always, almost always right around your birthday weekend. Bummer.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, I usually can go for my birthday, but this, this time it was a week early and I couldn't get off work.

03:48.000 --> 03:57.000
But I did, you know, I went around and I looked at all this stuff and I was just thinking to myself of the stuff that I was purchasing.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
And like, I used to go to Japan video, which is thankfully still there. The arcades gone.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff gone, but I used to go and like buy wall scrolls and plushies and all kinds of toys.

04:10.000 --> 04:19.000
And this time I spent more time in SoCo hardware, buying gardening tools and makeup and skincare.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Well, you know, it's interesting.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
And congee flashcards. Am I growing up? Stop.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, what's also interesting to me, not to say that this affects your taste, I don't think it does,

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
but I think about how a lot of those plushie stores that were very unique to the Japan town experience,

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
whether it was us going to San Francisco or even going all the way down to LA.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And I remember they had a really sweet little area there, too.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
A lot of those stores feel like now they're in mainstream malls.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Like I was...

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
There's one in Arden Fair.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, there's lots of those types of stores.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
There was a store at the Galleria in Roseville.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
I happened to be out there not long ago.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
And it was right next to Build-A-Bear because we were looking at the, because they have some Mario movie.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
You can get a stuffed Bowser and you can get a bear in a Mario outfit and peach outfit and all that stuff.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
And so right next to that, though, is a plushie store.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
And even worse, if you've ever watched Alan stream those crane games, it's the exact same plushies that are in those crane games.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
So I'm like, Alan, you're not allowed within a thousand feet of the Galleria.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
I can't have you go into that store.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Well, I was even looking at plushies.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
There was a Kirby I liked and then there was a Monokuma.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
And then I just stopped and I was like, we just found all of my family of Pokémon.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Giant plushies like my Togepi that I got when I was held up at gunpoint.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
And my ginormous Charmander pillow.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
And what was the other one that I have?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Oh, my giant Miasu.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
My Meowth, but I got a Japanese one, so it's Miasu.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
And then that was, I was like, I'm kind of good.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I have all these Animal Crossing plushies. I don't have anywhere to put.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I have all these plushies next to me.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Well, I mean, I guess I put them where I put them.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
But like, if I could angle my cameras that much.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
But hold on.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
For those who are watching.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Sure. For those on Twitch, DarkSaga is showing off a bit of her collection.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
There's like an Eevee Pokémon. There's a few.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I can't name them all, but there's a lot.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
There'll be a Sonic. There's a plush bunny that was got to cheer me up.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
A Riolki. A Kerochan.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
A DDR machine.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
We have so many plushies.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
There's like a box full of plushies in the garage.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
I love my husband, but I've told him, no more plushies.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
No, I've got bags of them.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
And somewhere over there, it's like on my Animal Crossing list.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Uh oh, guess who walked into the studio bringing his husband coffee

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
right as I'm talking shit.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
He just walked in here going, I heard you talking shit.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Hi, sorry.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
But no more plushies, Alan.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
But I did.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
He just said, I do what I want.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.000
Get something that I want, even though I have like some big ones that were somebody else's

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
that I just use as decoration.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I got myself a little Daruma.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
That's cute.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
And you're supposed to set a goal

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
and fill in the eyes when you reach the goal.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
So this is for a particular goal I have.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And then something I got was a little Kirby blind pack.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Not in San Francisco.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I got it before my birthday.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But it has a little Waddle Dee in it.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Oh, it's cute.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
You know what's even better than plushies?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Coffee.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
No money. You know why?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And you know what's worse than that?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
When you spill coffee on yourself.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
You can buy coffee.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I spilled coffee on myself because this thing was a little too full.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
So let's get to our drinking problem.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Alan just yelled from the other room.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
That's what you get.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Loki, could you get into tonight's kickoff topic, please?

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, so Nintendo had an Indie World Direct that was this week.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
And they showed off a bunch of different indie games that would be coming out for the Switch.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
And well, of course, other things as well.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
So starting things off, just kind of in no particular order here.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
We had Manico's Night Market, which looks pretty cool.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It's a fun adventure game.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
And they've got this magical cat thing.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I don't really know what that's supposed to be.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
But that's going to be coming out on September 26th.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
We had a game called Sandrock, or My Time at Sandrock.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
Which is, I guess, a game where you're restoring the desert.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
It's not much to restore in a desert.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Put more cactus in there, I guess.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Make things drier.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Maybe that's what they need to do.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
But some sort of farm management sim in a desert.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Can you have a horse with no name?

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
I mean, you can do whatever you want in Sandrock.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
So you can go through the desert on a horse with no name.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Yep, you can definitely do that.

09:11.000 --> 09:16.000
Plate Up is going to be coming out on the eShop in October.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Which looks pretty cool.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
And it's kind of one of those restaurant sim type things.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
This is something that looks fun.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I love games with cats in it.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
But Quilts and Cats of Calico.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
It is a game with a cat.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And there are quilts with a cat laying on said quilt.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
And it looks to be some sort of puzzle, I guess, puzzle game.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
With the different colors and everything.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I'm not really sure how exactly it works.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
But in the game, there are cats walking around.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
And you can pet the cats while you're playing the game.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
I mean, that's just, that's perfect.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
You got to have that in any sort of puzzle game.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh, hold on, I got to take a cat petting break.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Speaking of more cat games.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Oh, I'm sorry, I sat down at just the right time.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And if you saw me change my shirt, no, you didn't.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
But yeah, the cat game looks amazing.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Yes, speaking of cat games, there's still another cat game,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Little Kitty Big City, which looks awesome as well.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
That's like, I don't know if it's similar to say, Stray,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
but you know, in the sense that you're wandering a city as a cat.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
But this looks like, you know, a little less cyberpunk

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
and a little more cute cat that's wandering around

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
and you can, you know, steal fish and talk to birds.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
So I like that. It looks cool.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
This will be exciting for some of our music game fans,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
but there's going to be yet another NecroDancer game.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
So we have Rift of the NecroDancer.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
It's a kind of like it reminded me a little bit

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
between Elite Beat Agents and like Guitar Hero type stuff.

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
So it's got different, I guess they say it's lane based combat

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
with like kind of the rhythm game type stuff.

11:08.000 --> 11:13.000
But they also have like other minigame things that happen

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
that look similar to kind of like almost Elite Beat Agents.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah, I can't tell what's happening in this game, which is fine.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I think it's cool to innovate on the rhythm genre a little bit.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And it seems like there's actually more going on here

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
than just the lane type of stuff.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
So, yeah, but this was really cool.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Like obviously music games are always going to be like

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
a little bit near and dear to my heart, right?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
When you consider the history of this show.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
But yeah, that looked really cool.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Mm hmm.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
So then there's a game, I love the name of this game.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Crimo Clock.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
It's a map based crime solving adventure.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
It says you go traveling through time

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
and apparently your actions influence different time periods.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Hmm.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I just like the name Crimo Clock.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Teslagrad 2 and Teslagrad Remastered coming to the eShop.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Actually, they're out on the eShop because it's one of those

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
and you can get it now type of things.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
So that's pretty cool.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Let's see that coming to the Switch.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Real quick before you get to the next game,

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I want to introduce the chat room.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Sorry, my rhythm of the intro got thrown off by my coffee crisis.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
So we do tape live, of course, at 9 o'clock Eastern,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
6 o'clock Pacific at twitch.tv slash vog network.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
And you can chat along with us, such as some folks are talking

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
about the rift of the necro dancer in our chat right now.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Mike Deff says it actually reminds me of the guitar hero

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
or rock band with Rhythm Heaven.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
And our wonderful voiceover guy VXJ6V is in chat saying

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
it's guitar hero cross Rhythm Heaven cross WarioWare.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Honestly, you sell me when you talk about it that way.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Dark Tutsi agrees with that description of it.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Pod Culture says I like the art style.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Me too.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
I like that video games get more and more and better and better

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
cartoons somehow.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Like you look at games like that and like Hi-Fi Rush and,

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
you know, a lot of the modern cartoony games is like, man,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
I thought Super Mario Brothers 2 was a good looking cartoon game.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Look at what we got now.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
This is great.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Yeah.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
They showed off a trailer for a game called Animal Well,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
which is coming out sometime next year.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
It looks like some sort of like dark exploration game,

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
which this kind of like.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
It's a it's a pixelated style,

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
but it's like pixelated with like modern like effects on it or something.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
They've done this before with different games,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
but it looks pretty cool.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
And then what else?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Shadows Over Loathing.

13:43.000 --> 13:50.000
It's a hand drawn stick figure style mystery solving game set in the 1920s.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
So that's pretty cool.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
Blasphemous 2, a 2D action platformer.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
That's going to be coming out later this summer.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Oxenfree 2 Lost Signals looked interesting.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
That's coming out July 12.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
And I guess it's set five years after the first game.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Still haven't played the first one, but this looks really cool.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
It's kind of like almost like an adventure type game.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah, Oxenfree.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Oxenfree is kind of neat.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I did play a little bit of the original because it was actually like one of

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
the first like game pass games.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I remember checking out because it was on game pass for a while.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
And it was a pretty popular game from those.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I have to admit, I didn't get very far,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
but those that played it and beat it are awfully fond of it.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
So I feel like the sequel's been in some ways a long time coming because

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
you said it's set five years after the first.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I feel like the first game's been out longer than five years too.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
It's been a while.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
It looks interesting with the whole like radio mechanic where you can kind

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
of tune in different things.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
And the art style's really amped up from what I remember.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Not that it was bad before.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
It was very stylish.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
But this is like really definitely a new level for this.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
This is cool.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Yeah.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
Then they started talking about a little bit of DLC for different things.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
So we have a little to the left cupboards and drawers DLC.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I'm not sure what that is.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
I guess it's arranging drawers and shelves.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Cool.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
OK, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I have to I have to know more about what that.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Tucked away.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Sorry.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
This is what I get for trying to manage the trailers and that stuff on the fly.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
So this is I do not know what this game, but it looks like what's unpacking

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
or that moving game.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
It looks a lot like that.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Kind of.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Actually, this stage looks like Operation.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
So it's like shove stuff in there.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Yes.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh, and there's a cat in this game.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
So already we're we're loving that.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So, OK, sorry.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Thank you for humoring me.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I just had to know more about this game, but that looks cute.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is getting some DLC as well with.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
They are having two new playable characters and more puzzles,

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
and that's going to be out for free probably soon because it says it's for spring.

15:57.000 --> 16:05.000
Called The Lamb Relics of the Old Faith update is coming actually tomorrow.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
I am so ready for this.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I have been waiting.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Jamie, what is this all about?

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Because I know you've played plenty of Cult of the Lamb because I know you've been streaming it and so forth.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
It's going to be like some new buildings and a permadeath mode and a boss rush mode.

16:22.000 --> 16:29.000
Maybe I think new people to recruit into the cult.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I mean, I've already finished the game once.

16:31.000 --> 16:36.000
I think I would kind of consider starting from the beginning with the new content.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
I just spent 48 dollars Canadian.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Just now.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
On what?

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
On the third Dead by Daylight soundtrack.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I was like, what are you buying from Canada?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Okay, got it.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
And the US one is like way sold out.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I see, I see.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Cult of the Lamb DLC looks pretty cool.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
More games.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
We had Brotato.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I love that name.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
It's a twin stick shooter, kind of that like hand drawn.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
A few friends have been playing that.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Brotato?

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah, it's like a...

17:18.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah, I don't know if it's necessarily, I mean, it's got that kind of vampire survivor type of look to it.

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
So I mean, it's a very similar type of style game there, it looks like.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach came out later that day.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So that's out on the Switch now.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Bomb Rush Cyber Funk.

17:40.000 --> 17:48.000
That's going to be coming out on August 18th on the Switch and of course other systems, but you know.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I like your name.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
It is the game that is kind of like sort of spiritual successor to the Jet Set Radio.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
So, you know, that might be worth checking out.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
Escape Academy Complete Edition is going to be out here pretty soon.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
This fall actually on the Switch.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
I guess it's already been out on other platforms, but now coming to the Switch.

18:13.000 --> 18:21.000
And then there's a game called Chance of Sennar, which kind of like a stylistic looking game.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
I saw some comparisons to Journey.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Maybe not that, but it does look cool.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Kind of like a puzzle adventure game.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
So that's pretty neat.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I think, was that everything?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Oh, Paper Trail.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
This is kind of a, it won a lot of awards, that's for sure.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Some sort of narrative adventure game.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
Where you have like pages that you can manipulate to like solve puzzles and stuff like that.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Kind of like folding things over.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
So a very kind of full Nintendo Indie Direct.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
Lots of stuff in there.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
And obviously the music game fans are very happy because I'm looking at our chat.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
We have some more comments, even more comments on NecroDancer and all of that as a series.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
VXJ6V points out NecroDancer's bloom has been pretty fantastic.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
The original game, Cadence of Hyrule, and now a new experience.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And then Bobby Blackwell fads onto that.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
There's that crypt of the NecroDancer pinball table in the new pinball FX.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
They try to make you flip to the beat.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I'm not sure how you would do that with pinball.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
That's very interesting, but I'm sure, you know, because it's virtual, there's a way to do it.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
So I'm very curious about that one for sure.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
And then of course, that Bomb Rush cyber funk being a spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio has attention.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Shadley Lindershane is in chat, hello, saying Bomb Rush cyber funk is a day one purchase easily.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
I cannot wait for that. Feels like it's been in development for forever.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
So I'm happy it's about done.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
Mike Deft also happy with the release date and Dark Tetsuya reminding us that it has music by Hideki Naganuma.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
So it's definitely trying to recreate Jet Set Radio.

19:58.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, I mean the art style, the music, it's pretty interesting.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
That's also very interesting.

20:06.000 --> 20:14.000
You have this, you know, indie spiritual successor coming when there's always those rumors about Sega reviving some other legacy properties.

20:14.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah. And that that one is I don't know if that's just fan wishing or, you know, if it's I mean, the screenshots are out there, the videos out there.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
So like, I think it's coming.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
It's just like, yeah, the leak or whatever.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
I mean, like soon or later, it could be.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
And that's fine.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
Both can exist, you know, perfectly fine.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, I don't know.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
We'll just have to wait and see.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I mean, what?

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Not E3 is right around the corner.

20:43.000 --> 20:50.000
What a June release, nebulous summer game announcement month is coming.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
E3 is around the corner.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.000
I'm looking forward to it.

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
Remind me to write a message on social media the day E3 was supposed to start and say like, hey, I'm at the L.A. Convention Center.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Where is everybody?

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Thought we were getting together today for the biggest event in gaming.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Was told there would be an Ouya parking event.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I'm sorry, that's that's a few years too late.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
All right.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Let's get into the things that haven't been canceled.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
And that's the games that we have been playing this week in a segment that we call appropriately.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
How is your gaming week?

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Oh, I'm sorry, you're muted on Discord.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
I see your icon.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Yeah, because I didn't want people to hear me chewing into the mic.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Fair enough.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
My week was long.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
I played Dead by Daylight on Sunday and Monday.

21:44.000 --> 21:59.000
And I, I didn't play on Tuesday as a break, a buffer before the 24 hour marathon, which I made it the full 24 hours where I played Marvel's Midnight Suns as well as Dead by Daylight.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I was I was in no shape.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
I couldn't I don't know half of what I said in the morning.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
I was delirious.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
I remember peeking in and lurking for just a hot minute, like because I was very busy with work, so I couldn't really be in there during work hours.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
But I peeked in just to like, is she still going?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
And you were still going.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I was like, dang, good for her.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
The 18 hour mark.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And I was like, I could do this.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
The 21 hour mark, I was like, the fuck am I thinking?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Oh, fuck's sake.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
That was like what was going through my head.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
And then I was saying all kinds of weird shit that I have no idea what I was saying.

22:35.000 --> 22:42.000
And then I was going into like that weird sort of mutism I get when I'm really tired and overwhelmed.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
So I was having trouble speaking like toward the end and I made it through.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
And actually, big shout out to everyone who played with me.

22:53.000 --> 23:02.000
Haim, who is a new friend, C-A-I-M, a newer friend who I bought stickers from on Etsy and we became friends.

23:02.000 --> 23:08.000
And Fixation Gaze and Shayla and Gwen.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
Gwen was with me a big chunk of the time, of course.

23:12.000 --> 23:18.000
And also to our new friend Feathers, who we met in Q and joined in and played.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
So hi, Feathers.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
Actually, Feathers also won a sticker on one of the giveaways.

23:25.000 --> 23:33.000
And along with that, some of the redeems, if we hit certain levels with it, I would do plies on stream and releves.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
So I did some plies and releves.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
So I got some exercise in.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
And crap.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, yeah.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
And I got a bot raid, a follow bot raid, you know.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
So I had to go in and remove that.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
That's still a thing?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Apparently.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
Well, they're not saying anything.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
They're just following.

23:55.000 --> 24:06.000
And I turned off the alerts, you know, and I ended up banning first and then removing them, you know, so I wouldn't get in trouble.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
And apparently the potato song that's a redeem on my channel is copyrighted.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Who knew?

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Oh, who knew?

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
So only that part, though, is silenced.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
So I have to think of something to replace the potato song with.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.000
And it might be Brak's I Like Beans.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
Because I haven't gotten in trouble for playing anything from Brak.

24:33.000 --> 24:40.000
But at any rate, it was a pretty good time.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
It was pretty successful.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
There were some people I thought were going to be there that weren't.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
But I understand real life comes, you know, comes first.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
But I was, you know, a little bummed over that.

24:53.000 --> 24:59.000
But, you know, it was just that day after calm down where it's like, was that really worth me doing 24 hours?

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
I feel so weird because, you know, I slept five hours for a nap.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
And that was all super jittery.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
And I figured out this because I didn't do any exercising that morning.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I just went and plopped.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Dan said I was out and I was like, of course I was.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
And then I didn't stream last night like I normally do because I was getting back from San Francisco.

25:23.000 --> 25:32.000
So next Saturday, I will be if I don't do it already, I will probably be beating Midnight Suns on stream.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Oh, cool.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
Because I went and did all the the background friendship stuff off.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Off cam.

25:42.000 --> 25:49.000
Yeah, and I'm ready to do it, but I I hit gold four.

25:49.000 --> 25:56.000
And on Dead by Daylight, which I would have hoped I would have hit gold something and I'm ready to keep going.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
So tonight back into it.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Awesome. Sounds good.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
Yeah, I dropped in for a little bit and I know I was going to give out subs because I saw most people were giving out five subs.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
I was like, well, I'm going to one up and give out six so I can be at the top of the leaderboard.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.000
But then I saw when I came in the next morning, pod culture had outdone me at some point, brat.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Yeah, yeah, he sure did.

26:19.000 --> 26:29.000
And honestly, I have to say that I appreciate every last single one of them, especially the people who subbed on their own.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
I mean, I appreciate the gift subs. Don't don't don't get me wrong there.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
But for people who thought that I was worth paying an ongoing subscription for.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
I absolutely I'm over the moon over it.

26:41.000 --> 26:51.000
So and and for the new followers that came in, my goal for this month was to hit 700 followers and I did before the subathon.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
So, you know, I'm just you know, I'm happy to make friends.

26:56.000 --> 27:01.000
That's what I wanted was to have friends with me on my birthday, even if we couldn't be together in person.

27:01.000 --> 27:08.000
And that's what I got. And I ate a rum cake. It was a little rum cake and and felt really old the next day.

27:08.000 --> 27:21.000
And but I mean, I want to thank everybody who came in, who gifted, who gave, who cheered, who subbed themselves, everything.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
All the support means a lot to me and it means I'll keep going.

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
I have to say your ability to do that for 24 hours is kind of inspired me to maybe do something around my birthday.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
My birthday's on Monday, though. I don't know. But I don't think I couldn't I couldn't go for 24 hours.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
There's no way. No way. I'm not even going to promise that.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
I'm not going to do it again. I'm not going to do it again. Maybe when I turn.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
The other decade.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
But because because remember, I turned the years old.

27:54.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah, I know. Well, this year is a big one for me because it's a multiple of five.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
I am I am an appropriate gamer score for Bobby Black Wolf now, because if you don't know,

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
Bobby Black Wolf will only play Xbox 360 games where the achievements end in zero or five.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
So he can have a whole number and a whole number.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
So I will be I will be I know I know it's five isn't really, but it's I guess it's half a whole number.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
So it works. Have Bobby explain it to you, OK?

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
But I will be a Bobby Black Wolf appropriate achievement number in June.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
I think Bobby should update it to where his score can only be prime numbers.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
It might be hard to stay on top of. All right.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
At any rate. Yeah, it was fun. I had a good time.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
It was nice to see people and.

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
Nice to sleep afterwards. I bet. All right.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
Well, on that note, we'll go over to Loki. How was your gaming week, Loki?

28:53.000 --> 28:59.000
I just been playing Minecraft and making Minecraft content because I have to do that and keep doing that.

28:59.000 --> 29:06.000
You put out a little video I saw. I put out a new video because like I we were talking already about end of season.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
And wow. Well, I mean, it's up for a while.

29:10.000 --> 29:18.000
But I have a lot I got to build, so I'm feeling the crunch.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
I mean, and I knew that was going to be the case. That's why I started so early.

29:21.000 --> 29:29.000
But this also means that I'm going to be balancing my content differently instead of going between a bunch of different series.

29:29.000 --> 29:36.000
It's going to be mainly the S&P for a while until I get everything done. But like I am working on stuff.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
So what did you do in this latest video? Because I brought it up to kind of look at it.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
But you have to explain Minecraft to me because I'm not as seasoned on it as you are.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
So Minecraft added in 117. So that was like two updates ago. It added the ability or added copper.

29:52.000 --> 30:01.000
So there's copper blocks. They start off as an actual copper color, which is like kind of an orange ish metallic color.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
And then over time, they will oxidize into that kind of dark green color.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
And so it's just a mechanic that they added to the game.

30:12.000 --> 30:23.000
Yeah. So over time, they'll oxidize. But, you know, if you're going to be building something, you may just want specific colors, you know, to build whatever that is you're trying to build.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
And so you can actually stop the color changing process by like waxing them and stuff like that.

30:28.000 --> 30:35.000
So in Minecraft, though, when you have copper blocks that are close together, it takes longer for them to oxidize.

30:35.000 --> 30:43.000
If you space them apart, the proper spacing is four blocks in between each copper block and they'll oxidize the quickest.

30:43.000 --> 30:54.000
And so right now, the solutions to do that is you go and find a giant field and you place them all down about five or four blocks apart and then you wait.

30:54.000 --> 31:01.000
So I decided to go ahead and build a machine that does it for me, that will space them out properly.

31:01.000 --> 31:08.000
And I can sit there AFK to just push them in there. So it's basically this giant conveyor belt of blocks.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Oh, my God. That's what we're looking at in this video.

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
Yeah. So it's a giant conveyor belt of blocks. It's like eight layers deep.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
And so I had to dig out this giant hole to, you know, get it all in there.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
But basically, yeah, it so allows you to AFK it. There's other solutions that people have come up with.

31:25.000 --> 31:33.000
One required you to basically use gravel and like copper blocks and you had to kind of place them down.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
But you place both of them down. There's another one that someone's come up with on empires.

31:39.000 --> 31:46.000
Pixel riffs who made this thing called David because David Copperfield.

31:46.000 --> 31:56.000
So his design was basically that you have a flying machine that takes the copper and then it puts it into a machine.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
It waits for the fully oxidized and then it will automatically collect it and bring it back out.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
But you still have to manually put all that in there for the flying machine to take it.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
So I wanted a solution that was different than all of those.

32:08.000 --> 32:16.000
And I could just sit there AFK because you can actually get it where Minecraft will hold like one of the mouse buttons down for you.

32:16.000 --> 32:25.000
There's a trick to do that. And so I could sit there AFK and it would just process all the copper through the machine without me having to do anything.

32:25.000 --> 32:32.000
And so this recycles all of the gravel back so you don't have to worry about placing the gravel down.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
It's always perfectly spaced apart, stuff like that.

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
So I'm very proud of it because I don't really make like giant redstone things like they're custom.

32:41.000 --> 32:46.000
A lot of times, you know, if someone's done something like, OK, I'll just use that because that's probably the best way to do it.

32:46.000 --> 32:54.000
And I don't want to I don't have time working a full time job and making content to research and develop redstone like this.

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
So I had I've been wanting to do this for a while and I finally just said, OK, I'm going to do it.

32:59.000 --> 33:04.000
And then so I did that and came up with this design and it took some time to get it to work.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
But then now it does and it's great and I love it.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
All right. Well, congrats on the latest video and hopefully everybody's already following your YouTube at Loki O.L.R.

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
But if not, here's here's a chance for folks to correct that.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
Getting close to a thousand. Almost there.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.000
OK. Don't have the watch hours yet. So still got a ways before you can monetize.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
But it's getting there. Another two thousand watch hours.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
You'll get there. You'll get there. All right.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Everybody leave leave the videos on in the background this week.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.000
Did you did did you see that I reposted your channel today?

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
I didn't see. Thank you. You're welcome.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
And because I actually watched your video. Oh, thank you.

33:48.000 --> 33:56.000
All the way. Yeah, we're going to I'm trying to make stuff for the next Robot Master.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
So I'm actually I've been trying to build a Moby.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.000
Do you remember the Moby is it's a giant whale. Yeah.

34:07.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah, I'm trying to build a whale right now. It's it's it's I don't know how I how easily I did the the giant octopus and the fish before.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
But like I it's been a while since I tried to like model one of those things.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
And now it's it's tough, but it's going to be awesome.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
You have a giant whale for no reason. Just because I want to giant whale.

34:32.000 --> 34:42.000
I do have to say with the opening inside your your building, I had like this major art deco vibe just with all the squares and then how the chandeliers and everything were laid out.

34:43.000 --> 34:49.000
I was like, oh, this is classy. It's a classy joint. Yes.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
With with Mega Man's face. You got it. Yeah.

34:53.000 --> 34:58.000
I have to incorporate somehow. Otherwise, it's just like just the base. It's got to have Mega Man stuff everywhere.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
I can't wait because at the very end, I'm going to build Wily's castle at the top. It's going to be cool.

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
But yeah. All right. Got to get it all done.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
All right. Well, my gaming week, I actually beat a game on stream this week. I'm very proud of myself for doing that.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
And that was, of course, Pokemon Legends Arceus, which I've talked about a few weeks now on this show.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
I did actually play the game to completion. I beat it on Monday stream.

35:23.000 --> 35:30.000
But here's the thing. Like most Pokemon games, just because you kind of beat it and roll credits doesn't mean there's that's the end.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
There's usually like a postgame quest and most of the mainline series.

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
I like chasing down, I think, I think it was the legendaries actually in Sword and Shield.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
I think you just beat the last trainers. They actually go get the legendary after the fact, after the credits.

35:44.000 --> 35:52.000
So this one, it's kind of similar. You get one of the legendaries at the end of the game, but then you're kind of chasing down a bunch of other legendaries.

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
So I did play through of that. I actually beat it pretty quickly in a Monday stream.

35:56.000 --> 36:03.000
So I streamed some of that on Monday. It's more that on Tuesday where I was actually going around collecting quite a number of legendaries in the game.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
I won't get into too much of the detail, although I know the game's been out a year. It's pretty hard to spoil at this point.

36:08.000 --> 36:16.000
But then I kind of hit the point where it's like, OK, now if you want to unlock anything else story related, there was a pretty big plot twist reveal.

36:16.000 --> 36:21.000
I mean, it was it was really obvious that it was coming, but it was a big reveal.

36:21.000 --> 36:30.000
We love a reveal. And there was a big reveal with the end of that kind of legend collecting quest and a really tough fight, actually, that I didn't beat the first time on stream.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
And then to kind of keep going now, you have to like finish the Pokedex.

36:34.000 --> 36:42.000
And so that's a big like that's a big ramp that I don't think I'm going to actually play to completion on stream because I'm ready to move on and do some other games.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
And I'm going to try to move into the Final Fantasy pixel remaster probably tomorrow.

36:48.000 --> 36:58.000
I'm actually working in the office this week, so my timing might be a little off, but I'm really itching to get into the pixel remasters now that they finally released on PlayStation and Switch.

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
I know they've been out on Steam, but, you know, there's there's the new releases with the better font and some of the quality of life things that they've put in as well.

37:05.000 --> 37:15.000
So I'm excited to dive into that. Otherwise, for my gaming week, mostly the Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3, I actually did by daylight a little bit.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
I haven't been playing a lot lately, but they did the big rebalancing stuff and I was kind of curious, like, oh, how does this change the game?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Maybe I'll try some of these tome challenges.

37:25.000 --> 37:36.000
So I've actually been playing a little bit. And one thing I guess I kind of do like is that because maybe the meta is a little harder to find right now, I do feel like I see a bigger variety in perks right now.

37:36.000 --> 37:44.000
I just see killers using like different perks. It's not all the same. It's not like not every killer has Call of Brine. It's different now.

37:44.000 --> 37:49.000
Even the same thing with survivors. You know, usually you see like, oh, every survivor has Dead Hard.

37:49.000 --> 37:57.000
So I do like that right now. And that's been cool. I still have never gone against a Skull Merchant.

37:57.000 --> 38:05.000
The one I'm seeing now all the time is Hag. I guess because some of the changes they did to Boons make her a little more attractive to play or whatever.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
More people are playing her. That's for sure. So I've been seeing her a lot. Never.

38:09.000 --> 38:17.000
But I did play a game as Skull Merchant to do a tome quest and I would have fucking got my Adept if I went to the right exit door.

38:17.000 --> 38:24.000
The exit doors were really spread out and the survivor picked the right one and grumble grumble. Oh, well. Oh, well.

38:24.000 --> 38:33.000
I still was very impressed that I even got a 3K with Skull Merchant because I'm not a great killer. But anyway, that's been my gaming week.

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
So let's get back into some there's actually a little other thing, too, but it comes up in a story that we have later on. So I'll wait to talk about it there.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
So let's get into some news. Loki, you want to start us off?

38:45.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah. Atari is buying back their old catalog of games from Accolade, Infogrames and Microprose.

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
So they said that they've acquired 100 PC and console titles from the 1980s and the 1990s.

39:02.000 --> 39:11.000
This is the steep catalog includes groundbreaking award winning titles from Accolade, Infogrames and Microprose.

39:11.000 --> 39:18.000
The list has not they haven't said which titles have been purchased so far,

39:18.000 --> 39:25.000
but it's exciting because I'm curious to see what they're going to do with all that stuff now that they have it.

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
We can get get some new new Atari games. Is Atari coming back?

39:32.000 --> 39:43.000
I don't know what the plan is here or maybe it could be, you know, because the recent retro Atari collection, the Atari 50 was pretty well received.

39:43.000 --> 39:51.000
So I wonder if maybe they're not trying to assemble the troops for another type of museum retrospective type of game.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
You know, especially maybe some more obscure computing classes. I don't know.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
It's a wild, wild guess. They mentioned some of them.

39:57.000 --> 40:04.000
OK, so some of the titles that were acquired. Bubsy. It's time for a new Bubsy game.

40:04.000 --> 40:11.000
Hardball, Demolition Racer, 1942 Pacific Air War.

40:11.000 --> 40:20.000
Man, I remember playing that. F11-7A and F14 Air Combat Series games.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
I wonder if they got Accolade's comics. I don't think I've ever done that for a classic game when Jamie's been out.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
I thought you've talked about it. I remember you talking about that.

40:30.000 --> 40:36.000
But that was because I played a shitload of that game as a kid. That's where I remember Accolade from was that game.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
Yeah. The only Accolade game I can remember was Test Drive 3 that I used to play.

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
Oh, yeah. Accolade did the Test Drive series. That's right. Those games were really big when they first came out.

40:46.000 --> 40:59.000
Grandpa's going to tell you a story about the golden age of gaming, but those were really some of the first person car game experiences on a home computer.

40:59.000 --> 41:07.000
It was like Forza or Project Gotham Racing way a long time ago.

41:08.000 --> 41:16.000
It was Test Drive 3. I remember it was so hard for me as a child to understand how to play it.

41:16.000 --> 41:21.000
They had buttons for the windshield wipers and your turn signals and everything like that.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
I just want to drive into Lamborghini. That's all I want to do.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
You'd crash your car and stuff like that. You had to be very careful.

41:28.000 --> 41:34.000
I, of course, did not stay on the roads. I just went straight through the dirt to wherever I was going.

41:34.000 --> 41:40.000
And, you know, hopefully I got there quicker than the other cars. I did not.

41:40.000 --> 41:50.000
Keep in mind that Atari as well as a whole in the racing genre really was like at a peak in that because remember that was the era of hard driving, stunt driving.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
And those games that were really like that was those games.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
I really can't underestimate how big those games were, especially in the arcade for a period of about three years.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
It kind of came and went. But like stunt driving especially was huge.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
Or was that what I might even get the fucking names right. I think that's what they were. Right.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
Hard driving had the loop. And then because everybody loved the loop, they took it a step further.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
And stunt driving had like the corkscrew and all the other stuff. Right.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
I think so. Yeah. So I remember playing nineteen forty two.

42:21.000 --> 42:26.000
My dad's friend had like a PC with nineteen forty two.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Like I remember we went over to their house one time and I was like playing nice here. Here's a game you can play.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
You know, it's like an air combat game. So I got hooked on that for a little bit and that was fun.

42:36.000 --> 42:43.000
Once again, though, like as a child. I could take off in a plane, land it, probably not.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
It was fun while it lasted. I'm sorry. I just had a I had a mind blown moment.

42:48.000 --> 42:53.000
I got to go back to Accolade a minute and go back to that game Accolade Comics that I played like all the time as a kid.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
I just I brought up the Wikipedia just to make sure I was like thinking about the right game because I was like,

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
was it named Accolade Comics or was it named after the hero in the game?

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
I never knew this about the game. The game was created by the co-founders of the Canadian firm Distinctive Software,

43:07.000 --> 43:12.000
Jeff Sember and Don Mattrick.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
The guy that ruined Microsoft made one of my favorite games as a kid. What?

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
The guy that murdered Xbox's trajectory.

43:23.000 --> 43:29.000
Wow. Wow. Then again, look at Tim Sweeney.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
I guess so. Sometimes the greats fall. What can you do?

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
Sometimes the greats fall.

43:37.000 --> 43:43.000
Sometimes you look at your heroes as a kid, you go, damn, what was I thinking?

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
Anyway, sorry, I just had a mind blown moment. But I also.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
Rob, what? A broken clock goes correct twice a day.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
Yeah. Well, that that game was very correct. That's for sure.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.000
But I remember another series that Accolade was really big for was that Bubsy was their series, wasn't it?

44:02.000 --> 44:06.000
Yes. Yeah, he was like the first one that they mentioned on there. Oh, my bad.

44:06.000 --> 44:11.000
And the hardball series. I remember those baseball games were very big, too.

44:11.000 --> 44:18.000
Yeah, that's that's another one that they had mentioned there as well. So I'll be interesting to see what they do with this.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
Star Control. That's right. They used to. That was another big game that Accolade had as well.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
I remember that used to play the hell out of Star Control.

44:28.000 --> 44:33.000
S.H.A. 100 Matt is putting, don't forget the Elvira games might be in this acquisition.

44:33.000 --> 44:39.000
I feel like her likeness stuff would have to be relicensed. I'm not sure how easy that would be.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
But those those PC games were really cool.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
Miss Peterson controls her stuff very, very closely. Yeah.

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
Yeah. But she's also not. She finally stopped making appearances as Elvira.

44:54.000 --> 45:00.000
I know she's threatened to retire like four times now, but I think she finally did stop. Really interesting.

45:00.000 --> 45:08.000
I mean, I will know maybe I think the last thing that she had licensed herself out for, though, was maybe the pinball.

45:08.000 --> 45:16.000
Well, she's still making appearances. She last appeared to sell virus, to my knowledge at the not scary farm thing.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
Was it right before the pandemic? I feel like it was maybe twenty nineteen or something because she used to actually.

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
Yeah. But anyway, it's a new test drive unlimited game coming out this year. Is it really?

45:27.000 --> 45:32.000
Yeah. Test drive unlimited solar crown. It's not obviously made by Atari.

45:32.000 --> 45:44.000
It's made by Nikon or that's his publishing, I think, and being developed by Katie Racine, who has made what now?

45:44.000 --> 45:50.000
WRC. That's a very good series to do some pretty good racing games on the topic of Elvira.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
Orange right does point out they did manage to license the pinball game for pinball arcade.

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
So fingers crossed, saying, I know that might be different. Well, it is still her likeness.

46:00.000 --> 46:08.000
And she had already, though, licensed out for that. I'm talking about the last stern one that came out for her.

46:08.000 --> 46:16.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, maybe there's there's a possibility. Tiger class says was the likelihood they remaster those games.

46:16.000 --> 46:23.000
I believe referring again to the old Elvira PC games or remake them. Dude, I'd be thrilled if we got another Elvira video game.

46:23.000 --> 46:32.000
Like, I know the pinball tables have been sweet and I'm a fan of those, but I'd love to see another like like very tongue in cheek camp, pure camp PC adventure game.

46:32.000 --> 46:41.000
I'd so be about that, but I don't know. I don't know if I see it. I feel like I don't know. I don't I don't know.

46:41.000 --> 46:49.000
I'd I'd be thrilled, but I'd be very surprised. But in a pleasant way, it's it's it's incredibly nice.

46:49.000 --> 46:58.000
It is. That's kind of the thing. That's the part I hate to say is that, like, just the kids today don't appreciate Elvira the way our generation does.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
2022 she was in the Munsters.

47:02.000 --> 47:11.000
And as her last drive in with Joe Bob Briggs as Elvira, as Cassandra Peterson, because I know she's still doing appearances as Cassandra Peterson.

47:11.000 --> 47:21.000
I actually know that was those were just roles. Dr. Elvira was 2021 Netflix and Chills with Dr. Elvira.

47:21.000 --> 47:29.000
Oh, she did do some new specials for one of the streaming services, but I thought it was shutter. But interesting.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
Yeah. Anyway, it looks like the others. She was just herself. Yeah.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
So anyway, interesting. I'm also curious what they're going to do in this catalog expansion.

47:40.000 --> 47:47.000
Now, somebody, of course, in chat had made the, you know, as Joe and Matt said, they're probably coming to the Atari VCS.

47:47.000 --> 47:55.000
Is that really a factor anymore? Like, haven't we written that off at this point? I mean, maybe Atari hasn't, but haven't we tried to stop make fetch happen at this point?

47:55.000 --> 48:05.000
Like, isn't isn't the Atari VCS kind of a write off? I would feel like Atari would be smarter to repackage these into a really uber type of retro collection like Atari 50.

48:05.000 --> 48:12.000
But I don't know what the sales on Atari 50 were like that. That's really what's going to drive everything is. Did it sell, you know?

48:12.000 --> 48:28.000
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, surprisingly, I think the VCS did better for itself than we thought. But like, it's still just a computer. I mean, that's all it really is. It's not like a console. It's just like, it's a computer with some software bundled in type of thing.

48:28.000 --> 48:47.000
So that's kind of a little disappointing. But at the same time, it's probably the safer bet to take. And it did okay, I think. And at the very least, we got, you know, some nice collections out of that stuff. So I don't see them launching a new console. But yeah, let's do some more Atari 50 things because those are pretty cool.

48:48.000 --> 49:09.000
All right. Well, moving on to modern games and what the future might bring for us, or will bring for us. Well, if it doesn't get canceled, we had the announcement this week kind of out of the blue that Niantic, makers of Pokemon Go and Capcom have teamed up for Monster Hunter now. It's going to be a Monster Hunter title for iOS and Android.

49:09.000 --> 49:26.000
And of course, because it's Niantic, you bet is going to use the maps of you know, the real life locations that their other games have brought. And we'll be bringing this game out later this year. You can sign up for a beta test on the official website if you want.

49:27.000 --> 49:50.000
John Hanke in a statement said Monster Hunter now will be the ultimate experience for anyone who has dreamed of facing off against epic monsters and battling them with friends filled with fantastical creatures engrossing hunting and opportunities for teamwork with the best possible graphics on mobile devices. Monster Hunter now is the perfect franchise to bring into the real world. Now I will say this, I was looking at the trailer and looking at the trailer.

49:50.000 --> 50:08.000
I couldn't quite tell if maybe portal scanning and pokestop scanning was finally being used because it sure looked like the monster was kind of interacting with the loop. But you don't know how much they're embellishing for the trailer, right? It's like the first Pokemon Go trailer that showed Mewtwo flying around the sky and 1000 people trying to raid.

50:08.000 --> 50:37.000
That's not really what the game looks like. They were just trying to get out that idea of raiding. So I can't really take this stuff at face value. But when I saw that, I was like, Oh, are we finally going to see what all that scanning is kind of brought with this game? I don't know. But I will say the graphics for a Niantic game did look pretty good. I was like, who did they did? Was this one of the companies they bought or contracted with to do this? I don't know. Because it looks like it's actually being made in Japan. And the announcement of this was very it was like midnight for us. It was it was it was like midnight.

50:38.000 --> 51:03.000
Eight in the morning Japan time. So or a more reasonable time of day Japan time. So I'm very curious about that. So um, and looking at some comments in chat. Let's see. darktatia says I was into the Monster Hunter stuff for at least a little while. So curious to see how this plays. Fifth Dream says $5 for three monster battle passes of tongue in cheek comment about latest Niantic controversy.

51:03.000 --> 51:32.000
Shane says I'm over my excitement for Niantic Mon hun the idea of supporting Niantic again, was enough to squash my desire to play. Which brings us to another point is that it does seem now at this point, that with the latest controversy from Pokemon go a couple weeks ago with the you know, remote raid passes going up in value and the number you can do in a day limited. It's been a couple weeks and Niantic has not responded to the fan backlash. They have this got announced instead.

51:33.000 --> 52:02.000
In fact, Niantic actually made a tweet and I don't remember the exact contents of the tweet but it was something it was a parody of a Rotten Tomatoes post that was saying going outside is rated 100% and they got ripped to show they had to take the tweet down because so many people were bitching them out over what had happened in Pokemon go. It seems very interesting that Niantic has willfully chosen at this point to not respond to the Pokemon go situation.

52:03.000 --> 52:20.000
They probably figured that people are going to forget about it. Like people have forgotten that they made a Monster Hunter movie and it probably was terrible. Just just this is your reminder that that isn't a thing that exists in this world that we live in is a Monster Hunter movie that probably nobody saw.

52:20.000 --> 52:49.000
I still feel like bridges are being burned that can't be repaired. And what I mean by that is like content creators, influencers and that sort of thing. I have some friends from the Dragon Con circuit that do a long running and I believe fairly popular enough at least it was when it was first out Pokemon go podcast. It's actually called the Pokemon go podcast that tells you how early on they got in there.

52:50.000 --> 53:13.000
I have been graciously invited this week on to what is going to be their last episode. Because they're over it.com and they want to take their chemistry that they have the two of them and do I believe I don't know all the details but I believe I saw that they snuck a backdoor pilot for a new show into their Pokemon go feed as podcasters sometimes do.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
Garfield go podcast. I'm so psyched. I can't wait.

53:43.000 --> 54:08.000
I'm actually frustrated that they're fucking up so bad. And what I mean by that is that the last time this happened, they literally promised, promised to communicate more with their fans and do these regular updates. Not only is their latest announcement completely not involving any of that.

54:09.000 --> 54:29.000
But like to go so far as to then not even respond two weeks later is like, kind of offensive. To be honest, a real slap in the face to everyone who stuck by them after the first time. Like Niantic I want to love you but you're making it really fucking hard. You've got to fix this.

54:29.000 --> 54:58.000
And I'm not saying you necessarily like have to reverse course on everything. But you've got to make commitment to do better and show it. And I swear to God, the thing that's the like the most damning thing in this whole thing. It's not even like the remote raid and all the time. I mean, it ain't cute, but it's not even that. Go look at the Reddit post. It's so well done. It is a parody post of a Pokemon go news update of all the things that have happened.

54:59.000 --> 55:24.000
All of the changes they've made this year that were rolling back things basically, and they did it all in one big parody post. And when you read that post, you're like, Damn, this game is scale. This game has made a lot of changes for the worst this year. Now, go look at the things that Pokemon go has given us new exciting this year.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
I'll wait. I'm still waiting.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I mean, there's probably some new Pokemon.

55:32.000 --> 55:53.000
Yeah, I think we got Bounsweet this week. We have a shiny Galarian Stunfisk. Whoopee shit. Like, Niantic I cannot express what and this is to gaming companies everywhere. Gaming companies everywhere need to learn a fucking lesson from this.

55:54.000 --> 56:04.000
You cannot announce these type of changes that are a downgrade in quality of life of your product. That's what it is at the end of the day.

56:05.000 --> 56:20.000
Everything we see in gaming, every patch notes we see, everything that rolls out is quality of life improvements. Your favorite MMO, quality of life improvements. World of Warcraft does not look the same today that it did when it first launched. Why? Quality of life improvements.

56:21.000 --> 56:46.000
This is a game that had quality of life regression multiple times this year. And what do we have to balance it? Where are the quality of life updates or positive changes or the reason we remove these things was to bring you these things.

56:46.000 --> 57:08.000
Not there. That is the, and again, I just did an Ingress event this weekend, but I'm going to tell you what, that was about the people. It wasn't about the game. That was about wanting the people I love to do this thing collectively together. It wasn't about the game.

57:09.000 --> 57:25.000
Y'all are on thin fucking ice with your community Niantic. And I'm going to be this bold. Sorry, I did not mean to turn this into a soapbox, but I kind of have to because this is like my passion in gaming right now. I'll play this Monster Hunter game as much as I'm sitting here bitching. Why? Because I love AR games. And that's just the way it is.

57:26.000 --> 57:38.000
They should just combine all of them together. We can get the NBA stars in there as well. We can throw, have them throw some Pokemons in the battle to battle the monsters and then some Pikmin will be there.

57:38.000 --> 58:02.000
I need to say Niantic. And I'm sorry, I actually know people that work in Niantic and might even work in this area. And this is why I feel like such an asshole. But this has to change. Like you have to be able to look beyond that and say Niantic must do better here. Like what is the worst thing? This doesn't change or the company goes under or gets bought by EA or something because that's where I feel we're headed at this point.

58:02.000 --> 58:31.000
And here's what it is. Niantic, you must rebuild your PR. You must release your PR team and you must begin again. You must change your public relations severely. If you can't do that, Catan, Transformers, Peridot, Monster Hunter. It's going that way.

58:32.000 --> 58:46.000
Anyway, yeah, and She-Hulk10 honestly with the bottom line in chat, they won't listen until you guys stop paying them. And that is what it's going to take. If you're pissed off enough about these Pokemon Go changes, you have two choices.

58:46.000 --> 59:10.000
One, uninstall the game and stop playing it and leave a one star review in the store. That's probably the biggest and best thing you can do. Two, if that really isn't something like maybe like you realize that the gamification incentivizes your own like walking and cardio and your own well-being and that whole type of thing.

59:10.000 --> 59:24.000
Then I would say the second best thing you can do is stop giving them money. Go free to play. Do that thing. Just it doesn't matter. The quest doesn't matter. The shinies doesn't matter. You have to be willing to leave that all on the table for this to change.

59:24.000 --> 59:51.000
That's it. Anyway, I didn't mean to be so boxy for so long. But it's just like, it's it's gotten to that point. Like I've just like I like two weeks ago, I was like, oh, Niantic. Niantic is gonna do this thing. And they're gonna say, oh, we we reduce the number of coins or whatever, like they're gonna, but like for Niantic to have done nothing two weeks after the fact, but unveil a new game to try to distract people's attention.

59:51.000 --> 01:00:04.000
You need PR CPR. Ooh, I'm gonna I want that phrase. You need PR CPR. That's what it is. You need PR CPR.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Let's move on to our soccer. Do you have a happier, more fun, fluffy topic for us? You're muted again. Just so you know, I don't know if you were eating.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:45.000
I had been. I had actually been making snorting noises. But, but, but no, it's, it's, it's not happy. It's kind of what's expected. What is going on right now is there is a survey that was put out. And the survey is about how, quote, older gamers feel more comfortable eating.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:06.000
About their representation in the industry. And this is actually a study put out by AARP, which is the American Association of Retired Persons. Or, you know, didn't we also see Wilford Brimley with them too? You want to know I started getting stuff from AARP when I was in my 30s and I wanted to cry.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I get stuff from them too. And I just throw it in the trash. I put it in the round file.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Well, at any rate, they of course support more than 38 million people who are over the age of 50. And people who are over 50 do make up a very significant number of gamers.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But the survey says that about 70% of players over 50 don't feel like developers notice the big, you know, portion that they represent. And I mean, if you think about it, you know, 50 year old gamers today.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:02:04.000
They were, you know, playing, you know, growing up with Atari, growing up with Commodore 64, the Apple IIe, the Coleco Atom, Coleco Visions, and just like, you know, we were littler when those were the big thing.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But they grew up with this industry. I like to say that we grew up with this industry. And you know, we're not terribly far behind those people.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:31.000
But about 45% of the people in the range say that they play video games at least once a month. Mobile games were included, but there are quite a few who are console and computer gamers.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Although a good number of them play Wordle. That's like the big one on there. They're really, really into it.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It says that older gamers prefer puzzle, logic, and word games and prefer using their mobile phones. But the number of console gamers among them has doubled to 28%.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So, and it's actually saying that more women are playing games than men in that demographic. 53% of women compared to 48% of men. I mean, if you're using a binary.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:26.000
But in general, over the main population, 52% of gamers are women as opposed to 37% of being men. That's total number.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:44.000
The math doesn't add up. So I think that there's like non-respondents and people, you know, who are non-binary maybe perhaps I don't know how I don't have the details of that particular one, but I knew that we were the majority.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And then the study also stated that the pandemic did not have a large impact among the older gamers. And there were small increases in the demographics within the over 50 population of gamers.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:19.000
For example, women, people of color. And they found that over the course of six months, the average older gamer is now spending nearly 3.5 more hours playing, increasing from eight and a half to 12 hours of average gaming.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So, and it's just, it's just really interesting, you know, and we don't really, I guess, think about, you know, what constitutes as old versus older, you know.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:50.000
We, and it's kind of hard for, I think, even people who are close to that to start, you know, thinking of ourselves as, as nearing that range. You know what I mean?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:04.000
But we are the ones who grew up with the industry. I mean, I, I mean, when people say, oh, 50 year old gamer, I don't blink twice at it, you know?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I don't either because, because of the fact we have grown up with video games, like, and, and, but we remember a time as kids that the 50 year olds would look at us and go, ah, it's a kid thing. Video games are for kids.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But obviously that perception has shifted significantly because now that we're the 50 year olds or, you know, within 10 years of it, like, we're the ones that grew up with the games now.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And it's not such a weird, I think more and more people realize whether they want to or not, gaming is for everyone. Right? I mean, the fact that-

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
There's not a stigma with it that we experienced.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Right, right. I think, you know, the fact that more women play games than men, that, that, that news has actually been out there for a few years now that to me, that's not surprising.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I'm sure to somebody whose head is, you know, in the ground, it probably is a little more, but that just kind of goes to show you like how mainstream gaming is. It is literally for everyone.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Yeah. And, and well, of course, you know, you also add in the, the, uh, the fact that we have, uh, more accessibility options for people as well.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Sure. I mean, I mean, heck, even Dead by Daylight just put in, um, a visual terror radius like they have in the mobile version for, um, for people who, uh, have hearing issues and they've changed, uh, like the way Spine Chill works where it's all visual as well without the audio cue it used to have.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But even, even things like color blindness and button mapping are like standard now, like it's, it's more rare you don't see a game have that, which is a good thing.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Yeah. Well, I think it's great, you know, but that's also opening the door to increasing the, the, the demographics to poll. Right?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Right.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So I think, and on top of that, as the, I don't want to put it so morbidly, but the oldest of the group are dying out. That's it.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That's what happens to humans when they reach a certain age is that they eventually cease to function.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yes. Older people are more likely to statistically cease. Yes.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Oh, and, and so, but you think about what's replacing that, that area. I mean, just cyclically, you know, I mean, think about interviewing people who were a hundred years old, for example, and, and knowing what they lived through.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I mean, people who were there for the advent of the car, or, or even, I'd say more like it's, it's earlier manufacturing days, people who lived through the depression, people who lived through all of this.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We're not having people who know what the world was like before certain technologies, you know, that's a constant cycle that's happening.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's all phasing out. All we have are, you know, the modern archeologists and sociologists keeping track of these things.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:27.000
You know, people who preserve, like, like, you know, why can we talk about preserving old video games, you know, but people who preserve the technologies and the understanding and, you know, reenact the ways of life.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But, but eventually there's going to come a time where there's not going to be anyone in a modern, modernized, what's the word I'm thinking? I shouldn't say modernized, but like in a more westernized.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I don't want to use that term either. I'm just going to say in a more technologically standard area that won't not know what a video game is.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Right.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And won't remember a time that they didn't exist. Because it didn't. For them, it never, there was never a time it didn't exist.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Right.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
So, I'm just saying.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:26.000
It is interesting, you know, you're right, as gamers just get older, because more people, you know, the average age of a gamer gets older because more and more of us grew up with them, kind of going back to what the story was all about, where there's many people that feel like an afterthought, you know, representation in games has obviously been huge for bringing more people to the table.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:38.000
That's why you see more, you know, women as the leads in games, you see more people of color, not saying that we've, hooray, we've won the battle. I'm not saying that, but I'm saying you're saying more than you did in the 80s, that's for sure.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
But we're the greater number and the least represented.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Right. And what I'm getting to is where do you see the games that have people over 50 as the protagonist? Does God of War count? I don't think he's supposed to be 50 in that. I just know he's old. I don't even think.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:18.000
And it's, it's funny, because even for like a long time, there's so much in media and stuff that where it's like, the folks are way younger. Star Trek. So Picard just ended, right? I'm not gonna say anything about that. But, but it has me thinking about the next generation and all that, right? Like, wasn't Captain Picard supposed to be something like 47 in the first season of The Next Generation? And it's like-

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Which makes sense for someone at that rank.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I guess, but you look at, you know, you're like, he wasn't 47. I'm 47, almost. It's just, it's just, you know, or go look at video games.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:42.000
You know, Final Fantasy characters are rarely over the age of like 18 or 19. And so many of them feel like, weren't they like in their 40s? Nope, they were supposed to be a lot younger. So it's just very-

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Look at it right now. Nicole Kidman is 55 years old.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Oh, wow. You know, like, when I stopped to think about that, that makes sense. But I go, she still doesn't. Well, I say she doesn't look it. What the fuck does that mean? What the fuck does that really mean? She doesn't look the way I've been conditioned to think a 55 year old looks like.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Sandra Bullock is 58.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Good for her.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I mean, and they can also, you know, afford, you know, surgery and injections. But I mean, they're, they're, people don't look like I think what their age is expected to be.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Yeah.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:41.000
You know, like, I mean, yeah, I dye my hair. I'm still not totally gray at the root. You know, my mom didn't go white until she was like in her late 50s. You know? Yeah, the Wilford Brimley was, was 50 years old when they did Cocoon.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That comment from Bobby Black Wolf and Chet.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Yeah.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Yeah.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But I'm saying that we need to stop looking at a number and having an expectation. I mean, it's not gonna, it's not gonna happen, but it's what needs to happen if I think if companies want to be inclusive of all of their demographics, you know?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Well, on top of that, I think, you know, wouldn't it be funny is that if we had games marketed to the true representation of the, of the number of gamers in certain groups?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Right? I mean, one thing about it too, not all of the female presenting character, you know, people out there want to play Barbie or...

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
No, of course not.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
There's a lot of dance who do want to play Barbie.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Yeah. Well, and like, oh gosh, when I was in San Francisco, I saw this guy with like a My Melody bag. I was like, oh, that's a cute bag. He's like, oh, it's my girlfriend's. I'm like, really? I would have had, I was like, if I was a dude, I'd have rocked it.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That movie is gonna make so much money.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Summer.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Oh, the Barbie movie?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
It's gonna make so much money.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I can't fucking wait for that Barbie movie.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
It's not gonna be from kids. Kids aren't gonna see that movie.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Gays rise up. Gays rise up. We're going to come out for that movie in a way that we sure didn't for Bros. Watch.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:40.000
But at any rate, the whole thing is that they need to actually pay attention to what people are playing in these different groups and understand that again, an age is a number and there's still going to be massive diversity and tastes in these groups.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Yeah.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:14:00.000
You can't just say, oh, uh, this person has these chromosomes, so they want to play this or, hey, these people are over 50, so they want to play, you know, uh, uh, sit and fish, you know, this game or they want to do nothing but play wordle.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:13.000
They, it's, it's appreciation, appreciating the diversity and embracing it and then marketing accordingly, you know, creating accordingly. Take a chance.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:23.000
You know, kind of a comment that fifth dream set in chat that has me thinking about all this stuff about like, you know, like marketing and who really are the cool people right now.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Uh, fifth dream in chat says I'm starting to look like Jack Black is honestly, if you're Jack, that's a compliment. Like who is having a better month in Hollywood than Jack Black?

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Who is, who in Hollywood is having a better month than Jack Black?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Uh, considering obviously the Mario movie continues to do bonkers numbers, number one at the box office for a third straight week.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I mean, granted, the only other big opening was Evil Dead, which I understand is pretty good, but it's, it's an R rated movie.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It's always going to have an uphill battle and it's a, it's a hard R as we say, those type of movies are always going to have an uphill battle against the family movies.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
It's just fact, right? Doesn't matter how good it is.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Um, there, there's that and just, you know, obviously Jack Black with his song is everywhere and you know, the remixes and all that stuff like Jack Black is, and it's interesting because Jack Black is probably over the Wilford Brimley line I'm gathering.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
He's probably the coolest fucking guy in Hollywood right now.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Even Mike Deft, who openly admitted his distaste of other actors, which I do kind of agree with earlier in chat says, Jack Black is a treasure.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I'm, I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the, ooh, she's different crowd where in chat, somebody did pipe up and say, I don't care for Jack Black, but I'm not seeing it yet.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So, so far.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But yeah, Quest Buster also Mario movies closing in on a billion in worldwide revenue, revenue, revenue.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It's wild and Jack Black is a big part of that.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And I don't see that slowing down anytime soon because like you have the, I think, was it, um, I want to say inside out, but it's not inside out, elemental or whatever like that.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Um, I don't think that's going to provide much competition for it to be honest.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Yeah, I, I, yeah, I think Mario easily makes a billion at this point, certainly worldwide, certainly worldwide guaranteed in the US.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Obviously I don't, I don't think it makes a billion, but I think even at this point, like 600 millions in shot and that's still, that's still really good.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
That's really good.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
So, uh, and Bobby Black Wolf confirms Jack Black passed the Wilford Brimley line in May of 2020.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Imagine if they'd gotten someone just as cool to voice, Mark, you know what, I'm not going to finish that thought.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
All right.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Well, he's having a good week or good month as well.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Some, some people, some people get lucky.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000
All right.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
But, uh, good, good discussion topic.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.000
A good thing, especially as you know, the real reality is we're closer to the Wilford Brimley line than we were at the start of the show.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And we're much closer to the Wilford Brimley line than when we started OLR.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Much, much closer.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
All right.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
What do you, what do you mean we're immortal?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Does that mean the only way we can be defeated is by having our head cut off?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I hope not.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Well, none of us will do it, so no problem.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
All right.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Let's move on.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Other things going on in the gaming world.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Pretty big, pretty big story over here, right, Logie?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Uh, yeah.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
So Sony is acquiring Firewalk Studios.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.000
They had worked on, um, probably monsters with them for a while.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:48.000
And now they're working on, I can't tell if this is another game also called Firewalk,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
but they are working on something to bring a modern multiplayer game.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
They said that's going to connect players in new and innovative ways.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Please be home.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.000
It's not home.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
It's not home.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Stop it.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Damn it.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It says the studio shares our passion for creating inspiring worlds, grounded in exceptional gameplay, and we want to continue to invest in their mission.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Cool.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Can't wait to see those games come to the Xbox platform, right?

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Mm-hmm.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Right?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Mm-hmm.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Right?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Because we're all about sharing, you know, IP with other platforms, because that's just ridiculous that you would just hoard a publisher or, you know, a studio all for yourself, right?

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:42.000
They obviously have an always online game that is filled with microtransactions and season passes that Sony, that is something new to the table that Sony really wants for themselves.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Cool.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Can't wait to see what that is someday.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
So.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.000
All right.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
We'll figure out what that is.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Well, something we'll be seeing sooner rather than later is Final Fantasy XVI.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:05.000
After all, the game did just go gold, and we know that there's going to be like a live event, and I wish I could go, but I can't take all that time off work.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:11.000
They're going to have a live event in mid-June to kind of launch it, and then, of course, the game is coming out towards the end of June.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Well, there's a new feature that's been noticed in Final Fantasy XVI that could be something that kind of changes things up a little bit.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Now, of course, we did talk about the state of play already, but you know people are analyzing and taking a look at that and, you know, that whole thing with trying to really dig into everything that they talked about at that state of play and try to see more about the game in there.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Now, side quests, big part of every RPG, right?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:49.000
The main character, Clive, can get a list of every available side quest with what's called the Alliant Reports in the Hideaway.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:58.000
But since you have to go get these side quests from the NPC that gives them, you're going to be able to fast travel to any NPC quest giver.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
So it's taking out, essentially, a mechanic that sometimes can just be, I don't know, sometimes an artificial time inflation or whatever they want to call that.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:16.000
But some are calling this feature a little bit of a game changer. You don't really have to hunt down a side quest to complete it. You go to the board and all the side quests are listed there.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Now, they're saying hunts themselves may not actually share the same feature. It wouldn't make sense if it did. You shouldn't be able to transport right to where the hunt is.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I imagine it will still work similar to how it did in Final Fantasy XII, but I guess we really won't see until we see the game come out.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But some are saying that perhaps this ties into the PlayStation 5's fast loading gig, is that since the PS5 does do fast loading, it's very easy to drop yourself in front of an NPC somewhere in the open world and this whole type of thing.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:58.000
So, could be very interesting. It is being noted that doesn't mean you don't explore the world in Final Fantasy XVI, it's just this optional content ends up getting a little more streamlined.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:06.000
It's a, dare I say, quality of life improvement. So, we won't really know until the game comes out, that's for sure.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Fifth Dream in chat says, I miss towns in Final Fantasy. You know, that was a big criticism of Final Fantasy XIII, which they tried to remedy in the sequel in Lightning Returns. Final Fantasy XIII-2 had towns and that whole sort of thing.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Certainly XIV has them, and XV has them as well. So, we haven't really seen if there's much outside of just these hideaways in XVI, or the hideaway in XVI.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Hopefully there is, but we don't know yet because the game's not out and we can only go off of what they show us. So, we'll see.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But yeah, I mean, that game is out in less than two months now at this point, I believe. So, we're going to get more and more info on that game.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Another game that's coming out in June, Diablo IV, going to be getting another beta weekend coming up. They decided to do an extra one because they want to test some more features.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:07.000
That game is about six weeks away from release, if you can believe it. And by the way, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, that's like three weeks away.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:26.000
So, here comes summer! But you know what, Dark Sakura, sometimes, you know what, screw all these new games, right? Sometimes you want to play some- this isn't a segue into classic game, I promise, but maybe it's a segue to a piece about a classic game, right, Dark Sakura?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Yeah, we actually have something about Skyrim. And it's not necessarily what happened, but what it illustrates about some of these games.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:51.000
So, a person who had been playing Skyrim for a while found a new weapon new to him. A kind of Nord Warhammer after playing for 9000 hours.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And apparently new things were added over the various additions, but he's like, I've been playing for 9000 hours and I never saw this. Of course, people immediately started saying, oh, we knew about this, you know, and then like making fun of them a little bit, you know, saying that, like, I played for a million hours and didn't realize you could punch people or something, you know.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:30.000
But the point of this is that it just brings out that it's- this is a game that's probably going to be nearly impossible to not find new things in, you know?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Especially if you add mods to it.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Well, yeah. But this is actually a unique hammer. It's like the- what was it called again? I'm getting the name of it pulled up because it's hard for me to read. The Honed Ancient Nord Warhammer.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And it was added with the anniversary edition. But, you know, on top of what other people have done, they've actually found other pathways through the game.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:12.000
There was a Skyrim player who found a little known path through the mountains that connects the central and eastern parts of Skyrim. And apparently not many people knew about it.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So, it's what you get for exploring, you know? And I like to think of this, this is a very interesting thing about this, is that it has very real-world elements on there.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:38.000
You know, having to take different paths and learning different areas and finding out where accessible paths are, you know, it's very, very real life in that way.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:48.000
And I think that it's, it's pretty cool. You know, just a game that's already this old is, you know, still showing off what it's got to give.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Almost makes me want to get back in there and play it because I never, you know, like most Elder Scrolls games, you kind of think you're starting on the main quest and then,

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Distractions! Everywhere! Cave! Go explore! And it's just like, you never, you never, I've never finished Skyrim because of it. So, that's not to say I haven't put many hours in Skyrim, but I just haven't finished it because of that.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
So, when I hear these stories, it makes me go, oh, I should go back and finish it.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
All right, Loki, what do you have for us?

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:30.000
So, the indie console, the play date has now surpassed 50,000 units sold and actually over 53,000 since it's released one year ago.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
And it's kind of a unique little console if you haven't seen it yet. It's all black and white.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:44.000
It's got, I don't remember the exact type of screen, but it's like one of the ones that's like on this old e-readers or whatever, very crisp and stuff, but also has a crank on the side of it as well that you can use in games.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And with it, you can, I believe games are like kind of time released unlocked in there as well, but I think you can also purchase stuff.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I know there's a bunch of stuff on itch.io that you can buy and import or sideload into it as well.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And I think they even have like a development kit and stuff that you can make games for the actual play date and stuff. So, it's pretty cool.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:19.000
But yeah, I kind of wanted to check it out. I remember they were kind of backordered for a while, but right now, you know, they are still backordered.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000
They're not expecting to be shipping more units until the later months of 2023.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And it's like $200. I still would like to get my hands on one someday.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
It's a good problem for them to have.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It is, yeah.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat asks, Pixel Poop's play date version, when? Oh, we'll have to see if YYRS has time on his calendar. I don't know if Loki is going to do that.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
You could turn the crank to poop.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Turn that little crank on a play date.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
It's like one of those, it's like the soft serve machine or something.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I don't know about that.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000
You're definitely leaving some soft serve throughout the park.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:15.000
All right, moving on to other games, you know, there was a comment said in chat earlier, Jaskren said, 2023 is shaping up to be an amazing year for gaming.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Dare I say, understatement, honestly, like this is a huge year for game.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
There's everything I've already talked about and I haven't even brought this up yet.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Another game that's coming out in June, a little game called Street Fighter 6 that we've talked about a couple of times on this show.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And there's a lot of new information on Street Fighter 6 this week.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
A demo came out just, you want to play a demo? Here you go.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:49.000
So, and it's actually a demo of the world tour mode, which means character creation is available.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And so, yeah, I jumped in and played a little bit of this and I laughed my ass off because there's a butt slider and you can turn it up to 100.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You probably saw it in tonight's intro and it just makes your ass look ludicrous.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Like it's so funny, but there's, you know, all sorts of, but I also, I love that it's very just matter of factly.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.000
You can choose that your, you can choose your body type A or body type B.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And then on top of that, and A is traditionally male, B is traditionally female, whatever you want to call it now.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But then the option after that is, are you male, female, human?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And you can choose that too, to go with whatever the body type is.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And I just thought that was really cool that, you know, you have that representation just kind of baked in right there.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
And then obviously when you get into character customization, you can make whatever, you know, looks you want.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
I thought it was a very rich character customizer, so it's pretty cool.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So the demo is out now for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
If you're on Xbox or Steam, you have to wait for this week.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:59.000
So April 26th is when that will come out because PlayStation will only reluctantly put things on other platforms when they happen.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000
No, this is a Capcom thing and I'm sure there was money paid and that's, you know, that's the business.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:18.000
One thing I really liked about World Tour mode, I don't know if you've experienced this yet, but you go and you make your character and you do some warmups and then you go out and like World Tour mode is literally walking up to people on the street and fighting them.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
It's awesome.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
And I like that it's not just people.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
It is, yeah, it's not just people.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:32.000
It's bringing that like Tekken silliness into Street Fighter is what I like.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Can bring me bring me the screenshot chat of Capcom's like museum on the there's like a plaque of all of Capcom's titles in there.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Somebody bring me that screenshot because I need to put it up on the screen.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Have you seen this Dark Sakura?

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:56.000
There's a really cool little reference to like every Capcom fighting game, like, well, I shouldn't say every fighting game, but I think everything that takes place in the Metro City universe, I think was on there.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So it's really cool.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
They have some cool little flourishes in there.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
So, yeah, yeah.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Somebody can dig up that screenshot.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I'll bring that up.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
But yeah, it looks cool.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Like, I got to be honest, like when I first saw the World Tour mode, like in the trailer, I was like, oh, that looks lame.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And now that they've kind of fleshed it out and show what it looks like, it's like, OK, no, actually, that's pretty cool.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
That's pretty cool.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Also, they have announced who the new fighters will be coming to the game.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Rashid from Street Fighter V, AKI.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I don't think it's Aki because it's like A.K.I is a new character coming out as well.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And then Ed from Street Fighter IV and V will also be there.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000
And of course, Akuma will also be there in spring 2024.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
All right.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I need to bring my girl back to it.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
OK.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Dark Tetsuya actually found this on.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
He actually posted this on his Twitter.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
So let me put that up there for Dark Sakura, producing on the fly.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Here it is, I'll make that a little bit larger.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:09.000
So this walkway in World Tour mode that mentions like Street Fighter, Final Fight, Street Fighter II, Saturday Night Slam Masters, Dark Stalkers, Final Fight III.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
It like shouts out everything through like it's like a little like time capsule type of thing.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
So I thought that was really cool.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Just a nice little touch to the history there of Capcom.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Gold star for you for finding that.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Yeah, I would actually I know you probably are building up a backlog of games yourself, Dark Sakura, but I definitely recommend that demo if you have a moment just to just to see kind of like how they've done it.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
It's very different from Street Fighter IV.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
It really is.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
So it's pretty cool.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I did play Street Fighter VI at TwitchCon.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Oh, right, right.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Just so you know how the game plays.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Right.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I'm sure I'll, I'll get a chance to.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Yeah.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:54.000
TigerCon chat saying Metro City is also the city for Final Fight.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Oh, yeah.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:02.000
I mean, some time ago, they've kind of married the universes of the Street Fighter and Final Fight.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Those universes.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:12.000
I don't know if it's been married since the beginning, but certainly since Street Fighter IV at least, but I think it was earlier than that.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
The guy with the car that keeps getting trashed.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Yes, there is.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Oh my God.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Oh, my car.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:25.000
And Saturday Night Slam Masters was in that same universe because Mike the Mayor was a character in Saturday Night Slam Masters.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I remember that.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000
You know, we were actually watching like old Game Sack today and they're talking about games that never left the arcade.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And one of them was Saturday Night Slam Masters 2, which played more like a regular fighting game.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I forgot there was one.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Yeah, well, I don't think it came out over here.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Ah, that would be why.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Still, yeah.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I wonder if any of the characters in that would have traits that are available.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
I haven't really played through this because I only really did the world tour mode.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But Bobby Black Wolf says they do have the esports commentator feature in the main arcade thing.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And you can even have the commentator root for your opponent and give them support when you destroy them.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Oh, I love that.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
That's pretty cool.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Tigerclaw says, I think Cody from Final Fight was in Street Fighter IV.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
They all were.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Cody, Guy, and Mike were all in it at some point.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Like, I think it was like DLC.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
But if you get to the ultimate version of Street Fighter IV, they were all in it.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
So, I think Cody was just in maybe the base or the plus.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000
But Guy, I loved playing Guy in that game.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Yeah, Poison.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
A lot of characters came over from Final Fight.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000
It was cool.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
So, all right.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Moving on.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Oh, Dark Souls 3 says he wasn't in Street Fighter.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
I thought they did put him in Street Fighter at the end.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
But I guess I could be wrong.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I think he was in Ending.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:51.000
No, he was a background character on, I want to say on Ken's stage?

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Well, in Dark Souls 3 it points out he was in MVC3.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
So, it's possible my wires are just crossing with that.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So, yeah.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.000
All right.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Anyhow, yeah, I was really excited about that demo.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I would encourage you all to check it out.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So, anyway, let's get into our next segment and take a trip back to the era of Street Fighter like one or two or maybe four.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
We'll see.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
No, it was more like three.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.000
All right.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Well, we'll get to it.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Let's do the bumper.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault when you're launching a new product classic and tell you about it.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Sorry, we had some audio leak in there.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
What is the Classic Game of the Week Dark Sakura?

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Hatofo Boyfriend.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And I thought I had done this.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I thought very for certain I have done this.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And I have not.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.000
So, we're doing Hatofo Boyfriend, my original stream game.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:17.000
At any rate, it is called Hatofo karashi kibo no gakuen to shiroitsubasa, which translates to Hatofo Boyfriend, a school of hope and white wings.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
It is a doujin soft otome visual novel.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.000
It first came out in 2011 for Windows and OS X.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And all of the characters except the protagonist are sentient birds.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Yes, that's right.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
They're birds.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:47.000
It was developed by a manga artist named Hata Moa's doujin circle, which is Pigeonation Inc.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And it is the successor of a flash game of the same name that was created for April Fool's Day in 2011.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:16.000
There is a free demo of Hatofo Boyfriend that was made with the famous Rider engine that was released later that year with a commercial release on October 30th, 2011 at Kometer 98 with an English version released February 2011.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
International remake was done by Mediatronic and Devolver Digital.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And it was called Hatofo Boyfriend HD in Japan, which came out on September 4th, 2014 for Windows, OS X, and Linux.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And then for PlayStation 4 and Vita on July 21st, 2015 in North America.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And then July 22nd, 2015 in Europe.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.000
And there is an iOS port that was released in 2016.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It's an interesting game.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
There has been so much more about it than just the game.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Like, it went from an April Fool's joke to a full-on franchise.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Seriously.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So the game itself is one thing.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
It has another mode that you unlock.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I'll go into that in a little bit, but it's called Bad Boys Love.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:32.000
And then there's the sequel, Hatofo Boyfriend Holiday Star that came out December 29th, 2011 with the English version that was released on Christmas Day the next year.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Apart from the main game, there was a webcomic that was serialized in Manga Life Win Plus.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Different supplementary materials, doujin works that have been released, four drama CDs, and an episodic web series as well.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
So we'll get into some of those in a bit.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:09.000
But it is an interactive text-based visual novel that has a branching plotline, as they do, where your decisions determine which of the multiple endings you'll receive.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:28.000
The title pun is a Waseigo word, Hatofuru, where they're basically Japanese language expressions based on English words or parts of word combinations that don't exist in standard English.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Kind of like having a portmanteau, but not quite.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And yes, fifth dream, san is the best.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Oto-san is great.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Oko-san, sorry.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But anyway, Hatofuru can be pronounced heartful, but it also is based on Hato, which is either pigeon or dove, and the creator.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:10.000
So it's basically set in a version of Earth that's populated by sapient birds, and the main character is the only human going to an all-pigeon school called St. Pigeonation's Institute, which is an elite school for birds.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
And she finds love amongst the birds.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:27.000
However, there's an alternate story mode called Bad Boy's Love, where basically you go through...

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:42.000
After you've dated everybody, gone through everyone's story, and this is not going to be a spoiler for a now 12-year-old game, you play through the story a certain part and then you get killed.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:51.000
And then the true story starts with the pigeons finding your body, and it gets dark.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:58.000
It's so good, though. The story is so good. You find out all kinds of weird shit about this world.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I actually never knew that plot twist. That's interesting. Wowee.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Really? I thought you watched me play some of the Bad Boy's Love.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Not the whole thing, start to finish. I try to realize the context. I certainly watched you play this on and off, but...

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Bad Boy's Love was, though, at the time, the longest stream I'd ever done back in 2018, I think I did it.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:29.000
But at any rate, it's like any visual novel to play. You click the mouse or hit a button, your enter key.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.000
You can save at any point in the game, which is also good if you choose the wrong path.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
And then you can skip dialogue and all the usual stuff from a dating sim.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:47.000
But you can name your character, but if I remember correctly, I think her default name is Kyoko,

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:55.000
which has to do with the peel sound of a bird, of a little chick.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:06.000
And so you go to classes. You have different decisions that determine who it is you're going to end up with.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:15.000
You can also choose which classes you want to attend, and they raise one of three stats, depending on your activity.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And those also have to do with getting a good ending for your love interest.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And to make the story advance.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:35.000
There were originally 13, there's now 14 in the 2014 remake endings in total, which is one for each of the main love interests.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Three extended endings for three of the love interests based on stat values.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:48.000
And one ending for the Gaiden story, Torimi Cafe.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And another ending if you fail to romance anybody.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
When everything is completed, you get pictures and documents.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And when you get all of that, you're prompted if you want to fulfill a promise or live a normal life.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
A normal life will take you through a normal playthrough.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.000
If you fulfill the promise, that's when you go to Bad Boys Love or BBL,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:25.000
where you can get to the plot that some of the stuff in the other standard ones foreshadowed to or referred to.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:34.000
There's dream sequences, there are memories, there are different scenarios.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:44.000
It basically transforms from a dating sim to a murder mystery, psychological thriller type of thing.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
And it's a very, very long, this actually makes the majority of the games length.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
The dating sim parts are really quick in comparison.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
There's changes to gameplay, the way the text is displayed.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Saving is disabled except at certain points in the story.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:10.000
So the controls almost changed a little bit more of a 90s turn-based roleplay during some of the segments.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Anyway, in the universe, I know I'm really going into it, but it's one of my favorite games, so whatever.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:23.000
In this alternate version of Earth where the birds have taken the place of humans,

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:35.000
it's a post-apocalyptic dystopian future where after a pandemic of a mutated strain of H5N1, bird flu,

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.000
that it's wiped out most of humanity by the year 2068.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:51.000
And so this counter-virus that was supposed to destroy the birds carrying it,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.000
instead backfired, and they developed human-level intelligence.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:04.000
And so there was war between the uplifted birds and the humans, and the birds came out as the dominant life form,

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.000
and most humans succumbed to disease.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:17.000
There was a human insurgency, and then many humans have been forced to live in the wilderness, be hunter-gatherers.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:30.000
And so after the open warfare ended, they were adjusting to the birds taking over,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:37.000
and trying to do more things for peace between the remaining humanity and the birds.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And there's these different parties, the war dove and the war hawk,

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.000
their symbols used to show factions who supports the humans, who supports the doves, who wants peace, etc.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:56.000
And so your character is invited to go to St. Pigeonations as a symbol of goodwill.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:05.000
But you've got different characters. You have Ryota, who is a rock dove, and he sometimes dresses up as a maid.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
I'm not kidding.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:15.000
You have Sakya Lebel Shirogane, who is a fantail pigeon and a snobbish aristocrat.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Then you have his half-brother Yuya, who is a secret agent.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:26.000
You have Nageki, who is a mourning dove who never leaves the library.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Hint, hint, he's dead.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Okasan! Yay! Okasan is the best, because he's fast and not very smart.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.000
He's only barely evolved mentally, and he's obsessed with pudding.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
There's Anjel Higurei, which is based off of the Luzon Bleeding Heart,

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000
and he lives his life like he's in a roleplay game, a fantasy game.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Kazuaki Nanaki, who is a narcoleptic button quail, who's a teacher.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.000
There's Iwamine Shuu, who is a creepy chukar partridge.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Hold on.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
This is him.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Wait, are you showing it on camera? Because I'm still showing the other game.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:18.000
This is my plushies.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I have a plushie of Shuu.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
I'm trying to get to it, sorry.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Here we go.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
This is Shuu, with his tie.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
This isn't great for the podcast listeners, Jamie. We gotta keep it going.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I'm sorry, but at any rate, now I'm covered in pigeons.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
You also have new characters, who is a javasparrow called Azami.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
She actually shows up in the regular story, but now she's dateable.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.000
And then Tori, who is a golden pheasant for the Gaiden story.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And so, basically, you've got all kinds of different systems to use.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:10.000
You can show how they would look like as a human, instead of as birds, and that's it.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
I'm not going to get into more of the story.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
The holiday star is definitely, you have to find out who's stealing Christmas stuff.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
But yeah, pigeons.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Alright, there it is.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Go ahead.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I'm just saying, there was a Kickstarter for all of this stuff.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So, I got in on it.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Alright, your classic game of the week.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Hataful Boyfriend, certainly one of the more unique games to come out last decade.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I would say games like maybe Dream Daddy or something happened because of Hataful Boyfriend's underground success of sorts.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I just think people like the quirky.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Yeah, people like the quirky.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Alright.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Hey Rob, I want pudding now.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Who doesn't? Sounds good.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Alright, let's travel around and check out some other rapid fire news.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Some other quick headlines here before we get back into what else is going on in gaming this week.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
So, Loki.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Yeah, so we have an announcement of a THQ Nordic Digital Showcase that's going to be happening August 11th.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:23.000
They haven't said what announcements are going to be made or talk about what games they're going to be showing.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:30.000
But I'm sure it'll be cool and I'll completely forget about it by the time it comes out.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
But I can't wait to see what games they have.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And then we got news that the indie game Iron Lung, which is some like indie horror game, is being adapted to film by a famous YouTuber and I guess now filmmaker, Markiplier.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
So that's supposed to be coming at some point as well.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
So that's interesting.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Right now they said that we know it's going to co-star Carolyn Rose Kaplan and he's financing the film by himself.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Wow.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
With that YouTube money.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Yeah.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
That's risky.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Alright.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Interesting.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Yeah.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:27.000
We have some stuff coming out for Nintendo Switch Online for the Sega Genesis.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:34.000
What we're looking at is we have Flicky, which is the bird game.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:42.000
We have Pulseman, where an electrified boy goes to stop a bad guy inside a computer.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
We have Kid Chameleon.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
We have Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.000
And yeah.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
There we go.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000
That's nice to see Nintendo is still updating the online library.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
So it's good.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Alright.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And then one more story for you in this segment that has to do with a 4.20 announcement.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
That's right.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
This was put out on 4.20.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I'm not sure what this series has to do with that holiday.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Maybe the date was just a coincidence.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000
But with Fast X, or Fast 10, if you will, because it is the 10th Fast and the Furious

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
movie that's going to be coming out this year in May.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Probably the movie that finally ends Mario Brothers Run, if not a little sooner.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000
This was announced to be coming an arcade 1-up cabinet that features the Fast and the

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Furious deluxe arcade game.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I believe dates back to probably the first game, honestly.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Or the first movie.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Maybe the second movie.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Maybe the second movie.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But this cabinet will have the Fast and the Furious and the Fast and the Furious.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
What was the other game that they made?

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Tokyo Drift.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Thank you.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Tokyo Drift.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Both of those games will be in this cabinet, which can be yours for $599.99.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
That's a pretty steep price for two games, but with all the licensing.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I mean, the Terminator game costs that much at first, too.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
It just makes me upset, though.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I mean, I get it.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Like, this is obviously a tie-in for the movie.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000
But, like, these games are essentially cruising USA.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Like, in Cruisin' World.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Can we get Cruisin' USA and Cruisin' World, please?

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Uh, you know, arcade 1-up still seems to be doing well, because they're, you know, they're

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
still making these machines.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
So, I mean, anything's possible, I suppose.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
But, uh, I think this is also a Best Buy exclusive, they were saying.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Because I think that's, or at least that's who's doing the pre-orders right now.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
So, um, but also, I don't think Target sells arcade 1-ups anymore.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I think they phased them out.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Walmart still has them.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Um, but I think it's kind of a little more limited where you can get these now.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
But I think they've still been doing well enough.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Like, I think they lasted longer than most people expected them to.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So, I would expect these machines to keep coming out.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
I still, I don't know who the audience is for this game, but, um, I guess, you know

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
what?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
There's some people that have some really impressive game rooms.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Yeah.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I gotta say, like, if they ever put out, because they did, like, a home version, if you will,

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:09.000
of the, um, Jurassic Park game, except it's just the full arcade cabinet, and it's the

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
full arcade cabinet price as well.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
But if they did, like, you know, a stand-up version of this, kinda, eh, not exactly like

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
they did Terminator 2, because, or, because the Terminator 2 game, they turned it into

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Light Gun game, which that game was not.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Um, if they did it kinda like that, I would have it down.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
All right.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Well, we're gonna travel around the world and find some games, fastly and furiously,

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
that will be coming out to a store shelf this week, or, of course, the digital store shelf

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.000
is very popular these days.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Uh, Loki, what's coming out in the US?

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Not a lot.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Well, actually, now that I look at the list, there's quite a bit.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:53.000
So, um, we've got, let's see, After Image, uh, that is coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch,

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000

Uh, we've got R-Type Final 3 Evolved on PlayStation 5.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Never put final in your name.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Uh, yeah, it's, well, tell that the Final Fantasy.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Uh, Stranded Alien Dawn on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Strayed Lights on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Uh, we have Trinity Trigger on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Uh, this game sounds cool.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Cassette Beasts on PC.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I want to say this was like Digimon almost, if I remember correctly, if this was the type

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000
of game.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Uh, we have, uh, Honkai Star Rail on PC, iOS, and Android.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Dungeon Drafters on PC.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:10.000
The Last Case of Benedict Fox on PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Live Alive on PC, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Mail Time on PC.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Uh, Mugen Souls on Nintendo Switch.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Omega Strikers on PC, Nintendo Switch, iOS, Android, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
One, and Xbox Series.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Protodroid Delta on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Ys Memoir, uh, the Oath of, or the Oath in Felghada, or Felg, I can't pronounce that.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Felghana, there we go.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I did it.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Finally.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
That's on Nintendo Switch.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Um, what else?

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000
We've got, uh, last but not least, uh, Star Wars Jedi Survivor on PC, PlayStation 5, and

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Xbox Series.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Well, I think I know why it's a busy week this week, because it's also a busy week in

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Japan, and it kind of goes back to that age-old question whenever I read the Japanese release

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
dates, and there isn't much on it.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
The question comes up, is it Golden Week in Japan?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Is that why?

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Well, here's the answer, actually.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Golden Week in Japan starts on Saturday, so it's April 29th, I believe is the first of

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
the many holidays in Japan.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.000
So, I think what you're seeing happen in Japan this week is very similar to what happens

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:34.000
in the US the week before Thanksgiving, and that is a lot of games come out because there's

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000
going to be a lot of time coming up to play them.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000
So, with that being said, we have a few releases in Japan this week, and I'm going to start

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
with the Nintendo Switch.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:50.000
On April 27th, Jinkii Infinity in regular and limited edition is out, as well as Temirana

01:55:50.000 --> 01:56:01.000
koku no tsuru tirohime tsuitenaki shidan, that is a large word, that is out in Japan

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
this week as well on the Switch.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Warhammer 40,000 is also out on the Switch in Japan this week, and Evermaiden in a regular

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
and limited edition.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.000
My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu Climax in a regular and limited edition.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Ys Memoir also out in Japan this week as well.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Fortress S also hitting Japan this week.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:33.000
And After Image, the deluxe edition is also out on the Switch in Japan this week, I think

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
in line with the US and other regions as well.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Moving over to the PlayStation 5 this week, we have Dredge coming out in Japan, World

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
War Z Aftermath and After Image.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Star Wars Jedi Survivor will also get a release in Japan on April the 28th.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:54.000
So, busy week in Japan this week.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
But then next week, of course, not much.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
So, over to Europe, Dark Sakura.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
There's a few.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:09.000
We have on the 25th, we have After Image Deluxe Edition for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
On the 27th, Bramble the Mountain King on the same three.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000
On PlayStation and Xbox, we have The Crown of Wu, Legend Edition, The Restaurant on the

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
28th.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:22.000
We have Star Wars Jedi Survivor for the same two.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000
For PlayStation and Switch, we have Mortal Shell.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Also, we have Crazy Chicken Cart 2.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000
For Switch alone, we have Toy Soldiers and Family, sorry, That's My Family, Family Fun

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Night.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
That's it.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Busy week.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.000
All right, let's move on and we have some more headlines for you.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000
And then we'll take your calls, if you want, over on our Discord server.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Which, whether you want to call or not, I would encourage you to join and keep in touch

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
with us throughout the week over at vognetwork.com.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Before we get into the next story, S. Joe and Hunter Matt commenting on Jedi Survivor

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:06.000
saying, I really want Jedi Survivor day one, but that 144 gigabyte install size on Series

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
X.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
I'm going to need to make some serious cuts to fit it.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Yeah, that install sizes.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Yikes.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
That's a lot.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.000
That's a lot.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Thank God I don't have Comcast bandwidth caps anymore.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.000
I'm so thankful for that.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Sorry to those that do, but anyway, sorry, Loki.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
All right, no Jedi Survivor for you.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000
It's only bad when the kids are home for the summer.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
That's when they start going, you're getting close to your bandwidth caps because they're

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
in there watching stuff, but usually it's fine.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
Well, that's good.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:45.000
All right, we have some other headlines to talk about for the week, and we'll go over

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
to you, Loki.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Yeah, so Stardew Valley is going to be getting an update after quite a while.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:57.000
It's been several years since the updates have been coming out, but now we have version

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000
1.6 on its way, and they apparently haven't said too much what's going to be coming to

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000
it.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Obviously, it's going to be a smaller update than the last one because the last one was

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
kind of a complete rewrite of the game.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Now, they said this one's going to be targeted mostly towards changes for modders, which

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:21.000
will make it easier and more powerful to mod, but there's going to be additional game content

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.000
and new dialogue, so we'll just have to wait and see what that is when it finally comes

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
out.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
You know, people hella mod that game.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
I was watching somebody on stream, one of my friends playing that game, and it was really

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.000
modded, so I'm kind of not terribly surprised they've gone back and added some more to it

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
because if they don't, the modders do.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:48.000
But that game's had a very long life, too, so whatever keeps the people interested, right?

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Yeah.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:54.000
And I mean, especially if he's making it so that there's more tools for the modders to

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
make even more amazing content.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.000
So I mean, he probably sees that it's just, it makes sense to try to do that because that's

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
why people buy the game.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
They're like, oh, man, look at this mod.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Buy the game now.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
So, yeah, of course.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
All right, let's move over to DarkSakura with some not so great news.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
Well, I mean, honestly, I don't think this is bad news.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Well, it depends how you look at it.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Yeah.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Yeah.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Basically, veteran voice actor James Carter Cathcart is also, is retiring.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Congratulations.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:42.000
He was the voice actor behind, I guess, the English ones in Pokemon, Professor Oak, Gary,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.000
and James and Meowth is retiring.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Well, okay, this is the sad reason.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:58.000
He's retiring after 25 years because he has an advanced form of cancer, but I say good

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:04.000
for taking the time to take care for yourself instead of working through it.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000
So he has an advanced form of throat cancer, which, of course, you wouldn't be able to

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
really do much.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:19.000
The cancer is treatable, but it didn't respond to chemotherapy.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000
And so they're going to take a more aggressive round around May 1st.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.000
So because of those treatments, he has to retire.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And honestly, I think that needing to do this, to take the time to treat himself and not

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000
try to push through this, who will try to work while they're in a terminal situation?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Oh, sure.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:05.000
I mean, Liz Slaton didn't tell anybody that she was sick until she died, except for the

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
producers on the Sarah Jane adventures.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I think about Chadwick Boseman was a huge recent example of that.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Yeah.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:17.000
So I'm glad that he's, and on top of that, I'm glad that he's bringing attention to this

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:23.000
form of cancer as well, because not everyone thinks of throat and mouth cancer.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
I mean, I hope he wasn't a smoker or something.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:37.000
But I'm glad that he's doing something for himself and see about getting treated and

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:42.000
coming back, I would say coming back to voice acting, but just coming back and living his

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
best life.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Did you run my chat over twitch.tv slash vog network, who I know follows all these folks

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
closely because of his own show, Anime Jam Session does clarify he was not a smoker

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
and he was planning on retiring before this.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
But still, you want that to be completely on your own terms.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:04.000
But I do agree with everything Jamie says about, yeah, you got to put your own health

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000
first, for sure.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
So I'm glad he wasn't a smoker.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
You know, just thinking about the stuff my mom's gone through.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.000
So, yeah.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
All right.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Take care of yourself.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.000
I am proud to hear him taking these steps.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
That's why I say it's not it's not a sad thing.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
He's doing the right thing he needs to do to take care of himself.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
All right.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Let's go to Loki with something.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000
When I retire, I'm going to play with these all day.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Yes, there's more Lego, more video game like that.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:45.000
So it's for Sonic the Hedgehog and there's they're going to be putting out for new sets

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
coming out August 1st.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
It's funny.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
They're like video game sets release.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And yeah, it's pretty cool.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.000
They've got this one set where I don't know they're calling officially, but it's basically

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000
you put Sonic inside of like a hamster ball type thing and you smash it down and it goes

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000
really fast.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000
You can make go through a loop to loop and over ramps and all that fun stuff.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Plus, they have a version of Dr. Robotnik that doesn't look completely stupid like the

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.000
last Sonic set that they put out because that model was awful.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
And now it doesn't look awful.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So that's good.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
But there's four sets in total.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
They have one with Sonic.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
They have one with Sonic and Tails with his airplane.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.000
There's Amy and some sort of animal rescue thing.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
And then, of course, the.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Well, the doctor Robotnik said, I guess, is coming.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I don't know if that's part of this main set here.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
It looks like it may be in the screenshot.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Yes.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Yes.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
So that's in the big set.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Or you can get a smaller set with just Sonic and not all the additional stuff, because

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I'm sure it's going to be pretty expensive.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But it looks cool.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Yeah, Lego sets, they are they do get very expensive, that's for sure.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Yes, this year 100 Matt is linking to a Twitter account that shows a leak of some type of

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Pac-Man Lego set that's coming out.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:08.000
And this looks pretty cool because it looks like it's actually a full little like arcade

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000
machine kind of going on in this particular tweet.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.000
I guess a leaked image.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:16.000
That's definitely only because I mean, granted, somebody could have photoshopped this, but

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
this would be a bit much to Photoshop.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
But yeah, that looks really cool, actually.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000
I like that Pac-Man Lego set, if that ends up being legit.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
But only time will tell.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Right.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.000
I've seen the links people will go through to fake something.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.000
And this this honestly, this is nothing.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
True.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
True.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Yeah.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
I guess you can do it.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I believe the guy has a track record, though.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
That's usually more important than anything else is.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Yeah, I'm just saying it would be a fairly easy job.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Yeah.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.000
All right.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
I'm moving on to one more story tonight.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:56.000
And this is another one of those when Nerd Realms crossover and that would be another

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000
leak.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:03.000
This is, again, coming from a proven Fortnite leaker, iFireMonkey, talking about a Doctor

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Who Fortnite crossover event where you will be able to get skins so you can play as the

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
14th Doctor and the 15th Doctor.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
If you weren't already aware, the 14th Doctor is extremely similar to the 10th Doctor because

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
of plot reasons.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
So you but obviously that will all lead in.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
He's only going to be there for a little bit to all make way for the new 15th Doctor, which

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
will be during the 16th anniversary a little later this year.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
But it sounds like a partnership with Fortnite will be a part of that.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:37.000
They're talking about a major in-game event and a two-week event with free cosmetic rewards

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
and, of course, additional items available to buy.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Let's see, a bunch of more information here.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
A TARDIS glider.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000
That's amazing.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.000
By the way, I haven't talked about this in my game of the week because I only played

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
like once or twice.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
I finally bought that Ariana Grande skin in Fortnite because they brought it back on Easter.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
So I played a Fortnite.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I played two Fortnites and I got like 89th my first game.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
But I did better my second game.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I was like 50-something my second game.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
I'm going to make Alan teach me.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
He's much better at Fortnite than I am.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
So he's going to teach me.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.000
I might play.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I would love to.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
What a fun collab stream.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.000
You, me, Alan, and we have to find another Fortnite or sometime to round out a team.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
That would be fun.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:26.000
So, but yeah, I would love to get a TARDIS glider for Ariana Grande.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
I can think of nothing that speaks to me more.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000
And there's also going to be an emote that uses the psychic paper from the doctor.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Some other free rewards, a time vortex trail, an emote with the sonic screwdriver.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
So that sounds kind of fun.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
So yeah, really cool stuff.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:47.000
And of course, with Doctor Who being very big in pop culture leading into this big transition

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
and all that stuff later this year.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Good stuff.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Also helping on the Fortnite front, just kind of like a side note here, because it's in

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000
the realm of Fortnite as well.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Epic Games made another acquisition.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
They've been acquiring a lot of studios.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Remember Harmonix?

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
That happened.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Well, now Epic Games has acquired Aquarius.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I'm not sure if this is the right.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Acrius?

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Acurious?

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I think it's Acurious.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000
They made, you probably know the game they made better.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
It's Horizon Chase was the game that they made.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.000
It was a very good driving game that they gave away, I think during a PlayStation Plus

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
month or something like that.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:30.000
They are based out of Brazil, and that's going to make Epic Games' first Latin American presence,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Epic Games Brazil.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And they'll be working on Fortnite.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.000
So I don't know if maybe that's working to maybe bring Brazilian pop culture stuff into

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000
the game, because I don't know how Doctor Who and some of the other things resonate

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
in Brazil.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000
There's probably some things that would be a little more localized, or maybe there'll

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
be some really cool racing stuff in Fortnite in the future.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Who knows?

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:58.000
In a statement, the executive vice president of game development at Epic, Alain Tascan,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.000
said, we've seen firsthand the impressive talents of the Acrius team in creating innovative

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.000
games that draw global appeal, and we're excited to welcome them to Epic Games.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000
With the creation of Epic Games Brazil, we look forward to tapping into the immense talent

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:15.000
the region has to offer and establishing our presence in Latin America.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Their last studio acquisition, by the way, was the prior mentioned harmonics acquisition

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
I mentioned.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
So there it is.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000
And with that, that is all these scheduled stories we had for tonight.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:34.000
So I do want to open up our phones if anybody wants to call in over at vognetwork.com slash

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Discord.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
I'll go to Loki in a minute to see if there's any last minute stories.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I do want to do a check in with the mailbag, but it's been a dry spell there for a little

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
bit.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
I'm starting to wonder.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
It's still pretty dry.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.000
You know, this does make the question, you know, this isn't the first time I've asked

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:54.000
this on the show, but I'm very curious about maybe new ways you all want to interact with

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
us.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I'm not saying you need to do the homework for us.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
You know, I've got my eyes and my ears open to what is out there, as I'm sure we all do,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:07.000
but I'm kind of with email clearly drying up a little bit, calls on Discord, you know,

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000
and this isn't, you know, it's just been for a couple months.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
We maybe have had one or two.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I'm kind of curious the way you all would like to interact with our program moving forward

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
in the future.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
You know, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
We're trying to get more voices out there to join us.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
So, if you have thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:29.000
You can tweet me, I guess, at, I mean, I like Mastodon more, but I do check Twitter, over

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000
at Mr. Rob Roberts on Twitter, if you want to get my attention.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000
You can, you know what?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000
You can send me a personal email, rob at vognetwork.com.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.000
You can also email the show, of course, every week, participate at orangesontrated.com,

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.000
but I'm really curious about your thoughts.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Orange Right is suggesting maybe we need a Discord thread with the Discordedon Question

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000
of the Week.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I'm open to that, a Discord thing, maybe, if people will use it.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
We just call it the social inquiry.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Yeah, the social inquiry.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I like that.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:06.000
So, I take it that, you know, there was a segment on the show years ago called the FUGL

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Question of the Week.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.000
It was Facebook and Google Plus.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
That will help you understand the age of that.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Maybe we need to bring something like that back.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I don't know.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So, we'll see.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I'm cool with that, but we have to call it our social inquiry.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
No one expects the social inquisition?

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Exactly.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
All right.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
All right.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Well, let me go over to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories tonight.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I don't know.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I think we hit on most of it, but sometimes I miss things.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Not a lot.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Just, you know, because of some recent changes to certain social media platforms, Twitter.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Oh, yeah.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:53.000
The Xbox option to share content via Twitter has been disabled because the API now costs

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000
$42,000 a month to use, and they're probably not having too many people that actually use

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
that.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I used it.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I've posted several screenshots for No Man's Sky, but that was the BB or BE times, the

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:14.000
time before that guy that I posted a lot of stuff to my Twitter from the Xbox, like No

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Man's Sky and stuff.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000
I used it a lot, but I'm going to put it this way.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I'm more happy with Microsoft doing this than I am sad about the lost feature.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
So, there's that.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.000
And actually the $42,000 was for a small enterprise, so Microsoft probably would have to pay a

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
lot more for that.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
But yeah, it's not worth it at this point.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Yeah.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
And it's actually very easy, and I've done this too.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
When you get the share, you can actually go into your Xbox app.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.000
And by the way, this is the same thing with PlayStation, but you have to enable it in

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
the PlayStation app.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000
So, if you've never done it, and I think it's only PS5.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:57.000
So, if you have a PS5, I would really encourage you in your PlayStation app, assuming you

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
have the bandwidth and all that stuff to handle it, but more people can benefit from this

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
than not.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Turn that on where it syncs your screenshots and videos and stuff to the app, because it

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
makes it really easy to post.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.000
But then my point was, in going to the Xbox app, you can actually go, and I just brought

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
mine up for funsies.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I don't even, which one is this?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Oh, it's Vampire Survivors.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.000
So, you can even see, like in my app here, here's all my recent Xbox game captures.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:30.000
In fact, let's go to this one, because this was me on the top of the leaderboard when

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Falling Plus by our pal YYR first came out.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
So, I have that, and it's very easy.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
All you have to do, you can hit, there's a little share button at the bottom, and then

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:45.000
you can share to your, you save it as a photo, and then you can post it on Twitter.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
It's very easy.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
It's just an extra step.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:53.000
But again, I'm happier Microsoft put their foot down than I am sad that they lost the

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
feature.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
So, yeah.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Yeah.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Dartusia says, I guess I have to reinstall Twitter on my phone.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000
No, you don't.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000
No, no, you don't, because I don't have Twitter on my phone.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I will put the app back on there.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:10.000
So, you save it as a photo, and then you can upload it just like you would anything else

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:15.000
to any social media platform, just in the web browser, in Google, or whatever it is.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
So, there is that.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Yeah, and She-Hulk says, it's great to share and post your gaming moments.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Oh, yeah.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
The way the apps integrate with the newer consoles is great.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:29.000
And I will point out, Xbox has the advantage here, because the PlayStation app deletes

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
it after 14 days.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000
That screenshot I just showed you is months old in the Xbox app.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
So, there is something to say about that.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Bobby, I do see we have a call in the green room.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
I want to get to that.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
But Bobby Blackwell points out Sony and Nintendo's uploads to Twitter are still working.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:49.000
So, no word yet if they are still paying the fee, or if it just hasn't hit them yet,

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
or what's going on with that.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
So, we'll see how much longer those features are still there.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
So, all right.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000
If that's all with that, then let's actually get to a call.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
We'd love a call here.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I hope I didn't guilt anyone to call again, but we'll see.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Hi, you're on origin sounds radio.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Who's this?

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Hello, this is AJ Twist.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Can you hear me all right?

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Yeah, we can hear you fine.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
You sound great, actually.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Nice and crystal clear.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
It's great to hear from you.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
How are you?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Doing pretty good.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Yeah.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
I'm busy.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I have a question I'm dying to ask you, but I want to know what you called in about first.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
I want to talk about Evo.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Okay, this is going to be on the same page.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000
So, let's talk about Evo.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
What do you want to talk about with Evo?

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I want to know your question first.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Okay.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
No, it's standoff now.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
You first.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
No, you first.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.000
You first.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Okay, here's my question.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Last time you called, or maybe it was the time before, you talked about Nintendo shutting

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:45.000
down the Smash Brothers tournament stuff and the whole mess that the panda and all that

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
created.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
And I remembered you had your weekly tournaments that you did with friends, and I thought that

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.000
was really cool and all that.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:57.000
So, my question was, Nintendo recently announced a live event in Seattle, and they mentioned

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
that tournaments were going to be a part of that event.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:06.000
So, I was kind of curious, like, do you care?

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I haven't even looked to see.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000
I heard Nintendo announced something, but I haven't even bothered to go look to see

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:14.000
what it was yet.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
I'm interested.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I want to see what they're going to do.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I want to know who's really running it, because I know Nintendo's done like a small tournament

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
before.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.000
I think it might have even been at E3 or something like that a few years ago when I think either

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Brawl first came out, or maybe it was Smash 4 for Wii or for 3DS.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
One of those.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
E3?

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Bitch, she died.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
For reals, right?

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Even that tournament they held, I think it was more of an invitational, and they just run things differently

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000
than how a grassroots tournament would have ran it.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000
I know there's a whole controversy, too, with items being on and certain stages being banned,

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
and I'm pretty sure they probably just ran everything open.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Stuff like that.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
That's what I'm really concerned about as far as how Nintendo would run an actual tournament.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Would they follow the rules that the competitive grassroots Smash scene follows, or would they

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
do their own thing?

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
I'll look into that later, because I heard about that.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I was interested in what they're planning.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Yeah, because that would lead into a question about, especially since we've talked about

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.000
burning bridges, and your PR needs CPR earlier in the show, and I was just curious, with

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000
all the negativity that Nintendo trying to do there, I was curious, are they going to

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
get some goodwill back by finally showing what they're doing for their own tournaments?

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I guess it's too early to tell.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000
We need to see the tournament first, and that makes sense.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
See how they're going to hold it.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Is it going to be open?

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Is it invitational?

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Stuff like that.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
All right.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Let's talk about EVO, then.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Yeah, EVO.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Like I said last time, I've been there a lot.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I've been there, I think, 10 or 11 times by now, over the past, I don't know, 15 years

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
or so.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I just want to share my experience, because last year was amazing.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Everyone was kind of worried about Sony, because Sony bought EVO, so they're like, you know,

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
they own it now.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000
But they're still letting the people who started it run it, though, which is really good.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
They haven't stepped in too much to change anything, really.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:31.000
But I guess Sony's more of a, I don't know what you would call it, a sugar daddy, right,

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:35.000
to get all the money, giving all the money to EVO so we can use it to spend it for whatever

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000
we got to do.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:42.000
So last year, going to EVO, it was the first year that we've been back in person, I believe,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
and it was the first thing that we got to see what Sony was going to do with it.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
And it was great.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:52.000
It was like a big convention, a huge, huge hall, a lot of stations.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:56.000
When you play, tournaments go over like about three days, a whole three-day time.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.000
But the first two days is really when they do all, everybody playing their matches.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:07.000
So there is 100 stations with like four monitors each so they can run the tournaments quickly.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.000
And then they have like a handful of stages for each game.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:15.000
So any big matches that were coming up with some of the top players that they were playing,

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:20.000
you know, they'll be able to play on the stage and everyone could crowd around and watch their matches.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I guess you can imagine it like as Coachella, you know, you have random stages and it's

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
like, oh, this person is going to be playing this game over here.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Let's run over there.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Which Sony's been to Coachella, actually.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Yeah, they brought their trucks there one year.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
I don't remember if it was the year, I think it was the year I went.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I went, okay, I went to Coachella, no shit, 20 years ago.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:46.000
We went to go see Bjork and the Chemical Brothers and Susie and the Banshees reunion were headlining

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
and it was a great show.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.000
But I remember Sony trucks were there showing off like the PS2.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Wow, it's amazing.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
How long has Coachella been going on?

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Oh, forever.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Forever.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Wow.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:05.000
But yeah, so Evo, not only is that part really great about it last year, but that was only half of the whole convention hall.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Maybe even just one third of it.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I would say the other one third of it was all like artist alley stuff.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
A lot of vendors there selling great art, random just products and stuff like that.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:24.000
And it's Evo, so a lot of stuff is fighting game related, which you don't really see too often in other places except for maybe like Street Fighter stuff.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:32.000
But being able to see Guilty Gear stuff, Tekken stuff, even Guilty Gear, that was all really cool.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:40.000
And then the other third of it was another smaller tournament called Vortex and they just hold whatever game they want to hold and see who signs up.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.000
And it's their own just side tournament separate from Evo.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:44.000
And that was another section.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:50.000
And they also had like Red Bull set up over there too. Red Bull's doing their own mini tournament too with random games.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:57.000
And there's a couple of other indie developers too showing off games that they had working on and stuff like that.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.000
So it really sounds like just a whole little fighting game convention.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Basically, yeah.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Or versus game at least, certainly.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Yeah.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:07.000
And then the bigger part of it too that I love was the arcade.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:11.000
They just had free play arcade machines there, a lot of them fighting games.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I think they had like DDR going on over there too.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
A couple of music games.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:20.000
And like Ninja Turtles was there too. A couple of those beat-em-up games were there too.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
And it was all just free play.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
So anyone could just show up and start playing a game.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:25.000
So that was awesome.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.000
And one of my memorable moments there with the arcade was playing Super Puzzle Fighter.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000
I saw a machine there and I saw some random lady there.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I think she was from Japan because she wasn't speaking really good English for me.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.000
We were just trying to communicate.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
But we were playing against each other and she was just kicking my ass.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:45.000
And then a little crowd showed up and I was like, all right, whoever's up next, you can take over.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
And then someone else took over and then more people started playing.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
So it was just like an old arcade vibe.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
There were people just challenging.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.000
But over Puzzle Fighter though, which was amazing.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:59.000
I even left for a little bit and I came back and one of those people was still there.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
And I was like, oh, let me get another game in.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
And still got my ass kicked.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:09.000
And then after she was done playing, the first lady that I started off with came back.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
And she was like, oh, can I play you again?

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
I was like, yeah, let's go again.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
So it was a good time, great time there.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:21.000
That's great, especially probably being the first big event for you in that community since COVID lockdowns.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000
It just kind of, absence makes the heart grow fonder, that type of thing, right?

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Yeah.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
That was great.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Before I let you go, I thought of another question for you that's very timely.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Since you are a fighting game fan and you've called in a lot to talk about that.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Currently, you have an opinion on all the Street Fighter 6 news this week?

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Not yet. I know the demos released.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I don't own any consoles except for Switch.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
So I'm waiting for a PC demo to release and I heard that will be next week.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Fair. It's next week, yeah.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Yeah. And I don't think there's, I don't think there's online I heard.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I think there's no versus right now.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I think it's only that open world.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.000
It's the open world. I think the arcade mode is really limited.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000
I have to admit, I haven't even touched it, but I think there's like two characters available.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Probably Luke or whoever the new guy is on the cover.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:13.000
He's certainly one of them because that's who influences all the moves on your characters.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
And then probably one other.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Oh, Luke and Ryu is all that's new.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Yeah, I think I saw a post about that earlier. That's right.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Yeah.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Yeah, if it comes out for Steam next week and there's a few more characters, then I'm interested.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Because I'm not really interested in playing Luke or Ryu right now.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Fair.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I'm waiting to try out, I think her name is Lily.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Well, they can't give it all to you or you're not going to buy it.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
No.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
But yeah, I think I'll buy it anyways.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Yeah, it's June's a big month.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Like, it is very strange that when I think of June in games, I'm not thinking of Street Fighter VI first.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Because honestly, any other year I would be.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:56.000
But this year between Diablo and Final Fantasy, I'm like, that's my bread and butter right there.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I almost, just a little bit, almost, maybe, depending on how the acquisition news goes, almost want to do BlizzCon this year.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I don't think I will, ultimately, because I just think there's higher priority things on my plate.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000
But like, what can I say? I love Diablo.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Yeah, and I'm also excited for Diablo II.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.000
June's going to be kind of busy between Street Fighter.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:23.000
I'm going to enter for Street Fighter VI at EVO.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I already signed up for that.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.000
And also Tekken 7, since Tekken 8 isn't out yet.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.000
And then I'm waiting for word of side tournaments happening so I can enter for Soul Calibur VI again as well.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
So that's what I'm looking forward to.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
And EVO's all in Vegas, right?

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
All Las Vegas, yeah.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Vegas is not that far. I need to go one of these years, honestly.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
So, one of these years, I'll get out there.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I'm not usually, like, when I think about the games I enjoy, I don't dislike fighting games.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Certainly. I mean, I'll buy Street Fighter VI. I'm positive.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000
But I just don't follow them as closely as other types of games.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
I feel like, oh, EVO's not for me because it's super competitive.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.000
But the way you describe it, where it's like, nah, it's just like a big convention of people who like these types of games.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
And I love the chill arcade vibe.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.000
I love, that's my favorite part of conventions.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.000
That's what I loved about MAGFest. That's what I love about California Extreme.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:16.000
That's why I want to go to Southern Fry Game Expo one of these days.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Just those big open arcade, Dragon Con shit.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I spend most of my con there, too. So, it's a lot of fun. I love that.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Yeah, it is. And it's also even more fun.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Like, if you, because last year, me and my group of friends all went and we all entered, you know, at least two different tournaments, two different games to play.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000
And I remember our first day, Friday, we had just a full schedule.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Like, everybody was playing somewhere.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:48.000
So, every two hours, we were running to like a different area, a different station, you know, for me to play a match or for one of my friends to play a match or, you know, just back and forth all day.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:54.000
And so, that was just fun. Just having something to do like every couple hours, go watch my friend get beat at a couple games.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:59.000
It was fun. So, at the very least, to watch people play is great.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Yeah. I'm going to have to make it out there. And it's not like, you know, like I could also do the thing where it's like I dip into EVO one day and then Alan is there and he'll be like, I want to go see a show.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Okay, we'll go see a show. Go have a meal. Go eat at Hell's Kitchen or something. Have a Vegas time.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Definitely do that. At the very least, like get a one-day pass. Check it out.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Exactly.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000
That's awesome.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:27.000
You know, the first time I ever went to TwitchCon was a one-day pass the very first year. That was our voiceover guy, Jason, said, you should go to this. You know, I was like, okay.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:35.000
And he was gracious enough to give me like an extra ticket or something they had. And I went and it actually completely changed my perception on Twitch.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
That's cool.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:46.000
So I want to try that someday too. Or at the very least, you can also do the finals match where you're just in the huge stadium, big screen and just watching top eight of all the matches.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Feeling that buzz.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Yeah, I haven't done that yet.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Wait, do I get to scream light the beam when they win like we do here?

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I think so, yeah.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Since all the Northern California teams are moving to Vegas, I mean, might as well.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
All right.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Well, there's options.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:12.000
AJ, thank you so much for sharing that and making me want to put room for Evo on my calendar, quite honestly.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Take care.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Thanks so much for calling.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.000
It's always a delight to hear from you and we hope to hear from you again.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:19.000
For sure.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:20.000
All right.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Take care, buddy.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000
All right.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Always great to hear from folks.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:29.000
And of course, if you want to give us a call, you can join our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
And please feel free to give us a call.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000
But with that, did we have any other last minute stories, Loki?

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Yeah, there was one thing.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:43.000
So basically that there's that new a golem game that's coming out.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:51.000
They're going to be charging with DLC to add more Elvish into the game.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
So the characters speak native Elvish.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
You have to pay money for that.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Because, of course, it's Warner Brothers and they're going to charge for everything.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Whatever happened to a fucking controller unlock code?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Remember that?

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.000
That doesn't happen anymore.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
We love a callback.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Let me call back to an earlier story.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.000
That's what the gamers over 50 really fucking want.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000
What do the gamers over 50 really want?

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.000
We don't need the representation in games as bad as we need.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Keyboard and controller, Chico, up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:24.000
You know the rest.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
We need those.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
You know they have to pay the voice actors.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Ah, fair.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
You have to rely.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000
That used to all be inclusive in the budget.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000
The voice actors already recorded their lines in English.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:43.000
And I get it that they taught them to speak in Elvish where they had them record additional lines.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:48.000
But that's just part of the budget of the game then.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
They're just piece-paling it.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.000
If the game's already released and they're making additional content for it, then...

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000
It's not out yet.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Oh.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:00.000
They're releasing DLC prior to the game coming out.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Or they're saying that it's basically pre-order, paid unlock nonsense.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:08.000
It's just...

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Then don't record it.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:17.000
If it's a thing that's going to cost extra money, you either include it in the budget or you just don't do it.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
You don't sell it separately.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:26.000
That'd be like saying, oh hey, we have language options in the game, but those are going to cost you.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
That's dumb.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Think of it like when you go to buy a new car and you're adding options to it, I guess.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Or if you are having a house built and you want the extra big closets.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Well, but think about when you buy a Blu-ray and you can change the language track.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:51.000
So there's also cases for the other, yeah.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:30:01.000
If you want to go the car equivalent, that's the equivalent of them having seat warmers in their car, but you have to pay a monthly fee to use those seat warmers.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
That's a fucking thing they do.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:06.000
What is Sirius XM? What is that?

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:09.000
There's other things, too, that are more egregious.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:18.000
It's basically because they don't want to ship multiple SKUs, so they're like, ah, we'll just disable it, even though the functionality is already there.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
It's in the code. It's paid unlock.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Capcom used to do that because it's easier for the consumer.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I would say it's a matter of time before people start hacking their cars, but I would say that, but that's already happening.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Of course it is. Of course it is because of the internet.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:39.000
That's stupid because people don't agree with it, so of course they're being motivated.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:42.000
But then again, that's also a problem for people to buy really expensive cars.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Just don't buy those cars then.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:56.000
It's not like something they can patch into it unless you're probably Tesla or something like that, but your normal car that you have now isn't going to all of a sudden one day start demanding money for windshield wipers or something like that.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Can you imagine? The deposit quarter to run windshield wipers.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
You don't drive a Fiat.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:10.000
All right. With that, we're going to wrap up and get on out for the night.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Thank you as always though for listening to our show and downloading.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
We appreciate you all being here.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.000
If you enjoyed what you heard, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out here on air.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:29.000
So a nice five star review on iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Speaking of Spotify, they have places where you can leave feedback now, and I'm just saying I did find out how to go read those.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.000
So for you Spotify folks, if you want to say hello or whatever.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Found out how to read.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I learned how to read.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:52.000
I realized, oh, you need to log into the Spotify podcast portal and you can see all that in one convenient place instead of having like, is this episode have one?

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Does this episode have one?

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
So you can kind of go through and see that.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
So I will see those.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Maybe that's where we need to solicit feedback.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
I don't know.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Because people use all sorts of podcast apps.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I don't want to limit it.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Spotify cannot have exclusive features unless they pay us.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000
But if you do want to leave feedback, that is one option to do it.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
I think that's really it.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Otherwise, I think we're going to go around and give everybody's final thought and wrap it on up and do this again in seven days.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
So I will go to Dark Sakura.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:26.000
I will not have Gwen or Fixie tonight.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
I may have Shayla later.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:34.000
So if anybody wants to play some survivor rounds with me, you're welcome and invited.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
All right.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Killer matches. I've been playing killer lately.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
It's kind of fun.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I've got a couple of dailies to do, but they're on characters I've already adapted.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I might just do them because, I mean, it's easy.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
It's like Doctor and Freddy.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Oh, Doctor gets the easiest ones.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:55.000
This is so easy.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000
And Freddy, too.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
I mean, all you have to do is just chase people.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Oh, that's easy.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Nice.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.000
All right.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:02.000
We'll have a good stream, Dark Sakura.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000
We'll talk to you later.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Bye.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Moving over to Loki and your final thought tonight.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I'm just going to be busy again.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:12.000
Busy this week with more Minecraft stuff.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
It's like a broken record.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
As always.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000
My final thought.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000
I have a very, very, very busy week at work this week.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.000
It's going to be very good that this is like a mountain.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I have a big project that is getting its delivery to a big audience this week.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I don't love to talk about my day job on places like this, but that's all I'm going to say.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
So I needed your thoughts and prayers.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000
I need all of that.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Whatever it is you've got for me, give it to me.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000
And I do hope to be doing some streaming this week again.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster is calling my name.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.000
So I'll see you guys on stream later this week, for sure.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.000
That does it.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
That does it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Thank you all for being here.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
I hope you all have a fantastic week.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Happy gaming, whatever it is you're playing.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:59.000
Or if you're just looking forward to June, or probably May,

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
and the release of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Honestly, that's the first one.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
That's the first crack in the dam.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.000
We'll be excited for all that stuff.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
And I hope you have fun playing whatever it is this week.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000
We'll see you in seven days.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Have a great week, everybody.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Goodbye.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:18.000
