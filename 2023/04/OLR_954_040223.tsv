0	13680	Samba de Amigo Party Central is going to have Escape from the City and I am immensely
13680	14720	excited about this.
14720	17680	The article doesn't specify which version it is, I'm holding out hope it might be
17680	20960	the Cash Cash or Blue Blur remix from Sonic Generations, but I expect it's going to
20960	23000	be the original version from Sonic Adventure 2.
23000	26640	For a game that revolves around Samba thematically and dance generally, it's a toss up as to
26640	28720	which version would be considered best for the game.
28720	32160	This is your Byla Byla update, now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers
32160	34920	and Loki to tell you the other detail from that article and the rest of the week's
34920	35920	gaming news.
35920	39920	Starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
39920	45840	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
45840	48560	where every gamer has a voice.
48560	50960	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
50960	58640	We are live once again tonight, April the 2nd of 2023 with episode number 954 of our
58640	59640	show.
59640	64240	I'm very thankful it is April the 2nd, that way you all know no April Fool's jokes
64240	67160	on tonight's show because that holiday is silly.
67160	73880	I would like to see April Fool's Day become April Memes Day where you save your best meme
73880	76960	for the whole year and then unleash the memes on that day.
76960	79040	That's what I think we should change.
79040	82060	What do you think, Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers, who's here every week?
82060	83060	Memes Day, who's in?
83060	84060	Cool.
84060	90040	I did nothing but memes for like five years all about Mass Effect.
90040	91040	There you go.
91040	92040	I can do this.
92040	94080	You've got a stock ready to go.
94080	96800	And then that way people aren't believing fake news.
96800	100920	I can't tell you how many things I saw posted on Facebook yesterday where it was like, did
100920	103040	you not check the calendar?
103040	105160	No RuPaul is not leaving Drag Race.
105160	109040	I know, but to anybody out there listening who did.
109040	111840	I saw very little on Twitter, come to think of it.
111840	112840	Really?
112840	117680	I think that just a lot of the people I know are like, April Fool's Day is bullshit and
117680	119720	just don't participate anymore.
119720	120720	Yeah, yeah.
120720	126040	I think there's kind of just like a whole generation out there that just is over April
126040	127800	Fool's Day, quite frankly.
127800	130080	You know what April 1st is?
130080	132360	The beginning of my birthday.
132360	133360	Your birthday month.
133360	140640	My birthday month, which I celebrate all month because me being alive is a gift to the universe.
140640	142640	We'll also say hello joining us every week.
142640	143640	Another gift to the universe.
143640	145200	Say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
145200	146200	Hello.
146200	147200	Hi, Loki.
147200	148200	How are you?
148200	149200	I'm fine.
149200	150560	Are you a big April Fool's Day fan?
150560	154680	I'm a fan of consuming April Fool's stuff.
154680	155680	Yes.
155680	156680	Okay.
156680	157680	All right.
157680	158680	Fine.
158680	159680	How about April Memes Day?
159680	160680	I mean, yeah, that'd be cool.
160680	163440	Like a Meme Oscars or something like that.
163440	164440	The Meme Oscars.
164440	165840	I love it.
165840	166840	The best.
166840	167840	The best.
167840	172080	We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, at
172080	176880	the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash vog network, where you can chat along with
176880	177880	our show.
177880	180880	Or tonight, the listeners being very generous right now.
180880	183080	We're all the way up to a level six hype train.
183080	184840	Loki, you had a lot to do with that.
184840	188440	You just gave out like 15 gift subs in chat, so thank you very much and thanks to everybody.
188440	193280	I will always ... Because we are taping a podcast here, I usually don't read out all
193280	196880	of those acknowledgements until the very end, but if you're here until the end, I will absolutely
196880	197880	shout all that out.
197880	202160	It also scrolls along the bottom of the screen, like a little CNN news ticker or something,
202160	207000	so please know we love all you guys that go the extra mile with your participation.
207000	209120	Speaking of participating, hmm.
209120	210720	I just have to point out who's in chat today.
210720	215440	Well, I was actually going to read a comment from Shayla in chat who says, I have coffee
215440	216560	and it woke me up.
216560	217800	It has the extreme caffeine.
217840	222880	Well, that makes two of us, Shayla, because I'm drinking coffee here as we're getting
222880	225440	started here at the top of the show, as I tend to do, so.
225440	228360	Shayla is infamous.
228360	229360	From your stream, yeah.
229360	233120	From our team, Yeet, as the queen of chaos and the killer tamer.
233120	238920	Yeah, she really cracked me up the way ... Because I lurk in your stream and I think I even played
238920	239920	games with Shayla.
239920	240920	I'm almost positive I did at one point.
240920	241920	Yeah, I think you might have.
241920	245840	Just running up and trying to boop the killer and do all those things, just you know.
246600	250120	My impersonation of Shayla, I love you.
250120	251120	That's good.
251120	252120	That's good.
252120	253120	I love you.
253120	254120	Boop.
254120	255120	I love you.
255120	256120	Morimi.
256120	257120	Come over.
257120	258120	Morimi.
258120	259120	Morimi.
259120	260120	All right.
260120	261120	Anyway.
261120	262120	Hence the reason I made that particular shirt.
262120	264120	The Morimi shirt is all about Shayla.
264120	269400	Andrew 200 Matt in chat says, would have thought Rob would have brought the tea for tonight's
269400	270400	E3 talk.
270400	271400	Well, you know what?
271400	273200	It's all the same mug at the end of the day.
273200	274200	Oh.
274200	276360	Oh, we have that topic to get into at the start of the show.
276360	277360	Do we?
277360	281680	Well, what a lovely segue into our kickoff topic for tonight.
281680	286440	Look, all of you that listen to this show, I'm sure many of you follow what's going on
286440	291120	in the industry, so this news isn't going to come as a shock, but we're going to talk
291120	292120	about it.
292120	293600	I am completely shocked.
293600	296880	I may have a thing or two to say about this that might shock you.
296880	302080	So, Loki, what's the big headline on everyone's mind this week?
302160	307520	So first the news came out from IGN, from inside sources that said, hey, E3 is done
307520	312920	or E3 has been canceled this year, probably because everybody's leaving E3.
312920	316800	No one's actually, you know, displaying their games there.
316800	325760	Then prompted from that kind of reveal or scoop or whatever, the ESA or on the E3 accounts
325760	329600	basically said, hey, read pop and entertainment software association have announced that both
329600	334120	the digital and physical events for E3 2023 are canceled.
334120	340040	And then they did like an interview, I think, with I forget which site had a game industry
340040	349280	biz talking about the reasons they were blaming COVID-19 and a bad economy for some of the
349280	353520	reasons for the cancellation.
353520	356400	I mean, we knew that they would do that.
356400	360640	Did I not see the author of that article respond to you on Twitter going, it is not
360640	364080	COVID-19, it is not COVID-19.
364080	367600	I'm almost positive I saw that reply on Twitter somewhere.
367600	373280	But regardless, that is certainly something they're pointing at as a reason amongst several
373280	377560	reasons with what's going on and certainly was a reason that they haven't done the show
377560	382400	for the past few years, including last year when most shows were coming back.
382400	387480	Whether it was a good idea or not with the pandemic going on, that's another discussion.
387480	392280	But most shows were coming back, E3 did not and said it was COVID-19, even though that
392280	397920	didn't seem to stop most of the other shows last year, but it is what it is.
397920	402000	And I do see some comments in chat, Shayla is asking, what is E3?
402000	403000	Kind of less familiar.
403000	405880	And to be fair, there hasn't been one since 2019.
405880	409800	So we're going on four years now, there hasn't been an E3.
409800	416600	So once upon a time, there was a trade show that was created for the gaming industry.
416600	419580	It was where work becomes fun.
419580	420580	That is E3.
420580	424720	And it was a chance for the game industry to get together and show off the games that
424720	426920	they're making to retailers.
426920	431820	Also because, you know, people from Montgomery Ward would come to the show and Kmart would
431820	437620	come out to E3, I said once upon a time, for what they're going to stock their shelves
437620	438620	with this year.
438660	443740	Bobby on his show tonight was showing an ad from 1998 that was talking about Pokemon and
443740	448500	how they were selling that to Toys R Us the first time, you know, this trade show was
448500	449500	going on.
449500	452180	And so it was a place for the industry to get together.
452180	456100	And then, you know, it might be, let's go out and have some drinks and have some gnarly
456100	462140	parties and, you know, just get together in the industry and do things and all that stuff.
462140	467460	Google at the booth babes, you know, they would always like, it was the misogynistic
467460	472160	like kind of take on the whole thing that they just had to plaster that around as well.
472160	477620	There was absolutely, especially in the early years, that mindset of the quote unquote boys
477620	482780	club that the video game industry was, and some would say still is, although there's
482780	487060	kind of treated it like a hot red show almost like it's like trying to get people to come
487060	488060	to their booth.
488060	492020	Now, I'm not going to razz E3 for that because they came a long way in the later years.
492020	496460	So forth, you know, they progressed with the rest of the industry that has nothing
496460	501060	to do with the reasons why they're no longer around as a show.
501060	506140	But what ended up happening as time went on, this thing out there got more and more popular
506140	510940	and it's called the internet and they would bring it into your house with cable, you know,
510940	515420	used to dial into it, but you know, that only let the internet move so fast.
515420	520860	But once they started bringing in the internet and cable lines, you could get video on demand.
520860	523740	You could watch video on demand, much like you're watching TV.
523740	526460	Actually, I think that's what y'all are doing right now with this very program.
526460	529700	I mean, you might be listening to it on the podcast feed, but that's a very similar sort
529700	531180	of thing, right?
531180	536860	And this is what started happening to E3 is that E3 just got televised at home and all
536860	541060	those trailers broadcast right into your home and everything there, there ended up being
541060	544980	less and less of a reason to actually go to E3 because more and more of it you could experience
544980	546840	from your couch.
546840	551600	Did my grandpa tell you a story about E3 2010?
551600	552600	Maybe 2012?
552600	561800	It was one of those years I went and I had to justify at the Ubisoft booth why I deserved
561800	564200	a ticket to see their little show.
564200	566440	Like oh yes, I have a long running podcast.
566440	569160	Yes, we have XYZ number of listeners.
569160	570160	Yeah, we do.
570160	573440	You know, and basically, you know, somebody's being very skeptical like, I don't know.
573440	574440	Okay.
574440	580800	And then they let me in to a half empty theater and I get to see a trailer for the new Assassin's
580800	583440	Creed game, which granted looks really good.
583440	585560	And I saw a trailer for a bunch of other games.
585560	592920	I go back to the hotel that night and I see on YouTube the exact same trailer that I had
592920	596640	to justify why I should get into the theater to see.
596640	601200	That was the moment Rob Roberts started to realize this show really isn't what it used
601200	606400	to be and that the things that we experienced at the show and what's behind closed doors
606400	609480	and all that ain't what it used to be.
609480	613080	And Tiger class said, yep, once the internet became fast enough, it was like you were actually
613080	614080	there.
614080	615080	Yeah.
615080	618520	And then you had television networks on cable that were broadcasting 24 seven sorta, but
618520	622900	for the most part all day long from that experience, et cetera, et cetera.
622900	630120	So the show started to basically lose its relevance as a news breaking sort of thing,
630200	636520	which is what E3 became known for over the years, even though E3 was supposed to be a
636520	640640	trade show for the industry to get together and wheel and deal.
640640	646440	But unfortunately at the same time, the internet was ruining this element of the conversation.
646440	650100	Do you remember back earlier when I was telling this story, I mentioned some of the retailers
650100	656440	that would go Montgomery Ward, Kmart, what happened to all these retailers?
656440	661300	They're also less of relevance that they used to be because of this little thing called
661300	667200	the internet and be it direct purchasing, direct to your house deliveries, all of those
667200	668200	types of things.
668200	673400	I'm not saying that places like GameStop, Target and places you can walk in and get
673400	677440	physical games don't exist anymore, but I think you all know it looks a lot different
677440	682620	in the year 2023 than it used to hell even in the year 2019 and certainly versus the
682620	687900	year 2006, which was the last like epic E3 type of year, basically.
687900	690180	Yeah, thank you, Bobby.
690180	693600	When we say theater, we mean like a theater built into a booth.
693600	697380	So it's like, yeah, four wall, it's a mini theater.
697380	699860	It's like Black Wolf Manor's basement theater.
699860	700860	It was like that.
700860	701860	Okay.
701860	705220	When you go to an electronic store and they have like, here's the demo set up for our
705220	708060	surround sound system theater type of thing.
708060	709500	And Shayla, don't apologize.
709500	715240	Of course you're learning, but you're also bringing up a very, very important point.
715240	721000	Unless you'd gone to E3, your brain was left to fill in a lot of the gaps on these sort
721000	722260	of things.
722260	727420	So when you were talking about going to the Square Enix theater to see the Final Fantasy
727420	731980	13 versus trailer, and you're reading about that in a magazine, a lot of people are reading
731980	736580	out thinking, Ooh, they have a whole theater there on the floor.
736580	737580	Wow.
737580	740500	This place must be big.
740500	743620	I was breaking into my Jennifer Coolidge there for a little minute.
743620	744620	Wow.
744620	746100	Dish Avantage, big.
746100	747100	Just like my exes.
747100	748100	Oh, forget it.
748100	749100	Anyway.
749100	752780	One of the issues with E3 and those who can attend it can relate to says Tiger Claw is
752780	754940	the long longs just to try out a demo.
754940	755940	Yes.
755940	756940	Very that.
756940	757940	Well, yeah.
757940	762580	And then, and then on top of that, like even when you go there, it seemed like, you know,
762580	767100	it was hard to keep track of like everything that you can't see everything in time.
767100	769780	And even if you knew like what you wanted to see and you could get through all the lines
769780	773560	and stuff, it's hard to keep track of like everything that's going on because you're
773560	774620	there in person.
774620	781180	Whereas if you're on the Internet, you can just digest it on any number of gaming websites
781180	785380	that have all the headlines that they've been sent pre, you know, in advance by these game
785380	786380	companies.
786380	787380	Pretty much.
787380	790140	I mean, it's been that way.
790140	795140	Critch Peacefuzz in chat, HiHi says, I thought it was the studios that killed E3 who pulled
795140	798260	out, made their own event with hookers and cocaine.
798260	802740	I was just about to tell the Nintendo Direct starting this trend.
802740	808180	The Nintendo Direct was very much a beginning of the end and then Sony realized it could
808180	809300	work for them as well.
809300	814540	Now, I wouldn't necessarily attach hookers and cocaine to Nintendo.
814540	819360	But there's a certain part of the dark side of these trade show cultures that you all
819400	826320	have read about, unfortunately, that doesn't exist when you do the direct approach online
826320	829640	because people aren't gathering in a place and so forth.
829640	835280	So anyway, Loki, did you want to continue?
835280	839160	I know we've kind of got to, but I know maybe you want to talk a little bit about what's
839160	841440	next and that sort of thing.
841440	847080	So well, one of the things like, so they mentioned COVID-19, not necessarily COVID-19 as in the
847080	851600	disease itself is causing people not to attend or something like that.
851600	859320	It's more of that they're saying that COVID-19 altered the way studios develop games, I guess,
859320	863560	because now they're doing it remotely, you know, whereas they're maybe their release
863560	866840	schedules slowed a little bit because of that.
866840	871440	I mean, maybe like in the first year, but like, you know, this many years afterwards,
871440	872440	adapted.
872440	877020	I mean, I think Yeah, I think by now three years like if you haven't adapted yet to
877540	883140	being remote or working remotely, you're just not going to succeed as a business because
883140	884140	you have to adapt quickly.
884140	888740	You can't just take Oh, well, what's gonna take us like 10 years to adapt to this.
888740	893940	So I don't necessarily buy I think it's more of a situation where, sure, they're going
893940	894940	to blame all that.
894940	896740	So they're not going to say, well, it's because we're irrelevant.
896740	900220	I mean, they're not going to say that at all, obviously.
900220	905660	It's because these studios have figured out that, hey, one, we don't have to pay the you
905660	912820	know, this expensive cost to set up a booth at this event, and have to share the spotlight
912820	918940	with all these other studios, we could spend a fraction of that, set up our own event where
918940	923740	all eyes are on us, and just do whatever we want with it.
923740	925940	And I think that's just makes more sense.
925940	930780	It's less manpower for them to do all this, it's less cost for them to do it.
930780	932600	And it's more of a return out of it.
932600	937480	So of course, that's why the industry is going the way that they're going.
937480	941400	That said, though, like, it's also funny to see them compare, you know, compare this stuff
941400	946800	to, you know, COVID-19, and all its other tribute, all that, but then you have like,
946800	948760	you know, CES and stuff like that.
948760	952440	And I don't think that's ever like, gone down as far as
952440	957560	Tokyo game show and Gamescom are still going on a schedule exactly, even a couple rough
957560	958560	years.
958560	962080	So so like, I don't, I don't understand how those are successful.
962080	964600	It's basically the same type of thing.
964600	969620	Somebody said very plainly, why E3 died.
969620	971280	Somebody very plainly said it.
971280	974160	We'll come back to that in a minute, because I'm gonna I'm gonna point it out and underline
974160	976360	it when we get there.
976360	980320	Because it's it's very, very much the reason why it died.
980320	982000	But we'll get there in a minute.
982000	985040	Go ahead and tell us the rest of the news, Loki.
985040	986040	Yeah.
986040	992760	So basically, you know, they, you know, said also that E3 is becoming less popular.
992760	997680	You know, while, you know, confirmed by ESA and E3 organized a repop before the report,
997680	1001040	they said many have started the question if the annual trade show was actually going to
1001040	1003160	happen or not.
1003160	1008240	You know, just was it right before this announcement went out that they were canceling show Ubisoft
1008240	1010960	confirmed that they weren't attending.
1010960	1014760	Previous to that, of course, you had Sony saying they're skipping E3, Microsoft already
1014760	1016920	confirmed that they weren't going as well.
1016920	1019240	It's like, who's left?
1019240	1021200	I mean, like, there's not much left.
1021200	1023120	Nintendo is obviously not going.
1023120	1029680	So it's just, I think once again, it's going back to the they're becoming less relevant.
1029680	1035560	And they can't sustain it either with having, you know, the public come in because, yeah,
1035560	1036600	the public can come in.
1036600	1037680	But what are you gonna show them?
1037680	1044720	There's no one here like, I don't know, it was just I don't think it's sustainable anymore.
1045520	1054760	So somebody E3 tried to partner with in those last years before the pandemic hit, Jeff Keighley
1054760	1058360	has had some interesting chess moving pieces as a result of this.
1058360	1062480	Can we can we get to some of that for the whole like, what's gonna happen now in June
1062480	1063480	type of thing?
1063480	1067560	Yeah, let me see if I can find that here real quick.
1067560	1070840	I don't remember necessarily what Jeff Keighley is doing, but Summer Game Fest.
1071520	1076560	Well, I mean, yeah, I know that but like, I didn't know what, like recent additions
1076560	1077560	to that.
1077560	1078560	Just that it's happening.
1078560	1084000	And there's, there's, he's very much been kind of hyping it up a bit tactfully around
1084000	1087960	the E3 cancellation news, which I want to come back to an earlier point, because here
1087960	1091520	it is because I left you all the cliffhanger hit it here.
1091520	1095000	But here's the person who told you why E3 was canceled, it's Jeff Keighley.
1095040	1102680	And it's it's it was a tweet that he very much kept in the drafts until this announcement
1102680	1104240	came out and then he hit send.
1104240	1106340	And here's the tweet.
1106340	1110320	Here's 15 year old me at the first ever E3 in 1995.
1110320	1114080	E3 meant so much to me and so many of you too.
1114080	1121040	Four years ago, I realized E3 wasn't evolving as it needed to compete in a global digital
1121040	1122040	world.
1122040	1124040	So we started building what's next.
1124080	1130880	E3 at Summer Game Fest, June 8th, and there it is somebody from the inside, because remember
1130880	1135880	Jeff was working with E3 to try to fix some of these problems four years ago, stating
1135880	1144120	very plainly and accurately why E3 is done, E3 wasn't evolving as it needed to compete
1144120	1147160	in a global digital world.
1147160	1148400	That's why E3 is dead.
1148400	1151080	It did not evolve in many ways.
1151080	1154400	Honestly, and honestly, I don't even know why they bothered announcing that it was going
1154400	1157280	to be coming back to begin with knowing what they know.
1157280	1158280	Safe phase.
1158280	1163480	Well, it's it's also it's it's the direction they're going looking worse.
1163480	1166240	How are they saving any face when they knew it would make them look worse?
1166240	1168240	It it's two different like purposes.
1168240	1169840	Each event had two different purposes.
1169840	1173760	Yeah, like a lot of it was game announcements and stuff, but E3 was supposed to be working
1173760	1180320	with retail and their distributor partners to, you know, have meetings about like, hey,
1180320	1181320	where are we going?
1181320	1182320	I mean, sure.
1182320	1183960	Getting the public excited about it as well.
1183960	1185840	That just goes back into sales stuff.
1185840	1190800	But when you're talking about a market that's consolidated a ton, you know, not only like
1190800	1194180	mom and pop video game shops, not a lot of them out there anymore.
1194180	1198600	The number of distributors that are out there that actually supply those places dwindling
1198600	1203200	down as we, you know, very few probably.
1203200	1204960	And then we're talking like retailers.
1204960	1207280	I mean, there's not a lot of retailers out there anymore.
1207280	1209680	Either you have, you know, your target, Wal-Mart, that type of stuff.
1209680	1210680	But like.
1210680	1216200	I mean, sure, they'll have meetings and stuff, but also, you know, for those not in the know,
1216200	1221480	outside of E3, they still have meetings like there's the whole PlayStation event that's
1221480	1226040	a destination PlayStation where they show the same type of stuff they have, like they're
1226040	1228280	almost like a mini E3 for all Sony stuff.
1228280	1230560	I'm sure Microsoft does something similar.
1230560	1233320	That's where those talks are happening now, not E3.
1233320	1239840	And so you never hear about destination PlayStation or like GameStop's internal like conferencing
1239840	1243040	that they have as well, because all that stuff's kept under lock and key.
1243040	1246360	As far as announcements and stuff go, it's all strategizing and everything.
1246360	1249720	So yeah, they're kind of irrelevant now.
1249720	1255880	So but the reason why Jeff Keighley is successful, because his intent and purpose isn't necessarily
1255880	1261960	to make deals with retailers, it's to promote the different games that these companies want
1261960	1263320	to promote and show.
1263320	1269480	So they come in, they're utilizing his platform to send the message out to a captive audience
1269480	1273120	about what's coming out to get people hyped up about that.
1273120	1280200	And then he is, of course, using that to drive this event for upcoming years.
1280200	1283440	So he can do all these fun things where they show off different stuff, because the focus
1283440	1285900	isn't on making these retail agreements.
1285900	1288360	It's about promoting these games.
1288360	1290320	It's a big commercial is basically it.
1290320	1291320	Yep.
1291360	1295280	Jeff has asked that question that the ESA needed asked quite some time ago, and that
1295280	1300600	was what is special about this event that's going to make people want to come here and
1300600	1304440	not do their own thing digitally, instead of trying to apply the template that had worked
1304440	1305440	for years and years prior.
1305440	1309960	I want to get to a couple of comments here from chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
1309960	1314640	She Hulk 10 says the game companies are cutting back, not investing in their people, customers
1314640	1319320	and so forth, stopping E3, canceling the company, picnics, breaks, PTO, safety meetings, catered
1319320	1322320	lunches, so forth, all money must be given to stockholders.
1322320	1326800	So E3 is just an expense the company's turned off accurate assessment.
1326800	1330620	Quite frankly, I would say to, to kind of take that a step further again, it goes back
1330620	1335840	to the ESA did not give a reason why you had to go to E3.
1335840	1340200	They did not create enough of a, of a must as to why to do that.
1340200	1342640	And again, we're looking at a lot of this.
1342640	1346120	I look very much at commentary on the ESA has nothing to do with read pop.
1346120	1349600	I'm sure read pop tried everything they could, but it was too far gone at that point.
1349600	1355100	They came in the picture too late, essentially the ESA has refused to evolve for the longest
1355100	1356100	time.
1356100	1359600	There are histories upon histories of examples of this going on.
1359600	1364920	This is even nitpicking on little things like remember how, how was, how was our weight
1364920	1372400	as an effective podcast gathered using Alexa rankings, which might've been a relevant internet
1372400	1375060	metric in the year 1999.
1375060	1378020	And that was something that they were continuing to use in 2010.
1378020	1381880	Now for those that think I'm being petty, how about, well, I can get real petty.
1381880	1385920	How about the fact that the ESA could not evolve their own security, which caused people's
1385920	1390780	personal information to be leaked time and time again with the show.
1390780	1395360	ESA did not evolve when they needed to evolve.
1395360	1396840	Therefore they are dead.
1396840	1403000	That is the simple, succinct short answer to this whole situation that Jeff very plainly
1403000	1407040	spelled out in that tweet, because again, Jeff is looking at this at a different angle.
1407040	1411420	And again, I'm really, I'm really not trying to suck up to this guy, but it's just one
1411420	1413400	of those things when it's right, it's right.
1413400	1414920	And he's doing a lot of things right.
1414920	1420820	As I said before on this show, before this was announced, the industry is giving Jeff
1420820	1425780	the credit that they won't give the ESA because Jeff is showing how he's bringing consumers
1425780	1429480	into this with what he's done with his video game award show and the other, you know, the
1429480	1430600	other things that he's done.
1430600	1435360	And he's going to get the industry to make announcements at summer game fest, the way
1435360	1437560	the ESA couldn't do.
1437560	1439960	And that's, that's just matter of fact.
1439960	1444420	And so Jeff is now saying, okay, what is this event I'm going to make?
1444420	1450460	And Jeff is looking at a consumer event and deciding not to go with the whole trade element
1450460	1451680	and all of that stuff.
1451680	1452980	We have GDC for that.
1452980	1457440	We have the other Tokyo game show and other places for this, and maybe something will
1457440	1460840	come along again soon, but it's not going to be E3.
1460840	1464000	And so now Jeff has this whole summer game fest thing that he's building.
1464000	1469280	And that's, that's what we're going to get now.
1469280	1474720	Although apparently the ESA did say, they said a really weird statement because they
1474720	1481080	wouldn't confirm the E3 is done, done, but they said something about, and I'm sorry if
1481080	1483800	I'm butchering the exact quote, but I don't have it in front of me, but something about
1483800	1488400	we look forward at bringing you E3 events in the future.
1488400	1494480	Like there would be branded E3 things, which is very clearly.
1494480	1498560	And I was just saying this, I'm so irritated that Bobby was on before us tonight and said
1498560	1501200	this exact, well I love Bobby, but I'm irritated.
1501200	1504920	He said this exact same thing is going to make it look like I stole it from him, but
1504920	1507960	I was ready to come in here and say, it's because they're going to, they're going to
1507960	1510240	inject E3 into PAX.
1510240	1513680	Reed Pop's going to take that E3 branding and they're going to inject it right into
1513680	1519240	PAX with the E3 show floor coming soon to Boston, coming soon to Seattle for the first
1519240	1522440	time E3, the show floor is now E3.
1522440	1526260	And quite honestly, I see it as a G4 tech TV type of situation.
1526260	1528920	Why the fuck are they PAX anymore?
1528920	1531560	I mean, not to be a bitch, but maybe a little bit.
1531560	1534440	Does anybody care about Penny Arcade, the comic anymore?
1534440	1539600	I don't think I have read the comic since we went to PAX.
1539600	1540600	Sorry.
1540600	1545200	And I'm sorry to the people out there that are going to feel I'm being absolute jerk
1545200	1549520	with that comment, but the reality by and wide is it is not part of the pop culture
1549520	1554080	internet lexicon now the way that it was, as Dark Soccer was saying in 2008 when we
1554080	1555080	went.
1555080	1556480	Who remembers Mega Tokyo?
1556480	1557480	Yeah.
1557480	1558480	Yeah.
1558480	1567280	So I think next year E3 at PAX, 2025 E3, PAX turns into E3 and that's it.
1567280	1572440	And finally, the show you all thought was E3 is E3.
1572440	1577160	We had to go the long way to get there in the 15 year plan, but we finally got there.
1577160	1580880	It's funny because I made that comment when we went to PAX that one time I said, this
1580880	1585520	feels more like E3 than E3 did.
1585520	1587760	And yeah, it kind of is.
1587760	1588760	Yeah.
1588760	1589760	And that's it.
1589760	1595840	But the thing I will give Penny Arcade Expo, and I do realize this, you have a lot of board
1595840	1604400	game fanatics, LAN fanatics, there are elements of PAX that E3 did not address, that PAX did
1604400	1609480	very well, just being a place to go play games and be a nerd, right?
1609480	1613760	There are those elements that PAX did well that E3 did not do well that I think that's
1613760	1618200	the part they're going to have to consolidate a little bit because I don't think they want
1618200	1620400	to take away those elements.
1620400	1624040	But isn't it going to be weird when there's board games at E3?
1624080	1630480	I don't know if they would do E3 at PAX because, okay, so, you know, I would assume that ESA
1630480	1633120	owns the E3 branding.
1633120	1637840	So why would you split off the revenue that you're making from PAX as read pop unless
1637840	1643680	ESA owns read pop to give money to the ESA?
1643680	1645920	I think it's the reverse.
1645920	1649360	Read pop wants the E3 name to bring in more people to PAX.
1649360	1652020	And that didn't seem to help them now.
1652020	1653560	So I don't know.
1653600	1658520	Fair point from Jason in chat, PAX isn't the Penny Arcade Expo, it's PAX.
1658520	1662160	That is a good point, you know, speaking of the, you know, the relevancy.
1662160	1664560	So what the hell is the name anymore?
1664560	1667980	It's an archaic name.
1667980	1669480	It's only tied to that con.
1669480	1674560	I think if they start calling the con E3, it's going to inject new life into it.
1674560	1678200	But who knows, who knows?
1678200	1682360	Bobby says, I remember talking to somebody who went to E3 in 2010 after attending PAX
1682400	1685960	in 08 and 09, and they were shocked E3 ended at 4 p.m.
1685960	1689120	They were like, where's the 24 hour LAN?
1689120	1690920	Exactly, exactly.
1690920	1692240	It's not a party.
1692240	1693240	Yeah.
1693240	1695440	Stop being surprised, people.
1695440	1702360	But all of that has to do with why E3, you know, and I think you saw even the trade,
1702360	1708040	I think for years they've been retreating into game developers conference a little bit.
1708280	1714160	And even the parties, by the way, for game developers conference are all work centered.
1714160	1715160	Yeah.
1715160	1721960	I mean, I went to a couple with Renee and it was a really great experience.
1721960	1727560	I liked that type of thing far better than what E3 had been even when we went.
1727560	1730440	There were some things I liked about E3, but there were a lot of things I didn't.
1730440	1732360	Yeah, meeting people was always the best part.
1732360	1733360	It really was.
1733360	1734360	So.
1734360	1735360	All right.
1736360	1738880	We're going to move on with the show because we could talk about this topic for a very
1738880	1739880	long time.
1739880	1743720	I feel like this is the third time we've eulogized E3.
1743720	1750280	I am fairly confident, and not to get an ego, but maybe a little bit, I've gotten a lot
1750280	1751960	of things right this year.
1751960	1754120	And this is one I'm going to add to the list.
1754120	1756280	This is the last time we're eulogizing E3.
1756280	1757280	It's done.
1757280	1760280	I'm done.
1761200	1766120	I honestly, I don't think that anyone is surprised.
1766120	1767800	It's not really news.
1767800	1768800	We expected it.
1768800	1769800	Yep.
1769800	1775760	I do not want to utter the words E3 ever again.
1775760	1779080	You're going to, I was going to say you're going to have to, but you don't have to do
1779080	1780080	anything.
1780080	1783120	But ReadPop is going to push that back into the conversation once they have the naming
1783120	1784640	rights over that.
1784640	1786720	But it won't be the same thing.
1786720	1790000	I won't even call it that because it's not E3.
1790000	1794800	I have to admit though, there was a morbidly curious part of me, like if they actually
1794800	1800800	did have an E3 this year, part of me kind of wanted to go in the whole, like, this is
1800800	1801800	so bad.
1801800	1805400	I have to see it for myself kind of way.
1805400	1807960	Like you wanted to go see the Ouya parking lot event.
1807960	1812460	I wanted to go, I want to see, what are the big fucking NFT ideas?
1812460	1813460	Let's see it.
1813460	1816200	Let's just see all this shit for what it is.
1816200	1818960	Let's just...
1818960	1824240	He's like, it's our year to shine now.
1824240	1828520	I still, I still, I can't.
1828520	1835920	SSJ 100 Matt in our chat says, Jason Schreier, famous Twitter personality, I believe Bloomberg
1835920	1841920	is his outlet, says, was saying that the talk at GDC was everyone asking, you going to E3?
1841920	1842920	Meh.
1842920	1843920	Are you going?
1843920	1844920	Is it happening?
1844920	1845920	Meh.
1846680	1853160	As I said, there was, we were like two months out from June at this point, two months out
1853160	1854520	from June.
1854520	1859760	And we said like the sweet spot to get flights had passed and we didn't even know if there
1859760	1861720	was going to be an E3.
1861720	1864080	It was, it was already far gone.
1864080	1865080	We knew this was coming.
1865080	1866560	It was just a matter of when.
1866560	1872880	I actually thought it would be, I did not call the timeframe of the cancellation correctly.
1872880	1875200	I apologize to the internet for getting that one wrong.
1875200	1880640	I thought it would be next week, but maybe because the leaks or whatever, they bumped
1880640	1882200	it up.
1882200	1885360	Anyway, let's move on.
1885360	1887520	Let's talk about, let's talk about facts.
1887520	1891160	The games that we've been playing in our gaming weeks, the types of video games that have
1891160	1894280	brought joy for the most part into our weeks this week.
1894280	1896480	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
1896480	1899200	My gaming week was, it was all right.
1899200	1905960	I played, I actually had a really, really good game of Beatlemania and we are trying
1905960	1908820	to work things out to where it will be ours.
1908820	1913360	So that was at my house for a lot longer.
1913360	1914360	I freaking love that table.
1914360	1916160	You know, it's just so much fun.
1916160	1917320	It's not my favorite.
1917320	1920680	That's World Cup Soccer and then Theater of Magic, but it's really fun.
1920680	1922520	I love it.
1922520	1926120	And then I've played of course, Marvel Midnight Suns.
1926120	1928380	I played on stream last night.
1928380	1934320	I have the controller that will apparently work for Star Ocean, but I was lazy and honestly
1934320	1936840	Midnight Suns fit my mood a lot better.
1936840	1941700	I wanted to finish the Morbius DLC and it was really good.
1941700	1943980	I am, I'm, they did a great job.
1943980	1949640	I just wish that some of these missions and DLCs came with more, you know.
1949640	1951060	Of course I played Dead by Daylight.
1951060	1952060	Oh yeah.
1952060	1956580	And Strelok was in last night and I got to experience the game in a completely different
1956580	1960140	way by giving descriptions of the scenery.
1960140	1966340	And I was pleased to do so, but I noticed so much more dopping and taking in the scenery
1966340	1970740	and then providing as accurate of a description of it as possible.
1970740	1974100	Really good exercise for me also in my endeavors as a writer.
1974100	1975100	Just real quick.
1975100	1976100	Sorry.
1976100	1977100	Loki, you have background noise coming through.
1977100	1978100	Just so you know.
1978100	1979100	Sorry.
1979100	1980100	Sorry.
1980100	1981100	Families in here.
1981100	1982100	No, all good.
1982100	1983100	Just mute.
1983100	1984100	Text messages.
1984620	1992140	At any rate, I did play Dead by Daylight.
1992140	1994460	I'm stuck at Eerie 3.
1994460	1999740	People are being ridiculous, but I've kind of gotten this attitude, and I must admit
1999740	2004860	I was really tired playing on Monday because it kind of affected my mood.
2004860	2010860	But overall I'm trying to adopt a more of a, you know what, it's a game.
2010860	2013260	These people, I don't know them.
2013500	2018860	I will reach out to them if I think that they were cool and say they did well.
2018860	2027180	But in the end, I'm fine with just going, not caring if I talk to the assholes or not.
2027180	2029060	I'll just report them and move on.
2029060	2033560	They're not worth it, you know?
2033560	2041660	And trying to offer some encouragement to people who are like, just crap the whole game.
2041660	2042660	They're targeting me.
2043060	2044060	No one's targeting you.
2044060	2046020	For the record, they don't know who the fuck you are.
2046020	2049420	Unless they actually follow you or something, and then they know who the fuck you are.
2049420	2053540	I also started putting TTV in my name, which I don't know how I feel about it right now,
2053540	2056900	but I made friends, so maybe it's good?
2056900	2057900	Question mark?
2057900	2066380	Anyway, I also have been playing my word game because I am addicted to it, and I started
2066380	2069860	playing Marvel Snap just out of boredom.
2069860	2070860	It's alright.
2070860	2071860	It's not great.
2072060	2078580	It's not the major, super fun thing that people have told me is it's just a fucking card game.
2078580	2086140	But it's entertaining, and yeah, it's entertaining.
2086140	2088900	And then it's not playing the game, but I listen.
2088900	2096360	I had the Hataful Boyfriend soundtrack on earlier today when I was just working on some
2096360	2098380	stuff at my desk.
2098380	2099860	It's immersing yourself in the game.
2100860	2106420	Well, the funny thing is I actually wasn't even playing it, not all the music is original.
2106420	2110860	And then I've also been prepping some stuff for my event on my birthday.
2110860	2111860	Nice.
2111860	2112860	Alright.
2112860	2113860	Yep.
2113860	2116500	I'm gonna be older.
2116500	2118980	That's how birthdays work.
2118980	2119980	Every day.
2119980	2124380	Unless you're Bobby Blackwolf, he's 29 every year somehow.
2124380	2127100	On your birthday, you are not a year older.
2127100	2128100	You're a minute older.
2130100	2134580	Yeah, it's how 40 isn't that much different from 39, to be honest.
2134580	2137040	You're older every day.
2137040	2140380	Right now, you are older than you have ever been.
2140380	2143220	You're older than you were when the show started.
2143220	2145920	Go get that Geritol, grandpas.
2145920	2146920	You're ready for it.
2146920	2151140	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2151140	2153940	It's all Minecraft.
2153940	2159500	I start off finishing up my newest episode, so I put that out on my YouTube channel.
2159660	2161260	Oh, yeah, I saw that.
2161260	2162260	Yeah.
2162260	2169900	And then also went ahead and I've been playing actually recently.
2169900	2172600	So, you know, April Fools obviously was a thing.
2172600	2177320	So Minecraft put out their April Fools update, which is the vote update.
2177320	2183180	And so like you have with the normal game, they do these events where you vote on different
2183180	2184900	features that they add to the game.
2185180	2190780	Well, now you're voting on features in the game constantly.
2190780	2196100	And so the rules are changing constantly as you vote for things and it gets weird and
2196100	2197100	wacky.
2197100	2201420	There's 380 different modifiers in the game.
2201420	2207380	Like everything from like big head mode to to things that they should have added in the
2207380	2208380	game.
2208380	2211500	And they said they couldn't add in the game, but then they did add in the game in this
2211500	2212500	update.
2212500	2216620	And now they're probably not going to put in the proper game, which is like why you've
2216620	2217900	developed it.
2217900	2218900	You can do it.
2218900	2222020	You're just now being stubborn and not doing it.
2222020	2223020	So there's that.
2223020	2229240	So I spun up a server last night for the updates and I'm trying to get some people to play
2229240	2235500	with me to do like a one month long kind of like miniseries thing where we all the chaos
2235500	2236500	in there.
2236500	2238300	And it's pretty crazy right now.
2238300	2241660	So I'm looking forward to that.
2241660	2244740	And then working on my new modded episode.
2244740	2247740	So that's coming as well.
2247740	2250940	And still no word from Mo Yang about the contest.
2250940	2256540	They are everybody keeps asking him about it and is taking them an unreasonable long
2256540	2259860	amount of time to announce someone to evaluate.
2259860	2265380	They have they have started and ended new contests in the time that they still haven't
2265380	2267240	put out the results for that.
2267240	2271420	So your guess is as good as mine at this point.
2271420	2273260	We'll just have to wait and see.
2273260	2275140	But right now, I have no idea.
2275140	2279300	Oh, but I did want to mention a completely separate topic from games when saw Dungeons
2279300	2280300	and Dragons today.
2280300	2281300	It's fantastic.
2281300	2282300	Go see it.
2282300	2283300	Is it?
2283300	2284300	I've heard good things.
2284300	2285300	Yeah.
2285300	2286300	The scene.
2286300	2287300	Which scene?
2287300	2290100	The the the Easter egg.
2290100	2291100	Yes.
2291100	2292100	I saw the Easter egg.
2292100	2299180	It is a prominent a prominent part of the movie in at least it's in several parts.
2299180	2300660	But yeah, there's lots of Easter eggs.
2301060	2304980	I'm not really familiar with the Dungeons and Dragons lore, but obviously there's a
2304980	2309180	lot of like name drops for different things like they know in the view game space like
2309180	2312460	Baldur's Gate.
2312460	2317340	Was it a universe is it set in or is it like multi universe?
2317340	2318660	I don't know.
2318660	2319660	It.
2319660	2320660	Yeah.
2320660	2325260	It's something to do with the Red Wizards, but I guess that's all canon and stuff.
2325260	2326420	But yeah, it's really cool.
2326420	2327420	Really.
2327420	2329220	And there's a lot of funny moments in there.
2329220	2332140	It sounds it is a great movie.
2332140	2333740	I highly recommend you go see it.
2333740	2336980	You know, and I was reminded I totally forgot that this was this week.
2336980	2338740	The Mario movies out this week.
2338740	2339740	There's a lot of people.
2339740	2340740	I'm also seeing that this week.
2340740	2341740	Yeah.
2341740	2342740	We're going to be seeing that opening day.
2342740	2343740	So very excited.
2343740	2344740	I'm not.
2344740	2347500	I have two other movies that I want to see and then I'll decide if I want to see the
2347500	2349620	Mario movie when nobody else is seeing it.
2349620	2352180	Yeah, I don't have to deal with other humans.
2352180	2355300	Yeah, I don't want to deal with kids in the theater, but I might go to a late showing.
2355300	2357420	I just had to find a date.
2357420	2359140	Maybe Alan will take me, but I don't know.
2359140	2364100	This is the person who went to see the Pokemon movie with me back in the day.
2364100	2366700	That was a long time ago, but yes.
2366700	2369900	You want to know what movie I saw in the theater when it came out?
2369900	2371780	The Power Rangers movie.
2371780	2372780	Oh, yeah.
2372780	2375580	I got dragged to that too by you know who to the Power Rangers.
2375580	2377660	But I say drag, but it actually was a decent movie.
2377660	2382260	I thought when I was in Alabama, I was in college and I went with my friend Marcy to
2382260	2383260	see it.
2383260	2385380	I'm talking about the original.
2385380	2388260	I was talking about the Elizabeth Banks one.
2388260	2389260	Okay.
2389260	2390260	Yeah.
2390260	2391980	I mean, the real thing.
2391980	2392980	Got it.
2392980	2393980	All right.
2393980	2398700	Um, let's start with the skydiving and all that.
2398700	2399700	Yeah.
2399700	2401020	Let's talk about my gaming week.
2401020	2403580	So my gaming week, I have continued to play theater them.
2403580	2406460	I streamed a little bit of that earlier in the week because there was some new DLC for
2406460	2407860	Nier that came out this week.
2407860	2411820	So played through that been still I'm still working on trying to play every song once
2411820	2412940	I'm still not there.
2412940	2415340	I'm really close, but not there yet.
2415340	2418260	Actually I say really close, like 70 songs to go, but I'm going to play some more off
2418260	2422340	stream probably tonight and maybe the next time I stream that game, when the next DLC
2422340	2427020	comes out next week, I'll be, I'll be ready to finally get that trophy for playing every
2427020	2428260	song at least once.
2428260	2431580	And just knowing that I've played every song at least once been experimenting with some
2431580	2434700	different builds, like to item farm and do things like that.
2434700	2437140	So that's been, that's been fun.
2437140	2442860	Otherwise most of my gaming week, large chunk of it has been playing a little bit of an
2442860	2443860	oldie at this point.
2443860	2447220	It's a little bit of backlog catch up, but not that old, it's maybe about a year old.
2447220	2448620	Pokemon Legends Arceus.
2448620	2452820	I've been streaming hours and hours of that and been playing a little bit off stream as
2452820	2453820	well.
2453820	2457740	I've now surpassed the point I was at the first time, but I'm having a lot of fun with
2457740	2458740	it.
2458740	2463900	Just, you know, the whole stealthy, my, my mindset approach to it is very different as
2463900	2466220	opposed to feeling the need to complete the Pokedex.
2466220	2471180	Like as I go, I'm just kind of catching everything, crafting everything and just kind of taking
2471180	2474820	it as I want to do things and kind of taking that attitude with it.
2474820	2477020	And I feel like I'm making a lot better progress.
2477020	2482100	I'm actually, and apparently I just got to the third area, the coast lands.
2482100	2485260	The minimum you need to get to that area is three stars.
2485260	2487580	I was reading, I have four stars.
2487580	2493140	So even the approach I'm taking is still allowing me to be ahead of the curve, so to speak on
2493140	2494140	the game.
2494140	2495140	But I'm, I'm having fun.
2495140	2498660	I it's, it's a different approach to Pokemon, you know, doing like the stealth catching
2498660	2501500	and all that stuff, but I'm having a good time.
2501500	2504580	I got a shiny in the game randomly this week.
2504580	2510220	There's actually a clip from my channel, a yellow Shinx showed up randomly out of the
2510220	2511220	blue.
2511220	2514260	So I actually had a little bit of shiny luck.
2514260	2519180	Everybody who plays gets a shiny Ponyta because it's in one of the quests, but I actually
2519180	2520300	got a shiny Shinx as well.
2520300	2523680	So that was pretty exciting, even if I've seen those before, but that's all right.
2523680	2525680	I like Shinx because it's very different.
2525680	2528360	It's not just like it's blue, but darker.
2528360	2531660	It's a very obviously different color and I think that's fun.
2531660	2534680	So yeah, I'm loving Pokemon Legends Arceus.
2534680	2539840	Other than those two games, I've also been playing still a lot of Diablo three, whether
2539840	2542460	it's just, I've been playing the latest season.
2542460	2544780	I just got my gold portrait frame tonight.
2544780	2549340	It took me a little time cause I had to farm another six piece set for those that play
2549340	2550340	the game.
2550340	2554840	You know, you have to get these various landmarks and the, I'm playing a witch doctor this season
2554840	2559780	and the free set that they give you is the new set they put in the game later on.
2559780	2561980	So there is no set dungeon for it.
2561980	2566780	So you can't clear the set dungeon achievement unless you farm a new set.
2566780	2570660	It sounds really tedious and boring, but that's exactly what Diablo is supposed to be.
2570660	2573700	Click party, do the loop again.
2573700	2575860	You didn't get the loop you wanted again.
2575860	2578740	You didn't get the loop you wanted again.
2578740	2580740	That's Diablo.
2580740	2585040	But I watch, I lurk in people's Twitch channels, like I'll watch Dark Soccer, play Midnight
2585040	2588780	Suns for a little bit and then do it, do a rift and then like, okay, if somebody else
2588780	2593340	on Twitch, I want to watch for a little bit, I'll channel surf and do a rift here and lurk
2593340	2594340	and do that.
2594340	2597120	That's, that's my Diablo playing in a nutshell.
2597120	2599320	So that was my gaming week.
2599320	2602160	I imagine I'll still be playing a lot of Legends Arceus this week.
2602160	2603240	I do want to beat it.
2603240	2608760	So I'm going to try to do most of my play on stream, but I've been doing some things
2608760	2613760	off stream, like side quests and like grinding arts and crafts and things like that.
2613760	2617020	Things that I, I, you know, don't necessarily need to stream.
2617020	2620140	So all right, let's move on.
2620140	2622920	We have some more news to get into for this week.
2622920	2629040	And then we'll take your calls later on in the show over on our discord server, vognetwork.com.
2629040	2631960	That's vognetwork.com slash discord.
2631960	2636840	For now, let's get to our first big story tonight from Loki.
2636840	2638480	Yeah.
2638480	2647120	So you know, Congress is really trying to get to the bottom of important topics right
2647120	2648680	now.
2648680	2649680	Not gun violence.
2649680	2651240	Now's not the time for that.
2651240	2655440	But now we're going to talk about how Japan is being unfair.
2655440	2662640	And it's just not fair that Japan and Sony you know, have like such a large market share
2662640	2664400	of the Japanese audience.
2664400	2666420	And it's just not fair to Microsoft.
2666460	2674420	So they have interjected themselves into this whole acquisition of Activision from Microsoft
2674420	2683980	by I think, sending a letter to Sony and I guess, I'm sorry to the US trade or they said
2683980	2691000	this letter to Sony in regards to the attention of the imbalanced in the video game market
2691000	2695860	and says which we are concerned may be a result of discriminatory trade practices that could
2695860	2702780	violate the spirit of the US Japan digital trade agreement that Sony has a 90% console
2702780	2708460	market share in Japan, and that makes exclusive arrangements to keep popular games from the
2708460	2709920	Xbox.
2709920	2716380	So kind of like a reverse Activision, I guess if you will.
2716380	2719700	I wish they would just focus themselves on more important things.
2719700	2724260	I mean, considering that they have literally no idea on how the internet works right now,
2724260	2726980	Grandpa, I'm sorry, just doesn't understand.
2726980	2731420	And I really wish that they would turn their sights to something more important than Microsoft
2731420	2734420	not being as popular as Sony in Japan.
2734420	2737940	I mean, it's not even the United States, like, who cares?
2737940	2738940	I don't know.
2738940	2743100	But they even start about how much revenue that or how much money the Japanese government
2743100	2748260	puts into Sony as a major, you know, part of the economy.
2748260	2753740	Well, I think the whole ordeal just goes to show that the US is not going to stop that
2753740	2758460	Microsoft Activision merger, basically, a Congress person who I believe gets a lot of
2758460	2763580	donations from Microsoft for the record, has basically gone on record saying, you know,
2763580	2770380	I feel as an indirect response to what's going on in the UK, basically saying, why is Sony
2770380	2773540	arguing all this shit when they've got all this going on in Japan?
2773540	2774800	That's how it read to me.
2774800	2778420	I don't think a Congress person needed to involve themselves in that.
2778420	2780780	That's the part that strikes me as kind of odd.
2780780	2784300	And it definitely just shows that, you know what, US ain't going to put up a fight on
2784300	2785300	this merger.
2785300	2789260	So the fact that it's cleared the UK, I would say at this point was the biggest hurdle.
2789260	2795120	I realize Congress is not the body that does this, but it's still showing a temperature
2795120	2798980	check of what Washington DC is thinking.
2798980	2804120	I don't see how this doesn't pass muster at this point in the US and this merger goes
2804120	2808620	through because if it doesn't, then Congress is going to be like WTF.
2808620	2814580	I mean, they're busy right now trying to ban TikTok anyways, so it's like, I don't
2814580	2817220	get me started on that either.
2817220	2819780	No, it's the whole thing is stupid.
2819780	2823420	Once again, you hear the line of questioning and like anything that when we talk about
2823420	2828220	like Facebook and the security leads with that and everything, and this, their lack
2828220	2832700	of understanding of how social media works and how the internet works or anything works,
2832700	2833700	really.
2833700	2838980	It's just like these people are making decisions based off of being stupid and then someone
2838980	2843620	tells them, well, this is how it works without knowing anything or just listening to them
2843620	2844620	blindly.
2844620	2849540	And it's like, okay, then they make sweeping decisions based on like these false narratives
2849540	2854180	and stuff that because they're just not informed because they're super old.
2854180	2855180	They're old.
2855180	2858820	The computer, the internet didn't exist when they were like our age.
2858820	2861140	They are super old and they need to leave.
2861140	2864580	But unfortunately they have to make decisions now about that stuff.
2864580	2865580	Oh God.
2865580	2871540	And when AI comes around, well, straight up on Star Trek, is this like, you know, like,
2871540	2872540	I don't know.
2872540	2873540	I can't think.
2873540	2874540	Is this like Tron?
2874540	2875540	Is this Tron?
2875540	2876540	Are we running into a Tron situation?
2876540	2877540	No, no, no.
2877540	2879420	For the generation in Congress.
2879420	2881620	Is this like 2001 A Space Odyssey?
2881620	2883940	That's 2001 A Space Odyssey, yeah.
2883940	2887340	Like here's, it's, yeah, it's awful.
2887340	2889660	Here's, here's, here's the thing.
2889660	2893900	I trust TikTok with my data more than I do Twitter at this point.
2893900	2895560	Now here, here I go.
2895560	2896700	Here come my soapbox.
2896700	2897700	Here it is.
2897700	2903100	But I'm just going to say the person in charge of Twitter that has no right to be there,
2903100	2910460	but had the bank account big enough to do it has shown a willingness to post in private
2910460	2919300	employee conversations to advance whatever his stupid agenda is over on that site.
2919300	2923080	At least I don't see the CEO of TikTok doing that.
2923080	2928540	So I, the whole thing is, the argument is invalid as far as I'm concerned when Twitter
2928540	2932340	is not being dragged through the mud, just to the same extent that TikTok is.
2932340	2936540	Well, that was the point, like when they met in Cong-, or had like the thing in Congress,
2936540	2942460	like that was the first point they brought up was like, you first off, like, you know,
2942460	2945180	they're saying the Chinese government doesn't have access to this stuff anyways.
2945180	2948540	They were like, but that aside, like, what about Facebook?
2948540	2949900	What about like Twitter?
2949900	2953540	Like what about all these companies that have the same issues and like Facebook has been
2953540	2956580	caught several times selling that information?
2956580	2959660	Like it's not just like, we assume that this is happening.
2959660	2961540	It's like, it's demonstrably happening.
2961540	2968320	I mean, they've been caught numerous times, like, like, why, why are you holding TikTok
2968320	2970180	to a different regard than everything else?
2970180	2974420	It's because you think it's a Chinese spy app, which I mean, yeah, they may have access
2974420	2975420	to it.
2975420	2978020	But like, what are they really going to do with like, oh, yeah.
2978020	2980860	It's information they could get other ways.
2980860	2981900	Like, yeah, I don't know.
2981900	2982900	It's just so stupid.
2982900	2985300	But like, I don't understand what the point is.
2985300	2989980	Uh, DJ Rama S in chat says, from an IT point of view, TikTok should not be on government
2989980	2991060	and corporate phones.
2991060	2992060	And that's it.
2992060	2993060	I agree.
2993060	2994280	I actually agree with that.
2994280	2996020	And Facebook shouldn't be there either.
2996020	2998220	And neither should Twitter.
2998220	3001500	None of them should be on government or corporate phones.
3001500	3002500	That I will agree with.
3002500	3003500	Yeah.
3003500	3004500	Yeah.
3004500	3009300	I mean, but there's way too many companies out there, including the one where I work,
3009300	3017500	where they provide, I guess, links to corporate services through your personal phone.
3017500	3020620	And they can't tell people what to put on their personal phone.
3020620	3021620	Yeah.
3021620	3027960	So that's kind of a fine line if, if they don't want this to be on a phone that somebody
3027960	3031420	who is working in this facility is using, they need to give them their own business
3031420	3032420	phone.
3032420	3033420	Period.
3034340	3035900	That has data, right.
3035900	3042280	That has, uh, uh, management, uh, a management profile on it that would prevent from installing
3042280	3048220	social media applications, but companies aren't going to give everybody their own phone.
3048220	3050700	The government's not going to give everybody their own phone.
3050700	3051700	That's yeah.
3051700	3052700	Yeah.
3052700	3056380	And that's what they, they have like, at least I know for our company, they have something
3056380	3062760	similar, like if you're using your phone for work, um, which I like, I used to check stuff
3062800	3066560	through work, but like now that they've locked it down, like, no, I'm not going to go through
3066560	3070320	the whole process, but it's basically, you would have to set up a separate login, which
3070320	3072680	basically then locks everything down.
3072680	3077920	So it's like, there's a separation between your work data and your, you know, public
3077920	3080520	data, I guess there's like a wall there.
3080520	3084520	And when you're in your work data and all that stuff, then it's locking all of that
3084520	3085520	stuff down.
3085520	3087920	They're monitoring what you're doing, that type of stuff like that.
3087920	3092200	But it, you'd have to be in on that secure login in order to do that.
3092200	3093840	And I'm just like, that's too much trouble.
3093840	3096300	Plus I don't want people contacting me when I'm not working.
3096300	3097840	So I'm not doing that.
3097840	3098840	Yeah.
3098840	3100840	I don't use my work phone for anything but texts and emails.
3100840	3105720	The, I would say the most personal thing I've ever used my work for work phone for the occasional,
3105720	3109720	and I mean, occasional Apple news headline that pops up on my phone, cause it's an iPhone
3109720	3111320	that grabs my attention.
3111320	3112320	That's it.
3112320	3113320	No.
3113320	3117320	Um, I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll be perfectly honest.
3117320	3124880	Um, I don't let any, I will not put anything work-related on anything personal that I don't
3124880	3125880	blame you.
3125880	3126880	I don't blame you.
3126880	3133680	I must have that defining line or else like people who do do this stuff all the time.
3133680	3136160	No, that's unhealthy.
3136160	3138520	When you're at home, be at home.
3138520	3139520	Shit.
3139520	3140520	Um, real quick.
3140520	3141520	Uh, one more comment on this.
3141520	3142520	I want to get to the next story.
3142520	3146160	DJ Romas says the difference is that TikTok is originally a Chinese company and that's
3146160	3147160	the issue they're having.
3147200	3148200	Oh, absolutely.
3148200	3149200	But guess what?
3149200	3152440	And this is true of every, any Congress person as well.
3152440	3154600	All the phones in your pocket were made in China.
3154600	3155600	All of them.
3155600	3156600	It doesn't matter what brand.
3156600	3157960	I don't care if you're an iPhone.
3157960	3161260	They have some component at least that was made in China.
3161260	3164960	The device you're using to listen to this podcast, watch this show had a, it's part
3164960	3167720	of it was made in China, some part of it.
3167720	3173180	So this whole TikTok thing just screams out of touch, but anyway, but as far as government
3173180	3174180	phones go, fine.
3174180	3175180	Yes.
3175180	3176180	All social media should be banned on government phones.
3176180	3177180	Yes.
3177180	3178180	I would agree with that.
3178180	3183020	Anyway, moving on, let's talk about other unpopular changes that have nothing to do
3183020	3187100	with the government, but I, some people are wondering if this one ends up with the government
3187100	3189860	and let me tell you, that would be, I don't think it does.
3189860	3191220	That would be the day though.
3191220	3192900	Um, Pokemon go.
3192900	3193900	Yes.
3193900	3194900	It's still going.
3194900	3200020	Um, I know in 2016 that was, that was the year, the year before the simulation started
3200020	3203600	the summer of 2016 boy, those were the days.
3203600	3206440	Those days are long gone, but Pokemon go has still been going.
3206440	3212640	In fact, Pokemon go made several changes to the game in response to COVID lockdowns.
3212640	3216880	And now Niantic wants to undo some of those changes.
3216880	3218700	It's not popular with the community.
3218700	3220000	Go figure.
3220000	3226760	So this week that they announced that a remote raid passes and remote raids would be changing.
3226760	3231360	The price of the remote raid pass three pack would be increasing from 300.
3231360	3239840	That's about $3 to 525 pokey coins, about 500 or $525, $5 and 25 cents.
3239840	3248080	The price of a single remote raid pass will jump from 100 to 195, almost $2.
3248080	3253740	Trainers will be able to participate in a maximum of five remote raids per day.
3253740	3257080	And this maximum may change and increase for special events.
3257080	3260660	They are saying though, remote raid passes will be included in the pool of potential
3260660	3262620	rewards for research breakthroughs.
3262620	3263620	That's kind of nice.
3263620	3264620	Cause I don't buy those things anymore.
3264620	3267220	I'm going to come back to that in a minute.
3267220	3270760	But they are still subject to the limit of, you can only have three of them in inventory
3270760	3271760	at a time.
3271760	3277420	Anyway, long story short, people are pissed about this news.
3277420	3284580	So far as you know, I don't want to play the game outside due to a limitation I may have
3284580	3285580	or whatever it is.
3285580	3287860	I got used to these changes.
3287860	3290500	I'm pissed off about these changes.
3290500	3300680	From where I'm sitting, Niantic made a classic, classic blunder that blows my mind that they
3300680	3306740	are aloof enough to still do, because they've gone through this before.
3306740	3311580	Remember when they changed the range of a pokey stop from 80 meters back down to 40
3311580	3312580	meters?
3312580	3314620	And they ended up having to reverse course on that by the way, because the community
3314620	3317660	got pissed.
3317660	3323340	The same thing then that's happening now, you announced the bad news without announcing
3323340	3325540	any good news to go with it.
3325540	3332200	And I'm sorry, maybe you'll get a remote raid pass and your research pack is not good news.
3332200	3336540	And they linked in that announcement article to an article that talks about, we have exciting
3336540	3340620	changes coming for the game and we're going to have all these events that will get excited
3340620	3343180	to get people back in person.
3343180	3351660	What a bunch of fucking bullshit fluff, hot air up my butthole statement was that?
3351660	3353660	Literally nothing tangible.
3353660	3354660	Nothing.
3354660	3357820	Tell us how you really feel.
3357820	3358820	How I really feel?
3358820	3365620	I have never seen in my life, I have been covering video games for 21 years.
3365620	3373860	I have never seen such a load of hot air up our fucking asshole than Niantic putting
3373860	3380380	out that statement of, here's the good stuff that's going to offset the bad stuff.
3380380	3382340	What the fuck was that?
3382340	3384420	Do you not have a PR department?
3384420	3389820	I know Twitter doesn't have a PR department, but last I checked Niantic is not auto responding
3389820	3391580	to things with the poop emoji.
3391580	3396340	There are people actually thinking at Niantic, but when they put this release out, I don't
3396340	3398300	think anybody was thinking.
3398300	3400220	Did they have the week off?
3400220	3404780	What the fuck were you thinking?
3404780	3409980	I'm assuming emergency meetings were happening this weekend after the large way that this
3409980	3415940	went over in the community, like diarrhea at a library where the ventilation is broken.
3415940	3420060	That's about how well this news went over when they announced this, because there was
3420060	3423420	no good news to offset the bad news.
3423420	3432860	I just don't know why they need consultants to consult people who actually have a pulse.
3432860	3435260	There is a sick part of me that loves Niantic.
3435260	3436980	I still do.
3436980	3442660	And again, not to use the example I've been using for 20 years, but here I go, Tyra Banks,
3442660	3443660	we were rooting for you.
3443660	3445080	We were all rooting for you.
3445080	3449120	There is very much that coming into play with what I'm saying about Niantic right now, because
3449120	3453680	I've loved Niantic from before Pokemon Go, because I'm an old school Ingress player.
3453680	3456560	Yes, I'm one of those irritating people in the Pokemon Go community.
3456560	3461880	I was playing Ingress, Pokemon Go, hell, I really try to give all of the AR games a break,
3461880	3463480	but I'm going to be real honest.
3463480	3468040	Niantic, this decision and a lot of other things going on at Niantic feel really drunk
3468040	3478640	with power, and this is not a good look, because let me tell you, NBA All World sucks.
3478640	3482360	NBA All World sucks.
3482360	3487640	I don't know who the fuck thought it would be a very enticing game to go out into the
3487640	3493480	world to play a shoddy 1v1 game when standing at a basketball court.
3493480	3498460	I don't know who the fuck thought that was a good idea, but they were very wrong.
3498460	3506580	And if that's what the future of Niantic games looks like, they're in some deep fucking trouble.
3506580	3512460	And Niantic is going to get bought by another company if they continue to make stupid decisions
3512460	3517300	like this one.
3517300	3525900	Learn something from this, because I honestly feel like Niantic never does.
3525900	3530880	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I honestly think Niantic was okay with rural and disabled people
3530880	3534800	not playing their game, as the people who are walking around and playing the game as
3534800	3538760	originally intended are the ones that give a data set of value.
3538760	3551120	I believe Niantic believes that if a disabled person can't play the game, that is not a
3551120	3555760	fault of Niantic, but a fault of the world for not being accessible.
3555760	3561040	I will say this, and I am willing to go on record saying this.
3561040	3570040	I would be very curious how many non differently-abled people out there are latching on to the disabled
3570040	3573120	conversation just to dunk on Niantic.
3573120	3578560	Because again, from my Ingress experience, one of the most hardcore players in this area
3578560	3583040	that is very good at Ingress where you have to go to different locations and throws very
3583040	3588840	good field, she uses a scooter 95% of the time.
3588840	3591200	That doesn't stop her from being a beast in Ingress.
3591200	3595680	Rob, I still don't think that that's going to be a very good example.
3595680	3599360	There are people who cannot afford a mobility scooter.
3599360	3605120	There are people who are on- I did not say I'm not aware of any of that.
3605120	3610480	I'm just saying, I think there's a lot of people who are latching on to this argument
3610480	3614160	for the wrong reasons.
3614160	3619760	I think it's about, I don't want to pay $2 as opposed to $1.
3619760	3627280	Anyway, let's see, VXJ6V in chat says, getting bought by another company isn't a punishment.
3627280	3631340	Not to some, but I just see that's the road Niantic's headed down.
3631340	3633840	Because NBA All-World, as far as I'm concerned, is a flop.
3633840	3635600	I'm not hearing about anybody playing it.
3635600	3637380	It's not in the press.
3637380	3638680	It's an absolute flop.
3638680	3643120	It should be everywhere when we're in the NBA finals right now and all that.
3643120	3647000	ParaDot comes out in a couple of months and I don't think anyone's going to care.
3647000	3648000	What?
3648000	3649000	Exactly.
3649000	3650000	What was it?
3650000	3657280	ParaDot, their original monster type of game is coming out.
3657280	3663080	I think Niantic at this point is also leaning in a lot to selling their tech to other companies.
3663080	3664680	That part is smart.
3664680	3669600	That part is smart and it will probably be ultimately what keeps Niantic afloat because
3669600	3673640	a lot of these game decisions are just not great for the company.
3673640	3684120	Anyway, let's see, SD100Matt says, Edwove Niantic said, I'm paraphrasing to some degree,
3684120	3688340	it's not about the taking the shortcut to reach the goal, it's about the journey to
3688340	3689660	reach that goal.
3689660	3694420	So it's about many of us rural players driving 30 minutes to go to raids to only maybe get
3694420	3696760	two to three people and not win.
3696960	3702280	If Niantic was going to do this, then that should have been coupled with, here is what
3702280	3706920	we're adding to the game so that when you go to a raid, you have the people to do it
3706920	3710960	or you can find the people to do the raid, which I guess they're leaning into campfire
3710960	3715040	to some of that, but campfire isn't even available worldwide still.
3715040	3719400	So there's a lot of that that just, it doesn't work.
3719400	3725600	So anyway, SD100Matt says, Niantic isn't getting any of my money anymore, not for their stale
3725600	3731040	community days, Go Fest and other stale events because they do not focus on innovating.
3731040	3734160	And Niantic has the ability to generate events.
3734160	3740000	If they wanted to generate events, they have a map on their website, community.day, that
3740000	3746160	shows all of the hotbeds around the world, all of the parks, and I would bet they could
3746160	3752040	run a script to see, do they have a location within 50 miles of anyone?
3752040	3754760	And there might be some places they would need to get additional coverage, but I would
3754760	3759560	bet the majority of America probably has one of these places within 50 miles of them.
3759560	3762840	If not, that's something Niantic can work on by looking at the hotbeds where people
3762840	3763880	are playing.
3763880	3768620	Why do they have to run a Pokemon day only in Vegas?
3768620	3771600	Why can't they run an event worldwide?
3771600	3777040	And if they want people to gather at a certain spot, an accessible place that anybody can
3777040	3784520	get around at, like the Capitol Park is one of the ones here, then you could do the event
3784520	3785520	there.
3785520	3792120	And that would encourage, give people incentive and a more reason to gather in person.
3792120	3795880	Don't take away a reason to play the game the way people have been playing.
3795880	3799460	That's what it boils down to at the end of the day.
3799460	3803040	And I think it's an ill-advised decision, obviously.
3803040	3805040	So anyway.
3805040	3810400	I'm still justifying deleting it off of my phone two years ago, so.
3810400	3814600	Oh yeah, and there's a lot of people that are doing it now.
3814600	3820700	But to those people, specifically the ones deleting it over this, I'm going to ask a
3820700	3823360	very tough question.
3823360	3832120	When Niantic releases Arceus or a new shiny or that new must-have Pokemon, when they release
3832120	3835940	that, are you going to be willing to keep that game off your phone?
3835940	3840080	Because that's the only way the message is going to be received.
3840080	3842920	So I hope you all stick to it.
3842920	3847200	Just forget it exists, and then it's great.
3847200	3851240	Every time someone brings up Niantic or Pokemon, like, oh yeah, that's still a thing, and then
3851240	3853460	I promptly forget about it again.
3853460	3856120	And I'm going to say this to the other side.
3856120	3858120	I do have good things to say about Niantic.
3858120	3861500	I wouldn't have some of the closest friends I have if it wasn't for Ingress.
3861500	3865740	I've met people through Ingress that I legitimately hang out with outside of the context of the
3865740	3868620	game because I just like them as people.
3868620	3871060	There's been a lot of good stuff there, and I understand.
3871060	3874540	I understand why Niantic wants to replicate that experience.
3874540	3876180	They're just going about it the wrong way.
3876180	3877180	That's what it is.
3877180	3880660	And as far as Pikmin goes, I credit Pikmin.
3880660	3881980	I do, in large part.
3881980	3886260	I credit myself, and I credit a lot of things that I did, but I credit Pikmin in large part
3886260	3893140	for being the incentive for why I lost 50 pounds when I needed to last year.
3893140	3895380	Pikmin was a huge incentive in that.
3895380	3901300	Honestly, I give the credit 100% to you and just that you found tools to make it happen.
3901300	3904340	Well thank you, yes, but I will say Pikmin was a tool for me.
3904340	3911180	It was a game to play, a goal line to keep going for that I kept being motivated to leave
3911180	3913500	the house and go for when, you know.
3913500	3914580	These are my motivations.
3914580	3920540	My Apple Watch and my Bullet Journal, because I like fitting in those goals that say that
3920540	3922460	I did what I set out to do.
3922460	3925380	The fitness watches are really good for that type of stuff, too.
3925380	3926380	They are.
3926380	3928180	But anyway, all right.
3928180	3931860	We could probably spend a three-hour show just talking about those changes, but we're
3931860	3933820	going to move on to some other headlines.
3933820	3936620	Let's move on to this next headline, Dark Sakura.
3936620	3943900	All right, well speaking of, you know, we're actually going to not even speak of Pokemon
3944180	3948420	anymore for a minute and go on to another fun little game called Vampire Survivors.
3949140	3950260	We love this game, right?
3951140	3952340	Yeah, I love Vampire Survivors.
3953060	3961700	But anyway, it actually beat out God of War Ragnarok for Best Game Award at the BAFTA
3961700	3962180	Awards.
3964100	3969300	And while God of War Ragnarok was the most nominated game, this one took the game of
3969300	3969620	the year.
3969620	3970740	I think it's awesome.
3970740	3976420	And it won not just Best Game, but Best Design as well.
3977620	3980660	Elden Ring and Tunic were also multi-award winners.
3980660	3987780	But I mean, the fact that this beat out, you know, Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok and
3987780	3992660	all of these others, it's pretty amazing, I think.
3992660	3996420	Only the greatest minds know to put Vampire Survivors as their game of the year.
3998020	3999140	I saw them play that game.
3999140	4000100	I really need to.
4000100	4000580	You do.
4000580	4001140	You really do.
4001700	4007380	Yoshida Shuhei was also given a BAFTA fellowship.
4008020	4008820	Sorry, fellowship.
4008820	4011140	That's the Corsoni executive.
4011140	4017540	And it's the highest, you know, award or accolade that can be given by the Academy.
4017540	4022740	And others who have received it are Alfred Hitchcock, Charlie Chaplin, David Attenborough,
4022740	4025860	Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, and Martin Scorsese.
4025860	4031780	You know, other people who received it have been Miyamoto, who was actually the first
4031780	4040740	Asian citizen to get the award, Kojima, Molyneux, Bushnell, Newell, Carmack, lots of big names,
4040740	4041460	lots of people.
4042100	4048100	But the top British game to win the award this year was Rollerdrome, which I haven't
4048100	4057620	played, you know, lots of really good just voice acting credits, you know, different
4057620	4058180	people.
4058180	4065700	I think that it's fantastic who has been, what games and who has been honored in this
4065700	4066020	one.
4066020	4068020	So I'm quite pleased.
4068020	4069620	You know what the best evolving game has been?
4070900	4071940	Final Fantasy XIV.
4073140	4076180	I would figure that or No Man's Sky, honestly.
4078660	4079300	There we go.
4079300	4079800	Nice.
4080180	4083460	Well, thank you for the update from the Baftas and what's happening overseas.
4084980	4085700	Let's move on.
4085700	4086200	Loki.
4087220	4087780	All right.
4087780	4094500	So we've got word that the PlayStation VR2 headsets aren't selling as many units as they
4094500	4095700	probably would have liked.
4095700	4100420	So right now it's projected that they've sold less than 300,000 units in the first month
4100420	4103860	saying, and because of that, critics are saying that maybe they should have dropped the price
4103860	4105700	or added backwards compatibility.
4105700	4110900	I think it's also too hard to tell right now because overall, I think AR and VR headsets
4110900	4111540	are down.
4111540	4117460	It looks like about 40% over a six month period, which was ending in 2023.
4119300	4121940	So I don't know, give it time.
4121940	4123940	But yes, I do think it's expensive.
4123940	4126180	Also launch games, not a lot.
4126820	4131460	You know, their system seller that they wanted to like kind of put out there for Horizon.
4132100	4135860	Um, not as good as they would have liked it to have been.
4136580	4139620	Resident Evil 4 probably will help when that comes out.
4139620	4142740	You know, I think that's actually already out now, but that'll help.
4142740	4148580	But I think they need something that is a system seller because honestly, like for me,
4148580	4154900	like if I wanted to get into something like that to play just that wonderful on rails
4154900	4160020	coaster shooter game, I am not dropping over $1,000 to do that.
4160020	4162180	So it doesn't make any sense.
4162180	4165460	It's just such a barrier to entry to get into that.
4165460	4169940	So I think the cost needs to come down significantly to get new adopters in.
4169940	4172980	And then on top of that, you know, backwards compatibility, which is just not going to
4172980	4178740	happen, would at least incentivize people to purchase it that may have a PlayStation
4178740	4182900	VR one to, you know, bring over their library.
4182900	4186580	But since they can't do that, well, so I guess you just have to play on PC.
4187540	4191300	Grant and we've gone over this before that the changes in tech are what's making that
4191300	4191860	difficult.
4191860	4198340	I'll give Sony a certain amount of credit for that is that, you know, the tech changes
4198340	4203620	are what's and that's why games like No Man's Sky are re-releasing on VR too, because
4203620	4206900	they have to basically, you know, be updated for the new tech.
4206900	4208180	That part I get.
4208180	4212500	But it's exactly what you said when it comes to the launch titles just aren't there,
4212500	4214820	especially for a one thousand dollar entry.
4214820	4221300	If you don't have a PlayStation five already, there's not one game is not enough or it's
4221300	4222740	got to be a hell of a game.
4222740	4224420	You know, it's got to be like amazing.
4224420	4227700	It's got to be Wii Sports level moving systems.
4227700	4229060	It's got to be that level.
4229060	4230820	Like they don't have enough of that.
4230820	4232500	It looks good.
4232500	4235140	Like the Horizon game looks good.
4235140	4240740	Like it's a very nice looking game, but it doesn't play like a Horizon game.
4240740	4243940	It's not like a brand like that level of gameplay.
4243940	4247300	You're not like it's not a God of War or Last of Us or anything like that.
4247300	4252180	It's just it's it's it's a neat tech demo for what you can do.
4252180	4257220	It's basically a climbing game, which I mean, that's not what people want to play.
4257220	4259460	They want to play a full fledged game.
4259460	4265460	Like if it was like Grand Theft Auto five VR and it was the full game and I could play
4265460	4266180	it in VR.
4267140	4269460	Yeah, I mean, that could probably sell some systems.
4269460	4274820	I respectfully I kind of think Grand Theft Auto five is super old news at this point.
4274820	4279140	And I think maybe a new Grand Theft Auto game that is made for VR rather than to just shoe
4279140	4283140	horning an old game into VR, I think would be a better approach.
4283140	4288100	We'll just have to wait for the the the meta group to to port over San Andreas, because
4288100	4291860	remember, that was their announcement that they're bringing San Andreas over to that.
4291860	4294740	So you want to talk about old game shoehorn to the VR.
4295940	4298980	That's a pretty old game, the shoehorn into VR.
4299540	4304900	But I mean, yeah, like I understand that, like, you know, a new game for sure.
4304900	4310020	But Grand Theft Auto five, like we already have a, you know, first person mode in that
4310020	4314820	it wouldn't be too difficult, I would think, to be able to port in VR controls.
4314820	4317620	In fact, there are mods out there for PC that you can do that.
4319540	4321540	I just think something like that would be an easy win.
4321540	4325300	But yeah, until you get something that like people really need to buy and remember, you're
4325300	4327380	just you're trying to get people to buy something.
4327460	4330980	Not only to play PlayStation five, they don't own one already, but now you have to buy
4330980	4335540	another piece of kit that's just as expensive as a PlayStation five.
4335540	4340660	That's a lot to ask in a recession, since we're going to use it as excuse there.
4342580	4346580	It's just I don't know, it's a hard sell, especially also people are waiting for like,
4346580	4351060	you know, the meta quest three to see what that's all about and what the price point
4351060	4353380	is, because the price point is most definitely probably going to be less.
4353940	4355780	And it's just it's easier.
4355780	4359940	I only have to buy that and then I can buy software for it and then I'm good to go.
4359940	4363140	Like, so it's a hard sell.
4363140	4366420	Let me get some comments to chat over at twitch.tv social network.
4366420	4371220	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, tech analysts will always say not enough sales drop the
4371220	4371860	price.
4371860	4375300	What they don't know is that even if Sony dropped the price, there isn't going to be
4375300	4378580	that demand unless you have that must have PSVR two game.
4379220	4382980	And Shane says, Shad Leland says, I think the PSVR two is great.
4382980	4383940	I know he has one.
4383940	4385700	I love mine for what I've played on it.
4385780	4389060	However, I've only used it three times since I got it.
4389060	4393140	Too many good games that keep coming out that push it farther down my list of things to
4393140	4393460	play.
4394340	4397460	Fixie said something that led to a brain spark on my end.
4397460	4402900	I want to get to this fixation gaze and chat says, I would love to see Pokemon in VR or
4402900	4404100	Legend of Zelda.
4404100	4406020	And Jamie, you're in chat too.
4406020	4410180	And I quite frankly, I was I was taken aback by this comment.
4410180	4414740	You said in a good way, you said Breath of the Wild would be the thing that would drag
4414740	4415620	me into VR.
4416660	4421620	Yeah, because I just want to walk around, you know, and I think, well, you know, the
4421620	4424740	VR stuff gives me like a pretty bad, bad headache.
4425620	4432260	Um, but I mean, I want an official Breath of the Wild in VR, not a fan project.
4432260	4434100	Yeah, in Labo.
4434100	4436580	But you're really a thing on Switch.
4437940	4439060	Okay, okay, okay.
4439060	4442980	So I want like a real VR experience, not Labo.
4442980	4445060	Okay, but here's here's the thing.
4445060	4447860	So we're all waiting for the Switch successor, right?
4449540	4455460	What if the Switch successor now I and I don't know how much I expect Nintendo to jump into
4455460	4457220	this, but I'm going to throw it out there.
4457220	4462180	What if the whole thing with the Switch successor is it's the Switch, but it's the Switch 3.
4462820	4467140	And the reason why they call it the Switch 3 and not the Switch 2 is that it's handheld,
4467860	4469620	TV, and VR.
4470420	4475540	Because do a thing with that screen, very similar to how Labo was all set up, but this
4475540	4479060	time the device is built for it.
4479060	4482660	And the third Switch, so you could, it switches three ways.
4483620	4484740	It's a three-way device.
4484740	4489140	I know it's, I, at the end of the day, I'm not sure I see Nintendo getting into this
4489140	4494420	market at all, but it's a very interesting sort of, that's something they could do to
4494420	4496660	the Switch to make it switchier.
4497460	4499700	It would be horrible is what it would be.
4499700	4505780	It would be absolutely horrible because one, you can't, you cannot put that much power
4505780	4508340	into a handheld device like that right now.
4508340	4515220	Two, the screen resolution that they're running on that is 720p, which I've played Labo VR.
4515220	4516260	It's awful.
4516260	4518180	It's not good looking.
4518180	4519060	It's cool.
4519060	4520580	It's a cool concept.
4520580	4521860	It just does not work.
4522420	4528740	Loki, that's all you need because the Switch wasn't designed to do this, but even the
4528740	4533860	fact that you said it's cool, it just wasn't designed to do it, could be fixed.
4535620	4539700	Go back though, at that low of a resolution, especially for folks like me that are prone
4539700	4543620	to migraines, it would be a nightmare, an absolute nightmare.
4543620	4546340	You have to have quality if you're going to do a VR unit.
4546340	4549700	And something that technology six years later could hopefully improve on.
4550340	4554820	If they would maybe like 30 years, they might get on board with that.
4554820	4556980	They're going to get on board with that when the train's already left.
4556980	4560900	Like there is no way that they're going to do this anytime soon because they're making
4560900	4563300	hand over fist money with what they've got right now.
4563300	4566740	They're not going to like pivot until they need to pivot.
4566740	4571140	This is why I'm not really willing to put this on the record as an official.
4571140	4574580	I believe as somebody in chat said earlier, Rob Stradamus prediction.
4574580	4575460	I'm not putting it there.
4575460	4580980	I'm just saying, ooh, I never thought of that before today, but that's a way that the switch
4580980	4582020	could get switchier.
4582020	4583940	And that's exactly the line.
4584500	4585780	Put it on the back of the box.
4585780	4587380	The switch gets switchier.
4590020	4594660	Now, like the new generation, this device participates in three ways way more often.
4595380	4601300	Well, the only way that this would take off, like you'd have to have, okay, Apple releasing
4601300	4603700	their VR headset, which are already rumors.
4603700	4607300	That's going to be several thousand dollars, but people will pay the Apple tax.
4607300	4608500	I know that absolutely.
4609140	4612500	So you get the wide adoption of VR with that.
4612500	4615140	Then maybe they may switch to that as far as the thing.
4615140	4618980	But right now, I think the direction they would go with that is consoles are getting
4618980	4620100	more powerful.
4620100	4622740	People have seen what the steam deck can do.
4622740	4627460	They're just going to put out a more powerful handheld and that'll be that.
4627460	4631060	And it'll be the same stuff over and over and over again until
4631060	4638340	there's a mass adoption where Microsoft and Sony are all releasing VR centric head systems.
4638340	4639700	They're not going to pivot to that.
4640660	4647140	I mean, I would like to think that they're trendsetters, but I think that ship has sailed
4647140	4647700	as well.
4647700	4651460	They were trendsetters when the Wii came out, and now they've been just kind of refining
4651460	4652420	that Wii process.
4652420	4654900	And now it's just kind of a novel thing.
4654900	4660980	Like how many games do people really actively take part in using the motion controls for
4661940	4665300	the Switch Sports is about it.
4665300	4668260	And that's because people like the nostalgia of going back to that.
4668260	4672660	I know my kids like playing or at least one of them likes playing the Switch Sports stuff
4672660	4674980	just because it's just fun and novel.
4674980	4679700	But like any other games, no, they're not using the motion controls because it's a handheld
4679700	4680980	system they're using as a handheld.
4680980	4686420	So if they're downplaying the features that they're building into this thing for one
4686420	4687380	already.
4687380	4692820	And also they're touting it as like a family system, a co-op same screen type of system
4692820	4693140	thing.
4693140	4696340	And I just don't see them doing that.
4696340	4699940	Yeah, they experimented with the little mini system where you can't take the Joy-Cons
4699940	4700580	off anymore.
4700580	4707060	But I just can't shake the whole.
4707060	4711460	You're right that the VR landscape might be changing pretty soon when certain players
4711460	4712340	get in the market.
4712340	4717780	But I just can't shake that feeling of that.
4717780	4722340	It does this, this and this without extra wires or any of that.
4722340	4726100	I just that's very, it's a very appealing marketing gimmick.
4728900	4729540	Oh, go ahead.
4730420	4736180	I was just going back to thinking about Labo because that being Nintendo's attempt at VR.
4738100	4740980	They could have done so much more with it, but it didn't get the support.
4741780	4748500	And I'm also thinking in terms of just that, you know, there are some technologies that
4748500	4750900	the general public isn't going to be ready for.
4750900	4754260	And I think VR right now is just is one of those.
4755140	4760020	The problem with Labo is it was, it's fun to build all the things for it, but it's so
4760020	4760500	gimmicky.
4760500	4763220	And then you're left with a bunch of like stuff like, what am I going to do with all
4763220	4763540	this?
4763540	4764820	I threw mine away.
4764820	4766900	Meaning the Labo VR, sorry.
4766900	4767940	No, I threw mine away.
4767940	4771220	I threw my Labo VR away because it was a ton.
4771860	4775940	It was a ton of cardboard that like it took up a ton of space and there was no place to
4775940	4776420	store it.
4776420	4780020	They have like a little flimsy like stand you can make to like stack some of the stuff,
4780020	4782180	but like it took up so much space.
4782180	4785940	And each one of those devices is used for one game within this.
4785940	4789700	It is it is like third party.
4789700	4792980	We accessory like nightmare stuff that they had.
4792980	4796500	And it's a it's a neat concept to get people playing games and stuff like that.
4796500	4802660	But it's, they then pivoted that into, uh, was it a game builder garage, which nobody
4802660	4803460	talks about anymore.
4803460	4806180	It probably does anything with like, cause that's once again, that's something that's
4806180	4807060	not been a focus.
4807860	4812740	It was a neat idea, but they didn't support it and too much beyond like just what they
4812740	4813540	had out for it.
4813540	4818100	And they did like this weird thing with, uh, Mario Odyssey with Labo VR.
4818100	4818900	And it was awful.
4818900	4821620	It was awful to like, look at it cause the screen was so blurry.
4822260	4828180	And I tried the one thing on yours and it made me pretty sick.
4828180	4833220	You know, I mean, one would have expected that Nintendo would have been better.
4833860	4840420	I really feel like this Labo thing is getting taken too literally as what the VR that Nintendo
4840420	4841380	could produce could be.
4841380	4843940	I see Labo as a proof of concept and nothing more.
4843940	4844580	And that's it.
4844580	4845620	Concept.
4845620	4846340	That's it.
4846340	4847940	Not actual execution.
4847940	4851300	But anyway, it's, um, I just keep an eye on time.
4851620	4853700	We're very passionate tonight on all these topics.
4853700	4855380	Let's try to move through these next few stories.
4855380	4858340	We're going to get to the classic game of, or excuse me, actually tonight we have an
4858340	4862020	on-game game of, or no, a non-video game tonight.
4862020	4863540	It's a non-video game game.
4863540	4864340	Non-video game game.
4864900	4868500	We're going to get to that in a little bit, but first we have a few more stories including,
4868500	4870660	oh yes, April Fool's day was yesterday.
4870660	4873620	We talked about that a little bit at the top of the show, how I think most of us are kind
4873620	4879300	of over April Fool's day, but occasionally there are still some hah sorts that elicit
4879300	4882740	that singular hah that come out of these sorts of things.
4882740	4885300	And I would say this was it from Sega.
4885300	4892100	Sega for April, Sega for April Fool's day released a game called the murder of Sonic
4892100	4893140	the Hedgehog.
4893140	4895380	It was a free adventure game for PCs.
4895380	4896900	It's actually still available on Steam.
4898420	4899140	Yeah, on Steam.
4899140	4899640	Great.
4901380	4906260	It's Amy Rose's murder mystery birthday party and Sonic dies.
4906260	4908260	And so now you have to find out what happened.
4908260	4910260	So I guess you could say it's a visual novel.
4910980	4914420	So I don't know if it's like a Danganronpa type of thing or maybe a little simpler than
4914420	4919460	that, but you interrogate the guests and so forth and try to figure out what's going
4919460	4919960	on.
4920900	4924420	Sega has the direction of Danganronpa though.
4924420	4927220	Probably not to that extreme, but I got the game.
4927860	4930580	But anyway, yeah, those, those types of things.
4930580	4933220	That's when April Fool's day is funny and actually cute.
4933220	4934820	So I thought that was cool.
4935300	4938500	Um, you know, that's how hot to full boyfriend started.
4938500	4939300	Yeah.
4939300	4939620	Right.
4939620	4943380	Well online April Fool's joke and to bring things full circle.
4943380	4948580	Pokemon go started as the Google maps April Fool's joke about three years prior.
4948580	4952260	So sometimes pretty legit things come from April Fool's day.
4952260	4955220	There was some other silly, silly stuff like the Blizzard Diablo.
4955220	4957140	Twitter was announcing all this nonsense.
4957140	4961460	Although I don't know, it was, they were doing things like the butcher will manifest in real
4961460	4964420	life and come strangle or come slaughter you.
4964420	4965540	That was the word slaughter you.
4965540	4969860	And I just replied, I put slaughter me daddy because they had a picture of the butcher.
4971940	4974020	I agree with, with Gwen Pudding.
4975300	4977700	Um, we must find the pudding.
4977700	4984420	Also they see sometimes the fans do somewhat amusing things on Reddit, the world of Warcraft
4984420	4989700	or wow Reddit and the final fantasy 14 Reddit literally swapped skins for the day.
4989700	4994180	So when you went to the wow Reddit, it said final fantasy 14 and Walker, all the topics
4994180	4997700	and posts were still there, but it was also the mods behind the scenes.
4997700	4998260	Both agree.
4998260	4999140	I love that.
4999140	5005220	So world of Warcraft fans and Final Fantasy 14 fans coming together to achieve total internet
5005220	5006020	fuckery.
5006020	5006900	You love to see it.
5007940	5013780	I like the IGNs where they had like a video talking about those features being added by
5013780	5014420	Nintendo.
5014420	5018660	They did like a mock Nintendo direct where they're adding voice lines from the Mario
5018660	5020020	movie into like Mario games.
5020020	5020900	No, I hated that.
5022260	5022660	Silly.
5022660	5023540	Hated it.
5023540	5026500	All right, moving on Dark Sakura.
5027620	5034100	All right, well multiverses, um, their open beta is going to be closing on June 25th.
5034660	5041620	The full launch is ready for early 2024 with some new features and new modes, but that
5041620	5043860	free to play one is going away.
5044580	5056500	Um, I, uh, according to their FAQ, um, again, June 25th, um, and they haven't yet provided
5056500	5058580	the time, but they will closer they get to it.
5059220	5065300	Um, and then they said that it's closing because they've got lots of feedback and they
5065300	5070580	have some work to do along with the net code and matchmaking and working on the progression
5070580	5071300	systems.
5071380	5079860	So they are again targeting early 2024 and it will be removed from digital storefronts
5079860	5083220	and unavailable for download beginning on April 4th.
5084020	5085780	So Tuesday.
5086820	5087300	Yeah.
5087300	5089460	If you're going to get it, now's the time.
5090020	5093460	But yeah, I'm surprised that that was in beta.
5093460	5094580	Like I thought that came out.
5094580	5096740	I thought they were selling DLC for that and everything.
5096740	5098260	I think it's a convenient.
5099940	5100580	There's more.
5100580	5101080	Okay.
5101620	5105860	The season two battle pass, which is supposed to end on March 31st will be extended through
5105860	5106660	June 25th.
5107380	5112500	Um, and so the daily missions will keep going and the battle pass points and all of that
5112500	5113860	until the game is taken offline.
5114660	5118100	There will be no more, the weekly seasonal milestones.
5118100	5119620	So there you go.
5119620	5127620	So season two in an open beta, but one good thing is that for any content that you've
5127620	5130980	earned or purchased in game will carry over to the full version of the game.
5132100	5136340	I have a feeling a lot of this is because there's less and less people playing multiverses.
5136340	5142180	And so they're gonna, they're Final Fantasy 14 it, they're going to take it down to fix
5142180	5147140	it all up and get to relaunch it again and get all the press release and stuff and get
5147140	5150260	another go at fixing some of the problems people have with it first time.
5150260	5151620	I think that's exactly what this is.
5152900	5154260	So I know.
5154260	5154740	Yep.
5154740	5156420	But it's their decision.
5156420	5156920	Yeah.
5157780	5158580	All right.
5158580	5159540	Moving on Loki.
5159860	5168180	So Australia, um, their government wants to give 18 plus ratings to any game with simulated
5168180	5169620	gambling in it.
5169620	5176820	And that could be anything that includes like actual gambling to loot boxes.
5176820	5182420	So anything that actually has like a loot box or some sort of like random element to,
5182420	5187620	you know, unlocking things that you pay for would be considered an M rated game.
5187700	5190660	Would a stock market simulation be considered an M rated game then?
5191460	5193380	I mean, it is, it is gambling.
5193380	5197300	It seems like, so yeah, I would think that that does, um, you know, this
5197300	5201300	Bobby Black Wolf with an excellent point with super Mario brothers three toad house, would
5201300	5203780	that be considered a M rated cause it's gambling.
5204500	5208420	I think it's because you're actually, they're talking about stuff that you pay for like
5208420	5209620	with money in the game.
5209620	5215380	So like if, if for example, in super Mario brothers three toad house, if they did the
5215380	5221220	re-release of that game where I could buy toad coins with real money and then buy stuff
5221220	5224500	randomly toad house, then yes, that would be a mature rated game.
5225860	5226740	I don't like that.
5227780	5228020	Yeah.
5228020	5232180	So if, if, um, you know, they're talking about like, you know, so like, for example, like
5232180	5237220	Roblox or something like that, if you like pay Roblox to unlock a loot box, it's got
5237220	5240900	random stuff in it, then that would be an M rated game.
5241540	5247700	Um, so, and that of course affects, you know, EA's, FIFA and Madden and all that stuff
5247700	5248020	too.
5248020	5250020	So good.
5250900	5255700	See, as far as like the, the loot box argument goes, it seems a little late to the party,
5255700	5261460	but I mean, I still feel like there's a lot that needs to be kind of quantified in there
5261460	5263140	about what does gambling really mean?
5263140	5267220	But I think if you're talking about the real money currency, then, then it makes a lot
5267220	5267780	more sense.
5267780	5272020	As long as they're kind of saying real money to this, I, it makes a lot more sense.
5272660	5278900	But now here's the thing though, is M rating in Australia doesn't necessarily mean over
5278900	5279460	18.
5279460	5282100	It means, you know, 15 plus.
5282100	5285860	So, you know, it's recommended for people over 15.
5285860	5287940	So imagine like a teen rated game.
5287940	5294260	It won't legally keep games out of the kids' hands, but, uh, they said that the, oh, the
5294260	5299220	stricter MA 15 plus legally restricts the product of over age of 15.
5299220	5303540	So it's not that it's going to prevent kids from buying it.
5303540	5306580	It's just going to be like rated higher, which parents don't read that anyway.
5306580	5312100	So, you know, kids will still have them, but it's a start, I guess.
5313220	5313860	All right.
5313860	5320500	Well, moving on to the end of Steam on some platforms, but it's not what you think.
5320500	5323940	Steam is going to stop supporting Windows 7 and Windows 8.
5324340	5331300	Next year in 2024, uh, from the 1st of January, 2024, Steam will no longer work on Windows
5331300	5340260	7, 8, and nope, not even 8.1, uh, in an update that, um, I'm assuming that is already sunsetted
5340260	5342260	with XP, uh, to be quick.
5342260	5345060	No, I want Steam on Windows 3.11 for networking.
5345060	5350020	Which honestly, honestly, pour one out for the old show computer we used to use up until
5350020	5356020	the Twitch with the Twitch transition in 20 at the end of 2018, right?
5356020	5358660	December, 2018 was the Twitch transition.
5358660	5364260	We moved to a Mac mini to do video, but up until then 2018, I was running the show on
5364260	5369620	a Windows XP computer and I got shit for it all the time, but I was like, Hey, if it ain't
5369620	5371860	broke, I ain't fixing it.
5371860	5372820	End of story.
5373940	5378260	Finally, all these years later, now it's being broadcast for Windows 11.
5378260	5380740	So I'll be fine from the Steam front and all that stuff.
5380740	5385220	But anyway, uh, there are still people out there running Windows 7 and 8.
5385220	5389060	They have not yet taken the leap to even 10, uh, or 11.
5390020	5393300	But, uh, that's their problem and not everybody else's.
5393300	5393860	Yeah.
5393860	5394980	But you know, if you-
5394980	5398020	Security concern, considering that they've stopped supporting it.
5398020	5402660	Or maybe you want to consider a dual boot for like Linux or something that Steam is
5402660	5403380	supporting it on.
5403380	5403780	I don't know.
5403780	5408340	But the point is, it ain't going to work for you as of January 1st.
5409060	5413940	So if you want to continue to run Steam, including any game or product through the platform,
5413940	5416180	that could be a yikes for some people too.
5416180	5418340	You're going to need to update Windows.
5419220	5426660	And for the five people who will be all up in arms about it, the company is not responsible
5426660	5427940	for you being on obsolete tech.
5427940	5433140	Mm-hmm, bonds 006 says Windows XP.
5433140	5434900	Dan, you are a legend for that, Rob.
5434900	5435780	Oh, thank you.
5436580	5437780	Flattery will get you everywhere.
5437780	5438500	Thank you.
5438500	5442820	Uh, DJ Rob S says, of course, unless I'm a legend in a wanted poster somewhere.
5442820	5445060	Uh, DJ Rob S says support has ended.
5445060	5448900	Only select companies are paying for extended Windows 7 support.
5448900	5450900	And Valve clearly isn't one of them.
5451620	5452500	All right.
5452580	5458340	I just think it was funny that the one time Dan thought he was going to do me a good deed
5458340	5460580	and upgrade the OS on my old PC.
5461620	5462900	Windows ME broke it.
5464980	5465540	All right.
5465540	5470660	We are going to take a trip down memory lane for our next segment.
5470660	5471620	Let's get to it.
5471620	5487540	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
5487540	5489780	out a classic and tell you about it.
5489780	5493060	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5493060	5500980	But as we know, in this twist, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game once a month each month
5500980	5503140	in 20- each month of the year in 2023.
5503140	5504020	What did you pick tonight?
5505220	5506180	I picked the Bop-It.
5507220	5507700	Bop-It.
5507700	5511140	The most annoying toy in the world.
5511140	5511540	Pull it.
5513380	5514740	Oh, my mother's had one.
5514740	5515700	I hated that thing.
5515700	5526500	Anyway, Bop-It is an audio gaming toy, sort of- I'd say not unlike the Simon that I did
5526500	5527140	last month.
5528500	5532820	And it would give you a series of audio commands that, you know, had a little voice recorded
5532820	5540340	through a speaker and you would have to do those commands when it says that with it getting
5540340	5541620	increasingly more difficult.
5542260	5549620	Which I randomly one night got really bored and found someone get the world Bop-It record
5549620	5550340	on YouTube.
5551700	5552500	I'm like, whatever.
5553460	5554900	Like speed running Bop-It.
5556900	5567380	But anyway, it was a really popular thing, I think.
5567380	5569060	I mean, like I said, my brothers had it.
5569620	5580820	And it had- there's a statement on here about people were actually using it to engage in
5580820	5587700	social behavior and that there were various different versions that were released and
5588340	5598500	even a diagnostic mode that would tell you like what version of the little system it
5598500	5598740	was.
5600980	5609940	So at any rate, it sold a bunch and there were just so many things out.
5611460	5613460	But we'll go ahead and start with the very beginning.
5613460	5621860	So 1986, the instructions were copyrighted and then the game was the first of what was
5621860	5625940	going to become a series of Bop-It games with, you know, the basic patent.
5625940	5627380	The original game was called Bop-It.
5627380	5633780	It had three inputs, a pressable button in the center, a twist-it lever, and a pull-it
5633780	5634100	lever.
5636020	5640260	In three game modes, there was solo bop, vox bop, and beat bop.
5641140	5647700	So you would have those different means of playing and it would give you the command
5647700	5649780	and you had to do the command in the right amount of time.
5652020	5655380	So, you know, you had your little twist-it crank and it made a little noise and
5655940	5662820	at any rate, your score comes out with a maximum value up to 100.
5663700	5668340	There's a different model in 2000 that could score up to 200.
5669220	5679060	And each pull-it whistle, like at its end sequence, would denote 100 points and each
5679060	5680820	ratchet denotes 10.
5680820	5682580	And then a drumbeat would do one point.
5683140	5686660	So if you reach 200 points, the game will play a victory song.
5688340	5693380	And then they repeated this in later models and the Zingit spin-off.
5695220	5700180	But the cipher values were used for all of the subsequent Bop-It ciphers.
5701220	5703460	The original one used three AA batteries.
5704100	5708500	Following that was the Bop-It Extreme, which looks like a really bizarre steering wheel.
5709460	5718260	It came out in 1998, where the patent was filed with other patents as pending.
5719540	5725940	It had the additional commands of flick-it with a green zigzag lever and spin-it, which
5725940	5731460	was a wheel at the end, a red wheel, and it had four game modes.
5731460	5740820	So it added in beat bop, it had vox bop, beat bop, vox bop solo, and beat bop solo,
5740820	5746580	I can't say those words, with a maximum score increase of 250.
5747460	5750900	And it had like different victory songs that you would get.
5750900	5754340	And it also ran on three AA batteries.
5754340	5759380	And as of 2003, this was actually one of the most popular games on the market.
5759940	5767780	Then out came a Bop-It Extreme 2, which basically had like some clear elements, but all the
5767780	5768340	same shit.
5768980	5772660	And it was awarded the Electronic Game of the Year in 2005 in the UK.
5772660	5774820	It also required three AA batteries.
5775860	5783300	Some of the inputs were altered, it had volume controls, and it had the scoring just put
5783300	5784580	everything out in words.
5784580	5794740	And there was a German-speaking version that had the name Simon Challenge.
5795780	5798900	Bratz Bop-It came out, and guess what?
5798900	5799300	Hell yeah.
5799300	5802020	It used three AAA batteries.
5803700	5809700	So then it was more of a layout, like the three input one had the same scoring system,
5809700	5810820	all the rest of the same stuff.
5810820	5811620	It was just a repackage.
5812260	5821380	Bop-It Blast was developed by Tiger Electronics, and it had the same three input with more
5821380	5822820	patents pending.
5822820	5825380	It had an optional female voice.
5826340	5827860	You could use both voices.
5828420	5829780	Had victory songs.
5829780	5831460	It used three AA batteries.
5831460	5834020	And this high score on it was 500 points.
5834980	5845540	Then Bop-It Download, which had three game modes, solo, pass it, and one-on-one with
5845540	5848660	15 levels of difficulty with a max score of 1,000.
5848660	5855220	And to let you download a program to download new content, it was discontinued when Hasbro
5855220	5858180	discontinued the item, the download service.
5858180	5864820	And the level up sound was taken from this Bop-It to be used in later Bop-It models.
5865700	5869700	So the current versions on the market right now, we have Bop-It exclamation point.
5873460	5877940	It has options to shout it, which makes you shout into a microphone.
5878500	5880580	And then three difficulty levels.
5881940	5885540	The highest difficulty does voice sound and color commands.
5886340	5888660	So, and that was the one I watched someone get, by the way.
5889300	5890820	That was pretty, pretty intense.
5891460	5899860	They also added a party mode where you could use body parts like foot, hip, and arm.
5899860	5901300	Use three AAA batteries.
5902020	5904580	And when you turn it off, it says, I'm going to sleep.
5907060	5912500	And then it had Bop-It bounce, which I don't get this one.
5912500	5918660	It has a ball and a handheld trampoline, I guess that you could bounce it on.
5919300	5920100	That one's weird.
5920660	5927380	But there was the Bop-It XT, which was the fourth edition of the Bop-It extreme.
5927380	5929540	And it had a new command called shake it.
5929540	5938500	The spin is now an orange is a Bop-It smash, which had a color changing lights in the zone.
5938500	5943220	And you would smash the two Bop-It buttons together when the light was either green or blue.
5943860	5946340	And it had many other things.
5946340	5951860	There's Bop-It Tetris, which I had no idea.
5951860	5953060	Bop-It Tetris.
5953060	5954580	I'm not, I can't even.
5955460	5962100	Bop-It Beats, where you have these modes called classic, classic party, DJ, DJ party,
5962100	5966260	and remix with three difficulty levels, rookie, expert, and lights only.
5967220	5970740	You could Bop-It, spin it, scratch it, reverse it, repeat, and flip it.
5972260	5974500	You can put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
5981060	5982900	No, sorry.
5982900	5987620	And then there was the Bop-It micro series that were teeny tiny little Bop-Its.
5988180	5991860	And the other ones that they had different branded ones too.
5991940	5995940	There was Bop-It R2-D2, BB-8, Groot, and Minion.
5995940	5998260	Because Minions are on fucking everything.
5998260	6000580	There was also an Olaf and a Chewbacca.
6001540	6006740	And then there's one for the child, AKA Grogu.
6008260	6010420	The only two names that are acceptable for the creature.
6012020	6016820	And there's a Spider-Man one and all kinds of other ones.
6016820	6019140	And there's even one shaped like Darth Vader.
6019540	6023700	But the Darth Vader one had Emperor Palpatine saying the commands.
6023700	6024820	And I don't get that either.
6026260	6030500	So there were Bop-It New Moves, AKA Bop-It Refresh.
6031700	6036020	Bop-It Maker, where I guess you could design your own Bop-It stuff.
6040100	6042020	It's got different things in there.
6043220	6044820	I'm not reading everyone.
6044820	6046660	I'm just listing all the names of them now.
6046660	6052820	There was the original re-release, the classic re-release, the all kinds of modes.
6052820	6055620	I mean, my goodness, this game mutates.
6056260	6058580	It is not called that.
6059140	6061300	It is Grogu or the child.
6061300	6063460	We have never seen Yoda as an infant.
6063460	6064100	The end.
6064100	6068100	The random video I came across on YouTube and the recommends for the ones you sent
6068100	6070660	had this guy that's got like 40 different Bop-Its.
6070660	6073060	I was like, there's that many that exist?
6073060	6074020	My goodness.
6074420	6080740	What about the one where finally it's become it's the AI has taken over and now the device bops you?
6083060	6086420	I saw one that was done at this weird.
6086420	6091060	So like I used to take my kids to this event that they had back when they're really little,
6091060	6096740	like they were like babies that basically had a bunch of like cars, like fire trucks
6096740	6097540	and stuff like that.
6097540	6103300	But they also had these vehicles that someone made for Burning Man.
6103300	6107300	And they had a Bop-It with flamethrowers in this big metal cage.
6107300	6108180	They get to play it.
6108180	6111940	That's the same people that made the DDR machine that shot fire at you when you got a stamp.
6111940	6112500	Yeah, probably.
6112500	6113000	Yeah.
6113620	6115780	But obviously it didn't shoot fire at you.
6118020	6119620	There are the sister products.
6120580	6121300	Oh, boy.
6121300	6123860	Zingit, which is a yo-yo audio game.
6124980	6128500	There's Toppit, which is a Kendama style.
6128500	6132340	You know, the cup ball thing that you do in the cup?
6132340	6134420	That one exists.
6134420	6140900	There's one called Torx, which has two twistable circles and two bendable arms that can be
6140900	6143220	bent in 90 degree angles.
6143220	6145300	And it sounds too complicated.
6145300	6153620	And then Groove-It, where very much like the Bop-It games, it uses a photo detection to
6153620	6155620	determine where your hand position is.
6156260	6158180	And it uses voice commands.
6158260	6162980	But now you have the scratch, the slide, the zoom, and it's more tolerant of errors because
6162980	6164180	of hand things.
6164180	6169860	And then it's got, like, some of the other ones, as you progress through the game, it's
6169860	6170360	got...
6172660	6173140	Fixie.
6173140	6173700	Okay, I get it.
6175220	6178260	You didn't see my reaction over here when you were talking about Toppit.
6179060	6179700	I did.
6179700	6180200	I did.
6181940	6186020	Well, I didn't see your reaction because I was reading the thing, but yeah.
6186660	6187220	Not that.
6188180	6190020	You know, and then the sequel, Bottom-It.
6192900	6196420	They haven't yet come out with Verse-It yet because people are convinced it doesn't exist.
6196420	6197540	It's 2023.
6197540	6199060	It's perfectly acceptable to cite it.
6200660	6207780	At any rate, Groove-It also adds other commands like the chop, the zip, the flow, the car
6207780	6211300	wash, the rock and roll, the kung fu, the swirl, and the hip hop.
6212100	6212980	And that is it.
6213700	6214580	Oh, is that all?
6214580	6219380	Groove is bottom-it.
6220740	6224340	I've learned more about a Bop-It than I ever thought I would in my entire life.
6224340	6229540	But no, it's fascinating just how many of those fucking things there have been over
6229540	6229940	the years.
6229940	6230580	That's for sure.
6230580	6236980	And my favorite, though, way to do Bop-It is just to smack people in the head with it
6236980	6240020	when they bother me and say, no, I was just following the game.
6240020	6241220	Like I said, Bop-You.
6244580	6248420	Bop-It is my Bop-It.
6248420	6250020	Get out my cane and my Geritol.
6250660	6251940	We called it dodgeball.
6252820	6254180	If you didn't dodge, you got bopped.
6254900	6256420	I remember Lorena Bop-It.
6256420	6257700	That was a heck of a trial.
6258500	6259220	Oh, my God.
6260980	6263780	And that poor woman.
6264660	6266980	Also, what else was I going to say?
6266980	6268740	I had another joke I was sitting on.
6268740	6269780	Oh, well, forget it.
6269780	6271940	I don't think her situation was funny, though.
6271940	6273380	She was an abused woman.
6277540	6279300	Damn, I had another dad joke and it left.
6279300	6279800	Oh, well.
6281780	6282180	Let's see.
6282740	6283780	All right, there it is.
6283780	6289700	Bop-It, your classic not video game game of electronic not video game.
6289700	6290580	That's what I'm going to call it.
6290580	6292340	All right, of the month.
6292340	6298020	I'll change the name next month, which, you know, funny enough, a lot of these things
6298020	6300980	we've been talking about, you know, Simon last month, Bop-It this month, y'all have
6300980	6302020	played them at some point.
6302020	6302980	Jenga was one.
6302980	6304420	Y'all have played these things.
6304420	6311380	So you can't say they don't like, you know, have some things in common with video games,
6311380	6313700	especially, you know, in regards to the fandom and stuff.
6313700	6317060	But yeah, anyway, wait till you find out what next month is.
6317060	6317620	Oh, boy.
6317620	6318420	All right.
6318420	6319300	Are there two?
6319300	6323460	Actually, that's the part I have been finding fascinating is like the 200 different versions
6323460	6326180	of Simon and the 200 different versions of Bop-It.
6326180	6328340	It's like, okay, I legit did not know.
6328340	6332740	That's I still don't understand Super Simon, but maybe one day I will.
6333460	6335140	Well, we never got it over here.
6335140	6339140	I happened to play somebody who lived overseas.
6339780	6340580	I played bears.
6341220	6343220	All right, moving on.
6343220	6347700	Let's travel around and check out some quick news in rapid fire news.
6347700	6348200	Loki.
6349060	6349460	Yes.
6349460	6353940	So there's been an old Atari game prototype that's been discovered.
6354420	6359700	So Sonar, which is almost I guess it sort of plays like Battleship.
6361540	6362260	So that's pretty cool.
6362260	6368100	So Atari Protos, they says Sonar apparently is missing some features because it's incomplete.
6369860	6377460	And so some of the hiccups include flickering, which you using the Sonar scan and also has
6377460	6378900	one pre-programmed map.
6379540	6380500	But that's pretty cool.
6380500	6381700	Something that could have been.
6382660	6387220	And the ROM itself has been posted to Atari Age if you're interested in checking it out.
6388660	6394580	Of course, if you have checked out Marvel's Avengers or were planning on doing it,
6394580	6396420	you got news for you that they're canceling that.
6396420	6402660	But in the meantime, if you have checked out Marvel Avengers, you can actually get the
6402660	6404500	unlocks for the game for free.
6404500	6409220	They've unlocked pretty much everything for the game for free because, yes, it is being
6409220	6412740	taken offline, but that's pretty cool.
6412740	6417860	So the marketplace has been mostly unlocked thanks to the update.
6417860	6421220	2.8 unlocks nearly all marketplace items for free.
6421940	6427460	And yeah, you can go check it out before it's taken down.
6429380	6429780	All right.
6429780	6430420	Dark Sakura.
6431700	6433060	Samba de Amigo.
6434500	6439060	Gosh, one of my favorite games, but Party Central is going to have some Sonic the Hedgehog
6439060	6441700	content, including Sonic also playing.
6442500	6447860	But for some of the songs, we have Escape from the City from Sonic Adventure 2 and Fistbump
6447860	6448980	from Sonic Forces.
6449940	6454500	And then there's a stage called City Escape as in the one from Sonic Adventure 2 with
6455220	6456900	Sonic as a playable character.
6458100	6461780	Although, why couldn't they have done like Speed Highway?
6461780	6463620	That would have been so much better.
6464580	6469700	If anyone who doesn't know what it is, City Escape is the one that's kind of like San
6469700	6474260	Francisco, like almost a crazy taxi-ish kind of level.
6475860	6478260	But yeah, it's going to be out for Switch this summer.
6479220	6481220	I don't see a date, but it'll be out.
6483300	6483800	All right.
6484980	6490900	Let's check out real quick some of the freebies coming to the extended platforms on PlayStation
6490900	6492260	and Xbox.
6492260	6494100	PlayStation Plus, the essentials.
6494100	6496020	So what free games are you getting with that?
6496020	6496980	Some interesting ones.
6496980	6500580	Meet Your Maker is going to be the free game for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.
6500580	6502980	This one's interesting because it's going to be a day one release.
6503860	6507940	This is the new game from Behavior Entertainment, although I don't believe it's anything to
6507940	6509140	do with horror or anything like that.
6509140	6512900	It sounds more like a building fortress type of thing.
6513460	6514580	It kind of is scary.
6514580	6515220	Oh, interesting.
6515220	6515720	Okay.
6516120	6522920	So Meet Your Maker is you build different levels a la kind of Mario Maker, but there's
6522920	6524600	death traps all the way through them.
6524600	6525320	Oh, okay.
6525320	6525960	Interesting.
6525960	6529000	You have to get to the center, get something and get out.
6529560	6533720	And every time it keeps track of your deaths as you go through it.
6533720	6534920	It's not a bad game.
6534920	6535800	I was in the beta.
6537000	6540680	It wasn't my cup of tea, but it's a great game.
6540680	6544600	Well, and the good news about it being on PlayStation Plus is that people will be able
6544600	6545080	to grab it.
6545080	6547800	And, you know, for better or for worse, I haven't played this game.
6547800	6552600	I have no idea if it's good or not from my perspective, but I do know things like Rocket
6552600	6557240	League have launched day one on PlayStation and been very, very successful as a result.
6557240	6558200	So we'll see what happens.
6559720	6562600	Also, other games for PlayStation.
6562600	6563960	I'm very excited about this.
6563960	6565560	Sackboy, A Big Adventure.
6565560	6569480	That was one of the first titles on PlayStation 5, but it's also on PlayStation 4.
6569480	6574680	That is, it's not LittleBigPlanet, but it's LittleBigPlanet's mascot in a somewhat LittleBigPlanet
6575000	6575560	type of game.
6576360	6578520	That is the best cosplay.
6578520	6578840	Yes.
6578840	6582680	And it just doesn't have the build your own stuff, but it looks like it'll be fun.
6582680	6585800	And Tales of Iron is also going to be available.
6585800	6589480	That is an RPG that it'll be available as well.
6589480	6592040	That's all coming in April, starting April 4th.
6592040	6597000	So on Tuesday, which a reminder, if you want to get the March games, which includes Minecraft
6597000	6600920	Dungeons on PlayStation and some of the other releases, I forget what all was there.
6600920	6603080	I think one of the Call of Duty games was this month.
6603080	6604440	You can grab those before they're gone.
6605480	6609880	Over on the Microsoft side of the house, two new games announced for April.
6609880	6612200	I got to admit, these are more under the radar games.
6612200	6617400	I'm not familiar with these like the other side, but we do have Out of Space Couch Edition
6617960	6620520	will be available April 1st through April 30th.
6620520	6627400	And Peaky Blinders Mastermind will be available from April 16th to May 15th because Microsoft
6627400	6630040	does that interesting middle of the month switch that they do over there.
6631000	6634520	So neither of these games are high dollar games.
6635080	6635960	Out of Space is a $10 game.
6635960	6638040	Peaky Blinders is a $25 game.
6638040	6639720	So I will kind of point.
6639720	6642600	Space sounds like it'd be like a hoarders game.
6642600	6643320	Yeah, I don't know.
6643320	6643720	I don't know.
6643720	6647800	So, but again, I don't want to poop with these games just because they're lower studios.
6647800	6650680	I haven't, sometimes those are the best games to come out on these things.
6650680	6655320	So, but they're just, they're games I'm unaware of as of yet, but Xbox games with gold will
6655320	6657720	give me the chance to grab them for free and try them out.
6658600	6659080	All right.
6659080	6663080	Let's travel around the world and check out what games are coming out this week that you
6663080	6664120	can pay full price for.
6664840	6666040	Or maybe, maybe on sale.
6666040	6666600	We'll see.
6666600	6667560	Loki, how about the US?
6668760	6674440	We have Grim Grimoire Once More on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
6675080	6680360	Meet Your Maker on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.
6681000	6687560	Road 96, Mile Zero on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and
6687560	6688440	Xbox Series.
6689080	6695400	Curse of the Sea Rats on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and
6695400	6696280	Xbox Series.
6697000	6699640	Dungeons of Aether on Nintendo Switch.
6700520	6705720	Everspace 2 on PC, Mac, and Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6706920	6713560	Looks like Marfusha on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6714520	6723320	Paparazzi on Nintendo Switch, EA Sports PGA Tour on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.
6724360	6727720	And then we'll also have, oh, that's it.
6727720	6728600	Actually, that is it.
6729720	6730200	All right.
6730760	6735000	Traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases over there, we will start with the
6735000	6741720	Nintendo Switch because we don't really do the Xbox releases in Japan for reasons that
6741720	6743480	we've talked about earlier in the show.
6743960	6748360	But we will mention some of the games that are releasing on the Switch on April the,
6750040	6752840	actually, I don't think we have any releases in Japan this week.
6753640	6754280	Wait, wait, wait.
6754280	6756120	It's not, is it, hold on.
6757000	6758200	Oh, it is April.
6758760	6762840	It might be, yeah, because we don't have any big releases in Japan.
6762840	6763720	Not even on the...
6763720	6766920	Actually, Golden Week is April 29th.
6766920	6768760	It is the end of the month.
6768760	6769000	Yeah.
6769640	6769800	Yeah.
6770680	6771320	There is...
6771320	6773720	But I knew Golden Week was around April.
6773720	6774520	April-ish, yeah.
6775720	6776280	Yeah.
6776280	6779400	For whatever reason, it's a non-week week in Japan.
6779400	6781400	There's really nothing releasing over there.
6781400	6782760	There's like an AC adapter.
6784280	6785720	You need a third party one of those.
6785720	6790200	Everyone do extra work so that you can take the week off for Golden Week week.
6790200	6791080	Yeah, I guess so.
6791880	6793800	Nope, no releases this week.
6794680	6795000	Okay.
6795000	6797080	We do have stuff on the 13th, though, but that's next week.
6797880	6801400	Well, in the UK, we have a handful of releases.
6802120	6805320	On April 4th on Switch, we have Hello Neighbor 2.
6806040	6809160	And on Switch also, we have the Hello Neighbor 2 Deluxe Edition.
6810360	6813960	On PlayStation and Xbox, we have Firefighting Sim The Squad.
6814680	6818360	On the 6th for PlayStation and Switch, we have Curse of the Sea Rats.
6819480	6825000	Also on the 6th for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, Blade Assault.
6825880	6831000	And on the 7th on PlayStation and Xbox, we have EA Sports PGA Tour.
6832120	6832620	Yawn.
6833800	6835400	I want them to have, though...
6835400	6839480	Okay, you know what will make golf games interesting to me?
6840840	6842520	Add Drunk Scotsman mode.
6845320	6846840	Play the Kirby golf game.
6846840	6848760	That would be my take.
6850280	6854600	Go back and listen to Robin Williams describing the creation of golf.
6854600	6858200	And then I want that to be the announcer in the game with lots
6858200	6861000	of Drunk Scotsman, and that would make it an interesting game.
6862840	6864280	I mean, we could do that now with AI.
6865000	6865640	New dream game.
6867480	6870680	I just realized I'm looking at the game playing behind Loki tonight,
6870680	6872360	because I saw the whole isometric.
6872360	6874120	I wasn't really paying attention to it until now.
6874120	6875000	I saw the whole isometric.
6875000	6877640	I was like, oh, is that Kirby's Dream Course?
6877640	6880920	Oh, no, it's a Sonic Endless Runner of some sort.
6880920	6881560	What is that?
6881560	6885560	No, it's the Sonic Has Been Murdered game.
6885560	6887400	Oh, and I haven't played it yet.
6887400	6888120	Okay.
6888120	6888520	Yeah.
6888520	6892120	And wasn't that, like, the isometric mode from 3D Blast?
6892680	6894440	Oh, I swear to kind of.
6894440	6897400	It was that arcade game that I covered for Classic Game, like,
6897400	6898840	an age ago that was really weird.
6898840	6901240	I looked at just the right time where I saw a minigame and not
6901240	6903000	the actual murder part.
6903000	6903500	Okay.
6904200	6904680	All right.
6904680	6906120	Please do not murder a Sonic.
6906120	6907240	Okay, thanks, bye.
6907240	6910280	Let's do a few more stories, and then we will invite your phone
6910280	6912840	calls over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
6912840	6914840	But first, we have a few more stories.
6914840	6916520	This one is fascinating to me.
6916520	6917020	Loki?
6917720	6921640	Yes, apparently the makers of Dolphin have announced that
6921640	6926360	the GameCube and Wii emulator is coming to Steam early access
6926360	6927160	later this year.
6928120	6931640	So the emulator obviously will be in there, but, you know,
6931640	6933160	the ROMs will not.
6935160	6939320	He said our great experiment, Dolphin is coming to Steam.
6939320	6942280	We're pleased to finally tell the world of our experiment.
6942280	6945640	This has been a product of many months of work, and we look
6945640	6948760	forward to getting it into users' hands soon.
6948760	6951000	It says while Dolphin's Steam page is already live, the
6951000	6953320	emulator will be officially available through Valve's
6953320	6955400	storefront until sometime in the next few months.
6957160	6959800	It says the Dolphin emulator does not come with games.
6959800	6964040	We do not condone piracy of any shape or form, and this
6964040	6967080	software is built to run legally acquired games.
6967640	6970520	I wonder how quickly it's going to be before Nintendo tries
6970520	6971640	to take this down.
6971640	6973640	Although I don't know if they really, I mean, maybe they
6973640	6977960	can, as long as it's no part of their actual, like, no system
6977960	6979720	bias or anything like that.
6979720	6981480	I don't know.
6981480	6985400	Yeah, I'm seriously curious about the legality of this.
6985400	6989400	I also find this news was very oddly timed because this
6989400	6992440	news came out literally a day after the 3DS and Wii U shops
6992440	6992840	went down.
6992840	6996760	And I know that this is about GameCube and Wii games, but
6996760	6999560	there's a part of me that wonders, maybe the Wii U shop
6999560	7003960	going down rendering Wii games unbuyable, if there's something
7003960	7005320	going on with that.
7005320	7010440	Technically, you can play like the WiiWare stuff, or I don't
7010440	7011080	know what they call it.
7011080	7014280	I think it's the WiiWare through those emulators.
7014280	7017080	So yeah, it'll be interesting.
7017080	7019080	I mean, and to be fair, that's the only way you're going to
7019080	7024120	be able to do things like Final Fantasy IV, the after years,
7024120	7026360	the non-graphically enhanced versions.
7026520	7028840	Some of those were that actually look like the old games.
7028840	7031080	That was all on the WiiWare.
7031080	7032920	So interesting.
7034920	7036120	Interesting, interesting.
7036120	7037560	Okay, moving on.
7037560	7038200	Dark Sakura.
7039560	7045080	Well, something that we touched about was about Silent Hill 2
7045080	7047160	remake being effectively done.
7047160	7049160	And there was some clarification released on that.
7050040	7057560	Bloober Team did address what was considered an accurate
7057560	7058200	translation.
7060200	7063640	They say it is not true that we announced Silent Hill 2 is
7063640	7064440	ready for release.
7064440	7066600	I am reading this from a quote.
7066600	7069080	Regardless of the development stage, all of our activities
7069080	7072200	are focused on obtaining the highest quality for the finished
7072840	7073320	product.
7073320	7079080	The quality of fans of Silent Hill 2
7080120	7080200	deserve.
7080200	7083480	The statement refers to sales forecasts, which were referenced
7083480	7084200	in the article.
7084840	7089480	And the studio's previous games reached a sales ceiling of
7089480	7092680	2 million copies, but they were aiming for 10 million.
7093240	7097320	So right now, then they were basically more talking about
7097320	7100280	forecast and not about the actual game being done.
7101560	7108120	So, but their end quote on this is saying that we are aware
7108200	7110680	that players are waiting for more information about Silent
7110680	7111560	Hill 2.
7111560	7114200	As soon as such information becomes available, we are sure
7114200	7116840	that Konami, the publisher of the game, will share it with
7116840	7117240	fans.
7118280	7119560	So that's it.
7120360	7124600	And honestly, with the whole, like, summer fest stuff seems
7124600	7127640	like a good time to give more information about that type
7127640	7128440	of stuff.
7128440	7131160	You know, just it's only a couple months away.
7131160	7131960	Hang on, people.
7132520	7133000	Hang on.
7133960	7134920	Keep your pants on.
7135800	7136520	Actually, don't.
7136520	7137160	Take them off.
7137160	7137720	We will see.
7138920	7139400	All right.
7140040	7140920	Pants off, pants off.
7140920	7142520	Who's saying I'm wearing them now?
7142520	7143020	All right.
7143800	7144760	Moving on.
7144760	7145320	Loki.
7145320	7147240	It's not so great news.
7147240	7150120	All too familiar news this year.
7150680	7152600	As we know, it's the end of the financial year.
7152600	7155320	So what's that mean when we're a successful company like
7155320	7156200	Electronic Arts?
7156200	7157240	Yes, layoffs.
7157240	7157880	That's right.
7157880	7161080	Because, you know, that's what they do.
7161080	7165800	So they generate approximately $7 billion in that revenue
7165800	7169320	last year, and now they've laid off 6% of its global
7169320	7171400	workforce, 7 to 800 people.
7172120	7177960	And while they drive greater focus across our portfolios,
7179480	7182120	they're moving away from projects that do not contribute
7182120	7186040	to their strategy, reviewing our real estate footprint
7186040	7187880	and restructuring some of our teams.
7189320	7193240	So yeah, cool.
7194920	7195560	But not really.
7195560	7199160	Not cool, but yeah, it's just not surprised.
7199160	7199560	Yeah.
7199560	7201400	And EA had a pretty good year, didn't they?
7202360	7202840	Yeah.
7202840	7203480	Seven.
7203480	7205800	I mean, I would think, you know, if you made $7 billion.
7206760	7210040	Look, I get the whole and we've gone down this road before
7210040	7212680	and about how layoffs are supposed to be about what's
7212680	7216280	coming and not what's already happened, but it's still not
7216280	7216840	a good look.
7216840	7221160	Like, and this all falls back to a theme we've talked about
7221160	7224120	many times on the show, and that is perception.
7225080	7227720	That's the truth, especially in the gaming industry for
7227720	7228600	a lot of people.
7228600	7231320	And when you have a great year and then you lay off 800
7231320	7235720	people at the end of that year, it's perceived a certain
7235720	7237080	way, whether it's true or not.
7237080	7238200	And it doesn't read great.
7238760	7239160	Yeah.
7239160	7241400	Perception versus intention.
7241400	7241900	Yep.
7243880	7244200	Yeah.
7244200	7244700	Yeah.
7245720	7250440	It should just be the law or something that if a company
7250440	7253880	loses the money, it comes out of the upper management pay.
7255080	7258840	Or that a certain percentage of cuts come from upper management
7258840	7261320	as well, but that'll never happen.
7261320	7266040	Sadly, Prince Peach Fuzz says layoffs or cut management
7266040	7267880	bonuses. Exactly.
7267880	7268520	That part.
7268520	7269080	Exactly.
7269960	7272680	Fixation Gay says, especially since they are making Sims
7272680	7274040	five, this sucks.
7274040	7277000	Yeah, there's still a lot of things EA still working on
7277000	7278440	that we expect will do fine.
7279400	7281720	Well, and on top of that, I mean, how much revenue are
7281720	7284440	they pulling from the 50,000 Sims 4?
7285320	7286920	Literally, literally.
7288760	7289400	All right.
7289400	7292040	I mean, there's a reason why I practically lived on the
7292040	7295160	Sims resource so I could get cool stuff.
7296760	7299320	Mike Deft says it very succinctly in our chat.
7299320	7300760	Unionize.
7301480	7301980	Yes.
7302520	7304120	Unionize game industry.
7304840	7306200	A few of you already have.
7306200	7307240	Learn from your peers.
7307320	7308280	That tide is coming.
7308280	7309160	That tide is coming.
7309880	7310600	All right.
7310600	7313640	Well, a game that I wish EA wishes they made, but unfortunately
7313640	7314120	they didn't.
7314120	7317720	It was publisher Rogue Games and developer Dabado Games is
7317720	7318600	releasing.
7318600	7321720	Hey, look, you know we love our rhythm games here on Orange
7321720	7322360	Lawns Radio.
7322360	7324680	We are rooted in rhythm game history.
7324680	7326200	Dark Soccer, Loki, myself.
7326200	7328120	We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution.
7328120	7331160	We'd love to play Para Para, BeatMania 2DX.
7331720	7334760	Hell, we were even on the news about Guitar Hero one time.
7334760	7336200	We love music games.
7336200	7337240	On my house.
7337240	7340520	And that's why we have to close the show tonight before we
7340520	7341160	get to your calls.
7341160	7345640	Anyway, talking about Hello Kitty and Friends Happiness
7345640	7346120	Parade.
7346680	7350040	It's coming out on the Switch, and it'll be out April 13th
7350040	7351400	for $19.99.
7351400	7354760	But 15% discount if you get it in the first week, because
7354760	7356520	that's when they want to sell it.
7356520	7358760	By the way, not just on the Switch and the eShop, but if
7358760	7359560	you want.
7359560	7363960	I'm sorry, this actually already launched for iOS and Android,
7363960	7366440	and it was also a Netflix exclusive thing.
7367880	7369880	My phone is my webcam, and I can't get it right now.
7370840	7373960	Launched in November, but now it's the Switch version that's
7373960	7374440	coming out.
7375000	7378760	If you want to know more about it, get ready for a fun and
7378760	7381640	unexpected journey through the world of Sanrio in a music
7381640	7383880	rhythm game like nothing you've experienced before.
7384600	7387720	Join Hello Kitty and two friends on a delightful music tour
7387720	7389880	as they spread happiness to everyone.
7389880	7392200	Along the way, they'll discover new friends to join their
7392200	7393400	musical parades.
7393400	7397240	However, jealous of Hello Kitty's growing fan base, Kuromi
7397240	7400520	will stop at nothing to end the music, dispatching goons and
7400520	7402680	laying traps to stop the momentum.
7402680	7405720	It's up to you to dance, dance, dance to the beat, avoid
7405720	7409160	traps, use each character's unique abilities, collect coins
7409160	7411400	and upgrades, complete challenges, and bring joy to the
7411400	7412680	world around you.
7412680	7416440	With a robust soundtrack filled with over 40 amazing pop
7416440	7416840	hits.
7418040	7420360	I wonder what those hits are, but they're probably Japanese
7420360	7420600	hits.
7420600	7422680	They all sound like they're in Japanese.
7422680	7425080	You'll be dancing to the music long after you put the
7425080	7426360	controllers down.
7426360	7428520	So it actually looks, it's interesting because it looks
7428520	7430520	like it might be like a little bit of like a runner kind
7430520	7431400	of game.
7431400	7434360	But like, I'm trying to, let me try to show this on the other
7434360	7435880	screen here as I'm doing this live.
7437320	7440760	Watching the trailer and it's very derivative, but the layout
7440760	7442200	is what's unique, I think.
7442200	7442700	Yeah.
7443720	7446600	So I'm trying to feel like how this kind of plays.
7446600	7449160	It's kind of hard to tell from the screenshots, but it kind
7449160	7451000	of looks like you're going down a track sort of thing.
7451880	7452600	Oh, hold on.
7453800	7456120	All I know is that you can play Bad Batsumaru, and that's
7456120	7457160	the most important part.
7457160	7458440	And he's huge.
7458440	7459080	He is.
7459080	7461080	That's as he needs to be.
7461080	7462360	Here's the character select screen.
7462360	7463080	There it is.
7463080	7464920	Because I know you all want to know what characters are in
7464920	7465000	it.
7465000	7465640	So there you go.
7467720	7468760	That may not be all of them.
7470120	7473480	Oh, you actually, you're on the, I found this elsewhere,
7473480	7476040	but no, that's just the same link we had.
7476040	7476600	Nevermind.
7476600	7476920	Sorry.
7476920	7478280	Was there a trailer embedded?
7478280	7479720	There's a trailer on the page.
7479720	7480840	Oh, there sure is.
7480840	7481960	From another source.
7481960	7484840	And apparently I think it was the same one.
7484840	7485000	Yeah.
7485000	7485480	Oh, okay.
7485480	7488440	So it kind of looks like you move around to the beat sort
7488440	7489000	of thing.
7489000	7489500	Okay.
7490840	7493240	Like an audio surf kind of thing or something like that.
7493240	7495160	Oh, you have to dance around the spike box.
7495160	7495480	Okay.
7495480	7497720	They show like this photo mode thing where I guess you get
7497720	7499720	like a special, it was on this one.
7499720	7500220	Yeah.
7501160	7502440	I thought pretty cool.
7502440	7502760	Okay.
7502760	7504840	So what's going on?
7504840	7507640	You have like a twisting path with people on either side of
7507640	7507800	it.
7507800	7510920	It has three segments on each path with coins on them.
7510920	7514440	And so I reckon that you have to be on the path to collect
7514440	7515960	the coins as it goes.
7515960	7521080	At different intervals, there is a, like a, I guess a checkpoint
7521080	7522440	line, like in a race.
7523000	7527080	And at that point, if you pass the photo shoot one, you get
7527080	7529320	like a special mode where it focuses in on your character
7529320	7532440	with lights and animations and whatnot.
7532440	7536280	So for people who are not watching.
7537080	7537480	Thank you.
7538520	7539080	Yes.
7539080	7539580	All right.
7542520	7543640	Comments in chat.
7543640	7546360	Mike Def says, so it's a runner rhythm game with Hello Kitty
7546360	7546840	and friends.
7546840	7547400	Sign me up.
7547400	7547640	Yeah.
7547640	7550200	Hey, 20 bucks or apparently Netflix.
7550200	7551800	It might be free on the phones.
7551800	7555880	So bonds 006 says I may just try that Hello Kitty game for
7555880	7556520	research.
7556520	7559320	Hey, look, all these years later, we still want to bring you
7559320	7560920	the latest and greatest in music gaming.
7560920	7561560	So there you go.
7562440	7563000	Hey, Rob.
7563000	7563480	What?
7563480	7565000	I just had a flash of memory.
7565000	7565500	Okay.
7565900	7570780	You and me in Burlingame at what was it called?
7570780	7571500	Network video.
7572620	7573500	Oh, Jesus.
7573500	7573740	Okay.
7573740	7574940	This would have been a long time ago.
7575500	7579660	And you bought a game that I found and passed on to you
7579660	7580780	called Kitty the cool.
7581580	7583100	Oh, my God.
7583100	7583340	Yeah.
7583340	7583580	Yeah.
7583580	7584300	Yeah.
7584300	7585740	And you know what I bought that day?
7586780	7587580	Vib ribbon.
7587580	7587980	Yeah.
7587980	7588940	I remember Vib ribbon.
7589980	7590300	Yep.
7590940	7591820	Oh, what a day.
7591820	7592460	Good times.
7593100	7593580	Yeah.
7593660	7596140	I just had a very vivid memory of it all of a sudden.
7596140	7596380	No.
7596380	7596780	All good.
7596780	7597260	I love it.
7597260	7597820	All right.
7597820	7599180	RIP network video.
7599180	7601420	We're going to get to some calls.
7601980	7605740	We invite your calls through our Discord server, vognetwork.com
7605740	7606380	slash discord.
7606380	7606700	You know what?
7606700	7608540	Even if you don't want to call, you just want to hang out
7608540	7609660	with us throughout the week.
7609660	7612460	We get a lot of stories that get posted the OLR channel.
7612460	7616460	You get to see me make fun of tweets and say a lot of things
7616460	7617180	throughout the week.
7617180	7620860	So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
7620860	7622700	We do have a call waiting in the green room.
7622700	7624540	If you want to call into the show, the green room is the
7624540	7627500	place to go because you can't actually see Archa through
7627500	7628940	the magical mystery of Discord.
7628940	7631660	You can't actually see our room where we're recording now,
7631660	7634540	but that for obvious Twitch related security purposes,
7634540	7635180	we don't.
7635180	7637900	We're not a wide open room, but we'll pull you in from the
7637900	7641260	green room if we see you in there, such as this caller,
7641260	7642380	who we've heard from before.
7642380	7644060	And I'm excited to welcome back.
7644060	7645820	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
7645820	7646220	Who's this?
7647500	7648460	This is ActDeft.
7648460	7649340	Hey, ActDeft.
7649340	7650860	It is great to hear from you.
7650860	7651500	What's up, buddy?
7652700	7658060	Well, do you want to write more about Niantic?
7659180	7660140	Do I have a choice?
7662060	7662540	We do.
7662540	7664620	But yeah, I want to talk about that.
7664620	7669260	I want to pretty much stay my opinion on that because,
7669260	7674060	you know, and everyone knows I'm an avid Pokemon Go player.
7674060	7675020	Yes, you are.
7675020	7680540	And yeah, I'm definitely not happy with how Niantic has handled
7680540	7686300	things in the past year, probably even.
7687260	7692300	But this is probably, yeah, one of the worst decisions they
7692300	7697740	have made because, and yeah, it's the remote raid thing.
7697740	7701900	It's like, I know that not many people that, okay, I'm going
7701900	7706620	to rave and I'm going to use those passes like a lot.
7707500	7711500	But at the same time, and I've seen it because I know people
7711500	7715980	that are disabled or have a condition and cannot go outside
7715980	7722060	like easily or have access to those places and they have
7722060	7724060	to rely on those remote raids.
7724780	7729180	So it actually makes me angry for them because Niantic knows
7729180	7730540	this. They know.
7731260	7735340	They have less than according to them.
7736140	7740620	And it's like baffling that they keep making these decisions
7740620	7745660	without considering what is happening to the player base.
7746620	7752300	And I've heard this from other podcasts, other people, that
7752300	7757740	they should be rewarding people that are going out and playing
7757740	7761900	incentivizing to go out instead of punishing players that
7762700	7765500	cannot go out, that cannot play outside.
7766220	7772300	I know that the thing you have to do in Pokemon Go is go out,
7772300	7775500	catch them all, play, meet people and all that.
7775500	7778140	And I understand that I actually enjoy that part of the
7778140	7782540	game, but at the same time, it's like not everyone can do it.
7782540	7784620	And we should have the option.
7784620	7793260	We should have more of, okay, like something like the incense
7794220	7798940	that also like costs a lot of outrage.
7800060	7803820	You know, during the pandemic, we had the one minute instance,
7803820	7807020	like every minute you had to spawn for one hour.
7807660	7809580	And okay, that was really great.
7809580	7810780	It was a good change.
7812540	7814300	And they change it back to five minutes.
7814620	7818620	If you're stationary, if you're walking, if you're moving
7818620	7823500	fast enough, you get the one minute spawn, but they could
7823500	7827100	have changed that like they did with the daily incense.
7827820	7831740	Like, okay, if you go out, if you're moving, if we see you're
7831740	7835820	moving, you get better spawns, you get legendaries, you get
7837340	7841020	like see the legendaries, you get more good stuff.
7841260	7844220	But if you're stationary, okay, you get the regular spawns,
7844220	7848380	you get normal stuff, you get normal like by going out.
7849340	7853180	But I also want to clarify, Deft, I agree with you totally
7853180	7854140	on what you're saying.
7854140	7857180	One thing that was interesting about that daily adventure
7857180	7860940	incense is that they, and again, it's a key problem with
7860940	7863980	with the whole messaging this time, that daily adventure
7863980	7868300	incense came out after the bad news announcement.
7868300	7870220	And it was one of those things where I was like, you know,
7870220	7872380	maybe if they'd said this when they've done the other that
7872380	7874460	they're going to give you a free 50 minute incense every
7874460	7877100	day, maybe it would have lessened the blow a little bit
7877100	7878860	and that and I feel like it's the mistake they're making
7878860	7879260	here.
7879260	7881180	But one other thing I want to say with the remote raids,
7881180	7882220	because I think this is important.
7882220	7883180	I didn't say it earlier.
7883820	7886700	I've always felt those remote raids were pretty bullshit.
7886700	7888140	And I'm going to tell you why.
7888140	7889580	And it's not what you think.
7890140	7894300	It's because you're not guaranteed to get that Pokemon.
7894300	7898140	So you're jacking up the price from 100 to 195.
7899020	7902300	And I'm not even guaranteed to get the Pokemon at the end
7902300	7902700	of the day.
7903340	7905180	I mean, what a joke.
7905180	7910300	At least the ones in person, you get a free pass every day.
7910300	7911580	So, okay, I use my pass.
7911580	7912620	I didn't get it today.
7912620	7914380	All right, whatever, whatever it worked out.
7914380	7916220	I would say from the get go.
7916940	7918780	And I think part of this kind of plays into some of the
7918780	7920460	things I was saying earlier that may not have been as
7920460	7920860	popular.
7920860	7924460	But from my perspective, the remote raids have never been
7924460	7928940	an equal playing field to what's going on out what's
7928940	7930060	happening in the real world.
7930060	7932380	It's bullshit that it's not a guaranteed chance if you're
7932380	7933500	going to spend that kind of money.
7933500	7935180	It's gambling.
7935180	7936780	It's mature rated in Australia.
7937900	7942940	And even then, it's like, okay, the good news they gave us
7942940	7945900	for going like in person raids.
7945900	7948140	Oh, you're going to get XL candy.
7948140	7949420	You're going to get more XL candy.
7949420	7950140	Yeah.
7950140	7953500	It's like, yeah, we already have the bonus active.
7953500	7957020	It's something that should be happening already.
7957020	7960780	Like, okay, if you're going to give us like those XL candies
7960780	7963580	that are really valuable in the game, okay, then make
7963580	7968780	probably, okay, more XP bonuses, more stardust bonuses,
7968780	7971980	give us more incentive to go out and play.
7972780	7976620	Because on the other hand, and I said this on Twitter, it's
7976620	7980060	like, I barely raid right now.
7980060	7983340	It's like, I barely do raids because I don't have the time
7983340	7984460	to do them.
7984460	7988140	It's like, if someone invites me, I'll probably do it.
7988140	7991340	And because it's something I really want, or I'm grinding
7991340	7993900	for a certain Pokemon.
7993900	7996940	But right now, it's like, why even bother?
7996940	7999340	Yeah, I stopped buying the passes.
7999340	8000700	So I feel bad when I get the invites.
8000700	8003020	I never go in, but I stopped buying the passes.
8003980	8007900	I only buy passes if I have the coins for it because I leave
8007900	8008940	my Pokemon in gyms.
8009580	8010460	Sure, that's it.
8010460	8010860	Sure.
8010860	8011340	And that's it.
8011340	8012780	I had to buy storage and stuff.
8013420	8015340	And I've been trying not to throw Niantic money.
8015340	8017980	So I've been just kind of in that game anyway.
8017980	8020060	I've just been stockpiling my gym coins.
8020060	8021260	Yeah, same thing, basically.
8021260	8023340	But I'm not really buying remote raid passes because I've
8023340	8024540	just had one too many raids.
8024540	8028220	It's interesting because the raids I'm okay with remote
8028220	8030860	raiding are the mega evolution ones, because you're always
8030860	8033740	guaranteed to get mega evolution juice, even if you don't
8033740	8034540	catch the Pokemon.
8035100	8037660	It's weird because I think the mega evolutions of Pokemon
8037660	8038380	Go are silly.
8038380	8040780	I don't really care for them, but it's actually the best
8040780	8043420	better rating mechanic are those mega evolution raids,
8043420	8045260	because you're always guaranteed at least something.
8046300	8050140	Yeah, at least there's something desirable outside of XP
8050140	8050860	and Stardust.
8050860	8052460	You know, people are going to say, well, you get those.
8053500	8054780	It's not the same and you know it.
8055820	8058460	Yeah, it's not the same, but at least there's something
8058460	8059660	always worth it.
8060220	8062780	Like, even with legendary raids and other raids, it's like,
8062780	8064860	okay, you get the chance for a shiny.
8064860	8068620	You get the chance for if you're living up, you want to
8068620	8069180	Stardust.
8069180	8072700	It's like, okay, you do them because, okay, it's fun sometimes.
8073580	8076860	But again, in this case, it's like, why even bother?
8076860	8080220	It's like, why should I even go out and raid?
8080220	8082300	Because there's no incentive to do so.
8082300	8082860	Right.
8082860	8087020	And even like with remote raiding, it's like, I mostly do it
8087020	8089020	because, oh, I'm helping someone else.
8089820	8095100	And even like today, I had the problem with a Pokemon
8095100	8099820	girlfriend that he needed people to beat out a Loye.
8099820	8100940	That's the legendary right now.
8101580	8105420	And we couldn't do the raid because there wasn't enough
8105420	8105740	people.
8106380	8112300	So right now, even like now, people are not even like
8112300	8116060	actively going out for raiding or doing raids in that way
8116060	8119900	because it's also kind of expensive, like buying every
8119900	8124140	single time, like a 100 coin pass.
8125340	8130380	It's like, even then, it's like, wow, it's dumb.
8130380	8134540	And it's one of the many dumb decisions Niantic has done
8134540	8137260	again in the past few years, in the last year, at least.
8137900	8140060	And this is where it's starting to get annoying is that
8140060	8142300	this is at least the third time, at least the third time
8142300	8144940	now they've made a major game decision that seems completely
8144940	8148140	tone deaf to the community and especially the ways they're
8148140	8148940	announcing it and everything.
8149820	8151420	It's hard to watch.
8151420	8154220	It's getting to be very hard to watch that they can be this
8156060	8161260	unwilling to change their ways and like not listen to advice
8161260	8161980	yet again.
8161980	8164860	But anyway, I think the remote raids were kind of busted
8164860	8167020	from the start, to be quite honest, but I get it.
8168540	8169980	And I'll keep playing.
8169980	8172620	I enjoy Pokemon Go for what it is.
8173340	8174860	I enjoy going out playing.
8175020	8179900	I have friends that have recently either come back to play
8180540	8181980	or are new to the game.
8182620	8186220	So it's like, oh, I have someone to play with.
8186220	8190700	At least if I go out, I can tell them and we can go there.
8190700	8191740	We can go to a park.
8191740	8193580	We can go to this or that.
8194140	8198300	So it's like that part is still fun, but it's part of what
8198300	8199340	the game already was.
8200460	8203660	So again, I'm not going to uninstall the game or anything.
8204460	8207660	People are saying that you should probably turn off
8207660	8211580	Adventure Sync because that's another way they're generating
8212620	8215180	or getting your info of location.
8215180	8215980	Interesting.
8216540	8219900	If you're like that extreme, it's like, oh, I'm not going
8219900	8223660	to uninstall the game, but I don't want to get Niantic any
8223660	8227820	money or any more money, turn off Adventure Sync.
8227820	8229900	You know what another thing it can do?
8230460	8232140	And I don't think I've seen a lot of people talking about
8232140	8233740	this, probably because nobody's doing it anyway.
8233740	8236140	But here, 100%, if you really want to get Niantic,
8236140	8238860	don't scan Poke Stops, period.
8239420	8242860	Do not, under any circumstance, for any reward, scan
8242860	8244060	Poke Stops.
8244060	8246380	That is the data they really want.
8246380	8248540	And that's where they're trying to push.
8248540	8251100	They even announced for Ingress 3D glyph hacking.
8251660	8252860	I think it was something they talked about
8252860	8253500	Stop by Southwest.
8253500	8255260	So we're going to start to see the features from that.
8255260	8257180	But in order for them to roll out those features, they
8257180	8259900	have to have the data around Poke Stops.
8259900	8264700	So that is honestly the number one thing you could do if
8264700	8266380	you really want to stick it to Niantic.
8266380	8269820	Do not, under any circumstance, scan Poke Stops.
8270860	8273580	Basically, don't give them any info they want.
8274780	8276940	That's the whole summary of it.
8276940	8278860	But yeah, I'm going to keep playing.
8278860	8281820	But yeah, I'm not going to invest any more money in the
8281820	8286220	game unless they make some changes in the future or as soon
8286220	8289340	as possible to make the game better for everyone.
8290220	8291100	I want to ask you one more thing.
8291100	8292620	We have a caller waiting, so I want to get to them too.
8292620	8294460	But one more quick question before I let you go.
8295180	8297260	What do you think of this whole latest kind of like
8297260	8301740	conspiracy theory, if you will, that Niantic never intended
8301740	8305980	to set the price at $195, because apparently it was
8305980	8308700	data mined some time ago that the price of remote passes
8308700	8309980	was going to be $150.
8310620	8313580	So Niantic, what they're doing here, and this is again,
8313580	8316700	nobody knows this for sure, but this is what some tinfoil
8316700	8319980	hat folks on social media and YouTube channels especially
8319980	8323820	are saying is that Niantic never intended, intends to go
8323820	8325100	to $195.
8325100	8327580	They're going to make it look like, oh, we're listening to
8327580	8329980	the community and so we're going to bring it back.
8329980	8334700	We're going to compromise and set it to $150 when it was
8334700	8336300	always intended to be $150.
8336300	8336700	Gotcha.
8338780	8343740	Um, I can't believe the conspiracy theory there, but at
8343820	8349100	the same time, since we have like, we have gotten leaks
8349100	8352620	from Pokemon Go in the sense that they haven't released
8352620	8353180	something yet.
8353180	8359020	And I can speak like in terms of Scarlet and Violet, we
8359020	8361900	learned about Gimmigo before the game even launched.
8361900	8362780	True.
8362780	8366060	So it's like, maybe it's something, okay, they are listening
8366060	8368300	and they're going to revert, but they haven't gone into,
8369020	8371020	to, okay, we're going to make this change this way.
8371740	8374620	But at the same time, and this is something I also want
8374620	8380140	to say on record, that the price increase for me isn't
8380140	8381020	the deal breaker.
8382060	8383900	They could have increased the price, whatever.
8384940	8388300	It's the thing that they're limiting the rates for only
8388300	8388860	five a day.
8391020	8394620	That's the thing that's getting to me that it's like,
8394620	8395420	why are you limited?
8396140	8399420	Like, it's like, again, not all people that are remote
8399420	8403820	rating are going to spend like, oh, I'm going to buy 10
8403820	8406220	passes or I'm going to buy 20.
8406220	8409500	Most people that do that are probably most of the people
8409500	8411340	that are going to go out and rate it anyways.
8412140	8416140	And I know them because I watch also those Poketubers too.
8416860	8418620	And I know people that do that.
8418620	8420700	It's like, yeah, they're going to do it anyway.
8420700	8421980	They're going to buy the passes.
8422860	8425980	It's the thing that they're limiting to people that are
8425980	8428140	probably, again, that cannot probably go out.
8428780	8429500	They cannot move.
8429500	8433900	They cannot access certain places that it's like, why?
8434540	8435260	Why limit that?
8435260	8438860	Why nerf the passes in that way?
8438860	8440780	Yeah, it does seem odd.
8441580	8444300	I don't know anyone that rates that much remotely anyway,
8444300	8447340	but I'm sure they must have the data for it, I guess.
8447340	8448220	But anyway.
8448220	8450380	All right, I'm going to let you go, my friend.
8450380	8451660	Thank you so much for the phone call.
8451660	8454380	And we'll see what kind of meetings happen this weekend
8454380	8457980	when Niantic says tomorrow and maybe Tuesday.
8457980	8458780	So we'll see.
8458780	8459100	Yeah.
8459100	8459340	All right.
8459340	8460540	Take care, my friend.
8460540	8461420	Hey, thanks for having me.
8461420	8462060	Thank you.
8462060	8462460	Take care.
8462460	8462860	Bye bye.
8463740	8463980	All right.
8463980	8466940	We're going to hop on actually to one more quick call here.
8466940	8469980	Let me just change the cameras around live and let's welcome
8469980	8471020	another caller.
8471020	8472620	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
8472620	8473020	Who's this?
8474140	8475900	Hi, my name is Fixation Gaze.
8475900	8476300	Hello.
8476300	8477340	Well, I remember you.
8477340	8479580	You were here last week, but it's great to hear from you.
8479580	8480140	How are you?
8481180	8482540	Oh, I'm great.
8482540	8486860	I just was I because you were talking about EA and Sims was
8486860	8489020	one of my hyper fixations like Resident Evil.
8489020	8491900	You uncracked my autistic Uber potential.
8491900	8494860	And now I'm here to rant about how mad I am at EA about Sims.
8494860	8496140	Well, please let's talk.
8496140	8499660	Let's talk about how mad you are at EA.
8499660	8501500	That was one of my fixations, too.
8501500	8503180	So yeah, I feel you.
8503180	8504780	I spent last summer.
8504780	8509500	I think I have over 2000 hours in Sims 4 on its own.
8509500	8510140	Oh, my gosh.
8510140	8511260	I was a Sims kid, too.
8511260	8514380	I spent years on that stupid game.
8514380	8516140	But I wanted to say, fun fact.
8516140	8518940	Do you know how much it costs to get every single add on for
8518940	8519500	the Sims?
8521500	8522780	Bob Parker number.
8522780	8523820	1500.
8523820	8524780	I'd go higher.
8525340	8526940	I'll say 4300.
8528300	8529820	You both actually were incorrect.
8529820	8530860	It is much lower than that.
8530860	8534060	It is currently $995.
8534700	8535340	That's cheap.
8535340	8536220	Gwen, I'm closer.
8537900	8539820	What price is right rules we both lost.
8539820	8543900	But going back to what Gwen was saying about mortgage payments,
8543900	8545900	that's two thirds of mine.
8546540	8547100	Yeah.
8547100	8551180	But to be fair, that doesn't sound a lot for, like, if you
8551180	8554620	think about loot boxes and whatnot and buying add ons.
8554620	8559180	But that in totals to 61 add ons for the game.
8559180	8559980	61.
8560620	8562540	Instead of updating your game.
8562540	8566220	Instead, every single one of those add ons is some sort of
8566220	8567180	just penny pinching.
8567180	8569260	Like, oh, we made this functional.
8569260	8570140	Buy it.
8570140	8573260	Which is actually one of the game packs because they have
8573260	8573980	four different packs.
8573980	8575100	They have expansions.
8575100	8575980	They have game packs.
8576860	8577580	And they have kits.
8578460	8582220	So again, instead of balling them up into here's expansion
8582220	8585660	pack one, two, three, and four, they have different gimmicks.
8585660	8588540	Like, one of them in the game packs, which runs for about
8588540	8592700	$20, actually makes weddings into a functional event that
8592700	8594140	should have been base game.
8595020	8598780	But instead it's packaged into a here's a little cool thing
8598780	8601980	that we did because let's be honest, Sims 4 is a great game
8601980	8602860	base game.
8602860	8603420	It's cute.
8603420	8604300	You can play with it.
8604300	8605100	It's functional.
8605660	8608460	But it's barely functional to the point of a realistic
8608460	8610620	simulation of relationships.
8610620	8612060	It is barely functional.
8612060	8615980	People had to model this stuff in before EA did their thing.
8615980	8619100	Yeah, it completely like you had to have add ons.
8619100	8622060	You had to have mods in order to make it a fun game.
8622060	8625020	It was functional for what it was, but they should have
8625020	8628380	continued to add on to things like weddings or events or
8628380	8629500	things like that.
8629500	8632300	But instead they broke it down into different things with
8632300	8635820	expansions, which are like the newer, like Island Living,
8635820	8639580	City Life, stuff like that running about $39.99 or $40 if
8639580	8640860	you just want to lump it.
8640860	8644700	And then they have game packs, which are like expansions,
8644700	8647260	but they're for, like, one certain thing, like the wedding
8647260	8651260	expansion pack, which was about $19 or running you $20.
8651260	8654860	So if you want to fix one, yeah, it's a patch.
8654860	8658540	You're paying $20 for a patch, and then you have stuff packs,
8658540	8661260	which, like, they have a clutter pack, they have a bathroom
8661260	8662940	pack, they have an infant pack.
8663740	8664700	That's all like $10.
8665660	8668140	And then you have things like kits that are like one or two
8668140	8670460	different items that you can buy for $5.
8671580	8674300	It is very interesting to see that business model next to
8674300	8678060	something like No Man's Sky, which does these regular
8678060	8679100	expansion type stuff.
8679100	8680860	And they give it away as part of the base game.
8680860	8683580	Now, granted, the trajectory of those two games has been
8683580	8684220	very different.
8684220	8687020	So I understand EA can charge it for The Sims in a way that
8687020	8688860	No Man's Sky has to more prove itself.
8689820	8691660	But it's just interesting.
8692380	8695260	I just find it completely fascinating that instead of making
8695260	8697820	a new game, like they're doing that now, of course, like
8697820	8699660	they release that they're going to be doing Sims 5.
8699660	8702220	But instead of making a new game or going back and doing
8702220	8706140	free patches for the community, EA went, hold on, I smell
8706140	8708700	money. And they've done something that no one has ever
8708700	8711820	been able to recreate in form of, like, loot boxes, because
8711820	8715820	in loot boxes, the fun is like, oh, my God, I can, like,
8715820	8717420	there's a gambling aspect.
8717420	8719740	There's an addiction to loot boxes.
8719740	8721580	But to Sims stuff, they have it.
8721580	8723740	So it's like, instead of because they could shove a bunch
8723740	8725500	of this into an expansion pack for like $60.
8726620	8729420	They could do it with the original ones when they're all
8729420	8729920	on disk.
8730460	8731100	Yeah.
8731100	8734540	But nowadays they go, oh, it's just $5 for an extra kit.
8734540	8736540	It's just $20 for an extra pack.
8736540	8739820	It's like, it's not a lot of money, quote unquote.
8739820	8742460	So it gets you with the like, oh, yeah, I could just blow
8742460	8745740	that. But then if you buy everything that's close to $1,000.
8746380	8749420	Now you're giving it $20 a month for how many years?
8749420	8751340	And that's how they get you.
8751340	8754460	And then to add insult to all of this, at the end of all
8754460	8758300	that, after Sims 5 comes out, you know there's going to be
8758300	8761980	a Sims 4 Ultimate Edition that they release all over again
8761980	8762780	for $70.
8762780	8764220	That is the whole enchilada.
8764220	8766300	It's the whole $990, whatever.
8766300	8767580	We already got that.
8767580	8768300	Oh, really?
8770700	8773100	But we already got some sort of controversy like that.
8773100	8776380	See, last year, the reason why I got back into the Sims
8776380	8779420	again is they released the base game for free.
8779420	8780700	Oh, that's right.
8780700	8781820	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8781820	8785100	And it's going to be for free for the rest of the shelf life.
8785100	8787740	You will never have to pay $60 for the base game again.
8788540	8790860	But what about for everybody who bought the game?
8791820	8795180	Well, EA had an answer for them.
8795180	8799260	See, they gave them a voucher for one free $5 kit.
8799260	8806460	So paying $60 for the wonderful game.
8806460	8808460	Here's a $5 coupon.
8808460	8809740	Go pick out something you like.
8809740	8810540	Here's a dollar.
8810540	8811580	Go see a Star War.
8812300	8814380	Not a single depreciation value.
8814380	8817820	But still, how long did it stay a $60 game?
8818380	8818700	Right.
8819740	8822540	Because it's no longer like a $60 game.
8822540	8824860	Now it's basically a free to play.
8824860	8826780	Like Sims Multi.
8826780	8828540	Have you ever played the Sims Mobile game?
8828540	8830060	The Sims 4 Mobile game?
8830060	8831100	We did for a hot minute.
8832060	8835660	It is practically unplayable without any of the add on purchases.
8837820	8843580	It is pretty much like you cannot play Sims Mobile without any add ons because of that's
8843580	8844620	how it's built.
8844620	8849260	So basically, they just turned Sims Mobile into what they want the Sims to be, where
8849260	8853020	you can play to a certain extent before you're like, Oh, well, this is getting kind of bored
8853020	8853980	monotonous.
8853980	8855180	Let me buy this pack.
8855180	8855980	Let me buy this.
8855980	8857100	Let me buy that.
8857100	8858620	It's just five dollars.
8858620	8859900	It's just, it's just.
8860540	8866540	Well, and on top of that, there's other modders that are doing stuff a lot better than EA
8866540	8867040	did.
8867660	8869900	The Maxis art was cute for a minute.
8871340	8871900	And no.
8872460	8876060	I want to get on the community a little bit about it.
8876060	8878620	Like the Sims resource, which is one like reputable.
8878620	8879660	You can go there all the time.
8880300	8883420	They're now doing like memberships to get out of ads and whatnot.
8883420	8888220	So it's all becoming like the Sims is becoming kind of like a luxury sort of ordeal where
8888220	8891260	you can kind of pay to be part of a certain community.
8891260	8894940	And I just might pay for them because it was three bucks a month, but still.
8895500	8899820	Yeah, but still like that's three bucks a month on top of all the other things that
8899820	8903340	you're if you're like doing Sims content, because I know a lot of people are doing just
8903340	8904220	Sims content.
8904860	8909260	You know, call me call me old school, but I would I would love to get a new Sims City
8909340	8909580	game.
8909580	8913980	And I know there was that reboot a few years ago that again, it had the always online thing.
8913980	8915260	It didn't land well at all.
8916060	8918060	But I'd love to see that concept revisited.
8918060	8919020	I love Sim City.
8919820	8926220	I think with how EA is doing things and how they are very much on the board of let's get
8926220	8928220	a bunch of money for one thing.
8928220	8935340	I know they're probably going to milk Sims 5 just like this, except the base pack for
8935340	8936460	Sims 5.
8936460	8943420	Or you can buy the deluxe pack that comes with 10 game packs of your choosing or one
8943420	8945980	expansion because it will even give you less than that.
8946620	8951820	Yeah, no, what they do on EA actually right now is you can bundle them and pick one game
8951820	8956940	pass, one expansion, one stuff, one kit, and then you get it for like 5% cheaper, it feels
8956940	8958220	like because it's not a lot.
8960380	8963020	The reason why they keep doing is because they can get away with it.
8963020	8964860	Oh yeah, and they get so much money out of it.
8964860	8971660	Because again, if you have everything for the Sims, it is a very easily, without any
8971660	8975420	mods at all, you can turn it into an entire empire of content.
8976540	8978860	Especially if you use cheat codes.
8978860	8982780	If you can move things around and clutter and do all the pretty aesthetic stuff, you
8982780	8985420	can just make a lot of content just from doing that.
8985420	8988380	You don't even need mods, mods make it better.
8988380	8990620	They just motherload it and you're set.
8991260	8998300	I have been playing around with the up and down motions where you can raise and lower
8998300	9000780	objects and it is a game changer.
9001660	9007260	If you can abuse the basement settings so that you can make things not on the same layer
9007260	9010700	but you can use them on the same layer or lower objects so you can hide them inside
9010700	9011740	of better looking objects.
9011740	9012860	It is fascinating.
9012860	9017980	I learned how to make spiral staircases and split level houses all from manipulating the
9017980	9018620	game engine.
9019580	9023020	Yeah, that was my jam.
9023020	9025100	I kind of want to learn more things every day.
9025100	9026540	I love Sims 4, I really do.
9026540	9030940	EA hit the nail on the head with that kind of concept and people can't really replicate
9030940	9033020	it without making the Sims.
9033740	9038380	But EA is absolutely disgusting in how they've been treating their content packs.
9039500	9042140	And with all that money they're making, they go and they lay off workers.
9042140	9042860	Boy oh boy.
9043660	9049020	I will say I am very happy with them for their LGBTQ content that they've released for free.
9049660	9055580	From what I looked over, the binder packs, the scar packs that they have for it, they
9055580	9057420	are actually really good.
9057420	9062620	They have figure slimming things that you can get, which are gender affirming for trans
9062620	9063020	women.
9063020	9068140	They have binders, they have top surgery scars, the different kinds.
9068140	9070220	All that stuff has honestly looked really good.
9070220	9073740	Yeah, to EA's credit, they tend to be ahead of the curve.
9073740	9076940	I remember they were at the early gamer X conventions before a lot of companies are
9076940	9079820	getting on board and stuff, and they've always been a little bit ahead of the curve on that
9079820	9079980	stuff.
9079980	9081500	So credit where credit is due.
9082460	9087100	The way that they handled trans characters, just to begin with, that you picked.
9087100	9091020	Yeah, you could pick physical body, but you could pick different voice and you could pick
9091020	9091260	different.
9091820	9093340	They handled it really well.
9093340	9095020	Remember SimCopter.
9095020	9098540	It goes all the way back to SimCopter and some of the things that they put in those
9098540	9099020	games.
9099020	9103740	So anyway, currently you can actually pick your own pronouns, like your Sims pronouns,
9103740	9105340	and you can do custom pronouns.
9105900	9106700	That's awesome.
9106700	9108780	So you can make that up.
9108780	9113260	And also, although I will say that it took that update for them to also add medical equipment
9113260	9114620	for disabled folks.
9114620	9120380	We don't have the wheelchair yet, but you can have an insulin pump and a cochlear ear
9120380	9121660	implant for your Sim.
9121660	9122140	That's cool.
9123100	9123580	All right.
9123580	9127340	Well, Fixie, I got to let you go to try to squeeze in one more call before we get to
9127340	9128060	Dead by Daylight.
9128060	9130140	But thank you so much for calling in.
9130140	9136460	I hope everything goes swimmingly with your own channel and all that.
9136460	9138700	And if folks aren't following you, I hope they will.
9139820	9140220	Of course.
9140220	9141420	Thank you for having me so much.
9141420	9145340	I love listening in and I love adding feedback, so I will bow out now.
9145340	9146060	Thank you for having me here.
9146060	9146460	Take care.
9146460	9148140	You're a welcome part of our community.
9149260	9149500	All right.
9149500	9150380	Take care, friend.
9150380	9151740	Oh, there they went.
9151740	9153100	Okay, one more call.
9153100	9154940	We're going to squeeze in here before we wrap it up for tonight.
9154940	9155980	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9155980	9156380	Who's this?
9157580	9159020	So one and only Rama.
9159020	9160300	How is everybody doing tonight?
9160300	9161580	I am doing fantastic.
9161580	9164060	I don't know why you're coming through quiet, but I'll fix that in a minute.
9164060	9164700	How are you, Rama?
9165340	9165740	I'm good.
9165740	9166380	Hold on.
9166380	9173820	I got a new microphone stand and I've been adjusting it so that people can hear me.
9173820	9178220	So if I'm coming off too low, that means I need to move the mic closer to myself.
9178220	9179180	I apologize.
9179180	9179660	You're fine.
9179660	9180940	I can always boost you in Discord.
9180940	9182220	You're not that quiet.
9182220	9184700	Just maybe reading a little quieter than the three of us.
9185420	9186620	But what's on your mind tonight, my friend?
9187820	9189340	Things now.
9189340	9189740	Great.
9189740	9193900	I'm not on because I don't want to hit the wrong button and get booted from the chat.
9193900	9195580	So I'm just going to leave it as is.
9195580	9200300	So there's originally three things I wanted to talk about, but due to time constraints,
9200300	9201820	I'll cut it down to two.
9201820	9202380	All right.
9202380	9204700	Number one, tick tock.
9205500	9211900	Now, in my field of work, it's understandable for the employees who have it on their personal
9211900	9213020	phones and so forth.
9213020	9219100	And I can say this, given the nature of my work, if we handed out company phones, that
9219100	9222780	will be an OK application to have.
9222780	9229900	Now, granted, we've had discussions in the chat about data mining and so forth, about
9229900	9232300	Facebook getting caught out there and so forth.
9232860	9239340	Now, I have not been following my IT papers as much as I normally would have.
9240300	9246780	But going back a couple of years around a certain time or certain somebody was hating
9246780	9252060	on tick tock, even before that, I.T.
9252060	9259260	people in higher standing network engineers, people from various companies and entities
9259260	9263020	were saying that tick tock should not be on your phone.
9263020	9269180	And it's more of the aspect of the permissions that the app is has and is pulling more
9269260	9271820	information than it should.
9271820	9273580	Is it different from Facebook, though?
9274940	9281340	I would say, all right, from a personal point of view, there is no difference from a technical
9281340	9284860	point of view, from the data that they're pulling, give or take.
9284860	9290860	I think it's more like even though the app has the permissions to grab certain data,
9290860	9293100	it's how it's pulling the data.
9293100	9296700	Again, it's been a few years since I've been reading papers on this.
9296700	9298060	But what's interesting is.
9299260	9300460	They were I.T.
9300460	9305660	people who were saying that, you know, you should not have to talk on your phone.
9305660	9312460	And then when a certain somebody got butthurt about being teased on tick tock, that's when
9312460	9315100	it came in as a center of attraction.
9315100	9319420	But what's funny is people were wanting to ban it because of a certain somebody getting
9319420	9325660	offended, not because of the additional data that it is not supposed to have.
9326380	9328220	Which is kind of crazy to me.
9328220	9331500	Well, and the real reason people want to ban it is because of the China connection.
9331500	9333020	Let's just call it what it is like.
9333020	9334060	It's that's what it is.
9334060	9336700	That's why it's being treated differently than other social media applications.
9337420	9344300	Well, I will say I'm not on TikTok, but I have friends, cosplayers, content creators
9344300	9345500	that are on there.
9345500	9347980	I can tell you that it seems that TikTok.
9347980	9359500	Plays to certain colors, genders and so forth, because I have been told, you know, if you
9359500	9364780	are LGBT, expect yourself on TikTok to be a little bit lower than everybody else.
9364780	9369260	And they have been called out for and they've been caught red handed for this numerous times.
9370220	9372700	The algorithm is an interesting thing on TikTok.
9372700	9377500	I would just say my experience is that with very minimal effort, I've been exposed to
9377580	9382380	a lot more people than probably even on Twitch or some other platforms.
9382380	9385260	And I've made two short videos on TikTok.
9385260	9389100	It's not something I'm super invested in as a platform, but that algorithm has definitely
9389100	9389980	caught my attention.
9391900	9397020	I'm not well researched enough on some of the comments about LGBT suppression and things
9397020	9400620	of that nature to comment any further on that.
9400620	9402380	I can just speak to the experience I've had so far.
9403580	9404060	And you're right.
9404060	9410060	And I will say I know people whose engagement on TikTok is much higher than it has been
9410060	9414860	on Twitter, Instagram and everywhere else.
9414860	9419180	But, you know, again, I am not on there because I am not that creative.
9419180	9421180	I will watch other people's TikToks.
9421180	9426380	I don't think people need to see a TikTok of me screaming at my computer while I'm editing
9426380	9432300	over 3000 cosplay videos while holding a bottle, an unmarked bottle of hooch in my hand.
9432300	9432800	Okay.
9433660	9433980	All right.
9433980	9435660	Quickly, what was the other thing you want to talk about tonight?
9438940	9442940	You know, I think I might have now three.
9442940	9443580	Oh, sure.
9445820	9452700	We don't need E3, but in the aspect of we need E3 elaborate.
9453420	9453820	Okay.
9453820	9460060	So I was traveling yesterday and one of my group chats, people were talking about E3,
9460060	9462060	how E3 is useless.
9462060	9465900	We don't need E3 because we have packs and this and that.
9465900	9469820	I had to stop what I was doing to kind of educate people.
9469820	9475500	Now, if I am wrong about E3, please correct me because y'all are the gurus.
9476940	9478540	I think I know what you're going to say.
9478540	9480540	So please say it, because, yes, I will.
9480540	9485340	I will course correct if I if it's not what I think you're going to say.
9485900	9486460	Thank you.
9486460	9493580	I said to the fellows, people in the chat, E3 is not PAX.
9493580	9499980	PAX was kind of created to give the smaller independent publishers and people a voice
9499980	9501820	that he did not have it.
9501820	9507420	E3 is industrial trade show.
9507420	9510940	People in the industry go to E3.
9510940	9511740	Correct.
9511740	9512540	Yes, you are right.
9513180	9515820	E3 is not for the public.
9516380	9522220	What you see at PAX, you would see a beta revision at E3.
9522220	9523900	There is a difference.
9523900	9532620	You let the general person go to E3 and they're playing a beta of so and so game part five.
9533340	9538140	That average person is going to go on their socials and bitch about how terrible the game
9538140	9543260	is compared to somebody within the industry, whether they're a developer, a creator or
9543260	9545180	journalist would explain.
9545180	9547180	This is how it looks at this point.
9547180	9549420	This is what we're looking forward to towards the end.
9549420	9549740	Right.
9549740	9555100	And the short way of saying that to your friend is quite simply and succinctly this.
9555100	9557820	E3 isn't for you, period.
9557820	9559020	That's what it is.
9559020	9565420	And yeah, and everything you're saying about people would not be able to put their critical
9565420	9566700	eye aside.
9566700	9571420	And this is why Square Enix, and I remember this when they were showing off, I think I
9571420	9577020	played Final Fantasy 13 at E3 and I wanted to get pictures of it, but they would not
9577020	9578780	even let you take pictures of the screen.
9578780	9582460	Even though they had a demo out there, they did not want people taking pictures of it
9582460	9583820	because it wasn't the final product.
9583820	9585740	They didn't want people publishing pictures of that.
9586700	9589500	That was an early peak is what it was.
9589500	9594940	And those were some of the signs that showed that E3 was becoming this other monster
9595420	9596940	that it wasn't really ever supposed to be.
9598940	9604140	So another thing with E3 said, we're going to let the general public in.
9604940	9610940	Do you know how many cosplayers got excited about going to another con to party and have
9610940	9611980	a good time?
9611980	9619260	I'm just sitting there drinking my tea going, you're going to have a bad time.
9619260	9620860	And they're like, why?
9620860	9626060	I'm just like, you do realize this is not a three day weekend thing.
9627020	9631420	Everything ends around five thirty six o'clock.
9632700	9635740	And that's why I say E3 died that year.
9636700	9641100	And we've just been running around its corpse like weekend at Bernie's, especially, you
9641100	9643180	know, what did I say on Twitter?
9643260	9649660	Something like E3 died in twenty seventeen, twenty nineteen and the excuse me, twenty
9649660	9654220	twenty in the pandemic and everything killed what was already a corpse, basically.
9654220	9656700	And now we've been trying to run it around like weekend at Bernie's.
9656700	9658300	And it's just not happening.
9659100	9660380	And let's be real.
9661020	9662460	Let's be real here.
9662460	9665340	Rob, let's not let's not pull any shit right here.
9665340	9672060	I don't know about you, but again, when I heard that RePop got their hands on E3, I
9672140	9675100	knew it was over right then and there.
9676380	9680300	It's that scene from The Simpsons where you say, stop, stop.
9680300	9681660	You're killing him already.
9681660	9687900	Yeah, I was the same scene with RePop, their hands on it because they were going to turn
9687900	9689420	that into another pax.
9689420	9691820	And I will testify on that.
9691820	9693740	And can I get an amen?
9693740	9695740	Well, I hope your audio is coming through now.
9695740	9700860	Here's the thing that for me, that when that whole thing went down, that was just more
9700940	9703820	like, so this is just further proof.
9703820	9707020	The E3 you used to know no longer exists.
9709580	9711180	Go back and check the tapes.
9711180	9713500	I know that's what I said back then.
9713500	9716300	This is already proof that E3 is a different show now.
9716300	9718540	It's not the same show you remember from 2006.
9719260	9724380	I think also RePop realized, oh, we can't make any money on losses.
9724380	9725740	Let's move on.
9725740	9729740	Because I think we're kind of at a point where we don't need E3.
9729740	9732300	But again, we need something.
9732300	9738140	I mean, I don't think the gamers realize how lucky and spoiled they are.
9738140	9745260	All of these YouTube reels and live streams this and live streams that 20 years ago.
9745260	9747820	Where were we getting our information from?
9747820	9751660	The July issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly or GamePro?
9751660	9758060	The industry now has Game Developers Conference, and they're very smart to just not invite
9758060	9760780	the media to that or in very limited capacity.
9761820	9766060	Because this has already happened where people have tried to treat the Game Developers Conference
9766060	9767420	as if it was E3.
9767420	9769180	They left sorely disappointed.
9769180	9777180	And somehow Game Developers Conference for at least the last probably since 2015, 2014
9777180	9782220	has managed to exist kind of as an industry game developers event that people don't like
9782220	9786140	the consumer and the average gamer, whatever, don't put a lot of stock in.
9786140	9787900	And so that's good.
9787900	9791580	That's where game developers want their trade show to be.
9791580	9794940	So don't let's not spread the word.
9794940	9802780	The Game Developers Conference is the new E3, but it's a secret to everyone.
9803900	9804780	It's like this.
9804780	9806220	The best way I can say it is like this.
9807020	9810620	GDC is the science of gaming.
9811900	9815900	E3 is where the science becomes magic.
9815900	9817340	I see some awesome stuff.
9818300	9823500	It might do the magic black smoke and they may close the curtain, but you ain't got to
9823500	9829500	worry about it because there is an awesome nerd back there typing away and getting it
9829500	9832220	done so that you have an awesome game for Christmas.
9832220	9833180	I have a small correction.
9833180	9837660	I would say GDC is the science of the industry and all those great things you said.
9838300	9840860	E3 is dead.
9843100	9845660	That's that's pour it out.
9845660	9847820	All right, Rama, I got to let you go so we can wrap up.
9847820	9849420	Thank you so much, my friend, for the call.
9849420	9852220	I hope everybody will check out Anime Jam Session.
9852220	9857980	Lots of great coverage on shows that are for fans, actually, over there on Anime Jam Session.
9858780	9861820	Rob, I am offended that you said pour one out.
9861820	9865180	I wouldn't pour out a can of Bud Light for E3.
9867900	9868400	Ew.
9871660	9872220	Point taken.
9873260	9874380	Point taken.
9874380	9875660	All right, Rama, take care, my friend.
9876300	9877580	All right, later, y'all.
9877580	9878080	Bye.
9879020	9879740	Oh, my God.
9879740	9880540	All right.
9880540	9881980	That is going to do it for another episode.
9881980	9885100	I might have turned up in my mouth a little bit at the mention of Bud Light.
9885100	9885420	I know.
9885420	9886380	I don't blame you.
9886380	9888380	Quickly, quickly, Loki, any last minute stories?
9889100	9890540	Yeah, I did have one.
9890540	9896460	There is a special offer going on right now through Square Enix where you can download
9897260	9900460	Stormblood for free for Final Fantasy 14.
9901100	9902940	That promotion doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
9902940	9904700	Why not just make it free free?
9904700	9905900	It's it's weird.
9905900	9908060	It's free until May 28th.
9908060	9910140	So if you're interested, go do it.
9910780	9914300	But yeah, it's considering getting back into 14.
9914300	9917580	But I don't really have any people who play at the time.
9917580	9918080	I would.
9919340	9921340	I kind of want to get back into Star Trek online.
9922380	9923980	Oh, that's a blast to the past.
9923980	9925340	I love that game so much.
9925340	9929260	Just all I did was run around in Deep Space Nine and hang out with Morn.
9931180	9931680	All right.
9932300	9935100	Well, with that, we're going to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.
9935100	9937660	Thank you so much for downloading and checking out Orange Launch Radio.
9937660	9938540	We appreciate you all.
9939340	9941020	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9941020	9942860	Help us add more voices to the pool.
9943420	9946220	Join us live here on Sunday nights over at VOG Network.
9946220	9948780	Or if you want, you can also listen to us on the podcast.
9948780	9953180	Of course, a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is that
9953180	9955260	you found this show goes an awful long way.
9956300	9957500	We really appreciate all of that.
9957500	9962220	Tell a friend, tell an enemy, just tell somebody because actually the show we have been getting
9962780	9965340	a few more new faces here lately, which has been nice.
9965340	9967020	We want more, more.
9967020	9968380	So help us.
9968380	9969660	We would really appreciate that.
9970780	9972620	Let's go give folks final thought.
9972620	9974940	Dark Sakura, I know you're off to go do Dead by Daylight.
9974940	9976380	Do you have a final thought for us tonight?
9977500	9984140	Yes, I'm having a subathon on April 19th, and really, it's more of just an excuse to
9984140	9989180	have people hang out with me on my birthday who I can't see in person, but it will be
9990220	9990780	on my channel.
9990780	9991900	I'm playing Dead by Daylight.
9992140	9997580	Having a midnight suns and cold to the lamb palate cleanser, but I'm planning on going
9997580	10000700	at minimum 18 hours and I'm going to aim for 24.
10001820	10004620	There will be appearances by Midna and artwork giveaways.
10005500	10006000	All right.
10007100	10007580	Oh boy.
10007580	10007740	All right.
10007740	10014540	So in the meantime, I'm going to play DVD now.
10014540	10014940	Bye.
10014940	10015180	All right.
10015180	10015580	Have fun.
10017100	10017580	All right.
10017580	10019340	Loki, we'll go to you and your final thought tonight.
10020060	10026140	I'm just trying to get my content creation down to less than a month between episodes
10026140	10026940	of things.
10026940	10028220	So good call.
10029820	10032860	It helps to be able to get more videos out and spreading the word.
10032860	10033500	That's for sure.
10033500	10034060	Yes.
10034060	10037740	So that's why starting yet another series is a great idea.
10037740	10038460	Yeah, good call.
10039980	10041260	My final thought tonight.
10041260	10042380	I don't have a lot.
10042380	10045180	My life outside of the show has been pretty busy.
10045980	10047260	Can't talk about that right now.
10047260	10048780	I'll talk about it in a week or two.
10048780	10050380	It's nothing to do with OLR gaming.
10050380	10051740	It's just interesting stuff.
10051740	10055900	So I'll talk about that in a couple of weeks, but otherwise, that's it.
10055900	10058300	I hope everybody is doing well and great.
10059020	10062140	Looking forward to getting back to some conventions, things like Dragon Con.
10062140	10066540	Looking forward to hoping to meet some people over Labor Day and check out some events here
10066540	10067260	locally, too.
10067260	10071660	I think we're supposed to go to one in mid April, so I'm supposed to more info on that
