9716	16702	Fortnite is back on top of the Twitch stream directory, as Epic Games brought back the original map and other original release assets.
16702	27871	Epic has now followed in the footsteps of Blizzards, Warcraft 3, Diablo 2, World of Warcraft, and StarCraft, also most of Nintendo's first-party library, and flagship titles that released around the transition of two of their consoles, and a star is born.
27871	34156	Everything old is new again, now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Sommers, and Loki, to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news.
34156	36238	Starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice,
38601	55523	hello my friends out there on the internet welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice it is orange lounge radio and we are live once again with episode number 980 of our show for tonight november the 5th of 2023
57165	77317	I am Rob Roberts, here with you every week as we tape live at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, which if you forgot Daylight Savings, or the end of it, I guess, was last night, then you already heard Bobby's show, because you would have tuned in just in time for that.
77717	78619	DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers
91792	92573	Hi.
92573	102484	Hello, and I'm sure as you can kind of hear DarkSakura's voice is a little not the norm because she is recovering from something.
102484	107450	And so the doctor has said you need to be on vocal rest, but she really wanted to be here and participate anyway.
108411	111814	I had a sinus infection.
111814	112996	I'm off the antibiotics.
112996	115438	I just finished my last dose.
115438	128310	My voice is getting better, but I am on voice rest through Tuesday and possibly through the next weekend, depending on, you know, just trying to avoid what happened last time where my voice went out for three months.
129096	130357	No fun.
130357	134520	So, so Jamie's here, and she'll chime in when she feels like it.
134520	137963	But you might hear less of her tonight, because we're not going to give her stories.
137963	143047	Just so you know, we can respect the whole fact that she's not supposed to be talking a lot.
143047	146189	But I'm really glad to hear that you're recovering.
146189	152214	I mean, I know this sounds weird, but you sound better than where I expected you to be, if that makes sense.
152214	152334	So
154195	158619	You have probably said all of 10 words aloud today.
158619	163323	And I'm sucking down Manuka honey lozenges.
163323	166586	Just helping.
166586	170809	I did play some Cult of the Lamb last night.
170809	174032	And just in saying hello to some people.
174032	175854	Yeah, my voice went right back out.
175854	176014	So
176354	198337	gotcha well chilling let me know if for whatever reason you can't keep hanging in there but we appreciate you being here and uh you can uh you can of course as we mentioned uh watch along with our show live and i'm sure dark soccer will be in chat because the voice may be broken but the fingers ain't so but unfortunately for our podcast folk i know it's hard to see the live chat if you're not here live so
200299	210651	Let me go ahead and say hello to somebody whose voice is perfectly fine for better or for worse, however you want to interpret that.
210651	212293	For average.
212293	213335	Say hello to Loki.
214650	215470	Thank you for watching!
235704	237205	Accidentally click on the video.
237205	239427	I'm kind of laughing.
239427	240228	Stop.
240228	246312	I'm kind of laughing because the game you have playing behind you tonight on the feed is Naughty Bear.
246312	249014	You know, sometimes you have like a game playing.
249014	251196	I actually recognize tonight's game too.
251196	253838	I was curious, what inspired you to pick Naughty Bear tonight?
254713	260174	Oh, just because I saw that article about how Naughty Bear skins being added to Dead by Daylight.
260174	264115	Yeah, I thought that was such well, because I didn't realize that they had developed the game.
264115	267135	So like, funny enough, I didn't either.
267135	269976	So I was like, well, that's a weird video.
269976	280298	That's like, I'm like, that's such a random franchise to license the the character from but I'm like, also thinking, but I bet it would be pretty cheap, because
281365	281745	Trapper in his skin
297156	300177	that the Naughty Bear game uses bear traps.
300177	301737	So there actually is a connection.
301737	303638	Because at first I was like, well, that's kind of random.
303638	304638	But okay, I get it.
304638	311540	It's because it's like, it's an old school, you know, behavior, like a game and an old school behavior character or whatever.
311540	316782	So I was like, Oh, that's but no, there actually is some connection to the actual game, which is interesting.
317062	322506	But yeah, they gave him a whole new killing animation or a Mori.
322506	325568	And he looks like they did a good job with him.
325568	336276	And I think they did a good job of finding that balance of, you know, people aren't going to probably accept him as a licensed killer all on his own, but giving him a place in the game, which is cool.
337145	352278	I mean, yeah, it's cool that, you know, people now find out what Naughty Bear is other than some random game that came out a long time ago that they had a bunch of promotional statues that I somehow ended up with a ton of at one time.
352278	360164	Now, have you have you had a chance to actually see what happens when the Naughty Bear kills somebody in Dead by Daylight?
361105	361806	No.
361806	362927	It is kind of fun.
362927	364088	It is interesting.
364088	370034	Let me quickly, while I'm doing this here, because I do love to do this live.
370034	373297	But actually, let me ask DarkSakura while I get this up.
373297	376499	And I'll ask something that can be answered with a simple yes or no question.
376499	382205	And that question would be, did you already pick up this skin?
382205	384087	I guess maybe it's a two part.
384087	385488	Number one, did you already pick up the skin?
388638	395724	Okay, part part two is gonna be do you plan to but I guess I guess that's that.
395724	396085	All right.
396085	400428	Oh, this is a long video.
400428	403151	Oh, no, that's fine.
403151	403671	That's fine.
403671	405573	I can actually show a little bit here.
405573	407254	Sorry, it's taking me a minute there.
407254	408135	We got it.
408135	409836	So that's what it looks like in the game.
409836	412479	But I thought there's a section Oh, maybe it's right here.
413160	415001	Yeah, I thought, yeah, there you go.
415001	416181	No, that's the start of a match.
416181	417722	I'll find you the actual Mori.
417722	420083	Yeah, it's probably towards the Oh, yeah, here it is.
420083	420343	Here it is.
420343	420603	Here it is.
420603	422044	I see it in the preview.
422044	423224	So there we go.
423224	426365	So they're dragging the person I'll describe this a podcast listener.
426365	428986	So the bear kind of Oh, what is this?
428986	429507	Oh, no.
430707	432268	Oh, they spliced in their own crap.
432268	433528	I hate it when YouTubers do that.
433528	442792	So they they like chop the person in half and then drop them on the ground into the bear trap and the bear trap like closes on their head.
442792	448534	And I know that sounds extremely gruesome, but dead by daylight is also kind of limited in the gore it can show.
448534	450635	So a lot of it is implied.
450635	450775	So
451075	458179	And Rob, the thing about the Mori is that the narrator from Naughty Bear talks.
458179	459300	Oh, I didn't know that.
459300	461321	That's really funny.
461321	475469	And there's also when you, you know, in the lobby and there's also if you pee 100 while you're wearing the Naughty Bear skin, you get a special congratulatory message from the narrator.
475908	479091	Oh my gosh, that's funny.
479091	481092	All right.
481092	485796	Sorry, it's sometimes a little hard to do the YouTubes on the fly.
485796	488278	Okay.
488278	489699	Oh my gosh, I lost the channel.
489699	490239	There we go.
490239	491040	Sorry about that.
491040	492461	Love to do things live.
492461	492761	Okay.
493522	512315	anyway yeah orange right in our chat uh over at twitch tv slash VOG network says minecraft jump scare yeah it was something like that uh bobby blackwolf says i just checked and i do not actually own naughty bear on xbox 360 i thought that maybe i'd kept it but no i probably sold it or gave it away i didn't even know you actually owned that at some point bobby to be honest though
514448	521096	All right, well, let's get into gaming news from the week and pretty big.
521096	527745	It's a one company show that happened this weekend, but it's a company that puts together a lot of games.
527745	530188	Most of them have huge online followings.
530188	532411	And so a lot of people travel to Anaheim
532871	536133	to be at BlizzCon, which we're gonna talk about here at the top of the show.
536133	545738	In fact, I was at BlizzCon, and I just realized when they said during the opening keynote this week, we announced Overwatch in 2014, nine years ago.
545738	547159	That was the BlizzCon I was at.
547159	549320	I was at BlizzCon the year they announced Overwatch.
549320	550440	So that was nine years ago.
550440	553002	I can't even believe it, how time flies.
553002	559125	But this BlizzCon was notable because, in some ways, because it was the first one they've done
559745	574503	since 2019, since COVID, and since, you know, all that stuff came to light about Blizzard and Activision, and let's be real, the rest of the game industry, unfortunately, about the shitty behavior towards
575985	578226	women, and etc.
578226	581467	Other underrepresented communities in gaming.
581467	587889	So, you know, I think there was a lot riding on Blizzard as well to kind of get that right.
587889	590410	A lot of faces have changed, though.
590410	594631	I will say there was a virtual year because I seem to remember Jay Allard, but maybe that was 2019.
594631	596552	Everything kind of blurs together.
596552	602493	I think there was also a virtual year, but this was the first like big year back at the Anaheim Convention Center.
602493	603894	And you can also feel
604434	612000	There's been transitions because this is the first time you get to see Mike Ibarra, who's now the CEO of Blizzard, take the stage.
612000	615783	And I got the sense from him he was a little nervous.
615783	623669	He responded a lot to what was going on in the crowd, which you're really not supposed to do, but it was kind of endearing.
625811	630916	Yeah, I was fine with his presence, and he shared the stage with a lot of different people.
630916	635020	There were, thankfully, multiple POC throughout Blizzard that showed up.
635020	636741	Maybe two, but multiple.
636741	639885	Multiple women that took the stage, including probably one of the longest.
639885	643808	I did not even realize the person behind Warcraft at this point.
645890	651275	Holly, I think her name is, probably had the longest of anybody to talk on the stage.
651275	662283	So it was nice to see a little more diversity on the stage than maybe what we would have seen five years ago at any company's game announcements, that's for sure.
662283	664465	But anyway, let's talk about what they actually talked about.
664465	670690	Loki, do you want to give me some stuff to kind of punt back and forth with here, remind me of some things they talked about at BlizzCon?
671351	675455	Yeah, aside from the fact that the whole event seemed to be very disorganized.
675455	680319	I guess they're a little rusty for not having done it for a few years.
680319	683101	I saw there were people having problems getting in.
683101	688446	Yeah, lines like ridiculous lines that like wrapped blocks around the area.
688446	694071	I know that like the opening ceremony was not in the usual place,
694611	698453	And so it was in a smaller place, and you had to get a ticket to get in there.
698453	705596	And I'm sorry, if I paid to go to BlizzCon, and if I had to watch the opening ceremonies on a fucking TV, I'd be pissed.
705596	710998	And apparently, tickets to BlizzCon were still available the day of the show.
710998	712279	That does not happen.
712279	714279	BlizzCon has been notorious for selling out.
714279	715080	So the response
715760	736116	maybe not exactly where I don't know if they were trying to accommodate more people by opening up another hall or what they were trying to do and I'm not trying to poo-poo on BlizzCon because I do know people that went and had a really good time but I'm just saying I would have been pissed if I had to watch the opening ceremony on the TV when I paid all that money to be there you know what I mean it would have been $600 for two of us to go to BlizzCon
736616	738076	and I would have been pissed if we watched it on TV.
757194	760636	And I'm sure, you know what, I'm sure similar to TwitchCon, here's the thing.
760636	765158	If I did go to BlizzCon, it would be like how I approach TwitchCon.
765158	766459	It's about the community.
766459	770101	And if you go to BlizzCon, it's about your guild.
770101	771882	It's about the people you play Diablo with.
771882	775044	It's about the people you play Overwatch with, or whatever it is.
775044	780887	And I'm sure most people I know that actually went probably got their rewards from that, and that's cool.
780887	783148	I would have loved to go, but I also, I don't play
783148	783829	Overwatch Announcements
802324	809027	So one of which I guess was a new hero that was leaked out, Maga.
809027	813769	And I guess he wields dual chain guns.
813769	815790	So that sounds pretty cool.
815790	818130	Yeah, he looks like a new character.
818130	824113	And I think a new character being unveiled is what you would expect from a keynote for Overwatch.
824113	825533	Yeah.
825533	827694	They have a new game mode called Clash.
829690	832552	which I guess is like sort of like a tug-of-war mode.
832552	837095	And then they're also reworking.
837095	845141	There's two new heroes, or two other heroes, Venture and Space Ranger, are being teased.
845141	849224	I don't think Space Ranger is the final name, but they're showing like concepts of new characters.
849224	851085	Right, exactly.
851085	852826	Space Ranger would be such a generic name.
855034	855835	What else?
855835	868486	Uh, so, uh, yeah, Diablo 4 is getting a new expansion called the Vessel of Hatred.
869395	873617	Great title, and that is gonna be coming out late next year.
873617	875058	A little bit surprising to me.
875058	876419	Well, it is and it isn't.
876419	880141	Like, it's no surprise that Diablo 4 is getting an expansion.
880141	884964	It's a surprise that it's slated a year and a half after the initial release of the game.
884964	890747	So there's going to be a lot of people who are going to look at that and go, money grab.
891513	892414	MoneyGrab
922114	934328	I will say this, the strongest part of Diablo 4 was the main campaign, and I think where people lose Diablo 4 is in some of the endgame stuff, which I do believe has been patched to get better.
934328	939093	As somebody who's a fan of Diablo, I think Season 2 is in a way better place than Season 1 was.
941656	949262	I, and so I say that because the new story in an expansion will be very interesting.
949262	953104	But is it going to be $50 interesting if that's what they end up charging?
953104	960590	And I'm making that guess based on- They'll charge it because it's a premium because you gotta, you know, you gotta pay that premium for games nowadays.
960590	962551	And then $10 for the battle pass.
962551	969997	And then, so it's a little, I don't know, and I'm a fan of Diablo, but even I'm looking at this going, y'all better make it worth it.
969997	970277	Or I'm,
971673	973495	I mean, I'll sit here and go, I'm not going to buy it.
973495	976997	I mean, I probably will, but maybe I won't if I'm angry.
976997	981801	Maybe I won't if I'm angry enough.
981801	983723	What else?
983723	991749	Oh, so they've also got, of course, for Hearthstone, there is going to be an expansion coming for that as well.
991749	996273	That's a Wild West theme called Showdown in the Badlands.
996273	998975	And that is coming out actually in a couple of weeks here.
1000638	1011545	And then along with that, they're going to have some Ketchup Packs that they're going to be adding to allow you to collect cards that were part of, they said, for the last two years of constructed play.
1011545	1017069	Every time that woman from Hearthstone said Ketchup Packs, I thought she said Ketchup Pack.
1017069	1021192	Like, like, do you need me to get you Ketchup Packs at Wendy's for your fries?
1021192	1022352	Like that's every time.
1022352	1024073	It's a brand new Heinz pack.
1024073	1024654	Yeah.
1027165	1045033	And then they also had, I guess, Hearthstone Battlegrounds is a co-op game mode that is one of those like auto battle, auto rumbler type things like they said, like team fight tactics.
1045033	1048595	That sounds extremely mobile, but cool, I guess.
1048595	1053097	Hearthstone was kind of designed to be the iPad game, honestly.
1053097	1055978	Yeah, it does have, you know, mobile and, you know, desktop
1056018	1061581	Well, and speaking of mobile, they've got that Warcraft rumble coming out on mobile devices.
1061581	1063762	That's basically like Clash of Clans.
1063762	1064682	It's how I played it.
1064682	1067303	And I'm going to be honest, I didn't think it was very good.
1067303	1068744	It struck me as a sorry.
1068744	1071005	And there's going to be people who disagree with me, and that's fine.
1071005	1073306	But it struck me as a tower defense game.
1073306	1079229	Like, I know it's not exactly that before people jump in and correct me, but to me, it felt like I was playing a tower defense game.
1079229	1082551	And I was like, OK, tower defense games were fun 10 years ago.
1083351	1084752	Like, I thought we were kind of past that.
1084752	1088195	Like, I wasn't super big on the game.
1088195	1092798	It's one of those cases where this game is for somebody that somebody is not me.
1092798	1093299	That's OK.
1093299	1095340	Yeah.
1095340	1102766	Let's see, World of Warcraft, of course, they announced that Cataclysm is coming to World of Warcraft Classic.
1102766	1105769	That's going to be out the first half of next year.
1105769	1112214	That's controversial because Cataclysm was sort of the reason why people wanted WoW Classic in the first place.
1112725	1115327	because it's just going to become WoW.
1115327	1117009	WoW Classic is WoW.
1117009	1118810	It's just WoW 10 years behind.
1118810	1129360	For those that forgot, WoW Cataclysm changed the original world to bring it up to the level that, you know, it basically hasn't changed since then.
1129360	1132483	The old world, you know, and brought flying to the old world and everything.
1132483	1133203	So it changed.
1133203	1136687	And so people wanted- It was the expansion that got me into the game again.
1138908	1141649	And Alan played Cataclysm an awful lot too.
1141649	1147853	So I'm not saying Cataclysm doesn't have its fans, but I think this release is still going to be controversial.
1147853	1149734	I think it will be less controversial
1150485	1155169	if WoW continues to split some of their classic servers.
1155169	1167659	As they have done, Wrath of the Lich King exists in one bubble, and then true WoW classic exists in another bubble, and then WoW classic hardcore exists in another bubble.
1167659	1171943	But existing in no bubble currently is Burning Crusade.
1171943	1178508	Those servers were bumped up to Wrath of the Lich King, like it or not, which I actually think is okay, because
1179744	1184245	Wrath of the Lich King didn't change that much about Burning Crusade content.
1184245	1193048	So I sort of think as long as they keep a bubble for Wrath of the Lich King, when they open up Cataclysm servers, I think everybody will be satisfied.
1193048	1195048	Those that want to go to Cata can go to Cata.
1195048	1197769	Those that want to stay on Wrath can stay on Wrath.
1197769	1201750	I liked Cata because that's when Atonement Priests were stupid powerful.
1201750	1204391	So I wouldn't mind playing that again.
1204391	1207932	But I also like Wrath of the Lich King for its own reasons.
1207932	1209112	So be interesting.
1210612	1212894	And then, let's see, what else?
1212894	1215756	So they also announced the, what is it?
1215756	1219138	Season of Discovery, which they're teasing new content.
1219138	1224442	It's going to start with a level 25 cap and will increase as time goes on.
1224442	1227604	This is controversial.
1227604	1233088	This is very controversial because this is new content for WoW Classic.
1233088	1238312	And there are going to be those that say, WoW Classic does not need new content.
1238312	1239093	I have to admit,
1240111	1246313	I thought this was the most interesting Warcraft related thing they announced and I'd like to play it.
1246313	1250314	I don't know if it's because I'm kind of in that mindset where I enjoy seasonal gameplay.
1250314	1251414	I like it in No Man's Sky.
1251414	1252834	I like it in Diablo.
1252834	1255875	I think the concept is interesting in Warcraft.
1255875	1258536	25 is not an incredibly high level.
1258536	1262677	I like that it kind of gives an optional thing to do that kind of continues
1263496	1267440	what is happening in WoW Classic.
1267440	1269562	I think it's neat.
1269562	1270743	I'd like to try it.
1270743	1274948	I know, but I know it's not going to be well-received by everybody because, you know, it's, oh, what are they doing?
1274948	1278572	Putting the season content in our game, da-da-da-da-da.
1278572	1280353	And that's valid.
1280353	1286159	But I think it's kind of exciting that now it's like the classic mechanism of the game
1286980	1290704	exists with the modern mechanism of the game.
1290704	1301516	And what will be interesting when WoW Cataclysm comes out, a middle of the road version of the game that bridges the two is very, very interesting to me.
1301516	1304199	So it's going to be weird to see how they do that.
1304199	1304520	Yeah.
1304520	1304740	Yeah.
1306224	1312213	DarkSakura in chat says, I really am not sure it's possible to recapture the magic.
1312213	1316319	And I will say in my experience with Wrath of the Lich King, it hasn't.
1316319	1318222	I mean, it's been neat.
1318222	1320946	But again, it just goes to show Warcraft
1321795	1324056	is made better by the people.
1324056	1340621	And if you have the right people to play the game with and explore with, it's, you know, when Alan and I were first dating 13 years ago, or a long time ago, we would play, wow, Cataclysm, funny enough, was the expansion that was out at the time, because I remember he raided Firelands and did all that stuff.
1340621	1348224	But it was a great way for us because he lived two and a half hour drive from me in South San Francisco, and I lived up here in Sacramento.
1348224	1350825	And it was a really great way for us to be able to
1351405	1371258	hang out quote unquote during the week before I got in the car on Friday and went to go see him on the weekend so again but you know I doubt he's gonna want to play Cataclysm and I'm kind of like I'll play it for a minute you know just to go like oh this is fun oh I love Detonement Priest but if the people aren't there then it's just gonna be like oh okay I'm over it
1371798	1378682	So DarkSakura doing some reminiscing in our chat, shouting out our old Guild Danger Squad and her mage, Rebecca Black.
1378682	1381544	I'm sorry, Rebecca Black was a Paladin, if I remember right.
1381544	1384305	And then, of course, my character was Sassy Pants, the one and only.
1384305	1385106	That's right.
1385106	1386286	So.
1386286	1386807	All right.
1386807	1388327	Anyway, sorry, Loki.
1388327	1388988	Trip down memory lane.
1390296	1391517	World Soul Saga War Within
1408619	1415728	And, um, along with that, they also announced that the last Titan is going to be coming, I think, after that.
1415728	1421516	So it's like, I think, I guess this World Soul Saga is going to be multiple expansions that they're going to be doing.
1421516	1423959	It is overarching story thing.
1424179	1432265	most Blizzcons, we give you one expansion, but this one we're going to give you one, two, three expansions.
1432265	1434846	Ah, there's a second one in there called Midnight.
1434846	1445834	That is between the two, but they didn't really talk about Midnight or the Titan because they were focused on getting people to pre order that first one the Wrath of the what was it called?
1445834	1446895	I forgot the name of it.
1447475	1451478	No, it was the, oh yeah, I see Midnight in there.
1451478	1452539	So the War Within.
1452539	1454640	That's it, the War Within.
1454640	1462806	And I just, because I'm 12, every time I would hear the War Within, I just, my brain, it goes, my ass.
1463226	1468569	Like, it's just like, I can't hear that name and not go, The War Within.
1468569	1469609	It's my ass.
1469609	1475112	Especially Chris Metzen, you know, returning to Blizzard, being up on that stage going, The War Within.
1475112	1481736	And my 12 year old brain goes, My ass.
1481736	1484697	Anyway, so what is the World Soul Saga?
1484697	1488359	It's basically Final Fantasy 14's Zodiac story.
1488359	1490841	And here's the thing.
1490841	1491341	Here's the thing.
1492932	1507102	I'm not going to say that Warcraft is completely ripping off Final Fantasy XIV, because in turn, Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn was heavily inspired by, ironically, Cataclysm from World of Warcraft.
1507102	1510345	Yoshi P. and his team played World of Warcraft Cataclysm
1511065	1514766	in reinventing the world for Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn.
1514766	1530670	So Final Fantasy XIV was in turn inspired by Warcraft, but it's very interesting to see now some of the ways, and I mentioned this when I was talking about my reviews for Dragonflight, is I was like, gee, BlizzCon suddenly feels like they need to do more with cutscenes and telling the story through this.
1530670	1535931	I wonder what, and the new Warcraft interface sure feels a lot like another game I've played,
1536471	1544993	But, and I don't have a problem with any of that, because I think that this competition between the two games is extraordinarily healthy.
1544993	1558657	So this announcement was just kind of funny to me, because I was like, oh, so they saw that Final Fantasy XIV did a 10-year story, basically, with the Zodiark saga, you know, that started in Realm Reborn and ended with Endwalker.
1558657	1563218	And so they have basically said, hey, for the next, you know, we're doing our own saga.
1563218	1564619	And that's a way for them to say,
1565419	1570642	It's a great time to come back to Warcraft and that was said by Chris Metzen multiple times.
1570642	1576566	Now's the time to get your sword and come back to World of Warcraft because a new story is beginning and you don't want to miss it.
1576566	1579168	And that's that's the whole sales pitch with this thing.
1579168	1591136	And so them outlining is like it was basically a here's the fucking receipts that we're we are invested in a multiple year storyline to see this game through here's the receipts.
1592418	1594279	So it's interesting.
1594279	1598381	You know, again, I think the quality of the game is what's important.
1598381	1612027	And similar to Diablo 4 and its expansion, some folks are already noticing that War Within, my ass, is already available to pre-order for $50.
1614222	1622564	And you can look at some, and of course there's a $70 Legendary Edition and I think a $90, you know, literally in your ass edition.
1622564	1626844	Are they taking the content of one expansion and spreading it over three?
1626844	1629845	Are they pulling an EA Sports type thing with that?
1629845	1640407	I don't know if I would go that far, but based on the content they showed at BlizzCon, and I understand there may be more to come, but based on the content they showed at BlizzCon,
1641147	1646511	Four new zones, no new classes, one new allied race.
1646511	1654077	It does seem like there's less content than what you would expect in a normal expansion, but yet they're charging the same price.
1654077	1655278	That is going to be a sticking point.
1655278	1660362	Now, again, maybe there's more to come, so we should give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard.
1660362	1664206	But I'm not convinced to drop $50 just yet.
1666641	1671062	I know for me, the benefit of the doubt's always worked out when it comes to the gaming industry.
1671062	1672142	Yeah, right?
1672142	1672782	Always.
1672782	1679103	Always trusting the game industry to do the right thing.
1679103	1681104	I find the plan interesting.
1681104	1685484	I think it is a gamble, but I think Warcraft has to take a gamble.
1685484	1689345	I think, again, the fact that BlizzCon did not sell out tickets.
1689345	1691726	It did well, and I'm not shitting on BlizzCon by any means.
1691726	1692926	I don't want people to take that away.
1694486	1713024	I was happy to watch it at home and you know the Diablo stuff of course has me pumped even even if I'm a little iffy on the expansion but you know there's a lot of time to go I really like what I really liked about Diablo was we've still got more stuff coming to season two and a Christmas themed event or you know holiday themed event and uh in season my cow level in
1713644	1721727	Well, they haven't brought that yet, but then they're already talking about some of the things for season three and leaderboards and some of these other things that they're putting in the game without needing an expansion to do it.
1721727	1725549	So it really sounds like the expansion is really going to be focused on story, which is fine.
1725549	1726729	Again, that was the best part of Diablo.
1726729	1740174	But anyway, there was a lot about BlizzCon I liked, but you can't help but notice, gosh, usually you can't get a ticket to BlizzCon if you weren't on your computer pounding that refresh key the day tickets went on sale.
1740174	1741435	That was not the case this year.
1743634	1748327	And Bobby Blackwolf points out it's not the only event that hasn't sold out immediately since returning after 2020.
1749352	1757916	And I think, I think it's still worth pointing out, not everybody is still comfortable with the concept of getting in a big room full of people.
1757916	1764259	There are still plenty of people out there and everybody has the right to make that choice judgment free.
1764259	1768061	If they are like, you know what, I am going to stay home and do the virtual version.
1768061	1777986	Thousands of people, pretty much, I would say probably 98% of them not, probably 99% of them not wearing masks, if TwitchCon's any guide, just not the space for me to be at this time.
1778926	1802491	and that could have an impact on this as we've seen with you know other events too so um all of that should be taken into account I suppose sure but there there was hundreds was what maybe like 160 000 people when I glanced at the counter watching on uh twitch and that's just twitch not youtube or any other stuff so um there were plenty of people online watching it seemed so
1804096	1804236	to get
1821115	1829561	We know more at Twitch, you know, so that's, you know, probably the con we'll choose to go to moving forward.
1829561	1832723	Depending on when a possible, well, there won't be a 14 FanFest next year.
1832723	1833544	That's every other year.
1833544	1834865	So that makes that decision easier.
1834865	1836946	Do you think that they would do something?
1836946	1839408	I mean, I don't remember.
1839408	1841329	Was Call of Duty part of this?
1841329	1841509	No.
1841509	1842190	Presentation?
1842190	1843371	Or is it just Blizzard?
1843371	1846353	I wonder if they would try to like... Nothing Microsoft, nothing Activision, only Blizzard.
1847573	1854440	I'm wondering if they would consider bringing in Activision stuff to try to get the numbers up.
1854440	1856522	I know, hard to say.
1856522	1862248	It's something that's always surprised me in my years of going to Final Fantasy XIV FanFest as well.
1862248	1869856	As I always kind of said, I said, I'm surprised they don't turn this more into a Final Fantasy, without a number, FanFest.
1872697	1878340	And of course, put most of the content in 14, you're bread and butter.
1878340	1884822	But like, I remember the last time I went, which was not this last one, I went to the one before, which was pre-COVID.
1884822	1885903	It was a long time ago at this point.
1885903	1890285	It was the one where they announced, not Endwalker,
1891950	1892511	Shadowbringer
1922471	1922731	BlizzCon 2021
1941004	1951437	No, I meant like, I mean I guess technically Activision Blizzard, but like I just thought like the Activision title since it's technically same company-ish, you know.
1951437	1957144	Well, but I also have a feeling that Phil Spencer's leadership is going to lead to Blizzard being more independent.
1957805	1972397	and especially him taking the stage at BlizzCon and kind of explicitly saying that we respect what Blizzard is, it actually has me hopeful.
1972397	1974139	Because again, throughout this whole process,
1974899	1977260	where I've been like, Bobby Kotek needs to go.
1977260	1978961	We know that's happening at the beginning of the year.
1978961	1992267	Phil Spencer, I don't love big fish eating other big fish, but if anybody seems to fucking get it right now, Phil Spencer does seem to be a decent CEO in the gaming industry, which are slim fucking pickings these days, right?
1992267	1997069	So Phil Spencer does seem to get it, and I got the vibe.
1997069	1999690	He didn't say it explicitly, but I got his vibe that he's like,
2000421	2003903	Blizzard worked very well as an independent organization.
2003903	2006404	We will continue to honor that.
2006404	2018671	But I think Microsoft would be foolish to not sneak other games in the next BlizzCon, have a little section of the hall for some other games that might appeal to some of the BlizzCon audience.
2018671	2022272	I mean, you got like all those different studios doing different RPGs and stuff.
2022272	2023313	I would think that that would work.
2023680	2029843	Fantasy Star Online 2 is a big Microsoft thing that yeah, I know it's Sega, but you know, it's a big thing on Xbox.
2029843	2032744	Why not have just some computers to check that out?
2032744	2036005	Or, you know, again, you know, just just it doesn't have to be the focus.
2036005	2043089	It doesn't have to be the announcements, but just one of those like recommendation because you watch this YouTube, you might like these other things.
2043089	2045670	I think it is foolish to completely leave those out.
2045670	2051832	But that's, you know, I guess if they were there, somebody would bitch that, oh, Microsoft's taken over.
2051832	2053073	They're taking over our community.
2053433	2055674	Yeah, but like, I don't know.
2055674	2056874	Let's talk about that for a second.
2056874	2064196	Sorry, I didn't mean this Blizzcon thing to go on for an hour, but I will say there's something that wasn't there that kind of surprised me.
2064196	2078220	And that was all of this talk about Heroes of the Storm possibly coming back because Heroes of the Storm, which was, you know, their answer to League of Legends, Dota 2, it was their MOBA, right?
2078220	2082502	I shouldn't say was, the game still exists, but it has existed in a
2083542	2087084	uh, basically steady status only.
2087084	2089024	We're done supporting it anymore.
2089024	2090545	Yeah, for the last two years.
2090545	2091425	It's there.
2091425	2094267	It's been in a state of it's there for two years.
2094267	2101790	There was a big patch that came out a couple weeks ago, about a month ago, that had, and it was like, we're balancing characters.
2101790	2102610	We're changing things.
2102610	2108773	That had a lot of people thinking, Oh shit, BlizzCon's going to announce a Heroes of the Storm revival.
2110580	2129205	Now, there was another camp saying, oh, well if Microsoft just bought Warcraft and when Phil Spencer hits the stage, they're going to announce World of Warcraft coming to Xbox.
2129205	2130566	And that's going to be the big announcement.
2131466	2136253	And of course, that was not announced, even though Xbox is showing it can pull off an MMO.
2136253	2140479	But here I am, here's the thing, and this is the thing that blows my mind.
2140479	2143984	Why didn't anybody suggest this?
2143984	2147249	Take those two things I just talked about and combine them.
2148400	2159684	I thought Heroes of the Storm would release on Xbox, and that was going to be the big news, because that game especially would work very well on console, I believe, as many MOBAs do.
2159684	2160824	Well, I think they could.
2160824	2162364	It just surprised me.
2162364	2164205	It's just it's early to do all that.
2164205	2165865	So that's the development time.
2165865	2169227	So I think that could probably happen.
2169227	2172327	It's just right now it's development time.
2172327	2173888	And, you know, they probably weren't
2174502	2183791	They were probably chummy with Microsoft, but the deal wasn't solidified yet, so... It may just give it some time.
2183791	2186213	But yeah, I could totally see that stuff happening at some point.
2187150	2193917	TigerClaw says, WoW coming to Xbox would require a mouse and keyboard to play unless they figure out a way to adapt it to work with controllers.
2193917	2201324	Well, Final Fantasy has shown you can do an MMO with controllers, not just that, I mean, Phantasy Star again, you know, there's plenty of MMOs that do work with controllers.
2201324	2210332	Yes, it would take a rethinking of WoW from a very, you know, but also you can technically hook up a mouse and keyboard to the systems.
2210332	2211534	So but I get that
2212134	2217197	Again, and this is why I didn't expect Warcraft coming to Xbox to be this soon.
2217197	2226423	It's going to take a fundamental reinvention of some aspects of Warcraft that I don't think, you know, and now with a 10-year commitment to the story, I don't know if we're gonna see that at some point.
2226423	2226803	We'll see.
2226803	2227083	We'll see.
2227083	2228064	It's a long game at this point.
2228604	2238633	But that's why I'm like, but the the dormant properties make a lot of sense to drove up new interest by putting them on Xbox.
2238633	2240675	I think Heroes of the Storm on Xbox would be huge.
2240675	2242917	And I can't believe nobody.
2242917	2243758	I'm somebody out there.
2243758	2244379	I'm sure did.
2244379	2245920	I'm not like singular in my thinking.
2245920	2250664	But no, the the wave did not pick up on that line of thought.
2250664	2251845	That may be a different
2252765	2253285	StarCraft 3
2276161	2279162	So anyway, we'll see.
2279162	2280663	All right, let's move on from Blizzard.
2280663	2286585	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2286585	2292346	I will go to DarkSakura to see what she wants to say here.
2292346	2293487	Had to unmute.
2293487	2293927	That's fine.
2293927	2297648	I don't know any point while I'm muted, but whatever.
2297648	2299749	I played Dead by Daylight.
2300864	2305387	and I've played Cult of the Lamb last night.
2305387	2313371	I didn't want to start a Treasure of the Rudress until I can speak to make commentary on it.
2313371	2322135	I've played a lot of Dreamlight Valley and I got a game called Stonehearth
2322455	2324416	I think is what it's called.
2324416	2329438	And I actually picked it up because I watched Matthew Cote play it.
2329438	2332078	I was there on his birthday stream.
2332078	2337880	The guy from Behavior, that Matthew Cote.
2337880	2342062	And it looked really cute and really fun, so I got it.
2342062	2345143	I haven't had a chance to start it yet.
2345143	2349304	And I've played a little bit of pinball and
2350985	2353188	Yeah, that's it.
2353188	2354109	Alright.
2354109	2355190	Loki, how was your commute?
2356627	2358828	Well, it's all Minecraft, as usual.
2358828	2368789	So I split my time between Channel 64 stuff, where I built a giant storage room, or still building a giant storage room.
2368789	2371110	It's pretty much done.
2371110	2378651	And then also the Guardian XP farm, so I have that coming back in my next episode as well.
2378651	2380312	And then also, I think...
2381892	2385014	Yeah, this week was Halloween.
2385014	2397483	I put out my first episode of the Deep Dark World series, which I had done before, and now it's on RazeWorks' server, so I'm doing that.
2397483	2399524	I've been filming stuff on there as well.
2399524	2406529	I played that for quite a bit today, setting up different things, and hopefully going to get another episode of that out soon.
2406969	2411812	Trying to go back and forth between Channel 64 and the Razorworks one.
2411812	2414493	I'm kind of disappointed that he's not going to make content for it.
2414493	2424539	I mean, he's streaming from it, but he said he's not going to do a YouTube series on it because people are more interested in the new update stuff that's coming out.
2424539	2426199	So.
2426199	2427780	Fine, it's fine.
2429724	2436174	But I have a giant build I planned for it already, and it's gonna be ridiculously large, because that's what I do.
2436174	2438077	I can't do anything simple.
2438077	2438798	Heh.
2438798	2443365	So, um, look forward to that.
2443365	2443646	Alright.
2445311	2449235	My gaming week, so obviously I'm still playing Diablo 4 in Season 2.
2449235	2455342	My character hit level 61, which is notable because it took me 8 days to hit level... wait, are we on 8 days?
2455342	2456663	Maybe 9?
2456663	2464552	Remember, I didn't play the first day, it took me a week, but it was about 8 or 9 days I got to level 61, which in contrast, the entire time between
2464992	2465753	Thanks for watching!
2486014	2489398	And I'll probably do that again if not this week, then probably next week.
2489398	2492221	This week's a little busy for me personally, so we'll see.
2492221	2495424	Until you get to the weekend, then I have like a completely free weekend.
2495424	2499408	But just during the week randomly got very busy for me, so we'll see when I get to one of those.
2499408	2501871	But I did play other stuff too, don't worry.
2501871	2502592	I finally
2503172	2506076	Also, you know, it took me a week to get to Diablo 4 Season 2.
2506076	2513184	It took me a week and a half to get to Super Mario Wonder, which I finally played on the Nintendo Switch, and I did a stream of that game.
2513184	2522715	And, you know, when it started and there was a very basic title screen and kind of not a lot of setup to it, I was like, all right, I guess we're just kind of getting up and going in.
2523555	2527677	But to be fair, I mean, didn't any classic Mario game, I guess, kind of start like that?
2527677	2528637	So sure.
2528637	2531359	And then I jumped right in and I was like, OK, this game's cute.
2531359	2532239	This game's really cute.
2532239	2547026	And, you know, I like how they kind of took the touch fuzzy, get dizzy concept, which everybody remembers that if you ever played Super Mario World 2, you know, the Yoshi and the Crying Babies game, you remember the touch fuzzy, get dizzy level.
2547026	2547766	It was iconic.
2548406	2561115	And I'm not saying they took that literal effect and put it in the game, but they took a game's, you know, the stage changes type of mechanic and put it into Wonder.
2561115	2567259	And I think part of the reason why people are loving Wonder is that what that mechanic is essentially changes every time.
2567799	2572163	The different enemies in the game change every level, you're learning new stuff, you're finding new stuff.
2572163	2576687	And so it's like, dang, there's a lot of stuff to figure out.
2576687	2578168	And that's where the wonder is, right?
2578168	2581551	Oh, it's the wonder of finding all these new mechanics and doing these different things.
2581551	2584573	So I you know, it's it is a lot of fun.
2584573	2591580	The one if I have to find something to nitpick on in this game, I mean, it's a great 2d Mario game, people are eating it up.
2591580	2594242	And I do see why I'm gonna say
2596544	2600187	even though I might get a little bit of, you know, pushback on it.
2600187	2614298	I did enjoy Odyssey a little bit more, just because I think even that sense, which is weird if you consider my history with 2D and 3D Marios, because historically I haven't been into 3D Marios, but I loved Odyssey.
2614298	2619222	And like the Wonder in that game, I think just for me was at a whole other level.
2619222	2622545	But don't get me wrong, I really like Super Mario Wonder,
2622725	2625787	but I'm not so sure about all this talk of best Mario game.
2625787	2626888	But I also haven't finished it.
2626888	2628569	So maybe the best is yet to come.
2628569	2630190	We shall see.
2630190	2631831	But I like it an awful lot.
2631831	2633512	I like the things they do with this mechanic.
2633512	2637155	What I don't like, I don't like what they did with online.
2637155	2643059	I understand what they were trying to do with the shadow, the ghosts and the stands to
2643419	2651546	kind of help you in a pinch there that I think it's I think it's all so stinking distracting from what you're actually trying to from actually trying to play the game.
2651546	2654869	It might be interesting if you're going back trying to clean up levels.
2654869	2659734	And ultimately, that's probably how you find some of the more difficult to find wonder seeds.
2660174	2666795	Instead of going on to YouTube to look it up, you could just turn on multiplayer and watch where the other people go, and you could probably figure it out that way.
2666795	2675217	That's probably where that gets good, but as far as, like, just starting the game and being in the first couple levels and stuff, I thought the online was bad.
2675217	2679158	Darthusia says, well, I think isn't the online stuff by default?
2679158	2687880	Yes, but right about the time you get to that bridge between the first and the second world, the game strongly encourages you to turn it on.
2688800	2691702	And I don't think you should, to be honest.
2691702	2696566	Well, they got to sell you those Nintendo online passes.
2696566	2696906	Yeah.
2696906	2697447	Why?
2697447	2698387	Yeah, that's true.
2698387	2699028	That's true.
2699028	2703752	But, you know, again, maybe it's because I'm at a different point in the game.
2703752	2706213	And it's it's I understand people are going to have different viewpoints.
2706213	2706834	It's fine.
2706834	2711878	But just for me, I thought the online was distracting and not relevant to what I was trying to do.
2711878	2712979	So this is what it is.
2714175	2716317	but I do like the game and I do recommend it.
2716317	2718299	You know, because here's the thing.
2718299	2739839	If nothing else, Nintendo, and for all the shit they get about being behind on the tech game, being behind on the online game, and all these places where Nintendo lacks, Nintendo continues to knock it out of the fucking park by giving us a solid, relatively bug-free, I know y'all are gonna find bugs, I know the speedrunning community has found their way through it, but you know what I mean.
2740319	2752321	compared to other games comparable games on the market a relatively bug free solid fucking game out the gate for the price they're charging I will say Nintendo if nothing else is the company you can trust
2753735	2762957	to not sell a $50 expansion later on for Mario Wonder 2, Mario Wonderful, Mario Wonderous, and that whole thing.
2762957	2772760	Nintendo delivers a rock-solid fucking experience out of the gate, and I will absolutely give them that, despite any of my maybe little negative blips I've just put out there about Mario Wonder.
2774434	2775995	Anyway, um, let's see.
2775995	2781777	Other than that, I played a little bit of Theatrhythm because I realized I'm so behind on the DLC.
2781777	2786400	Did y'all know the Final Fantasy XVI music DLC finally came out this last week?
2786400	2788561	And it does add a new category.
2788561	2792022	Unlike the other DLC, it adds a Final Fantasy XVI category.
2792022	2793123	I was bored and I did a
2794323	2798264	No commentary playthrough on my personal channel, just for fun.
2798264	2800665	And I played through all the songs in XVI.
2800665	2813248	I found that I liked some of the songs better now that I kind of heard them through theatrhythm, because you might remember the soundtrack ended up being kind of a disappointment in XVI, considering that Soken is like a fucking legend when it comes to Final Fantasy XIV.
2813248	2821990	But when you put the XVI music side by side with XIII, XII, XI, and the games before it that weren't XIV,
2823550	2824952	It holds its own next to 12.
2824952	2826574	It's on par with 12 or 13.
2826574	2828796	There's some really good songs.
2828796	2830218	There's some filler songs.
2830218	2832921	So you know, that's, that's fine.
2832921	2837627	So I do recommend the 16 DLC if you didn't already buy the Uber Pass for Theatrhythm.
2837627	2841171	If you did buy the Uber Pass for Theatrhythm, here's your reminder.
2841451	2843633	You've probably missed a lot of DLC.
2843633	2847176	Did you know Bravely Default and Bravely Default 2 came out?
2847176	2848717	Did you know Xenogears came out?
2848717	2851019	Did you know Secret of Mana came out?
2851019	2852340	You might be a little bit behind.
2852340	2857964	So here's your little reminder to go back to theatrhythm, especially if you bought that Uber pack, because you're probably missing a lot of DLC.
2857964	2858845	I know I was.
2858845	2861067	So there's that.
2861067	2862028	All right.
2862028	2863929	That was basically it for my gaming week.
2863929	2866771	So let's get into some gaming news.
2867822	2872726	Loki, oh boy, this is DJRamaS says, I bought the UberPack.
2872726	2873646	Thanks, Rob.
2873646	2874387	You're welcome.
2874387	2876128	I knew it wouldn't just be me.
2876128	2882253	So for all those of you, if you if you dumped a shit ton of money on theater when it first came out, here is your reminder.
2882253	2883694	Cash it in.
2883694	2885315	There's content waiting for you.
2885315	2886776	Go get it.
2886776	2887116	Enjoy.
2887116	2892901	Yeah, let's talk about Silent Hill.
2892901	2893501	Ascension.
2893501	2894022	We have to.
2896184	2905031	Oh man, remember at the beginning of this year when they did the Silent Hill Direct, we were so excited for Silent Hill.
2905031	2908633	You know, yes, there was that nagging voice.
2908633	2912817	There's that nagging voice going, is Konami going to get this right?
2912817	2915559	Is Konami really going to get this right?
2915559	2918441	And as it turns out, the answer is clusterfuck.
2920069	2926470	So Silent Hill Ascension is a weird thing.
2926470	2935352	It's basically like a live stream that you have like a choose your own adventure aspect to that.
2935352	2940993	Except the choose your own adventure part, you pay to make votes, which is strange.
2940993	2948995	There's emotes and then there's a chat and they have episodes that air nightly that are 15 minutes long.
2950399	2956204	And of course, you know, because it's an online chat, it just evolves into garbage.
2956204	2959087	Because that's just what's going on.
2959087	2960709	And so of course, you know...
2962708	2966951	They even, I think, allowed you to do, like, these super chat things.
2966951	2972635	I think by just, like, you got one or something for signing up as a, you know, a user on this.
2972635	2976597	And so, of course, I was spamming the most ridiculous things.
2976597	2979799	Some of the ones that they note in the article here.
2979799	2990507	It says, apparently, people wanted Pyramid Head's cummy in my tummy and Pyramid Head to appear with big boing boing.
2991607	2994269	need PyramidHead to impregnate me.
2994269	3002735	So, wonderful things that they add to the experience that is just pretty bad overall.
3002735	3007958	I tried watching a little bit of... I'm sorry, that was PyramidHead what?
3007958	3014843	Wants to impregnate... Someone announced that they need PyramidHead to impregnate me.
3016454	3021197	So whoever that user was, I just want to say not me, because that's just ridiculous.
3021197	3030965	In 21 years of doing Orange Lounge Radio, the editorial decision to make Loki read this story is by far my smartest decision as a producer.
3030965	3033186	Exactly.
3033186	3034807	It says apparently it says
3037514	3044356	Apparently they had pulled the chat for the second episode because they're still working out things.
3044356	3056158	It says, up until we can figure out how we handle the moderation queue, we're going to limit chat to stickers and hopefully I can get emojis in there too.
3056158	3056479	Wow.
3059554	3061754	So yeah, it's bad.
3061754	3062255	It's bad.
3062255	3068776	And then I guess the actual game, if you will, itself is also bad and absurd.
3068776	3073077	So, um, yeah.
3073077	3076897	And they have a battle pass because of course they do.
3076897	3086119	And apparently, uh, the funny enough, uh, Hideo Kojima, uh, I think his name is banned in chat.
3087284	3087925	which is weird.
3087925	3092468	Well, if you say it three times, he'll appear, you know.
3092468	3098173	I mean, I guess it is safe that they do that.
3098173	3099495	Yeah, I don't know.
3099495	3100535	It looks bad.
3100535	3102497	I watched clips of it.
3102497	3103858	It looks bad.
3103858	3110864	It's really funny because I think Jamie stepped AFK or something because her avatar is doing all this crazy like neck spinning around things and all that stuff.
3110864	3114527	And I'm like, honestly, exactly my reaction to the news on this game.
3116578	3119682	and all the talk about microtransactions and stuff.
3119682	3124727	Like Questbuster in chat says, people were upset over the microtransactions too.
3124727	3133777	One of the memes showed a letter from one of the other Silent Hill games, only they cut it off and asked for 5,000 influencer points to read the rest of it.
3133777	3137801	As if somebody wouldn't just copy it and put it on the internet for people to read for free.
3139341	3140622	Influencer points?
3140622	3142243	Yeah, QuestBuster elaborates.
3142243	3151429	From what I understand, to vote for community decisions in the game, you need influencer points that you can grind by doing puzzles and playing the game.
3151429	3152309	You know what that's like?
3152309	3158593	That's like you need to call 1-900-AMERICAN-IDOL-01 to vote for Clay Aiken.
3158593	3161335	Only 99 cents a call.
3161335	3162976	You know, check, you know, whatever it is.
3162976	3165438	It sounds like one of those things where, you know,
3166258	3171259	you gotta call the 900 number if you want to vote, and it costs money per vote.
3171259	3175981	This is the modern version of that, and gamers are not having it.
3175981	3194486	What I would say then for that, as was popular when American Idol was around like that, which I think it's still around, but back in its heyday, there was a movement called Vote for the Worst, and I encourage everybody to vote for the worst.
3194486	3195206	That poor kid.
3196994	3198656	Kind of fucked up in retrospect.
3198656	3200158	I mean, what that kid went through.
3200158	3203001	But anyway, yes, I get it.
3203001	3205424	So.
3205424	3207547	So, yeah, don't watch it.
3207547	3209249	It's bad.
3209249	3213014	Hopefully this the two remake is better.
3214330	3214510	Oh no.
3230761	3231542	Thanks for watching!
3247625	3254130	Okay, more information about Silent Hill 2 or whatever.
3254130	3261796	Here's the third, you know, typical things like enjoy the experience of playing through a horror game all with modern graphics exclusively on PlayStation 5.
3261796	3270542	But here it is, fan favorite character Pyramid Head makes a return along with a special origin story for fans to play through.
3270542	3273144	And this has a lot of people going, what?
3274105	3278148	because is this just more Pyramid Head wank?
3278148	3282832	Like, and I get and not in the sense that Loki was just talking about, but like, here's the thing.
3282832	3291098	Yes, Pyramid Head is an iconic Silent Hill character, but he was supposed to very specifically represent some things
3291698	3292299	RedPyramidhead
3311129	3312850	So it's become this big ol' thing.
3312850	3317912	And so now people are looking at it going, oh God, is this another money grab?
3317912	3323674	Are they gonna do Pyramid Head DLC just to get people to pump down more money for this game?
3323674	3332238	Now, to be fair, if I read that bullet point again, but I'm gonna read it with different emphasis and grammar.
3332238	3338481	Fan favorite character Pyramid Head makes a return, along with a special origin story for fans to play through.
3339312	3349675	Now you'll notice I changed the emphasis and it reads a lot differently because you may or may not recall Silent Hill 2 did have DLC that was an origin story of sorts.
3349675	3350975	That did exist.
3350975	3354136	So maybe they're talking about that.
3354136	3359118	But I think grammatically that would need to be two different bullet points to read that way.
3359118	3362959	So there's still a lot of question marks there.
3362959	3365880	So we'll wait and see, I guess.
3365880	3366840	Yes, we will.
3366840	3367360	Yes, we will.
3368137	3371220	Alright, let's move on.
3371220	3384253	This is some real bummer news that came out this last week, and that is there were folks that were laid off at Bungie, of course the makers of Destiny 2, and they are working on Marathon, a reinvention of one of their older titles.
3384253	3386736	And of course Bungie, you know, did Halo for a very, very long time.
3387116	3389056	They are a legendary studio in the industry.
3389056	3390557	They are now owned by Sony.
3390557	3394478	You may or may not recall, purchased them not that long ago.
3394478	3397959	It is said that this does not have to do with that purchase.
3397959	3401159	This is not something that Sony commanded.
3401159	3406861	But however it happened, it does suck to hear that 100 employees have been affected by the layoffs.
3406861	3411082	Bungie warned employees of the company's current financial underperformance.
3412882	3424046	It was reported that the developer laid off employees in its community, development, art, and audio teams, including Michael Salvatore, longtime Halo and Destiny soundtrack composer.
3424046	3426847	Apparently, Marathon has been delayed.
3426847	3430089	The next Destiny 2 expansion, delayed.
3430089	3438452	There was a meeting in that morning that revenue was 45% lower than projected, which CEO Pete Parsons claimed was due to a drop
3438932	3441993	Destiny 2 popularity and poor player retention.
3452520	3454621	but I digress.
3454621	3462967	The final shape expansion, it was mentioned in the meeting, had received only good feedback, so it's been delayed to make it better.
3462967	3472174	Apparently, there were other cost-cutting measures considered, at least according to Pete Parsons, hiring freezes, salary freezes, but it didn't matter.
3472174	3476157	Ultimately, 8% of the workforce was laid off.
3476157	3477998	Here's the shitty part.
3477998	3480760	October 30th was the day that that happened.
3480760	3481701	Employee benefits.
3482557	3484865	were given through the end of the month!
3484865	3486431	That's right, the very next day, October 31st.
3488993	3490974	Of course, that's almost on purpose.
3490974	3501741	You know that now, to be fair, they were given three months of health care and severance pay, but three months is not exactly time to land on your feet with something new.
3501741	3504343	So it's still a bummer to hear about.
3504343	3512789	And, you know, and when I was talking to Bobby Blackwolf on his show tonight, because he's kind enough to have me on at the end of a show every week to talk about what's coming up on this show.
3512789	3515591	And, you know, we were talking a little bit about this whole kind of
3516411	3528335	Yen and Yang thing going on is that 2023, you know, especially when you look at these games that just came out in the past couple weeks, Super Mario Wonder, Alan Wake 2, we haven't talked a lot about that game on this show, because I haven't gotten around to it yet.
3528335	3539980	But apparently that game is very fucking good from what a lot of people are telling me like so much where I'm like, fuck, I need to go back and play the original Alan Wake, Control, like really set myself up for, you know, Alan Wake 2.
3541721	3559116	2023 has been a fucking fantastic year for games and we've been saying that a lot on this show yet that is happening meanwhile 2023 is a fucking horrific year to be a game developer and it it's a like you would think now
3560134	3573425	You would think, and before you all yell out the punchline, yes I know the punchline, you would think in a year where all the games are really well received and games are thriving, you would think game development thrives too.
3574500	3578123	But unfortunately, the punchline, they're on different cycles.
3578123	3580905	Games take years to make.
3580905	3591533	And when you don't spend years making your game, well, just check out that new Kong game that came out, because apparently it only took a year to make, and it shows.
3591533	3593595	So, yes, these things are on different cycles.
3595456	3623200	but it's it's it's weird to celebrate what a great year for games 2023 has been when it has been such a shit year for developers and especially not not not senior executives at these companies mind you community managers we're talking about in large part here which is which if if you want your game to always be on and a living breathing 24 seven 365 game you need community managers
3623920	3630085	I don't... Well, why didn't you rile the fans up and make them like our game more?
3630085	3631106	It's all your fault.
3631106	3632607	Bye-bye.
3632607	3633068	Wild.
3633942	3634662	Wild.
3634662	3641544	I know that's not actually what their their thought process is probably like well we feel that it's expendable so yeah we're gonna get rid of them.
3641544	3642124	Yeah.
3642124	3651047	Questbuster with an interesting perspective here that maybe this is a consequence of some of the you know basically throwing around that's happened with Bungie the last few years.
3651047	3659569	Questbuster saying a reason for the increasing monetization within Destiny 2 has also been speculated to try to stop the bleeding going on with Bungie's finances.
3660109	3671811	Activision let them go, Bungie did their thing for a while, and then were bought by Sony, and now, reporting having lost 45% of their revenue, resulting in layoffs.
3671811	3687914	Just a friendly reminder, I just, just a friendly reminder, the peep, the reason why people still defend Nintendo to this day, and the legendary, late, great, wonderful, Satoru Iwata, is that when the Wii U bombed, guess who took a pay cut?
3690114	3692536	Did the CEO of Bungie take a pay cut?
3692536	3695437	Because I didn't hear that reported in the news.
3695437	3697959	Did Bobby Kotick take a pay cut?
3697959	3698740	I don't think I heard that.
3698740	3700321	Is Yves Gouman taking a pay cut?
3700321	3704303	I don't think they have.
3704303	3708166	I hope these CEOs never speak the name Satoru Iwata.
3708166	3710167	They are not worthy of saying that name.
3715506	3724730	In chat, ssj0100mat says, it sucks when you read that managers were sounding the alarms that fans went XYZ and the higher-ups not making those priority.
3724730	3729912	DJRamaS does bring up the point that, you know, what I'm talking about is different cultures.
3729912	3734154	Yes, and gaming is a worldwide economy at this point.
3734154	3738396	And so those walls start to crumble.
3738396	3742418	But again, I want to point to who do the fans respect at the end of the day?
3743493	3749418	Do they respect the Japanese CEOs or the American CEOs?
3749418	3752420	Phil Spencer's eye.
3752420	3756123	End of sentence.
3756123	3758906	Yes, and Mike Deft says, Satoru Iwata may not have been perfect.
3758906	3772797	No, and I do want to be careful what pedestal I put him on here, but again, in the context of what we're talking about here, there is a reason why people don't talk about Satoru Iwata the way they talk about
3774022	3780588	Bobby Kotick, you know, or some of these other folks may not have been perfect, but he was truly a great person.
3780588	3781990	Indeed.
3781990	3787274	Also, Satoru Iwata knew how to make a Nintendo game.
3787274	3788215	Do you think Bobby Kotick?
3788215	3789757	It's kind of like it.
3789757	3791619	Well, it's kind of like how you have.
3791619	3793961	And this is just even in a corporate world, too.
3793961	3796223	It's where you have people that were
3797177	3807223	doing the low-level jobs and then work their way up to be a manager, CEO, supervisor, that type of thing, and then you have the people that are just hired in to be that position.
3807223	3817669	And the ones that have done the job understand the nuances of it, they understand what the people below them are going through, and that's why they're a little bit more humble and a little bit more
3818269	3837484	You know, willing to take accountability for things versus the folks that just come in, don't have any idea how anything is being done, just trying to manage, I guess, but... Or perfect example, coming in to start something from the ground up.
3837484	3839946	Hello, Phil Harrison and Google Stadia.
3839946	3840547	Let's see how that...
3843368	3849571	Sorry to open a wound, but like just case in point to what Loki's talking about.
3849571	3851712	I almost spit out my meatball.
3851712	3852752	I'm sorry, DarkSakura.
3852752	3859595	I know you're already sick and you don't need to get sicker, but like it just like it just puts underscores Loki's point.
3861653	3870642	So it's just, you know, there's certain types of people and some some are going to be successful.
3870642	3872645	Some are not going to be successful.
3872645	3880613	Sometimes you have a charlatan that really pushes the importance of the dog in a game.
3880613	3884097	And then you come to find out, yeah, this game is just a normal RPG.
3886092	3889353	And maybe there isn't going to be an AI child anymore, you know?
3889353	3889793	Oh, yes.
3889793	3891273	I know you're talking about now.
3891273	3893454	Oh, yes.
3893454	3896094	And no one really gives a crap what's inside the cube.
3896094	3900175	So whatever.
3900175	3902175	Anyway, do you know what was inside the cube?
3902175	3903036	Do you know what was inside?
3903036	3905996	Hopes and dreams literally was what was inside the cube.
3905996	3911437	I mean, yes, it was a Kickstarter, but you had to hope and dream that that game was going to be a success or it didn't mean shit.
3911437	3912158	All right.
3912158	3912878	It was Goddess.
3912878	3913958	Don't forget was the name of that.
3915515	3917116	Oh, I already forgot it.
3917116	3921300	And I thought you were gonna say some prayers, which is about the same.
3921300	3924602	Probably Yeah, thoughts and prayers were definitely in the cube as well.
3924602	3925463	All right.
3925463	3927084	Yeah.
3927084	3934430	SSG100 Matt says but like they let Lorraine McLeese go she was with Bungie since pre Halo did a lot with that company in the art department.
3936321	3953848	QuestBuster, going back to Iwata, saying, one of the anecdotes I remember from the book, Ask Iwata, from a developer, describes showing him code and Iwata instinctively understanding what they were describing to him because of his experience from years ago, even though he didn't code anymore at the time.
3953848	3959270	God, I, now I'm really gonna get shit for bringing this up, but I have to.
3959270	3963911	I'm sorry, I apologize in advance profusely, but I have to.
3963911	3965352	When you talk about that- I will-
3966243	3969025	What?
3969025	3974050	Say that that goes actually with a lot of people who have done code in the past.
3974050	3976191	They understand the logic behind it.
3976191	3976412	Yes.
3977776	4007562	but there's one CEO out there who is an absolute dullard, who thinks they know code, who thinks they know all this shit, and has been called out multiple time and time again at not knowing shit about shit, and literally someone whose entire enterprise has been built on thoughts and prayers, and who has somehow, to this point, been successful, but now they're about to finally fucking lose big, and you nailed it DarkSakura, it's Elon Musk.
4009380	4023487	who doesn't know shit from shit and has literally had to have things explained to him and he'll still go, yeah, no, we're gonna do it this way because I heard about it on a podcast or whatever the fucking weed spirit told him.
4023487	4026909	And when he hallucinated weed spirit.
4026909	4033913	I'm pretty certain if I recall right that of all the Tesla patents, he only created one and it was for a valve.
4036249	4039131	Anyway, sorry, I don't mean to turn this into that podcast.
4039131	4051520	But I had to say it because I'm sorry, when when I was reading that bit about Iwata, all I could see in my mind was the dullard who can't do it, but is somehow still successful at least until now.
4051520	4053442	And that's that guy.
4053442	4055803	Anyway, on to other subjects.
4056843	4059964	Let's talk about mods in games.
4059964	4060804	Mods are evil.
4060804	4061804	OK, that's right.
4061804	4063225	Mods are evil.
4063225	4064425	They're terrible.
4064425	4065165	No, they're not.
4065165	4066506	But there's an interest.
4066506	4066906	What?
4066906	4068006	Yeah.
4068006	4072067	So it's just the I think people are twisting this out of proportion.
4072067	4080049	So there's a video that came out talking about Resident Evil or it's basically not necessarily Resident Evil.
4080049	4080829	It's from Capcom.
4080829	4082550	It's talking about like how
4083817	4096085	They, for the purpose of anti-cheat and anti-piracy, they said, you know, when they're talking about developing those tools, they say that all mods are defined as cheats.
4096085	4101009	Unless they're officially supported or created internally or something like that.
4101009	4104731	So, I think what they mean by that is necessarily that they're
4106584	4111349	You know, there's no way to discern, you know, different mods from the other.
4111349	4115433	So they have to treat it all kind of blanketly as like a cheat in the game.
4115433	4118596	I don't know if they're necessarily like stopping mods.
4118596	4121639	I know for a fact that, you know, they've had some mods.
4121639	4123821	Let's let's be let's be real clear on that.
4123821	4125142	You're never going to stop mods.
4125202	4126122	No, no, no.
4126122	4137687	But like there's they've had some issues like recently with a Street Fighter tournament that they had a nude mod for Chun-Li on there for some reason.
4137687	4139487	Yes, that was not a good look.
4139487	4140488	How did that?
4140488	4141828	How did that get slipped through?
4141828	4146850	Like that's I mean.
4146850	4149211	But yes, it should not have come through during a tournament.
4149211	4150031	It was inappropriate.
4150999	4151399	No.
4151399	4152580	Yeah.
4152580	4165209	Um, so obviously I think they're concerned with certain things, you know, that mods can do, but that they say they can hurt game development.
4165209	4165789	Sure.
4165789	4174895	I mean, I guess, especially if you're talking about the online game and actual cheating, maybe, but like, I think for like swapping skins out, probably not.
4174895	4178878	I mean, I don't think there's really any problem with that.
4178878	4178978	Um,
4181076	4182037	I don't know.
4182037	4183178	Here's the thing.
4183178	4198208	When you talk about the first half of that, where you're talking about that mods at base value have to be seen as cheats when it comes to some of these systems, that actually isn't like a hot take that's different from most of the rest of the industry.
4198208	4200869	Just look at trophies and Steam achievements and the way they work.
4200869	4210576	And I'll even say Bethesda, say, like if you use mods with Skyrim, you know, and granted some of this is like official, it shuts off the mods.
4210956	4218860	because you've, you know, modified the game and you could be using a mod that gives you unlimited lives or, you know, something that basically changes the conditions of winning the trophy.
4218860	4229426	So, like, at, like, face value, the whole, we have to view the mod as a cheat, no matter what the mod is for these types, like, I actually understand that part of it.
4230126	4233468	But then it's that second half where they start to lose me.
4233468	4252817	Yeah, I think it's more of like if, for example, they're doing anti-cheat stuff and what it's going to be is like, OK, to access online services, we are going to say, if you're running a mod, you can't do that because we can't determine whatever mod or exploit thing that you have going.
4252817	4255358	Is this just swapping out the
4256451	4263713	You know, removing the clothes of Chun-Li, or is this making it so that, like, I can do one-button specials or something like that, you know, in the game?
4263713	4265153	Like, what is it?
4265153	4274676	So, since there's no easy way to discern all that, then they just have to basically treat them all the same when it comes to developing anti-cheat.
4276601	4285903	TigerClaw in chat bringing up an excellent point about the importance of mods, saying, if I recall, there have been mods that eventually become a full game.
4285903	4292885	Oh, you're absolutely right, because you know who got notorious at doing this was Valve, and Team Fortress is an excellent example of that.
4292885	4295866	Team Fortress 2, where's Team Fortress 1?
4295866	4296586	It was a Quake mod.
4297540	4304786	Valve got those folks to make a separate game called Team Fortress 2 or even look at something at Dota 2.
4304786	4306748	That was Defense of the Ancients.
4306748	4307868	Where's Dota 1?
4307868	4309069	It's within Warcraft 3.
4309069	4310451	It's a mod.
4310451	4316375	And that led to another kind of messy situation because then Blizzard made their own Dota.
4317276	4322077	and they ended up calling it Heroes of the Storm, which we just talked about earlier in the show, funny enough.
4322077	4324658	But that just goes to show absolutely right.
4324658	4328338	Mods are important because sometimes the new games are born from that.
4328338	4334640	I want to say Portal, to some extent, lends its creation to modding.
4334640	4338941	What's in Counter-Strike, like a mod for Half-Life or something like that?
4338941	4340321	Yeah, I believe so.
4340321	4342181	I am going to beg to differ about Portal.
4342181	4343662	OK, I thought it was.
4344842	4349545	It began its life as a student project called Narbacular Drop.
4365416	4394897	but just to just to kind of point out there that you know you're right a lot of mods become a really big deal and become their own thing for sure um and then DarkSakura had mentioned in chat i blame the high res mods for mass effect 3 uh inspiring the legendary edition um yeah absolutely like you know um a lot of people were using those mods to make the game look more impressive on their you know 4k systems and so forth or even 1080 so um yeah yeah mods are important so
4396161	4402066	Alright, let's move on to a very interesting acquisition that happened within the industry this week.
4402066	4419422	We've been talking a bit about this studio this year because they put out, you know, again, in this year of just banger releases, this studio put out a title that is really fucking good and unfortunately is getting slept on and is not getting the recognition it deserves.
4419422	4421884	And that is Digital Eclipse and their release of
4422324	4424605	the making of Karateka or Karateka.
4424605	4429826	However, you know, apparently Jordan Mechner does not care how you pronounce it as long as you're buying it.
4429826	4435628	So but that is that was a great, you know, just again, the way that was whole set up in the story that was told.
4435628	4436508	That's a great title.
4436508	4441610	And unfortunately, I think a lot of people are sleeping on that release because there's just a lot of stuff to play right now.
4441610	4448592	What's going to be interesting to see what comes of Digital Eclipse and their future releases because Atari bought them.
4449380	4456906	That's right, Atari, the company who 10 years ago was talking about hotels, is now purchasing studios.
4456906	4460549	They're making some very interesting moves.
4460549	4467214	CEO Wade Rosen talking about Digital Eclipse saying, quote, Digital Eclipse is the best in the world at what they do.
4467214	4474300	They have a deep love and respect for the history of the games industry and are renowned for developing critically acclaimed projects based on historic franchises.
4474720	4479482	Digital Eclipse, along with Night Dive, are in perfect alignment with Atari's DNA and renewed purpose.
4479482	4483784	I'm personally excited to see where we can push the boundaries of innovation together.
4483784	4492128	Andrew Eyer from Digital Eclipse, CEO, said, Atari and Digital Eclipse share the same ethos when it comes to celebration and preservation of gaming history.
4492128	4501692	It's an exciting combination and I am confident this will serve Digital Eclipse and our fans extremely well as we grow our business and expand our capabilities.
4502492	4522083	a lot of people pointing to the fact that before the making of Karateka, Digital Eclipse put out that Atari 50 collection, which maybe didn't tell a cohesive story as well, but certainly it was good and it brought that engine that Karateka ended up using.
4522083	4525125	And in a comment, Creative Director Mike Mika from Digital Eclipse said,
4525425	4529409	Our experience collaborating on Atari 50 was revelatory.
4529409	4536395	The trust that Atari showed our team and our clear mutual love and respect for the content positioned us to produce something truly remarkable.
4536395	4542041	I know Atari will continue to champion our approach and that we will be bringing fans exciting new projects for years to come.
4543092	4545413	It's an interesting team up.
4545413	4554016	And at first, you know, I think some of us might have that reaction of, ew, Atari, but Atari's been kind of a sinking ship.
4554016	4558518	I feel like Atari's been on this weird course correction for the past couple years.
4559298	4564262	And Atari's really starting to lean into this retro thing.
4564262	4577274	And Quest Buster is calling out a post that I made on Blue Sky saying, as Rob mentioned last week, if Atari leans into this retro oriented focus to champion things like Digital Eclipse's work, I'm all for it, too.
4577274	4581877	And, you know, there's been a lot of talk in the industry just last week.
4581877	4584880	We had the former president of Sony America talking about
4587045	4588107	Game Preservation
4597659	4600640	the king, the queen, the monarch of game preservation.
4600640	4605021	The company that you think of when it comes to retro game preservation.
4605021	4608262	And I feel like that's how they're positioning themselves.
4608262	4620185	And now they've been making a lot of, and again, I realized they've made a lot of weird decisions in the last decade with the hotels, even though I would have loved to stay in an Atari hotel, but we all know that was a losing proposition.
4620185	4625327	There's the Atari VCS, which we all know was not a great system.
4626147	4640415	But Atari's been making these interesting partnerships through places like Arcade1Up, through places like Digital Eclipse, through pla- Ooh, I wonder if Atari buys Arcade1Up.
4640415	4642897	Hmm.
4642897	4645158	I wonder if Atari buys Arcade1Up.
4646400	4646480	I'm
4664068	4665510	if it doesn't happen, I never said anything.
4665510	4678244	No, but in all seriousness, I think Atari, I think Atari may be positioning themselves as this sort of like retro fun company.
4678244	4684492	But I think they also realize the Atari thing is only going to carry them so far.
4685834	4690155	And there's gonna need to come this thing to reinvent some of these franchises.
4690155	4694257	And Digital Clips and Atari 50 kinda tried to do some of that.
4694257	4698758	I didn't think the Haunted House thing was that great, but I applaud the effort, sure.
4698758	4702440	And I actually think the game in Karateka, the...
4703820	4715264	The remake of that was good, and the other game that Jordan Mechner did, the Cosmic Space Game, the remake they did of that was really good, considering the source material and what they had to work with.
4715264	4719586	I think they do hit it out of the park sometimes.
4719586	4719946	So it's...
4721769	4722409	I don't know.
4722409	4722989	I don't know why.
4722989	4725890	I just I have this very interesting feeling.
4725890	4729491	Atari has figured out their MO.
4729491	4735272	And that is this retro market that maybe needs to go beyond.
4735272	4735632	Thank you.
4735632	4736412	It was death bounce.
4736412	4737833	Thank you, DarkTestia.
4737833	4744714	That goes beyond just things from the Atari 2600 days, but starts with that.
4744714	4745335	I don't know.
4745335	4746055	It's interesting.
4746055	4746835	It's interesting.
4746835	4747075	We'll see.
4748308	4753693	Yeah, and quite frankly, I don't want to see Atari fail, so I think this is interesting.
4753693	4760339	This is one where I'm like, okay, I'm happy to announce Atari seems to be moving in a good direction.
4760339	4761860	So let's see what happens.
4761860	4767385	By the way, Digital Eclipse put out an FAQ, and you know the question everybody had was,
4768126	4773289	does this screw the gold master collection into only being about Atari titles from here on out?
4773289	4785716	And they have said, essentially, no, they said no in kind of a really roundabout way that I didn't think they had to say it that made it sound like the games we have planned will continue on.
4785716	4794061	But after that, who knows, but it does sound like there will be more gold master games that are non Atari games, which is good.
4794061	4795222	So be weird.
4796107	4813856	Pixelpacas also points out, hmm, interesting, that reminds me, a few years ago, Atari invested heavily in AntStream, a retro cloud-based streaming company, if you forgot, and bought MobiGames, big online repository of retro stuff.
4813856	4820259	Yeah, they were super difficult to get my Pixelpoops 2 description thing going.
4820259	4824782	That alignment of MobiGames and Digital Eclipse?
4824782	4825122	Huh.
4826758	4828700	Huh.
4828700	4832863	Atari, I'm willing to license my game for dirt cheap, just so you know.
4832863	4836305	That's all you put it out on different platforms.
4836305	4838407	Wouldn't that be you'd sell it for poop?
4838407	4838647	All right.
4838647	4839528	Anyway, forget it.
4839528	4840669	I'd sell it for poop.
4840669	4840849	Yeah.
4841860	4870284	and Bobby Blackwell points out Atari age the homebrew community is I don't know there's a lot to chew on here but I hope to continue to see this kind of inertia I don't know what changed at Atari but I'm into it so let's see where this you know I hope I don't have to eat because there's it is fully possible I'll be eating those fucking words in a couple years time and that's fine if I have to but so far I'm encouraged by what I see especially compared to you know 10 years ago so we'll see
4871428	4873950	All right, moving on.
4873950	4877572	Less encouraging news for Nintendo Switch owners, right, Loki?
4877572	4884838	Yeah, I didn't realize they even have this app, but apparently the Twitch app on the Nintendo Switch is getting polled.
4884838	4900409	Apparently it didn't work great to begin with anyways, because you weren't able to see chats during streams, you weren't able to subscribe to creators, and obviously you couldn't broadcast to Twitch from the app, because there's no way that that would work.
4902343	4914420	The app will be ending support on November 6th, and existing users will lose access to the app starting January 31st, 2024.
4916263	4920065	So if you want the app, you literally better download it tonight live.
4920065	4924107	And I'm sorry to the podcast listeners, but it may already be gone if you want it.
4924107	4928529	But honestly, it's it's not it's not good.
4928529	4931450	And I actually I brought it up on my switch to show you.
4931450	4935933	So it starts off kind of looking like a normal kind of Twitch app, right?
4935933	4937934	It kind of starts off looking like that.
4937934	4940415	But then when you actually go in to like watch a stream,
4941115	4946981	So you actually can see, okay, I want to go in, I want to watch live or whatever I'm doing there.
4946981	4953248	But then if you want to join the chat, you have to actually click a button that says join the conversation.
4953248	4959274	Because when you go in to watch live, you don't actually see any sort of like chat.
4960015	4960895	Thank you for watching!
4977603	4978324	Subpar App
4993960	5000282	Bobby Blackwell says, honestly, the Twitch app for the Switch behaved exactly the same as the other console apps, so I'm kind of perplexed by this.
5000282	5003843	There was an update on other consoles that also removes chatting from them.
5003843	5005803	It points you to use your mobile device.
5005803	5008684	Oh, I wasn't aware of that because I haven't used the Xbox app in a little while.
5008684	5011285	That is the Nintendo MO.
5011285	5014225	I mean, let alone probably everybody else's MO as well, too.
5014225	5015966	But just use those mobile devices.
5016266	5022597	But I will point out you are missing the biggest thing that the Xbox app has that the Switch doesn't.
5022597	5025262	The ability to stream from your console.
5025262	5026404	That's still in there, right?
5026404	5028227	Because that's that would be the differentiator.
5031981	5035544	So honestly, I really don't think this is a big deal.
5035544	5044451	And even as somebody who uses Twitch and would like to have more viewers on Twitch from wherever possible, I'm like, I get it.
5044451	5045852	The Switch isn't the best place for it.
5047830	5049050	There it is.
5049050	5050391	All right.
5050391	5057433	Yeah, SheHulk10 says the Xbox app sucks for Twitch, completely broken, unprofessional.
5057433	5061594	And SJMats100mat says, yeah, the Xbox series Twitch app isn't that great.
5061594	5064674	I use it for watching the show tonight, but it's behind the usual stream.
5064674	5068795	Interesting, because I've used it to watch streams before, like while I'm downstairs in the kitchen and stuff.
5068795	5069656	But you're right.
5069656	5070436	All it is, like,
5070956	5072437	full screen on the TV.
5072437	5073738	I'm not participating.
5073738	5075639	Like it's just it's just there.
5075639	5083023	Like watching CNN in the background or something would be it's just things that are more interesting and not as depressing.
5083023	5085345	So, all right.
5085345	5087626	Anyhow, let's move on.
5087626	5090588	And talk about our next story, Loki.
5090588	5091649	All right, it's me.
5091649	5093050	Just kidding.
5093050	5094250	Right?
5094250	5095271	Yes, it is you.
5095271	5096472	Okay.
5096472	5096732	Sorry.
5098430	5101812	I'm lost tonight because we're in a different rotation tonight, but that's all right.
5101812	5103293	Okay, hi.
5103293	5120925	Xbox is going to be blocking unauthorized third-party accessories because, yeah, you know, there's a lot of cheap Xbox merchandise that's sold, which, you know, if you tend to break your Xbox merchandise, cheap merchandise might sound pretty appealing.
5120925	5123647	And let's be real, $70 for a controller is a lot of money.
5124447	5128489	However, Microsoft plans to put an end to the third-party unlicensed stuff.
5128489	5133771	It's not to say there won't be some third-party stuff, but they plan to put an end to the unauthorized third-party stuff.
5133771	5141974	You will get an error code that says, we encourage you to contact the store or manufacturer where you obtained the accessory with getting help to returning it.
5141974	5144975	Now, whereas I think at first,
5146010	5154495	I could kind of see why they're trying to get some knockoffs and things like that out of the market because there is a lot of like cheap shit out there and it's very obviously cheap.
5154495	5160598	Unfortunately, what this does, it has a ripple effect that's a little shadier.
5160598	5170524	And that is that, you know, things like these fighting sticks that are custom for tournaments that people have spent a lot of money in making will essentially become a third party.
5171945	5182734	Accessibility is becoming a big one as well, because yes, there is a great Xbox accessibility controller, but apparently they're not exactly easy to find.
5182734	5186116	And, you know, sometimes, you know, in short supply and what have you.
5186116	5194964	And so, you know, folks come up with their own sorts of accessibility devices, and those are currently being recognized as a third party device.
5195564	5207512	So considering they're threatening to pull the plug on some of this stuff on November 12th, Microsoft may have a little bit of back to the drawing board to do on this because it sounds like they could, I suppose, throw the baby out with the bathwater.
5207512	5223123	I don't like that expression, but it seems to be the one that fits here because they're basically going to, you know, get rid of these good uses of modified controllers along with, you know, the cheap shit that they're trying to, you know, not have associated with Xbox, essentially.
5224924	5237572	Now, Microsoft did give a statement to Eurogamer on this, saying, quote, Microsoft and other licensed Xbox hardware partners' accessories are designed and manufactured with quality standards for performance, security, and safety.
5237572	5242195	Unauthorized accessories can compromise the gaming experience on Xbox consoles.
5242195	5245697	Gamers may receive a pop-up warning that their accessory is unauthorized.
5245697	5250379	Eventually, the unauthorized accessory will be blocked from use to preserve the console gaming experience.
5251761	5273437	It just reinforces what we pretty much already got from the pop-up, is that they're trying to block the cheap shit so that cheap shit doesn't get associated with, um... It's not only that though, it's also some of these, like, um... Things that allow you to use keyboard mouse in games that don't allow that.
5273437	5276119	So that it's basically, um...
5278931	5285335	It's a way for them to try to even the playing field there a little bit, but yeah, it sucks.
5286007	5286988	Yeah.
5286988	5288249	So, but it'll be interesting.
5288249	5301740	I mean, if, you know, especially now that charities like AbleGamers are getting involved, which we were just talking about them not that long ago, because the Games Done Quick Express event at TwitchCon was raising money for AbleGamers.
5301740	5305863	So, and, you know, this is part of the advocacy that they provide.
5305863	5309847	AbleGamers is now kind of coming out and saying, Microsoft needs to rethink this.
5310427	5315431	It will be interesting to see if Phil Spencer comes in and saves the day on this one too.
5315431	5322798	Literally another thing that was going around in our Discord this week, which I encourage you to check out, vognetwork.com slash Discord, and join the conversation throughout the week.
5322798	5329543	Folks were sharing an article about how Xbox employees were apparently losing access to Game Pass, and they were really sad about that.
5329543	5334167	Well, Phil Spencer came in and said, you shouldn't, you should get to keep that.
5334167	5334828	And, you know,
5335288	5336609	fixed it, basically.
5336609	5338951	Literally costs them like nothing.
5338951	5340392	Like, yeah, essentially.
5340392	5345835	Now, not everything should be something that requires Phil Spencer to come in and fix.
5345835	5348417	He doesn't have that kind of time.
5348417	5356302	But I think if gamers know, especially a organization like AbleGamers knows, that's the way to get it to change.
5356302	5358944	I think there's gonna be a lot of people in his ear this week.
5358944	5359945	So we'll see what comes to that.
5361246	5369111	All right, anyhow, let's travel back to a time when there was a lot of third party stuff out there authorized and unauthorized.
5369111	5371752	We're gonna take a trip back down memory lane in this next segment.
5371752	5372593	Let me play the clip.
5383246	5390991	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5390991	5393973	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5393973	5400237	But once a month, DarkSakura actually picks a classic non-video game.
5400237	5402198	So what did you pick for us this week, DarkSakura?
5403559	5416221	I picked Guess Who, which is a board game where you guess the identity of the character that someone else has chosen on their side.
5416221	5422442	It was developed by Israeli game inventors Ora and Theo Koster.
5422442	5428704	They're known collectively as Theodora Design, and it was manufactured by Milton Bradley in 1979, now owned by Hasbro.
5431544	5436169	The game was first brought to the UK by Jack Barr Sr.
5436169	5437911	in 1982.
5437911	5445038	Classic edition is currently being produced by Winning Moves Games, USA.
5445038	5453726	The game was initially published in 1979 and it's for two players.
5456048	5468973	Basically, you start with a board that has cartoon images of 24 people and their first names and all the images stand up like we're seeing in the video for those who are watching on Twitch.
5468973	5477336	The objective of the game is be the first to determine which one's cards is the right person to guess.
5477336	5479097	So you play yes or no questions.
5480317	5482398	such as, does a person wear a hat?
5482398	5483698	Do they wear glasses?
5483698	5484619	Are they male?
5484619	5486119	Are they, you know, female?
5486119	5487499	Etc.
5487499	5495262	And then you eliminate the candidates by flipping the image down until only one is left.
5495262	5498783	So, of course, there are special editions of this.
5498783	5502244	There are Star Wars, Marvel Comics, Disney,
5503264	5516673	Travel Edition with 20 faces, 2008 and 2010, there are extra mix and match games, and there was a computer game that was released in 1999 by Hasbro.
5516673	5518074	It looks terrible.
5518074	5519735	I did find the video of it.
5522697	5525359	So sorry.
5525359	5533385	But in the US, of course, advertisements had the characters coming to life on their card and making comments with each other.
5533385	5545894	And of course, this made it put a statement that the cards, the game cards do not actually talk.
5545894	5546595	I remember that.
5546595	5547455	It's so funny.
5547455	5548396	Yeah.
5548396	5549016	Ridiculous.
5550857	5556878	There is a belief that a binary search is the most efficient approach to the game.
5556878	5563180	It halves your identities, basically.
5563180	5572682	People are trying to combine them by asking multiple things in one.
5572682	5573142	However,
5576607	5577927	I believe that's not in the rules.
5577927	5592232	You have to ask one item and then, like, instead of saying, do they have, like, red hair or glasses and the, or this, you just have to ask, do they have this?
5593641	5602004	Now, the big thing about the game is that there is a big lack of diversity in the game.
5610028	5615333	up to five female characters against 19 male.
5615333	5620918	There were people who were not of different ethnicities.
5620918	5634251	The company wrote, and this is a quote, the intended to draw attention away from using gender or ethnicity as the focal point and concentrate on things that we all have in common rather than focus on differences.
5635985	5653623	However, it was responded that the whole point of the game is to recognize people's difference and that gender was recognized as a female gender was recognized as a characteristic while male gender is not.
5655703	5668827	which again just goes back to the general society patriarchal view that the default is white cisgender male.
5668827	5680111	So the original version of Guess Who had one non-white character named Anne who was redrawn subsequently as a white woman
5681271	5689999	But since then, the game has been redesigned to characters to be more diverse.
5689999	5704652	There was an unscripted television adaptation of the game that was in development at NBC and will be produced by Endemol Shine North America Entertainment One.
5704652	5706213	So that's in the plans.
5706213	5707954	We'll see if that actually happens.
5708876	5713664	And there was a giant-sized guess who.
5713664	5720676	So, there, um, are... I'm glad to see that, um...
5722591	5722951	Guess Who?
5722951	5725672	is still produced by Theora Design in Israel.
5744757	5761768	along with a few other games they have called Jewel Hunt where you have to close the spaces with multicolored playing pieces and you know almost like a kind of a domino thing Tortolotto and a game called Triggle of course Guess Who is still there
5762929	5767893	and a game about balancing books.
5767893	5774299	You have to stack up books so that the upper shelf lines evenly across the top.
5774299	5777762	It's called makore in Hebrew.
5777762	5784288	So they're still making games, but guess who is the biggest export?
5784288	5784849	So there you go.
5786058	5792764	All right, thank you for pushing through to bring us the classic non-video game of the month, Guess Who?
5792764	5798469	I'm sure a game that I'd be surprised if some of y'all out there haven't played this game at some point in your life.
5798469	5802492	So, yeah, it's definitely an iconic title.
5802492	5806196	I kind of want to do the Guess Who of Drag.
5807038	5808519	I'm sure somebody's made it.
5808519	5811920	I'm sure like if you check on YouTube, I'm sure somebody's made it.
5811920	5818061	So yeah, but I also kind of want to do the guess who of Twitch personalities.
5818061	5820942	That might be a fun thing to bring to TwitchCon next year.
5820942	5822583	Maybe, maybe.
5822583	5823303	All right.
5823303	5828824	Let's check out some other news by traveling around the gaming world and checking out some other news rapidly.
5828824	5830425	So we will go to Loki.
5831380	5839445	Yes, let's talk about what's going to be your free with monthly subscription stuff coming to Xbox and PlayStation.
5839445	5842867	So for November, we've got a few things.
5842867	5853513	So coming to Game Pass, we've got Headbangers, Rhythm Royale, Juice Ants, Wartales, Thirsty Suitors, Football Manager 2024.
5855174	5859697	Dungeons 4, LaikaDragonGaiden, the man who erased his name.
5859697	5860818	That's exciting.
5860818	5866221	Wild Hearts, Spirity, and Coral Island.
5866221	5868522	Those are all coming.
5868522	5877928	Leaving is going to be Coffee Talk, Exapunks, Ghost Song, GungraveGore, FootballManager2023.
5877928	5882151	I mean, after all, we've got to replace it with a new version.
5882151	5883892	Lappin and Townscaper.
5886351	5892017	And then, PlayStation Plus is getting a few games as well.
5892017	5908532	So, first off, they've got Fireteam Elite, and we've also got, let's see, Mafia 2 Definitive Edition for PlayStation 4, as well as Dragon Ball The Breakers for PlayStation 4.
5910629	5911489	How exciting.
5911489	5916650	Not not a great lineup, to be honest, for November, which is a big video game sales month.
5916650	5917991	I just just something I noticed.
5917991	5922392	I mean, call me a hater, but I don't know.
5922392	5923332	Yeah.
5923332	5935255	And they're all not really well rated either because they apparently both aliens and mafia rated like a five point five.
5935255	5940036	And then, you know, the other game about like a five
5943040	5943881	Yay!
5943881	5945323	Scraping that bottom of the barrel.
5947355	5954562	Something probably not coming to PlayStation, but certainly looks like it could, is Bloodborne Kart.
5954562	5971457	It is a Bloodborne demake kart racing game that is, I'm assuming, for PC, but it looks like it's straight from the PlayStation 1, and it will be coming out January 31st next year, out for free.
5972558	5986827	Assuming it doesn't get shut down and cease to exist, but it looks funny and it's well put together, so it's a mashup that you never thought you needed.
5986827	5987147	All right.
5988424	6000266	Well, the game that has kept on giving and giving for the Nintendo Switch over the last few years, honestly, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has one more booster course pack on the way, and it is coming out November 9th, this next week.
6000266	6001387	This is the last one.
6001387	6005988	So all 48 additional courses that were added to the game will now be available.
6005988	6012129	That means 96 courses across all of the content they've released, including what was on Kart and all that from the beginning.
6012929	6021896	Wave 6 will feature the Acorn Cup and the Spiny Cup Tour Rome Avanti GCN DK Mountain Wii Daisy Circuit Piranha Plant Cove
6034985	6037806	Tour Madrid, also from Mario Kart Tour.
6037806	6042206	3DS, Rosalina's Ice World from, of course, 3DS Mario Kart.
6042206	6045547	SNES, Bowser Castle 3, I'll let you guess what that's from.
6045547	6049428	And Wii, Rainbow Road, because you needed yet another Rainbow Road.
6049428	6051088	I think you have all of them now.
6051088	6052848	Yeah, I think you really do.
6052848	6054869	Also, don't forget, there's new racers with this.
6054869	6062850	That means Diddy Kong is coming to the game and Funky Kong are also coming to the game, as well as Pauline and Peachette.
6063851	6068137	all coming from Mario Kart Tour crossing over into Mario Kart 8.
6068137	6076571	So they're really trying to salvage everything they can from Mario Kart Tour into Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or the game people bought.
6076571	6077132	So there is that.
6078410	6079531	I can't believe that game.
6079531	6082452	Maybe we can finally talk about Mario Kart 9.
6082452	6088215	Isn't that going to be interesting that essentially the Switch got no dedicated Mario Kart game?
6088215	6092237	I know, I know, but Mario Kart 8 was a Wii U game.
6092237	6102783	Yes, it really found its full life on the Switch, and obviously it's so much bigger than what it was before at a price, depending if you pay for Nintendo Online or not.
6103283	6108525	But I think it's it's interesting that the Switch essentially got no dedicated Mario Kart game.
6108525	6110646	So it will be very interesting to see.
6110646	6115327	Could the successor get a Mario Kart game as a launch title?
6115327	6116087	Wouldn't that be so?
6116087	6116407	I don't know.
6116407	6117728	Maybe I'm maybe I'm.
6117728	6119709	I mean, there's rumors.
6119709	6122850	There's been rumors about it for a long time.
6122850	6128271	Yeah, I was going to say it wasn't a kind of a launch title, though, for the Switch, ironically.
6128271	6129472	Ironically, yes, it was.
6130831	6137215	I don't know if it was day and date, but it was it was not day and date, but it was the first couple of months.
6137215	6139557	Yeah, it was the first six months for sure.
6139557	6148122	Because I remember they didn't have really strong Switch titles at launch, and then that came out and that was kind of their launch lead.
6148122	6149663	Well, no, I wouldn't say they didn't have.
6149663	6150384	They had Zelda.
6150384	6151845	You're forgetting a little Zelda game.
6151845	6153586	Yeah, but I get what you mean.
6153586	6154406	Besides that.
6154406	6154947	Yeah.
6154947	6155727	Besides Zelda.
6155727	6156668	Yeah.
6156668	6156808	So.
6157438	6158458	All right.
6158458	6162580	Well, let's travel around and check out what releases you can buy this week.
6162580	6167042	And since, again, we're leading right up until Black Friday, I expect it's a busy week.
6167042	6169622	What do we got, Loki?

6581170	6582290	All right.
6582290	6587252	Well, we have a few more stories for you, and then we will get to the listener roundtable.
6587252	6590994	But first, let's do some stories from Loki.
6590994	6598777	Yeah, let's talk about how that Five Nights at Freddy's movie did, and it did well, despite some of the negative reviews for it.
6598777	6599577	I liked it.
6599577	6604980	But, you know, my opinion is totally determined in how the box office does.
6604980	6607101	And because I liked it, it did well, right?
6607101	6607881	You know, that's how it works.
6608867	6615610	Apparently, though, it did have the biggest opening weekend of the year for a horror movie.
6615610	6621753	It was the second largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation behind Super Mario Bros.
6621753	6622974	Movie.
6622974	6628577	The biggest opening weekend ever for Universal and Peacock hybrid release.
6628577	6634559	The highest grossing opening weekend for Halloween weekend release.
6634559	6637521	And the third biggest debut for any horror film.
6640829	6641971	I mean that's pretty good.
6641971	6648560	Best debut ever for a PG-13 horror film and highest grossing Blumhouse global opening of all time.
6648560	6653367	Not to mention that they had like I think a budget of 25 million dollars and they've made
6654707	6657191	Thank you for watching!
6671211	6676117	E3VL is pointing out though, huge drop second week though, good overall numbers though.
6676117	6688032	Well I would bet the huge drop was now you see the on-demand kicking in because the people, like there were people that were like, oh we're gonna rush out, get it on the big screen and see it there and do that sort of thing and then you know.
6688773	6691354	E3DL says, to be fair, not a lot of people have Peacock.
6691354	6693955	Is Comcast still not, are they not giving it away anymore?
6693955	6694895	Because they were at some point.
6694895	6699496	They are, they are for, well, they, they, it's weird.
6699496	6706498	So they were offering it for free and then they took it away and then they brought it back again, like within a month.
6706498	6711299	Because I remember, like, I had it through Comcast and they're like, okay, we're taking away.
6711299	6712320	I'm like, fine, I'll pay for it.
6712320	6712680	That's fine.
6713801	6717586	And then they're like, oh, haha, it's like we're going to give back to you.
6717586	6718767	It's like, OK, thanks.
6718767	6720109	Interesting.
6720109	6724675	Yeah, they were switching it like they had like a different thing that they were switching.
6724675	6725716	Now they're including it with.
6726916	6728036	Thank you for watching!
6745515	6750202	I mean, we still have we pay for TV, but we don't use the TV part of it.
6750202	6752565	So we weren't using it either.
6752565	6753867	So yeah.
6753867	6755870	Anyway, it is funny because they keep panicking.
6755870	6758114	They're like, your box is not updated.
6758114	6760757	You're not going to be able to like watch on demand stuff through your box.
6760757	6760958	I'm like.
6762701	6763342	Thank you for watching!
6786533	6795155	And then we have news of Fortnite Chapter 4 doing quite well because it's basically Fortnite Classic.
6795155	6802497	Bringing back the classic map and the classic weapons and gameplay of the first release of Fortnite.
6802497	6805578	And that went live last week and...
6806741	6810684	Yeah, so that's good to hear, I guess.
6810684	6820733	Not so good considering their recent layoff of almost 1,000 employees, but, you know, still seems to be shooting up in the popularity.
6820733	6835445	Even had Ninja playing some, you know, over the weekend on Twitch, so... Wow, they hit 12 million concurrent players recently, so that's pretty awesome.
6837230	6839732	Do they still have a no-build mode even though they went back to classic?
6839732	6842974	Or did they take that out because of the classic?
6842974	6844274	No-build mode's the only thing I like.
6844274	6845475	I don't like to play the regular format.
6845475	6847717	I don't know, but I would assume they do.
6850474	6869441	One more story here and it's about Ubisoft games and this is a server shutdown story which means if you are still playing some old old games online you may not be able to much longer but you probably aren't playing these games online which is why they're pulling the servers.
6873122	6881287	the wide collection of Assassin's Creed, well four, four Assassin's Creed games getting pulled on January 25th, 2024.
6881287	6891553	Assassin's Creed 2 for the 360, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood for the Mac, Assassin's Creed Liberation HD for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and Assassin's Creed Revelations for PC.
6891553	6895516	Now keep in mind, I don't have in front of me what platforms they may have already pulled.
6895516	6899959	These are just the platforms we know are confirmed that are getting pulled on January 25th.
6901159	6914456	Ghost Recon Future Soldier for PC, Heroes of Might and Magic 6 for PC, NCIS for PC, Splinter Cell Conviction on Xbox 360, RUSE for PC, and Trials Evolution for PC
6917376	6937213	Once the online features are shut off, you will no longer be able to play online multiplayer, you cannot link accounts, and you cannot get the Ubisoft Connect rewards for these titles.
6937213	6941938	It is interesting, of course, that like, for example, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is being shut down on Mac.
6942398	6960657	3.6.0
6960797	6963880	Sony tried to kill the PlayStation 3 store at this point.
6963880	6966782	So, you know, it's not too surprising.
6966782	6972607	So but it does suck for game preservation, you know, and being able to have that online experience and so forth.
6972607	6974509	But we'll see.
6974509	6985339	I guess that's where the evil modders because modding is a crime, apparently to some will come in and send the mod police after you keep those games preserved.
6986260	7005464	Alright, let's go to the listener roundtable where we invite your chat questions, your Discord calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room, and your emails, except I know DarkSakura's voice isn't doing too well tonight, and I already checked the mailbag just to see if maybe I needed to pinch hit, so I can report.
7005464	7006665	There's nothing in there.
7006665	7008145	Except there was spam email.
7008965	7012027	about joining some type of Matchbox 20 insider club.
7012027	7015188	And I was like, what the fuck year is this?
7015188	7015508	1997?
7015508	7018110	Like, why are we being asked?
7018110	7018490	Did they?
7018490	7021111	Did you actually clean out the spam?
7021111	7023833	No.
7023833	7025713	Maybe I'll try to remember later.
7025713	7026094	All right.
7026094	7028415	There could have been more context to that club in there.
7029005	7031087	I'm about to find their big unsubscribe button.
7048459	7058943	We get these emails a lot from a particular company that advertises big names like, big investor you've seen on an ABC television show getting into podcasting and talking about it.
7058943	7068766	And I just sit here and I kind of laugh because I'm like, we've been doing this for so long that I just don't care what his ass thinks about podcasting.
7068766	7070627	Like, could we be bigger?
7070627	7072008	Could we have more listeners?
7072008	7073168	Probably.
7073168	7075509	Have I passed the point where I care?
7075509	7075809	Yeah.
7077253	7079295	You all are here and that's all I need.
7079295	7079775	Yeah.
7079775	7090483	I love you all who tune in here Sunday nights and of course listen throughout the week on the podcast feed and especially those that reach out and say, Hey, I'm listening on the podcast feed.
7090483	7096527	Cause once in a while I'll get pinged on social media on blue sky or like a random email comes in and says, Hey, I heard this thing.
7096527	7097287	You were talking about that.
7097287	7099149	And I'm like, Oh my God, you still listen to the show.
7099149	7099769	I love that.
7099769	7100630	So yeah, I do.
7100630	7102131	I do appreciate you all.
7102131	7103092	But as far as, um,
7104366	7105948	You know, that guy from Shark Tank knows.
7105948	7109052	Oh my god, you were how old when you started listening to us?
7109052	7109673	I know.
7109673	7114379	Don't you love those emails that are like, I was 14 and now I have a 14 year old.
7114379	7115981	It's like, ah!
7118867	7121928	Excuse me while I go take my Geritol and cry.
7121928	7122989	Right.
7122989	7124849	Drink your prune juice.
7124849	7125609	All right.
7125609	7127350	Loki, do you have any last minute stories for us tonight?
7127350	7129631	It is a warrior's drink.
7129631	7131291	I do not.
7131291	7132192	Womp womp.
7132192	7134192	Well, that's depressing.
7134192	7140314	I don't see a lot in chat, but I will point out Tiger Claw was pointing out to you, Loki, that with Xfinity, you don't need the box.
7140314	7141775	You can use Xfinity Stream.
7142695	7144417	which to be fair, I have used them.
7144417	7146399	They're so nice because they don't count that towards your cap.
7146399	7146959	They're so generous.
7163410	7165771	Well, here's the thing, too, which is annoying.
7165771	7169933	On top of that is like they were calling from an on.
7169933	7173415	It was coming over as like they have the caller ID blocked on it.
7173415	7179598	They called me like several times a day, like four to five times a day.
7179598	7181359	And won't leave messages.
7181359	7184821	Oh, oh, is that the 800 number that's been calling me lately?
7184821	7187522	Oh, God, I bet it is them.
7187522	7189303	Not, yeah, so not coming back.
7190655	7193296	Yeah, they they they reek of desperation.
7193296	7194637	Yeah.
7194637	7198339	Let's see some other comments in chat over Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
7198339	7201200	Morifumi in chat says, podcast listener here.
7201200	7202981	Finally have the chance to watch live.
7202981	7204181	Well, thank you so much for being here.
7204181	7204542	Hello.
7204542	7205582	Special shout out for you.
7205582	7205962	Thank you.
7205962	7206242	Welcome.
7206242	7206903	Welcome.
7206903	7209544	Hope you've been enjoying the show tonight.
7209544	7214006	DarkTetsuya is pointing out, MikeDef says, found something on our discord.
7214006	7217108	Apparently Taiko Drum and Fun is getting delisted.
7217108	7217508	Really?
7218288	7228894	I wonder if it's music licensing issues, because that's always what seems to kill these games early is that the music is only licensed for two years, three years, however long it's been.
7228894	7230715	Unfortunately, that's what happens sometimes.
7230715	7237039	So I keep seeing more songs being added to that, that mini DDR machine that I don't need.
7238083	7246769	Yeah, they have, was it Rock Beat, In the Navy, The Race, like a whole bunch of, it's like a lot of licensed songs now.
7246769	7247729	That's great.
7247729	7251172	I don't know if I want one, but I love the concept.
7251172	7255875	It's a neat idea, but like, no, I don't need that.
7255875	7257076	It would be fun.
7257076	7262279	Like, the only reason I would want it is to put an emulator, put Step Mania on it or something like that.
7262279	7265021	But like, there's no real point to do that.
7265021	7267423	Like, there is literally no reason to do that.
7269080	7278003	SSJ100Matt on a different note says we should hear from SAG-AFTRA tomorrow about if they're accepting the studio's quote-unquote best final offer.
7278003	7281364	Isn't this the third final offer the studios have made?
7281364	7282544	Here's the thing.
7282544	7296689	I hope it is a good offer and I hope SAG will accept it, but if it's not a good offer and it doesn't meet what they're looking for and it doesn't get rid of replacing actors with AI, then I fully support SAG-AFTRA kicking it back and saying the strike continues.
7297169	7299670	Don't settle if it's not a fair deal.
7299670	7305693	And definitely don't settle on actor AI stuff, because that that's a huge no.
7305693	7307714	So.
7307714	7308235	But I know.
7308235	7314858	Especially with the whole Scarlett Johansson thing, fighting people like using her likeness for an advertisement.
7314858	7315678	Oh, yeah.
7315678	7318079	Tom Hanks had that same thing happen recently.
7318079	7319620	That's not the movie studios, though.
7319620	7322722	That's that's shit advertisers that are doing.
7322722	7323042	Right.
7323042	7323502	Yeah.
7323502	7324202	I understand that.
7324202	7324863	It is a gross thing.
7326880	7338162	Yeah, it's still just big, you know, it's, you know, if individuals are doing that, you know, studios might go, yeah, that's an interesting idea.
7339028	7343531	It is DarkSakura is calling out fuck the deep fakes, which yeah, that's unfortunately this world we live in.
7343531	7350956	We have to, we have to train our kids how to spot deep fakes like that if we're not already, because that's the kind of world we're living in.
7350956	7353818	Unfortunately, it's just wild.
7353818	7359382	Anyway, um, but yeah, hopefully, hopefully it is the fair deal that SAG-AFTRA was looking for.
7359382	7361803	But if it isn't, they shouldn't settle.
7361803	7364865	But I know there are a lot of actors that would like to get back to work.
7364865	7368608	But also, you know, don't go, don't go back if it's not a fair deal.
7370920	7371726	Alright, um...
7373151	7373851	I guess that's it.
7373851	7375092	We're gonna wrap up.
7375092	7376552	We're gonna get on out of here for the night.
7376552	7380993	Thank you so much for listening to Orange Knowledge Radio and staying up with our show tonight.
7380993	7388475	It might have been a different time for some of you to a daylight savings having ended in the States, which is I hate this time of year because now it gets dark at five o'clock.
7388475	7389575	Some people like it.
7389575	7390576	I don't.
7390576	7397838	I guess it's all right when the Christmas lights start coming on or that those sorts of things, but I'm just not a fan of early nights because it kind of kills my
7399893	7429208	walking you know it's some of the places i like to go walking i don't like to go walking at night so it kind of kills a lot of that so that's all that's my opinion uh anyway that's gonna do it for our show tonight if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange lounge radio please tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice we need more voices to put out here on air so tell a friend or two a nice five star review on a site like itunes spotify or wherever it is you found this show goes an awful long way so we appreciate all of that
7429828	7434991	Um, DarkSakura, I think you said you're gonna stream, but you're gonna stream a little quietly tonight.
7434991	7441354	So I will go to you first if you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight before you head on out.
7441354	7444296	So, um, I'm probably gonna play killer.
7444296	7453400	Um, and but if anybody wants to pop on and play some survivor with me and talk for me, I wouldn't say no.
7453400	7455741	But I'm just gonna play.
7455741	7457042	I'm gonna see what happens.
7457042	7457983	We're gonna be silly.
7457983	7458623	We're gonna vibe.
7459164	7460646	All right, well, have fun doing your thing, Jamie.
7460646	7463328	We'll talk to you later.
7463328	7464910	Hopefully we do get to talk to you again next week.
7464910	7467773	Feel better.
7467773	7469435	All right, well, with that, we'll go to Loki.
7469435	7471337	What's your final thought tonight?
7471337	7479805	My final thought is I'm just gonna be working on more content stuff to keep busy with that.
7479805	7481247	And then, yeah, that's it.
7481894	7483135	Awesome.
7483135	7489358	My final thought, I'm kind of busy this week with personal obligations, but I should be streaming tomorrow.
7489358	7493120	So check that out over on my personal channel, Twitch TV, Rob Roberts.
7493120	7494601	Hopefully a little bit this weekend as well.
7494601	7499503	It's actually only a four-day week for me this week because Veterans Day is observed on Friday.
7499503	7502765	So thank you, veterans, for all that you do.
7502765	7506007	So if we happen to have any that are listening to the show, thank you very much for that.
7506007	7509649	It's not just a holiday, but it is nice to have that for sure, of course.
7510409	7515292	Monday I'll probably be doing something else though, I'm probably going back to Pokemon Scarlet.
7515292	7517793	Just a quick personal note, Shane and I were streaming that game together
7530419	7533501	But for personal reasons, he's let his Nintendo Online go.
7533501	7538844	So he'll probably still be there when I stream it, but we're not going to be playing together.
7538844	7544167	We're just I'm just going to make my way through the rest of the game and beat it already, because I've tried like twice now to get through that game and I haven't yet.
7544167	7545828	So I'd like to beat it.
7545828	7554713	So we'll be probably working on that on Monday and then probably more Diablo, more Mario Wonder and all these other games I got to catch up on because there's just been too much this year.
7555413	7561439	Anyway, thank you all again for listening to our show tonight and hanging with us whether it was on the podcast feed or here live on Twitch.
7561439	7564982	We appreciate you and we hope you all have a wonderful week.
7564982	7568045	We will see you in seven days to do it all again.
7568045	7568926	Until next week.
