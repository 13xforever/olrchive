1
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: As of tomorrow of this recording, your PlayStation controller's share button will get a little less functional.

2
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,901
[SPEAKER_04]: The network where the hashtag came into prominence no longer plays its birdsong and no longer invites everyone to play in its sandbox.

3
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:25,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft stopped supporting shares to the platform months ago, and now Sony is following suit.

4
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:27,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The only good X is the button on video game controllers.

5
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:29,983
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Money Can't Buy Happiness intro.

6
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:35,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Simmers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of this week's gaming news.

7
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:37,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting right now in the show, wherever your gamer has a voice,

8
00:00:39,383 --> 00:00:41,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:56,607
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, live once again tonight with episode number 981 of our show for November the 12th of 2023.

11
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,107
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

12
00:00:58,107 --> 00:01:00,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with you every week as are my co hosts.

13
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:15,754
[SPEAKER_06]: who is not coming through for some reason, but hopefully... I'm not sure what that's all about, but I will jump over and also say hello to TechMasterLuke.

15
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:16,334
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

16
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:17,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Jamie.

17
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:21,978
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

18
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:24,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Dealing with some business.

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,441
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

21
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:29,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I... There's something causing some lag on my system, so it's kind of...

22
00:01:31,058 --> 00:01:35,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, at least I'm happy to hear your voice is sounding a lot better.

23
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:42,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So that seems to indicate that a little bit of therapy with the voice and rest went a long way.

24
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:47,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, as Mike Def says in our chat, good to hear you're doing better now, Jamie.

25
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:47,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

26
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:53,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So all right, well, we'll also go and say hello to Techmaster Loki.

27
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Loki.

28
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:55,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

29
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:55,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

30
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:56,874
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

31
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:57,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing pretty good.

32
00:01:57,836 --> 00:01:58,897
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

33
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:05,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to figure out because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network.

34
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:09,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

35
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:13,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you do watch us live, you get video that can enhance things a little bit.

36
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:22,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're mindful that it's a podcast, but we get a little video fun, and I see there's a game playing behind you tonight that kind of looks like the Incredible Machine to me, but it's not.

37
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something else.

38
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not.

39
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:24,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what is it?

40
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know this one.

41
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:26,204
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ultimate Chicken Horse.

42
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:30,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know this game, but it sounds like it's a fun game.

43
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:31,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

44
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a game I did enjoy.

45
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:39,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of like the Incredible Machine and it's a platformer.

46
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:43,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So the object of the game is it's like a four player party game or I think you multi.

47
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:53,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the limit is, but basically you have a group of people you put down obstacles to either help or hinder yourself to getting to the end.

48
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And the goal is only you get to the end.

49
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:02,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're trying to stop everybody else from getting to the goal in there.

50
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:04,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And if everybody gets to the end, you don't get points.

51
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:07,828
[SPEAKER_05]: If some people get to the end, then some people get points.

52
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,590
[SPEAKER_05]: If everybody gets to the end, then you don't get points.

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you have to make it just the right amount difficult.

54
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:22,837
[SPEAKER_06]: TheBreakMan in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, A game about screwing your friends?

55
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:23,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in.

56
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:30,220
[SPEAKER_06]: In the words of Archer, phrasing screwing over your friends like Mario Party.

57
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

58
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:30,860
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

59
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

60
00:03:32,662 --> 00:03:35,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I want to get into our first topic tonight.

61
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a little bit like different.

62
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:42,913
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm about to talk about is not like the biggest news story of the week by any means.

63
00:03:42,913 --> 00:03:47,098
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reason why this is a little bit front of mind for me is because you know, if you go back,

64
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:54,700
[SPEAKER_06]: and look at the history of this program, you know, and where we, you know, came from 21 years ago when we started this show in June of 2002.

65
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:02,182
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, myself, Loki, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade.

66
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:10,784
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's these different mixes of the machine and our local Roseville golf land where we all met had a Dance Dance Revolution USA mix.

67
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:16,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we wanted to start this show about, you know, the DDR and music game community because

68
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,487
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

69
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:37,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the first and the first day I was able to actually meet Jamie.

70
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,079
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, lots of good memories going way back.

71
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:57,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we've been, you know, and for many years, this show was really about music games and primarily Konami's Bamani, you know, Beatmania, the original music game, which was actually before DDR and their whole series and, you know, the fandom and tournaments.

72
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,385
[SPEAKER_06]: was a big, big part of what we used to talk about.

73
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:05,849
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, we broadcast live from a tournament at Pier 39 in San Francisco.

74
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:12,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a big deal for us, you know, in the early days of internet radio, because that would have been about like 2003 when we did that, if you think about it.

75
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:19,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It was kind of a big deal, a lot of fun, you know, and these DDR tournaments are really about community and getting to talk to people.

76
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,180
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what the show is all about.

77
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's why when I heard about this story this week,

78
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,164
[SPEAKER_06]: This resonated with me a little bit.

79
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:30,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's going on?

80
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:33,108
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still DDR, you know, DDR has been having a resurgence.

81
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:38,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I should probably say this is that I don't want to say we ever fell out of love of DDR.

82
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:48,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think because we saw a long period of time, you know, when we did the show, what DDR Max 2 was like the new mix, and then Extreme came out.

83
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:52,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we had a little bit of a period where like they were releasing home versions pretty regularly.

84
00:05:52,702 --> 00:06:02,390
[SPEAKER_06]: They started to really pick up the US presence on the home versions with, you know, the Xbox versions and, you know, the PlayStation, you know, Extreme and Extreme 2, you know, some of those things.

85
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:14,681
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had a lot to talk about, but then things started to dry out a little bit because it felt like Konami did not really have the faith or the risk to continue to produce

86
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:19,065
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR games and new music games for quite some time.

87
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:24,709
[SPEAKER_06]: They took a little bit of a break, and by them taking a break, it caused other music games to rise up.

88
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:31,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when Guitar Hero happened, and Rock Band, and the rise of all that stuff.

89
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:35,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, a lot of that then led to, now Konami's back in the business, right?

90
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:43,802
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks to, you know, Japanese arcades and these partnerships with places like Round One or even, you know, places like Dave & Buster's still getting machines.

91
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:47,644
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had, you know, calls on this show kind of talk about the status of all that.

92
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:49,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we still have DDR today.

93
00:06:49,906 --> 00:07:00,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really interesting, because we've been able to watch a whole new and, you know, not to be the old man on the chair, but kind of a little bit, we've been able to watch a whole new generation of folks

94
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:06,795
[SPEAKER_06]: come up that really love this series and really love these music games and have that fandom.

95
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:14,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Ironically, there are now podcasts about Bomani and music games at this point, which is funny.

96
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,801
[SPEAKER_06]: We stepped away from that and shifted our focus to video games because

97
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,702
[SPEAKER_06]: for a long period of time, there wasn't any Bomani news.

98
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:23,823
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have anything to talk about for quite some time.

99
00:07:23,823 --> 00:07:25,464
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very, very minimal.

100
00:07:25,464 --> 00:07:29,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And we kind of decided, you know what, we're more like video games first.

101
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are 40 years in the desert.

102
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:31,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

103
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:39,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's neat to see the resurgence, and it's neat to see all of this come back again.

104
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,251
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's not neat to see is Konami's playing their same old tricks.

105
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:45,682
[SPEAKER_06]: and Konami.

106
00:08:02,406 --> 00:08:08,594
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this big tournament called KAC, which is the Konami Arcade Championships.

107
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:14,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And DDR, of course, is one of the games that is going to be represented in these championships.

108
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a very prominent DDR player

109
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:21,969
[SPEAKER_06]: from North America, who goes by the name Chris4Life.

110
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:27,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've probably seen him, you know, in tournaments, you know, a couple years ago, and so forth.

111
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:30,895
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other, you know, great AAA players too, as well.

112
00:08:30,895 --> 00:08:31,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Please forgive me.

113
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:35,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't follow the series as much as I used to, so I don't know all of your names.

114
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:39,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know that there are a lot of people that are super, you know, into DDR, very good at it.

115
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:42,263
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, Chris4Life is known as really one of the best.

116
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:43,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very good.

117
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:44,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Wins championships, right?

118
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:53,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So he and some of his other, you know, AAA playing friends want to join the Konami Arcade Championships.

119
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:53,952
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the problem.

120
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:59,495
[SPEAKER_06]: They got essentially kicked out of registering for Konami Arcade Championships.

121
00:08:59,495 --> 00:08:59,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

122
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:05,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in order to qualify for the championships, you have to play certain qualifier songs.

123
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:11,364
[SPEAKER_06]: But to play those songs, your account has to have access to what's called PSELE.

124
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:16,187
[SPEAKER_06]: To have access to this, your account's residence has to be in Japan.

125
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:19,450
[SPEAKER_06]: And so your account's residence must match your real residence.

126
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:34,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can't have you know, and you can't do like several accounts and this type because I guess I think somebody else actually did this this other player Nate, Nat8 or something like that was disqualified for having one account in Japan and it didn't match the actual residence.

127
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:42,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And sure enough, Chris wrote on his Twitter account, I was disqualified from KAC as were my fellow American DDR players.

128
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:49,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Last week, each of us received emails from Konami asking us to explain our KAC entries because they were in jeopardy of being invalidated.

129
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:58,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I explained our situation to them and made it known that the rules for entry this year were set up in a way that made it impossible for any non-Japanese player to submit a valid entry.

130
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:04,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I've included the email transcripts below for full transparency.

131
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that next year Konami doesn't plan to give us the same runaround, but if they do, I sincerely hope they save us all the trouble and just say, KAC is Japan only from the beginning.

132
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:18,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's a very important thing to note.

133
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:24,666
[SPEAKER_06]: If the Konami Arcade Championships had just said up front, this is only open to residents of Japan, this wouldn't be a problem.

134
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,263
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not doing that.

135
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And from where I'm sitting, they're trying to give the perception that this is a global tournament.

136
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they've got these silly rules because, again,

137
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:41,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And this just goes back to what pissed me off about Konami years ago.

138
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:49,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami isn't willing to invest in the audience over here the way that they are the audience in Japan.

139
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:56,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And we live in this global economy now, especially with round one, importing these machines and having these deals.

140
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we not getting the same experience?

141
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:13,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are folks banned from these tournaments because of these workarounds that they have to work around because Konami just won't fucking set up the game like every other company sets up the game?

142
00:11:13,346 --> 00:11:18,728
[SPEAKER_06]: OrangeRide also points out they had a rule that you have to speak conversational Japanese.

143
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,409
[SPEAKER_06]: They eventually got rid of it, and then they did this.

144
00:11:22,631 --> 00:11:26,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if you want to limit it to Japan, just limit it to Japan.

145
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:37,258
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead, and I love that Chris did this, honestly, is that Chris pasted these emails and said, here you go, for full transparency, here is what happened.

146
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:40,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm not going to read the entire thing.

147
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:43,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically Konami sent a message to Chris that said,

148
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: We were informed from a post on social networking that you entered with more than one account.

149
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:54,207
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is true, your entry will be invalidated and you'll forfeit your right to participate in the finals.

150
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:55,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm summarizing a little bit.

151
00:11:55,568 --> 00:12:02,572
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to read all these again, you can check out Chris's Twitter account at chrs4lfe.

152
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:07,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, my policy, yes, it is still called Twitter and it will always be called Twitter.

153
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you are a sponsor on Sesame Street, your company is not a letter.

154
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:11,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

155
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:21,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so Chris writes this email back and basically explains what's going on, the same thing I just outlined a little bit ago.

156
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:29,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami writes back, and this is the part where my fucking head explodes, reading this.

157
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:32,435
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so tacky and terrible, this response.

158
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Chris, This is Konami Arcade Championship Operations Team from Konami Amusement.

159
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:40,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for your response.

160
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:49,761
[SPEAKER_06]: After further examination of your response, you have been decided to be disqualified in accordance with the entry requirements and you will not be allowed to participate in the final round.

161
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:51,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate your understanding.

162
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:55,966
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope you will continue to patronize Konami's amusement products in the future.

163
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:05,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it, that's just stupid.

164
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,135
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no understanding.

165
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:10,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, it's like, yeah, sucks to be you.

166
00:13:10,917 --> 00:13:16,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And, but you continue to purchase our products and player products.

167
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:20,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, is it who who's been winning these tournaments in KAC?

168
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:24,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm just wondering if it's like a thing where, oh, hey,

169
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:27,372
[SPEAKER_05]: The US is coming in stomping.

170
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:30,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're like, Oh, well, this is making us look bad.

171
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:37,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're gonna limit it to only Japan only but in a roundabout way that's stupid.

172
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:39,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is that what the landscape looks like?

173
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:40,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

174
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:42,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, otherwise, it's just dumb.

175
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, DarkSakura, you bring you say something interesting in chat.

176
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:46,902
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying it's a copy paste response.

177
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:48,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So I doubt it was a personal attack.

178
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:51,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily think it was a personal attack either.

179
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,705
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was some real shit customer service.

180
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,396
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how Japanese companies are.

181
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:00,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the end of the, please look forward to it.

182
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:04,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, please say, you know, our thing.

183
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:10,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's just gotten emails like that too, from other Japanese companies.

184
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:14,771
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I don't think it was intended to be.

185
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,509
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like tone deaf or something.

186
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:19,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that was its intention.

187
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:23,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just a translation and a copy paste.

188
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:31,725
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does, which is probably what any end of service email that goes out from most companies in Japan will end with.

189
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:34,107
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how it is.

190
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,468
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not anything.

191
00:14:35,468 --> 00:14:36,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel zero over that.

192
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:42,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But DJRamaS brings up a good follow-up to this saying, the email sounds like they didn't even read the initial response.

193
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:51,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And considering this guy is a world champion, it just shows this complete obliviousness to the whole situation.

194
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:57,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the thing that pisses me off about it, yeah, it might be like, you know, okay, this is what they do or whatever, but it just

195
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It just reeks of shit.

196
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

197
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,261
[SPEAKER_06]: It just, it brings me back.

198
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:04,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe this is why I was so enraged when I read this.

199
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:11,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It just brings me back to 20 years ago, where it just felt like consistently Konami in Japan does not give a shit about us.

200
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So why do we continue to support them?

201
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:17,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

202
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know sometimes.

203
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:38,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, especially when I thought Konami was on this path to like improving themselves, you know, through some of the announcements from the Silent Hill thing, and you know, the relative, well, the Castlevania collection has been in the old school, you know, arcade collection has been and so forth.

204
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:42,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

205
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize this.

206
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:53,184
[SPEAKER_06]: OrangeRite says the top ranking player in Korea, FeFemz, got a special invite to KAC and says he's not going.

207
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:56,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Good on that person for taking that stance there.

208
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how did he get in?

209
00:15:57,286 --> 00:15:59,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you had to have... I thought you had to live in Japan.

210
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:00,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

211
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:01,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

212
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:01,989
[SPEAKER_05]: See, exactly.

213
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why, like, I don't want to like... Is there a special invitation?

214
00:16:06,024 --> 00:16:07,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's what I'm saying.

215
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:18,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I feel like, I don't want to sound, like, entitled, but I'm just wondering if it's like some sort of, not, I don't think it's reverse racism or anything like that, but it's like, it's a silly rule, first off.

216
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:22,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, I'm not, here, I'm not gonna assume anything from Konami.

217
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami's just poorly run.

218
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:26,210
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just what it is.

219
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:34,092
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm just gonna assume that they put these rules in place and they didn't think about the consequences of it.

220
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:36,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

221
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:39,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

222
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,701
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in-group versus out-group.

223
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:44,082
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how the whole society is structured.

224
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:46,462
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your in-group versus your out-group.

225
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:55,665
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not part of the intended group, then you just sort of get kind of pushed away and forgotten about.

226
00:17:00,294 --> 00:17:05,077
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very different type of thing to, it's two different mindsets.

227
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:07,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are looking at this from a very Western mindset.

228
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:19,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say this just, it's not just that I'm playing devil's advocate, but I think that we're also looking through this through very Western cultural lenses.

229
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:28,971
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a lot more, we include, it's, it's, you know, everyone from, I mean, well, we say that we do that, but people are still very, you know,

230
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:38,425
[SPEAKER_01]: was sort of thinking of exclusionist over here, but but Japan is very homogenous as a country.

231
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:39,526
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always been that way.

232
00:17:40,653 --> 00:17:55,242
[SPEAKER_01]: and change over the... I watch a lot of actual non-Japanese ethnic people who were born and grew up in Japan who experience this on a daily basis because they don't appear to be Japanese.

233
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,463
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how the culture is.

234
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:00,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that it's right or wrong.

235
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:09,430
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just we're looking at these through, you know, American lenses and we need to have a broader view of it.

236
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:18,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Konami needs to have a broader view of it when they want the Western dollars and the business over here.

237
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:22,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's now what some of this has led to.

238
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:30,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to be very careful how I approach this because Chris is being very vulnerable in this post on Twitter, and I don't want to sensationalize it or anything like that.

239
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,623
[SPEAKER_06]: But obviously, you know, these sorts of things can one thing can lead to another.

240
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:42,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, Chris wrote this very long post that and starts off by saying this isn't about being disqualified from KAC.

241
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:44,208
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just the cherry on top.

242
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:51,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It's running much deeper than that and kind of basically goes on to talking about he's not in a great place mentally right now.

243
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:56,075
[SPEAKER_06]: That this is this is the everything that's happened really has taken a toll.

244
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:11,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I dedicated over half of my entire life to DDR, and I feel like such a fool admitting that, because it's become extraordinarily clear that Konami couldn't care less about us or anything we've done with the game by banning us from KAC.

245
00:19:12,305 --> 00:19:16,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I have 18,000 plays on DDR which means I've spent at least $18,000 supporting their game.

246
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:27,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I also didn't once think that the people around me that I love will eventually move on from these things, leaving me alone with nothing but the high scores I dedicated myself to achieving and a life I had no plans for.

247
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:30,619
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was it all even for?

248
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:34,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And sums up by saying, I realized I need to find myself again, even though I don't know how yet.

249
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:35,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice being Chris for life.

250
00:19:36,283 --> 00:19:37,704
[SPEAKER_06]: but it can't be everything anymore.

251
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:47,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to discover rediscover the meaning of being his real name, something someone whose life is defining qualities, experiences, and will still have meaning if when rhythm games aren't there anymore.

252
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:51,373
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the only way I'll ever be truly happy in the end.

253
00:19:51,373 --> 00:20:05,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, that's a heck of a wake up call in some ways to have and I feel for the guy and again, I'm wanting to really be careful here not to sensationalize this and just like said nothing but like, love and support Chris's way through this whole thing.

254
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:05,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And

255
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:21,047
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it does go to show how a passing interaction like that can really have this effect where now he's like, it's almost like that person that's been working for a company years and years and years and gets laid off.

256
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:23,467
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, well, where the hell's that loyalty?

257
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:27,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's like, surprise, companies don't have loyalty.

258
00:20:27,188 --> 00:20:30,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the realization a lot of people are having about Konami.

259
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:33,610
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just another fucking money sucking

260
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:41,036
[SPEAKER_06]: company that cares about fucking profits and just cares about the dollars and they don't fucking care about you.

261
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:43,919
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care about your Twitter posts promoting their game.

262
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care about this show.

263
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:48,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'm going to dial it back.

264
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:53,007
[SPEAKER_06]: When there was offices in the States, there was more of that sort of caring.

265
00:20:53,007 --> 00:20:56,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So Konami now doesn't care about this type of stuff.

266
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And Konami, like Konami doesn't care about you.

267
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.

268
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:07,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever you want to chalk that up to, or any of that stuff, that's what it is.

269
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,925
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Philof9 says, do any companies care?

270
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:11,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

271
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:19,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm starting to question because, you know, just last week we were talking about a company that laid off people and most of it happened to be their community management folks.

272
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:24,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Most gaming companies have community management teams.

273
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you who obviously does not have this.

274
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:34,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can also figure it out.

275
00:21:34,191 --> 00:21:40,575
[SPEAKER_06]: S2100mat points out, I don't know if they'll do it this year, but I know a lot of the top 100 players try to fly out for the KAC anyways.

276
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:43,377
[SPEAKER_06]: They run a community tournament outside of KAC at a local arcade.

277
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:44,738
[SPEAKER_06]: That tournament is awesome.

278
00:21:44,738 --> 00:21:45,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Really cool.

279
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:48,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, the Riola tournament, I hope they do it again.

280
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:55,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's I honestly, I'm I am right back on the fuck Konami train.

281
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I am right back on that train.

282
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:58,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's I'm, I'm reminded

283
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:13,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reminded, because I relate everything in my life to RuPaul's Drag Race, I'm reminded of this Untucked from All Stars 1 that is awfully legendary, that shows Mimi, I'm First, you know, having kind of a meltdown.

284
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:21,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a cutaway to Chad Michaels that goes, you know, just when I thought she turned over a new leaf, there she is, the same old Mimi.

285
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:39,976
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really what I'm thinking about this situation is that oh man I thought Konami was on this path to like fixing things and getting better and then oh the Silent Hill game comes out and it's it's Silent Hill Ascension's a fucking mess and then this happens and I'm like up there she is same old Konami.

286
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:55,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people that support DDR continuing in this day and are dropping dollars in the machines and that whole thing really have a lot of stuff to question this week.

287
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:11,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank Chris for being vulnerable in that post and saying the things that he had to say, because I think there's a lot of people, in some ways myself included, that need to evaluate some of the loyalty to that stuff.

288
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:17,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Step Maniacs is a really cool dance game.

289
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,248
[SPEAKER_01]: going to ballet.

290
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:56,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, uh, yeah, I'm sorry to start off the show with what is essentially a bit of a bummer.

291
00:23:56,057 --> 00:24:08,306
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just I was thrown back to I was having a headline like it's 2003 up in here on OLR 20 years ago, it just it just felt like that to me.

292
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:10,428
[SPEAKER_06]: There she is the same old Konami.

293
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:19,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and see if it's the same old games that we've been playing this week or maybe some new games.

294
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,421
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, we'll go to you first.

295
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:23,902
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

296
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:29,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I started Retro Knight, but I'm not going to say what it is because it's a classic game.

297
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:29,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

298
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,172
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave it there.

299
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:36,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I, of course, played some Dead by Daylight.

300
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:40,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a funny thing happen when I was just testing to see if my voice was well enough.

301
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:46,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I played four games with a newer friend I've made through the game.

302
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:49,487
[SPEAKER_01]: They were a Huntress in our match.

303
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:53,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played four games.

304
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer let me out all four games.

305
00:24:56,837 --> 00:24:58,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Three hatches and one door.

306
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:03,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only reason I got the door was because I was a stubborn Meg.

307
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:08,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the Huntress you got in back-to-back games?

308
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:09,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Aunt Honey?

309
00:25:09,764 --> 00:25:10,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

310
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:17,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I was lurking in the channel and I remember you and Fixie were freaking out because you had the same killer in back-to-back games that you really liked.

311
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:21,591
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a spirit that Fixie got in the game and then I joined in and we got the same spirit.

312
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:22,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.

313
00:25:22,512 --> 00:25:23,232
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I was lurking.

314
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just cool with us.

315
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:33,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a bunch of Dreamlight Valley today.

316
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:41,359
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been playing in my downtime while I haven't felt well is just a buttload of Dreamlight Valley and some Cult of the Lamb.

317
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:49,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.

318
00:25:49,753 --> 00:26:10,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll pick up and play like a couple of little, like, I played some SNES stuff and I'm actually trying to talk myself out of dropping $40 on a VST for Logic Pro that's basically the entire Super Famicom sound synthesizer.

319
00:26:10,161 --> 00:26:12,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

320
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:13,462
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking myself out of it.

321
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:14,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I got other things to do.

322
00:26:15,816 --> 00:26:17,056
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Loki, we'll go to you.

323
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:18,677
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

324
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:19,897
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was pretty good.

325
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:25,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Ultimate Chicken Horse, of course, with some of the people on Channel 64.

326
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:28,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of fun to check out that game.

327
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, Minecraft.

328
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing some of the stuff still on Ravesworks server.

329
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:39,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And today we did the dragon fight with wardens everywhere.

330
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:40,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was fun.

331
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:44,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be in a video episode or two from now.

332
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:48,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, pretty much it.

333
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thanks.

334
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, my gaming week.

335
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:54,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, lots of Diablo 4 still going on this season.

336
00:26:54,174 --> 00:26:56,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I hit level 69 today.

337
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

338
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and... Nice.

339
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

340
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:08,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but that also means that my, uh, character has out-leveled my Eternal and Season 1 characters as well, so that's fun.

341
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:12,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, also I learned the hard way, if you're recording things for YouTube,

342
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:39,574
[SPEAKER_06]: um shut off trade chat because i actually recorded a video for my channel so i've been like like half-assing youtube on my personal channel like i'll fully admit i've been capturing gameplay when i don't have like the spoons for extraversion to like be on camera and talk it through and so forth like i've just been recording some game like i had like a theater than video last week with all the final fantasy 16 stuff and i did a diablo 4 when i did the world tier 3 unlock and i record one today for the world tier 4 unlock

343
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:47,560
[SPEAKER_06]: but I haven't been able to post it yet because I have to go back and put in the YouTube blur because TradeChat decided to start piping up with just

344
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:55,900
[SPEAKER_06]: all the crap that I was like, man, what a hard lesson learned that I forgot to leave trade chat because usually it's quiet in there.

345
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But then people decide to start acting foolish in there and saying things that aren't appropriate to repeat.

346
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:10,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, but anyway, yeah, if you want to, my YouTube is actually Rob Roberts plays, because I think Rob Roberts like makes guns or something.

347
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't don't follow that channel.

348
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:13,250
[SPEAKER_06]: But Rob Roberts plays on YouTube.

349
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:17,033
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, admittedly, I'm not like super trying to grow my YouTube presence.

350
00:28:17,033 --> 00:28:17,493
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like,

351
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:25,022
[SPEAKER_06]: when I just feel like I have this 4K capture card and a nice computer and I feel like I'm not recording any like really pretty gameplay from it.

352
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just trying to do that a little more often.

353
00:28:26,723 --> 00:28:28,064
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all.

354
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:32,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I did some Diablo 4 over there.

355
00:28:32,288 --> 00:28:34,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And gosh, what else have I played this week?

356
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little bit of Dead by Daylight.

357
00:28:36,432 --> 00:28:37,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot, but just a little bit.

358
00:28:37,953 --> 00:28:40,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I also played a little bit of Warcraft Classic.

359
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:41,957
[SPEAKER_06]: just a little bit of that.

360
00:28:41,957 --> 00:28:43,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know what I played this week.

361
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:44,919
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fun.

362
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:47,601
[SPEAKER_06]: So N7 day was this week, right?

363
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:50,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you know, we got a trailer for a game.

364
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:51,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not even a trailer.

365
00:28:51,824 --> 00:28:54,206
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a whisper.

366
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:56,228
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a we got a trick.

367
00:28:56,228 --> 00:28:56,968
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't get a trailer.

368
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:05,775
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a trick because we got a whisper of what the next Mass Effect game might look like a game we're not going to be playing till 2026 at the earliest.

369
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:09,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, whatever they're continuing to tease that and this is like,

370
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:11,058
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks cool.

371
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:17,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess but I'm just I think about a game like Final Fantasy 13 or excuse me, Final Fantasy 15.

372
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:20,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost said 13 versus because that's what that game was.

373
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:23,343
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think about how the thing Yeah, I think about how we'll go.

374
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, if you've played and beat 15

375
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:32,728
[SPEAKER_06]: go back and watch a trailer for 13 Versus, and you'll be like, what the fuck is this game?

376
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:36,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the same characters, but this is not the same game.

377
00:29:36,671 --> 00:29:42,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I just have this bad feeling, you know, Mass Effect's probably gonna change a lot before it comes out.

378
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:43,635
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it's fine.

379
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:45,476
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why I'm just like, okay, I'll

380
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:52,861
[SPEAKER_06]: hype train will wait until they have a release date that's like within a year, then I'll start buying into the hype.

381
00:29:52,861 --> 00:30:00,605
[SPEAKER_06]: But my point is, because it was in seven day, one of my friends was like, we should play Mass Effect three.

382
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:01,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like,

383
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:05,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, are the multiplayer servers even still running for that game?

384
00:30:05,128 --> 00:30:06,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, they are.

385
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:07,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, we did.

386
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,051
[SPEAKER_06]: We know we know what?

387
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:09,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

388
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:11,893
[SPEAKER_06]: The servers for Mass Effect 3 PC are still up.

389
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I actually had to think I was like, where's my origin?

390
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:16,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I had to download.

391
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,618
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not even origin anymore, by the way.

392
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:19,959
[SPEAKER_06]: They closed that years ago.

393
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,901
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had to download like the EA thing, install that.

394
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:26,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, you can still play Mass Effect 3 on PC.

395
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:29,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of the randos are in gold and platinum.

396
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:54,969
[SPEAKER_06]: but we went into a bronze we cleared a bronze I was so happy I was like it y'all it took me a minute to remember how to fucking play Mass Effect but then I finally remembered okay with my Corian tech all I have to do freeze explode freeze explode freeze explode I finally was like okay I can get through a bronze that was fun because honestly I hadn't played Mass Effect 3 since I had the Krogan oh go ahead

397
00:30:57,113 --> 00:31:00,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I had that Krogan named Rex in effect after the band.

398
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:01,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:02,236
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's fun.

400
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was fun seeing all my old characters and stuff.

401
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:08,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looked the nice thing is because I hadn't played it on my newer computer.

402
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:11,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all know I got a new computer about a year and a half ago.

403
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was able to play it in like 2k.

404
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, dang, this looks nice.

405
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:17,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really fun.

406
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:17,564
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

407
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:20,587
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun to venture back and check out Mass Effect 3.

408
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,329
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my N7 day, was reliving the good old days.

409
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:25,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was so much I couldn't remember.

410
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what does this rating mean?

411
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do prestige characters?

412
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:29,595
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you get for prestige?

413
00:31:29,595 --> 00:31:31,778
[SPEAKER_06]: There was so much I couldn't remember.

414
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:33,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, it was good times.

415
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster in chat says, I miss Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but I remember enjoying it enough to unlock more characters.

416
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:46,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I oh my God, that's the reason why I bought Mass Effect 3 like four times.

417
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,612
[SPEAKER_06]: You all give me so much shit for buying Mass Effect 3 four times.

418
00:31:48,612 --> 00:31:53,316
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I did it was for multiplayer.

419
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:54,837
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

420
00:31:54,837 --> 00:31:56,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, with that, that's our gaming weeks.

421
00:31:56,739 --> 00:32:01,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get into some news and what is going on around the game industry this week.

422
00:32:01,343 --> 00:32:02,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will start with Loki.

423
00:32:04,244 --> 00:32:15,967
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so Nintendo has been trying to fight off rumors about their next console, which we know is coming, I mean, obviously.

424
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:23,769
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, you know, there's also litigation going on with other companies, you know, like Activision and Epic and all that stuff.

425
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:26,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of all of that.

426
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,671
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, stuff is kind of leaked out, per se, so.

427
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:49,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course, with that, a Japanese outlet, Mainichi, has reported that apparently Nintendo has showcased their devices to partners at public events and private meetings with different companies.

428
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:59,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also the FTC versus Microsoft court case that also leaked out information regarding that it's been shown to Activision.

429
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:04,005
[SPEAKER_05]: because obviously they were looking to purchase Activision.

430
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:09,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So that information came out from that with the court documents.

431
00:33:09,026 --> 00:33:10,027
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know it's coming.

432
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:14,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously it's probably next year at some point.

433
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:18,950
[SPEAKER_05]: We just, you know, it'll be like the Switch, you know, where they announce it like beginning of the year, it comes out in March.

434
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll just have to wait and see.

435
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:29,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would be silly to think Nintendo isn't working on something, just like Sony is absolutely working on PlayStation 6.

436
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:30,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is.

437
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:34,324
[SPEAKER_02]: They are working on everything.

438
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:39,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, especially with Mainichi, though, going to the source.

439
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:42,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that right?

440
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:43,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, for sure.

441
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:48,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also, you know, with the core documents and everything, it's, you know, pretty much in

442
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:50,329
[SPEAKER_05]: in the comments.

443
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:04,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I

444
00:34:21,084 --> 00:34:22,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the Game Awards.

445
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:23,265
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure not.

446
00:34:23,265 --> 00:34:24,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that thought out of your head.

447
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:26,527
[SPEAKER_06]: There will not be a new Switch at the Game Awards.

448
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:28,688
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason for Nintendo to do that.

449
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:33,011
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they will not do that because they want the eyes all on them.

450
00:34:33,011 --> 00:34:36,953
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will do their own unveiling of that somehow.

451
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:38,754
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not going to be on the Game Awards.

452
00:34:38,754 --> 00:34:41,616
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Awards is probably going to have other things that are significant.

453
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:43,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

454
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:46,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Something we'll get to later in the show that seems certain.

455
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:46,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

456
00:34:48,393 --> 00:34:56,502
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, something that is doing new hardware, and we know that this is a thing that is confirmed because there's a whole website about it.

457
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:57,944
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new Steam Deck.

458
00:34:57,944 --> 00:34:59,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, new-ish.

459
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like a hardware refresh.

460
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,709
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a visual refresh.

461
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:05,713
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Steam Deck OLED.

462
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:07,315
[SPEAKER_06]: The Steam Deck OLED.

463
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Nintendo.

464
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:09,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Jamie?

465
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:12,999
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pulling a Nintendo.

466
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:13,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

467
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Like how the Switch made an OLED.

468
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

469
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:16,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

470
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:19,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Steam is making an OLED version as well, for sure.

471
00:35:19,805 --> 00:35:25,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's coming out on November 16th and it will start for $549.

472
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:30,033
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to feature an OLED screen with a larger picture, better battery life, faster Wi-Fi.

473
00:35:30,033 --> 00:35:32,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, these are all the nice marketing words.

474
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:34,817
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am hearing the screen is very nice.

475
00:35:34,817 --> 00:35:36,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was one of the things that people

476
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:43,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like for the most part, people really did enjoy the original Steam Deck, but the screen was maybe one of those things people said could be improved.

477
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:44,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's it.

478
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:48,746
[SPEAKER_06]: By making an OLED screen, that is certainly doing it.

479
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:58,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will also make the battery life longer with this, and downloads are supposed to be faster, I think, through some of the Wi-Fi, because it's Wi-Fi 6E that is going to be in there.

480
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:00,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty cool.

481
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:03,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, a different fan and some different thermal stuff.

482
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:07,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna run a little bit lighter as well.

483
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:09,558
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it looks really cool.

484
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:23,346
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not an improvement on speed or that sort of hardware, so you can't really call this a full refresh or a Steam Deck 2, but this is definitely like the pinnacle of what the Steam Deck first generation is gonna be.

485
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:27,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to admit, I'm a little bit tempted, but I think I'm gonna

486
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:33,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna hold out and try to wait for them to eventually do a hardware refresh, which I'm sure will happen at some point.

487
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:42,545
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still get the LCD screen, 256 gigabyte Steam Deck if you want for $399.

488
00:36:42,545 --> 00:36:46,907
[SPEAKER_06]: The $549 is for a 512 gigabyte OLED.

489
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:59,072
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to spend premium dollars, you can get the $679 limited edition 1 terabyte OLED, which is it's pretty much the same thing, but with a 1 terabyte drive.

490
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:01,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get what do you get?

491
00:37:01,153 --> 00:37:03,394
[SPEAKER_06]: A limited edition carrying case.

492
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:03,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

493
00:37:04,614 --> 00:37:08,577
[SPEAKER_06]: an exclusive startup movie and virtual keyboard theme.

494
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:09,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

495
00:37:09,237 --> 00:37:17,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, but I guess that'll probably be alluring to some people, but the one terabyte in storage is certainly going to be very welcome as well on that.

496
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:19,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

497
00:37:19,484 --> 00:37:24,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's go ahead and move on to our next story, which a lot of people are talking about this week.

498
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:27,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right, Jimmy.

499
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:29,711
[SPEAKER_01]: And this comes directly from Nintendo.

500
00:37:29,711 --> 00:37:31,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually, uh, Nintendo of Japan.

501
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:41,770
[SPEAKER_01]: They are working on the development of a live-action Legend of Zelda film.

502
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:47,632
[SPEAKER_01]: The representative director and president, Shuntaro Furukawa,

503
00:37:50,193 --> 00:37:54,075
[SPEAKER_01]: on behalf of Nintendo has announced that it's developing the film.

504
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:56,956
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be produced by Miyamoto.

505
00:37:56,956 --> 00:38:04,220
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be produced by Avi Arad, who is the chairman of Arad Productions.

506
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Done a bunch of films.

507
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:08,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be directed by Wes Ball.

508
00:38:08,642 --> 00:38:14,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It is co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures, although more than 50% of it is financed by Nintendo.

509
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:19,210
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will be distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures.

510
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:28,522
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there's not really a whole lot about this, just that, um, it's going to happen.

511
00:38:29,488 --> 00:38:31,250
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got names on it.

512
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is behind the design.

513
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:36,214
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.

514
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:41,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's interesting because the first thing almost everybody wants to jump to is casting.

515
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:44,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And people are like, Oh, well, it's gonna be Tom Holland that plays Link.

516
00:38:44,901 --> 00:38:49,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And oh, I look forward to Chris-san, you know, joining as Link.

517
00:38:49,846 --> 00:38:52,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Timothee Chalamet or whatever as Link.

518
00:38:52,128 --> 00:38:55,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, the actors you are all naming are too old.

519
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,526
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is wild for me to say, but that is realistic.

520
00:39:00,526 --> 00:39:02,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The actors you all are naming are too old.

521
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:09,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be somebody you probably haven't heard of, or maybe has been in one or two things.

522
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:12,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have to be somebody who is

523
00:39:13,936 --> 00:39:22,959
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be, I would say, younger 20s, or the time they start filming.

524
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:30,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I would, if they've just made this announcement, they probably are just through mostly concepts and scripting.

525
00:39:31,261 --> 00:39:36,023
[SPEAKER_01]: or not even scripting, just, you know, screenplay touch up, I would imagine at this point.

526
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:41,045
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, there's nothing that any kind of speculation help with.

527
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

528
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:49,389
[SPEAKER_06]: The timing of this announcement is interesting because they did if I'm not mistaken, they did wait until like the day after the actor strike was resolved.

529
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:49,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

530
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:52,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, the actor strike did get resolved this week.

531
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Y'all hadn't heard.

532
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:54,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is exciting news.

533
00:39:55,992 --> 00:39:57,513
[SPEAKER_06]: as long as the actors got a fair deal.

534
00:39:57,513 --> 00:40:00,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, some are still taking issue with some of the AI provisions.

535
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:04,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some people in SAG-AFTRA that are not happy with AI provisions.

536
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:12,699
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, for the most part, they certainly got a better deal than they were being the last and final offer they got the first time.

537
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:13,900
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's good.

538
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is interesting.

539
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:23,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So you kind of wonder how much work has been happening behind the scenes while the strike was going on that now they're coming kind of coming out and announcing this now, which is interesting.

540
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:33,704
[SPEAKER_01]: This is live action, so I doubt you're gonna see the voice actors.

541
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:47,121
[SPEAKER_01]: come in any kind of on-screen role unless they are a complete and utter physical, identical, hit the age, blah, blah, blah, all of the visual stuff that they look for on a big production.

542
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:47,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

543
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:48,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree.

544
00:40:48,562 --> 00:40:53,726
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to see... A cameo is usually what you're going to get in this situation.

545
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:58,430
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to get a cameo maybe, but I wouldn't hold out for that.

546
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:05,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say if they do, I kind of feel like an unknown ultimately is going to be Link.

547
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:09,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the speculation about who's going to be cast, I'm sure there's already a million YouTubes trying to figure that out.

548
00:41:09,936 --> 00:41:15,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, it's meaningless because I really think a unknown is ultimately going to get the part.

549
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:17,381
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the reality.

550
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:28,227
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think if they put a well-known actor in the project, probably in the role of Ganon, because I feel like that's something they can

551
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:31,590
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerKlaw on chat says it'll be known actors.

552
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,390
[SPEAKER_06]: You sure of that?

553
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:49,882
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's pretty common that unknown actors get cast in some big projects or things that maybe you don't know them as well yet.

554
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:55,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Like somebody like Jennifer Lawrence, when she got The Hunger Games, wasn't super, super well known.

555
00:41:55,667 --> 00:42:00,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Or here's a better, Daniel Radcliffe, when he got cast as Harry Potter, right?

556
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:02,892
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like a nationwide search type of thing, right?

557
00:42:02,892 --> 00:42:04,153
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very famous now.

558
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:10,015
[SPEAKER_06]: But when he was cast as Harry Potter, which granted was an 11 year old kid at the time, he wasn't very well known.

559
00:42:10,015 --> 00:42:18,539
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, I do feel like, you know, it might be somebody from like a Netflix show or somebody that's done one or two little things.

560
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:26,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I don't think it's going to be anybody, you know, but they could throw somebody, you know, into one of the other roles like Ganon or, or something else.

561
00:42:26,882 --> 00:42:28,003
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be very, very interesting.

562
00:42:29,434 --> 00:42:30,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I like this.

563
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:35,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Questbuster in chat says, I'd like to see them pull a Tim Curry-like move with Ganon.

564
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe referring to the movie Legend and Darkness and all that.

565
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:43,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Make people do a double take and be like, OMG, they were Ganon?

566
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:45,068
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be pretty cool.

567
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:45,488
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway.

568
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:51,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to participate in too much speculation here because this is a long, long ways off.

569
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:55,414
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think most people are just excited that like, yeah, it's happening.

570
00:42:55,414 --> 00:43:03,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that it's live action, I think is a huge thing for some people, because I think many people were expecting, it'll probably be animated.

571
00:43:03,478 --> 00:43:09,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because, you know, it'll be it'll be easier for them to, you know, get the essence of it.

572
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:11,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be interesting.

573
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:12,923
[SPEAKER_05]: But they said it was gonna be live action.

574
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,263
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know.

575
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,191
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's great.

576
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:16,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you mean Ganon being animated?

577
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

578
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:20,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that people were assuming the movie would be animated.

579
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:23,596
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we have the confirmation that it's going to be live action.

580
00:43:23,596 --> 00:43:26,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's very exciting for some people.

581
00:43:26,118 --> 00:43:28,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, yeah, we'll see.

582
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,543
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see how it goes in our discord over at VOG Network dot com slash discord throughout the week.

583
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:37,285
[SPEAKER_06]: People were tongue in cheek making jokes about the Smash Brothers initiative.

584
00:43:37,285 --> 00:43:43,049
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, now that we have what Detective Pikachu, Mario Brothers, Sonic and all these other movies.

585
00:43:46,114 --> 00:43:50,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that won't be happening in a Legend of Zelda movie because my assumption is...

586
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:59,658
[SPEAKER_06]: The Zelda movie will have more of a serious tone than what we saw in the Mario movie or Detective Pikachu or any of those other movies.

587
00:43:59,658 --> 00:44:03,181
[SPEAKER_06]: My assumption is that the Zelda movie is going to have a more serious tone.

588
00:44:03,181 --> 00:44:05,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume so.

589
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,524
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be lucky if they sneak in the line.

590
00:44:07,524 --> 00:44:08,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, excuse me, princess.

591
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:11,407
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be damn lucky if that happens.

592
00:44:11,407 --> 00:44:13,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's about all you're going to get.

593
00:44:13,408 --> 00:44:14,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it does.

594
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:15,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it does, too.

595
00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:16,471
[SPEAKER_06]: He said the thing.

596
00:44:16,471 --> 00:44:17,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

597
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:18,652
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, there's no...

598
00:44:19,953 --> 00:44:22,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I, yeah, MikeDef says, please don't.

599
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:23,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're all jesting, but still.

600
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:29,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm just really here to say that's not going to happen in the Zelda movie.

601
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:32,841
[SPEAKER_06]: If anything like that were to ever happen, it's not going to.

602
00:44:32,841 --> 00:44:45,188
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it were to ever happen, it would happen in a more silly movie like the Sonic movie or the Mario movie or something that's or the upcoming Donkey Kong movie, I'm sure will happen eventually.

603
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:45,969
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not going to happen.

604
00:44:47,295 --> 00:44:48,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go on to our next story Loki

605
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:34,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so this is kind of, I mean it's not shocking because I think Xbox was the first to make this type of move but Sony is getting rid of Twitter integration as of tomorrow actually and you'll no longer be able to use the share button to actually share stuff to Twitter because you know a certain super smart genius CEO decided to really raise the cost of those APIs and so

606
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:39,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Since they can't do the API calls, the functionality is buh-bye.

607
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:47,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did love the comment, though, when they reached out to Elon Musk for a comment.

608
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:59,138
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, our X is aiming to become a major streaming platform, and this will be less convenient for console players now that both Xbox and PlayStation integration is gone.

609
00:45:59,138 --> 00:46:00,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I will look into this.

610
00:46:00,518 --> 00:46:01,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure you will, bud.

611
00:46:01,539 --> 00:46:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure you will.

612
00:46:02,964 --> 00:46:08,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least it wasn't an auto-reply with a poop emoji, because I thought that's what inquiries were supposed to be getting.

613
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,569
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, super mature.

614
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:14,891
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just short-sighted and stupid, just like he is.

615
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:15,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

616
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:16,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, what are you going to do?

617
00:46:16,712 --> 00:46:20,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike Deftonchat says, I'm amazed that Nintendo still has Twitter integration.

618
00:46:20,315 --> 00:46:23,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I am also amazed at that.

619
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:27,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it something that, like, it's a time thing or something like that?

620
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:29,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, do they have it for a certain amount of time?

621
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when it comes up, it has to be renewed or I don't know.

622
00:46:32,762 --> 00:46:38,125
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it's after a certain point they were going to charge for their API stuff.

623
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:42,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was... I don't know what the details were there, but...

624
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:50,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of just like cost per use that they were having.

625
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,164
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the number of calls that they make in a certain time frame would cost a certain thing.

626
00:46:55,164 --> 00:47:03,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they have it bucketed based off of like, oh, this company sends like 10,000, this one sends 100,000, you know, and stuff like that.

627
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they're just not using it that much.

628
00:47:05,691 --> 00:47:10,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think Nintendo is just slow to update stuff for their online service, and so they're probably just not

629
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:22,180
[SPEAKER_06]: MikeDeft also points out, but granted you could just make the clip on the consoles, send it to your phone and upload wherever.

630
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can also put it on a USB device.

631
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,491
[SPEAKER_06]: or get off Twitter.

632
00:47:35,491 --> 00:47:36,571
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your other option.

633
00:47:36,571 --> 00:47:37,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Get off Twitter.

634
00:47:37,872 --> 00:47:43,814
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's supposed to be a major streaming platform with everything and payments and stuff, right?

635
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:50,137
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll tell you what the major streaming platform is now is TikTok and Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.

636
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:55,319
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I would expect PlayStation opens up their sharing to next.

637
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:05,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be very surprised if at some point you are not able to share short clips to TikTok, Instagram, and or YouTube.

638
00:48:05,668 --> 00:48:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the place that these things will go.

639
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:19,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm actually kind of surprised, maybe it's because threads kind of reeks of something very rushed by the Instagram folks, but I'm very surprised something like threads

640
00:48:19,943 --> 00:48:20,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

641
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,151
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, I'm just hoping BlueSky figures that stuff out.

642
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:36,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to be over there more.

643
00:48:36,592 --> 00:48:43,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be a realist and somebody who loves, you know, BlueSky and the experience over there so far, don't hold your breath on that.

644
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to remember, BlueSky still doesn't have GIFs.

645
00:48:46,616 --> 00:48:48,837
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have direct messages.

646
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:53,419
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of features that didn't exist on Twitter at first, to be fair.

647
00:48:53,419 --> 00:48:56,180
[SPEAKER_06]: There were no GIFs integrated on Twitter at first, remember?

648
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,541
[SPEAKER_06]: This all took time to get.

649
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:02,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So eventually BlueSky will have some of that stuff.

650
00:49:02,003 --> 00:49:15,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that BlueSky was actually trying to go a little bit of a Mastodon kind of route where it was decentralized, except the key difference and why it's working in a way that Mastodon isn't, is that there is a designated central server.

651
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the app protocol is supposed to be for other things to kind of tie into Blue Sky.

652
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:24,698
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's why Blue Sky is succeeding, where Mastodon... Well, I shouldn't say Mastodon's failing.

653
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:25,439
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.

654
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:31,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Mastodon has its fans, but Mastodon isn't catching on in the same way for a lot of that.

655
00:49:31,445 --> 00:49:33,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a techie place right now.

656
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:35,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's all these other things, too.

657
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:38,713
[SPEAKER_06]: People talk about how certain people run their servers like they're an HOA.

658
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:46,034
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the other problem that Mastodon has right now is that it's too strict in some places and people are just like, no, I don't want that.

659
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:52,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas honestly, Blue Sky is like, dicks, tits, ass, it's everywhere.

660
00:49:52,535 --> 00:49:53,075
[SPEAKER_06]: You want it?

661
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:53,976
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.

662
00:49:53,976 --> 00:50:00,757
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's good integrated sensitivity settings.

663
00:50:00,757 --> 00:50:03,217
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to remember to fix those.

664
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:07,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the adult content filters are on by default.

665
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:23,225
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to see dicks, tits, ass, you name it, if you want to see FCF, and you can look it up to see what that means, you have to enable your adult settings in Blue Sky on the web in order to do that.

666
00:50:23,225 --> 00:50:32,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, my point is don't expect Twitter or excuse me, don't expect PlayStation integration on Blue Sky anytime soon if Blue Sky doesn't even have GIFs yet.

667
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It might get there eventually.

668
00:50:34,471 --> 00:50:37,132
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, if I'm PlayStation,

669
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:43,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm focused on TikTok, Instagram Stories, YouTube Shorts.

670
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:46,648
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the shares should be at.

671
00:50:46,648 --> 00:50:55,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, if you want, you can still do that same thing where you download the screenshot and share it the long way.

672
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,430
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do that on Blue Sky.

673
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done that with screenshots from No Man's Sky and stuff.

674
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:02,451
[SPEAKER_06]: No Man's Sky on Blue Sky.

675
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:04,412
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not confusing by any means.

676
00:51:04,412 --> 00:51:05,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

677
00:51:05,552 --> 00:51:05,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

678
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:07,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

679
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:18,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about some games that you definitely won't be sharing on Twitter because the future will be long gone by this point, and that is PlayStation Live service games that have been delayed.

680
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:24,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently half of the live service games have been delayed.

681
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:29,453
[SPEAKER_06]: The interesting thing about this story is that we don't know what they are, because these are things that haven't been announced yet.

682
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:42,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony President Hiroki Totoki told investors that six of the company's 12 upcoming live service games won't arrive until 2026 and after.

683
00:51:42,122 --> 00:51:46,766
[SPEAKER_06]: In a statement, we are reviewing the, excuse me, it's actually a transcription from the call,

684
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:49,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We are reviewing this.

685
00:51:49,587 --> 00:51:54,760
[SPEAKER_06]: We are trying as much as possible to ensure the games are enjoyed and liked by gamers for a long time.

686
00:51:56,135 --> 00:52:01,179
[SPEAKER_06]: of the 12 titles, six titles will be released by fiscal year 2025.

687
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:02,821
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our current plan.

688
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:06,444
[SPEAKER_06]: As for the remaining six titles, we're still working on that.

689
00:52:06,444 --> 00:52:17,292
[SPEAKER_06]: So SOTY going on to talk about that, you know, the big live service push, it doesn't change anything for the company, it gain quality is going to be the most important thing that it added added up.

690
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:19,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So but so far,

691
00:52:20,936 --> 00:52:25,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Horizon Forbidden West, Spider-Man 2, doing very well for Sony.

692
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:29,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Spider-Man 2 sold 5 million copies in its first week.

693
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Something to stack up there.

694
00:52:33,766 --> 00:52:58,711
[SPEAKER_06]: but we'll see we'll see what stuff is in store as far as their other live service games again these are things that are designed to keep the money rolling in regularly for better or for worse you know sometimes people are into it sometimes they're not so it really again the quality of the game is the big deal right and sometimes the not is the actual company that's doing the live service too yeah and that could be that too absolutely but like you know

695
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:00,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Battle Pass Cosmetics

696
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:24,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Necessitates it and has the quality that the fan base will support that stuff, then there you go.

697
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,541
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we've said this a lot.

698
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:29,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't shoehorn this shit into games that don't need it.

699
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:32,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what pisses people off about Diablo 4, honestly.

700
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:33,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do get it.

701
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:34,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I do get it.

702
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,866
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Diablo is not always a series that had this type of stuff.

703
00:53:39,577 --> 00:53:48,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, all right, moving on, DarkSakura with a very interesting, bleak, in some ways, look at the future of games.

704
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:51,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll talk about it.

705
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:59,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, when I saw this announcement, I was pissed because it was during the middle of, well, toward the end days of the SAG AfterStrike.

706
00:54:04,267 --> 00:54:21,206
[SPEAKER_01]: posted on social media that I refuse to name that they are pushing more AI development with M12 Ventures in-world AI.

707
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:22,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, let me rephrase myself.

708
00:54:22,747 --> 00:54:24,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft and M2 Ventures

709
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:40,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Portfolio company InWorld AI announced that they are developing generative AI tools for video games, a two-part toolkit that acts as a, quote, design co-pilot.

710
00:54:40,457 --> 00:54:46,540
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's supposed to let developers focus more on narrative, quest, game elements.

711
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

712
00:54:48,221 --> 00:54:49,501
[SPEAKER_01]: People pissed.

713
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:53,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, don't they even pay attention to the fucking news?

714
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:53,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they?

715
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:56,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this pissed off everybody.

716
00:54:56,405 --> 00:55:04,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Developers, voice actors, writers, influencers, of course.

717
00:55:04,514 --> 00:55:10,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in light of an industry that's had its layoffs in the thousands.

718
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:11,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hello?

719
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:16,060
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't empowerment.

720
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:25,685
[SPEAKER_01]: This is... Well, it's empowering them to turn a profit and pay fewer people is what it's empowering.

721
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:28,426
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely terrible.

722
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:41,553
[SPEAKER_01]: It's... I mean, and again, there may be a bit of jumping to conclusions on here because, of course, the first thing that you're gonna think of is how we've already seen AI be misused.

723
00:55:41,553 --> 00:55:42,013
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like...

724
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:54,484
[SPEAKER_01]: The big thing about this is that it's not going to be co-pilot, it's going to be a replacement.

725
00:55:54,484 --> 00:56:02,152
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already started using some of these tools to cut the workforce in part.

726
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:05,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand, to a degree, having an AI assist

727
00:56:07,128 --> 00:56:14,372
[SPEAKER_01]: would be helpful, I think, used in tandem with actually paying people to fucking be creative.

728
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:15,133
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?

729
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:15,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

730
00:56:15,613 --> 00:56:25,279
[SPEAKER_01]: A computer isn't going to have the level of creativity that a writer is going to have or an artist or a designer.

731
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:34,384
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to have the kind of emotiveness that a voice actor or a motion capture actor is going to have.

732
00:56:34,384 --> 00:56:35,524
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to do it.

733
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:40,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not near that level yet.

734
00:56:40,428 --> 00:56:56,983
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was something like, hey, I just designed all of these assets and I would like to get an idea of, you know, verify the database and let me know if these assets are going to be compatible with each other, you know, or, you know,

735
00:56:58,144 --> 00:57:02,468
[SPEAKER_01]: What assets do we have in the database that are going to apply to this?

736
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:06,993
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let an artist go to work and make the best use of it.

737
00:57:06,993 --> 00:57:08,654
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something like an assistive tool.

738
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:09,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.

739
00:57:09,255 --> 00:57:14,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are phrasing it as an assistive tool, but I'm pretty sure that that's not what it's actually going to be.

740
00:57:16,782 --> 00:57:20,985
[SPEAKER_01]: There's way too much focus on it.

741
00:57:20,985 --> 00:57:24,387
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry has just dumped so much money into it.

742
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:27,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a fan of machine learning.

743
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:37,077
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's kind of interesting to see in general, you know, like how it works, you know, the theory behind it.

744
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:42,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my mind, machine learning to me is advanced database access, right?

745
00:57:46,368 --> 00:57:54,899
[SPEAKER_01]: an entity that uses that database to do the job of a human, that's when you're getting into the dangerous territory.

746
00:57:54,899 --> 00:57:56,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no problem with machine learning.

747
00:57:56,841 --> 00:58:00,686
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a problem with how it's being implemented.

748
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:01,367
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that made sense.

749
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,300
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

750
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:32,437
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

751
00:58:55,717 --> 00:59:00,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a lot of the ways that we're talking about AI is machine learning.

752
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:10,324
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was quick to say earlier, I differentiated between machine learning and AI because AI is how it accesses the database that's learned.

753
00:59:10,324 --> 00:59:13,646
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the difference between reading your book and being the brain.

754
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:40,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but when it comes to machine learning and, you know, um, the, a system type of thing, um, I do think it's going to happen in video games because I think as we see textures get more and more, you know, that's, that's what takes video games so long to develop in part right now is trying to create these 4k art assets and trying to animate things, you know, and so forth.

755
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:54,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as we start getting into 8K televisions and even more frames a second and so forth, I think to bridge that gap in how long these art assets take to create, it's going to take some of that machine learning to make that happen.

756
00:59:54,820 --> 01:00:03,567
[SPEAKER_06]: But in that copilot sense, you know, still with the creative mind ultimately being in control, but using machine learning to, you know,

757
01:00:04,588 --> 01:00:06,390
[SPEAKER_06]: assist with those sorts of things.

758
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I sort of see this kind of coming in too, especially because too, that way with something like that, you're also able to feed it off your own company's information and you're not like feeding off of everything out there and stealing from all this stuff and that whole thing.

759
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:25,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's all.

760
01:00:25,026 --> 01:00:25,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, yeah.

761
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:40,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think it's going to happen in that end of things, and I don't think there's any getting around it, and I think, ethically, it's probably okay, because I sort of look at it as, like, it's just a really souped up, like, Photoshop filter.

762
01:00:40,045 --> 01:00:41,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really, really souped up.

763
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:43,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, that's what it is.

764
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:48,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an automated process applying to your thing to get it to do what you need it to do.

765
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:52,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm, you know, I'm extremely simplifying it, but that's like what I kind of look at it as.

766
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:59,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it comes to the creative parts with like text and voice, oh god, especially like voice acting and that sort of thing and all that stuff.

767
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:01,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no, just don't.

768
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:08,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're gonna get what you pay for and the fans are going to see through it.

769
01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:10,756
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a glorified macro.

770
01:01:17,057 --> 01:01:20,019
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what you have people for.

771
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:24,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.

772
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:28,724
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's move on to another pretty sad story.

773
01:01:28,724 --> 01:01:32,046
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, I think we kind of saw this one coming.

774
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:34,087
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, just another bummer in 2023 gaming news.

775
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:41,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so finally Activision Blizzard has confirmed the end of the Overwatch League.

776
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:49,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Now before we were kind of just, we saw the writing on the wall with that, but now they've officially ended.

777
01:01:49,228 --> 01:01:54,174
[SPEAKER_05]: They said we are transitioning from the Overwatch League and evolving competitive

778
01:01:54,654 --> 01:01:57,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Overwatch in a new direction.

779
01:01:57,577 --> 01:02:06,885
[SPEAKER_05]: We are grateful to everyone who made Overwatch League possible and remain focused on building our vision of a revitalized esports program.

780
01:02:06,885 --> 01:02:09,548
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, they're going to have details in the future.

781
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, they've paid out the 120, or the 20 teams involved, a total of $120 million.

782
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:21,016
[SPEAKER_05]: But then now that is, it is done.

783
01:02:21,016 --> 01:02:29,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we will see what new league or new way they do eSports is gonna be.

784
01:02:29,981 --> 01:02:37,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, they didn't really detail that yet, but... Yeah, interesting.

785
01:02:39,707 --> 01:02:45,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, and I can't help but think of like the Heroes of the Storm professional stuff and how that just kind of disappeared.

786
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that didn't that didn't bode well for the future of that game.

787
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:50,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's still up, but it's in a very autopilot mode.

788
01:02:50,572 --> 01:02:53,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see that happening with Overwatch, especially coming off of Blizzcon.

789
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:59,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But it does feel like losing that is but I just I feel like Overwatch League

790
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:08,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I think from the very beginning, well, the pandemic, you know, and all that, the COVID showing up and canceling live events for so long really didn't help.

791
01:03:08,274 --> 01:03:17,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you want to point at anything and go, that really kind of, like, stunted any growth that thing potentially had, I would say, you know what, it is COVID-19's fault.

792
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:28,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think they made some missteps in like how they pivoted from Twitch to YouTube and then pivoted like they kind of kept moving it around.

793
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:38,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really think they probably should have invested in a central place to do this because it's not like switching from Twitch to YouTube is not as simple as switching from ABC to CBS.

794
01:03:39,586 --> 01:04:06,263
[SPEAKER_06]: and I feel like executives don't understand what a shock they don't understand that that the way the viewer habits are they don't it's switching from twitch to youtube is not the same as switching from abc to fox or whatever and i i think that was a bad decision in the beginning as well um yeah phil and i in a chat says not to discredit all the hard work involved but i always feel like blizz esports are just for show stop trying to make them happen blizz

795
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:15,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I, in some ways it did really feel like they were really put, cause they wanted overwatch to be, you know, e-sports has kind of been bubbling.

796
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:17,473
[SPEAKER_06]: They all want it to be the next pro football, right?

797
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:19,635
[SPEAKER_06]: They want it to be something televised.

798
01:04:19,635 --> 01:04:24,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, so overwatch was really just trying to position itself as like, okay, if any game goes big, it's going to be this.

799
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:35,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And it did get like ABC coverage, you know, in the middle of the day on a Sunday, but it's still, it's still, you know, was there and was starting to, you know, kind of go through a little bit, but I just, I don't know.

800
01:04:37,253 --> 01:04:52,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like if your goal is to be accepted by the traditional broadcast methods, then you're not really looking at the new, modern, traditional forms of broadcast and how to get successful there.

801
01:04:54,335 --> 01:04:58,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's complicated, but I just think all the moving around was not good.

802
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, it was not helping.

803
01:05:00,178 --> 01:05:01,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

804
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:09,163
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but it's unfortunate because again, there's a lot of people involved in Overwatch League, a lot of people that work in that, a lot of hosts, a lot of players.

805
01:05:09,163 --> 01:05:11,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just it's it's a bummer all around.

806
01:05:11,664 --> 01:05:15,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe something more homegrown can grow from it.

807
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:21,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, it's probably going to be a lot harder to get more mainstream coverage with that.

808
01:05:21,889 --> 01:05:23,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

809
01:05:23,618 --> 01:05:24,518
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

810
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:29,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, moving on, let's talk a little bit about Netflix's foray into more mobile games.

811
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,781
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've been talking about this for a little while, that Netflix has been wanting to expand into doing more mobile games.

812
01:05:33,781 --> 01:05:36,122
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem like they're doing anything with it.

813
01:05:36,122 --> 01:05:38,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's just like, ooh, they've got mobile games.

814
01:05:38,983 --> 01:05:44,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, and they're usually things that aren't, you know, it's like, whatever, they're not interesting.

815
01:05:44,405 --> 01:05:48,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that Stranger Things original game was really not good, you know, and so forth.

816
01:05:48,266 --> 01:05:52,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing is that Netflix is doing some interesting positioning

817
01:05:52,407 --> 01:06:00,175
[SPEAKER_06]: to try to make their libraries stronger because they just announced Hades will soon be available to Netflix subscribers on iOS.

818
01:06:00,175 --> 01:06:04,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Android right now, but it will be on iOS.

819
01:06:04,078 --> 01:06:07,642
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing about that is there isn't Hades on iOS yet.

820
01:06:07,642 --> 01:06:13,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is new and kind of exclusive to Netflix and Hades was a pretty solid game.

821
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's going to be very interesting.

822
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:20,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Braid, The Anniversary Edition, Upgraded Audio, Hand Repainted Visuals, New Animation, and apparently New World of Puzzles to Solve

823
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:39,934
[SPEAKER_06]: also Commentary, which is kind of interesting.

824
01:06:39,934 --> 01:06:42,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is coming to Netflix as well.

825
01:06:42,216 --> 01:06:47,800
[SPEAKER_06]: That also will be coming to Windows and PlayStation and Xbox though, but you know, for mobiles, that's still pretty cool.

826
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Death's Door as well going to be coming as well.

827
01:06:50,662 --> 01:06:51,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Katana Zero.

828
01:06:51,682 --> 01:07:00,709
[SPEAKER_06]: So you see the Netflix is trying to amp it up a little bit in that department so that what Loki just said is not what people continue to say about Netflix.

829
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the whole, you know, trying to get some exclusives in that department is a pretty big deal.

830
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:11,747
[SPEAKER_06]: SGO100 Matt says the mobile games are just getting their foot in the door.

831
01:07:11,747 --> 01:07:17,992
[SPEAKER_06]: They're establishing itself as a platform before they start coming out with bigger titles.

832
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:18,993
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

833
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:25,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's travel back to a simpler time in this next segment than before we had games on our mobile devices.

834
01:07:25,738 --> 01:07:28,901
[SPEAKER_06]: You played your game on your CRT TV and you liked it.

835
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:47,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

836
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:50,986
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

837
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:54,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and DarkSakura, what did you pick as the classic game this week?

838
01:07:56,849 --> 01:08:03,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked Treasure of the Rudras, which is also known as Rudra no Hiho.

839
01:08:03,438 --> 01:08:11,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the game that I have started playing for Retro Night on Saturday and it's been on my list for a while and I decided just to

840
01:08:12,449 --> 01:08:15,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on in, you know.

841
01:08:15,171 --> 01:08:26,740
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a JRPG that was released by Square in 1996, and it is the last RPG that they developed for the Super Famicom.

842
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a big one.

843
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:33,565
[SPEAKER_01]: And it it brings in some elements from

844
01:08:36,272 --> 01:08:42,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably say some different Indian faiths.

845
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:51,909
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk of Rudra, which is a name taken from an aspect of Shiva.

846
01:08:51,909 --> 01:08:55,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And it talks about the wheel of creation and the wheel of time.

847
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:11,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say right now, it's like with any Japanese RPG, there are so many elements taken from so many different cultures that I'm not going to go further and address that.

848
01:09:11,464 --> 01:09:14,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, in the cycle of this game,

849
01:09:16,086 --> 01:09:20,648
[SPEAKER_01]: You show up when it's the age of humans.

850
01:09:20,648 --> 01:09:31,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So every 4,000 years, different races of beings, different species are wiped out.

851
01:09:31,795 --> 01:09:35,718
[SPEAKER_01]: You start off with like a

852
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:44,531
[SPEAKER_01]: The previous ones, there had been the Danons, there had been the Merfolk, the Reptiles, the Giants, finally you're on the Humans.

853
01:09:44,531 --> 01:09:49,775
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start 15 days before the new cycle is about to begin.

854
01:09:49,775 --> 01:09:53,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have three different scenarios.

855
01:09:53,098 --> 01:10:00,244
[SPEAKER_01]: One where you're playing Xion, the soldier, Risa, the princess, or an archaeologist named Serlam.

856
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:14,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And each of them in their 15 days have this, it's called a jade, that gets like embedded in them.

857
01:10:14,012 --> 01:10:20,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are going across different tasks that they have to accomplish in those last 15 days.

858
01:10:23,077 --> 01:10:30,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can actually switch out between the different storylines while you're doing it.

859
01:10:30,587 --> 01:10:35,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of going through one versus the other, you know?

860
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:49,823
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, sometimes they meet each other, they have an effect on each other, and then it can affect the story and over.

861
01:10:49,823 --> 01:10:56,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if one character leaves a relic somewhere, another character can pick it up on their part of the journey.

862
01:10:58,908 --> 01:11:00,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, different things like that.

863
01:11:00,629 --> 01:11:13,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you've done the three scenarios, you take on a fourth scenario involving, named the thief, Dune, who you run into in the rest of the, you know, earlier on in the story.

864
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:17,179
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very pretty.

865
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:21,041
[SPEAKER_01]: The music is great.

866
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:23,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the characters.

867
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:27,465
[SPEAKER_01]: The character designer was done by Amemiya Keita.

868
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:34,650
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm trying to think what else.

869
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:39,873
[SPEAKER_01]: He did some work for some of the Kamen Rider series.

870
01:11:39,873 --> 01:11:46,397
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked on Zerom, Mirai Ninja, Hakaider.

871
01:11:46,397 --> 01:11:49,359
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked on a lot of different stuff for TV.

872
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:49,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Garou,

873
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:58,205
[SPEAKER_01]: He also worked on Zyuranger, a couple episodes there.

874
01:11:58,205 --> 01:12:08,492
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a pretty big title, being one of the last ones that went on there.

875
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:14,256
[SPEAKER_01]: No spoilers, please.

876
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:22,181
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also the last game directed by Ide Kozy, who went on to retire after directing three titles.

877
01:12:23,842 --> 01:12:37,654
[SPEAKER_01]: This game still uses pixel art, even though 3D had already started being incorporated into some of Square's other games, like for example Chrono Trigger.

878
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:45,060
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the more unique things about this is that it has a word-based magic system.

879
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:53,398
[SPEAKER_01]: In the fan translation that I'm playing through, they're referred to as mantras.

880
01:12:53,398 --> 01:12:57,621
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just called magic words in the Japanese version.

881
01:13:01,768 --> 01:13:12,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you learn basic ones, but you can mix and match parts of those mantras to create a different spell.

882
01:13:12,232 --> 01:13:20,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, you could change, like, say the first part of it makes it a fire spell, but it's only a single target.

883
01:13:20,754 --> 01:13:22,155
[SPEAKER_01]: You can rename

884
01:13:23,055 --> 01:13:27,979
[SPEAKER_01]: the second part of it to make it one that attacks everybody.

885
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:38,387
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can make take something from being as destructive to a healing one that, you know, it's very, very in depth and kind of difficult to master.

886
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:43,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just gonna say right there.

887
01:13:43,271 --> 01:13:43,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.

888
01:13:47,019 --> 01:13:55,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So, at any rate, the music in this game, the soundtrack was scored by SocietyUG.

889
01:13:55,542 --> 01:13:57,563
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really, really pretty soundtrack.

890
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:00,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really like it.

891
01:14:00,204 --> 01:14:10,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the actual CD that came out had a track of the game's music called The Spirit Chaser by a group called The Stealth Boys.

892
01:14:10,127 --> 01:14:11,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's music in my sheet music.

893
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:22,813
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, this game was mostly positively received.

894
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:27,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40, for example.

895
01:14:27,675 --> 01:14:32,197
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some people who loved the actual notability.

896
01:14:33,764 --> 01:14:49,129
[SPEAKER_01]: the uniqueness of the magic system but also considered it to be a little bit too difficult for some people that the going in and out of the different storylines is a very novel approach to it that you can just switch around

897
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:58,202
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some that have even said it's one of the best games ever to come out on Super Famicom.

898
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,988
[SPEAKER_01]: The graphics in this are really, really good.

899
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:04,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story is very...

900
01:15:07,133 --> 01:15:09,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Very ambitious is a good word for it.

901
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:12,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to take a word someone else had used, but it was considered very ambitious.

902
01:15:12,974 --> 01:15:15,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it is.

903
01:15:15,415 --> 01:15:24,117
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a comment from Destructoid where they compared the plot and the perspectives to kind of like Game of Thrones.

904
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:31,479
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, you know, the big complaint being the difficulty of the linguistic magic system.

905
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:35,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, I'm thoroughly enjoying this game.

906
01:15:37,635 --> 01:15:48,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just gotten... I'm probably two hours, of course, two, three hours into the game right now, but I'm really enjoying it so far.

907
01:15:48,645 --> 01:15:52,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm invested in the characters, and I'm really having a good time.

908
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:55,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's the game.

909
01:15:55,592 --> 01:15:58,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Rudra no Hiho, Treasure of the Rudra.

910
01:16:00,336 --> 01:16:23,588
[SPEAKER_06]: all right and you know i've never i've never really knew anything about this game so this is definitely like a hidden gem of sorts so i mean obviously if it didn't come out here uh i probably you know would be less familiar with it but um yeah i think it's that's pretty cool one of those views i didn't play before so for me it's all completely new i'm really real rob i think you should play through it i think you know i mean so far

911
01:16:23,908 --> 01:16:25,890
[SPEAKER_06]: The backlog of games I have is unreal right now.

912
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:28,411
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, no, I yeah, I'd love to.

913
01:16:28,411 --> 01:16:31,093
[SPEAKER_06]: God, I need to quit my job and play games all day.

914
01:16:31,093 --> 01:16:32,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to become a streamer for a living.

915
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,876
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that sound?

916
01:16:34,876 --> 01:16:35,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be broke too.

917
01:16:35,837 --> 01:16:36,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

918
01:16:36,878 --> 01:16:38,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Default on my mortgage.

919
01:16:38,379 --> 01:16:41,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Quest Buster in chat says doubling down with what DarkSakura is saying.

920
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:45,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Typing in your own spells was a really exciting mechanic in this game for me.

921
01:16:45,304 --> 01:16:48,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Just really felt like a very creative thing to play with.

922
01:16:48,487 --> 01:16:51,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

923
01:16:51,009 --> 01:16:52,290
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

924
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:52,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Love that.

925
01:16:54,055 --> 01:16:54,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, okay.

926
01:16:54,855 --> 01:16:58,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, with that, we have some more stories coming at you.

927
01:16:58,276 --> 01:17:03,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, we're going to do some really quick in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

928
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:05,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's go to Loki.

929
01:17:05,578 --> 01:17:06,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes.

930
01:17:06,258 --> 01:17:12,259
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have news, of course, that Super Mario Wonder sold well because it's a Mario game and it's on the Switch.

931
01:17:12,259 --> 01:17:18,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And so of course it did really well, uh, 4.3 million units globally in the first two weeks.

932
01:17:19,249 --> 01:17:21,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty awesome.

933
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:25,756
[SPEAKER_05]: It has become the biggest release for a Super Mario title so far.

934
01:17:25,756 --> 01:17:28,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I say so far because you know the next one will be bigger.

935
01:17:28,499 --> 01:17:29,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario RPG.

936
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

937
01:17:30,281 --> 01:17:31,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

938
01:17:31,402 --> 01:17:31,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe.

939
01:17:31,983 --> 01:17:32,423
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

940
01:17:32,423 --> 01:17:33,865
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the big release coming out.

941
01:17:33,865 --> 01:17:37,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to spoil release dates, but I think most people are already tracking that.

942
01:17:38,393 --> 01:17:49,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and then we got news also, surprisingly, that Homelander, who is going to be in Mortal Kombat 1, is not going to be voiced by Anthony Starr.

943
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if that has something to do with the whole actor strike thing that was going on.

944
01:17:55,245 --> 01:18:04,951
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently, they asked if Homelander was going to be voiced by Anthony Starr on, I believe, Twitter and, oh no, I'm sorry, Reddit.

945
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:06,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, nope, he is not.

946
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:09,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's strange.

947
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:15,251
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already ripped the character out of Mortal Kombat 1.

948
01:18:15,251 --> 01:18:19,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you mean like the assets or whatever?

949
01:18:19,291 --> 01:18:21,612
[SPEAKER_01]: The assets have already been pulled from it.

950
01:18:21,612 --> 01:18:23,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

951
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:23,793
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

952
01:18:23,793 --> 01:18:27,773
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so that's unfortunate.

953
01:18:27,773 --> 01:18:31,654
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been really cool, but it's still cool, though, that he's in the game.

954
01:18:31,654 --> 01:18:33,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

955
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:34,155
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, DarkSakura.

956
01:18:38,309 --> 01:18:45,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of folks are excited and a lot of people are crying as well for other reasons about it.

957
01:18:45,275 --> 01:18:49,698
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, the Stranger Things chapter is back in Dead by Daylight.

958
01:18:51,032 --> 01:19:02,799
[SPEAKER_01]: We had gone over, you know, back when it was removed that it had to do, the theory was a lot with Netflix going into gaming and having their own Stranger Things game.

959
01:19:02,799 --> 01:19:04,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we know what happened with that.

960
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:08,642
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to say we told you so, but we're absolutely going to say we told you so.

961
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:15,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So Steve and Nancy are back and so is the Demodoggo, I'm sorry, the Demogorgon.

962
01:19:15,866 --> 01:19:17,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the Hawkins map.

963
01:19:18,827 --> 01:19:23,311
[SPEAKER_01]: And funny enough, I had never played Hawkins as a survivor.

964
01:19:23,311 --> 01:19:24,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I had only played as a killer.

965
01:19:24,772 --> 01:19:26,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you were a killer only then.

966
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:30,396
[SPEAKER_06]: You hadn't discovered your love of survivor yet.

967
01:19:30,396 --> 01:19:31,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

968
01:19:31,257 --> 01:19:33,979
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny thing, though, is that.

969
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:36,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Me having played as killer.

970
01:19:36,882 --> 01:19:45,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Made me super prepared for survivor on that match on that area, because I used to remember the places that I would forget to look at.

971
01:19:47,099 --> 01:19:51,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember them playing Survivor and, you know, some of the different turnarounds.

972
01:19:51,642 --> 01:19:55,425
[SPEAKER_01]: And the polyester room is still there.

973
01:19:55,425 --> 01:19:56,546
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm talking about?

974
01:19:56,546 --> 01:20:01,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the shot, because there's a clip of the streamer that was looking for their room.

975
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

976
01:20:03,823 --> 01:20:08,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's only certain situations a nurse can go in.

977
01:20:08,145 --> 01:20:11,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's only a nurse that can teleport into that wall.

978
01:20:11,027 --> 01:20:12,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can clip through it.

979
01:20:12,447 --> 01:20:18,691
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, now there are some things going on with this that kind of have me upset.

980
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:23,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just because the achievements are not going to be enabled.

981
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:27,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam and Dean will never be in a Dead by Daylight game.

982
01:20:27,378 --> 01:20:30,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not want them in a Dead by Daylight game.

983
01:20:30,501 --> 01:20:33,344
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have to be survivors and that's not going to happen.

984
01:20:51,219 --> 01:20:52,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not traumatize me that way.

985
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

986
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:57,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Supernatural.

987
01:20:57,262 --> 01:20:58,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I wouldn't know that.

988
01:20:58,763 --> 01:20:59,923
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen the show.

989
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:01,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, got it.

990
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:01,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

991
01:21:06,756 --> 01:21:13,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, you're not necessarily playing as the doll.

992
01:21:13,942 --> 01:21:17,865
[SPEAKER_01]: You are playing as Charles Lee Ray, possessing the doll.

993
01:21:17,865 --> 01:21:21,989
[SPEAKER_01]: So your first person perspective is as the ghost.

994
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:26,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are watching the back of Chucky running around doing stuff.

995
01:21:26,567 --> 01:21:28,568
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how they solved this.

996
01:21:28,568 --> 01:21:30,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everyone was like, oh, he's too small.

997
01:21:30,548 --> 01:21:31,448
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to work.

998
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:34,109
[SPEAKER_01]: The perspective is going to be wrong.

999
01:21:34,109 --> 01:21:34,929
[SPEAKER_01]: They made it work.

1000
01:21:34,929 --> 01:21:36,330
[SPEAKER_01]: You play the ghost.

1001
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Their render of him looked like a picture of my dad.

1002
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:39,010
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1003
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like a picture of my dad in the 70s.

1004
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:56,598
[SPEAKER_01]: What's cool is that when you are picking up a survivor, hook them, the ghost manifests and carries them, Chucky in one arm and the survivor in the other.

1005
01:21:56,598 --> 01:22:06,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the full one comes out, one of the premium skins is going to be Tiffany, voiced by Miss Tilly herself.

1006
01:22:08,729 --> 01:22:12,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am so excited about this.

1007
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:17,192
[SPEAKER_06]: This you have you all have to understand Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany is gay rights.

1008
01:22:17,192 --> 01:22:20,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize not everybody in chat or on the podcast is going to understand this.

1009
01:22:20,493 --> 01:22:26,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize you have to understand Tiffany, Jennifer Tilly, gay rights.

1010
01:22:26,555 --> 01:22:28,936
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1011
01:22:28,936 --> 01:22:29,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

1012
01:22:29,556 --> 01:22:33,538
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, for anyone who is watching live, you can see.

1013
01:22:33,538 --> 01:22:34,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, found some random people.

1014
01:22:34,478 --> 01:22:35,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's like, oh, it's third person.

1015
01:22:35,778 --> 01:22:37,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not third person.

1016
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first person as the ghost.

1017
01:22:41,443 --> 01:22:43,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that's really cool.

1018
01:22:43,245 --> 01:22:51,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one of my favorite YouTube personalities, MintSkull, went through and did all of the Easter eggs.

1019
01:22:51,112 --> 01:22:56,777
[SPEAKER_01]: His Mori is a combination of like six to seven different Easter eggs from the movies.

1020
01:22:56,777 --> 01:22:57,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1021
01:22:57,838 --> 01:22:58,338
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.

1022
01:22:59,298 --> 01:23:00,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's neat.

1023
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:03,540
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people were wondering like how they were going to make this happen.

1024
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a lot of people were saying, well, you can't get Chucky in Dead by Daylight.

1025
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:06,581
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't work.

1026
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:08,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And they they found a way to make it work.

1027
01:23:08,481 --> 01:23:11,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of people are really thrilled about it.

1028
01:23:11,703 --> 01:23:17,925
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people thought they were going to pull like a Sadako and have it be like telekinetic or something, which no.

1029
01:23:17,925 --> 01:23:22,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I imagine the hook coming down so that little doll could pull it.

1030
01:23:22,626 --> 01:23:22,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1031
01:23:24,742 --> 01:23:29,143
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but no, I think that's the way that I really like how they did it.

1032
01:23:29,143 --> 01:23:35,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a nod to the actual origin, even though I still swear looks like my dad doesn't.

1033
01:23:35,826 --> 01:23:40,887
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks kind of like the actor, but it looks like a picture I have of my dad with his eyes rolled up like that.

1034
01:23:40,887 --> 01:23:45,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I really hope the Tiffany one is Jennifer Tilly likeness.

1035
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:46,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they said it's announced.

1036
01:23:46,809 --> 01:23:47,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

1037
01:23:47,289 --> 01:23:49,170
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed what it looks like.

1038
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I hadn't seen that yet.

1039
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:52,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody, goody, goody.

1040
01:23:52,371 --> 01:23:52,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

1041
01:23:52,651 --> 01:23:52,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

1042
01:23:54,031 --> 01:23:57,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm so excited.

1043
01:23:57,373 --> 01:24:01,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it's fine if you send it out, I'm not going to be able to bring it up, so it's fine.

1044
01:24:01,235 --> 01:24:02,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just I'll take your word for it.

1045
01:24:02,715 --> 01:24:03,676
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm excited.

1046
01:24:03,676 --> 01:24:04,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I knew her voice was in it.

1047
01:24:04,836 --> 01:24:06,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't realize they had announced the likeness too.

1048
01:24:06,797 --> 01:24:07,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed that.

1049
01:24:07,278 --> 01:24:09,079
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, but that's that's great.

1050
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, heck yeah.

1051
01:24:10,119 --> 01:24:10,519
[SPEAKER_06]: That's her.

1052
01:24:10,519 --> 01:24:12,640
[SPEAKER_06]: That's honestly in my dead by daylight.

1053
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I play maybe one game every other day.

1054
01:24:14,641 --> 01:24:19,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if that this this that is going to single handedly make me play the game more.

1055
01:24:19,244 --> 01:24:19,864
[SPEAKER_06]: It will.

1056
01:24:19,864 --> 01:24:21,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'm really excited about that.

1057
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:21,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1058
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:26,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on with some other news in the gaming world.

1059
01:24:26,718 --> 01:24:31,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the Gold Master series from Digital Eclipse.

1060
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:42,062
[SPEAKER_06]: A game that I thought was very good that a lot of people are sleeping on is the Gold Master series, The Making of Karateka, which was released.

1061
01:24:42,062 --> 01:24:43,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, when did that come out?

1062
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:44,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a couple weeks ago?

1063
01:24:44,943 --> 01:24:47,564
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was more like a couple months ago at this point, maybe like six weeks ago.

1064
01:24:48,304 --> 01:24:51,705
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that was the first in the Gold Master Series.

1065
01:24:51,705 --> 01:24:55,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we know that another game is coming in the Gold Master Series.

1066
01:24:55,727 --> 01:25:05,230
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as what the game is going to be, we'll find out on December 6th is when that is going to be announced, what the next game is.

1067
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:13,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, my story that said what that is supposed to tie to is not coming up right now, so I know it's some type of event that's happening.

1068
01:25:14,733 --> 01:25:15,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Awards

1069
01:25:29,318 --> 01:25:29,818
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1070
01:25:29,818 --> 01:25:42,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I and again, I thought the reason why I liked if you want to check out our YouTube channel over at VOG Network, Bobby Blackwolf and I did a deep dive on the making of Karateka together and why we liked it a lot.

1071
01:25:42,802 --> 01:25:51,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, some of the things we'd like to see in a sequel and even theorize some games that could be coming because there were some very interesting cameos that I think lend itself to a hint.

1072
01:25:51,485 --> 01:25:52,485
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll see.

1073
01:25:52,485 --> 01:25:56,447
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, that will be announced on December 6th.

1074
01:25:57,327 --> 01:26:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some game releases.

1075
01:26:00,731 --> 01:26:06,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the last big game release week before we hit Thanksgiving, right?

1076
01:26:06,418 --> 01:26:08,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is gonna be a big one.

1077
01:26:08,461 --> 01:26:14,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, maybe next week there might be some stuff, but once you hit like that Black Friday Thanksgiving week, then it's just...

1078
01:26:15,763 --> 01:26:17,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead.

1079
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:20,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're right, we're looking ahead.

1080

1113
01:30:49,947 --> 01:30:52,509

01:31:12,904 --> 01:31:17,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Heading over to the PlayStation 5 to see what is coming out there.

1118
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:20,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't bother to read Xbox in Japan because there really isn't anything.

1119
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:35,796
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes Sony has a few things and this week that Yohane the Parhelion Blaze in the Deep Blue is also out on PlayStation 5 and Guilty Gear Strive in a 25th anniversary box is out this week from Arc System Works and

1120
01:31:36,696 --> 01:31:42,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's actually, oh no, Persona 5 Tactica also out on the PlayStation 5 this week.

1121
01:31:42,379 --> 01:31:44,940
[SPEAKER_06]: That is it for your Japanese releases.

1122
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:50,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go over to Europe and I need to take a quick, quick AFK while Jamie's reading these dates.

1140
01:33:18,538 --> 01:33:18,998
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be it.

1141
01:33:19,753 --> 01:33:21,374
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big one for the week.

1142
01:33:21,374 --> 01:33:24,195
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people love Bluey.

1143
01:33:24,195 --> 01:33:25,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I have really good timing.

1144
01:33:25,135 --> 01:33:27,376
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1145
01:33:27,376 --> 01:33:37,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go on for a few more news stories, and then we'll open it up for questions and chat and other participation from our live audience, as well as any emails from the podcast folk.

1146
01:33:37,741 --> 01:33:41,503
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have any this week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1147
01:33:41,503 --> 01:33:42,183
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, Loki.

1148
01:33:43,749 --> 01:33:53,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Steam is going to be rolling out a new feature that allows you to mark games as private and hide them from your friends.

1149
01:33:53,011 --> 01:33:58,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, of course, the first thing people think of is like, ah, see, you can hide all your porn games now.

1150
01:33:58,352 --> 01:34:00,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Now no one knows that you can play the dirty games.

1151
01:34:00,733 --> 01:34:09,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I guess no one can know that you play the games that you wrote a petition saying that you'd never play the game, you know, and then you did buy the game and played it.

1152
01:34:12,864 --> 01:34:14,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that'll be coming at some point.

1153
01:34:14,825 --> 01:34:17,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not exactly sure how that's gonna work.

1154
01:34:17,326 --> 01:34:23,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It basically allows you to hide different achievements and stuff that you get.

1155
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:30,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark achievements, various gameplay, and screenshots as private, which is the current settings.

1156
01:34:33,436 --> 01:34:39,217
[SPEAKER_05]: then they're just going to basically allow you to keep it private from everybody.

1157
01:34:39,217 --> 01:34:39,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's cool.

1158
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:43,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can hide the number of hours I have on Dead by Daylight and not be so embarrassed.

1159
01:34:43,718 --> 01:34:45,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can.

1160
01:34:45,298 --> 01:34:47,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.

1161
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:49,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy to hear it.

1162
01:34:49,619 --> 01:34:49,959
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1163
01:34:49,959 --> 01:34:54,540
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not embarrassed at all, because I got most of mine on Stadia.

1164
01:34:54,540 --> 01:34:55,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1165
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:00,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, you've only played like, yeah, and I still kicked your ass.

1166
01:35:00,661 --> 01:35:01,421
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1167
01:35:01,421 --> 01:35:02,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

1168
01:35:05,722 --> 01:35:07,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1169
01:35:07,183 --> 01:35:15,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, one of the biggest complaints about, you know, dancing games is that it's not very accessible for everybody.

1170
01:35:15,029 --> 01:35:19,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And people love music and they love moving however that they can.

1171
01:35:19,212 --> 01:35:24,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Ubisoft is actually doing something a bit right.

1172
01:35:24,755 --> 01:35:27,457
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're doing this.

1173
01:35:27,457 --> 01:35:34,302
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, um, trying to put things in, uh, for, uh,

1174
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:51,211
[SPEAKER_01]: People who have difficulties in movement, they have invited actually over a kid 14 to their Paris studio to test out a version of Just Dance.

1175
01:35:51,211 --> 01:35:57,455
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a muscle wasting condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

1176
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:07,346
[SPEAKER_01]: He is wheelchair-bound, but he has upper body movement.

1177
01:36:07,346 --> 01:36:17,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, he was speaking with some of their choreographers and designers to help create routines for people in the game who are

1178
01:36:18,419 --> 01:36:19,741
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament.

1179
01:36:34,528 --> 01:36:34,808
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot

1180
01:36:52,779 --> 01:37:01,691
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be a long road, I think, to make a game 100% accessible to people, because there's things you can't account for in the game.

1181
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:04,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's how it is.

1182
01:37:04,134 --> 01:37:06,037
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I like is that...

1183
01:37:08,662 --> 01:37:24,685
[SPEAKER_01]: one of their representatives was going and saying that, and her name is Stacey Jenkins, by the way, was that if you are a developer and you're interested in accessibility, you need to listen to disabled people.

1184
01:37:24,685 --> 01:37:28,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, don't make the decision for them, make the decision with them.

1185
01:37:28,566 --> 01:37:32,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their whole goal is that with every iteration,

1186
01:37:33,427 --> 01:37:39,373
[SPEAKER_01]: that they are able to open the audience more and more to the game.

1187
01:37:39,373 --> 01:37:47,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently this team had a really good time playing the game.

1188
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:48,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad.

1189
01:37:50,014 --> 01:37:51,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sounds that sounds neat.

1190
01:37:51,955 --> 01:37:55,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad they found a way to do that and kind of work that out.

1191
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:56,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious.

1192
01:37:56,516 --> 01:38:01,678
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see maybe it open it up to us because you know, Just Dance can be very popular with streamers sometimes.

1193
01:38:01,678 --> 01:38:07,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious to see if we see you know, maybe some streamers that are able to do this game that maybe couldn't do it before.

1194
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:10,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So now that this is an option, so pretty cool.

1195
01:38:10,022 --> 01:38:13,783
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1196
01:38:13,783 --> 01:38:16,144
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's move on to Loki.

1197
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:23,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I am extremely excited about this.

1198
01:38:23,784 --> 01:38:29,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, finally, we're gonna get Grand Theft Auto 6's reveal.

1199
01:38:29,769 --> 01:38:40,357
[SPEAKER_05]: It is supposed to happen, according to Rockstar Games, early December is when they're going to be releasing their first trailer for the next game.

1200
01:38:42,611 --> 01:38:45,813
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is in early December?

1201
01:38:45,813 --> 01:38:51,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Plank, I couldn't think of anything else that happens to be early December that has big trailers in it.

1202
01:38:51,636 --> 01:38:54,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, not one thing starring Geoff Keighley.

1203
01:38:54,817 --> 01:39:00,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm wondering if that will make an appearance there or if they'll just do their own thing.

1204
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:07,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, although what a fucking power move if they release it that morning just before the ceremony.

1205
01:39:07,124 --> 01:39:09,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of a power move.

1206
01:39:09,365 --> 01:39:10,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

1207
01:39:10,606 --> 01:39:10,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean,

1208
01:39:12,628 --> 01:39:15,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be cool to see something like that.

1209
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:20,712
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm excited since it looked, based off the leaked footage, it looked good.

1210
01:39:20,712 --> 01:39:25,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't wait to see the official reveal.

1211
01:39:25,555 --> 01:39:26,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be excited.

1212
01:39:26,535 --> 01:39:27,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll buy it no matter what.

1213
01:39:27,856 --> 01:39:29,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course you will.

1214
01:39:29,377 --> 01:39:32,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I just won't play Grand Theft Auto online.

1215
01:39:32,058 --> 01:39:33,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1216
01:39:33,539 --> 01:39:33,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1217
01:39:35,003 --> 01:39:35,964
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1218
01:39:35,964 --> 01:39:43,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, lastly here tonight, one thing you definitely won't be doing in the near future is participating in Twitch hype chats.

1219
01:39:43,671 --> 01:39:44,331
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1220
01:39:44,331 --> 01:39:51,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Hype chat, you probably don't know it exists because we never talk about it here because I think it's, it's not, it just, it doesn't have a point.

1221
01:39:52,338 --> 01:39:53,479
[SPEAKER_06]: What is Hype Chat?

1222
01:40:11,229 --> 01:40:13,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1223
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:13,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

1224
01:40:13,850 --> 01:40:14,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1225
01:40:14,511 --> 01:40:20,894
[SPEAKER_06]: But now after five months of being out there, it will no longer be available from November 15th.

1226
01:40:20,894 --> 01:40:27,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitch is saying, though, they're going to invest more into cheering and bits, and they make it sound like you will just be able to use bits.

1227
01:40:28,871 --> 01:40:31,193
[SPEAKER_06]: to do what this used to do.

1228
01:40:31,193 --> 01:40:44,122
[SPEAKER_06]: In a tweet, Twitch support wrote, based on the community's feedback, we've decided to depreciate hype chat on, excuse me, deprecate hype chat on November 15th and invest more into cheering and bits going forward.

1229
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:47,665
[SPEAKER_06]: We still believe in the value of pin messages and fast moving chats.

1230
01:40:47,665 --> 01:40:51,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Viewers will be able to pin cheers with bits in the coming weeks.

1231
01:40:51,488 --> 01:40:56,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, it really sounds like they're kind of just shifting it somewhere else, but all right.

1232
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:04,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's obvious that, you know, bits, subs, that's where the money is that people make on Twitch.

1233
01:41:04,635 --> 01:41:06,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that.

1234
01:41:06,937 --> 01:41:09,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, November 15th is the end of that.

1235
01:41:09,778 --> 01:41:16,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say this right now.

1236
01:41:16,021 --> 01:41:22,184
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a say in some of the stuff that goes on on Twitch, make sure that you sign up for Twitch RPG.

1237
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:40,865
[SPEAKER_01]: their research program where they send out surveys or sometimes they'll even actually talk to people directly or they'll have you do input on certain features.

1238
01:41:40,865 --> 01:41:43,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And like for a survey, you know, you might get 500 bits.

1239
01:41:43,827 --> 01:41:45,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 500 bits for a survey.

1240
01:41:45,829 --> 01:41:48,051
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you are under an NDA with it.

1241
01:41:49,165 --> 01:41:55,400
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a way to look at some of these features and have your voice heard about it, whether or not, you know, if you like it or not.

1242
01:41:57,907 --> 01:42:11,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a survey that I guess was under NDA this week, not related to that, but different because I always thought I just thought the concept of NDA was survey was a little silly because I was like, you're not like I'm just agreeing to take the survey.

1243
01:42:11,056 --> 01:42:14,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not citing my name and but what does it matter if this gets out?

1244
01:42:14,078 --> 01:42:14,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

1245
01:42:14,598 --> 01:42:15,178
[SPEAKER_06]: It's weird.

1246
01:42:15,178 --> 01:42:15,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It was weird.

1247
01:42:15,659 --> 01:42:21,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And the questions that I was being asked was not anything that kind of like wasn't already known.

1248
01:42:22,523 --> 01:42:25,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe they just don't want people to know they were surveying on it.

1249
01:42:25,084 --> 01:42:25,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1250
01:42:25,744 --> 01:42:27,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't tell you what it is.

1251
01:42:27,744 --> 01:42:42,387
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there were a game that I played a lot of and talked about a lot, it's very likely that company is going to target me for one of these surveys because I play a lot of this game.

1252
01:42:42,387 --> 01:42:46,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, something to think about.

1253
01:42:46,208 --> 01:42:46,768
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1254
01:42:46,768 --> 01:42:49,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1255
01:42:49,209 --> 01:42:50,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

1256
01:42:50,509 --> 01:42:50,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead.

1257
01:42:52,895 --> 01:42:53,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, then.

1258
01:42:53,564 --> 01:42:53,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1259
01:42:54,571 --> 01:42:57,993
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to the listener round table.

1260
01:42:57,993 --> 01:43:00,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to invite you all to participate with our show.

1261
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:02,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we get your emails.

1262
01:43:02,937 --> 01:43:05,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Participate at orangelawntrading.com.

1263
01:43:05,438 --> 01:43:09,501
[SPEAKER_06]: We also love to hear from you in our chat room if you have anything you want to ask.

1264
01:43:09,501 --> 01:43:16,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, there is always Discord, vognetwork.com slash discord if you want to say hello that way.

1265
01:43:16,686 --> 01:43:17,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go over.

1266
01:43:17,286 --> 01:43:18,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The mailbox is empty.

1267
01:43:18,827 --> 01:43:20,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I figured that was the case.

1268
01:43:20,889 --> 01:43:22,129
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a graveyard.

1269
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:22,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1270
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:28,013
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's that's good because you're probably not ready to use your voice all the time just yet.

1271
01:43:28,013 --> 01:43:32,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So no YYR emails to test that tonight.

1272
01:43:32,997 --> 01:43:36,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be on Dead by Daylight, but I'm not going to do very much.

1273
01:43:36,799 --> 01:43:43,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might just switch over to Dreamlight Valley because my voice is already feeling it, if you can hear.

1274
01:43:43,804 --> 01:43:45,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my nebulizer though.

1275
01:43:59,601 --> 01:44:03,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Sj100 Matt says YYR will email about the DDR stuff soon enough.

1276
01:44:20,216 --> 01:44:21,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know what I should say.

1277
01:44:21,417 --> 01:44:25,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm like, thanks to Pokemon Go.

1278
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:30,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure why YYR would be available right now based on some things I've observed in Pokemon Go.

1279
01:44:30,122 --> 01:44:31,243
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I can say.

1280
01:44:31,243 --> 01:44:36,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So but anyway, I look forward to possibly hearing from YYR next week.

1281
01:44:36,066 --> 01:44:41,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So but let me see if there might be any last minute stories this week, Loki.

1282
01:44:41,349 --> 01:44:42,530
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not.

1283
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:43,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1284
01:44:43,391 --> 01:44:44,351
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1285
01:44:44,351 --> 01:44:47,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's it's gonna be a very, very busy.

1286
01:44:47,933 --> 01:44:48,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, Jimmy.

1287
01:44:50,862 --> 01:44:52,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said, um, not me either.

1288
01:44:52,483 --> 01:44:53,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1289
01:44:53,543 --> 01:45:01,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's going to be a very, very busy week in, um, the gaming world with, uh, you know, Thanksgiving on the horizon and all these releases.

1290
01:45:01,967 --> 01:45:07,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Super Mario RPG, lot of people going to be giving you their hot takes this weekend.

1291
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:11,131
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand I'm probably going to be one of them, uh, really looking forward to that.

1292
01:45:11,131 --> 01:45:18,475
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is, this is in a way it's kind of the, the capstone week of what has been an awesome year in game releases.

1293
01:45:19,235 --> 01:45:19,575
[SPEAKER_06]: GameReleases

1294
01:45:44,168 --> 01:45:46,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Review of this.

1295
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:47,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

1296
01:45:47,689 --> 01:45:51,730
[SPEAKER_05]: There's usually not anything too big.

1297
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:57,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes Nintendo will sneak a small, small thing out, but a lot of yeah, what I'm looking at is sports.

1298
01:45:57,212 --> 01:46:00,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I get the official release of Disney Dreamlight Valley.

1299
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:02,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a stretch.

1300
01:46:02,033 --> 01:46:04,054
[SPEAKER_05]: The Avatar game.

1301
01:46:04,054 --> 01:46:05,314
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1302
01:46:05,314 --> 01:46:06,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Is a thing, I guess.

1303
01:46:09,724 --> 01:46:11,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1304
01:46:17,217 --> 01:46:19,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And be done with it and make me happy.

1305
01:46:19,299 --> 01:46:21,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd like to see that too, honestly.

1306
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:23,101
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a lot of development.

1307
01:46:23,101 --> 01:46:26,403
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people aren't releasing MMOs anymore.

1308
01:46:26,403 --> 01:46:33,988
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's something coming from some of the folks that used to work on World of Warcraft kind of split off and did their own thing some time ago.

1309
01:46:33,988 --> 01:46:37,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we're supposed to, rumor is, we're supposed to see something on that.

1310
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:40,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if that's tied with the Game Awards too.

1311
01:46:40,392 --> 01:46:45,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on some tweets and things of that nature, I feel like they're due to announce it soon.

1312
01:46:46,595 --> 01:46:49,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wonder if that's going to be coming out of the Game Awards as well.

1313
01:46:49,256 --> 01:46:50,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'd be very interesting.

1314
01:46:50,937 --> 01:47:00,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you, SSJ100 Matt, for the update on the countdown timer, who says in chat, we are only 50 days away from Bobby Kotick leaving the industry.

1315
01:47:00,201 --> 01:47:01,001
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1316
01:47:01,001 --> 01:47:01,541
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 days away.

1317
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:05,203
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 days too long, but the day is getting closer.

1318
01:47:05,203 --> 01:47:05,663
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sure.

1319
01:47:07,287 --> 01:47:10,728
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, we will start to wrap up the show tonight.

1320
01:47:10,728 --> 01:47:13,529
[SPEAKER_06]: First, let me thank all of you for listening to the show tonight.

1321
01:47:13,529 --> 01:47:18,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for listening, whether it was live or whether it was on the podcast feed.

1322
01:47:18,651 --> 01:47:22,492
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate you taking a moment to check out our show and be with us this week.

1323
01:47:22,492 --> 01:47:25,653
[SPEAKER_06]: If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

1324
01:47:25,653 --> 01:47:30,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1325
01:47:30,534 --> 01:47:31,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So please tell a friend or two.

1326
01:47:31,975 --> 01:47:36,056
[SPEAKER_06]: A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way as well.

1327
01:47:37,156 --> 01:47:43,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to DarkSakura, because I know you're setting up, as you just said, to do some Dead by Daylight for a little bit, and maybe some other stuff too.

1328
01:47:43,858 --> 01:47:46,139
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a final thought for us tonight.

1329
01:47:46,139 --> 01:47:48,099
[SPEAKER_01]: See how I feel.

1330
01:47:48,099 --> 01:47:54,381
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought is don't be a shit to other people.

1331
01:47:54,381 --> 01:47:57,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen to what people tell you.

1332
01:47:57,141 --> 01:48:01,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't live in a echo chamber.

1333
01:48:01,042 --> 01:48:02,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look outside of your own bias.

1334
01:48:05,587 --> 01:48:09,590
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, have a good stream.

1335
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:12,352
[SPEAKER_06]: We will we will move over to Loki.

1336
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:14,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Your final thought tonight, Loki?

1337
01:48:14,793 --> 01:48:20,077
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I have a lot of editing to do this week.

1338
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:21,798
[SPEAKER_06]: More Minecraft videos to do, yeah?

1339
01:48:21,798 --> 01:48:28,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got like one Channel 64 video and probably like one or two of the Deep Dark World stuff.

1340
01:48:28,282 --> 01:48:29,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a lot.

1341
01:48:29,929 --> 01:48:31,270
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, busy, busy.

1342
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:35,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope I hope the engagement is continuing its climb.

1343
01:48:35,113 --> 01:48:37,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's been a slow climb, but it's climb over there.

1344
01:48:37,155 --> 01:48:40,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's moving up.

1345
01:48:40,257 --> 01:48:46,543
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, gradually, like barely, you know, it's it's flat as flat as can be, you know.

1346
01:48:46,543 --> 01:48:48,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, every little bit helps.

1347
01:48:48,724 --> 01:48:53,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you continue to find that engagement and maybe that one thing that breaks through.

1348
01:48:53,668 --> 01:48:54,789
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

1349
01:48:54,789 --> 01:48:55,410
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.

1350
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:56,210
[SPEAKER_06]: More shorts.

1351
01:48:56,210 --> 01:48:56,831
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it takes.

1352
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Meh.

1353
01:49:20,828 --> 01:49:25,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just figured Niantic just can't get anything right at this point.

1354
01:49:25,111 --> 01:49:26,412
[SPEAKER_06]: But damn, I still play.

1355
01:49:26,412 --> 01:49:28,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I still play way too much of their games.

1356
01:49:28,593 --> 01:49:29,314
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

1357
01:49:29,314 --> 01:49:31,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I love to gamify my walks and my fitness.

1358
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:32,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It works.

1359
01:49:32,676 --> 01:49:35,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, that does it, everybody.

1360
01:49:35,298 --> 01:49:36,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a wonderful week.

1361
01:49:36,218 --> 01:49:42,883
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you in seven days to do it all again and probably talk an awful lot about Super Mario RPG.

1362
01:49:42,883 --> 01:49:47,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sure those of you that are picking that up later this week will have a lot to say about it.

1363
01:49:47,626 --> 01:49:49,567
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll talk about it next time.

1364
01:49:49,567 --> 01:49:50,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good night, everybody.

1365
01:49:50,388 --> 01:49:50,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1366
01:49:51,889 --> 01:49:56,412
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1367
01:49:56,412 --> 01:50:01,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

1368
01:50:01,536 --> 01:50:10,383
[SPEAKER_04]: To join us for our live show, tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

1369
01:50:10,383 --> 01:50:19,890
[SPEAKER_04]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio nor VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.
