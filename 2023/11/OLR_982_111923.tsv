9898	14120	My Gaming Week has been waiting for Super Mario RPG all week, and then getting it on Friday.
14120	17322	My Gaming Weekend has been playing Super Mario RPG all weekend.
17322	18642	It's been a good Geek Week.
18642	24385	Super Mario RPG, Scott Pilgrim takes off, award season announcements, Half-Life updates, and so much more.
24385	28547	It truly is the most wonderful time to edge still closer to the end of the year.
28547	29928	This is the Voice of Geeks intro.
29928	37152	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somers, and Loki to tell you about most of these things and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, wherever your gamer has a voice.
38891	41412	Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.
41412	46794	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46794	49736	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49736	52037	We are live once again tonight.
52037	62541	Episode 982 of our show, November 19th of 2023 or 19 November, as we might have joked about many years ago.
62541	65843	I'm Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you all tonight with my co-host.
65843	68204	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
71806	73427	who is not coming through for some reason.
73427	78611	Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
78611	79812	On mute.
79812	80573	Okay, there you go.
80573	81433	Hi, how are you?
81433	82074	Hello.
82074	82374	Hi.
82374	90140	I'm irritated, apparently, with whatever's going on with the system.
90140	91661	Yeah, fun.
91661	96384	I love the shirt that your VTuber is wearing with Bad Cat.
96384	99187	I like the outfit that your VTuber is in tonight.
99187	99587	It's cute.
101906	102266	Thanks.
102266	104208	I made it last night.
104208	104888	Wonderful.
104888	106609	Wonderful.
106609	107530	Also say hello.
107530	108470	Joining us every week.
108470	110412	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
110412	111012	Hello.
111012	111532	Hi, Loki.
111532	112593	How are you?
112593	114615	I'm good.
114615	117777	We have tech problems all over the place tonight because your video is frozen for us.
117777	122940	Because I was going to say, why do you just have a static Simpsons bowling logo behind you tonight?
122940	130085	Well, it's because XSplit VCam has been stupid for the last, I don't know how long.
130385	136629	I guess I guess since a lot of people take the next week off of work, a lot of our technical equipment decided to do the same.
136629	137109	What can you say?
137109	140071	Well, this has been doing this for weeks now, so I don't know.
140071	150316	It's a combination between the software just sucking in also between, I think, Windows and assigning like device IDs to USB devices.
150316	154118	Like it seems like every time I get an update that it resets everything.
154118	156420	And so that's probably part of it.
157625	174277	Well, if you want to join us live to point and laugh at all the tech fail, you sure can, because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, where we do tape live right after Bobby Blackwolf Show on Sunday nights.
174277	177139	You starting to say something, Jamie?
177139	185025	Yeah, actually, I know I need to do my system upgrade and upgrade my OBS.
185025	186646	So for me, it could just be an OBS issue.
186994	189396	Hmm, maybe, maybe.
189396	190176	All right.
190176	192638	Well, let's get into some news.
192638	200383	We don't have as much news this week with, you know, this was a big week for game releases, as Jason kind of talked about in the intro there.
200383	205607	Super Mario RPG, I know, is taking over a lot of people's gaming weeks this weekend.
205607	206988	Sadly, not mine.
206988	208569	I just I had some other stuff going on.
208569	209830	I didn't get around to it yet.
209830	211031	I plan to.
211031	214053	Probably something I'll get to in the next week.
214053	215374	But, you know, that was
215974	222784	With that and the releases this week, the rest of them, it's really kind of the last big releases of the year.
222784	225288	I think we have an Avatar game out in December.
225288	228592	I don't think I'd put that in the big release category, even if it is based off a big movie.
228592	231917	Yeah, Ubisoft does weird December releases for some reason for their games.
231997	235359	I mean, Mario RPG was really the last big, big release of the year.
235359	244686	So now it's kind of like, OK, finally, this year of just really behemoth game releases has been put down in front of us.
244686	251390	We now can take a look back at the year 2023, which has really been a fantastic year for gaming releases.
251390	253752	Not such a great year for gaming studios.
253752	255973	We kind of have to juggle both of those things.
255973	259676	And we'll talk a little bit more about that a little later in the program.
260316	266758	But we can talk about celebrating some of the great releases of the year this year with the Game Awards.
266758	276041	And the Game Awards, of course, been running for a few years now, trying to be to the video game industry what basically the Oscars is to movies.
276041	276421	I would say
277381	289685	Maybe more what the Grammys is to me, even though I can't stand the Grammys, but you know, it's trying to go, because it's a little bit less formal than the Oscars, but maybe something like, or maybe the Emmys, I don't know, the Golden Globes, it's a little less formal.
289685	292086	Again, they've had their own set of problems over the years.
292086	294566	I don't know if any of those are... I prefer the Golden Girls.
294566	297827	The Golden Girls of Must See TV.
299688	311938	No, but obviously Jeff Keighley started the Game Awards a few years ago to really try to bring a little bit more pomp, circumstance, and of course, you know, recognition to the industry in a little bit more of a formal way.
311938	315020	We had Game Award shows before.
315020	317843	The G4 Network had that G4ia thing.
317843	321305	Spike TV did something, and I don't even remember what it was called.
321305	325369	It was the... I think they just called it like the Game Awards.
325369	326489	It was like the Spike TV...
328567	333250	Yeah, and it'll show you what a great impression it made on all of us that we can't even remember.
333250	335271	Oh, VGA says Bobby Blackwold.
335271	336172	Oh, that's right.
336172	337853	So that sounds familiar now.
337853	338233	Yeah.
338233	345178	So, you know, obviously those were trying to be a little bit too much, you know, what they think the people want to see.
345758	352301	And the Game Awards, you know, love him or hate him, Jeff Keighley, I think, has a much bigger pulse on what gamers kind of want to see.
352301	361245	And that's a good mix of the awards, the speeches that go with them, and the big trailers, the must-see, you know, game announcement trailers, because, you know,
362125	362586	Grand Theft Auto 6
378190	384675	I remember when we first had the trailer for No Man's Sky, that just came out of nowhere.
384675	386576	I was like, what the heck is this?
386576	388577	This is amazing.
388577	388978	I do.
388978	398404	Well, I even think just as recently as last year, like the Death Stranding 2 trailer, because a lot of the rumors were pointing that Kojima was doing a horror game.
398804	427804	and so people were kind of expecting that and then what we kind of got instead was very different until that moment you see Norman Reedus and then it's like oh this is Death Stranding 2 so um you know there's been there's been some pretty um pretty exciting announcements over the years and uh it looks like this year we'll we'll get some more so but tied in with that is the awards themselves and some people kind of get excited about the awards some people can kind of give or take them i don't know i don't know if excited the right word because how do i feel about the awards
429064	430665	I like that they happen.
430665	431685	I do.
431685	446112	Even though it's very hard to judge art in this kind of way, I do think Jeff has set up a good show to recognize the industry and to give a little clout for, you know, like an award and that type of thing.
446112	449193	That is, yeah, that's cool.
450874	452915	So, you know, do they always get it right?
452915	458416	No, but neither do the Oscars, neither do the Grammys or any of those shows get it right.
458416	465618	So let's talk a little bit about what did get nominated this year and try to talk a little bit about what all goes into that.
465618	468919	Loki, do you want to kind of highlight maybe some key categories for us?
468919	470539	I don't think we need to, because there's a lot of categories.
470539	473200	I don't think we need to do it all, but maybe some of the key categories.
474147	474968	Yeah, let's see here.
474968	479371	So, some of the categories, obviously, Game of the Year.
479371	487698	One of the contentious, not contentious, surprising, I guess, things about Game of the Year is that Starfield is not nominated for Game of the Year.
487698	496005	So we have Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, I mean, Baldur's Gate 3, and even Alan Wake 2, I think are pretty, like, that makes sense.
496005	499388	Spider-Man 2, Resident Evil 4, Super Mario Bros.
499388	501710	Wonder, and The Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom.
503797	504878	Starfield gets ignored in Game of the Year
519190	519530	and Buggy.
542648	547711	The most shocking omission to me is an indie title.
547711	555436	I would have thought that something like Sea of Stars, Cocoon, something in those lines sneaks in here.
555436	557557	But I'm not that shocked.
557557	561700	Like when you mentioned these six games, I'm like, I'm not that shocked.
561700	563361	Have I played all these games?
563361	564081	No.
564081	571525	Do I feel like I listen to people enough and have a pulse enough on social media and all that that this list of six surprises me?
571525	572286	No, it doesn't.
572846	577010	and I think this seems like a fine and to be expected list.
577010	583115	That being said, I think it's going to be the biggest non-surprise when Baldur's Gate 3 walks away with it.
583115	583795	I hope it does.
583795	584956	That'd be amazing.
584956	592002	Well, you know, and I see a lot of great things about that game winning too, especially when you talk about a lot of the industry stuff that's been going on this year.
592002	599308	Larian is a studio that really took the time to get it right, didn't crunch, made sure they put out a polished product that was very rich without the DLC.
600069	606256	Here's the thing, I can say all that and at the same time recognize, some of you may have remembered, I attempted to stream that on my channel.
606256	609840	I made a big deal out of it and was like, oh, Shane and I are going to do multiplayer.
609840	616028	I canceled it after two streams and not like for a lazy reason, but for a, I'm not having fun reason.
617289	633840	And I know that might sound shocking to say, but if you go back and listen to what we were saying, I said, this game is almost too open-ended where I'm able to make these mistakes live on air that are not fun to watch me go and recover from, and I'm not feeling like I'm moving forward at all whatsoever in this game.
634620	639881	So I don't really want to play this game until I have an FAQ that could just walk me the whole way through the game.
639881	655085	That being said, I can still have that personal opinion of my issues with it, and at the same time recognize, damn, this is like playing a Bioware game at its best, which is no, you know, if you consider the history of that series, there's no surprise there.
655085	659206	But it's got great character development, great voice acting, great story.
659206	663627	It literally feels like you're in the middle of a tabletop D&D campaign.
664187	666949	So they got so much right with that game.
666949	668570	It really does to me.
668570	671431	Go ahead.
671431	673032	Oh, no, I was agreeing with you.
673032	683339	I started the game and I've been busy, but every impression I've got down to the dice rolls and the narration of just being in a really good game.
683339	684299	Yeah, exactly.
684299	690383	And I think especially now at this time when a lot more people have been getting into tabletop game, I think in part
690723	691104	Baldur's Gate 3
710143	725162	any like Dark Horse or whatever you want to call it, maybe Alan Wake 2 just because it seems to be riding a lot of recency buzz and there's a lot of like artistic decisions in that game that seem to be very very well done including the soundtrack
725843	726343	and Zelda.
744691	746014	None of those other four are winning.
746014	746314	I'm sorry.
746314	747076	I will be shocked.
747076	748979	I mean, anything can happen.
748979	755331	You know, we've had shock Oscar wins before, but I would be absolutely shocked if one of the other four won.
755331	755731	Shocked.
756670	760571	because that would mean somehow the Nintendo vote didn't split.
760571	762892	That is actually the most surprising thing to me.
762892	768654	I don't think we've had two Nintendo games nominated in the same year since.
768654	770174	I think it did happen one other time.
770174	771855	Oh, it was Zelda and Mario.
771855	775916	It was when Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey went up against each other.
776636	781781	So it's it's taken those two coming out in the same year to go up against each other again.
781781	784563	And that and that's I actually think Wonder is great.
784563	786905	And I think I think they're both great.
786905	791849	But I am still surprised to see them both nominated because usually Nintendo kind of splits those type of awards.
791849	798815	So anyway, let's see other categories we can talk about.
798815	799936	So adaptation.
799936	802779	So this is basically games to other media like
805825	813311	Castlevania Nocturne, the Netflix animated series, Gran Turismo, The Last of Us, Super Mario Bros.
813311	814772	Movie, Twisted Metal
825380	834867	Sadly a little too late for the Scott Pilgrim anime, but that may be something that's next year.
834867	838009	Well, Scott Pilgrim also isn't based on a game.
838009	840391	Scott Pilgrim was a game, but it was a manga first.
841092	842173	Yeah, that's true.
842173	844995	But I could see them doing it.
844995	847837	Um, let's see best best independent game.
847837	852240	So we have Cocoon, Dave the Diver, Dredge, Sea of Stars.
852240	860946	I'm gonna make you go back because I do want to comment real quick on the adaptation thing because there was a spirited debate about it in our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you want to join
861346	888480	the conversation throughout the week and this is one of the conversations they were talking about because we had one listener who was pretty passionate that Mario is the best adaptation and ought to win and some other folks that are like dude there's no way The Last of Us doesn't win this and I can completely like you know again I really try to put myself in other people's shoes that's you know for all the Rob Stradamus jokes I've been getting this year one way I try to act make the predictions best I can is try to look at things from other perspectives and so forth
888940	892183	And I totally see why somebody would like something like the Mario movie.
892183	899170	It was a good movie, and it's family-friendly, it's cute, it's fun, it's self-referential to video games.
899170	900051	I get it.
900051	906077	That being said, I also look at something like The Last of Us, and the way that that is breaking through
906778	914587	to an audience of people, an artistic, if you want to say, the Oscar voting category, the Emmy voting category.
914587	920774	The Last of Us is breaking through in a way video game adaptations just don't fucking do.
920774	921435	And I think as
922336	927021	I think most people of a certain age at this point understand video games are fun.
927021	927942	Video games are fun.
927942	928563	They're silly.
928563	930966	They're entertaining, right?
930966	936372	I don't think everybody in that same group also understands video games are also art.
936372	941097	And video games can tell very good, moving, emotional stories.
941758	949663	But The Last of Us has now pushed that through in a way into that more mainstream medium that I don't think video game adaptations have done yet.
949663	953405	So that's why I think The Last of Us, easy win in that category.
953405	954606	Easy, easy win.
954606	960250	While I can still respect the perspective of family fun, popcorn should be worth something.
960250	963312	Yes, but it's going to be Last of Us' year.
963312	963432	So.
964622	965462	Yeah, I think so.
965462	967183	I mean, I like the Super Mario Bros.
967183	974007	movie, but I could also see that it's a very... Like, it's not going to be touted for its writing or anything like that.
974007	976949	Like, it's a good adaptation, but it's not like...
978573	980134	a great movie.
980134	992183	It's a good movie, but it's not like, you know, one that you go back to like, wow, this is, you know, incredibly written, incredibly animated, you know, such a great story and great characters and all that stuff.
992183	994224	It's just very surface.
994224	997667	Well, if you have an eight year old at home, it's something you can put on at loop to entertain them.
999208	1001510	Yeah, I mean, it's there's nothing wrong with it.
1001510	1002931	No, it's not.
1002931	1005113	It's just, you know, there's nothing wrong with entertainment.
1005113	1006854	And there's, there's nothing wrong.
1006854	1015161	Like, literally, why on earth would anyone ever watch either a soap opera, or pro wrestling, because those are essentially the same thing.
1015161	1017803	Why do people watch either one of those things?
1017803	1021406	Because sometimes you just want to shut your fucking brain off and be entertained.
1021406	1024208	Okay, there's nothing wrong with that at all.
1026260	1027381	Loki, you're frozen again, by the way.
1027381	1029823	I can't see your reactions and it's killing me.
1029823	1030524	Sorry.
1030524	1031285	I don't know.
1031285	1032926	I don't know what to do with this.
1032926	1035068	It's just being stupid.
1035068	1036149	It's all right.
1036149	1039592	Have to keep refreshing it and be like, Hey, remember, there's a camera attached to this.
1039592	1041954	It's like, Oh, okay.
1041954	1042335	All right.
1042335	1044877	Anyway, sorry, you were starting to read another category before I cut you off.
1045680	1047401	Yeah, let's see.
1047401	1050844	So, Best Indie Game.
1050844	1052545	They're talking about this in chat right now.
1052545	1056547	I got to... Yeah, there's contention here too.
1056547	1063092	So, Cocoon, Dave the Diver, Dredge, Sea of Stars, and Viewfinder.
1063092	1071958	And the problem here, I think, that people have had is Dave the Diver is... Mint Rocket is owned by Tencent, I believe.
1071958	1072558	So, it's like...
1074554	1076115	Are you really an indie studio?
1076115	1078135	I think that they're treated like an indie studio.
1078135	1079636	It's Nexon, but it's Nexon, not Tencent.
1079636	1081596	Oh, Nexon.
1081596	1083297	But it's a massive company.
1083297	1090679	And actually, if you want to take that one step further, it was either the producer, the director, somebody made a comment on Twitter that essentially said, this isn't an indie game.
1090679	1096261	It's intentionally set up to look like an indie game, but they actually have a tweet out there that is like, this is not an indie game.
1096261	1098362	Now, for what it's worth, it won't win.
1098962	1099662	Thank you
1122791	1131234	The onus is going to be on Jeff to better define what that means in the next year.
1131234	1132915	What does it mean to be an indie?
1132915	1137037	Does it mean you have a certain amount of money or less circling around?
1137037	1144620	I'd be very curious to hear him better define what is that other than what it seems to be right now, which is a vibe.
1146365	1148227	And that's a vibe.
1148227	1150289	What makes an indie game a vibe?
1150289	1152271	Because that's what Dave the Diver was going for.
1152271	1158677	I'm not knocking the game, but when they come out and say it's not an indie game, it was just a vibe.
1158677	1161820	That's a problem.
1161820	1166844	Anyway.
1166844	1167705	Next category.
1171257	1178078	Well, we'll do these two because, uh, at least the first one's not necessarily my cup of tea, but best mobile game.
1178078	1187180	So they have Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, which was that the, uh, the MOBA game?
1187180	1193622	Like the, was that one that they like, no, I don't think this is the one that they shut down, the live service one.
1193622	1194142	No.
1194142	1194202	Um,
1195168	1204416	Honkai StarRail, Hello Kitty Island Adventure, Monster Hunter Now, and TerraNil.
1204416	1206418	And the best VR AR game.
1206418	1209921	Wait, because you know I got something to say on everything, Loki.
1209921	1212463	I'm sure nothing about Monster Hunter Now, of course not.
1212463	1215446	Well, no, I mean, obviously, obviously I've been playing quite a bit of that game.
1215446	1217647	It doesn't mean I don't know.
1217647	1221171	It's hard for me to judge the criteria of what makes a good mobile game.
1221171	1222432	I play very few of them.
1223032	1230139	I will tell you why I think Monster Hunter Now is actually a decent candidate, because it's something, again, unique to the mobile experience.
1230139	1235284	I'm not so sure a game like Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, I'm sure it's a fine game.
1235284	1238547	What is it really bringing that's unique to mobile?
1238547	1241970	And I'd like to see the games judged a little more on that.
1243912	1244553	Thank you for watching!
1258143	1260064	above some of those other games that got nominated for me.
1276954	1282178	I'm actually legit shocked that was not in more discussions when we talked about Game of the Year.
1282178	1290305	And I really think Street Fighter 6 is a perfect example of a game that got lost in 2023, which really sucks for some people.
1290305	1293007	So I'm glad to see it there and I think it ought to win.
1293007	1296490	And you all know I love Diablo 4.
1296490	1299133	I stand that game a lot harder than most people think I should.
1299793	1308758	I can say all that and completely recognize multiplayer is actually I think its weakest part because the leveling system is not designed as smart as it was in 3.
1308758	1313381	So I actually don't think Diablo 4 ought to win best multiplayer.
1313381	1318324	So go go Street Fighter 6 go ahead.
1318324	1318364	Um,
1319522	1319582	and
1334462	1337244	HiFiRush got a surprising amount of nominations.
1337244	1343727	And you know, when that game first came out, people were saying Game of the Year, but then, you know, the rest of 2023 happened.
1343727	1347510	But I think it still got something like five nominations or something like that.
1347510	1360357	For all the talk about the Microsoft hate in the, you know, Game of the Year or whatever, HiFiRush still did very well for itself, considering how much hype went into building up that game, which was literally none.
1360357	1361298	It was a stealth release.
1361778	1362599	Dead Island 2
1378353	1379374	Let's see what else.
1379374	1381175	How about best RPG?
1381175	1389240	So that's where we get Baldur's Gate 3, Final Fantasy 16, Lies of Pea, Sea of Stars and Starfield.
1389240	1390421	So that's quite a lineup.
1390421	1393123	Is there any doubt what wins in that category?
1393123	1393984	Is there any doubt?
1393984	1397206	Yeah, it's going to be Final Fantasy 16, but like, or Baldur's Gate 3.
1397206	1401629	Yeah, Baldur's Gate 3, easily.
1401629	1404371	Let's do the performance, and then that's probably the last one we need to talk about.
1406371	1409072	Best Performance, we have Ben Starr for Final Fantasy XVI
1426860	1430743	Cameron Monaghan for Star Wars Jedi Survivor.
1430743	1434926	He's actually pretty good too, so I'd like to see either one of them.
1434926	1438689	Idris Elba for Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty.
1438689	1449277	We have Melanie Lybird for Alan Wake 2, Neil Newborn for Baldur's Gate 3, and Yuri Lowenthal for Spider-Man 2.
1452305	1458927	I think it really comes down to Ben Starr and the voice actor for Asterion in Baldur's Gate.
1458927	1472553	It's between the two of them because they both just won an award at a comparable ceremony overseas, but Asterion was best supporting and Clive was best leading or whatever you want to say.
1472553	1474014	So I think it comes down to the two of them.
1475255	1481669	I wonder if Ben Starr's very smart social media presence
1482642	1483882	doesn't help him take this.
1483882	1488403	You know, it's interesting because the fans only get 10% of the vote.
1488403	1490264	The jury votes for the other 90%.
1490264	1494545	But this is one where I could see that that 10% makes a difference.
1494545	1499906	But I also think Baldur's Gate has just as many fans as Ben Starr does.
1499906	1501666	So I think it's going to be a tough call for many people.
1501666	1511169	But I think there's going to be people that kind of are swayed towards Ben Starr because he has played the social media game so, so well since.
1511169	1511989	Because think about it.
1512509	1519014	Ben Starr's voice acting career, he has like one well known thing on his resume, one.
1519014	1521076	And look what he's turned that into.
1521076	1524418	He's, he's, he's very, very smart.
1524418	1527240	I'm going to give him that and he can very well take this award.
1527240	1530223	And I think I don't think any I don't think anybody would complain.
1530223	1535507	I think even the Baldur's Gate 3 fans would say like, look, if we're going to lose to anybody, it's going to be Ben Starr.
1535507	1536348	So and that
1537468	1542992	And, you know, and that sucks because there's actually a lot of other great talent in there, too.
1542992	1544232	I forget the character name.
1544232	1549896	The gal they added in Alan Wake 2 that she voices in that game apparently is a great character.
1549896	1553938	But it's just like, unfortunately, these other characters are like it's coming down to those two.
1553938	1557700	They're just going to get lost in the Ben Starr and, you know, Asterion debate.
1557700	1558981	So that's what it is.
1561055	1563696	Yeah, actually Questbuster brings up a great point.
1563696	1569437	I'm surprised Ralph Innocent wasn't nominated too from Final Fantasy 16.
1569437	1570698	Or how about Diablo 4?
1570698	1572838	Because he was also in that game and did very well.
1572838	1574759	I thought he was great as Sid.
1574759	1575579	Yes.
1575579	1581601	So this is interesting that we don't consider people's body of work with this award.
1581601	1589763	Because maybe if we had considered what Ralph Innocent did this year, Innocent, Innocent, what all he did this year, he actually would be up he had some
1590383	1598367	Keep in mind, Final Fantasy and Diablo 4 were released weeks apart, and he played memorable characters in both of those games.
1598367	1601408	That's a good year for that guy.
1601408	1605610	It's a little surprising to not see him in this list.
1605610	1607511	Not that I would want to take anybody else off of it.
1611050	1613253	It's going to be an interesting year.
1613253	1614034	We'll see.
1614034	1624566	SSJ100Math in chat has been looking at some of the like the betting, you know, the the I guess there's, you know, CD websites you can go to if you want.
1624566	1625406	I shouldn't say CD.
1625406	1628370	It is legal in some places, but I don't know how I feel about all that stuff.
1628710	1632332	But you can go look at what the odds makers are saying about these sorts of races.
1632332	1636755	NSJ100 Matt says the betting odds for Ben Starr to win are pretty high.
1636755	1641117	Bobby Blackwell says hopefully this means at least Ben Starr will present an award.
1641117	1642598	I just want Ben Starr on stage.
1644301	1652144	You know, I think of the MTV Movie Awards and how they used to do like parodies and things that would actually have big celebrities in them.
1652144	1660466	Like, you know, you ever seen some of those skits that they would do on the awards, they'd have, you know, I would love to see Ben Starr in the Zelda movie.
1660466	1665508	Like they should show him auditioning for the part of Link in the Zelda movie, I think would be very funny.
1667455	1667735	Saga Andersen
1688886	1690046	Oh, is that related?
1690046	1700689	Well, apparently it's more like you will understand Alan Wake 2 without having played Control, but my friend is more like Control is the best video game I've ever played.
1700689	1704430	And if you don't play that before you play Alan Wake 2, I'm going to be mad at you type of thing.
1704430	1706270	So yeah, I understand.
1706270	1709591	But but but apparently there is benefit to having played both.
1709591	1713432	That is also interesting.
1713432	1715953	Yeah, there's a little bit of a universe there.
1715953	1716093	So
1719214	1725922	MikeDef says control is not needed to understand Alan Wake 2, but it is connected because of DLC.
1725922	1732870	Questbuster says there are references, but you don't absolutely need to play it first.
1732870	1736535	Bonce006 with a good point, the Halo TV series got no mention.
1736535	1737596	Ouch, wasn't that last year though?
1738416	1739376	Yeah, I think that was last year.
1739376	1740337	That wasn't this year.
1740337	1741637	Yeah, but you know what?
1741637	1746558	I had a very similar reaction because I was like, where was the League of Legends anime?
1746558	1747659	Everybody went crazy.
1747659	1750760	Why is the League of Legends anime not... It was because it won last year.
1750760	1755361	Because my sense of time is so fucked these days.
1755361	1760382	Well, to be fair, there are so many spinoffs of League of Legends nowadays.
1760382	1763143	I think there is even maybe multiple animated series.
1763143	1765304	So it's very possible to like...
1766264	1766965	Miss something.
1766965	1768007	Which is Arcane, by the way.
1768007	1769650	I can never remember the name.
1769650	1775860	Yeah, I remember Arcane, but I swear that we talked about it in release dates last week even, or this week.
1775860	1780648	There was another spinoff game for League of Legends, so there's a lot of spinoffs there.
1780648	1780768	Yeah.
1782230	1787232	But hey, if the quality is as good as what Arcane apparently was, we can see why.
1787232	1790713	Anyway, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week.
1790713	1792573	Thank you for running that down for us, Loki.
1792573	1796294	December 7th is the date of the awards ceremony.
1796294	1803076	Mr. Blackwolf and I, and potentially my co-hosts here, need to talk about who might want to get together and stream that live for live reactions.
1803076	1807878	Not just of these awards, but of these trailers, because there's going to be some big things announced.
1807878	1809898	So I know... Please!
1809898	1810579	I need it!
1810579	1811519	I need it in my blood!
1812379	1817461	Loki, here's the thing, even if you don't get Grand Theft Auto at the Game Awards, you know you're getting it in early December.
1817461	1819482	They did confirm that, so you're gonna get it.
1819482	1821903	It's just, we're thinking it's gonna be at the Game Awards, so.
1821903	1823044	I mean, it would just make sense.
1823044	1824444	Right, the math is mathing.
1824444	1826445	So anyway, stay tuned to our socials.
1826445	1828166	We'll let you know if there's gonna be a live thing.
1828166	1835229	I just have to check my schedule at work and make sure, because these, I swear to God, the awards ceremonies start earlier and earlier every stinking year.
1835669	1842541	Because don't they do like a pre-show at like 4.30 that leads into the actual show at 5 because it's like three hours long.
1842541	1844484	I'm also like I'm not gonna lie.
1844484	1846567	What day of the week is December 7th, a Thursday?
1847259	1849820	It's usually a Thursday is when they do those.
1849820	1850721	It is a Thursday.
1850721	1866249	There's a part of me, y'all, that kind of wants to go like just once, just once, like just do a silly trip, drive to LA at night, go to the Game Awards, drive back the next day, like just do something silly.
1866249	1868030	Like I'm not going to lie.
1868030	1873513	I'm I mean, I know tickets already went on sale, but I don't think we've ever seen that auditorium full.
1873513	1875314	So they're probably still on sale.
1877256	1878457	I'm debating it, y'all.
1878457	1879117	I'm not going to lie.
1879117	1880379	I'm debating it.
1880379	1882120	So we'll see.
1882120	1883041	I'll let you know next week.
1883041	1884783	I'll make a decision next week.
1884783	1886164	All right.
1886164	1891429	Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week, for sure.
1891429	1892891	DarkSakura, as always, we'll start with you.
1895430	1899294	So, I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight.
1899294	1900735	I've been playing a little bit less.
1900735	1906500	I mean, just with... My voice is a lot better, but it's still kind of cutting out on me.
1906500	1913186	I've played a crap ton of Disney Dreamlight Valley offline as well as online.
1913186	1916690	It's actually just become my go-to for when I need to chill.
1918150	1932795	I did another night of Rudra no Hiho, or Legend of the Rudras, or sorry, Treasure of the Rudras, which is the last RPG that Squaresoft produced for the Super Nintendo.
1932795	1940998	It's very good graphically, it does show that this was like the top of what they had learned for 16-bit graphics.
1944518	1952103	I made a character on Baldur's Gate 3, but I don't like how she looks, so I'm going to start over.
1952103	1953844	Because, you know, that's how I do.
1953844	1956725	That's also very Shane of you.
1956725	1957666	He does the same thing.
1957666	1961248	Well, yeah, but I'm older than Shane, so I was doing it first.
1964430	1979061	I have to say though the one thing I don't like it is the same thing I don't like about the first Dragon Age series is that I would rather just have conversations with characters and not have to pick from a list of topics and never hear your character unless they're a party member.
1979061	1983965	So I've never liked that part of it.
1983965	1985747	Excuse me.
1985747	1987008	I've been just
1988217	1989638	Dabbling in a few other things.
1989638	1990659	I've played some pinball.
1990659	1996203	I picked up a couple of games that I don't remember what they're called, but they're on Mac.
1996203	1998485	Yeah, that's been kind of my week.
1998485	2000286	I still haven't been feeling super great.
2000286	2004830	So it's just been playing cozy, relaxing things.
2004830	2006051	All right.
2006051	2006911	Loki, we'll go to you.
2006911	2008473	How was your gaming week?
2008473	2009814	It's been Minecraft.
2009814	2010774	It's always Minecraft.
2010774	2012276	No, this I've
2013496	2024485	Got an episode out yesterday, I think, and I've been working on the big build on Razeworks server, so I've been doing that.
2024485	2028348	It's like a 60,000 block giant statue thing.
2029889	2031350	So that's mostly done.
2031350	2037216	And then I finished up my storage room and the episode for Channel 64.
2037216	2039078	Now I'm going to start this week.
2039078	2045905	Now that I have time off, I'm going to be sitting down to design the first attraction at the theme park that I'm building.
2045905	2048128	So it's designing all the systems for the ride.
2048128	2049809	It's probably going to be a log plume ride.
2050390	2053431	It's using boats and water streams to push the boats around.
2053431	2057933	And then I have to figure out, like, I want to have it where you, like, target shoot stuff.
2057933	2063355	Kind of think of, like, the Buzz Lightyear Eye a little bit, you know, something like that.
2063355	2071639	So it's designing that and the facade for it and the gates, you know, the entrance for the park and stuff.
2072918	2074740	Lots of stuff, lots of design stuff.
2074740	2080666	I'm trying to do that, and I've got about three episodes worth of footage for RazeWorks server.
2080666	2085130	I think that once I'm done with this build, I'm thinking about maybe the server.
2085130	2086031	I haven't decided yet.
2086031	2097542	There's not really anything for me to do anymore with it, and the grind for this build has been pretty taxing, so I don't know if I'm going to necessarily just stick around to just build farms and stuff.
2098479	2099460	But we'll see.
2099460	2105368	I could probably do that on Channel 64 instead and that would be a lot more worthwhile for me.
2105368	2109653	But yeah, that's what I've been working on.
2109653	2109854	Nice.
2111192	2112953	All right, my gaming week.
2112953	2117314	So in all honesty, like a lot of weeks, it's been a lot of Diablo 4.
2117314	2123596	I think because we're going to get an experience buff for Thanksgiving week, we're getting, what do they call it, the Echoes of Lilith or something like that.
2123596	2127497	It's gonna be like a 35% experience and gold buff throughout Thanksgiving week.
2127497	2131158	I will probably finally hit level cap and clear the battle pass this week.
2131158	2133659	So I'll finally feel like I can focus on other games too.
2134179	2161386	but I'm still enjoying Diablo 4 like my freaking my barrage rogue is very very satisfying I love just spraying monsters down with the you know crossbow it's great so yeah I've been enjoying a lot of that still I have been playing other games too though I've been dabbling a little bit in Overwatch too with a friend of mine playing that I do not like that special mode in the game right now the 3v3 that's like kpop themed which is like getting tickets and all that thing I just
2161906	2178073	I can't, well, look, it's not the aesthetic that I don't care for, that's whatever, I just can't stand the roster of heroes that it's limited to because I like to play support, but my two least favorite support characters, Brigitte and Kiriko, and I know people love Brigitte, okay, I don't.
2178073	2179953	I love having her on my team, I don't love playing as her.
2181494	2186220	are like the only ones you can pick from and I just and it's just so chaotic.
2186220	2187381	I didn't love the special mode.
2187381	2188442	That's all.
2188442	2201777	I was like telling my friend like can't we just play regular 5v5 so I can be Batiste or Moira or somebody else besides fucking Kuroko who I don't I don't I don't like healing as her so it's just yeah um
2202907	2213293	Also I joined Jamie on one of her streams briefly for like an hour playing Dead by Daylight so that was cute and fun and unexpected so that was my Dead by Daylight playing for the week.
2213293	2217636	Let me talk though about some like gaming related things I kind of did.
2217636	2221378	So number one is I want to plug somebody else and their streams.
2221938	2222299	TaleOfD20s
2238719	2241702	He asked me if I would do a tabletop RPG.
2257978	2263880	And so they asked me to play a game called Masks, which is basically like teenage superheroes.
2263880	2265580	So we got to like create our superhero.
2265580	2265840	Yes.
2265840	2267520	And I've committed to the whole thing.
2267520	2269741	And I created a character.
2269741	2273362	And if you want to know more about it, you're just going to have to go check it out.
2273362	2280004	So I will post the link to the archive video in our chat if you want to bookmark that and check it out later.
2280004	2283965	I would also just urge you to check out A Tale of D20s here on Twitch.
2283965	2284825	Give them a follow.
2284825	2285445	Show some love.
2286085	2290490	because there's a lot of other campaigns that I'm not in that are going on that are a lot of fun.
2290490	2291211	So yeah, I had fun with it.
2291211	2295375	So I say that because I don't do tabletop a lot.
2295375	2299139	That's the first time I've done a tabletop game in a very long time.
2299139	2306347	So I was a little nervous going into it because I'm like, I'm not worried about any of the people, but I'm worried about it being broadcast live on the internet when I don't know what I'm doing.
2306747	2320815	But the GM did great and created a very welcoming and safe environment and all the other players were super cool and we had a fun time.
2320815	2323617	So I just want to give a shout out to them and thank them for having me.
2323617	2326018	I will be back next week for the conclusion of the story.
2326018	2327699	It was a two episode commitment.
2327699	2329781	So we did this week and we're going to do one next Sunday.
2330621	2345184	Um, outside of that, I want to briefly mention this because in the gaming world, and Loki, you referenced this earlier, it's not directly about a video game, but a lot of people are very curious about this Scott Pilgrim show that just showed up on Netflix.
2345184	2348405	So it is not Scott Pilgrim versus the world.
2348405	2352386	Um, it is actually Scott Pilgrim, uh, what did they
2353346	2354750	What did they actually call this?
2354750	2357195	I can't remember the name all of a sudden.
2357195	2357777	Oh my god.
2357777	2358719	Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.
2358719	2359320	That was the name of it.
2361297	2363018	This is the show that they have.
2363018	2364438	Some people are saying it's an anime.
2364438	2368180	I don't know if it was actually animated overseas or what, but whatever.
2368180	2369020	It's that style.
2369020	2375123	It's very influenced by that because, you know, it originally was a manga.
2375123	2378305	And I don't watch a lot of TV.
2378305	2381086	You all know this, but my friend kind of wanted to watch it.
2381086	2383007	And I was like, all right, let's watch it.
2383007	2386088	And the first episode was kind of doing its thing.
2386088	2387549	We were like, OK, OK.
2387549	2389790	And then at the end of the first episode, we were like,
2390874	2391615	Okay, wait.
2391615	2392555	Okay, we gotta watch more.
2392555	2393516	We gotta watch more.
2393516	2395578	And so we ended up watching five episodes.
2395578	2402524	And honestly, we would have binged the whole thing if it wasn't like, it's like 1230, and if I don't drive home now, I'm gonna fall asleep.
2402524	2406987	And yeah, so we just agreed like, okay, we'll get back together and binge the other three episodes later.
2406987	2408949	But I'm actually finding I'm really enjoying it.
2409469	2412852	I don't want to talk too much about it because it could get spoilery.
2412852	2415755	And I don't want to do that and ruin it for people that haven't seen it.
2415755	2420919	But I will just say I've been pleasantly surprised with some of the creative directions they've been taking with it.
2420919	2423321	And I am I guess this is really polarizing people.
2423321	2425443	Some people do not like it.
2425443	2428846	I think I think it's I think it's fucking fucking clever.
2428846	2430087	I think it's extremely fucking clever.
2431633	2434334	Watch the movie or read the book first.
2457200	2459400	Um, but I thought, I think it's neat.
2459400	2460421	I can't wait to tell.
2460421	2462941	I'm surprised they got all the voices to come back.
2462941	2463761	They're all in it.
2463761	2464821	I mean, yeah, that was really cool.
2464821	2468042	You can tell some of them are older, but that's okay.
2468042	2469482	It was still fun.
2469482	2470742	So.
2470742	2471923	All right.
2471923	2474203	Uh, with that being said, that was it for my gaming week.
2474203	2479304	I just want to give a positive reaction to that because I so rarely actually sit down and watch movies or TV.
2479304	2484825	So I thought you all would be proud of me that I actually watched not just one episode, but five episodes of Scott Pilgrim takes off.
2484825	2484945	So.
2485825	2486866	All right.
2486866	2488067	Um, let's move on.
2488067	2489568	Let's talk about what is going on.
2489568	2491669	And we have kind of a lighter news week this week.
2491669	2497273	Again, this week, you know, we're going into the end of the year, less games coming out.
2497273	2501176	I'm, I am disappointed in myself that I did not play Super Mario RPG.
2501176	2507721	However, my husband just got back from Costco and here's my four, there's no codes on this.
2507721	2508642	They're all in the back.
2508642	2510583	Here's my four $25 Nintendo eShop cards.
2513948	2517590	So I can get another voucher and buy myself Super Mario RPG.
2517590	2519451	So that'll be happening soon.
2519451	2522713	And, and, and.
2522713	2525455	I got a set of PlayStation cards too.
2525455	2531219	For when, for when PlayStation Plus goes on sale, inevitably on Black Friday, or I think it might already be.
2531219	2539744	I'm going to load up on that as well and not, not feel bad about how much I'm paying for it because I at least got a discount from getting a hundred dollars worth of cards for 90 bucks.
2539744	2542406	So that was my Thanksgiving gift to myself.
2543151	2545979	Alright, let's get into gaming news, Loki.
2547287	2557273	So yes, the Embracer Group has basically laid off 900 employees in just this quarter.
2557273	2574222	So, according to the most recent sales report from the Crystal Dynamics and, or from the Embracer Group, they said that the company has experienced a 13% increase in net sales between July and September, so for quarter two of their fiscal year.
2575282	2584345	As part of that though, they said that around 900 people were laid off as part of reduction in headcount.
2584345	2587006	That equates to 5% of their whole workforce.
2587006	2592288	I'm assuming that's because they're purchasing a bunch of companies and redundancy and whatnot.
2592288	2601731	They said they've also reduced the number of projects being worked on and focusing on improving the projected return on investment with PC and console.
2603281	2613644	They said that they would like to put it on the record that special thanks to the people that have left Embracer in the quarter.
2613644	2617104	But that doesn't really say much other than, you know, what they're doing with their employees.
2617104	2617545	I don't know.
2617545	2620525	I don't like how Embracer is kind of buying up all these companies.
2620525	2623326	It feels to me like EA.
2623326	2629027	You know how we had like a lot of great studios and then EA came in and gutted them all.
2629027	2629247	Yeah.
2629247	2630968	So it's like EA 2.0 again.
2632213	2632613	Well, yeah.
2632613	2641715	And then, you know, obviously Embracer Group, I think, was setting up for these much larger aspirations, which, you know, if rumors are to be believed, was some sort of Saudi Arabia deal or something.
2641715	2643355	I don't know.
2643355	2645015	And then that didn't happen.
2645015	2651396	And now it's like now all these companies that they bought are having to pay the price of what was a really bad business decision in many ways.
2651396	2658158	It's just it's so it just sucks to see that the people responsible for that sort of decision.
2658158	2659438	Of course, the CEOs.
2659438	2659658	That's
2662290	2663491	It's, it's gross.
2663491	2672836	And that's the thing that I just, as much as we should be celebrating all the great games that came out this year, it's this type of news that just leaves the most stank in the room.
2672836	2679400	And it's, it's not just Embracer, every fucking week on this show, every fucking week for the last six months.
2680020	2684024	We've had some layoff that's happening and it's it's sad.
2684024	2685105	I mean, it's what?
2685105	2686847	OK, it's 900 here.
2686847	2689270	But how many hundred was it last week?
2689270	2692353	How many how many hundred was it when we were talking about Bungie?
2692353	2693835	How many hundred was it like?
2695434	2714501	We're talking about thousands of people in this industry have lost their job in 2023 and that sucks because usually this industry is very good at taking care of each other and filling in other positions and hiring people where everybody says, how are you going to take care of thousands of people?
2714501	2716862	Well, not every story here is going to have a happy ending.
2716862	2718262	It sucks.
2718262	2719503	The CEOs are fine.
2720866	2723108	Of course, of course, you know, can't punish them.
2723108	2725590	Well, except for one who's leaving on Jan.
2725590	2726470	Well, no, you know what?
2726470	2728752	No, I can't even I can't even say that tongue in cheek.
2728752	2730033	He's getting a golden parachute.
2730033	2730953	Fuck him.
2730953	2734976	Like I can't even I can't even say something sassy about it.
2734976	2737358	That sucks, too.
2737358	2740720	I mean, John Riccitello left, so I guess there's that.
2740720	2742181	That's hardly anything.
2742181	2743102	Yeah, I get one.
2746952	2749736	I am not counting Bobby Kotick gone until he's actually gone.
2758379	2759120	Yeah, there's that.
2759120	2760821	And there's the fact it's a golden parachute.
2760821	2768406	So does the does it even really know for the for intensive wanting to see CEOs bear the brunt of these bad decisions?
2768406	2769146	No, it doesn't.
2769146	2772268	It doesn't actually make me feel better at all what's happening to Bobby Kotick.
2772268	2777131	I mean, yes, I'm glad he will no longer be in the industry, if all goes the way it should go.
2777131	2786558	But I'm it doesn't offset all this, all this other terrible crap from other CEOs and bad decisions and other, you know, high level bad business decisions.
2787378	2802743	that are causing the money to just hemorrhage so bad, they have to decide, Welp, guess we just can't have this studio make this game anymore, or Welp, guess we have to tell this studio that we're putting their game out at the end of the year, whether it's done or not, Kong.
2802743	2803003	Like...
2803450	2810474	or even, like, it's not just calling even, like, was it the recent Walking Dead game was also terrible too.
2810474	2818379	A lot of games that are just not good that are being put out because they're being rushed by these publishers.
2818379	2826283	GameMill, though, is its own thing, because GameMill's always been a shovelware company, so that's not... I'm surprised that people are just picking up on that now.
2826283	2832407	It's like, no, they've been like that for... I mean, when I was selling VO games, like...
2833544	2834405	Fair.
2834405	2840790	Um, SJ in our chat says, I wonder and hope Jeff will open the show referencing these layoffs.
2840790	2848296	He of course won't attack these companies, but I hope he dedicates these awards to those folks who sacrifice their time on these games only to get laid off.
2848296	2857543	I would like to see that too, but knowing that there is such a huge financial contribution that does end up coming from these same companies, unfortunately, not bloody likely.
2858584	2862787	But maybe there is a way he could wordsmith it.
2862787	2870973	I like your idea of dedicating the awards to the folks that made them, whether they're still in the industry or not.
2870973	2875556	I think there is a very clever way you could word that and get away with it.
2875556	2879418	I think we will be lucky if we get a tweet, unfortunately.
2879418	2884942	I think from Jeff Keighley, I think you'll be lucky if you get a tweet on that.
2884942	2886143	Sorry.
2886143	2887244	But I would like to see that too.
2887244	2887664	Don't get me wrong.
2897359	2914751	Questbuster in chat says Embracer was so aggressive in expanding over the last three years, borrowing, leveraging, and spending billions to rapidly build an empire, almost without regard for potential bumps in the road ahead from the high-profile failure of titles like Saints Row to the Saudi deal collapse.
2914751	2916453	And who's going to pay for that?
2918424	2920726	I guess we have, can I get on my soapbox for a minute?
2920726	2922227	Can I rant about the person I ranted to?
2922227	2923028	Soapbox away.
2923028	2923528	Okay.
2923528	2927011	Can I rant about the person I ran a lot about on this show?
2927011	2928692	Motherfucking Elon Musk.
2928692	2929393	My God.
2929393	2930534	How?
2930534	2931895	Motherfucker.
2931895	2937560	And there's so many things I could say about him.
2937560	2938520	Don't get me started.
2938520	2939381	I know, I know.
2939381	2942244	But can we just for a minute look at the fact
2943154	2953237	He paid $44 billion for a company that is very clearly, by his own hand, way less than half that value now.
2953237	2958119	If even that, I can't even believe that company's worth $1 billion at this point, to be quite honest.
2958119	2969323	And I would love to see an external audit tell us what that company's really fucking worth, because I would bet it's worth pennies on the dollar for what he paid for it, by his own hand.
2970247	2971208	Period.
2971208	2974370	And you like this is especially with him.
2974370	2980155	This is a situation where you can say this wasn't the temperature in the room.
2980155	2983418	This wasn't the industry moving in the other direction.
2983418	2992585	This was literally your stupid fucking ass and your big fucking mouth that doesn't know how to shut.
2992585	2995508	And I boldly underline this the fuck up.
2997276	3004281	Elon Musk has no one to blame for what has happened over on Shitter except for himself.
3004281	3006363	No one.
3006363	3018632	Who's gonna pay for that money that he literally flushed down the fucking toilet that he brought through the front door the day he started at Twitter?
3018632	3019533	Who's gonna pay for that?
3020851	3030937	because people like that motherfucker never do it, never pay a dime out of his own pocket, never have to feel any burn or anything for anything.
3030937	3038262	Speaking of burn, while he's flushing Twitter down the shithole, he blew up a fucking rocket this weekend.
3038262	3040043	Thank God no people were on it.
3041038	3043780	This guy is a fucking moron.
3043780	3045102	Period.
3045102	3046963	I can't stand him.
3046963	3058374	And I can't stand the fact that he's not being held accountable for literally actively making the world a worse place.
3060728	3061969	I hate him!
3061969	3067653	Don't get me started on his anti-semitism.
3067653	3071877	When I talk about the by his own hand, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
3072847	3079871	TigerClaw says this is the guy who wants to send people to Mars, and he also wants to implant chips in people's brain.
3079871	3084573	And if you agree to do this stuff, I'm sorry, not sorry.
3084573	3092618	You deserve the big misfortune that's coming your way if you are dumb enough to buy what this guy is selling at this point.
3093948	3095689	I agree with SSJ100 Matt.
3095689	3096890	Send people to Mars.
3096890	3098191	You first, sir.
3098191	3099952	Absolutely.
3099952	3106775	If this is something we need so badly, by all means, Elon, after you.
3106775	3113059	Get off my planet, because you're not making this one a better place.
3113059	3114580	I feel better.
3114580	3115200	Do you feel better?
3115200	3117562	Because I feel better.
3117562	3119363	All right.
3119363	3121444	Anyway, what should we talk about next?
3121444	3122765	Oh, let's talk about
3124005	3125026	PlayStation Portal.
3125026	3127147	Yes, it's a video game podcast, isn't it?
3127147	3130750	Let's talk about the PlayStation Portal.
3130750	3136694	The PlayStation Portal was a new peripheral that just came out this Wednesday.
3136694	3140276	And people were kind of saying, why couldn't you have just made a new Vita, yo?
3140276	3143498	Like this device is meant for remote streaming.
3143498	3146080	But people are interested in this.
3146080	3149062	And who bought this new device that just came out on Wednesday?
3149562	3154684	Scalpers, scalpers, scalpers, scalpers, because the world sucks.
3154684	3158986	And scalpers have been getting their hands on the player.
3158986	3167489	And this portal will cost, I'm getting this from the outlet Eurogamer, who says that the price over there is 199 euros.
3167489	3174392	But eBay, of course, is putting listings over 300 euros, because again, scalpers.
3174392	3176093	It's just a shitty, I should,
3177216	3181718	People turn to scalping sometimes.
3181718	3184800	Here's the thing.
3184800	3195865	The people that turn to scalping are the people that are getting laid off because Elon Musk is a twat and all these other people that are in the industry that are making bad decisions.
3195865	3201488	These people turn to scalping because they feel they have no other choice to make money and put food in people's mouths.
3201488	3203328	So I'm very careful how much I do.
3203328	3204749	I don't like scalpers.
3204749	3205870	I don't like this whole thing.
3206752	3217008	But I also kind of recognize the real problem is the people who create the demand for it, who ultimately in turn end up being the rich motherfuckers that have this type of dispensable income to be able to pay for it.
3217008	3221816	So the people that buy this stuff are the real problem.
3223198	3228101	And, and if you've ever bought a Scout product, I'm sorry, yes, I'm talking about you.
3228101	3232944	And I hope you'll make a better decision next time and think about some of these things that I'm saying.
3232944	3237507	Anyway, um, there's a ton of people that are on eBay selling this.
3237507	3240749	I again, I'm not sure I didn't think the demand would be there for this.
3240749	3244792	But yeah, I'm surprised that they're not just stuck with this stuff.
3244892	3250319	The reviews for this are mixed, saying that the hardware is pretty good, but what, what, basically what's the point?
3250319	3252041	It's a very limited type of appeal.
3252041	3254404	It's not an actual PlayStation handheld.
3254404	3260252	It's just another screen for your PS5 on hopefully strong internet.
3261035	3275419	But anyway, if you can fucking hold off just a little bit longer, the PlayStation Direct store, at least in the UK, and I'm pretty sure it's a similar situation in the US, is saying, we're working hard to make more stock available.
3275419	3278460	Please check back on Wednesday, 22nd of November.
3278840	3282062	The US version of the page is saying early December.
3282062	3286024	So there does appear to still be chances to get this before Christmas.
3286024	3302274	So if anything else, I will try to say for those folks that are tempted for whatever reason to support scalping and buy one of these, I applaud Sony for at least going as far to say, if you can wait a little longer, you could probably still get one before Christmas.
3302274	3304736	So I do like that they're
3306024	3310368	trying to, you know, get people to not give in to the scalpers.
3310368	3312230	And I hope, I hope it does work out.
3312230	3318355	So anyway, I have no interest in the PlayStation Portal at all.
3318355	3322619	And I'm disappointed they give it zero functionality outside of what it does with the PS5.
3322619	3326423	Like, why couldn't it at least be a fucking Vita on top?
3326423	3326543	Why?
3329295	3354344	It's just gonna be e-waste here very soon because it's only gonna function for the PlayStation 5 and it doesn't work great all the time in the preferred environment which is like I guess on your own Wi-Fi like if you're planning on taking this remotely like to a hotel or somewhere and play your PlayStation 5 games good luck with that because it's not gonna be a good experience.
3355006	3360572	Unless you're playing a point and click adventure or something that can move slowly with delay like that, you know?
3360572	3361453	What's the point then?
3361453	3367339	Like, I don't know, like, how many point and click adventure games does PlayStation 5 have?
3367339	3369161	No, I know.
3369161	3370843	You think of action and things like that.
3370843	3373286	So yeah.
3373286	3374928	Anyhow, um, let's move on.
3374928	3375929	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3378229	3388153	So, um, there's a little thing that happened with, uh, the skins in Fortnite that has people feeling a little bit less than happy.
3388153	3397957	So, without really any announcement about it, uh, people found that there were skins that they had paid for that they can no longer use in-game.
3397957	3402579	And specifically what it is, is that there are items that were
3404060	3406121	rated 12+.
3406121	3416307	So according to Epic, about 7% of the Fortnite skins can only be equipped in islands that are rated as teen level islands.
3416307	3424751	There are some people who most of the skins they have are those restricted items.
3424751	3431415	Although funny enough, one person posted a screenshot showing that all of the skins except Michael Myers
3432830	3439453	were age restricted only because Mikey doesn't have his knife.
3439453	3440674	Oh.
3440674	3442415	Like what?
3442415	3449439	This is like the most violent character out there.
3449439	3461285	So there is some thought that Epic's going to go in and do versions that are teen safe by their standards that you can then use, but there's no confirmation about it.
3463431	3473661	I mean, Epic says that it's working on something like that, but the confirmation isn't necessarily that it's happened, or that they have any kind of time frame on that.
3473661	3480747	So, I mean, it's a game where you hunt people.
3480747	3484451	It's supposed to be a teen plus game.
3485612	3490034	So, I mean... I thought Fortnite was rated teen.
3490034	3492216	It is rated teen according to their website.
3492216	3495877	Why would any of the skins not... Like, that doesn't make any sense.
3495877	3501761	I mean, maybe they're trying to change it to where they can make it kid-friendly.
3501761	3502681	Why?
3502681	3504142	You can't do that at this point.
3504142	3505022	This is ridiculous.
3505022	3506363	You can't re-rate it.
3506363	3507624	It won't work like that.
3507624	3508244	I mean, maybe, I don't know.
3508244	3513827	And then they're announcing this business... They're announcing that they did it after they did the thing.
3515507	3521293	So, I don't understand the logic.
3521293	3530681	It has to be some business suit person that made the decision, because we all know what happens when you get into high upper management, I guess.
3532711	3538212	You know what I mean?
3538212	3555057	There's like a point where you get away from quote the people in the trenches and lose that connection to what's actually going on or people who don't really even understand the game itself who are trying to make decisions about it.
3555217	3555977	It's that.
3555977	3561179	It's the line where the gamers stop and the businessmen begin.
3561179	3562519	That's what it is.
3562519	3563839	Business people.
3563839	3565520	Yes.
3565520	3566120	Yes.
3566120	3570861	Business humans.
3570861	3573802	But at any rate, it's ridiculous.
3573802	3575423	I mean, I'm kind of glad I don't play Fortnite.
3577952	3580833	Anytime I've ever played, it's only as Ariana Grande anyway.
3580833	3583294	So who I imagine is E for everyone.
3583294	3585175	So whatever.
3585175	3603041	And I'm pretty sure, though, that they got the whole deal of Myers winning around with his keyboard, you know, pretending to be John Carpenter was taken directly from the Samination parodies of Dead by Daylight, where John Carpenter follows him around playing his theme.
3604690	3605671	Interesting.
3605671	3614719	I did not realize he didn't have his knife in that game, which is so funny to me because he should have his knife because you run around collecting fucking guns in the manga.
3614719	3618802	But I do realize there is a creative mode in the game, too.
3618802	3620744	And I feel like this is where this is all.
3620744	3622946	Actually, it's not like Battle Royale or whatever.
3622946	3624167	It is happening in creative.
3624167	3626048	Yeah, it's that it's the creative.
3626048	3627149	Yeah, I get it.
3627149	3628751	It's in the the
3630002	3632965	Fortnite, Roblox section of the game.
3659690	3662011	Let's do that.
3662011	3671596	So apparently there's, you know, the whole Epic versus Google thing is actually now in court, their legal showdown.
3671596	3676459	And we're getting updates around this that sound kind of crazy.
3676459	3686084	So first off, it's been noted that Google hasn't really been keeping all the evidence that they are supposed to be retaining all the documents.
3686084	3686504	That says,
3687907	3694930	Epic was allowed to tell the jury that Google may have destroyed or hidden relevant evidence.
3694930	3714500	Epic's lawyers, they brought up how few Google chat logs have been provided during discovery and even said that Google execs had possibly deleted chats and jokes about hiding conversations.
3717248	3733474	Also saying that there was a Google Information Governance lead, Gennaro Lopez, who was questioned multiple times about seemingly missing chat logs and the company's policy of telling employees to chat off the record about sensitive issues.
3733474	3738296	No, that doesn't sound legally dubious or anything.
3738296	3738916	Of course not.
3741538	3743759	and also said, you know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3743759	3753728	SSJ has like the comment of the night here in chat saying Google had their documents, but they canceled it after a few years of support.
3753728	3754348	Fair enough.
3754348	3754889	Yeah.
3754889	3755149	Sorry.
3755149	3757611	We stored all of our documents on.
3757611	3763636	Was it on one plus or Google plus G plus or Google Google Wave?
3763636	3764917	They were all Google Wave documents.
3764917	3765278	Yeah.
3765278	3765758	Oh, no.
3765758	3766839	Yeah.
3768787	3775651	And yeah, it says you cannot guarantee the documents that were destroyed will contradict the testimony we're going to hear.
3775651	3784777	And it says also during this case, you had the default setting to delete chats every 24 hours, correct?
3784777	3790601	When they were questioning the vice president of apps and games.
3792904	3799126	Also, yeah, and then going back to that Google CEO wasn't saving evidence as well.
3799126	3805048	Back to that whole auto delete thing as well.
3805048	3807289	So, yeah, it's drama.
3807289	3812970	And it'd be interesting to see how that plays out, if that hurts Google in any way about this.
3812970	3814691	Yeah.
3814691	3814951	Huh.
3816769	3817110	Naughty Dog
3833633	3842983	Naughty Dog is the studio that's brought us a lot of great hits, including The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.
3842983	3850330	And it was announced that a remastered version of The Last of Us Part II is coming to the PlayStation 5 this January.
3851431	3866512	Unfortunately it was a leaked trailer that showed up that had to be confirmed by Sony so who knows if maybe they were trying to save this for a certain first week in December award show that was scheduled to show some trailers, but they had to confirm ahead of that.
3867052	3870015	January 19, 2024, with improved loading times, PS5, 4K graphics, and integration with the PS5's new DualSense controller.
3883826	3888190	Yes, so all those things are going to be things that are in the game.
3888190	3897538	Also new in the game, No Return, a brand new roguelike mode, which allows you to choose your path through a series of randomized encounters.
3897538	3902783	And you can play as unlockable characters that have not been seen before in the franchise.
3902783	3906946	Are we talking like Crash Bandicoot?
3906946	3909569	That would be so jarring, and I would love that.
3910467	3911408	Me too.
3911408	3915349	Like, if you're going to go outside the franchise, make it funny.
3915349	3920471	Well, if it's Naughty Dog, then that would have to be, what was it, Ratchet and Clank or something like that?
3920471	3922152	No, it'd be fucking Nathan Drake or something.
3922152	3923993	Like, it's not- Ow, boo.
3923993	3925294	Come on.
3925294	3925794	I don't know.
3925794	3929195	Other Last of Us characters that you can't- Well, I guess they say outside the franchise.
3929195	3929475	I don't know.
3931136	3934158	You'll be able to compete in a global leaderboard.
3934158	3944903	Also, the remastered version brings early versions of three levels that were not in the original game, and commentary, which I forget is a thing a lot of games do these days.
3944903	3956528	Director Neil Druckmann, narrative lead Hallie Gross, and actors Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, and Laura Bailey will provide commentary throughout the game.
3956528	3958069	I think also the most
3958809	3968031	Pleasant surprise about this is that if you own the game on a prior platform, you can upgrade for $10.
3968031	3975052	I thought that was like, oh, I thought this was going to be an excuse to charge $70 for the same game, which we know other studios do.
3975052	3980693	But no, yeah, you'll be able to buy an upgrade version for just $10.
3980693	3981833	They have to at this point.
3981833	3985574	Like, it makes sense, because like, if you think about it, they just released The Last of Us 2.
3985574	3987914	Like, what are you possibly like updating?
3987914	3988094	Yeah.
3988334	3988914	DarkSouls3 Elden Ring
4003194	4004295	You just released this.
4004295	4004915	What the hell?
4004915	4008558	There is a very important asterisk with that.
4008558	4012802	So I want to make sure this is clear from the official PlayStation blog.
4012802	4017325	And good news for existing owners of The Last of Us Part 2 on PlayStation 4.
4017325	4023170	You will be able to upgrade to a digital version of The Last of Us Part 2 for just $10 at launch.
4023170	4027133	You'll also be able to import your saves in the original game to the Part 2 remastered.
4027133	4027553	Oh, I'm sorry.
4027553	4030336	When I first read that, I thought they were saying you had to have a digital version
4030916	4030996	I'm
4053118	4056240	E3VL asks a good question in chat going why not call it DLC instead of remaster?
4083518	4101070	More people are getting exposed to The Last of Us thanks to the HBO series, and specifically, it will be part two when that next season inevitably shows up, which they haven't even started filming yet, because there's been a lot of chat about who's going to play Abby, but they haven't officially announced that yet.
4101070	4109536	But I think because the hype is going to be building around season two, there are going to be people that want to, now that the actor strike is resolved, they can have those conversations.
4110717	4121607	I think there's going to be a lot of people that want to play the second game who maybe got exposed to The Last of Us through the series and maybe are now revisiting it now.
4121607	4124289	Mike Deaf says, I thought they did announce who would play Abby.
4124289	4135599	There are strong rumors and there are articles going around about who is being talked to, but they have not confirmed Abby's role as of yet.
4135599	4135740	So.
4136448	4144798	But apparently it is somebody who originally auditioned for L in the game, so... Interesting.
4144798	4147902	Alright, let's move on.
4147902	4151926	Next story.
4151926	4152888	Which is from DarkSakura.
4154978	4171127	So there is a big accusation against SEGA about threatening to lay off a good portion of the unionized workforce as a retaliatory action.
4172464	4181326	So, basically, on November 6th, SEGA put out a proposal to, quote, phase out all temporary workers by February 2024.
4181326	4194050	A lot of people who were in QA and localization, and they sent this to the Allied Employees Guild Improving SEGA, or AEGIS.
4195651	4204263	The union represents over 200 employees across marketing, sales, product development, and other departments.
4204263	4209651	The layoffs would impact about 40% of the group or about 80 unionized employees total.
4211953	4234725	And instead of bargaining with the union, Sega just delivered the news directly to employees in a meeting, and also violated rules against negotiating directly with those employees instead of with their union.
4238769	4244650	SEGA, of course, hasn't replied to any requests for comment.
4244650	4251952	As stated by Elise Willeker, who's a senior QA tester, I'm going to read the quote.
4251952	4262414	It's disheartening to see such actions from SEGA, as it is unmistakably demonstrates bad faith bargaining and refusal to recognize the valuable contributions of a significant portion of our colleagues.
4263294	4274958	We have filed an unfair labor practice charge to call out SEGA's direct dealing with members and its breaching of the status quo by telling bargaining unit members that our jobs would be ending shortly.
4274958	4284841	So, of course, it's gone to the National Labor Relations Board for review, but it may not be resolved in time to prevent the layoffs.
4284841	4285481	But
4289061	4291302	I hope that they nail them for this.
4291302	4296045	It really makes me very disappointed in SEGA.
4296045	4309391	It really makes me not want to buy any of their products until they, you know, recognize the authority of the union.
4311192	4314214	Yeah, and the wave of the unionizing is coming.
4314214	4322320	I'm not surprised to see a game company allegedly pushing back, you know, in the same type of in this strong type of way, but they're not going to win.
4322320	4324061	They're not going to win the war.
4324061	4329385	They might see this as a winning the battle, especially if, you know, they can't reverse this by the time people actually get laid off.
4329385	4331046	But they're not going to win the war.
4331046	4337891	And so I think companies need to figure out how to welcome this culture because it's not going away.
4339972	4346017	And yeah, like DarkSakura is expressing with her feelings, it's just going to put more people off.
4346017	4348079	That's not a good thing.
4348079	4349740	Yeah.
4349740	4350621	All right.
4350621	4351842	Well, speaking of SEGA.
4353157	4363627	Yeah, so there was all those rumors that, you know, a member of Microsoft and I think even other companies were looking to purchase SEGA, but didn't end up going through with that, obviously.
4363627	4376000	So that's finally, we finally got a comment from SEGA regarding it, from the CEO saying that they are honored that so many companies were interested in purchasing SEGA, but SEGA is not for sale.
4376460	4378322	Many companies are interested.
4378322	4379342	We feel honored.
4379342	4382184	We have attractive IPs and potentials.
4382184	4383866	Companies owned by the owner.
4383866	4385927	A strong owner.
4385927	4391331	I don't think that kind of transaction is going to happen, according to Yatsumi.
4394208	4413384	And of course, you know, they talked about growing, that they're pursuing different categories, like, of course, Roblox, because they have the Sonic speed simulator there and their movies, which have been wildly successful, thanks to, you know, some redesigns of the main character.
4413384	4421291	And actually, they have their TV series coming, too, because Knuckles has this TV series pretty soon.
4421291	4422572	Yeah, I mean, it's
4423592	4431558	It's going to be interesting to see where they go, but they're not going to be owned by Microsoft anytime soon.
4431558	4432658	Or anyone, for that matter.
4432658	4434219	They're going to... Yeah, or anyone.
4434219	4442265	And probably after that last story, nobody wants to touch them right now anyway, so... Well, yeah, makes them less attractive, for sure.
4442265	4444687	That's true.
4444687	4450471	Also, lastly, here, before we get to some of our regular segments, you know, and talking about things that are not so attractive,
4451391	4457055	We're going to talk about AI-generated content and how it is starting to spread more and more on YouTube.
4457055	4465741	YouTube has now made a requirement per a blog post made by Product Management Vice President Jennifer Flannery O'Connor and Emily Moxley.
4465741	4466802	They are both vice presidents.
4467662	4481626	They talked about this in a blog post on November 14th, stating that any video that contains AI-generated content requires disclosure and content labels in the video description that make it clear that aspects of the video were generated by AI.
4481626	4484907	So basically, events that never happened.
4484907	4489008	Deepfakes showing an individual that's doing something they didn't actually do.
4489008	4493589	So that's good, but the question is, how are they going to enforce this?
4494554	4495854	How are they going to enforce this?
4514079	4518903	air on the side of, you know, like where anybody could say, oh, this is made by AI.
4518903	4524787	And now the thing gets shut down because somebody reported it, even if it was legit and not the result of AI.
4524787	4526568	So we don't know.
4526568	4534474	But YouTube is rolling out community guidelines that allow if you are affected by AI generated content, you can request that a video is removed.
4534474	4542079	So like if somebody were to make a video of me saying something hideous that I never said, I could make that request to YouTube, take it down.
4543880	4557888	YouTube is also doing this for like musicians whose voices is being mimicked by AI software, which I think is very interesting because that's a very big trend on YouTube right now is these softwares of creators.
4557888	4558048	Yeah.
4558048	4558589	And that whole thing.
4558589	4559629	What?
4559629	4562771	I was going to say, are you going to what about the other part of that?
4562771	4564152	Have you heard about that one?
4564152	4565493	What?
4565493	4565693	So.
4566443	4569865	They are allowing them to crack down on it.
4569865	4575207	However, there's also a part of Google's AI thing.
4575207	4579870	Certain artists have signed up to allow their voice to be used for different things.
4579870	4587714	So you could, you could prompt it to generate like something for you and use that in your YouTube shorts.
4587714	4588294	Oh, interesting.
4588294	4591736	Well, then they also say that parody is still fair game.
4592932	4597333	And that's an interesting gray area too is what is what is parody?
4597333	4609437	So we're here you ruined it that that like that channel I love their their stuff where they take they do AI voices and ruin songs like they'll have like Johnny Cash sing like
4610410	4611352	YouTube channel.
4626112	4631415	And that, honestly, I think that something like that would be a violation of his estate.
4631415	4650286	I still think it would if they're taking his actual vocal samples, running it through AI, you know, to have it generate words that he would have never touched in his voice, to me is a violation of
4652455	4653696	I don't think it would be parody.
4653696	4661882	I think a parody would be if there was a true singer who sounded like him, you know, doing it.
4661882	4663403	That's a parody.
4663403	4665684	Taking his vocal samples is theft.
4667182	4673106	Well, and obviously relating this back to video games, because you might wonder why, what does this have to do with video games?
4673106	4677009	So we've been focusing a lot on this story of musicians because that's where the blog post was going.
4677009	4691779	But a lot of people that are, that are really getting angry at this are voice actors and the voice actors from video games, because, and this is, you know, to some of the voice actors I follow on Twitter, this is, this is a real bad issue right now is that there's these people making these YouTubes of
4692219	4695384	people doing character voices by AI.
4695384	4698689	And again, it's things that these characters would never say.
4698689	4699290	So it's...
4701494	4704756	It's it's something's got to give.
4704756	4712640	And I absolutely think these voice actors have every right to sue on these grounds when this is this is being stolen, essentially.
4712640	4719164	But how do you how do you make that happen without flooding the courts with issues and so forth?
4719164	4719864	I don't know.
4719864	4723666	There there really doesn't seem to be an easy issue about this for sure.
4723666	4724747	So.
4724747	4726508	Hmm.
4726508	4728349	Anyway, we need to try.
4728349	4729049	I want to go ahead.
4730311	4738255	I really want to point out what Mike Deft said about not confusing text-to-speech with AI.
4738255	4747779	Because with text-to-speech, first of all, I'm sure anyone who's been on my channel in the last couple weeks has heard Samantha.
4747779	4751001	That is a paid actor.
4751781	4758788	providing voice samples for the specific use of making things red.
4758788	4763752	Like being able to convert that to text and it never sounds great.
4763752	4771119	Siri sounds great, but like a lot of those just don't sound very good because they're having to do them on the fly.
4771119	4772120	That is not
4773241	4783691	AI that is simply voice synthesizing with paid for recorded voice samples.
4783691	4784391	All right.
4784391	4794080	Well, in our next segment, we need to take a trip down memory lane to a time when AI just meant the computer you were playing against in a segment we call the classic game of the week.
4794080	4794641	Here's the bumper.
4805259	4813023	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4813023	4816905	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4816905	4818866	And what did you pick for us this week, DarkSakura?
4820488	4826471	It is a fighting game that came out for the PlayStation.
4826471	4831794	It was developed by Dream Factory and published by Square in 1996.
4831794	4839078	It was Dream Factory's very first release and Square's first release on a CD-based console.
4840078	4842241	So, there you go.
4842241	4849188	Basically, also, one of the big, I think, selling points about this game?
4849188	4857918	Well, first of all, the characters were designed by Toriyama, who did the Dragon Ball series and Chrono Trigger.
4857918	4860140	And it did have a sequel named Tobal 2.
4861658	4869923	that didn't come out outside of the Asian market.
4869923	4886212	So the North American and Japanese version of the game was packaged with a playable demo of Final Fantasy VII and had previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and Saga Frontier.
4886832	4894544	So, I mean, this is kind of a big deal, and honestly, I think 90... Most of the people I knew got the game for the Final Fantasy VII demo.
4894544	4894864	Guilty.
4894864	4896206	I'm gonna be honest.
4896206	4896347	Yeah.
4898021	4902942	But then when you go back in and play, the game is actually a fairly decent game.
4902942	4913625	To ball number one, it was a tournament mode where two player versus a practice mode and a quest mode that used their fighting game engine.
4913625	4921207	It ran at 60 frames a second because the polygons of the game were not textured.
4921207	4926088	And with reducing the details, it gave it a very distinctive look compared to other fighting games at the time.
4928197	4934598	The controls were full freedom of movement in the ring as long as you face the opponent.
4934598	4937619	And I want to know who's texting me.
4937619	4939039	Okay.
4939039	4941040	Sorry, anyway.
4941040	4946361	You also have a grappling and blocking system.
4946361	4952742	So you had counter moves with it, you had a dash and jump, and you had like high, medium, low attacks.
4952742	4956103	There's the quest mode as well, which lets you explore a dungeon.
4957523	4967707	You have to go down a number of floors, you have traps, you have fights waiting for you, with some of the enemies being the playable characters.
4967707	4974629	You find items as you go, kind of like a rudimentary adventure RPG mode.
4974629	4976090	But you can't save the progress.
4976090	4978490	If you die, you start over.
4978490	4982352	But if you defeat certain characters in this mode, you unlock them as playable characters.
4984309	4995895	So the story of the game is that it takes place in 2048 on a planet called Tobol, which has these deposits of an energy ores called Molmoron.
4995895	5001078	And so the tournament is to see who has the rights to mine the ore.
5001078	5002559	So that's it.
5002559	5006041	I mean, a little bit unique as far as reasons for fighting games, but meh.
5007371	5009132	So, Tobal No.
5009132	5029046	1, the music was composed by eight of Square's composers, including Mitsuda Yasunori, Kawakami Yasuhiro, Sasai Ryuji, Hamazu Masashi, Nakano Jr., Ito Kenji, Matsueda Noriko, and Shimomura Yoko.
5029046	5029987	We know her, we love her.
5030902	5043505	It had different music themes in electronica, rock, some instrumentals, even some kind of hip-hop and ambience, and even some jazz themes in there.
5043505	5048686	So the album was released as Tobal No.
5048686	5054788	1 Remixes Electrical Indian, is what it was called.
5054788	5056188	But anyway, I mean,
5058355	5059196	The whole big thing.
5059196	5065742	This was the 8th best-selling video game of 1998 in Japan.
5065742	5072308	And pretty much that has been attributed to the inclusion of the Final Fantasy VII demo disc.
5072308	5078633	And it actually, even though it didn't sell as well in the US, it did kind of become a cult hit over here.
5078633	5079894	It sold 99,183 copies in the US.
5084699	5087003	In Japan it sold 752,000 copies in 1996.
5090789	5093931	The game got very positive reviews.
5093931	5099114	It was innovative, had a different graphic approach.
5099114	5102515	The controls left a little bit to be desired.
5102515	5114482	It was compared to Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter for the controls, with the previous games being considered much more sophisticated in their control.
5116183	5126115	But they also said that having a game that ran at 60 frames per second in a 640x480 resolution for its time was a pretty good thing.
5126115	5133624	Some people found the blocking system to be confused, but the quest system was very, very new for its time.
5135326	5139049	So there were other releases later on.
5139049	5140830	The sequel Tobal No.
5140830	5145154	2 was released in 1997 for PlayStation in Japan only.
5145154	5145834	I've played it.
5145834	5148216	It was pretty okay.
5148216	5154301	And then there was the mobile phone version called Tobal M released in Japan on December 12, 2007.
5154301	5154601	And of course,
5159289	5166713	What phones did we have in 2007 that would have been capable of running something like that in the US?
5166713	5173477	That old Sprint flip phone I had would not have run this.
5173477	5182623	The original iPhone release was 2006, if I remember right, yeah.
5184591	5188093	Well, no, that was 2007.
5188093	5195857	The iPhone at the time could have run it, but we didn't have the app store until a little bit after the first release.
5195857	5202121	So it would have had to have been completely reprogrammed.
5202121	5204402	So anyway, that's it.
5204402	5207084	That's the game, Toeball No.
5207084	5207344	1.
5207344	5210466	There it is, your classic game of the week, Toeball No.
5210466	5213828	1, better known as the game that had the demo for Final Fantasy VII.
5215031	5225077	See, and I always thought that was Toeball number two to have the demo for Final Fantasy VII, but I think I'm... There was another game that had a sequel, too, that I might be confusing with.
5225077	5227818	I don't know, but I definitely got that for the demo.
5227818	5237864	There was one that had... Actually, Final Fantasy VII came with the demo for Brave Fencer Musashi.
5237864	5239025	Ah, yes, I did have that.
5240885	5242687	Tobal No.
5242687	5252297	2 did not come out with any kind of demo disc according to this, although it got better ratings by Famitsu.
5252297	5254419	I think I did get it anyways.
5254419	5256241	I am pretty sure I had Tobal No.
5256241	5258503	2.
5258503	5259104	I remember that.
5259104	5261406	Yeah, we've got Tobal No.
5261406	5261526	2.
5261526	5263008	I mean, we imported it at the time.
5265990	5268192	I believe that you're Zen Monkey.
5268192	5270714	The kangaroo was in Tekken, the Tekken series.
5270714	5274577	I don't remember there was a kangaroo in the Topal games.
5274577	5280341	Oh, I know that you could fight a Chocobo in Topal number two.
5280341	5283463	Oh, that's awesome.
5283463	5284084	Yeah.
5284084	5285885	Work.
5285885	5286846	All right.
5286846	5293090	Well, let's check out a few other headlines here real quick in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
5293090	5293711	We'll start with Loki.
5294673	5302395	Yep, so apparently it's the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, and they've released an update to go along with that.
5302395	5313078	So Half-Life has gotten the 25th anniversary update, which adds some new multiplayer maps as well as some technical improvements as well.
5313078	5322920	So you have three new multiplayer maps, Double Cross, Rust Mill, Zen DM, and two multiplayer models, Skeleton and Too Much Coffee Man.
5324000	5325840	I love too much coffee, man.
5325840	5327121	That's awesome.
5327121	5334162	Also, it was free, and I think it still is free for a specific period of time.
5334162	5339904	I don't remember when that's... But I think it's free for now, because my kids were telling me about that, too.
5339904	5341824	They were like, oh, hey, did you know Half-Life is free?
5341824	5343885	I'm like, I'm pretty sure I already own that.
5346451	5354795	And then of course, along with that, they've also released a 25th anniversary Half-Life documentary from Valve.
5354795	5358077	And you can probably check that out, I'm guessing, for free as well.
5360782	5374330	The 25th anniversary update includes Half-Life Uplink, which was originally released as a CD exclusive for magazines and hardware manufacturers.
5374330	5377292	So that's a piece of something you can do.
5377292	5379153	It's a mini-campaign.
5379153	5386298	And they also did the four new multiplayer maps, including Contamination Pool Party, Disposal, and Rocket Frenzy.
5388356	5391638	Cool, I will have to check that out.
5391638	5391958	All right.
5391958	5395980	You know, 25 years of Half-Life 3, the perfect time to announce Half-Life 3.
5395980	5402584	Just saying, Valve, you know, like... That was literally the only reason why I checked the announcement.
5402584	5409007	I mean, they could be just waiting for, you know, a certain game awards type show to announce something that epic.
5409007	5409848	Don't set the bar.
5409848	5411368	Don't set the bar at that.
5411368	5413009	You'll just leave disappointed.
5413009	5416511	Don't don't do that to yourself.
5416511	5417772	All right, DarkSakura, what do you have?
5419457	5423780	Well, I also have a correction to make.
5423780	5427142	So Final Fantasy VII didn't have a demo disc with it.
5427142	5432506	It was with Musashi, the demo for Final Fantasy VIII came with that.
5432506	5433727	Ah, yes.
5433727	5435068	Yeah.
5435068	5437089	OK, I knew there was a correlation, though.
5437089	5440912	So I definitely got a double one for the Final Fantasy VII demo because I remember playing that.
5443890	5455124	At any rate, the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog for November 2023 has been announced.
5455124	5460290	We have alternate Jake Hunter Daedalus The Awakening of Golden Jazz.
5462038	5486229	Dead Island Riptide Definitive Edition, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen, Ayudin Chronicles Rising, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Maxi Boost On, Nobunaga's Ambition Taishi, River City Melee Mach, Superliminal, Teardown, and then Grandia,
5487464	5498194	is apparently, uh... I think that it's a Grandia, uh... No, it's the original Grandia, nevermind, because I know that they're doing a Grandia remaster.
5498194	5507162	And I take very big exception with this, saying that it was a classic PlayStation RPG, when this shit came out on the Sega Saturn first, get it right.
5509229	5522581	JetMoto, also coming out from PlayStation Stuff for PS2, Parappa the Rapper 2, PSP Up, and for PS4, Klonoa Fantasy Reverie Series.
5522581	5524663	I love freakin' Klonoa.
5524663	5526105	Game made me cry.
5526105	5526665	Ugly cry!
5526665	5528407	Alright, that's it.
5530758	5533920	All right, and what do I have for us?
5533920	5535741	Oh, you brought up Dragon's Dogma 2.
5535741	5547648	Well, there's going to be a whole showcase coming up on that on November 28th that will show 15 whole minutes of new information and gameplay reveals.
5547648	5557054	That'll be at 1 o'clock Pacific, 4 o'clock Eastern on YouTube, directly from director Hideki Itsuno and producer of the game, of course, Dragon's Dogma 2.
5557634	5562379	being developed for PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series and PC via Steam as well.
5562379	5567745	We don't know the release date yet, but soon.
5567745	5573651	So speaking of release dates, let's travel around and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner.
5573651	5575954	We'll go to Loki in the U.S.
5575954	5576194	first.
5577421	5583046	Yep, this is probably going to be one of the last few weeks that we have a few things coming out.
5583046	5589631	So, In the Stars and Time on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.
5589631	5596176	Let's see, we've got Pew Pew, Molcar, Let's Molcar Party on Nintendo Switch.
5597419	5617705	We have Volfaris, MechaTherian on PC, Wordless on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series, Dyschronia, Chronos Alternate on Nintendo Switch, NinjaAisen on PC.
5617705	5619186	And that's it!
5621719	5632284	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there, although I'm going to guess it's probably a pretty slow week, even if the holidays don't flow the same way.
5632284	5637666	Looking at the Nintendo Switch, on the 22nd of November, we have R.E.D.
5637666	5639106	Cherish.
5639106	5639727	It's R.E.
5639727	5642408	colon D, and it's like an anime or a manga.
5642408	5644209	It's not like Resident Evil or something like that.
5644209	5644689	That'd be cool.
5645589	5667486	Dischronia Chronos Alternate Definitive Edition is also out on the 22nd, as is Kud Wafter Converted Edition is out on the Switch as well, and Getsui no Kusari Sakuran Paranoia is out in a regular and special edition in Japan, all of that on the 23rd actually is that game's release.
5667486	5668707	Checking out the PlayStation 5,
5670229	5683881	Stray gets its Japanese release in Japan on November 22nd Meet Your Maker, another game we got here a few months ago, is also out in Japan on the 22nd With that, we can travel over to Europe, DarkSakura!
5687365	5689307	So, just a handful.
5689307	5695654	On the 21st we have Pui Pui Molcar Let's Molcar Party, that's for Switch.
5695654	5701700	On the 23rd for PlayStation and Switch we have Spirit of the Island Paradise Edition.

5710910	5714654	For Xbox, Disney Dreamlight Valley Cozy Edition.

5717738	5724706	For PlayStation, Tintin, Reporters, Cigars, and the Pharaoh Limited Edition.
5724706	5724986	That's it.
5727177	5728118	All right.
5728118	5735983	Well, usually we would do some more stories at this point, but we've kind of hit the end of all the stories we had slotted tonight.
5735983	5742728	Again, it's a little bit of a shorter Newsweek this week, so this is the part where we're going to get into the listener roundtable.
5742728	5749393	But I will say real quick, I'm actually very glad that, DarkSakura, you were reading that story and you mentioned Ayoden Chronicle.
5749993	5766181	because it reminded me, oops, I backed that on Kickstarter, I don't know how many years ago, and I have until this week to pick what platform I get my digital key on, and I forgot to do it, so I'm doing it right now to make sure I get the platform that I want, which I think I'm gonna go with PlayStation 5.
5766181	5770042	I could see why maybe Nintendo Switch, but I'm gonna go with PlayStation 5.
5770042	5777066	I think that's... I thought I'd already picked Xbox some time ago, but I didn't have a PS5 then, so I'm gonna go PS5.
5778447	5780889	I bet I thought you'd all like to know.
5780889	5783171	All right, let's get to the Lister roundtable.
5783171	5785633	Glad that I inadvertently reminded you of a thing.
5785633	5791899	You did because I'd like to get my you know, thing that I paid for and like literally forgot about because it's been so fucking long.
5791899	5794481	But I am excited to play the game to be honest.
5794481	5795562	So there is that.
5798351	5803572	Okay, let's move on and travel list a roundtable.
5803572	5809414	We're gonna invite your emails participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com is the place to send us an email.
5809414	5811495	I think I saw one come in just before the show.
5811495	5812335	We've got one.
5812335	5812835	We've got one.
5812835	5813935	We've got one.
5813935	5814976	Oh my god, there's an email.
5814976	5815576	Hold up.
5815576	5815796	Hold up.
5815796	5816896	We got an email.
5816896	5817796	I'm gonna faint.
5817796	5818297	I'm gonna faint.
5821661	5826113	I feel like, you know, like Janine in Ghostbusters.
5826113	5827777	We've got one.
5827777	5828058	Anyway.
5832003	5834664	So, um, I will start off.
5834664	5837726	Dear OLR fam, it's your girl Mishi here.
5837726	5842148	First and foremost, please excuse the grammatical errors as I am writing this on my cell phone.
5842148	5844329	I'll forgive you this once.
5844329	5846730	Um, uh, now down to what I wanted to say.
5846730	5852632	Y'all, y'all listen, I've never been so disappointed in a game company as I have for the makers of Coral Island.
5852632	5853553	I want to like the game.
5853553	5858135	In fact, I want to love it, but it feels like they're not even trying to fix their mess up.
5858835	5868017	In my honest opinion, they never should have bothered releasing the game on console, especially if they were only planning on releasing half of it for console players.
5868017	5871578	Yes, they're aware of the mess up, but this one's a pretty big one.
5871578	5874539	When are they going to fix it?
5874539	5879200	Might I add, the errors are, as far as I know, on console.
5879200	5881861	Thank goodness I didn't pay for it, because I'd be even more upset.
5883910	5892073	And from what I heard, and please correct me if I'm wrong, they released it so fast because apparently Humble Bundle is going under?
5892073	5893794	I haven't heard anything about that.
5893794	5904938	If that's the case, they never should have released it at all specifically for console, and I'm praying Core Keeper and Roots of Pacha, which are both due out soon on Switch, don't make the same mistake.
5904938	5910440	As a gamer, am I even a little bit wrong for feeling saltier than the Dead Sea?
5910440	5911761	Sincerely, Disgruntled Gamer.
5912665	5914346	How you feel is how you feel.
5914346	5918647	I mean, I don't know the whole situation behind it, and I've never heard of the game before.
5918647	5922508	And I also never heard of anything about Humble Bundle going over.
5922508	5924449	They're going under.
5924449	5925970	So I looked into it a little bit.
5925970	5935413	Humble isn't going under, but in a report from four days ago, which did not make our show roll tonight, Humble Games was the latest to lay off employees.
5936293	5958539	um not really um so humble bundle of course started in 2010 and uh let's see on linkedin some folks were uh reporting that they lost positions saying it's a sad day at humble games for a lot of folks um let's see i realized some digital news outlets have read into my a lot of folks quite literally and linking to my profile trying to do some napkin math
5959079	5966486	When you see, when you have one ounce of empathy, you realize the impact of layoffs on the people who are laid off, of course, but also on the people who are not laid off.
5966486	5968067	And that is indeed a lot of people.
5968067	5977276	So it hasn't been revealed how many were laid off, but that may be why the rumors are swirling the way they are.
5977276	5981239	So it's not the total truth, but there is
5982200	5983922	I'm surprised to hear what happened there
6001771	6015504	Well, like I said, I haven't heard of the game, but if it's a game that you want to love and it's come out in such a tainted edition, then you're well within your rights to feel the way that you do.
6015504	6017146	You're the consumer of this.
6018618	6020358	Exactly.
6020358	6023579	It's Stardew Valley-ish is the game, basically.
6023579	6032661	It's kind of on the backs of that game's popularity, but it has more of like an isometric, we'll say Zelda link to the past kind of look to it.
6032661	6034662	Well, it's not even really sprite based.
6034662	6040063	You know, just it kind of has that more kind of 2D-esque, tilted 2D, we'll say, view of that.
6040063	6043164	So at least from what I've seen of it, it looks cute.
6043164	6047905	I would play it at some point if I didn't have a backlog a mile long to catch up on.
6048385	6052508	So, speaking of, thank you for the email, and we invite more emails.
6052508	6055611	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6055611	6061576	Speaking of catching up, you know, I often turn to the phones that are Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, and they are empty.
6062554	6063795	but not tonight.
6063795	6066016	We have a call waiting to come on the show.
6066016	6066676	I'm excited.
6066676	6068197	Yeah, I know.
6068197	6070738	I was I was hoping to hear from this person last week.
6070738	6074040	But you know what Blanche Devereaux says better late than pregnant.
6074040	6077001	So let's welcome on to the show.
6077001	6078122	Hello, YYR.
6079967	6082329	Ah, I thought you were gonna let me say who I was.
6082329	6084731	No, I decided to ruin it.
6084731	6099764	Plus, as I was laying it up there, I was saying I was actually hoping secretly to hear from you last week, but then the Pokemon Go was telling me why I might not have heard from you last week.
6099764	6102267	What the hell was that?
6102267	6103187	Who hit the shade button?
6103988	6107371	But I didn't know how much of that you wanted me to say on air.
6107371	6110694	So I was just like, okay, I guess I'm not surprised to hear not from YYR.
6110694	6113156	But I'm sure you had to have listened last week.
6113156	6115698	Please tell me you listened to last week's show.
6115698	6118440	I, you know what, I didn't actually get through the whole thing.
6118440	6120402	But I did listen to the opening segment.
6120402	6121623	And that is why I'm calling in tonight.
6121623	6123505	As long as you heard the beginning, as long as you heard, yes, that's fine.
6123505	6123865	That's fine.
6123865	6127008	As long as you heard the beginning, you know, that's, that's the part I needed you to hear.
6127008	6132092	So I'm sure, in the great words of Jerry Blake, I've got something to say.
6133456	6135118	Of course, of course.
6135118	6141363	I mean, I've got something to say about everything.
6141363	6152354	I just wanted to clarify because the thing is, regarding what happened to the North American players with Konami Arcade Championship DDR this year,
6155325	6156987	Yes, it sucks.
6156987	6158828	Yes, it was bullshit.
6158828	6171519	But there is an actual logical reason as to why the American finalists were disqualified that was avoidable, but it's bullshit.
6173618	6186123	But to understand it, I just, I do need to go into a little bit of boring background on Konami's esoteric rules and, you know, what, what led to this.
6186123	6187504	Let me get my pillow.
6187504	6189564	Just kidding.
6189564	6194767	But, well, you may want to get a pen and paper if we still use those things.
6194767	6195867	Oh, it's all about OneNote.
6198371	6203133	Alright, well get your fingers ready then.
6203133	6221682	Basically what it boils down to is, so if you go back to 2016, when DDR Ace released, and I just saw the head almost fall off on Jamie's avatar, so that was fun.
6221682	6222822	So yeah, if you go back to 2016,
6225888	6234410	And now we suddenly had access to a current version of DDR with EMUs and everything.
6234410	6238891	So, of course, we all wanted to sign up.
6238891	6243512	And, you know, you buy the card, you log in for the first time.
6243512	6247333	You don't actually ever need to go to Konami's website.
6247333	6250474	You can use the score saving and whatnot in the game.
6251635	6254777	and unlock things without ever having to do that.
6254777	6269806	But if you want to fully take advantage of the game's features like adding rivals and setting some additional options and entering things like KAC, you do have to create a Konami ID.
6269806	6270807	And when you do that,
6271327	6280655	you have to say, okay, it's this country that I'm creating the Konami ID for, and that country is locked and can't be changed.
6280655	6287881	Though, when the game came out, we all created North American accounts because, well, we're in North America.
6287881	6292806	But after a while, we started to understand that there were certain features
6293427	6297715	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6304795	6316322	The basic course specifically, things like the ability to set certain options in the game, like make your background darker, put the arrows in front of the combo display, you know, stupid stuff.
6316322	6323086	But in order to set these things, you needed a Japanese region account.
6323948	6333595	Now, this wasn't a big deal back then, because what you could do, and what we all did, was create a second Konami ID for Japan region.
6333595	6343982	And then what we could then do is detach our e-amusement pass, the card we use to log in, which exists as a separate entity from your Konami ID.
6343982	6349806	We could detach it from our North American account and just reattach it to the Japanese account.
6349806	6350747	We lose nothing.
6351548	6356149	and we gained a whole lot of extra features.
6356149	6367232	In fact, you need a Japan region account now in order to access all the new home versions of Bimani games.
6367232	6379456	And then when Konami Arcade Championship happened for the first time in DDR Ace, and everyone was super excited about that, we read the rules and it said
6380686	6388608	You have to enter with a Konami ID that matches your region of residence, or you will not be able to enter the finals.
6388608	6390409	So what did we all do?
6390409	6397531	We switched, uh, we switched back from our Japan region to North American region.
6397531	6401512	We detached our card from Japan, reattached it to North America.
6401512	6402092	Boom.
6402092	6404853	We were all able to enter KAC.
6404853	6409994	Three North Americans went to finals that year, and I believe ChrisChike won.
6411116	6412937	And that was a great time.
6412937	6419460	It was exciting to watch, it raised awareness of the game, it got a lot of people excited.
6419460	6421542	Yeah, awesome.
6421542	6423202	Fast forward to now.
6423202	6426344	Oh, and there's one other fact I'm going to throw in.
6426344	6437230	Every year, for I don't even know how long, Konami has added new songs to the game that debut with the KAC qualifiers.
6438237	6445307	You know, because obviously they got to make things a little more challenging, give you something that nobody has ever seen before.
6445307	6446108	Sure.
6446108	6448091	That part's cool.
6448091	6453999	Yeah, but the thing is, in order to unlock those songs, you have to register for KAC.
6456909	6468674	You log in with your card on the website, you basically click a button, and then you're officially entered into KAC, and those songs unlock the next time you play the game.
6468674	6470235	So, that's cool.
6471115	6473017	So anyway, fast forward to this year.
6473017	6484486	So I just want to point out like so far, this is a pretty convoluted system by Konami's own making that everybody just kind of played around with because, you know, they just played along with it because, okay, this is how we get the features.
6484486	6485907	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6485907	6487268	We're used to this shit from Konami.
6487268	6488549	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6488549	6492552	Just give us the new songs because that's essentially what it is.
6492552	6496155	Give us the same features and same songs as you've given everyone else.
6496155	6497356	Just do that.
6497356	6500559	And we'll play this little game so we can just have the same features as everyone else.
6506748	6509549	So anyway, fast forward to this year.
6509549	6515830	This is the first time that North America has been eligible for KAC since pre-COVID.
6515830	6522552	Because what happened, you know, when the year COVID started, they were gonna do KAC, but they
6523912	6540818	Basically, they delayed the finals for more than a year, and limited it to Japan only, and then it was cut down the following year, and so this is the first year that they were actually running a legit KAC and inviting North America to enter again.
6540818	6550221	However, one thing changed, one significant thing changed, back in January of this year, for some reason, I don't know what reason,
6551155	6562365	Konami decided to stop allowing e-amusement passes to be detached from one region's account and added to another region's account.
6562365	6564767	That is no longer possible.
6564767	6573695	So everyone who's playing in North America who has a Japanese Konami ID, guess what?
6573695	6575697	Our cards are stuck in Japan.
6575697	6577018	We can no longer remove them.
6577018	6578139	Why did Konami do this?
6579318	6582919	That is a good question that I do not have the answer for.
6582919	6591182	And that is completely the answer I expected, and I set you up for that, because... Why?
6591182	6592763	What was the reason?
6592763	6594363	There was no reason.
6594363	6596504	Anyway, sorry, please continue.
6596504	6606408	So, what that created was a situation where anyone who wanted to enter KAC needed to buy a second card,
6607179	6621886	you know, create, you know, their account, register for KAC, and then use their sub-account, for lack of a better term, to actually play the songs and qualify and, you know, get the best score possible.
6621886	6635152	However, I'm sure, as someone who gotta catch em all, you know, a fellow gamer who gotta catch em all, you understand the importance of having everything unlocked on your main account, yes?
6635152	6636213	Uh-huh, uh-huh, 100%.
6637950	6647538	Well, the only way to unlock those two songs, as usual, is to register for KAC on your main account.
6647538	6649339	Which they did.
6649339	6651681	And that's the problem.
6651681	6662669	Because another one of the KAC rules that has always been there is, if you enter using multiple accounts, you will be disqualified.
6662669	6662950	So,
6664605	6678575	There was a way that North Americans could compete and not be disqualified, and that was they could not register and unlock those two songs on their main accounts.
6678575	6688523	They would have to intentionally not unlock those songs and wait for them to be unlocked for everybody, which could be one or two years or more.
6690151	6690931	which sucks.
6712438	6723581	If they wanted to know, they could certainly find out how many people are switching their regions and why they might be doing that and read into what the players want if they wanted to do that.
6724366	6731352	Maybe people are switching the regions because there's so many games, their games that are being licensed to U.S.
6731352	6733914	arcades that they want the unlocks on.
6733914	6734535	Like, I don't know.
6734535	6735635	That's stupid.
6735635	6737637	I just, it is stupid.
6737637	6738017	Why?
6738017	6743302	You know, and if the reason was music licensing, we can't have a song here, da, da, da, da, da.
6743302	6743982	Okay.
6743982	6746445	But then why was it open to switching in the first place?
6747085	6749467	you know, because somebody moves.
6749467	6752268	Okay, how often does that actually happen?
6752268	6763295	And you know, maybe if that big life event like that happens, you just either a suck it up and start over or be maybe a longer process of contacting Konami with a piece of mail.
6763295	6764356	I don't fucking know.
6764356	6770420	But it should it should not be what it was now, you know, like it and just to take it away for literally no reason.
6771567	6782027	Yeah, and another thing, because you can't switch to Japan region anymore, the players using these sub-accounts are also at a disadvantage because...
6784914	6785555	Whatchamacallit.
6785555	6795843	Yeah, because you can't make the background darker, and you can't, you know, those options are still locked to Japan region because they're locked behind a subscription, so... For no reason.
6795843	6798665	Why is there a subscription to make the game accessible?
6798665	6803309	Easier to... It's just... Well, that's for Japan, too.
6803309	6806632	The Japanese people have to subscribe to that in order to set that stuff.
6806632	6807433	It doesn't matter.
6807433	6808393	I don't care who has it.
6808393	6809294	It's still bullshit.
6809294	6809574	It is.
6809574	6810955	It's stupid.
6810955	6813257	I'm not going to argue that it's bullshit.
6813257	6813437	So...
6814598	6816419	What's so what's your take on it?
6816419	6817479	So I'm kind of okay.
6817479	6823620	So thank you for laying it out Even though I'm kind of sitting here going okay Konami continues to be convoluted and frustrating.
6823620	6832303	Yes, and and and basically the the emails that like if basically the way the emails read to me is
6833263	6844550	Konami sent to Chris Chaik, who by the way, it was just absolutely gut-wrenching to hear you read his Twitter comments because it sucks.
6844550	6853135	But yeah, the way I read his email, those emails was, you know, Konami sends to Chris, so it looks like
6853855	6856938	You're using multiple accounts, can you explain yourself?
6856938	6864984	And Chris sent what he did, and Konami read that and said, okay, you have confirmed that you use multiple accounts, therefore you're disqualified.
6864984	6867506	What about Korean players?
6867506	6869508	As pointed out in chat by SSJ100Matt.
6871794	6876798	The Korea is basically the same situation as us.
6876798	6890528	And if you're asking about FFM specifically, I don't think he qualified, but he was personally invited to compete in the finals, and he turned them down.
6891761	6895983	I need a fundamental understanding of another question.
6895983	6898864	Didn't Kris win something big the last time there was one of these?
6898864	6900144	Yes, he's won world champion twice.
6910502	6914725	So, I mean, I'm not for people getting special treatment and all that stuff.
6914725	6930474	However, circumstances be what they may, knowing that Konami has these convoluted rules, as Chris points out in his email, why he had to do what he had to do, knowing that Chris is a multiple world championship winning thing, why was he not given a special invitation to do this?
6930894	6933477	That's that that's the part that like doesn't click for me.
6933477	6939364	And like, I don't know the guy very well, if his attitude sucks or something, I would not be aware of it.
6939364	6943689	But I'm not getting that sense at all from people that seem to know him.
6943689	6950277	And the again, the post he made on Twitter seemed very like, I just like, ow, I felt that.
6950777	6952598	like was that that thing he wrote on Twitter.
6952598	6955439	I was like, oh, I felt that like it seemed very like relatable.
6955439	6962102	And so I just I was just kind of in shock that like so why did Konami reach out to some people but not to others?
6962102	6964564	That also doesn't make sense.
6964564	6964984	You know what?
6964984	6970346	You know, I will say he's not 100 percent free of controversy, but I have met him.
6970346	6973068	He's a really cool, chill dude.
6973068	6973568	He is.
6973568	6974528	He's a nice guy.
6974528	6975749	And I feel for him.
6975749	6978450	Well, none of us are free of controversy, to be fair.
6978450	6979551	None of us are free of controversy.
6980391	6982752	So, especially not me.
6982752	6986493	And I don't expect you to be Konami's defense here, YYR.
6986493	6995157	I appreciate you giving a better understanding of this whole thing, but it's just, you know, it's still just- Yeah, I wasn't so much defending them as more explaining what happened.
6996577	6999580	that, yeah, that we hope you continue to support.
6999580	7003143	Yeah, SSJ100 Madden chat says, I hate that they just gave him the canned.
7003143	7005325	We hope you continue to support Konami.
7005325	7009488	And honestly, that's just their standard response.
7009488	7012211	It's a very Japanese company standard response.
7012211	7015033	Probably nobody important that was actually writing that email.
7015033	7022880	But there's that part of me that goes, could no one at Konami like critically think about how they're treating a former world champion?
7023840	7027142	of title not held by many people who advocates for their game.
7027142	7028924	Like, I don't think they care.
7028924	7032246	Well, and then my response is, well, I don't care.
7032246	7036829	So I just, you know, and like, why do we continue to support DDR?
7036829	7039171	Though granted, I don't support it the way I used to.
7039171	7041112	And that part of that's age, stamina, etc.
7041112	7042153	You fill in the blank here.
7042153	7050039	But I just like when I hear about this type of shit, I'm not exactly excited to jump back in and say, Oh, yeah, I got to get back in the DDR community.
7050039	7051500	Because it sounds like a bunch of bullshit.
7054286	7070733	Yeah, it's a very strange time right now between the Dave and Buster's business, the Round One business, and there's a controversial thing they added to the game recently too.
7072694	7096966	Something called... I don't know how familiar you are with the current version of the game where, you know, they give you a choice between the normal mode and the premium mode, and in Japan the premium mode costs more, and in some countries the premium mode costs double, but, you know, it gives you access to extra stage, it's insurance if you fail in the first or second song, you get to keep going, you know, that kind of thing.
7098021	7111171	They've added now something called Galaxy Play, which basically, they've increased over time the amount of plays that you need to unlock a song.
7111171	7113153	They've made that more difficult.
7114113	7120517	They've locked a significant amount of content in the new version.
7120517	7123678	A lot of it has to be unlocked before it can be played.
7123678	7133644	Well, Galaxy Play, if you select that, any song that is not unlocked, you play it once, you don't even need to pass, it's unlocked.
7133644	7135285	Done.
7135285	7136586	And then they added like a...
7138143	7146584	a new event with this update, and normally you have to play nine songs before you can access the event.
7146584	7149705	Now it's three if you pick this thing.
7149705	7151065	It sounds great.
7151065	7157946	It literally costs three credits to play one game of Galaxy Play.
7157946	7162647	You have to swipe your card three times to play once.
7162647	7164488	I got a question for you, YYR.
7164488	7166928	Have you ever played a game called Step Maniacs?
7169950	7174933	I have, it's been a long time since I got to play it.
7174933	7178535	They actually now have in my mall two of them.
7178535	7184919	One of them is apparently the brand new Super Deluxe model, and it costs a fortune to play also.
7184919	7186440	And I love what they've done with it.
7186440	7188061	Yeah, it's a pretty good game, huh?
7188061	7188762	It's a great game.
7188762	7189602	It's a great game.
7189602	7190583	Yeah, I agree.
7190583	7193504	It's a great game.
7193504	7195165	That's all.
7195165	7195946	That's all I have to say.
7196874	7203820	I'm surprised that they haven't tried to do some sort of like, you know, competitive series or something like that as a response.
7203820	7205422	That would have been interesting.
7205422	7207483	Wait, oh, these players aren't invited.
7207483	7209926	Well, we'll just do our own thing and we'll invite those players.
7209926	7219074	So I could see where a particular individual may have PTSD in dealing with legally shaky scenarios involving a certain Japanese company that they would rather not.
7220655	7231437	But I don't think that having a competition is not going to cause any... I don't think having a competition is going to necessarily... No, but it should probably be unofficial.
7231437	7240699	The only thing that stinks is I don't think Step Maniacs has the distribution where, you know, a lot of folks would be able to compete.
7240699	7247440	I think they may be even harder to find than DDR, which is pretty hard to get to already.
7248360	7277837	unless unless you know the right private collector let me tell you let me some some fans be wild some fans be wild in a good way so anyway all right YYR I appreciate you giving the uh additional perspective on that story and uh so forth yeah SJ100 Matt says we've been educated tonight on DDR happy 19 November everybody uh yeah appropriate time I didn't even notice you you of all people didn't even notice
7279289	7280510	I love it.
7280510	7282471	Guilty.
7282471	7283392	All right.
7283392	7288795	YY, any closing thoughts for us tonight before we let you go?
7288795	7292477	Please continue to look forward to Super Duper Multitasking.
7292477	7294658	It's actually nearing completion.
7294658	7295719	I can say that now.
7295719	7296579	I'm excited.
7296579	7301662	I've been working very hard on it for like the last six months.
7301662	7303263	But you have a life as well.
7303263	7304324	And it's just you.
7304324	7305405	Yeah, I get it.
7305405	7305745	I get it.
7306641	7310842	But yeah, I'm working on the new missions now.
7310842	7312743	Some of them are disgustingly hard.
7312743	7318764	And I was going to say, and a baby, but the more I think about it, I'm like, your baby's probably like three or four at this point.
7318764	7319985	She's five and a half now.
7319985	7321205	Oh, Jesus Christ.
7321205	7322205	Where have I been?
7322205	7323466	What is time?
7323466	7331828	She's in kindergarten and she came home last week and she's like, my friend said that she didn't want to be my friend anymore.
7331828	7333789	And she's ignoring me on the playground.
7333789	7334749	I'm like, already?
7336385	7340587	You're only five and you have to go through this already?
7340587	7341527	Who's that other kid?
7341527	7344188	What a bitch.
7344188	7351470	I think by the end of the week it was all buddy buddy again.
7351470	7360874	I mean, isn't there the general, you know, memory of a cat, you know, 17 minutes and then everything's fine?
7360874	7361914	I don't know about that.
7361914	7364495	They remember a whole lot that I forget.
7365537	7368218	He's already like reminded me of stuff.
7368218	7370458	And I'm like, on one hand, thank you.
7370458	7373339	And on the other hand, I felt real dumb.
7373339	7375180	It's all right.
7375180	7385183	All right, well, YYR, I'm gonna let you go and look forward to all the continued YYR Games releases that you have in the pipeline and realize that good things take time.
7385183	7386143	And if you don't believe me,
7386863	7389124	Look at Baldur's Gate 3.
7389124	7390044	Same approach.
7390044	7390304	All right.
7390304	7392045	Fair point.
7392045	7392325	All right.
7392325	7393606	Well, thanks again for the show.
7393606	7394146	Have a great week.
7394146	7394586	Thank you.
7394586	7395326	Take care, YYR.
7395326	7396266	Thanks for calling.
7396266	7396647	Take care.
7396647	7397647	See you later.
7397647	7398987	Bye.
7398987	7402669	What a lovely little present for 19 November here.
7402669	7405470	And we appreciate YYR giving us a call.
7405470	7409851	With that, I do want to turn it over to any final thoughts.
7409851	7413893	Actually, no, before I get to final thoughts, I'm sorry, last minute stories or anything else people want to discuss before we wrap it up.
7416523	7420546	Um, yeah, I don't think I had anything.
7420546	7422067	All right.
7422067	7423889	Um, I actually had one thing.
7423889	7426651	So Loki, I just I've been kind of multitasking a lot.
7426651	7428332	And I haven't really been able to focus.
7428332	7431035	But is there a reason why the video playing behind you tonight?
7431035	7433637	It's just three logos cycling over and over again.
7433637	7437100	It doesn't actually show any gameplay for the last two hours.
7437768	7441290	I don't know why it's doing that if it keeps resetting.
7441290	7442211	It's just the Konami.
7442211	7443671	It's one of those things like I didn't realize.
7443671	7445613	I just figured, oh, I'm just not looking at the right moments.
7445613	7449975	But now that, you know, I've been listening to YYR, just kind of like staring and I'm watching the video play behind you.
7449975	7455678	It's probably, it's probably just, like, is it an attract mode that broke?
7455678	7456479	Maybe.
7456479	7458060	It's, it's Simpsons Bowling.
7458060	7460221	Yes, I see that.
7460221	7463463	By Konami and Fox Entertainment.
7463463	7465944	I don't understand why it's not.
7468474	7468554	and
7490450	7496638	The whole point was supposed to be because I couldn't think of something that, you know, correlated with Thanksgiving.
7496638	7498800	And if you roll three strikes, what's it called?
7498800	7500022	A turkey.
7500022	7501524	Oh, that's a big brain reference.
7501524	7502645	Good for you.
7502645	7503266	That's good.
7503266	7506810	But instead, it's the Simpsons bowling logo, Konami.
7507751	7509294	FBI Warning, winners don't use drugs
7523235	7535706	My Tron machine got a firmware update last week and I was like, ooh, that's cool, a firmware update.
7535706	7537608	Sometimes they add new games with these.
7537608	7538929	Obviously, it was nothing like that.
7538929	7544574	I was like, hey, maybe it's just a minor fix that I don't know what it did or whatever.
7545154	7549177	I go to turn on the machine today, and do you know what greets me?
7549177	7555741	Brand new thing I've never seen before, an advertisement.
7555741	7560384	Arcade one up, Black Friday sale going on now with a QR code.
7560384	7564427	That's what that firmware added in the machine, the ability to throw an advertisement.
7565519	7565619	and
7583030	7588933	after because I was taking a picture and uploading it to social media going what the fuck, blah, blah, blah, except I don't use shitter anymore.
7588933	7590553	So I can't actually tag arcade one up.
7590553	7593715	But I can I can still I can still scream into the ether.
7593715	7596056	And that's what people do on the internet very well.
7596056	7602378	And so I was I was posting all that and while I was writing that the screen did go away and it defaulted into attract mode.
7602378	7605960	So that that splash does go away after a certain amount of time.
7605960	7608241	But I noticed it and I wasn't happy.
7609724	7614970	which actually sucks because there are some sales where I'm like, oh, I'm tempted.
7614970	7618513	But I spent money on shop cards instead.
7618513	7620075	So I have Mario RPG coming.
7620075	7622117	So there's that.
7622117	7622337	Anyway.
7623379	7626343	All right, that's that's good enough for random other topics.
7626343	7627864	We can move to wrap things up.
7627864	7630648	So thank you all as always for listening to Orange Dance Radio.
7630648	7634812	We hope you enjoyed what you heard here tonight.
7634812	7638136	If you liked what you heard, tell a friend or five about the show, help us spread the word.
7638136	7641480	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
7642421	7650666	a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is you heard this podcast go an awful long way.
7650666	7654008	With all that, I would like to wrap it up.
7654008	7661113	So also, I want to wish everybody a happy Thanksgiving for those that celebrate here in the States this week.
7661113	7668898	If nothing else, I hope you have good family time if that's the thing you're into or just catching up on your fucking video game backlog because maybe you don't have to work for a couple days.
7669398	7674682	DarkSakura, let's go to you and your final thought because I'm sure you're going to do some deading by delighting.
7694802	7706916	I am pretty discouraged by the fact that I can't find a true red bun for my hair because I have to have a fake bun for ballet recital and this is just aggravating.
7706916	7712122	This means that I've had to buy extensions in the right hair color and make my own damn bun.
7712122	7714985	Yes, I will have my ballerina bun.
7714985	7715326	Damn it.
7716462	7717583	Please send a picture.
7717583	7729772	Also, I totally learned how to do a pas de chat and I'm very, very happy because a pas de chat is the step of the cat and it is such a cute step and I'm glad I can do one now.
7729772	7739219	When I think of the ballet, I think about how every single year we had to go see the Nutcracker downtown because a girl in our school was in it without fail every single year.
7739219	7742141	So, DarkSakura, will I ever get to see you in a production of the Nutcracker?
7744552	7757801	Well, we are doing the flutes from Nutcracker and my you can get a ticket on the set for this for the 17th Maybe I'll see what I'm doing that day So I'll send you a link to it.
7757801	7771870	Just don't let me forget Okay, also Hanukkah happens before Christmas, so I better get doughnuts damn it All right, just saying all right enjoy I have a good one will do
7773092	7777117	All right, with that we go to Loki and your final thought tonight.
7777117	7786266	If it was a Simpsons themed killer in DVD, would it be dead by donut or death by donuts?
7786266	7787268	Dead by donuts.
7787268	7788929	Forbidden donut.
7788929	7790011	Forbidden donuts.
7790011	7791352	Yes.
7791352	7792834	As long as Homer is the survivor.
7792834	7793014	Yes.
7794852	7817824	uh and my final thought is there was actually a um there was actually i wanted to say a portal but it was actually a pikmin mushroom that we went on that was something like it wasn't forbidden donut but it was like loud pink what was the name of the donut it was something like pink donuts frosted pink donuts and it was these giant i thought it was the cutest uh little picture and postcard i've seen in pikmin bloom yet and i think i sent it to mrs black wolf i think
7819702	7825366	And I'm going to have to go back by there to get more postcards because I love the pink donut postcard.
7825366	7831630	And Pikmin is always great for exercise and all that good stuff, just not when it's raining.
7831630	7841677	I did a very poor job in the weekly challenge this week and had to get carried by the other people in the challenge because it was raining and it's it's a lot of work to go walk in the rain, don't you think?
7841677	7841857	Yeah.
