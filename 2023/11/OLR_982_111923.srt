1
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:14,120
[SPEAKER_06]: My Gaming Week has been waiting for Super Mario RPG all week, and then getting it on Friday.

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,322
[SPEAKER_06]: My Gaming Weekend has been playing Super Mario RPG all weekend.

3
00:00:17,322 --> 00:00:18,642
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a good Geek Week.

4
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:24,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario RPG, Scott Pilgrim takes off, award season announcements, Half-Life updates, and so much more.

5
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:28,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It truly is the most wonderful time to edge still closer to the end of the year.

6
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:29,928
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Voice of Geeks intro.

7
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:37,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Somers, and Loki to tell you about most of these things and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show, wherever your gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:41,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my friends out there on the Internet.

9
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:46,794
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:49,736
[SPEAKER_01]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

11
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:52,037
[SPEAKER_01]: We are live once again tonight.

12
00:00:52,037 --> 00:01:02,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode 982 of our show, November 19th of 2023 or 19 November, as we might have joked about many years ago.

13
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:05,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Rob Roberts, and I'm here with you all tonight with my co-host.

14
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,427
[SPEAKER_02]: who is not coming through for some reason.

16
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:18,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,812
[SPEAKER_02]: On mute.

18
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:20,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there you go.

19
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:21,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, how are you?

20
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:22,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

21
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:22,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

22
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:30,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm irritated, apparently, with whatever's going on with the system.

23
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fun.

24
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:36,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the shirt that your VTuber is wearing with Bad Cat.

25
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:39,187
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the outfit that your VTuber is in tonight.

26
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:39,587
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cute.

27
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:42,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

28
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I made it last night.

29
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:44,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

30
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.

31
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Also say hello.

32
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining us every week.

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

34
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:51,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

35
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:51,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Loki.

36
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:52,593
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?

37
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.

38
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,777
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tech problems all over the place tonight because your video is frozen for us.

39
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:02,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was going to say, why do you just have a static Simpsons bowling logo behind you tonight?

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:10,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's because XSplit VCam has been stupid for the last, I don't know how long.

41
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:16,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I guess since a lot of people take the next week off of work, a lot of our technical equipment decided to do the same.

42
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:17,109
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you say?

43
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:20,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this has been doing this for weeks now, so I don't know.

44
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:30,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a combination between the software just sucking in also between, I think, Windows and assigning like device IDs to USB devices.

45
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:34,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it seems like every time I get an update that it resets everything.

46
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:36,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's probably part of it.

47
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:54,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want to join us live to point and laugh at all the tech fail, you sure can, because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, where we do tape live right after Bobby Blackwolf Show on Sunday nights.

48
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:57,139
[SPEAKER_01]: You starting to say something, Jamie?

49
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:05,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, actually, I know I need to do my system upgrade and upgrade my OBS.

50
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So for me, it could just be an OBS issue.

51
00:03:06,994 --> 00:03:09,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm, maybe, maybe.

52
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:10,176
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

53
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get into some news.

54
00:03:12,638 --> 00:03:20,383
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have as much news this week with, you know, this was a big week for game releases, as Jason kind of talked about in the intro there.

55
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:25,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Mario RPG, I know, is taking over a lot of people's gaming weeks this weekend.

56
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:26,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadly, not mine.

57
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:28,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I had some other stuff going on.

58
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:29,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get around to it yet.

59
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan to.

60
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:34,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably something I'll get to in the next week.

61
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:35,374
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that was

62
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:42,784
[SPEAKER_01]: With that and the releases this week, the rest of them, it's really kind of the last big releases of the year.

63
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:45,288
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have an Avatar game out in December.

64
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:48,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I'd put that in the big release category, even if it is based off a big movie.

65
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:51,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ubisoft does weird December releases for some reason for their games.

66
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:55,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Mario RPG was really the last big, big release of the year.

67
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:04,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's kind of like, OK, finally, this year of just really behemoth game releases has been put down in front of us.

68
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:11,390
[SPEAKER_01]: We now can take a look back at the year 2023, which has really been a fantastic year for gaming releases.

69
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Not such a great year for gaming studios.

70
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,973
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of have to juggle both of those things.

71
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:19,676
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk a little bit more about that a little later in the program.

72
00:04:20,316 --> 00:04:26,758
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can talk about celebrating some of the great releases of the year this year with the Game Awards.

73
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:36,041
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Game Awards, of course, been running for a few years now, trying to be to the video game industry what basically the Oscars is to movies.

74
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say

75
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:49,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe more what the Grammys is to me, even though I can't stand the Grammys, but you know, it's trying to go, because it's a little bit less formal than the Oscars, but maybe something like, or maybe the Emmys, I don't know, the Golden Globes, it's a little less formal.

76
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:52,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they've had their own set of problems over the years.

77
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:54,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if any of those are... I prefer the Golden Girls.

78
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:57,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The Golden Girls of Must See TV.

79
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:11,938
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but obviously Jeff Keighley started the Game Awards a few years ago to really try to bring a little bit more pomp, circumstance, and of course, you know, recognition to the industry in a little bit more of a formal way.

80
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:15,020
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Game Award shows before.

81
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,843
[SPEAKER_01]: The G4 Network had that G4ia thing.

82
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:21,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Spike TV did something, and I don't even remember what it was called.

83
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:25,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the... I think they just called it like the Game Awards.

84
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:26,489
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like the Spike TV...

85
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:33,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it'll show you what a great impression it made on all of us that we can't even remember.

86
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, VGA says Bobby Blackwold.

87
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:36,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

88
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:37,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sounds familiar now.

89
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:38,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

90
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:45,178
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, obviously those were trying to be a little bit too much, you know, what they think the people want to see.

91
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:52,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Game Awards, you know, love him or hate him, Jeff Keighley, I think, has a much bigger pulse on what gamers kind of want to see.

92
00:05:52,301 --> 00:06:01,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good mix of the awards, the speeches that go with them, and the big trailers, the must-see, you know, game announcement trailers, because, you know,

93
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:02,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto 6

94
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:24,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when we first had the trailer for No Man's Sky, that just came out of nowhere.

95
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what the heck is this?

96
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,577
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing.

97
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:28,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

98
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:38,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I even think just as recently as last year, like the Death Stranding 2 trailer, because a lot of the rumors were pointing that Kojima was doing a horror game.

99
00:06:38,804 --> 00:07:07,804
[SPEAKER_01]: and so people were kind of expecting that and then what we kind of got instead was very different until that moment you see Norman Reedus and then it's like oh this is Death Stranding 2 so um you know there's been there's been some pretty um pretty exciting announcements over the years and uh it looks like this year we'll we'll get some more so but tied in with that is the awards themselves and some people kind of get excited about the awards some people can kind of give or take them i don't know i don't know if excited the right word because how do i feel about the awards

100
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,665
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that they happen.

101
00:07:10,665 --> 00:07:11,685
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

102
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:26,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's very hard to judge art in this kind of way, I do think Jeff has set up a good show to recognize the industry and to give a little clout for, you know, like an award and that type of thing.

103
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,193
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, yeah, that's cool.

104
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, do they always get it right?

105
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:38,416
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but neither do the Oscars, neither do the Grammys or any of those shows get it right.

106
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:45,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit about what did get nominated this year and try to talk a little bit about what all goes into that.

107
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:48,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, do you want to kind of highlight maybe some key categories for us?

108
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we need to, because there's a lot of categories.

109
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we need to do it all, but maybe some of the key categories.

110
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:54,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's see here.

111
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:59,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So, some of the categories, obviously, Game of the Year.

112
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:07,698
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the contentious, not contentious, surprising, I guess, things about Game of the Year is that Starfield is not nominated for Game of the Year.

113
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:16,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, I mean, Baldur's Gate 3, and even Alan Wake 2, I think are pretty, like, that makes sense.

114
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:19,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Spider-Man 2, Resident Evil 4, Super Mario Bros.

115
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:21,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonder, and The Legend of Zelda, Tears of the Kingdom.

116
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:24,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Starfield gets ignored in Game of the Year

117
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: and Buggy.

118
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:07,711
[SPEAKER_01]: The most shocking omission to me is an indie title.

119
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:15,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have thought that something like Sea of Stars, Cocoon, something in those lines sneaks in here.

120
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,557
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not that shocked.

121
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you mentioned these six games, I'm like, I'm not that shocked.

122
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I played all these games?

123
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,081
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

124
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:31,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I feel like I listen to people enough and have a pulse enough on social media and all that that this list of six surprises me?

125
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:32,286
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.

126
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:37,010
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think this seems like a fine and to be expected list.

127
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:43,115
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I think it's going to be the biggest non-surprise when Baldur's Gate 3 walks away with it.

128
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:43,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it does.

129
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:44,956
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be amazing.

130
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:52,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, and I see a lot of great things about that game winning too, especially when you talk about a lot of the industry stuff that's been going on this year.

131
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:59,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Larian is a studio that really took the time to get it right, didn't crunch, made sure they put out a polished product that was very rich without the DLC.

132
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:06,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, I can say all that and at the same time recognize, some of you may have remembered, I attempted to stream that on my channel.

133
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:09,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a big deal out of it and was like, oh, Shane and I are going to do multiplayer.

134
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I canceled it after two streams and not like for a lazy reason, but for a, I'm not having fun reason.

135
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:33,840
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that might sound shocking to say, but if you go back and listen to what we were saying, I said, this game is almost too open-ended where I'm able to make these mistakes live on air that are not fun to watch me go and recover from, and I'm not feeling like I'm moving forward at all whatsoever in this game.

136
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really want to play this game until I have an FAQ that could just walk me the whole way through the game.

137
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:55,085
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I can still have that personal opinion of my issues with it, and at the same time recognize, damn, this is like playing a Bioware game at its best, which is no, you know, if you consider the history of that series, there's no surprise there.

138
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:59,206
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's got great character development, great voice acting, great story.

139
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:03,627
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally feels like you're in the middle of a tabletop D&D campaign.

140
00:11:04,187 --> 00:11:06,949
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got so much right with that game.

141
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does to me.

142
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

143
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:13,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, I was agreeing with you.

144
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:23,339
[SPEAKER_08]: I started the game and I've been busy, but every impression I've got down to the dice rolls and the narration of just being in a really good game.

145
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

146
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:30,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think especially now at this time when a lot more people have been getting into tabletop game, I think in part

147
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Baldur's Gate 3

148
00:11:50,143 --> 00:12:05,162
[SPEAKER_01]: any like Dark Horse or whatever you want to call it, maybe Alan Wake 2 just because it seems to be riding a lot of recency buzz and there's a lot of like artistic decisions in that game that seem to be very very well done including the soundtrack

149
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:06,343
[SPEAKER_01]: and Zelda.

150
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,014
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those other four are winning.

151
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:26,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

152
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:27,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be shocked.

153
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:28,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anything can happen.

154
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:35,331
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've had shock Oscar wins before, but I would be absolutely shocked if one of the other four won.

155
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:35,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Shocked.

156
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,571
[SPEAKER_01]: because that would mean somehow the Nintendo vote didn't split.

157
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,892
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually the most surprising thing to me.

158
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:48,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we've had two Nintendo games nominated in the same year since.

159
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:50,174
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it did happen one other time.

160
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was Zelda and Mario.

161
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,916
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey went up against each other.

162
00:12:56,636 --> 00:13:01,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's taken those two coming out in the same year to go up against each other again.

163
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And that and that's I actually think Wonder is great.

164
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:06,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think they're both great.

165
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:11,849
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am still surprised to see them both nominated because usually Nintendo kind of splits those type of awards.

166
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:18,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, let's see other categories we can talk about.

167
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:19,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So adaptation.

168
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:22,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is basically games to other media like

169
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:33,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania Nocturne, the Netflix animated series, Gran Turismo, The Last of Us, Super Mario Bros.

170
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Movie, Twisted Metal

171
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:54,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly a little too late for the Scott Pilgrim anime, but that may be something that's next year.

172
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:58,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Scott Pilgrim also isn't based on a game.

173
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott Pilgrim was a game, but it was a manga first.

174
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:02,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's true.

175
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could see them doing it.

176
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see best best independent game.

177
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:12,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Cocoon, Dave the Diver, Dredge, Sea of Stars.

178
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna make you go back because I do want to comment real quick on the adaptation thing because there was a spirited debate about it in our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord if you want to join

179
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:48,480
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation throughout the week and this is one of the conversations they were talking about because we had one listener who was pretty passionate that Mario is the best adaptation and ought to win and some other folks that are like dude there's no way The Last of Us doesn't win this and I can completely like you know again I really try to put myself in other people's shoes that's you know for all the Rob Stradamus jokes I've been getting this year one way I try to act make the predictions best I can is try to look at things from other perspectives and so forth

180
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally see why somebody would like something like the Mario movie.

181
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:59,170
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good movie, and it's family-friendly, it's cute, it's fun, it's self-referential to video games.

182
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.

183
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:06,077
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I also look at something like The Last of Us, and the way that that is breaking through

184
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:14,587
[SPEAKER_01]: to an audience of people, an artistic, if you want to say, the Oscar voting category, the Emmy voting category.

185
00:15:14,587 --> 00:15:20,774
[SPEAKER_01]: The Last of Us is breaking through in a way video game adaptations just don't fucking do.

186
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:21,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as

187
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:27,021
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people of a certain age at this point understand video games are fun.

188
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:27,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games are fun.

189
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:28,563
[SPEAKER_01]: They're silly.

190
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,966
[SPEAKER_01]: They're entertaining, right?

191
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:36,372
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think everybody in that same group also understands video games are also art.

192
00:15:36,372 --> 00:15:41,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And video games can tell very good, moving, emotional stories.

193
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:49,663
[SPEAKER_01]: But The Last of Us has now pushed that through in a way into that more mainstream medium that I don't think video game adaptations have done yet.

194
00:15:49,663 --> 00:15:53,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I think The Last of Us, easy win in that category.

195
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:54,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy, easy win.

196
00:15:54,606 --> 00:16:00,250
[SPEAKER_01]: While I can still respect the perspective of family fun, popcorn should be worth something.

197
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but it's going to be Last of Us' year.

198
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:03,432
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

199
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:05,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.

200
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:07,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I like the Super Mario Bros.

201
00:16:07,183 --> 00:16:14,007
[SPEAKER_04]: movie, but I could also see that it's a very... Like, it's not going to be touted for its writing or anything like that.

202
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's a good adaptation, but it's not like...

203
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:20,134
[SPEAKER_04]: a great movie.

204
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:32,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good movie, but it's not like, you know, one that you go back to like, wow, this is, you know, incredibly written, incredibly animated, you know, such a great story and great characters and all that stuff.

205
00:16:32,183 --> 00:16:34,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just very surface.

206
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:37,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have an eight year old at home, it's something you can put on at loop to entertain them.

207
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it's there's nothing wrong with it.

208
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,931
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.

209
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:45,113
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, there's nothing wrong with entertainment.

210
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:46,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, there's nothing wrong.

211
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:55,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, literally, why on earth would anyone ever watch either a soap opera, or pro wrestling, because those are essentially the same thing.

212
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do people watch either one of those things?

213
00:16:57,803 --> 00:17:01,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sometimes you just want to shut your fucking brain off and be entertained.

214
00:17:01,406 --> 00:17:04,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there's nothing wrong with that at all.

215
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, you're frozen again, by the way.

216
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see your reactions and it's killing me.

217
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:10,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

218
00:17:10,524 --> 00:17:11,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

219
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:12,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to do with this.

220
00:17:12,926 --> 00:17:15,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just being stupid.

221
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,149
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.

222
00:17:16,149 --> 00:17:19,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Have to keep refreshing it and be like, Hey, remember, there's a camera attached to this.

223
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:21,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, Oh, okay.

224
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:22,335
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

225
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, sorry, you were starting to read another category before I cut you off.

226
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's see.

227
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:30,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Best Indie Game.

228
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:32,545
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about this in chat right now.

229
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:36,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to... Yeah, there's contention here too.

230
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:43,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Cocoon, Dave the Diver, Dredge, Sea of Stars, and Viewfinder.

231
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:51,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem here, I think, that people have had is Dave the Diver is... Mint Rocket is owned by Tencent, I believe.

232
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:52,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's like...

233
00:17:54,554 --> 00:17:56,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you really an indie studio?

234
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:58,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they're treated like an indie studio.

235
00:17:58,135 --> 00:17:59,636
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Nexon, but it's Nexon, not Tencent.

236
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:01,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Nexon.

237
00:18:01,596 --> 00:18:03,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a massive company.

238
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:10,679
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, if you want to take that one step further, it was either the producer, the director, somebody made a comment on Twitter that essentially said, this isn't an indie game.

239
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,261
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intentionally set up to look like an indie game, but they actually have a tweet out there that is like, this is not an indie game.

240
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for what it's worth, it won't win.

241
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:19,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you

242
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:51,234
[SPEAKER_01]: The onus is going to be on Jeff to better define what that means in the next year.

243
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:52,915
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean to be an indie?

244
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:57,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it mean you have a certain amount of money or less circling around?

245
00:18:57,037 --> 00:19:04,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be very curious to hear him better define what is that other than what it seems to be right now, which is a vibe.

246
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:08,227
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a vibe.

247
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:10,289
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes an indie game a vibe?

248
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what Dave the Diver was going for.

249
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:18,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not knocking the game, but when they come out and say it's not an indie game, it was just a vibe.

250
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:21,820
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem.

251
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

252
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:27,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Next category.

253
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:38,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll do these two because, uh, at least the first one's not necessarily my cup of tea, but best mobile game.

254
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:47,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, which was that the, uh, the MOBA game?

255
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the, was that one that they like, no, I don't think this is the one that they shut down, the live service one.

256
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:54,142
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

257
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:54,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

258
00:19:55,168 --> 00:20:04,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Honkai StarRail, Hello Kitty Island Adventure, Monster Hunter Now, and TerraNil.

259
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best VR AR game.

260
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:09,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, because you know I got something to say on everything, Loki.

261
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:12,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure nothing about Monster Hunter Now, of course not.

262
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I mean, obviously, obviously I've been playing quite a bit of that game.

263
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,647
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean I don't know.

264
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:21,171
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to judge the criteria of what makes a good mobile game.

265
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:22,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I play very few of them.

266
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:30,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you why I think Monster Hunter Now is actually a decent candidate, because it's something, again, unique to the mobile experience.

267
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:35,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so sure a game like Final Fantasy VII Ever Crisis, I'm sure it's a fine game.

268
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:38,547
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it really bringing that's unique to mobile?

269
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:41,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to see the games judged a little more on that.

270
00:20:43,912 --> 00:20:44,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

271
00:20:58,143 --> 00:21:00,064
[SPEAKER_01]: above some of those other games that got nominated for me.

272
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:22,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually legit shocked that was not in more discussions when we talked about Game of the Year.

273
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:30,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think Street Fighter 6 is a perfect example of a game that got lost in 2023, which really sucks for some people.

274
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:33,007
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to see it there and I think it ought to win.

275
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:36,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And you all know I love Diablo 4.

276
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand that game a lot harder than most people think I should.

277
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:48,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say all that and completely recognize multiplayer is actually I think its weakest part because the leveling system is not designed as smart as it was in 3.

278
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:53,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually don't think Diablo 4 ought to win best multiplayer.

279
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:58,324
[SPEAKER_01]: So go go Street Fighter 6 go ahead.

280
00:21:58,324 --> 00:21:58,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

281
00:21:59,522 --> 00:21:59,582
[SPEAKER_02]: and

282
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:17,244
[SPEAKER_01]: HiFiRush got a surprising amount of nominations.

283
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:23,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when that game first came out, people were saying Game of the Year, but then, you know, the rest of 2023 happened.

284
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:27,510
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it still got something like five nominations or something like that.

285
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:40,357
[SPEAKER_01]: For all the talk about the Microsoft hate in the, you know, Game of the Year or whatever, HiFiRush still did very well for itself, considering how much hype went into building up that game, which was literally none.

286
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:41,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a stealth release.

287
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead Island 2

288
00:22:58,353 --> 00:22:59,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what else.

289
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:01,175
[SPEAKER_04]: How about best RPG?

290
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:09,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's where we get Baldur's Gate 3, Final Fantasy 16, Lies of Pea, Sea of Stars and Starfield.

291
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,421
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's quite a lineup.

292
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:13,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any doubt what wins in that category?

293
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:13,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any doubt?

294
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:17,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to be Final Fantasy 16, but like, or Baldur's Gate 3.

295
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:21,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Baldur's Gate 3, easily.

296
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:24,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do the performance, and then that's probably the last one we need to talk about.

297
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Performance, we have Ben Starr for Final Fantasy XVI

298
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Cameron Monaghan for Star Wars Jedi Survivor.

299
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:54,926
[SPEAKER_04]: He's actually pretty good too, so I'd like to see either one of them.

300
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:58,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Idris Elba for Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty.

301
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:09,277
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Melanie Lybird for Alan Wake 2, Neil Newborn for Baldur's Gate 3, and Yuri Lowenthal for Spider-Man 2.

302
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:18,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really comes down to Ben Starr and the voice actor for Asterion in Baldur's Gate.

303
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:32,553
[SPEAKER_01]: It's between the two of them because they both just won an award at a comparable ceremony overseas, but Asterion was best supporting and Clive was best leading or whatever you want to say.

304
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:34,014
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it comes down to the two of them.

305
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:41,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if Ben Starr's very smart social media presence

306
00:24:42,642 --> 00:24:43,882
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't help him take this.

307
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:48,403
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting because the fans only get 10% of the vote.

308
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,264
[SPEAKER_01]: The jury votes for the other 90%.

309
00:24:50,264 --> 00:24:54,545
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is one where I could see that that 10% makes a difference.

310
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:59,906
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think Baldur's Gate has just as many fans as Ben Starr does.

311
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:01,666
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be a tough call for many people.

312
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:11,169
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's going to be people that kind of are swayed towards Ben Starr because he has played the social media game so, so well since.

313
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:11,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Because think about it.

314
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:19,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben Starr's voice acting career, he has like one well known thing on his resume, one.

315
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:21,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And look what he's turned that into.

316
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:24,418
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's, he's very, very smart.

317
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:27,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give him that and he can very well take this award.

318
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,223
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I don't think any I don't think anybody would complain.

319
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:35,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I think even the Baldur's Gate 3 fans would say like, look, if we're going to lose to anybody, it's going to be Ben Starr.

320
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:36,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So and that

321
00:25:37,468 --> 00:25:42,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and that sucks because there's actually a lot of other great talent in there, too.

322
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:44,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget the character name.

323
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:49,896
[SPEAKER_01]: The gal they added in Alan Wake 2 that she voices in that game apparently is a great character.

324
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:53,938
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just like, unfortunately, these other characters are like it's coming down to those two.

325
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:57,700
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to get lost in the Ben Starr and, you know, Asterion debate.

326
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what it is.

327
00:26:01,055 --> 00:26:03,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually Questbuster brings up a great point.

328
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:09,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised Ralph Innocent wasn't nominated too from Final Fantasy 16.

329
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:10,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how about Diablo 4?

330
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:12,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he was also in that game and did very well.

331
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought he was great as Sid.

332
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

333
00:26:15,579 --> 00:26:21,601
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is interesting that we don't consider people's body of work with this award.

334
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:29,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe if we had considered what Ralph Innocent did this year, Innocent, Innocent, what all he did this year, he actually would be up he had some

335
00:26:30,383 --> 00:26:38,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, Final Fantasy and Diablo 4 were released weeks apart, and he played memorable characters in both of those games.

336
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:41,408
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good year for that guy.

337
00:26:41,408 --> 00:26:45,610
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little surprising to not see him in this list.

338
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I would want to take anybody else off of it.

339
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an interesting year.

340
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:54,034
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

341
00:26:54,034 --> 00:27:04,566
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100Math in chat has been looking at some of the like the betting, you know, the the I guess there's, you know, CD websites you can go to if you want.

342
00:27:04,566 --> 00:27:05,406
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say CD.

343
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:08,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It is legal in some places, but I don't know how I feel about all that stuff.

344
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,332
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can go look at what the odds makers are saying about these sorts of races.

345
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:16,755
[SPEAKER_01]: NSJ100 Matt says the betting odds for Ben Starr to win are pretty high.

346
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:21,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Bobby Blackwell says hopefully this means at least Ben Starr will present an award.

347
00:27:21,117 --> 00:27:22,598
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want Ben Starr on stage.

348
00:27:24,301 --> 00:27:32,144
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think of the MTV Movie Awards and how they used to do like parodies and things that would actually have big celebrities in them.

349
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:40,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you ever seen some of those skits that they would do on the awards, they'd have, you know, I would love to see Ben Starr in the Zelda movie.

350
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:45,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they should show him auditioning for the part of Link in the Zelda movie, I think would be very funny.

351
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:47,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Saga Andersen

352
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:10,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, is that related?

353
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:20,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, apparently it's more like you will understand Alan Wake 2 without having played Control, but my friend is more like Control is the best video game I've ever played.

354
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:24,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't play that before you play Alan Wake 2, I'm going to be mad at you type of thing.

355
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I understand.

356
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,591
[SPEAKER_01]: But but but apparently there is benefit to having played both.

357
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:33,432
[SPEAKER_01]: That is also interesting.

358
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:35,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a little bit of a universe there.

359
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:36,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So

360
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:45,922
[SPEAKER_01]: MikeDef says control is not needed to understand Alan Wake 2, but it is connected because of DLC.

361
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:52,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Questbuster says there are references, but you don't absolutely need to play it first.

362
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonce006 with a good point, the Halo TV series got no mention.

363
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch, wasn't that last year though?

364
00:28:58,416 --> 00:28:59,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that was last year.

365
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:00,337
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't this year.

366
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:01,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but you know what?

367
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:06,558
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a very similar reaction because I was like, where was the League of Legends anime?

368
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:07,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody went crazy.

369
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is the League of Legends anime not... It was because it won last year.

370
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my sense of time is so fucked these days.

371
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:20,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, there are so many spinoffs of League of Legends nowadays.

372
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:23,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there is even maybe multiple animated series.

373
00:29:23,143 --> 00:29:25,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very possible to like...

374
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:26,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Miss something.

375
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is Arcane, by the way.

376
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:29,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never remember the name.

377
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:35,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember Arcane, but I swear that we talked about it in release dates last week even, or this week.

378
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another spinoff game for League of Legends, so there's a lot of spinoffs there.

379
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:40,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

380
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,232
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, if the quality is as good as what Arcane apparently was, we can see why.

381
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:50,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's talk about the games we have been playing this week.

382
00:29:50,713 --> 00:29:52,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for running that down for us, Loki.

383
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:56,294
[SPEAKER_01]: December 7th is the date of the awards ceremony.

384
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:03,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Blackwolf and I, and potentially my co-hosts here, need to talk about who might want to get together and stream that live for live reactions.

385
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:07,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just of these awards, but of these trailers, because there's going to be some big things announced.

386
00:30:07,878 --> 00:30:09,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know... Please!

387
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:10,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I need it!

388
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:11,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I need it in my blood!

389
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:17,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, here's the thing, even if you don't get Grand Theft Auto at the Game Awards, you know you're getting it in early December.

390
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,482
[SPEAKER_01]: They did confirm that, so you're gonna get it.

391
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:21,903
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, we're thinking it's gonna be at the Game Awards, so.

392
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it would just make sense.

393
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:24,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, the math is mathing.

394
00:30:24,444 --> 00:30:26,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, stay tuned to our socials.

395
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,166
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll let you know if there's gonna be a live thing.

396
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:35,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to check my schedule at work and make sure, because these, I swear to God, the awards ceremonies start earlier and earlier every stinking year.

397
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:42,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Because don't they do like a pre-show at like 4.30 that leads into the actual show at 5 because it's like three hours long.

398
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also like I'm not gonna lie.

399
00:30:44,484 --> 00:30:46,567
[SPEAKER_01]: What day of the week is December 7th, a Thursday?

400
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually a Thursday is when they do those.

401
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,721
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a Thursday.

402
00:30:50,721 --> 00:31:06,249
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a part of me, y'all, that kind of wants to go like just once, just once, like just do a silly trip, drive to LA at night, go to the Game Awards, drive back the next day, like just do something silly.

403
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not going to lie.

404
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I mean, I know tickets already went on sale, but I don't think we've ever seen that auditorium full.

405
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:15,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're probably still on sale.

406
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:18,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm debating it, y'all.

407
00:31:18,457 --> 00:31:19,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.

408
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:20,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm debating it.

409
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

410
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you know next week.

411
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:24,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make a decision next week.

412
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,164
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

413
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:31,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week, for sure.

414
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:32,891
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, as always, we'll start with you.

415
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,294
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I've been playing, of course, Dead by Daylight.

416
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:40,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing a little bit less.

417
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:46,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just with... My voice is a lot better, but it's still kind of cutting out on me.

418
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:53,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played a crap ton of Disney Dreamlight Valley offline as well as online.

419
00:31:53,186 --> 00:31:56,690
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually just become my go-to for when I need to chill.

420
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:12,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I did another night of Rudra no Hiho, or Legend of the Rudras, or sorry, Treasure of the Rudras, which is the last RPG that Squaresoft produced for the Super Nintendo.

421
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:20,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very good graphically, it does show that this was like the top of what they had learned for 16-bit graphics.

422
00:32:24,518 --> 00:32:32,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I made a character on Baldur's Gate 3, but I don't like how she looks, so I'm going to start over.

423
00:32:32,103 --> 00:32:33,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, that's how I do.

424
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:36,725
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also very Shane of you.

425
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:37,666
[SPEAKER_01]: He does the same thing.

426
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:41,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, but I'm older than Shane, so I was doing it first.

427
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:59,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say though the one thing I don't like it is the same thing I don't like about the first Dragon Age series is that I would rather just have conversations with characters and not have to pick from a list of topics and never hear your character unless they're a party member.

428
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:03,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've never liked that part of it.

429
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

430
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:07,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been just

431
00:33:08,217 --> 00:33:09,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Dabbling in a few other things.

432
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:10,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played some pinball.

433
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:16,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked up a couple of games that I don't remember what they're called, but they're on Mac.

434
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's been kind of my week.

435
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:20,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't been feeling super great.

436
00:33:20,286 --> 00:33:24,830
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just been playing cozy, relaxing things.

437
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,051
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

438
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:26,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, we'll go to you.

439
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:28,473
[SPEAKER_01]: How was your gaming week?

440
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been Minecraft.

441
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:30,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always Minecraft.

442
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:32,276
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this I've

443
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:44,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Got an episode out yesterday, I think, and I've been working on the big build on Razeworks server, so I've been doing that.

444
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:48,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a 60,000 block giant statue thing.

445
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:51,350
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's mostly done.

446
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:57,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I finished up my storage room and the episode for Channel 64.

447
00:33:57,216 --> 00:33:59,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm going to start this week.

448
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:05,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I have time off, I'm going to be sitting down to design the first attraction at the theme park that I'm building.

449
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's designing all the systems for the ride.

450
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:09,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably going to be a log plume ride.

451
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:13,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It's using boats and water streams to push the boats around.

452
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:17,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have to figure out, like, I want to have it where you, like, target shoot stuff.

453
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:23,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of think of, like, the Buzz Lightyear Eye a little bit, you know, something like that.

454
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:31,639
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's designing that and the facade for it and the gates, you know, the entrance for the park and stuff.

455
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of stuff, lots of design stuff.

456
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:40,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to do that, and I've got about three episodes worth of footage for RazeWorks server.

457
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:45,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that once I'm done with this build, I'm thinking about maybe the server.

458
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't decided yet.

459
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:57,542
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really anything for me to do anymore with it, and the grind for this build has been pretty taxing, so I don't know if I'm going to necessarily just stick around to just build farms and stuff.

460
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,460
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

461
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:05,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I could probably do that on Channel 64 instead and that would be a lot more worthwhile for me.

462
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:09,653
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that's what I've been working on.

463
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:09,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

464
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,953
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, my gaming week.

465
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:17,314
[SPEAKER_01]: So in all honesty, like a lot of weeks, it's been a lot of Diablo 4.

466
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:23,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because we're going to get an experience buff for Thanksgiving week, we're getting, what do they call it, the Echoes of Lilith or something like that.

467
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:27,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be like a 35% experience and gold buff throughout Thanksgiving week.

468
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:31,158
[SPEAKER_01]: I will probably finally hit level cap and clear the battle pass this week.

469
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:33,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll finally feel like I can focus on other games too.

470
00:35:34,179 --> 00:36:01,386
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm still enjoying Diablo 4 like my freaking my barrage rogue is very very satisfying I love just spraying monsters down with the you know crossbow it's great so yeah I've been enjoying a lot of that still I have been playing other games too though I've been dabbling a little bit in Overwatch too with a friend of mine playing that I do not like that special mode in the game right now the 3v3 that's like kpop themed which is like getting tickets and all that thing I just

471
00:36:01,906 --> 00:36:18,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, well, look, it's not the aesthetic that I don't care for, that's whatever, I just can't stand the roster of heroes that it's limited to because I like to play support, but my two least favorite support characters, Brigitte and Kiriko, and I know people love Brigitte, okay, I don't.

472
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:19,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I love having her on my team, I don't love playing as her.

473
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:26,220
[SPEAKER_01]: are like the only ones you can pick from and I just and it's just so chaotic.

474
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't love the special mode.

475
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:28,442
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

476
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:41,777
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like telling my friend like can't we just play regular 5v5 so I can be Batiste or Moira or somebody else besides fucking Kuroko who I don't I don't I don't like healing as her so it's just yeah um

477
00:36:42,907 --> 00:36:53,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Also I joined Jamie on one of her streams briefly for like an hour playing Dead by Daylight so that was cute and fun and unexpected so that was my Dead by Daylight playing for the week.

478
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:57,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me talk though about some like gaming related things I kind of did.

479
00:36:57,636 --> 00:37:01,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So number one is I want to plug somebody else and their streams.

480
00:37:01,938 --> 00:37:02,299
[SPEAKER_01]: TaleOfD20s

481
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,702
[SPEAKER_01]: He asked me if I would do a tabletop RPG.

482
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:43,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they asked me to play a game called Masks, which is basically like teenage superheroes.

483
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to like create our superhero.

484
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:45,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

485
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've committed to the whole thing.

486
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And I created a character.

487
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:53,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to know more about it, you're just going to have to go check it out.

488
00:37:53,362 --> 00:38:00,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will post the link to the archive video in our chat if you want to bookmark that and check it out later.

489
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:03,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also just urge you to check out A Tale of D20s here on Twitch.

490
00:38:03,965 --> 00:38:04,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a follow.

491
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Show some love.

492
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:10,490
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a lot of other campaigns that I'm not in that are going on that are a lot of fun.

493
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,211
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I had fun with it.

494
00:38:11,211 --> 00:38:15,375
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say that because I don't do tabletop a lot.

495
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:19,139
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first time I've done a tabletop game in a very long time.

496
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:26,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little nervous going into it because I'm like, I'm not worried about any of the people, but I'm worried about it being broadcast live on the internet when I don't know what I'm doing.

497
00:38:26,747 --> 00:38:40,815
[SPEAKER_01]: But the GM did great and created a very welcoming and safe environment and all the other players were super cool and we had a fun time.

498
00:38:40,815 --> 00:38:43,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to give a shout out to them and thank them for having me.

499
00:38:43,617 --> 00:38:46,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be back next week for the conclusion of the story.

500
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:47,699
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a two episode commitment.

501
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,781
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did this week and we're going to do one next Sunday.

502
00:38:50,621 --> 00:39:05,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, outside of that, I want to briefly mention this because in the gaming world, and Loki, you referenced this earlier, it's not directly about a video game, but a lot of people are very curious about this Scott Pilgrim show that just showed up on Netflix.

503
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:08,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not Scott Pilgrim versus the world.

504
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:12,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is actually Scott Pilgrim, uh, what did they

505
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:14,750
[SPEAKER_01]: What did they actually call this?

506
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name all of a sudden.

507
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:17,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

508
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:18,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.

509
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:19,320
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the name of it.

510
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:23,018
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the show that they have.

511
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:24,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are saying it's an anime.

512
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:28,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was actually animated overseas or what, but whatever.

513
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,020
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that style.

514
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:35,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very influenced by that because, you know, it originally was a manga.

515
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:38,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't watch a lot of TV.

516
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:41,086
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know this, but my friend kind of wanted to watch it.

517
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:43,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right, let's watch it.

518
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:46,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first episode was kind of doing its thing.

519
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:47,549
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, OK, OK.

520
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the first episode, we were like,

521
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:51,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, wait.

522
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:52,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we gotta watch more.

523
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:53,516
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta watch more.

524
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ended up watching five episodes.

525
00:39:55,578 --> 00:40:02,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, we would have binged the whole thing if it wasn't like, it's like 1230, and if I don't drive home now, I'm gonna fall asleep.

526
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:06,987
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so we just agreed like, okay, we'll get back together and binge the other three episodes later.

527
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,949
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm actually finding I'm really enjoying it.

528
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:12,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to talk too much about it because it could get spoilery.

529
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:15,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to do that and ruin it for people that haven't seen it.

530
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:20,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will just say I've been pleasantly surprised with some of the creative directions they've been taking with it.

531
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am I guess this is really polarizing people.

532
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,443
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do not like it.

533
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:28,846
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think it's I think it's fucking fucking clever.

534
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's extremely fucking clever.

535
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:34,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the movie or read the book first.

536
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I thought, I think it's neat.

537
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,421
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to tell.

538
00:41:00,421 --> 00:41:02,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised they got all the voices to come back.

539
00:41:02,941 --> 00:41:03,761
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in it.

540
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, that was really cool.

541
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:08,042
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell some of them are older, but that's okay.

542
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:09,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still fun.

543
00:41:09,482 --> 00:41:10,742
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

544
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:11,923
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

545
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with that being said, that was it for my gaming week.

546
00:41:14,203 --> 00:41:19,304
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give a positive reaction to that because I so rarely actually sit down and watch movies or TV.

547
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:24,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought you all would be proud of me that I actually watched not just one episode, but five episodes of Scott Pilgrim takes off.

548
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:24,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

549
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:26,866
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

550
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:28,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's move on.

551
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:29,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what is going on.

552
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have kind of a lighter news week this week.

553
00:41:31,669 --> 00:41:37,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this week, you know, we're going into the end of the year, less games coming out.

554
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:41,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I am disappointed in myself that I did not play Super Mario RPG.

555
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:47,721
[SPEAKER_01]: However, my husband just got back from Costco and here's my four, there's no codes on this.

556
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:48,642
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in the back.

557
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's my four $25 Nintendo eShop cards.

558
00:41:53,948 --> 00:41:57,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get another voucher and buy myself Super Mario RPG.

559
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be happening soon.

560
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:02,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and.

561
00:42:02,713 --> 00:42:05,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a set of PlayStation cards too.

562
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:11,219
[SPEAKER_01]: For when, for when PlayStation Plus goes on sale, inevitably on Black Friday, or I think it might already be.

563
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:19,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to load up on that as well and not, not feel bad about how much I'm paying for it because I at least got a discount from getting a hundred dollars worth of cards for 90 bucks.

564
00:42:19,744 --> 00:42:22,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my Thanksgiving gift to myself.

565
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:25,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into gaming news, Loki.

566
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:37,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, the Embracer Group has basically laid off 900 employees in just this quarter.

567
00:42:37,273 --> 00:42:54,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So, according to the most recent sales report from the Crystal Dynamics and, or from the Embracer Group, they said that the company has experienced a 13% increase in net sales between July and September, so for quarter two of their fiscal year.

568
00:42:55,282 --> 00:43:04,345
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of that though, they said that around 900 people were laid off as part of reduction in headcount.

569
00:43:04,345 --> 00:43:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: That equates to 5% of their whole workforce.

570
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:12,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that's because they're purchasing a bunch of companies and redundancy and whatnot.

571
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:21,731
[SPEAKER_04]: They said they've also reduced the number of projects being worked on and focusing on improving the projected return on investment with PC and console.

572
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:33,644
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that they would like to put it on the record that special thanks to the people that have left Embracer in the quarter.

573
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,104
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't really say much other than, you know, what they're doing with their employees.

574
00:43:37,104 --> 00:43:37,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

575
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:40,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like how Embracer is kind of buying up all these companies.

576
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:43,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels to me like EA.

577
00:43:43,326 --> 00:43:49,027
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how we had like a lot of great studios and then EA came in and gutted them all.

578
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:49,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

579
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:50,968
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like EA 2.0 again.

580
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:52,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.

581
00:43:52,613 --> 00:44:01,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, obviously Embracer Group, I think, was setting up for these much larger aspirations, which, you know, if rumors are to be believed, was some sort of Saudi Arabia deal or something.

582
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:03,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

583
00:44:03,355 --> 00:44:05,015
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that didn't happen.

584
00:44:05,015 --> 00:44:11,396
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like now all these companies that they bought are having to pay the price of what was a really bad business decision in many ways.

585
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:18,158
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's so it just sucks to see that the people responsible for that sort of decision.

586
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the CEOs.

587
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:19,658
[SPEAKER_03]: That's

588
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,491
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's gross.

589
00:44:23,491 --> 00:44:32,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing that I just, as much as we should be celebrating all the great games that came out this year, it's this type of news that just leaves the most stank in the room.

590
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:39,400
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's not just Embracer, every fucking week on this show, every fucking week for the last six months.

591
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,024
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some layoff that's happening and it's it's sad.

592
00:44:44,024 --> 00:44:45,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's what?

593
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:46,847
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it's 900 here.

594
00:44:46,847 --> 00:44:49,270
[SPEAKER_01]: But how many hundred was it last week?

595
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,353
[SPEAKER_01]: How many how many hundred was it when we were talking about Bungie?

596
00:44:52,353 --> 00:44:53,835
[SPEAKER_01]: How many hundred was it like?

597
00:44:55,434 --> 00:45:14,501
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about thousands of people in this industry have lost their job in 2023 and that sucks because usually this industry is very good at taking care of each other and filling in other positions and hiring people where everybody says, how are you going to take care of thousands of people?

598
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:16,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not every story here is going to have a happy ending.

599
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:18,262
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.

600
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,503
[SPEAKER_01]: The CEOs are fine.

601
00:45:20,866 --> 00:45:23,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, of course, you know, can't punish them.

602
00:45:23,108 --> 00:45:25,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, except for one who's leaving on Jan.

603
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, you know what?

604
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,752
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't even I can't even say that tongue in cheek.

605
00:45:28,752 --> 00:45:30,033
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting a golden parachute.

606
00:45:30,033 --> 00:45:30,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck him.

607
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:34,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't even I can't even say something sassy about it.

608
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:37,358
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks, too.

609
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:40,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, John Riccitello left, so I guess there's that.

610
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,181
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hardly anything.

611
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:43,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I get one.

612
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not counting Bobby Kotick gone until he's actually gone.

613
00:45:58,379 --> 00:45:59,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's that.

614
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the fact it's a golden parachute.

615
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:08,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So does the does it even really know for the for intensive wanting to see CEOs bear the brunt of these bad decisions?

616
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:09,146
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it doesn't.

617
00:46:09,146 --> 00:46:12,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't actually make me feel better at all what's happening to Bobby Kotick.

618
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:17,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yes, I'm glad he will no longer be in the industry, if all goes the way it should go.

619
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:26,558
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm it doesn't offset all this, all this other terrible crap from other CEOs and bad decisions and other, you know, high level bad business decisions.

620
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:42,743
[SPEAKER_01]: that are causing the money to just hemorrhage so bad, they have to decide, Welp, guess we just can't have this studio make this game anymore, or Welp, guess we have to tell this studio that we're putting their game out at the end of the year, whether it's done or not, Kong.

621
00:46:42,743 --> 00:46:43,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Like...

622
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:50,474
[SPEAKER_04]: or even, like, it's not just calling even, like, was it the recent Walking Dead game was also terrible too.

623
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:58,379
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of games that are just not good that are being put out because they're being rushed by these publishers.

624
00:46:58,379 --> 00:47:06,283
[SPEAKER_04]: GameMill, though, is its own thing, because GameMill's always been a shovelware company, so that's not... I'm surprised that people are just picking up on that now.

625
00:47:06,283 --> 00:47:12,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, they've been like that for... I mean, when I was selling VO games, like...

626
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:14,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair.

627
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:20,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, SJ in our chat says, I wonder and hope Jeff will open the show referencing these layoffs.

628
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:28,296
[SPEAKER_01]: He of course won't attack these companies, but I hope he dedicates these awards to those folks who sacrifice their time on these games only to get laid off.

629
00:47:28,296 --> 00:47:37,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see that too, but knowing that there is such a huge financial contribution that does end up coming from these same companies, unfortunately, not bloody likely.

630
00:47:38,584 --> 00:47:42,787
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe there is a way he could wordsmith it.

631
00:47:42,787 --> 00:47:50,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I like your idea of dedicating the awards to the folks that made them, whether they're still in the industry or not.

632
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:55,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is a very clever way you could word that and get away with it.

633
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:59,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we will be lucky if we get a tweet, unfortunately.

634
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:04,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from Jeff Keighley, I think you'll be lucky if you get a tweet on that.

635
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:06,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

636
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to see that too.

637
00:48:07,244 --> 00:48:07,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.

638
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:34,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Questbuster in chat says Embracer was so aggressive in expanding over the last three years, borrowing, leveraging, and spending billions to rapidly build an empire, almost without regard for potential bumps in the road ahead from the high-profile failure of titles like Saints Row to the Saudi deal collapse.

639
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,453
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's going to pay for that?

640
00:48:38,424 --> 00:48:40,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we have, can I get on my soapbox for a minute?

641
00:48:40,726 --> 00:48:42,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I rant about the person I ranted to?

642
00:48:42,227 --> 00:48:43,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Soapbox away.

643
00:48:43,028 --> 00:48:43,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

644
00:48:43,528 --> 00:48:47,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I rant about the person I ran a lot about on this show?

645
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:48,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Motherfucking Elon Musk.

646
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:49,393
[SPEAKER_01]: My God.

647
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,534
[SPEAKER_01]: How?

648
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:51,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Motherfucker.

649
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:57,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many things I could say about him.

650
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me started.

651
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

652
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:02,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But can we just for a minute look at the fact

653
00:49:03,154 --> 00:49:13,237
[SPEAKER_01]: He paid $44 billion for a company that is very clearly, by his own hand, way less than half that value now.

654
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:18,119
[SPEAKER_01]: If even that, I can't even believe that company's worth $1 billion at this point, to be quite honest.

655
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:29,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to see an external audit tell us what that company's really fucking worth, because I would bet it's worth pennies on the dollar for what he paid for it, by his own hand.

656
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:31,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.

657
00:49:31,208 --> 00:49:34,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And you like this is especially with him.

658
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:40,155
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a situation where you can say this wasn't the temperature in the room.

659
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:43,418
[SPEAKER_01]: This wasn't the industry moving in the other direction.

660
00:49:43,418 --> 00:49:52,585
[SPEAKER_01]: This was literally your stupid fucking ass and your big fucking mouth that doesn't know how to shut.

661
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:55,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And I boldly underline this the fuck up.

662
00:49:57,276 --> 00:50:04,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Elon Musk has no one to blame for what has happened over on Shitter except for himself.

663
00:50:04,281 --> 00:50:06,363
[SPEAKER_01]: No one.

664
00:50:06,363 --> 00:50:18,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's gonna pay for that money that he literally flushed down the fucking toilet that he brought through the front door the day he started at Twitter?

665
00:50:18,632 --> 00:50:19,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's gonna pay for that?

666
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:30,937
[SPEAKER_01]: because people like that motherfucker never do it, never pay a dime out of his own pocket, never have to feel any burn or anything for anything.

667
00:50:30,937 --> 00:50:38,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of burn, while he's flushing Twitter down the shithole, he blew up a fucking rocket this weekend.

668
00:50:38,262 --> 00:50:40,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God no people were on it.

669
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,780
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is a fucking moron.

670
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.

671
00:50:45,102 --> 00:50:46,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stand him.

672
00:50:46,963 --> 00:50:58,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't stand the fact that he's not being held accountable for literally actively making the world a worse place.

673
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:01,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate him!

674
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:07,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me started on his anti-semitism.

675
00:51:07,653 --> 00:51:11,877
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk about the by his own hand, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

676
00:51:12,847 --> 00:51:19,871
[SPEAKER_01]: TigerClaw says this is the guy who wants to send people to Mars, and he also wants to implant chips in people's brain.

677
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:24,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you agree to do this stuff, I'm sorry, not sorry.

678
00:51:24,573 --> 00:51:32,618
[SPEAKER_01]: You deserve the big misfortune that's coming your way if you are dumb enough to buy what this guy is selling at this point.

679
00:51:33,948 --> 00:51:35,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with SSJ100 Matt.

680
00:51:35,689 --> 00:51:36,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Send people to Mars.

681
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,191
[SPEAKER_01]: You first, sir.

682
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:39,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

683
00:51:39,952 --> 00:51:46,775
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is something we need so badly, by all means, Elon, after you.

684
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:53,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off my planet, because you're not making this one a better place.

685
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:54,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel better.

686
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel better?

687
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel better.

688
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:59,363
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

689
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:01,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, what should we talk about next?

690
00:52:01,444 --> 00:52:02,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's talk about

691
00:52:04,005 --> 00:52:05,026
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation Portal.

692
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:07,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's a video game podcast, isn't it?

693
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:10,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the PlayStation Portal.

694
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:16,694
[SPEAKER_01]: The PlayStation Portal was a new peripheral that just came out this Wednesday.

695
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:20,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were kind of saying, why couldn't you have just made a new Vita, yo?

696
00:52:20,276 --> 00:52:23,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this device is meant for remote streaming.

697
00:52:23,498 --> 00:52:26,080
[SPEAKER_01]: But people are interested in this.

698
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,062
[SPEAKER_01]: And who bought this new device that just came out on Wednesday?

699
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:34,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Scalpers, scalpers, scalpers, scalpers, because the world sucks.

700
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:38,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And scalpers have been getting their hands on the player.

701
00:52:38,986 --> 00:52:47,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And this portal will cost, I'm getting this from the outlet Eurogamer, who says that the price over there is 199 euros.

702
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:54,392
[SPEAKER_01]: But eBay, of course, is putting listings over 300 euros, because again, scalpers.

703
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:56,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a shitty, I should,

704
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:01,718
[SPEAKER_01]: People turn to scalping sometimes.

705
00:53:01,718 --> 00:53:04,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing.

706
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:15,865
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that turn to scalping are the people that are getting laid off because Elon Musk is a twat and all these other people that are in the industry that are making bad decisions.

707
00:53:15,865 --> 00:53:21,488
[SPEAKER_01]: These people turn to scalping because they feel they have no other choice to make money and put food in people's mouths.

708
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:23,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very careful how much I do.

709
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:24,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like scalpers.

710
00:53:24,749 --> 00:53:25,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like this whole thing.

711
00:53:26,752 --> 00:53:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also kind of recognize the real problem is the people who create the demand for it, who ultimately in turn end up being the rich motherfuckers that have this type of dispensable income to be able to pay for it.

712
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:41,816
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that buy this stuff are the real problem.

713
00:53:43,198 --> 00:53:48,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and if you've ever bought a Scout product, I'm sorry, yes, I'm talking about you.

714
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:52,944
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you'll make a better decision next time and think about some of these things that I'm saying.

715
00:53:52,944 --> 00:53:57,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, um, there's a ton of people that are on eBay selling this.

716
00:53:57,507 --> 00:54:00,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I again, I'm not sure I didn't think the demand would be there for this.

717
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm surprised that they're not just stuck with this stuff.

718
00:54:04,892 --> 00:54:10,319
[SPEAKER_01]: The reviews for this are mixed, saying that the hardware is pretty good, but what, what, basically what's the point?

719
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,041
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very limited type of appeal.

720
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,404
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an actual PlayStation handheld.

721
00:54:14,404 --> 00:54:20,252
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another screen for your PS5 on hopefully strong internet.

722
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:35,419
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, if you can fucking hold off just a little bit longer, the PlayStation Direct store, at least in the UK, and I'm pretty sure it's a similar situation in the US, is saying, we're working hard to make more stock available.

723
00:54:35,419 --> 00:54:38,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Please check back on Wednesday, 22nd of November.

724
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,062
[SPEAKER_01]: The US version of the page is saying early December.

725
00:54:42,062 --> 00:54:46,024
[SPEAKER_01]: So there does appear to still be chances to get this before Christmas.

726
00:54:46,024 --> 00:55:02,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything else, I will try to say for those folks that are tempted for whatever reason to support scalping and buy one of these, I applaud Sony for at least going as far to say, if you can wait a little longer, you could probably still get one before Christmas.

727
00:55:02,274 --> 00:55:04,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do like that they're

728
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:10,368
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to, you know, get people to not give in to the scalpers.

729
00:55:10,368 --> 00:55:12,230
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope, I hope it does work out.

730
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:18,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I have no interest in the PlayStation Portal at all.

731
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:22,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm disappointed they give it zero functionality outside of what it does with the PS5.

732
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why couldn't it at least be a fucking Vita on top?

733
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:26,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

734
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:54,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just gonna be e-waste here very soon because it's only gonna function for the PlayStation 5 and it doesn't work great all the time in the preferred environment which is like I guess on your own Wi-Fi like if you're planning on taking this remotely like to a hotel or somewhere and play your PlayStation 5 games good luck with that because it's not gonna be a good experience.

735
00:55:55,006 --> 00:56:00,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're playing a point and click adventure or something that can move slowly with delay like that, you know?

736
00:56:00,572 --> 00:56:01,453
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point then?

737
00:56:01,453 --> 00:56:07,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know, like, how many point and click adventure games does PlayStation 5 have?

738
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:09,161
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

739
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:10,843
[SPEAKER_01]: You think of action and things like that.

740
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:13,286
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

741
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:14,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, um, let's move on.

742
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:15,929
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

743
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:28,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, there's a little thing that happened with, uh, the skins in Fortnite that has people feeling a little bit less than happy.

744
00:56:28,153 --> 00:56:37,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So, without really any announcement about it, uh, people found that there were skins that they had paid for that they can no longer use in-game.

745
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:42,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And specifically what it is, is that there are items that were

746
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,121
[SPEAKER_08]: rated 12+.

747
00:56:46,121 --> 00:56:56,307
[SPEAKER_08]: So according to Epic, about 7% of the Fortnite skins can only be equipped in islands that are rated as teen level islands.

748
00:56:56,307 --> 00:57:04,751
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some people who most of the skins they have are those restricted items.

749
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:11,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Although funny enough, one person posted a screenshot showing that all of the skins except Michael Myers

750
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:19,453
[SPEAKER_08]: were age restricted only because Mikey doesn't have his knife.

751
00:57:19,453 --> 00:57:20,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

752
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:22,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what?

753
00:57:22,415 --> 00:57:29,439
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like the most violent character out there.

754
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:41,285
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is some thought that Epic's going to go in and do versions that are teen safe by their standards that you can then use, but there's no confirmation about it.

755
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:53,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Epic says that it's working on something like that, but the confirmation isn't necessarily that it's happened, or that they have any kind of time frame on that.

756
00:57:53,661 --> 00:58:00,747
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, it's a game where you hunt people.

757
00:58:00,747 --> 00:58:04,451
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be a teen plus game.

758
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:10,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean... I thought Fortnite was rated teen.

759
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:12,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It is rated teen according to their website.

760
00:58:12,216 --> 00:58:15,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would any of the skins not... Like, that doesn't make any sense.

761
00:58:15,877 --> 00:58:21,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, maybe they're trying to change it to where they can make it kid-friendly.

762
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:22,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

763
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:24,142
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do that at this point.

764
00:58:24,142 --> 00:58:25,022
[SPEAKER_08]: This is ridiculous.

765
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:26,363
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't re-rate it.

766
00:58:26,363 --> 00:58:27,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It won't work like that.

767
00:58:27,624 --> 00:58:28,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe, I don't know.

768
00:58:28,244 --> 00:58:33,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're announcing this business... They're announcing that they did it after they did the thing.

769
00:58:35,507 --> 00:58:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't understand the logic.

770
00:58:41,293 --> 00:58:50,681
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be some business suit person that made the decision, because we all know what happens when you get into high upper management, I guess.

771
00:58:52,711 --> 00:58:58,212
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

772
00:58:58,212 --> 00:59:15,057
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like a point where you get away from quote the people in the trenches and lose that connection to what's actually going on or people who don't really even understand the game itself who are trying to make decisions about it.

773
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:15,977
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that.

774
00:59:15,977 --> 00:59:21,179
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the line where the gamers stop and the businessmen begin.

775
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:22,519
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.

776
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:23,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Business people.

777
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:25,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

778
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

779
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:30,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Business humans.

780
00:59:30,861 --> 00:59:33,802
[SPEAKER_08]: But at any rate, it's ridiculous.

781
00:59:33,802 --> 00:59:35,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm kind of glad I don't play Fortnite.

782
00:59:37,952 --> 00:59:40,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime I've ever played, it's only as Ariana Grande anyway.

783
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,294
[SPEAKER_01]: So who I imagine is E for everyone.

784
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:45,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever.

785
00:59:45,175 --> 01:00:03,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm pretty sure, though, that they got the whole deal of Myers winning around with his keyboard, you know, pretending to be John Carpenter was taken directly from the Samination parodies of Dead by Daylight, where John Carpenter follows him around playing his theme.

786
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:05,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

787
01:00:05,671 --> 01:00:14,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not realize he didn't have his knife in that game, which is so funny to me because he should have his knife because you run around collecting fucking guns in the manga.

788
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,802
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do realize there is a creative mode in the game, too.

789
01:00:18,802 --> 01:00:20,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like this is where this is all.

790
01:00:20,744 --> 01:00:22,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's not like Battle Royale or whatever.

791
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:24,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It is happening in creative.

792
01:00:24,167 --> 01:00:26,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's that it's the creative.

793
01:00:26,048 --> 01:00:27,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I get it.

794
01:00:27,149 --> 01:00:28,751
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the the

795
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:32,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortnite, Roblox section of the game.

796
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.

797
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:11,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently there's, you know, the whole Epic versus Google thing is actually now in court, their legal showdown.

798
01:01:11,596 --> 01:01:16,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're getting updates around this that sound kind of crazy.

799
01:01:16,459 --> 01:01:26,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So first off, it's been noted that Google hasn't really been keeping all the evidence that they are supposed to be retaining all the documents.

800
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:26,504
[SPEAKER_04]: That says,

801
01:01:27,907 --> 01:01:34,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic was allowed to tell the jury that Google may have destroyed or hidden relevant evidence.

802
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:54,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic's lawyers, they brought up how few Google chat logs have been provided during discovery and even said that Google execs had possibly deleted chats and jokes about hiding conversations.

803
01:01:57,248 --> 01:02:13,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Also saying that there was a Google Information Governance lead, Gennaro Lopez, who was questioned multiple times about seemingly missing chat logs and the company's policy of telling employees to chat off the record about sensitive issues.

804
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:18,296
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that doesn't sound legally dubious or anything.

805
01:02:18,296 --> 01:02:18,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course not.

806
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,759
[SPEAKER_04]: and also said, you know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

807
01:02:23,759 --> 01:02:33,728
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ has like the comment of the night here in chat saying Google had their documents, but they canceled it after a few years of support.

808
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:34,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

809
01:02:34,348 --> 01:02:34,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

810
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:35,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

811
01:02:35,149 --> 01:02:37,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We stored all of our documents on.

812
01:02:37,611 --> 01:02:43,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it on one plus or Google plus G plus or Google Google Wave?

813
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:44,917
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all Google Wave documents.

814
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:45,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

815
01:02:45,278 --> 01:02:45,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

816
01:02:45,758 --> 01:02:46,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

817
01:02:48,787 --> 01:02:55,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it says you cannot guarantee the documents that were destroyed will contradict the testimony we're going to hear.

818
01:02:55,651 --> 01:03:04,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says also during this case, you had the default setting to delete chats every 24 hours, correct?

819
01:03:04,777 --> 01:03:10,601
[SPEAKER_04]: When they were questioning the vice president of apps and games.

820
01:03:12,904 --> 01:03:19,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, yeah, and then going back to that Google CEO wasn't saving evidence as well.

821
01:03:19,126 --> 01:03:25,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to that whole auto delete thing as well.

822
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:27,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's drama.

823
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:32,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'd be interesting to see how that plays out, if that hurts Google in any way about this.

824
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:34,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

825
01:03:34,691 --> 01:03:34,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh.

826
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:37,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Naughty Dog

827
01:03:53,633 --> 01:04:02,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Naughty Dog is the studio that's brought us a lot of great hits, including The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II.

828
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:10,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was announced that a remastered version of The Last of Us Part II is coming to the PlayStation 5 this January.

829
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:26,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately it was a leaked trailer that showed up that had to be confirmed by Sony so who knows if maybe they were trying to save this for a certain first week in December award show that was scheduled to show some trailers, but they had to confirm ahead of that.

830
01:04:27,052 --> 01:04:30,015
[SPEAKER_01]: January 19, 2024, with improved loading times, PS5, 4K graphics, and integration with the PS5's new DualSense controller.

831
01:04:43,826 --> 01:04:48,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so all those things are going to be things that are in the game.

832
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:57,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Also new in the game, No Return, a brand new roguelike mode, which allows you to choose your path through a series of randomized encounters.

833
01:04:57,538 --> 01:05:02,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can play as unlockable characters that have not been seen before in the franchise.

834
01:05:02,783 --> 01:05:06,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking like Crash Bandicoot?

835
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:09,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be so jarring, and I would love that.

836
01:05:10,467 --> 01:05:11,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.

837
01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:15,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you're going to go outside the franchise, make it funny.

838
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:20,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if it's Naughty Dog, then that would have to be, what was it, Ratchet and Clank or something like that?

839
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:22,152
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it'd be fucking Nathan Drake or something.

840
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not- Ow, boo.

841
01:05:23,993 --> 01:05:25,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.

842
01:05:25,294 --> 01:05:25,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

843
01:05:25,794 --> 01:05:29,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Other Last of Us characters that you can't- Well, I guess they say outside the franchise.

844
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:29,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

845
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:34,158
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to compete in a global leaderboard.

846
01:05:34,158 --> 01:05:44,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the remastered version brings early versions of three levels that were not in the original game, and commentary, which I forget is a thing a lot of games do these days.

847
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:56,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Director Neil Druckmann, narrative lead Hallie Gross, and actors Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson, and Laura Bailey will provide commentary throughout the game.

848
01:05:56,528 --> 01:05:58,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also the most

849
01:05:58,809 --> 01:06:08,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasant surprise about this is that if you own the game on a prior platform, you can upgrade for $10.

850
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:15,052
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was like, oh, I thought this was going to be an excuse to charge $70 for the same game, which we know other studios do.

851
01:06:15,052 --> 01:06:20,693
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, yeah, you'll be able to buy an upgrade version for just $10.

852
01:06:20,693 --> 01:06:21,833
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to at this point.

853
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:25,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it makes sense, because like, if you think about it, they just released The Last of Us 2.

854
01:06:25,574 --> 01:06:27,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are you possibly like updating?

855
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:28,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

856
01:06:28,334 --> 01:06:28,914
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSouls3 Elden Ring

857
01:06:43,194 --> 01:06:44,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You just released this.

858
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:44,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

859
01:06:44,915 --> 01:06:48,558
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a very important asterisk with that.

860
01:06:48,558 --> 01:06:52,802
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to make sure this is clear from the official PlayStation blog.

861
01:06:52,802 --> 01:06:57,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And good news for existing owners of The Last of Us Part 2 on PlayStation 4.

862
01:06:57,325 --> 01:07:03,170
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be able to upgrade to a digital version of The Last of Us Part 2 for just $10 at launch.

863
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:07,133
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also be able to import your saves in the original game to the Part 2 remastered.

864
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:07,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry.

865
01:07:07,553 --> 01:07:10,336
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first read that, I thought they were saying you had to have a digital version

866
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:10,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm

867
01:07:33,118 --> 01:07:36,240
[SPEAKER_04]: E3VL asks a good question in chat going why not call it DLC instead of remaster?

868
01:08:03,518 --> 01:08:21,070
[SPEAKER_01]: More people are getting exposed to The Last of Us thanks to the HBO series, and specifically, it will be part two when that next season inevitably shows up, which they haven't even started filming yet, because there's been a lot of chat about who's going to play Abby, but they haven't officially announced that yet.

869
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:29,536
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think because the hype is going to be building around season two, there are going to be people that want to, now that the actor strike is resolved, they can have those conversations.

870
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:41,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be a lot of people that want to play the second game who maybe got exposed to The Last of Us through the series and maybe are now revisiting it now.

871
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:44,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike Deaf says, I thought they did announce who would play Abby.

872
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:55,599
[SPEAKER_01]: There are strong rumors and there are articles going around about who is being talked to, but they have not confirmed Abby's role as of yet.

873
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:55,740
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

874
01:08:56,448 --> 01:09:04,798
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently it is somebody who originally auditioned for L in the game, so... Interesting.

875
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:07,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on.

876
01:09:07,902 --> 01:09:11,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Next story.

877
01:09:11,926 --> 01:09:12,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is from DarkSakura.

878
01:09:14,978 --> 01:09:31,127
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a big accusation against SEGA about threatening to lay off a good portion of the unionized workforce as a retaliatory action.

879
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:41,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So, basically, on November 6th, SEGA put out a proposal to, quote, phase out all temporary workers by February 2024.

880
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:54,050
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people who were in QA and localization, and they sent this to the Allied Employees Guild Improving SEGA, or AEGIS.

881
01:09:55,651 --> 01:10:04,263
[SPEAKER_08]: The union represents over 200 employees across marketing, sales, product development, and other departments.

882
01:10:04,263 --> 01:10:09,651
[SPEAKER_08]: The layoffs would impact about 40% of the group or about 80 unionized employees total.

883
01:10:11,953 --> 01:10:34,725
[SPEAKER_08]: And instead of bargaining with the union, Sega just delivered the news directly to employees in a meeting, and also violated rules against negotiating directly with those employees instead of with their union.

884
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:44,650
[SPEAKER_08]: SEGA, of course, hasn't replied to any requests for comment.

885
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:51,952
[SPEAKER_08]: As stated by Elise Willeker, who's a senior QA tester, I'm going to read the quote.

886
01:10:51,952 --> 01:11:02,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It's disheartening to see such actions from SEGA, as it is unmistakably demonstrates bad faith bargaining and refusal to recognize the valuable contributions of a significant portion of our colleagues.

887
01:11:03,294 --> 01:11:14,958
[SPEAKER_08]: We have filed an unfair labor practice charge to call out SEGA's direct dealing with members and its breaching of the status quo by telling bargaining unit members that our jobs would be ending shortly.

888
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:24,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So, of course, it's gone to the National Labor Relations Board for review, but it may not be resolved in time to prevent the layoffs.

889
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:25,481
[SPEAKER_08]: But

890
01:11:29,061 --> 01:11:31,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that they nail them for this.

891
01:11:31,302 --> 01:11:36,045
[SPEAKER_08]: It really makes me very disappointed in SEGA.

892
01:11:36,045 --> 01:11:49,391
[SPEAKER_08]: It really makes me not want to buy any of their products until they, you know, recognize the authority of the union.

893
01:11:51,192 --> 01:11:54,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the wave of the unionizing is coming.

894
01:11:54,214 --> 01:12:02,320
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not surprised to see a game company allegedly pushing back, you know, in the same type of in this strong type of way, but they're not going to win.

895
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,061
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to win the war.

896
01:12:04,061 --> 01:12:09,385
[SPEAKER_01]: They might see this as a winning the battle, especially if, you know, they can't reverse this by the time people actually get laid off.

897
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:11,046
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not going to win the war.

898
01:12:11,046 --> 01:12:17,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think companies need to figure out how to welcome this culture because it's not going away.

899
01:12:19,972 --> 01:12:26,017
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like DarkSakura is expressing with her feelings, it's just going to put more people off.

900
01:12:26,017 --> 01:12:28,079
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a good thing.

901
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:29,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

902
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,621
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

903
01:12:30,621 --> 01:12:31,842
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of SEGA.

904
01:12:33,157 --> 01:12:43,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so there was all those rumors that, you know, a member of Microsoft and I think even other companies were looking to purchase SEGA, but didn't end up going through with that, obviously.

905
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:56,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's finally, we finally got a comment from SEGA regarding it, from the CEO saying that they are honored that so many companies were interested in purchasing SEGA, but SEGA is not for sale.

906
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Many companies are interested.

907
01:12:58,322 --> 01:12:59,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We feel honored.

908
01:12:59,342 --> 01:13:02,184
[SPEAKER_04]: We have attractive IPs and potentials.

909
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:03,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Companies owned by the owner.

910
01:13:03,866 --> 01:13:05,927
[SPEAKER_04]: A strong owner.

911
01:13:05,927 --> 01:13:11,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that kind of transaction is going to happen, according to Yatsumi.

912
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:33,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know, they talked about growing, that they're pursuing different categories, like, of course, Roblox, because they have the Sonic speed simulator there and their movies, which have been wildly successful, thanks to, you know, some redesigns of the main character.

913
01:13:33,384 --> 01:13:41,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, they have their TV series coming, too, because Knuckles has this TV series pretty soon.

914
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it's

915
01:13:43,592 --> 01:13:51,558
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting to see where they go, but they're not going to be owned by Microsoft anytime soon.

916
01:13:51,558 --> 01:13:52,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Or anyone, for that matter.

917
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:54,219
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to... Yeah, or anyone.

918
01:13:54,219 --> 01:14:02,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably after that last story, nobody wants to touch them right now anyway, so... Well, yeah, makes them less attractive, for sure.

919
01:14:02,265 --> 01:14:04,687
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

920
01:14:04,687 --> 01:14:10,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, lastly, here, before we get to some of our regular segments, you know, and talking about things that are not so attractive,

921
01:14:11,391 --> 01:14:17,055
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about AI-generated content and how it is starting to spread more and more on YouTube.

922
01:14:17,055 --> 01:14:25,741
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube has now made a requirement per a blog post made by Product Management Vice President Jennifer Flannery O'Connor and Emily Moxley.

923
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:26,802
[SPEAKER_01]: They are both vice presidents.

924
01:14:27,662 --> 01:14:41,626
[SPEAKER_01]: They talked about this in a blog post on November 14th, stating that any video that contains AI-generated content requires disclosure and content labels in the video description that make it clear that aspects of the video were generated by AI.

925
01:14:41,626 --> 01:14:44,907
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, events that never happened.

926
01:14:44,907 --> 01:14:49,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Deepfakes showing an individual that's doing something they didn't actually do.

927
01:14:49,008 --> 01:14:53,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good, but the question is, how are they going to enforce this?

928
01:14:54,554 --> 01:14:55,854
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they going to enforce this?

929
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,903
[SPEAKER_01]: air on the side of, you know, like where anybody could say, oh, this is made by AI.

930
01:15:18,903 --> 01:15:24,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the thing gets shut down because somebody reported it, even if it was legit and not the result of AI.

931
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,568
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know.

932
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:34,474
[SPEAKER_01]: But YouTube is rolling out community guidelines that allow if you are affected by AI generated content, you can request that a video is removed.

933
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:42,079
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if somebody were to make a video of me saying something hideous that I never said, I could make that request to YouTube, take it down.

934
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:57,888
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube is also doing this for like musicians whose voices is being mimicked by AI software, which I think is very interesting because that's a very big trend on YouTube right now is these softwares of creators.

935
01:15:57,888 --> 01:15:58,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

936
01:15:58,048 --> 01:15:58,589
[SPEAKER_01]: And that whole thing.

937
01:15:58,589 --> 01:15:59,629
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

938
01:15:59,629 --> 01:16:02,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, are you going to what about the other part of that?

939
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:04,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard about that one?

940
01:16:04,152 --> 01:16:05,493
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

941
01:16:05,493 --> 01:16:05,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

942
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:09,865
[SPEAKER_04]: They are allowing them to crack down on it.

943
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:15,207
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there's also a part of Google's AI thing.

944
01:16:15,207 --> 01:16:19,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Certain artists have signed up to allow their voice to be used for different things.

945
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:27,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could, you could prompt it to generate like something for you and use that in your YouTube shorts.

946
01:16:27,714 --> 01:16:28,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.

947
01:16:28,294 --> 01:16:31,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then they also say that parody is still fair game.

948
01:16:32,932 --> 01:16:37,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an interesting gray area too is what is what is parody?

949
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:49,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're here you ruined it that that like that channel I love their their stuff where they take they do AI voices and ruin songs like they'll have like Johnny Cash sing like

950
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,352
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube channel.

951
01:17:06,112 --> 01:17:11,415
[SPEAKER_08]: And that, honestly, I think that something like that would be a violation of his estate.

952
01:17:11,415 --> 01:17:30,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think it would if they're taking his actual vocal samples, running it through AI, you know, to have it generate words that he would have never touched in his voice, to me is a violation of

953
01:17:32,455 --> 01:17:33,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it would be parody.

954
01:17:33,696 --> 01:17:41,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a parody would be if there was a true singer who sounded like him, you know, doing it.

955
01:17:41,882 --> 01:17:43,403
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a parody.

956
01:17:43,403 --> 01:17:45,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Taking his vocal samples is theft.

957
01:17:47,182 --> 01:17:53,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and obviously relating this back to video games, because you might wonder why, what does this have to do with video games?

958
01:17:53,106 --> 01:17:57,009
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been focusing a lot on this story of musicians because that's where the blog post was going.

959
01:17:57,009 --> 01:18:11,779
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people that are, that are really getting angry at this are voice actors and the voice actors from video games, because, and this is, you know, to some of the voice actors I follow on Twitter, this is, this is a real bad issue right now is that there's these people making these YouTubes of

960
01:18:12,219 --> 01:18:15,384
[SPEAKER_01]: people doing character voices by AI.

961
01:18:15,384 --> 01:18:18,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's things that these characters would never say.

962
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:19,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's...

963
01:18:21,494 --> 01:18:24,756
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's something's got to give.

964
01:18:24,756 --> 01:18:32,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And I absolutely think these voice actors have every right to sue on these grounds when this is this is being stolen, essentially.

965
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:39,164
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you how do you make that happen without flooding the courts with issues and so forth?

966
01:18:39,164 --> 01:18:39,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

967
01:18:39,864 --> 01:18:43,666
[SPEAKER_01]: There there really doesn't seem to be an easy issue about this for sure.

968
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:44,747
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

969
01:18:44,747 --> 01:18:46,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

970
01:18:46,508 --> 01:18:48,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we need to try.

971
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go ahead.

972
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:58,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want to point out what Mike Deft said about not confusing text-to-speech with AI.

973
01:18:58,255 --> 01:19:07,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Because with text-to-speech, first of all, I'm sure anyone who's been on my channel in the last couple weeks has heard Samantha.

974
01:19:07,779 --> 01:19:11,001
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a paid actor.

975
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:18,788
[SPEAKER_08]: providing voice samples for the specific use of making things red.

976
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:23,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Like being able to convert that to text and it never sounds great.

977
01:19:23,752 --> 01:19:31,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Siri sounds great, but like a lot of those just don't sound very good because they're having to do them on the fly.

978
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:32,120
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not

979
01:19:33,241 --> 01:19:43,691
[SPEAKER_08]: AI that is simply voice synthesizing with paid for recorded voice samples.

980
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:44,391
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

981
01:19:44,391 --> 01:19:54,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in our next segment, we need to take a trip down memory lane to a time when AI just meant the computer you were playing against in a segment we call the classic game of the week.

982
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the bumper.

983
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:13,023
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

984
01:20:13,023 --> 01:20:16,905
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.

985
01:20:16,905 --> 01:20:18,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did you pick for us this week, DarkSakura?

986
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:26,471
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a fighting game that came out for the PlayStation.

987
01:20:26,471 --> 01:20:31,794
[SPEAKER_08]: It was developed by Dream Factory and published by Square in 1996.

988
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:39,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Dream Factory's very first release and Square's first release on a CD-based console.

989
01:20:40,078 --> 01:20:42,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there you go.

990
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:49,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, also, one of the big, I think, selling points about this game?

991
01:20:49,188 --> 01:20:57,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first of all, the characters were designed by Toriyama, who did the Dragon Ball series and Chrono Trigger.

992
01:20:57,918 --> 01:21:00,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And it did have a sequel named Tobal 2.

993
01:21:01,658 --> 01:21:09,923
[SPEAKER_08]: that didn't come out outside of the Asian market.

994
01:21:09,923 --> 01:21:26,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So the North American and Japanese version of the game was packaged with a playable demo of Final Fantasy VII and had previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and Saga Frontier.

995
01:21:26,832 --> 01:21:34,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, this is kind of a big deal, and honestly, I think 90... Most of the people I knew got the game for the Final Fantasy VII demo.

996
01:21:34,544 --> 01:21:34,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Guilty.

997
01:21:34,864 --> 01:21:36,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna be honest.

998
01:21:36,206 --> 01:21:36,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

999
01:21:38,021 --> 01:21:42,942
[SPEAKER_08]: But then when you go back in and play, the game is actually a fairly decent game.

1000
01:21:42,942 --> 01:21:53,625
[SPEAKER_08]: To ball number one, it was a tournament mode where two player versus a practice mode and a quest mode that used their fighting game engine.

1001
01:21:53,625 --> 01:22:01,207
[SPEAKER_08]: It ran at 60 frames a second because the polygons of the game were not textured.

1002
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:06,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And with reducing the details, it gave it a very distinctive look compared to other fighting games at the time.

1003
01:22:08,197 --> 01:22:14,598
[SPEAKER_08]: The controls were full freedom of movement in the ring as long as you face the opponent.

1004
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:17,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to know who's texting me.

1005
01:22:17,619 --> 01:22:19,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1006
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:21,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, anyway.

1007
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:26,361
[SPEAKER_08]: You also have a grappling and blocking system.

1008
01:22:26,361 --> 01:22:32,742
[SPEAKER_08]: So you had counter moves with it, you had a dash and jump, and you had like high, medium, low attacks.

1009
01:22:32,742 --> 01:22:36,103
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the quest mode as well, which lets you explore a dungeon.

1010
01:22:37,523 --> 01:22:47,707
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go down a number of floors, you have traps, you have fights waiting for you, with some of the enemies being the playable characters.

1011
01:22:47,707 --> 01:22:54,629
[SPEAKER_08]: You find items as you go, kind of like a rudimentary adventure RPG mode.

1012
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:56,090
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can't save the progress.

1013
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:58,490
[SPEAKER_08]: If you die, you start over.

1014
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:02,352
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you defeat certain characters in this mode, you unlock them as playable characters.

1015
01:23:04,309 --> 01:23:15,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So the story of the game is that it takes place in 2048 on a planet called Tobol, which has these deposits of an energy ores called Molmoron.

1016
01:23:15,895 --> 01:23:21,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the tournament is to see who has the rights to mine the ore.

1017
01:23:21,078 --> 01:23:22,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's it.

1018
01:23:22,559 --> 01:23:26,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a little bit unique as far as reasons for fighting games, but meh.

1019
01:23:27,371 --> 01:23:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Tobal No.

1020
01:23:29,132 --> 01:23:49,046
[SPEAKER_08]: 1, the music was composed by eight of Square's composers, including Mitsuda Yasunori, Kawakami Yasuhiro, Sasai Ryuji, Hamazu Masashi, Nakano Jr., Ito Kenji, Matsueda Noriko, and Shimomura Yoko.

1021
01:23:49,046 --> 01:23:49,987
[SPEAKER_08]: We know her, we love her.

1022
01:23:50,902 --> 01:24:03,505
[SPEAKER_08]: It had different music themes in electronica, rock, some instrumentals, even some kind of hip-hop and ambience, and even some jazz themes in there.

1023
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:08,686
[SPEAKER_08]: So the album was released as Tobal No.

1024
01:24:08,686 --> 01:24:14,788
[SPEAKER_08]: 1 Remixes Electrical Indian, is what it was called.

1025
01:24:14,788 --> 01:24:16,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, I mean,

1026
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:19,196
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole big thing.

1027
01:24:19,196 --> 01:24:25,742
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the 8th best-selling video game of 1998 in Japan.

1028
01:24:25,742 --> 01:24:32,308
[SPEAKER_08]: And pretty much that has been attributed to the inclusion of the Final Fantasy VII demo disc.

1029
01:24:32,308 --> 01:24:38,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually, even though it didn't sell as well in the US, it did kind of become a cult hit over here.

1030
01:24:38,633 --> 01:24:39,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It sold 99,183 copies in the US.

1031
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:47,003
[SPEAKER_08]: In Japan it sold 752,000 copies in 1996.

1032
01:24:50,789 --> 01:24:53,931
[SPEAKER_08]: The game got very positive reviews.

1033
01:24:53,931 --> 01:24:59,114
[SPEAKER_08]: It was innovative, had a different graphic approach.

1034
01:24:59,114 --> 01:25:02,515
[SPEAKER_08]: The controls left a little bit to be desired.

1035
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:14,482
[SPEAKER_08]: It was compared to Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter for the controls, with the previous games being considered much more sophisticated in their control.

1036
01:25:16,183 --> 01:25:26,115
[SPEAKER_08]: But they also said that having a game that ran at 60 frames per second in a 640x480 resolution for its time was a pretty good thing.

1037
01:25:26,115 --> 01:25:33,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people found the blocking system to be confused, but the quest system was very, very new for its time.

1038
01:25:35,326 --> 01:25:39,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So there were other releases later on.

1039
01:25:39,049 --> 01:25:40,830
[SPEAKER_08]: The sequel Tobal No.

1040
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:45,154
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 was released in 1997 for PlayStation in Japan only.

1041
01:25:45,154 --> 01:25:45,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I've played it.

1042
01:25:45,834 --> 01:25:48,216
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty okay.

1043
01:25:48,216 --> 01:25:54,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the mobile phone version called Tobal M released in Japan on December 12, 2007.

1044
01:25:54,301 --> 01:25:54,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course,

1045
01:25:59,289 --> 01:26:06,713
[SPEAKER_08]: What phones did we have in 2007 that would have been capable of running something like that in the US?

1046
01:26:06,713 --> 01:26:13,477
[SPEAKER_01]: That old Sprint flip phone I had would not have run this.

1047
01:26:13,477 --> 01:26:22,623
[SPEAKER_08]: The original iPhone release was 2006, if I remember right, yeah.

1048
01:26:24,591 --> 01:26:28,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no, that was 2007.

1049
01:26:28,093 --> 01:26:35,857
[SPEAKER_08]: The iPhone at the time could have run it, but we didn't have the app store until a little bit after the first release.

1050
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:42,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would have had to have been completely reprogrammed.

1051
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:44,402
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, that's it.

1052
01:26:44,402 --> 01:26:47,084
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the game, Toeball No.

1053
01:26:47,084 --> 01:26:47,344
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.

1054
01:26:47,344 --> 01:26:50,466
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Toeball No.

1055
01:26:50,466 --> 01:26:53,828
[SPEAKER_01]: 1, better known as the game that had the demo for Final Fantasy VII.

1056
01:26:55,031 --> 01:27:05,077
[SPEAKER_04]: See, and I always thought that was Toeball number two to have the demo for Final Fantasy VII, but I think I'm... There was another game that had a sequel, too, that I might be confusing with.

1057
01:27:05,077 --> 01:27:07,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I definitely got that for the demo.

1058
01:27:07,818 --> 01:27:17,864
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one that had... Actually, Final Fantasy VII came with the demo for Brave Fencer Musashi.

1059
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:19,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes, I did have that.

1060
01:27:20,885 --> 01:27:22,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Tobal No.

1061
01:27:22,687 --> 01:27:32,297
[SPEAKER_08]: 2 did not come out with any kind of demo disc according to this, although it got better ratings by Famitsu.

1062
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:34,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I did get it anyways.

1063
01:27:34,419 --> 01:27:36,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I am pretty sure I had Tobal No.

1064
01:27:36,241 --> 01:27:38,503
[SPEAKER_04]: 2.

1065
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:39,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1066
01:27:39,104 --> 01:27:41,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've got Tobal No.

1067
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:41,526
[SPEAKER_08]: 2.

1068
01:27:41,526 --> 01:27:43,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we imported it at the time.

1069
01:27:45,990 --> 01:27:48,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that you're Zen Monkey.

1070
01:27:48,192 --> 01:27:50,714
[SPEAKER_08]: The kangaroo was in Tekken, the Tekken series.

1071
01:27:50,714 --> 01:27:54,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember there was a kangaroo in the Topal games.

1072
01:27:54,577 --> 01:28:00,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know that you could fight a Chocobo in Topal number two.

1073
01:28:00,341 --> 01:28:03,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's awesome.

1074
01:28:03,463 --> 01:28:04,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1075
01:28:04,084 --> 01:28:05,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Work.

1076
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:06,846
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1077
01:28:06,846 --> 01:28:13,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's check out a few other headlines here real quick in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.

1078
01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:13,711
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with Loki.

1079
01:28:14,673 --> 01:28:22,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, so apparently it's the 25th anniversary of Half-Life, and they've released an update to go along with that.

1080
01:28:22,395 --> 01:28:33,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So Half-Life has gotten the 25th anniversary update, which adds some new multiplayer maps as well as some technical improvements as well.

1081
01:28:33,078 --> 01:28:42,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have three new multiplayer maps, Double Cross, Rust Mill, Zen DM, and two multiplayer models, Skeleton and Too Much Coffee Man.

1082
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I love too much coffee, man.

1083
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,121
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

1084
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:54,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it was free, and I think it still is free for a specific period of time.

1085
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:59,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember when that's... But I think it's free for now, because my kids were telling me about that, too.

1086
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,824
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like, oh, hey, did you know Half-Life is free?

1087
01:29:01,824 --> 01:29:03,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'm pretty sure I already own that.

1088
01:29:06,451 --> 01:29:14,795
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course, along with that, they've also released a 25th anniversary Half-Life documentary from Valve.

1089
01:29:14,795 --> 01:29:18,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can probably check that out, I'm guessing, for free as well.

1090
01:29:20,782 --> 01:29:34,330
[SPEAKER_04]: The 25th anniversary update includes Half-Life Uplink, which was originally released as a CD exclusive for magazines and hardware manufacturers.

1091
01:29:34,330 --> 01:29:37,292
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a piece of something you can do.

1092
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:39,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mini-campaign.

1093
01:29:39,153 --> 01:29:46,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also did the four new multiplayer maps, including Contamination Pool Party, Disposal, and Rocket Frenzy.

1094
01:29:48,356 --> 01:29:51,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, I will have to check that out.

1095
01:29:51,638 --> 01:29:51,958
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1096
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:55,980
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 25 years of Half-Life 3, the perfect time to announce Half-Life 3.

1097
01:29:55,980 --> 01:30:02,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Just saying, Valve, you know, like... That was literally the only reason why I checked the announcement.

1098
01:30:02,584 --> 01:30:09,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could be just waiting for, you know, a certain game awards type show to announce something that epic.

1099
01:30:09,007 --> 01:30:09,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't set the bar.

1100
01:30:09,848 --> 01:30:11,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't set the bar at that.

1101
01:30:11,368 --> 01:30:13,009
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just leave disappointed.

1102
01:30:13,009 --> 01:30:16,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't don't do that to yourself.

1103
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:17,772
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, DarkSakura, what do you have?

1104
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:23,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I also have a correction to make.

1105
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:27,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So Final Fantasy VII didn't have a demo disc with it.

1106
01:30:27,142 --> 01:30:32,506
[SPEAKER_08]: It was with Musashi, the demo for Final Fantasy VIII came with that.

1107
01:30:32,506 --> 01:30:33,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

1108
01:30:33,727 --> 01:30:35,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1109
01:30:35,068 --> 01:30:37,089
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I knew there was a correlation, though.

1110
01:30:37,089 --> 01:30:40,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So I definitely got a double one for the Final Fantasy VII demo because I remember playing that.

1111
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:55,124
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog for November 2023 has been announced.

1112
01:30:55,124 --> 01:31:00,290
[SPEAKER_08]: We have alternate Jake Hunter Daedalus The Awakening of Golden Jazz.

1113
01:31:02,038 --> 01:31:26,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Island Riptide Definitive Edition, Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen, Ayudin Chronicles Rising, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Maxi Boost On, Nobunaga's Ambition Taishi, River City Melee Mach, Superliminal, Teardown, and then Grandia,

1114
01:31:27,464 --> 01:31:38,194
[SPEAKER_08]: is apparently, uh... I think that it's a Grandia, uh... No, it's the original Grandia, nevermind, because I know that they're doing a Grandia remaster.

1115
01:31:38,194 --> 01:31:47,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And I take very big exception with this, saying that it was a classic PlayStation RPG, when this shit came out on the Sega Saturn first, get it right.

1116
01:31:49,229 --> 01:32:02,581
[SPEAKER_08]: JetMoto, also coming out from PlayStation Stuff for PS2, Parappa the Rapper 2, PSP Up, and for PS4, Klonoa Fantasy Reverie Series.

1117
01:32:02,581 --> 01:32:04,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I love freakin' Klonoa.

1118
01:32:04,663 --> 01:32:06,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Game made me cry.

1119
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:06,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugly cry!

1120
01:32:06,665 --> 01:32:08,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's it.

1121
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:13,920
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and what do I have for us?

1122
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you brought up Dragon's Dogma 2.

1123
01:32:15,741 --> 01:32:27,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's going to be a whole showcase coming up on that on November 28th that will show 15 whole minutes of new information and gameplay reveals.

1124
01:32:27,648 --> 01:32:37,054
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be at 1 o'clock Pacific, 4 o'clock Eastern on YouTube, directly from director Hideki Itsuno and producer of the game, of course, Dragon's Dogma 2.

1125
01:32:37,634 --> 01:32:42,379
[SPEAKER_01]: being developed for PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series and PC via Steam as well.

1126
01:32:42,379 --> 01:32:47,745
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know the release date yet, but soon.

1127
01:32:47,745 --> 01:32:53,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So speaking of release dates, let's travel around and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner.

1128
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:55,954
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go to Loki in the U.S.

1129
01:32:55,954 --> 01:32:56,194
[SPEAKER_01]: first.

1130
01:32:57,421 --> 01:33:03,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, this is probably going to be one of the last few weeks that we have a few things coming out.

1131
01:33:03,046 --> 01:33:09,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So, In the Stars and Time on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.

1132
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:16,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, we've got Pew Pew, Molcar, Let's Molcar Party on Nintendo Switch.

1135
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:52,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there, although I'm going to guess it's probably a pretty slow week, even if the holidays don't flow the same way.

1136
01:33:52,284 --> 01:33:57,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the Nintendo Switch, on the 22nd of November, we have R.E.D.

1137
01:33:57,666 --> 01:33:59,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherish.

1138
01:33:59,106 --> 01:33:59,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It's R.E.

1139
01:33:59,727 --> 01:34:02,408
[SPEAKER_01]: colon D, and it's like an anime or a manga.

1140
01:34:02,408 --> 01:34:04,209
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like Resident Evil or something like that.

1141
01:34:04,209 --> 01:34:04,689
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool.

1142
01:34:05,589 --> 01:34:27,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Dischronia Chronos Alternate Definitive Edition is also out on the 22nd, as is Kud Wafter Converted Edition is out on the Switch as well, and Getsui no Kusari Sakuran Paranoia is out in a regular and special edition in Japan, all of that on the 23rd actually is that game's release.

1143
01:34:27,486 --> 01:34:28,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Checking out the PlayStation 5,

1144
01:34:30,229 --> 01:34:43,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Stray gets its Japanese release in Japan on November 22nd Meet Your Maker, another game we got here a few months ago, is also out in Japan on the 22nd With that, we can travel over to Europe, DarkSakura!

1145
01:34:47,365 --> 01:34:49,307
[SPEAKER_08]: So, just a handful.

1146
01:34:49,307 --> 01:34:55,654
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 21st we have Pui Pui Molcar Let's Molcar Party, that's for Switch.

1147
01:34:55,654 --> 01:35:01,700
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 23rd for PlayStation and Switch we have Spirit of the Island Paradise Edition.

1148
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:04,523
[SPEAKER_08]: On the 24th, the rest of these are the 24th,

01:35:05,564 --> 01:35:10,910
[SPEAKER_08]: We have, for PlayStation and Switch, TMNT Shredder's Revenge Anniversary Edition.

1150
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:14,654
[SPEAKER_08]: For Xbox, Disney Dreamlight Valley Cozy Edition.

1151

1153
01:35:24,706 --> 01:35:24,986
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1154
01:35:27,177 --> 01:35:28,118
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1155
01:35:28,118 --> 01:35:35,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, usually we would do some more stories at this point, but we've kind of hit the end of all the stories we had slotted tonight.

1156
01:35:35,983 --> 01:35:42,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a little bit of a shorter Newsweek this week, so this is the part where we're going to get into the listener roundtable.

1157
01:35:42,728 --> 01:35:49,393
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will say real quick, I'm actually very glad that, DarkSakura, you were reading that story and you mentioned Ayoden Chronicle.

1158
01:35:49,993 --> 01:36:06,181
[SPEAKER_01]: because it reminded me, oops, I backed that on Kickstarter, I don't know how many years ago, and I have until this week to pick what platform I get my digital key on, and I forgot to do it, so I'm doing it right now to make sure I get the platform that I want, which I think I'm gonna go with PlayStation 5.

1159
01:36:06,181 --> 01:36:10,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see why maybe Nintendo Switch, but I'm gonna go with PlayStation 5.

1160
01:36:10,042 --> 01:36:17,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's... I thought I'd already picked Xbox some time ago, but I didn't have a PS5 then, so I'm gonna go PS5.

1161
01:36:18,447 --> 01:36:20,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet I thought you'd all like to know.

1162
01:36:20,889 --> 01:36:23,171
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get to the Lister roundtable.

1163
01:36:23,171 --> 01:36:25,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Glad that I inadvertently reminded you of a thing.

1164
01:36:25,633 --> 01:36:31,899
[SPEAKER_01]: You did because I'd like to get my you know, thing that I paid for and like literally forgot about because it's been so fucking long.

1165
01:36:31,899 --> 01:36:34,481
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am excited to play the game to be honest.

1166
01:36:34,481 --> 01:36:35,562
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is that.

1167
01:36:38,351 --> 01:36:43,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's move on and travel list a roundtable.

1168
01:36:43,572 --> 01:36:49,414
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna invite your emails participate at OrangeLoungeTrader.com is the place to send us an email.

1169
01:36:49,414 --> 01:36:51,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw one come in just before the show.

1170
01:36:51,495 --> 01:36:52,335
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one.

1171
01:36:52,335 --> 01:36:52,835
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one.

1172
01:36:52,835 --> 01:36:53,935
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one.

1173
01:36:53,935 --> 01:36:54,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, there's an email.

1174
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:55,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.

1175
01:36:55,576 --> 01:36:55,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold up.

1176
01:36:55,796 --> 01:36:56,896
[SPEAKER_01]: We got an email.

1177
01:36:56,896 --> 01:36:57,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna faint.

1178
01:36:57,796 --> 01:36:58,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna faint.

1179
01:37:01,661 --> 01:37:06,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like, you know, like Janine in Ghostbusters.

1180
01:37:06,113 --> 01:37:07,777
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got one.

1181
01:37:07,777 --> 01:37:08,058
Anyway.

1182
01:37:12,003 --> 01:37:14,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I will start off.

1183
01:37:14,664 --> 01:37:17,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR fam, it's your girl Mishi here.

1184
01:37:17,726 --> 01:37:22,148
[SPEAKER_08]: First and foremost, please excuse the grammatical errors as I am writing this on my cell phone.

1185
01:37:22,148 --> 01:37:24,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll forgive you this once.

1186
01:37:24,329 --> 01:37:26,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, now down to what I wanted to say.

1187
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:32,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all, y'all listen, I've never been so disappointed in a game company as I have for the makers of Coral Island.

1188
01:37:32,632 --> 01:37:33,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to like the game.

1189
01:37:33,553 --> 01:37:38,135
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I want to love it, but it feels like they're not even trying to fix their mess up.

1190
01:37:38,835 --> 01:37:48,017
[SPEAKER_08]: In my honest opinion, they never should have bothered releasing the game on console, especially if they were only planning on releasing half of it for console players.

1191
01:37:48,017 --> 01:37:51,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, they're aware of the mess up, but this one's a pretty big one.

1192
01:37:51,578 --> 01:37:54,539
[SPEAKER_08]: When are they going to fix it?

1193
01:37:54,539 --> 01:37:59,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Might I add, the errors are, as far as I know, on console.

1194
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:01,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank goodness I didn't pay for it, because I'd be even more upset.

1195
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:12,073
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what I heard, and please correct me if I'm wrong, they released it so fast because apparently Humble Bundle is going under?

1196
01:38:12,073 --> 01:38:13,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard anything about that.

1197
01:38:13,794 --> 01:38:24,938
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's the case, they never should have released it at all specifically for console, and I'm praying Core Keeper and Roots of Pacha, which are both due out soon on Switch, don't make the same mistake.

1198
01:38:24,938 --> 01:38:30,440
[SPEAKER_08]: As a gamer, am I even a little bit wrong for feeling saltier than the Dead Sea?

1199
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:31,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Disgruntled Gamer.

1200
01:38:32,665 --> 01:38:34,346
[SPEAKER_08]: How you feel is how you feel.

1201
01:38:34,346 --> 01:38:38,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know the whole situation behind it, and I've never heard of the game before.

1202
01:38:38,647 --> 01:38:42,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also never heard of anything about Humble Bundle going over.

1203
01:38:42,508 --> 01:38:44,449
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going under.

1204
01:38:44,449 --> 01:38:45,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So I looked into it a little bit.

1205
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:55,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Humble isn't going under, but in a report from four days ago, which did not make our show roll tonight, Humble Games was the latest to lay off employees.

1206
01:38:56,293 --> 01:39:18,539
[SPEAKER_01]: um not really um so humble bundle of course started in 2010 and uh let's see on linkedin some folks were uh reporting that they lost positions saying it's a sad day at humble games for a lot of folks um let's see i realized some digital news outlets have read into my a lot of folks quite literally and linking to my profile trying to do some napkin math

1207
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:26,486
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see, when you have one ounce of empathy, you realize the impact of layoffs on the people who are laid off, of course, but also on the people who are not laid off.

1208
01:39:26,486 --> 01:39:28,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is indeed a lot of people.

1209
01:39:28,067 --> 01:39:37,276
[SPEAKER_01]: So it hasn't been revealed how many were laid off, but that may be why the rumors are swirling the way they are.

1210
01:39:37,276 --> 01:39:41,239
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the total truth, but there is

1211
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised to hear what happened there

1212
01:40:01,771 --> 01:40:15,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like I said, I haven't heard of the game, but if it's a game that you want to love and it's come out in such a tainted edition, then you're well within your rights to feel the way that you do.

1213
01:40:15,504 --> 01:40:17,146
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the consumer of this.

1214
01:40:18,618 --> 01:40:20,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1215
01:40:20,358 --> 01:40:23,579
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Stardew Valley-ish is the game, basically.

1216
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:32,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of on the backs of that game's popularity, but it has more of like an isometric, we'll say Zelda link to the past kind of look to it.

1217
01:40:32,661 --> 01:40:34,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not even really sprite based.

1218
01:40:34,662 --> 01:40:40,063
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just it kind of has that more kind of 2D-esque, tilted 2D, we'll say, view of that.

1219
01:40:40,063 --> 01:40:43,164
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least from what I've seen of it, it looks cute.

1220
01:40:43,164 --> 01:40:47,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play it at some point if I didn't have a backlog a mile long to catch up on.

1221
01:40:48,385 --> 01:40:52,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So, speaking of, thank you for the email, and we invite more emails.

1222
01:40:52,508 --> 01:40:55,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1223
01:40:55,611 --> 01:41:01,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of catching up, you know, I often turn to the phones that are Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, and they are empty.

1224
01:41:02,554 --> 01:41:03,795
[SPEAKER_01]: but not tonight.

1225
01:41:03,795 --> 01:41:06,016
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a call waiting to come on the show.

1226
01:41:06,016 --> 01:41:06,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.

1227
01:41:06,676 --> 01:41:08,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.

1228
01:41:08,197 --> 01:41:10,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I was hoping to hear from this person last week.

1229
01:41:10,738 --> 01:41:14,040
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what Blanche Devereaux says better late than pregnant.

1230
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,001
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's welcome on to the show.

1231
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:18,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, YYR.

1232
01:41:19,967 --> 01:41:22,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, I thought you were gonna let me say who I was.

1233
01:41:22,329 --> 01:41:24,731
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I decided to ruin it.

1234
01:41:24,731 --> 01:41:39,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, as I was laying it up there, I was saying I was actually hoping secretly to hear from you last week, but then the Pokemon Go was telling me why I might not have heard from you last week.

1235
01:41:39,764 --> 01:41:42,267
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell was that?

1236
01:41:42,267 --> 01:41:43,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Who hit the shade button?

1237
01:41:43,988 --> 01:41:47,371
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't know how much of that you wanted me to say on air.

1238
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:50,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, okay, I guess I'm not surprised to hear not from YYR.

1239
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:53,156
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure you had to have listened last week.

1240
01:41:53,156 --> 01:41:55,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Please tell me you listened to last week's show.

1241
01:41:55,698 --> 01:41:58,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know what, I didn't actually get through the whole thing.

1242
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:00,402
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did listen to the opening segment.

1243
01:42:00,402 --> 01:42:01,623
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why I'm calling in tonight.

1244
01:42:01,623 --> 01:42:03,505
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you heard the beginning, as long as you heard, yes, that's fine.

1245
01:42:03,505 --> 01:42:03,865
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

1246
01:42:03,865 --> 01:42:07,008
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you heard the beginning, you know, that's, that's the part I needed you to hear.

1247
01:42:07,008 --> 01:42:12,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure, in the great words of Jerry Blake, I've got something to say.

1248
01:42:13,456 --> 01:42:15,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, of course.

1249
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:21,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've got something to say about everything.

1250
01:42:21,363 --> 01:42:32,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to clarify because the thing is, regarding what happened to the North American players with Konami Arcade Championship DDR this year,

1251
01:42:35,325 --> 01:42:36,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it sucks.

1252
01:42:36,987 --> 01:42:38,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was bullshit.

1253
01:42:38,828 --> 01:42:51,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is an actual logical reason as to why the American finalists were disqualified that was avoidable, but it's bullshit.

1254
01:42:53,618 --> 01:43:06,123
[SPEAKER_05]: But to understand it, I just, I do need to go into a little bit of boring background on Konami's esoteric rules and, you know, what, what led to this.

1255
01:43:06,123 --> 01:43:07,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get my pillow.

1256
01:43:07,504 --> 01:43:09,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.

1257
01:43:09,564 --> 01:43:14,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But, well, you may want to get a pen and paper if we still use those things.

1258
01:43:14,767 --> 01:43:15,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's all about OneNote.

1259
01:43:18,371 --> 01:43:23,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well get your fingers ready then.

1260
01:43:23,133 --> 01:43:41,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what it boils down to is, so if you go back to 2016, when DDR Ace released, and I just saw the head almost fall off on Jamie's avatar, so that was fun.

1261
01:43:41,682 --> 01:43:42,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, if you go back to 2016,

1262
01:43:45,888 --> 01:43:54,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we suddenly had access to a current version of DDR with EMUs and everything.

1263
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:58,891
[SPEAKER_05]: So, of course, we all wanted to sign up.

1264
01:43:58,891 --> 01:44:03,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you buy the card, you log in for the first time.

1265
01:44:03,512 --> 01:44:07,333
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't actually ever need to go to Konami's website.

1266
01:44:07,333 --> 01:44:10,474
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use the score saving and whatnot in the game.

1267
01:44:11,635 --> 01:44:14,777
[SPEAKER_05]: and unlock things without ever having to do that.

1268
01:44:14,777 --> 01:44:29,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to fully take advantage of the game's features like adding rivals and setting some additional options and entering things like KAC, you do have to create a Konami ID.

1269
01:44:29,806 --> 01:44:30,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you do that,

1270
01:44:31,327 --> 01:44:40,655
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to say, okay, it's this country that I'm creating the Konami ID for, and that country is locked and can't be changed.

1271
01:44:40,655 --> 01:44:47,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Though, when the game came out, we all created North American accounts because, well, we're in North America.

1272
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: But after a while, we started to understand that there were certain features

1273
01:44:53,427 --> 01:44:57,715
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1274
01:45:04,795 --> 01:45:16,322
[SPEAKER_05]: The basic course specifically, things like the ability to set certain options in the game, like make your background darker, put the arrows in front of the combo display, you know, stupid stuff.

1275
01:45:16,322 --> 01:45:23,086
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to set these things, you needed a Japanese region account.

1276
01:45:23,948 --> 01:45:33,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this wasn't a big deal back then, because what you could do, and what we all did, was create a second Konami ID for Japan region.

1277
01:45:33,595 --> 01:45:43,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what we could then do is detach our e-amusement pass, the card we use to log in, which exists as a separate entity from your Konami ID.

1278
01:45:43,982 --> 01:45:49,806
[SPEAKER_05]: We could detach it from our North American account and just reattach it to the Japanese account.

1279
01:45:49,806 --> 01:45:50,747
[SPEAKER_05]: We lose nothing.

1280
01:45:51,548 --> 01:45:56,149
[SPEAKER_05]: and we gained a whole lot of extra features.

1281
01:45:56,149 --> 01:46:07,232
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, you need a Japan region account now in order to access all the new home versions of Bimani games.

1282
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:19,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when Konami Arcade Championship happened for the first time in DDR Ace, and everyone was super excited about that, we read the rules and it said

1283
01:46:20,686 --> 01:46:28,608
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to enter with a Konami ID that matches your region of residence, or you will not be able to enter the finals.

1284
01:46:28,608 --> 01:46:30,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did we all do?

1285
01:46:30,409 --> 01:46:37,531
[SPEAKER_05]: We switched, uh, we switched back from our Japan region to North American region.

1286
01:46:37,531 --> 01:46:41,512
[SPEAKER_05]: We detached our card from Japan, reattached it to North America.

1287
01:46:41,512 --> 01:46:42,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.

1288
01:46:42,092 --> 01:46:44,853
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all able to enter KAC.

1289
01:46:44,853 --> 01:46:49,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Three North Americans went to finals that year, and I believe ChrisChike won.

1290
01:46:51,116 --> 01:46:52,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was a great time.

1291
01:46:52,937 --> 01:46:59,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It was exciting to watch, it raised awareness of the game, it got a lot of people excited.

1292
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, awesome.

1293
01:47:01,542 --> 01:47:03,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Fast forward to now.

1294
01:47:03,202 --> 01:47:06,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and there's one other fact I'm going to throw in.

1295
01:47:06,344 --> 01:47:17,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year, for I don't even know how long, Konami has added new songs to the game that debut with the KAC qualifiers.

1296
01:47:18,237 --> 01:47:25,307
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because obviously they got to make things a little more challenging, give you something that nobody has ever seen before.

1297
01:47:25,307 --> 01:47:26,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1298
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:28,091
[SPEAKER_01]: That part's cool.

1299
01:47:28,091 --> 01:47:33,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but the thing is, in order to unlock those songs, you have to register for KAC.

1300
01:47:36,909 --> 01:47:48,674
[SPEAKER_05]: You log in with your card on the website, you basically click a button, and then you're officially entered into KAC, and those songs unlock the next time you play the game.

1301
01:47:48,674 --> 01:47:50,235
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's cool.

1302
01:47:51,115 --> 01:47:53,017
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, fast forward to this year.

1303
01:47:53,017 --> 01:48:04,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to point out like so far, this is a pretty convoluted system by Konami's own making that everybody just kind of played around with because, you know, they just played along with it because, okay, this is how we get the features.

1304
01:48:04,486 --> 01:48:05,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1305
01:48:05,907 --> 01:48:07,268
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to this shit from Konami.

1306
01:48:07,268 --> 01:48:08,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1307
01:48:08,549 --> 01:48:12,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give us the new songs because that's essentially what it is.

1308
01:48:12,552 --> 01:48:16,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us the same features and same songs as you've given everyone else.

1309
01:48:16,155 --> 01:48:17,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do that.

1310
01:48:17,356 --> 01:48:20,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll play this little game so we can just have the same features as everyone else.

1311
01:48:26,748 --> 01:48:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, fast forward to this year.

1312
01:48:29,549 --> 01:48:35,830
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first time that North America has been eligible for KAC since pre-COVID.

1313
01:48:35,830 --> 01:48:42,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what happened, you know, when the year COVID started, they were gonna do KAC, but they

1314
01:48:43,912 --> 01:49:00,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they delayed the finals for more than a year, and limited it to Japan only, and then it was cut down the following year, and so this is the first year that they were actually running a legit KAC and inviting North America to enter again.

1315
01:49:00,818 --> 01:49:10,221
[SPEAKER_05]: However, one thing changed, one significant thing changed, back in January of this year, for some reason, I don't know what reason,

1316
01:49:11,155 --> 01:49:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami decided to stop allowing e-amusement passes to be detached from one region's account and added to another region's account.

1317
01:49:22,365 --> 01:49:24,767
[SPEAKER_05]: That is no longer possible.

1318
01:49:24,767 --> 01:49:33,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone who's playing in North America who has a Japanese Konami ID, guess what?

1319
01:49:33,695 --> 01:49:35,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Our cards are stuck in Japan.

1320
01:49:35,697 --> 01:49:37,018
[SPEAKER_05]: We can no longer remove them.

1321
01:49:37,018 --> 01:49:38,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did Konami do this?

1322
01:49:39,318 --> 01:49:42,919
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a good question that I do not have the answer for.

1323
01:49:42,919 --> 01:49:51,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is completely the answer I expected, and I set you up for that, because... Why?

1324
01:49:51,182 --> 01:49:52,763
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the reason?

1325
01:49:52,763 --> 01:49:54,363
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no reason.

1326
01:49:54,363 --> 01:49:56,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, sorry, please continue.

1327
01:49:56,504 --> 01:50:06,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what that created was a situation where anyone who wanted to enter KAC needed to buy a second card,

1328
01:50:07,179 --> 01:50:21,886
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, create, you know, their account, register for KAC, and then use their sub-account, for lack of a better term, to actually play the songs and qualify and, you know, get the best score possible.

1329
01:50:21,886 --> 01:50:35,152
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I'm sure, as someone who gotta catch em all, you know, a fellow gamer who gotta catch em all, you understand the importance of having everything unlocked on your main account, yes?

1330
01:50:35,152 --> 01:50:36,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh, uh-huh, 100%.

1331
01:50:37,950 --> 01:50:47,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the only way to unlock those two songs, as usual, is to register for KAC on your main account.

1332
01:50:47,538 --> 01:50:49,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Which they did.

1333
01:50:49,339 --> 01:50:51,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the problem.

1334
01:50:51,681 --> 01:51:02,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Because another one of the KAC rules that has always been there is, if you enter using multiple accounts, you will be disqualified.

1335
01:51:02,669 --> 01:51:02,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

1336
01:51:04,605 --> 01:51:18,575
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a way that North Americans could compete and not be disqualified, and that was they could not register and unlock those two songs on their main accounts.

1337
01:51:18,575 --> 01:51:28,523
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have to intentionally not unlock those songs and wait for them to be unlocked for everybody, which could be one or two years or more.

1338
01:51:30,151 --> 01:51:30,931
[SPEAKER_05]: which sucks.

1339
01:51:52,438 --> 01:52:03,581
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wanted to know, they could certainly find out how many people are switching their regions and why they might be doing that and read into what the players want if they wanted to do that.

1340
01:52:04,366 --> 01:52:11,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people are switching the regions because there's so many games, their games that are being licensed to U.S.

1341
01:52:11,352 --> 01:52:13,914
[SPEAKER_04]: arcades that they want the unlocks on.

1342
01:52:13,914 --> 01:52:14,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know.

1343
01:52:14,535 --> 01:52:15,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That's stupid.

1344
01:52:15,635 --> 01:52:17,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it is stupid.

1345
01:52:17,637 --> 01:52:18,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

1346
01:52:18,017 --> 01:52:23,302
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if the reason was music licensing, we can't have a song here, da, da, da, da, da.

1347
01:52:23,302 --> 01:52:23,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1348
01:52:23,982 --> 01:52:26,445
[SPEAKER_01]: But then why was it open to switching in the first place?

1349
01:52:27,085 --> 01:52:29,467
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because somebody moves.

1350
01:52:29,467 --> 01:52:32,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, how often does that actually happen?

1351
01:52:32,268 --> 01:52:43,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, maybe if that big life event like that happens, you just either a suck it up and start over or be maybe a longer process of contacting Konami with a piece of mail.

1352
01:52:43,295 --> 01:52:44,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't fucking know.

1353
01:52:44,356 --> 01:52:50,420
[SPEAKER_01]: But it should it should not be what it was now, you know, like it and just to take it away for literally no reason.

1354
01:52:51,567 --> 01:53:02,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and another thing, because you can't switch to Japan region anymore, the players using these sub-accounts are also at a disadvantage because...

1355
01:53:04,914 --> 01:53:05,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatchamacallit.

1356
01:53:05,555 --> 01:53:15,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because you can't make the background darker, and you can't, you know, those options are still locked to Japan region because they're locked behind a subscription, so... For no reason.

1357
01:53:15,843 --> 01:53:18,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is there a subscription to make the game accessible?

1358
01:53:18,665 --> 01:53:23,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Easier to... It's just... Well, that's for Japan, too.

1359
01:53:23,309 --> 01:53:26,632
[SPEAKER_05]: The Japanese people have to subscribe to that in order to set that stuff.

1360
01:53:26,632 --> 01:53:27,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

1361
01:53:27,433 --> 01:53:28,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care who has it.

1362
01:53:28,393 --> 01:53:29,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still bullshit.

1363
01:53:29,294 --> 01:53:29,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1364
01:53:29,574 --> 01:53:30,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

1365
01:53:30,955 --> 01:53:33,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to argue that it's bullshit.

1366
01:53:33,257 --> 01:53:33,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

1367
01:53:34,598 --> 01:53:36,419
[SPEAKER_01]: What's so what's your take on it?

1368
01:53:36,419 --> 01:53:37,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of okay.

1369
01:53:37,479 --> 01:53:43,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for laying it out Even though I'm kind of sitting here going okay Konami continues to be convoluted and frustrating.

1370
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:52,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and and and basically the the emails that like if basically the way the emails read to me is

1371
01:53:53,263 --> 01:54:04,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami sent to Chris Chaik, who by the way, it was just absolutely gut-wrenching to hear you read his Twitter comments because it sucks.

1372
01:54:04,550 --> 01:54:13,135
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the way I read his email, those emails was, you know, Konami sends to Chris, so it looks like

1373
01:54:13,855 --> 01:54:16,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You're using multiple accounts, can you explain yourself?

1374
01:54:16,938 --> 01:54:24,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris sent what he did, and Konami read that and said, okay, you have confirmed that you use multiple accounts, therefore you're disqualified.

1375
01:54:24,984 --> 01:54:27,506
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Korean players?

1376
01:54:27,506 --> 01:54:29,508
[SPEAKER_04]: As pointed out in chat by SSJ100Matt.

1377
01:54:31,794 --> 01:54:36,798
[SPEAKER_05]: The Korea is basically the same situation as us.

1378
01:54:36,798 --> 01:54:50,528
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're asking about FFM specifically, I don't think he qualified, but he was personally invited to compete in the finals, and he turned them down.

1379
01:54:51,761 --> 01:54:55,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a fundamental understanding of another question.

1380
01:54:55,983 --> 01:54:58,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Kris win something big the last time there was one of these?

1381
01:54:58,864 --> 01:55:00,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, he's won world champion twice.

1382
01:55:10,502 --> 01:55:14,725
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I'm not for people getting special treatment and all that stuff.

1383
01:55:14,725 --> 01:55:30,474
[SPEAKER_01]: However, circumstances be what they may, knowing that Konami has these convoluted rules, as Chris points out in his email, why he had to do what he had to do, knowing that Chris is a multiple world championship winning thing, why was he not given a special invitation to do this?

1384
01:55:30,894 --> 01:55:33,477
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that that's the part that like doesn't click for me.

1385
01:55:33,477 --> 01:55:39,364
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I don't know the guy very well, if his attitude sucks or something, I would not be aware of it.

1386
01:55:39,364 --> 01:55:43,689
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not getting that sense at all from people that seem to know him.

1387
01:55:43,689 --> 01:55:50,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And the again, the post he made on Twitter seemed very like, I just like, ow, I felt that.

1388
01:55:50,777 --> 01:55:52,598
[SPEAKER_01]: like was that that thing he wrote on Twitter.

1389
01:55:52,598 --> 01:55:55,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, I felt that like it seemed very like relatable.

1390
01:55:55,439 --> 01:56:02,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just I was just kind of in shock that like so why did Konami reach out to some people but not to others?

1391
01:56:02,102 --> 01:56:04,564
[SPEAKER_05]: That also doesn't make sense.

1392
01:56:04,564 --> 01:56:04,984
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1393
01:56:04,984 --> 01:56:10,346
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I will say he's not 100 percent free of controversy, but I have met him.

1394
01:56:10,346 --> 01:56:13,068
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a really cool, chill dude.

1395
01:56:13,068 --> 01:56:13,568
[SPEAKER_05]: He is.

1396
01:56:13,568 --> 01:56:14,528
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a nice guy.

1397
01:56:14,528 --> 01:56:15,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel for him.

1398
01:56:15,749 --> 01:56:18,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, none of us are free of controversy, to be fair.

1399
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:19,551
[SPEAKER_01]: None of us are free of controversy.

1400
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:22,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So, especially not me.

1401
01:56:22,752 --> 01:56:26,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't expect you to be Konami's defense here, YYR.

1402
01:56:26,493 --> 01:56:35,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you giving a better understanding of this whole thing, but it's just, you know, it's still just- Yeah, I wasn't so much defending them as more explaining what happened.

1403
01:56:36,577 --> 01:56:39,580
[SPEAKER_05]: that, yeah, that we hope you continue to support.

1404
01:56:39,580 --> 01:56:43,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, SSJ100 Madden chat says, I hate that they just gave him the canned.

1405
01:56:43,143 --> 01:56:45,325
[SPEAKER_05]: We hope you continue to support Konami.

1406
01:56:45,325 --> 01:56:49,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, that's just their standard response.

1407
01:56:49,488 --> 01:56:52,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very Japanese company standard response.

1408
01:56:52,211 --> 01:56:55,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably nobody important that was actually writing that email.

1409
01:56:55,033 --> 01:57:02,880
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's that part of me that goes, could no one at Konami like critically think about how they're treating a former world champion?

1410
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:07,142
[SPEAKER_01]: of title not held by many people who advocates for their game.

1411
01:57:07,142 --> 01:57:08,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't think they care.

1412
01:57:08,924 --> 01:57:12,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then my response is, well, I don't care.

1413
01:57:12,246 --> 01:57:16,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, you know, and like, why do we continue to support DDR?

1414
01:57:16,829 --> 01:57:19,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Though granted, I don't support it the way I used to.

1415
01:57:19,171 --> 01:57:21,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And that part of that's age, stamina, etc.

1416
01:57:21,112 --> 01:57:22,153
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill in the blank here.

1417
01:57:22,153 --> 01:57:30,039
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just like when I hear about this type of shit, I'm not exactly excited to jump back in and say, Oh, yeah, I got to get back in the DDR community.

1418
01:57:30,039 --> 01:57:31,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

1419
01:57:34,286 --> 01:57:50,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a very strange time right now between the Dave and Buster's business, the Round One business, and there's a controversial thing they added to the game recently too.

1420
01:57:52,694 --> 01:58:16,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Something called... I don't know how familiar you are with the current version of the game where, you know, they give you a choice between the normal mode and the premium mode, and in Japan the premium mode costs more, and in some countries the premium mode costs double, but, you know, it gives you access to extra stage, it's insurance if you fail in the first or second song, you get to keep going, you know, that kind of thing.

1421
01:58:18,021 --> 01:58:31,171
[SPEAKER_05]: They've added now something called Galaxy Play, which basically, they've increased over time the amount of plays that you need to unlock a song.

1422
01:58:31,171 --> 01:58:33,153
[SPEAKER_05]: They've made that more difficult.

1423
01:58:34,113 --> 01:58:40,517
[SPEAKER_05]: They've locked a significant amount of content in the new version.

1424
01:58:40,517 --> 01:58:43,678
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it has to be unlocked before it can be played.

1425
01:58:43,678 --> 01:58:53,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Galaxy Play, if you select that, any song that is not unlocked, you play it once, you don't even need to pass, it's unlocked.

1426
01:58:53,644 --> 01:58:55,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.

1427
01:58:55,285 --> 01:58:56,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they added like a...

1428
01:58:58,143 --> 01:59:06,584
[SPEAKER_05]: a new event with this update, and normally you have to play nine songs before you can access the event.

1429
01:59:06,584 --> 01:59:09,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's three if you pick this thing.

1430
01:59:09,705 --> 01:59:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds great.

1431
01:59:11,065 --> 01:59:17,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It literally costs three credits to play one game of Galaxy Play.

1432
01:59:17,946 --> 01:59:22,647
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to swipe your card three times to play once.

1433
01:59:22,647 --> 01:59:24,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a question for you, YYR.

1434
01:59:24,488 --> 01:59:26,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever played a game called Step Maniacs?

1435
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:34,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, it's been a long time since I got to play it.

1436
01:59:34,933 --> 01:59:38,535
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually now have in my mall two of them.

1437
01:59:38,535 --> 01:59:44,919
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is apparently the brand new Super Deluxe model, and it costs a fortune to play also.

1438
01:59:44,919 --> 01:59:46,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love what they've done with it.

1439
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pretty good game, huh?

1440
01:59:48,061 --> 01:59:48,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great game.

1441
01:59:48,762 --> 01:59:49,602
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great game.

1442
01:59:49,602 --> 01:59:50,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.

1443
01:59:50,583 --> 01:59:53,504
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great game.

1444
01:59:53,504 --> 01:59:55,165
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.

1445
01:59:55,165 --> 01:59:55,946
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say.

1446
01:59:56,874 --> 02:00:03,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that they haven't tried to do some sort of like, you know, competitive series or something like that as a response.

1447
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:05,422
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been interesting.

1448
02:00:05,422 --> 02:00:07,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, oh, these players aren't invited.

1449
02:00:07,483 --> 02:00:09,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll just do our own thing and we'll invite those players.

1450
02:00:09,926 --> 02:00:19,074
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see where a particular individual may have PTSD in dealing with legally shaky scenarios involving a certain Japanese company that they would rather not.

1451
02:00:20,655 --> 02:00:31,437
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think that having a competition is not going to cause any... I don't think having a competition is going to necessarily... No, but it should probably be unofficial.

1452
02:00:31,437 --> 02:00:40,699
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that stinks is I don't think Step Maniacs has the distribution where, you know, a lot of folks would be able to compete.

1453
02:00:40,699 --> 02:00:47,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they may be even harder to find than DDR, which is pretty hard to get to already.

1454
02:00:48,360 --> 02:01:17,837
[SPEAKER_01]: unless unless you know the right private collector let me tell you let me some some fans be wild some fans be wild in a good way so anyway all right YYR I appreciate you giving the uh additional perspective on that story and uh so forth yeah SJ100 Matt says we've been educated tonight on DDR happy 19 November everybody uh yeah appropriate time I didn't even notice you you of all people didn't even notice

1455
02:01:19,289 --> 02:01:20,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

1456
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:22,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Guilty.

1457
02:01:22,471 --> 02:01:23,392
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1458
02:01:23,392 --> 02:01:28,795
[SPEAKER_01]: YY, any closing thoughts for us tonight before we let you go?

1459
02:01:28,795 --> 02:01:32,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Please continue to look forward to Super Duper Multitasking.

1460
02:01:32,477 --> 02:01:34,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually nearing completion.

1461
02:01:34,658 --> 02:01:35,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I can say that now.

1462
02:01:35,719 --> 02:01:36,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.

1463
02:01:36,579 --> 02:01:41,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been working very hard on it for like the last six months.

1464
02:01:41,662 --> 02:01:43,263
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have a life as well.

1465
02:01:43,263 --> 02:01:44,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just you.

1466
02:01:44,324 --> 02:01:45,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I get it.

1467
02:01:45,405 --> 02:01:45,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.

1468
02:01:46,641 --> 02:01:50,842
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm working on the new missions now.

1469
02:01:50,842 --> 02:01:52,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are disgustingly hard.

1470
02:01:52,743 --> 02:01:58,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to say, and a baby, but the more I think about it, I'm like, your baby's probably like three or four at this point.

1471
02:01:58,764 --> 02:01:59,985
[SPEAKER_01]: She's five and a half now.

1472
02:01:59,985 --> 02:02:01,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

1473
02:02:01,205 --> 02:02:02,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have I been?

1474
02:02:02,205 --> 02:02:03,466
[SPEAKER_01]: What is time?

1475
02:02:03,466 --> 02:02:11,828
[SPEAKER_05]: She's in kindergarten and she came home last week and she's like, my friend said that she didn't want to be my friend anymore.

1476
02:02:11,828 --> 02:02:13,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's ignoring me on the playground.

1477
02:02:13,789 --> 02:02:14,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, already?

1478
02:02:16,385 --> 02:02:20,587
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only five and you have to go through this already?

1479
02:02:20,587 --> 02:02:21,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's that other kid?

1480
02:02:21,527 --> 02:02:24,188
[SPEAKER_01]: What a bitch.

1481
02:02:24,188 --> 02:02:31,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I think by the end of the week it was all buddy buddy again.

1482
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:40,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, isn't there the general, you know, memory of a cat, you know, 17 minutes and then everything's fine?

1483
02:02:40,874 --> 02:02:41,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about that.

1484
02:02:41,914 --> 02:02:44,495
[SPEAKER_05]: They remember a whole lot that I forget.

1485
02:02:45,537 --> 02:02:48,218
[SPEAKER_05]: He's already like reminded me of stuff.

1486
02:02:48,218 --> 02:02:50,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, on one hand, thank you.

1487
02:02:50,458 --> 02:02:53,339
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the other hand, I felt real dumb.

1488
02:02:53,339 --> 02:02:55,180
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.

1489
02:02:55,180 --> 02:03:05,183
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, YYR, I'm gonna let you go and look forward to all the continued YYR Games releases that you have in the pipeline and realize that good things take time.

1490
02:03:05,183 --> 02:03:06,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't believe me,

1491
02:03:06,863 --> 02:03:09,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at Baldur's Gate 3.

1492
02:03:09,124 --> 02:03:10,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Same approach.

1493
02:03:10,044 --> 02:03:10,304
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1494
02:03:10,304 --> 02:03:12,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair point.

1495
02:03:12,045 --> 02:03:12,325
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1496
02:03:12,325 --> 02:03:13,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks again for the show.

1497
02:03:13,606 --> 02:03:14,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a great week.

1498
02:03:14,146 --> 02:03:14,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1499
02:03:14,586 --> 02:03:15,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, YYR.

1500
02:03:15,326 --> 02:03:16,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for calling.

1501
02:03:16,266 --> 02:03:16,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

1502
02:03:16,647 --> 02:03:17,647
[SPEAKER_01]: See you later.

1503
02:03:17,647 --> 02:03:18,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

1504
02:03:18,987 --> 02:03:22,669
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lovely little present for 19 November here.

1505
02:03:22,669 --> 02:03:25,470
[SPEAKER_01]: And we appreciate YYR giving us a call.

1506
02:03:25,470 --> 02:03:29,851
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I do want to turn it over to any final thoughts.

1507
02:03:29,851 --> 02:03:33,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, before I get to final thoughts, I'm sorry, last minute stories or anything else people want to discuss before we wrap it up.

1508
02:03:36,523 --> 02:03:40,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I don't think I had anything.

1509
02:03:40,546 --> 02:03:42,067
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1510
02:03:42,067 --> 02:03:43,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I actually had one thing.

1511
02:03:43,889 --> 02:03:46,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So Loki, I just I've been kind of multitasking a lot.

1512
02:03:46,651 --> 02:03:48,332
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't really been able to focus.

1513
02:03:48,332 --> 02:03:51,035
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there a reason why the video playing behind you tonight?

1514
02:03:51,035 --> 02:03:53,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just three logos cycling over and over again.

1515
02:03:53,637 --> 02:03:57,100
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't actually show any gameplay for the last two hours.

1516
02:03:57,768 --> 02:04:01,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why it's doing that if it keeps resetting.

1517
02:04:01,290 --> 02:04:02,211
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the Konami.

1518
02:04:02,211 --> 02:04:03,671
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things like I didn't realize.

1519
02:04:03,671 --> 02:04:05,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I just figured, oh, I'm just not looking at the right moments.

1520
02:04:05,613 --> 02:04:09,975
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that, you know, I've been listening to YYR, just kind of like staring and I'm watching the video play behind you.

1521
02:04:09,975 --> 02:04:15,678
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably, it's probably just, like, is it an attract mode that broke?

1522
02:04:15,678 --> 02:04:16,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1523
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:18,060
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's Simpsons Bowling.

1524
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:20,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I see that.

1525
02:04:20,221 --> 02:04:23,463
[SPEAKER_04]: By Konami and Fox Entertainment.

1526
02:04:23,463 --> 02:04:25,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why it's not.

1527
02:04:28,474 --> 02:04:28,554
[SPEAKER_04]: and

1528
02:04:50,450 --> 02:04:56,638
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole point was supposed to be because I couldn't think of something that, you know, correlated with Thanksgiving.

1529
02:04:56,638 --> 02:04:58,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you roll three strikes, what's it called?

1530
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:00,022
[SPEAKER_01]: A turkey.

1531
02:05:00,022 --> 02:05:01,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a big brain reference.

1532
02:05:01,524 --> 02:05:02,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for you.

1533
02:05:02,645 --> 02:05:03,266
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

1534
02:05:03,266 --> 02:05:06,810
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead, it's the Simpsons bowling logo, Konami.

1535
02:05:07,751 --> 02:05:09,294
[SPEAKER_04]: FBI Warning, winners don't use drugs

1536
02:05:23,235 --> 02:05:35,706
[SPEAKER_01]: My Tron machine got a firmware update last week and I was like, ooh, that's cool, a firmware update.

1537
02:05:35,706 --> 02:05:37,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they add new games with these.

1538
02:05:37,608 --> 02:05:38,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it was nothing like that.

1539
02:05:38,929 --> 02:05:44,574
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hey, maybe it's just a minor fix that I don't know what it did or whatever.

1540
02:05:45,154 --> 02:05:49,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to turn on the machine today, and do you know what greets me?

1541
02:05:49,177 --> 02:05:55,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new thing I've never seen before, an advertisement.

1542
02:05:55,741 --> 02:06:00,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcade one up, Black Friday sale going on now with a QR code.

1543
02:06:00,384 --> 02:06:04,427
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that firmware added in the machine, the ability to throw an advertisement.

1544
02:06:05,519 --> 02:06:05,619
[SPEAKER_01]: and

1545
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:28,933
[SPEAKER_01]: after because I was taking a picture and uploading it to social media going what the fuck, blah, blah, blah, except I don't use shitter anymore.

1546
02:06:28,933 --> 02:06:30,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't actually tag arcade one up.

1547
02:06:30,553 --> 02:06:33,715
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can I can still I can still scream into the ether.

1548
02:06:33,715 --> 02:06:36,056
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what people do on the internet very well.

1549
02:06:36,056 --> 02:06:42,378
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was I was posting all that and while I was writing that the screen did go away and it defaulted into attract mode.

1550
02:06:42,378 --> 02:06:45,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that splash does go away after a certain amount of time.

1551
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:48,241
[SPEAKER_01]: But I noticed it and I wasn't happy.

1552
02:06:49,724 --> 02:06:54,970
[SPEAKER_01]: which actually sucks because there are some sales where I'm like, oh, I'm tempted.

1553
02:06:54,970 --> 02:06:58,513
[SPEAKER_01]: But I spent money on shop cards instead.

1554
02:06:58,513 --> 02:07:00,075
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have Mario RPG coming.

1555
02:07:00,075 --> 02:07:02,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.

1556
02:07:02,117 --> 02:07:02,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1557
02:07:03,379 --> 02:07:06,343
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, that's that's good enough for random other topics.

1558
02:07:06,343 --> 02:07:07,864
[SPEAKER_01]: We can move to wrap things up.

1559
02:07:07,864 --> 02:07:10,648
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you all as always for listening to Orange Dance Radio.

1560
02:07:10,648 --> 02:07:14,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope you enjoyed what you heard here tonight.

1561
02:07:14,812 --> 02:07:18,136
[SPEAKER_01]: If you liked what you heard, tell a friend or five about the show, help us spread the word.

1562
02:07:18,136 --> 02:07:21,480
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.

1563
02:07:22,421 --> 02:07:30,666
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify, or wherever it is you heard this podcast go an awful long way.

1564
02:07:30,666 --> 02:07:34,008
[SPEAKER_01]: With all that, I would like to wrap it up.

1565
02:07:34,008 --> 02:07:41,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So also, I want to wish everybody a happy Thanksgiving for those that celebrate here in the States this week.

1566
02:07:41,113 --> 02:07:48,898
[SPEAKER_01]: If nothing else, I hope you have good family time if that's the thing you're into or just catching up on your fucking video game backlog because maybe you don't have to work for a couple days.

1567
02:07:49,398 --> 02:07:54,682
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, let's go to you and your final thought because I'm sure you're going to do some deading by delighting.

1568
02:08:14,802 --> 02:08:26,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I am pretty discouraged by the fact that I can't find a true red bun for my hair because I have to have a fake bun for ballet recital and this is just aggravating.

1569
02:08:26,916 --> 02:08:32,122
[SPEAKER_08]: This means that I've had to buy extensions in the right hair color and make my own damn bun.

1570
02:08:32,122 --> 02:08:34,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I will have my ballerina bun.

1571
02:08:34,985 --> 02:08:35,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

1572
02:08:36,462 --> 02:08:37,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Please send a picture.

1573
02:08:37,583 --> 02:08:49,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I totally learned how to do a pas de chat and I'm very, very happy because a pas de chat is the step of the cat and it is such a cute step and I'm glad I can do one now.

1574
02:08:49,772 --> 02:08:59,219
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of the ballet, I think about how every single year we had to go see the Nutcracker downtown because a girl in our school was in it without fail every single year.

1575
02:08:59,219 --> 02:09:02,141
[SPEAKER_01]: So, DarkSakura, will I ever get to see you in a production of the Nutcracker?

1576
02:09:04,552 --> 02:09:17,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we are doing the flutes from Nutcracker and my you can get a ticket on the set for this for the 17th Maybe I'll see what I'm doing that day So I'll send you a link to it.

1577
02:09:17,801 --> 02:09:31,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't let me forget Okay, also Hanukkah happens before Christmas, so I better get doughnuts damn it All right, just saying all right enjoy I have a good one will do

1578
02:09:33,092 --> 02:09:37,117
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, with that we go to Loki and your final thought tonight.

1579
02:09:37,117 --> 02:09:46,266
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was a Simpsons themed killer in DVD, would it be dead by donut or death by donuts?

1580
02:09:46,266 --> 02:09:47,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead by donuts.

1581
02:09:47,268 --> 02:09:48,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Forbidden donut.

1582
02:09:48,929 --> 02:09:50,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Forbidden donuts.

1583
02:09:50,011 --> 02:09:51,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1584
02:09:51,352 --> 02:09:52,834
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as Homer is the survivor.

1585
02:09:52,834 --> 02:09:53,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1586
02:09:54,852 --> 02:10:17,824
[SPEAKER_01]: uh and my final thought is there was actually a um there was actually i wanted to say a portal but it was actually a pikmin mushroom that we went on that was something like it wasn't forbidden donut but it was like loud pink what was the name of the donut it was something like pink donuts frosted pink donuts and it was these giant i thought it was the cutest uh little picture and postcard i've seen in pikmin bloom yet and i think i sent it to mrs black wolf i think

1587
02:10:19,702 --> 02:10:25,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to have to go back by there to get more postcards because I love the pink donut postcard.

1588
02:10:25,366 --> 02:10:31,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pikmin is always great for exercise and all that good stuff, just not when it's raining.

1589
02:10:31,630 --> 02:10:41,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a very poor job in the weekly challenge this week and had to get carried by the other people in the challenge because it was raining and it's it's a lot of work to go walk in the rain, don't you think?

1590
02:10:41,677 --> 02:10:41,857
