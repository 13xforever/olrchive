10018	14919	As of tomorrow of this recording, your PlayStation controller's share button will get a little less functional.
14919	20901	The network where the hashtag came into prominence no longer plays its birdsong and no longer invites everyone to play in its sandbox.
20901	25162	Microsoft stopped supporting shares to the platform months ago, and now Sony is following suit.
25162	27983	The only good X is the button on video game controllers.
27983	29983	This is the Money Can't Buy Happiness intro.
29983	35144	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Simmers, and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of this week's gaming news.
35144	37365	Starting right now in the show, wherever your gamer has a voice,
39383	41984	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41984	46264	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46264	56607	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live once again tonight with episode number 981 of our show for November the 12th of 2023.
56607	58107	My name is Rob Roberts.
58107	60828	I'm here with you every week as are my co hosts.
60828	62868	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66246	75754	who is not coming through for some reason, but hopefully... I'm not sure what that's all about, but I will jump over and also say hello to TechMasterLuke.
75754	76334	There you go.
76334	77655	Hi, Jamie.
77655	81978	How are you?
81978	84080	Dealing with some business.
84080	84540	Okay.
84540	85441	All right.
85441	89945	Well, I... There's something causing some lag on my system, so it's kind of...
91058	95684	Yeah, well, at least I'm happy to hear your voice is sounding a lot better.
95684	102833	So that seems to indicate that a little bit of therapy with the voice and rest went a long way.
102833	107098	So yeah, as Mike Def says in our chat, good to hear you're doing better now, Jamie.
107098	107559	Absolutely.
109645	113730	So all right, well, we'll also go and say hello to Techmaster Loki.
113730	114812	Hey, Loki.
114812	115473	Hello.
115473	115673	Hi.
115673	116874	How are you doing?
116874	117836	I'm doing pretty good.
117836	118897	All right.
118897	125205	So I'm trying to figure out because, of course, we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice of Geeks Network.
125525	129809	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
129809	133592	And if you do watch us live, you get video that can enhance things a little bit.
133592	142140	I mean, we're mindful that it's a podcast, but we get a little video fun, and I see there's a game playing behind you tonight that kind of looks like the Incredible Machine to me, but it's not.
142140	143041	It's something else.
143041	143721	It is not.
143721	144602	Okay, what is it?
144602	145123	I don't know this one.
145123	146204	It's Ultimate Chicken Horse.
146664	150925	Oh, I don't know this game, but it sounds like it's a fun game.
150925	151585	Yes, it is.
151585	154566	It is a game I did enjoy.
154566	159147	So it's kind of like the Incredible Machine and it's a platformer.
159147	163648	So the object of the game is it's like a four player party game or I think you multi.
163648	173290	I don't know what the limit is, but basically you have a group of people you put down obstacles to either help or hinder yourself to getting to the end.
173290	175671	And the goal is only you get to the end.
178078	182402	And you're trying to stop everybody else from getting to the goal in there.
182402	184945	And if everybody gets to the end, you don't get points.
184945	187828	If some people get to the end, then some people get points.
187828	190590	If everybody gets to the end, then you don't get points.
190590	194714	It's like you have to make it just the right amount difficult.
197676	202837	TheBreakMan in chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network says, A game about screwing your friends?
202837	203998	I'm in.
203998	210220	In the words of Archer, phrasing screwing over your friends like Mario Party.
210220	210620	Yes.
210620	210860	All right.
211300	212662	Perfect.
212662	215965	Okay, I want to get into our first topic tonight.
215965	218548	And this is a little bit like different.
218548	222913	What I'm about to talk about is not like the biggest news story of the week by any means.
222913	227098	But the reason why this is a little bit front of mind for me is because you know, if you go back,
227538	234700	and look at the history of this program, you know, and where we, you know, came from 21 years ago when we started this show in June of 2002.
234700	242182	DarkSakura, myself, Loki, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade.
242182	250784	You know, there's these different mixes of the machine and our local Roseville golf land where we all met had a Dance Dance Revolution USA mix.
250784	256125	And, you know, we wanted to start this show about, you know, the DDR and music game community because
257365	259487	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
274218	277399	Yeah, and the first and the first day I was able to actually meet Jamie.
277399	281079	So, you know, lots of good memories going way back.
281079	297683	And, you know, we've been, you know, and for many years, this show was really about music games and primarily Konami's Bamani, you know, Beatmania, the original music game, which was actually before DDR and their whole series and, you know, the fandom and tournaments.
298163	300385	was a big, big part of what we used to talk about.
300385	305849	In fact, we broadcast live from a tournament at Pier 39 in San Francisco.
305849	312794	It was a big deal for us, you know, in the early days of internet radio, because that would have been about like 2003 when we did that, if you think about it.
312794	319039	It was kind of a big deal, a lot of fun, you know, and these DDR tournaments are really about community and getting to talk to people.
319039	321180	And that's what the show is all about.
321180	324543	So I think that's why when I heard about this story this week,
325083	327164	This resonated with me a little bit.
327164	330326	So what's going on?
330326	333108	There's still DDR, you know, DDR has been having a resurgence.
333108	338351	I should probably say this is that I don't want to say we ever fell out of love of DDR.
338351	348278	But I think because we saw a long period of time, you know, when we did the show, what DDR Max 2 was like the new mix, and then Extreme came out.
348658	352702	And then we had a little bit of a period where like they were releasing home versions pretty regularly.
352702	362390	They started to really pick up the US presence on the home versions with, you know, the Xbox versions and, you know, the PlayStation, you know, Extreme and Extreme 2, you know, some of those things.
362390	374681	So we had a lot to talk about, but then things started to dry out a little bit because it felt like Konami did not really have the faith or the risk to continue to produce
375342	379065	DDR games and new music games for quite some time.
379065	384709	They took a little bit of a break, and by them taking a break, it caused other music games to rise up.
384709	391194	That's when Guitar Hero happened, and Rock Band, and the rise of all that stuff.
391194	395818	And of course, a lot of that then led to, now Konami's back in the business, right?
396318	403802	And thanks to, you know, Japanese arcades and these partnerships with places like Round One or even, you know, places like Dave & Buster's still getting machines.
403802	407644	We've had, you know, calls on this show kind of talk about the status of all that.
407644	409906	You know, we still have DDR today.
409906	420712	And it's really interesting, because we've been able to watch a whole new and, you know, not to be the old man on the chair, but kind of a little bit, we've been able to watch a whole new generation of folks
421232	426795	come up that really love this series and really love these music games and have that fandom.
426795	434319	Ironically, there are now podcasts about Bomani and music games at this point, which is funny.
434319	437801	We stepped away from that and shifted our focus to video games because
438141	441702	for a long period of time, there wasn't any Bomani news.
441702	443823	We didn't have anything to talk about for quite some time.
443823	445464	It was very, very minimal.
445464	449525	And we kind of decided, you know what, we're more like video games first.
449525	451026	Those are 40 years in the desert.
451026	451926	Yeah, yeah.
451926	459009	And so it's neat to see the resurgence, and it's neat to see all of this come back again.
459009	464251	But what's not neat to see is Konami's playing their same old tricks.
465222	465682	and Konami.
482406	488594	There's this big tournament called KAC, which is the Konami Arcade Championships.
488594	494982	And DDR, of course, is one of the games that is going to be represented in these championships.
494982	497585	And there is a very prominent DDR player
498106	501969	from North America, who goes by the name Chris4Life.
501969	507553	And you've probably seen him, you know, in tournaments, you know, a couple years ago, and so forth.
507553	510895	There's other, you know, great AAA players too, as well.
510895	511676	Please forgive me.
511676	515238	I don't follow the series as much as I used to, so I don't know all of your names.
515238	519421	But I know that there are a lot of people that are super, you know, into DDR, very good at it.
519421	522263	In fact, Chris4Life is known as really one of the best.
522263	523084	Very, very good.
523084	524465	Wins championships, right?
525305	533031	So he and some of his other, you know, AAA playing friends want to join the Konami Arcade Championships.
533031	533952	But here's the problem.
534892	539495	They got essentially kicked out of registering for Konami Arcade Championships.
539495	539936	Why?
539936	545039	Because in order to qualify for the championships, you have to play certain qualifier songs.
545039	551364	But to play those songs, your account has to have access to what's called PSELE.
551364	556187	To have access to this, your account's residence has to be in Japan.
556187	559450	And so your account's residence must match your real residence.
559870	574092	And so you can't have you know, and you can't do like several accounts and this type because I guess I think somebody else actually did this this other player Nate, Nat8 or something like that was disqualified for having one account in Japan and it didn't match the actual residence.
575379	582642	And sure enough, Chris wrote on his Twitter account, I was disqualified from KAC as were my fellow American DDR players.
582642	589805	Last week, each of us received emails from Konami asking us to explain our KAC entries because they were in jeopardy of being invalidated.
589805	598849	I explained our situation to them and made it known that the rules for entry this year were set up in a way that made it impossible for any non-Japanese player to submit a valid entry.
599847	604250	I've included the email transcripts below for full transparency.
604250	614938	I hope that next year Konami doesn't plan to give us the same runaround, but if they do, I sincerely hope they save us all the trouble and just say, KAC is Japan only from the beginning.
614938	618541	And I think that's a very important thing to note.
618541	624666	If the Konami Arcade Championships had just said up front, this is only open to residents of Japan, this wouldn't be a problem.
625560	627263	They're not doing that.
627263	633573	And from where I'm sitting, they're trying to give the perception that this is a global tournament.
633573	636898	And now they've got these silly rules because, again,
638035	641356	And this just goes back to what pissed me off about Konami years ago.
641356	649338	Konami isn't willing to invest in the audience over here the way that they are the audience in Japan.
649338	656140	And we live in this global economy now, especially with round one, importing these machines and having these deals.
657060	659701	Why are we not getting the same experience?
659701	673346	Why are folks banned from these tournaments because of these workarounds that they have to work around because Konami just won't fucking set up the game like every other company sets up the game?
673346	678728	OrangeRide also points out they had a rule that you have to speak conversational Japanese.
678728	681409	They eventually got rid of it, and then they did this.
682631	686573	Again, if you want to limit it to Japan, just limit it to Japan.
686573	697258	But instead, and I love that Chris did this, honestly, is that Chris pasted these emails and said, here you go, for full transparency, here is what happened.
697258	700219	Now, I'm not going to read the entire thing.
700219	703381	But basically Konami sent a message to Chris that said,
704221	708944	We were informed from a post on social networking that you entered with more than one account.
708944	714207	If this is true, your entry will be invalidated and you'll forfeit your right to participate in the finals.
714207	715568	I'm summarizing a little bit.
715568	722572	If you want to read all these again, you can check out Chris's Twitter account at chrs4lfe.
722572	727515	And again, my policy, yes, it is still called Twitter and it will always be called Twitter.
727515	731458	Unless you are a sponsor on Sesame Street, your company is not a letter.
731458	731778	Thank you.
733344	741689	Anyway, so Chris writes this email back and basically explains what's going on, the same thing I just outlined a little bit ago.
741689	749693	Konami writes back, and this is the part where my fucking head explodes, reading this.
749693	752435	This is so tacky and terrible, this response.
753407	758531	Dear Chris, This is Konami Arcade Championship Operations Team from Konami Amusement.
758531	760553	Thank you very much for your response.
760553	769761	After further examination of your response, you have been decided to be disqualified in accordance with the entry requirements and you will not be allowed to participate in the final round.
769761	771842	We appreciate your understanding.
771842	775966	We hope you will continue to patronize Konami's amusement products in the future.
781711	785474	Uh, it, that's just stupid.
785474	787135	There's no understanding.
787135	790917	And it's like, it's like, yeah, sucks to be you.
790917	796121	And, but you continue to purchase our products and player products.
796121	800484	Like, is it who who's been winning these tournaments in KAC?
800484	804066	Like, I'm just wondering if it's like a thing where, oh, hey,
805011	807372	The US is coming in stomping.
807372	810093	And so they're like, Oh, well, this is making us look bad.
810093	817477	You know, we're gonna limit it to only Japan only but in a roundabout way that's stupid.
817477	819378	I mean, is that what the landscape looks like?
819378	820038	I don't know.
820038	822519	I mean, otherwise, it's just dumb.
822519	825061	Well, DarkSakura, you bring you say something interesting in chat.
825061	826902	You're saying it's a copy paste response.
826902	828422	So I doubt it was a personal attack.
828422	831664	I don't necessarily think it was a personal attack either.
831664	833705	But it was some real shit customer service.
835794	837396	It's just how Japanese companies are.
837396	840658	I mean, the end of the, please look forward to it.
840658	844582	Or, you know, please say, you know, our thing.
844582	850287	It's, it's just gotten emails like that too, from other Japanese companies.
850287	854771	So I, I don't think it was intended to be.
856246	858509	No, I like tone deaf or something.
858509	859931	I don't think that was its intention.
859931	863335	I think it was just a translation and a copy paste.
863335	871725	But it does, which is probably what any end of service email that goes out from most companies in Japan will end with.
872486	874107	It's just how it is.
874107	875468	It's not anything.
875468	876868	I feel zero over that.
876868	882831	But DJRamaS brings up a good follow-up to this saying, the email sounds like they didn't even read the initial response.
882831	891236	And considering this guy is a world champion, it just shows this complete obliviousness to the whole situation.
891236	897399	And I think the thing that pisses me off about it, yeah, it might be like, you know, okay, this is what they do or whatever, but it just
897899	899000	It just reeks of shit.
899000	899700	I'm sorry.
899700	901261	It just, it brings me back.
901261	904363	And maybe this is why I was so enraged when I read this.
904363	911869	It just brings me back to 20 years ago, where it just felt like consistently Konami in Japan does not give a shit about us.
911869	914911	So why do we continue to support them?
914911	917092	Why?
917092	918093	I don't know sometimes.
919221	938976	And like, especially when I thought Konami was on this path to like improving themselves, you know, through some of the announcements from the Silent Hill thing, and you know, the relative, well, the Castlevania collection has been in the old school, you know, arcade collection has been and so forth.
941539	942239	Oh, interesting.
942239	943340	I didn't realize this.
943340	953184	OrangeRite says the top ranking player in Korea, FeFemz, got a special invite to KAC and says he's not going.
953184	956046	Good on that person for taking that stance there.
956046	957286	Well, how did he get in?
957286	959908	I thought you had to have... I thought you had to live in Japan.
959908	960868	Thank you.
960868	961408	Thank you.
961408	961989	See, exactly.
961989	964890	This is why, like, I don't want to like... Is there a special invitation?
966024	967544	Well, here's what I'm saying.
967544	978808	Like, I feel like, I don't want to sound, like, entitled, but I'm just wondering if it's like some sort of, not, I don't think it's reverse racism or anything like that, but it's like, it's a silly rule, first off.
978808	982329	I'm not, I'm not, here, I'm not gonna assume anything from Konami.
982329	983989	Konami's just poorly run.
983989	986210	It's just what it is.
986210	994092	So, I'm just gonna assume that they put these rules in place and they didn't think about the consequences of it.
995379	996199	Maybe.
996199	999140	I don't know.
999140	1000701	It's in-group versus out-group.
1000701	1004082	It's how the whole society is structured.
1004082	1006462	It's your in-group versus your out-group.
1006462	1015665	And if you're not part of the intended group, then you just sort of get kind of pushed away and forgotten about.
1020294	1025077	It's a very different type of thing to, it's two different mindsets.
1025077	1027819	And we are looking at this from a very Western mindset.
1027819	1039526	I'm going to say this just, it's not just that I'm playing devil's advocate, but I think that we're also looking through this through very Western cultural lenses.
1039526	1048971	We are a lot more, we include, it's, it's, you know, everyone from, I mean, well, we say that we do that, but people are still very, you know,
1051618	1058425	was sort of thinking of exclusionist over here, but but Japan is very homogenous as a country.
1058425	1059526	And it's always been that way.
1060653	1075242	and change over the... I watch a lot of actual non-Japanese ethnic people who were born and grew up in Japan who experience this on a daily basis because they don't appear to be Japanese.
1075242	1078463	It's just how the culture is.
1078463	1080865	And I'm not saying that it's right or wrong.
1080865	1089430	It's just we're looking at these through, you know, American lenses and we need to have a broader view of it.
1091325	1098151	I think Konami needs to have a broader view of it when they want the Western dollars and the business over here.
1098151	1102174	And here's now what some of this has led to.
1102174	1110400	And I want to be very careful how I approach this because Chris is being very vulnerable in this post on Twitter, and I don't want to sensationalize it or anything like that.
1110760	1115623	But obviously, you know, these sorts of things can one thing can lead to another.
1115623	1122147	And you know, Chris wrote this very long post that and starts off by saying this isn't about being disqualified from KAC.
1122147	1124208	That was just the cherry on top.
1124208	1131392	It's running much deeper than that and kind of basically goes on to talking about he's not in a great place mentally right now.
1131392	1136075	That this is this is the everything that's happened really has taken a toll.
1139016	1151344	I dedicated over half of my entire life to DDR, and I feel like such a fool admitting that, because it's become extraordinarily clear that Konami couldn't care less about us or anything we've done with the game by banning us from KAC.
1152305	1156989	I have 18,000 plays on DDR which means I've spent at least $18,000 supporting their game.
1156989	1167697	I also didn't once think that the people around me that I love will eventually move on from these things, leaving me alone with nothing but the high scores I dedicated myself to achieving and a life I had no plans for.
1167697	1170619	So what was it all even for?
1170619	1174722	And sums up by saying, I realized I need to find myself again, even though I don't know how yet.
1174722	1175923	It's nice being Chris for life.
1176283	1177704	but it can't be everything anymore.
1177704	1187891	I need to discover rediscover the meaning of being his real name, something someone whose life is defining qualities, experiences, and will still have meaning if when rhythm games aren't there anymore.
1187891	1191373	It's the only way I'll ever be truly happy in the end.
1191373	1205142	And you know, that's a heck of a wake up call in some ways to have and I feel for the guy and again, I'm wanting to really be careful here not to sensationalize this and just like said nothing but like, love and support Chris's way through this whole thing.
1205142	1205282	And
1207583	1221047	But I think it does go to show how a passing interaction like that can really have this effect where now he's like, it's almost like that person that's been working for a company years and years and years and gets laid off.
1221047	1223467	And it's like, well, where the hell's that loyalty?
1223467	1227188	And then it's like, surprise, companies don't have loyalty.
1227188	1230869	And I think that's the realization a lot of people are having about Konami.
1230869	1233610	They're just another fucking money sucking
1234150	1241036	company that cares about fucking profits and just cares about the dollars and they don't fucking care about you.
1241036	1243919	They don't care about your Twitter posts promoting their game.
1243919	1245881	They don't care about this show.
1245881	1248083	Actually, I'm going to dial it back.
1248083	1253007	When there was offices in the States, there was more of that sort of caring.
1253007	1256210	So Konami now doesn't care about this type of stuff.
1256210	1258932	And Konami, like Konami doesn't care about you.
1259741	1260941	Period.
1260941	1267223	So whatever you want to chalk that up to, or any of that stuff, that's what it is.
1267223	1270925	So, Philof9 says, do any companies care?
1270925	1271285	I don't know.
1271285	1279547	I'm starting to question because, you know, just last week we were talking about a company that laid off people and most of it happened to be their community management folks.
1279547	1284249	Most gaming companies have community management teams.
1284249	1286930	I'm going to tell you who obviously does not have this.
1290509	1294191	I think you can also figure it out.
1294191	1300575	S2100mat points out, I don't know if they'll do it this year, but I know a lot of the top 100 players try to fly out for the KAC anyways.
1300575	1303377	They run a community tournament outside of KAC at a local arcade.
1303377	1304738	That tournament is awesome.
1304738	1305378	Really cool.
1305378	1308380	And honestly, the Riola tournament, I hope they do it again.
1308380	1315464	Yeah, let's I honestly, I'm I am right back on the fuck Konami train.
1315464	1317085	I am right back on that train.
1317085	1318907	And it's I'm, I'm reminded
1319935	1333049	I'm reminded, because I relate everything in my life to RuPaul's Drag Race, I'm reminded of this Untucked from All Stars 1 that is awfully legendary, that shows Mimi, I'm First, you know, having kind of a meltdown.
1333049	1341597	And there's a cutaway to Chad Michaels that goes, you know, just when I thought she turned over a new leaf, there she is, the same old Mimi.
1342418	1359976	That's really what I'm thinking about this situation is that oh man I thought Konami was on this path to like fixing things and getting better and then oh the Silent Hill game comes out and it's it's Silent Hill Ascension's a fucking mess and then this happens and I'm like up there she is same old Konami.
1362426	1375916	I think a lot of people that support DDR continuing in this day and are dropping dollars in the machines and that whole thing really have a lot of stuff to question this week.
1375916	1391487	I thank Chris for being vulnerable in that post and saying the things that he had to say, because I think there's a lot of people, in some ways myself included, that need to evaluate some of the loyalty to that stuff.
1395389	1397872	Step Maniacs is a really cool dance game.
1412608	1413248	going to ballet.
1430973	1436057	So anyway, uh, yeah, I'm sorry to start off the show with what is essentially a bit of a bummer.
1436057	1448306	But I just I was thrown back to I was having a headline like it's 2003 up in here on OLR 20 years ago, it just it just felt like that to me.
1448306	1450428	There she is the same old Konami.
1451957	1459020	Well, let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and see if it's the same old games that we've been playing this week or maybe some new games.
1459020	1460421	DarkSakura, we'll go to you first.
1460421	1463902	How was your gaming week?
1463902	1469265	I started Retro Knight, but I'm not going to say what it is because it's a classic game.
1469265	1469465	Okay.
1470410	1473172	So I'll leave it there.
1473172	1476255	I, of course, played some Dead by Daylight.
1476255	1480639	I had a funny thing happen when I was just testing to see if my voice was well enough.
1480639	1486204	I played four games with a newer friend I've made through the game.
1486204	1489487	They were a Huntress in our match.
1489487	1493730	And I played four games.
1493730	1495232	Killer let me out all four games.
1496837	1498338	Three hatches and one door.
1498338	1503701	And the only reason I got the door was because I was a stubborn Meg.
1503701	1508664	Was that the Huntress you got in back-to-back games?
1508664	1509764	Aunt Honey?
1509764	1510385	I don't remember.
1510385	1517069	I was lurking in the channel and I remember you and Fixie were freaking out because you had the same killer in back-to-back games that you really liked.
1517069	1521591	That was a spirit that Fixie got in the game and then I joined in and we got the same spirit.
1521591	1522512	Okay, okay.
1522512	1523232	That's when I was lurking.
1523232	1524473	It was just cool with us.
1527968	1533412	I did a bunch of Dreamlight Valley today.
1533412	1541359	That's what I've been playing in my downtime while I haven't felt well is just a buttload of Dreamlight Valley and some Cult of the Lamb.
1547392	1549753	Yeah, that's it.
1549753	1570161	I mean, I'll pick up and play like a couple of little, like, I played some SNES stuff and I'm actually trying to talk myself out of dropping $40 on a VST for Logic Pro that's basically the entire Super Famicom sound synthesizer.
1570161	1572122	Oops.
1572122	1573462	I'm talking myself out of it.
1573462	1574263	I got other things to do.
1575816	1577056	All right, Loki, we'll go to you.
1577056	1578677	How was your gaming week?
1578677	1579897	My gaming week was pretty good.
1579897	1585579	I played Ultimate Chicken Horse, of course, with some of the people on Channel 64.
1585579	1588600	So that was kind of fun to check out that game.
1588600	1591561	And then, you know, Minecraft.
1591561	1595703	I've been doing some of the stuff still on Ravesworks server.
1595703	1599044	And today we did the dragon fight with wardens everywhere.
1599044	1600404	So that was fun.
1600404	1604826	So that'll be in a video episode or two from now.
1605587	1608450	Um, but yeah, pretty much it.
1608450	1609170	Alright, thanks.
1609170	1611032	Uh, my gaming week.
1611032	1614174	Of course, lots of Diablo 4 still going on this season.
1614174	1616616	I hit level 69 today.
1616616	1617617	Nice.
1617617	1619679	Um, and... Nice.
1619679	1620339	Nice.
1620339	1628846	Um, but that also means that my, uh, character has out-leveled my Eternal and Season 1 characters as well, so that's fun.
1628846	1632069	Uh, also I learned the hard way, if you're recording things for YouTube,
1632569	1659574	um shut off trade chat because i actually recorded a video for my channel so i've been like like half-assing youtube on my personal channel like i'll fully admit i've been capturing gameplay when i don't have like the spoons for extraversion to like be on camera and talk it through and so forth like i've just been recording some game like i had like a theater than video last week with all the final fantasy 16 stuff and i did a diablo 4 when i did the world tier 3 unlock and i record one today for the world tier 4 unlock
1660054	1667560	but I haven't been able to post it yet because I have to go back and put in the YouTube blur because TradeChat decided to start piping up with just
1668436	1675900	all the crap that I was like, man, what a hard lesson learned that I forgot to leave trade chat because usually it's quiet in there.
1675900	1681524	But then people decide to start acting foolish in there and saying things that aren't appropriate to repeat.
1681524	1690029	And yeah, but anyway, yeah, if you want to, my YouTube is actually Rob Roberts plays, because I think Rob Roberts like makes guns or something.
1690029	1691309	So don't don't follow that channel.
1691309	1693250	But Rob Roberts plays on YouTube.
1693250	1697033	But again, admittedly, I'm not like super trying to grow my YouTube presence.
1697033	1697493	It's just like,
1697895	1705022	when I just feel like I have this 4K capture card and a nice computer and I feel like I'm not recording any like really pretty gameplay from it.
1705022	1706723	So I'm just trying to do that a little more often.
1706723	1708064	So that's all.
1708064	1712288	Yeah, so I did some Diablo 4 over there.
1712288	1714850	And gosh, what else have I played this week?
1714850	1716432	Just a little bit of Dead by Daylight.
1716432	1717953	Not a lot, but just a little bit.
1717953	1720436	I think I also played a little bit of Warcraft Classic.
1720916	1721957	just a little bit of that.
1721957	1723858	Oh, I know what I played this week.
1723858	1724919	That's fun.
1724919	1727601	So N7 day was this week, right?
1727601	1730804	Where you know, we got a trailer for a game.
1730804	1731824	Well, not even a trailer.
1731824	1734206	We got a whisper.
1734206	1736228	We got a we got a trick.
1736228	1736968	We didn't get a trailer.
1736968	1745775	We got a trick because we got a whisper of what the next Mass Effect game might look like a game we're not going to be playing till 2026 at the earliest.
1745775	1749578	So you know, whatever they're continuing to tease that and this is like,
1749818	1751058	It looks cool.
1751058	1757121	I guess but I'm just I think about a game like Final Fantasy 13 or excuse me, Final Fantasy 15.
1757121	1760122	I almost said 13 versus because that's what that game was.
1760122	1763343	And I think about how the thing Yeah, I think about how we'll go.
1763343	1765524	But seriously, if you've played and beat 15
1766724	1772728	go back and watch a trailer for 13 Versus, and you'll be like, what the fuck is this game?
1772728	1776671	It's like the same characters, but this is not the same game.
1776671	1782294	And so I just have this bad feeling, you know, Mass Effect's probably gonna change a lot before it comes out.
1782294	1783635	And it's, it's fine.
1783635	1785476	But that's why I'm just like, okay, I'll
1786397	1792861	hype train will wait until they have a release date that's like within a year, then I'll start buying into the hype.
1792861	1800605	But my point is, because it was in seven day, one of my friends was like, we should play Mass Effect three.
1800605	1801206	And I was like,
1801886	1805128	Oh my God, are the multiplayer servers even still running for that game?
1805128	1806129	And yes, they are.
1806129	1807390	And yes, we did.
1807390	1809051	We know we know what?
1809051	1809331	Yeah.
1809331	1811893	The servers for Mass Effect 3 PC are still up.
1811893	1815236	And I was like, I actually had to think I was like, where's my origin?
1815236	1816917	Because I had to download.
1816917	1818618	There's not even origin anymore, by the way.
1818618	1819959	They closed that years ago.
1819959	1822901	So I had to download like the EA thing, install that.
1822901	1826303	And yes, you can still play Mass Effect 3 on PC.
1826303	1829646	And I think a lot of the randos are in gold and platinum.
1830126	1854969	but we went into a bronze we cleared a bronze I was so happy I was like it y'all it took me a minute to remember how to fucking play Mass Effect but then I finally remembered okay with my Corian tech all I have to do freeze explode freeze explode freeze explode I finally was like okay I can get through a bronze that was fun because honestly I hadn't played Mass Effect 3 since I had the Krogan oh go ahead
1857113	1860515	I remember I had that Krogan named Rex in effect after the band.
1860515	1861635	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1861635	1862236	No, it's fun.
1862236	1864757	Yeah, it was fun seeing all my old characters and stuff.
1864757	1868579	And it looked the nice thing is because I hadn't played it on my newer computer.
1868579	1871180	Y'all know I got a new computer about a year and a half ago.
1871180	1873162	And I was able to play it in like 2k.
1873162	1876023	And I was like, dang, this looks nice.
1876023	1877044	So that was really fun.
1877044	1877564	So yeah.
1878264	1880587	It was fun to venture back and check out Mass Effect 3.
1880587	1883329	That was my N7 day, was reliving the good old days.
1883329	1885091	And there was so much I couldn't remember.
1885091	1887033	I was like, what does this rating mean?
1887033	1888334	Why do prestige characters?
1888334	1889595	What do you get for prestige?
1889595	1891778	There was so much I couldn't remember.
1891778	1893839	So anyway, it was good times.
1894820	1900585	Questbuster in chat says, I miss Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but I remember enjoying it enough to unlock more characters.
1900585	1906010	Yeah, I oh my God, that's the reason why I bought Mass Effect 3 like four times.
1906010	1908612	You all give me so much shit for buying Mass Effect 3 four times.
1908612	1913316	That's why I did it was for multiplayer.
1913316	1914837	All right.
1914837	1916739	Well, with that, that's our gaming weeks.
1916739	1921343	So let's get into some news and what is going on around the game industry this week.
1921343	1922664	And we will start with Loki.
1924244	1935967	All right, so Nintendo has been trying to fight off rumors about their next console, which we know is coming, I mean, obviously.
1935967	1943769	But of course, you know, there's also litigation going on with other companies, you know, like Activision and Epic and all that stuff.
1943769	1946710	And because of all of that.
1946710	1950671	You know, stuff is kind of leaked out, per se, so.
1953223	1969235	So of course, with that, a Japanese outlet, Mainichi, has reported that apparently Nintendo has showcased their devices to partners at public events and private meetings with different companies.
1969235	1979202	But there's also the FTC versus Microsoft court case that also leaked out information regarding that it's been shown to Activision.
1981123	1984005	because obviously they were looking to purchase Activision.
1984005	1989026	So that information came out from that with the court documents.
1989026	1990027	So we know it's coming.
1990027	1994028	I mean, obviously it's probably next year at some point.
1994028	1998950	We just, you know, it'll be like the Switch, you know, where they announce it like beginning of the year, it comes out in March.
1998950	2001091	So we'll just have to wait and see.
2002881	2009323	And it would be silly to think Nintendo isn't working on something, just like Sony is absolutely working on PlayStation 6.
2009323	2010583	Everybody is.
2010583	2014324	They are working on everything.
2014324	2019325	Well, especially with Mainichi, though, going to the source.
2019325	2022246	Isn't that right?
2022246	2023586	Yeah, I mean, for sure.
2023586	2028808	I think also, you know, with the core documents and everything, it's, you know, pretty much in
2029969	2030329	in the comments.
2044778	2044798	I
2061084	2062225	Not the Game Awards.
2062225	2063265	For sure not.
2063265	2064446	Get that thought out of your head.
2064446	2066527	There will not be a new Switch at the Game Awards.
2066527	2068688	There's no reason for Nintendo to do that.
2068688	2073011	No, they will not do that because they want the eyes all on them.
2073011	2076953	So they will do their own unveiling of that somehow.
2076953	2078754	But it's not going to be on the Game Awards.
2078754	2081616	The Game Awards is probably going to have other things that are significant.
2081616	2083697	But yeah.
2083697	2086458	Something we'll get to later in the show that seems certain.
2086458	2086678	Yeah.
2088393	2096502	All right, well, something that is doing new hardware, and we know that this is a thing that is confirmed because there's a whole website about it.
2096502	2097944	It's a new Steam Deck.
2097944	2099305	Well, new-ish.
2099305	2101308	It's not like a hardware refresh.
2101308	2102709	It's more of a visual refresh.
2102709	2105713	It's the Steam Deck OLED.
2105713	2107315	The Steam Deck OLED.
2107315	2108916	Sorry, Nintendo.
2108916	2109397	I'm sorry, Jamie?
2111138	2112999	They're pulling a Nintendo.
2112999	2113440	Oh, yeah.
2113440	2115101	Like how the Switch made an OLED.
2115101	2116182	Yeah, right.
2116182	2116923	Yeah.
2116923	2119805	Steam is making an OLED version as well, for sure.
2119805	2125529	And it's coming out on November 16th and it will start for $549.
2125529	2130033	It's going to feature an OLED screen with a larger picture, better battery life, faster Wi-Fi.
2130033	2132335	Of course, these are all the nice marketing words.
2132335	2134817	But I am hearing the screen is very nice.
2134817	2136278	And this was one of the things that people
2137138	2143522	I feel like for the most part, people really did enjoy the original Steam Deck, but the screen was maybe one of those things people said could be improved.
2143522	2144703	And, you know, that's it.
2144703	2148746	By making an OLED screen, that is certainly doing it.
2148746	2158952	So this will also make the battery life longer with this, and downloads are supposed to be faster, I think, through some of the Wi-Fi, because it's Wi-Fi 6E that is going to be in there.
2158952	2160593	So that's pretty cool.
2160593	2163955	Also, a different fan and some different thermal stuff.
2164655	2167757	It's gonna run a little bit lighter as well.
2167757	2169558	So yeah, it looks really cool.
2169558	2183346	It is not an improvement on speed or that sort of hardware, so you can't really call this a full refresh or a Steam Deck 2, but this is definitely like the pinnacle of what the Steam Deck first generation is gonna be.
2183346	2187128	I have to admit, I'm a little bit tempted, but I think I'm gonna
2188049	2193974	I'm gonna hold out and try to wait for them to eventually do a hardware refresh, which I'm sure will happen at some point.
2195802	2202545	You can still get the LCD screen, 256 gigabyte Steam Deck if you want for $399.
2202545	2206907	The $549 is for a 512 gigabyte OLED.
2206907	2219072	If you want to spend premium dollars, you can get the $679 limited edition 1 terabyte OLED, which is it's pretty much the same thing, but with a 1 terabyte drive.
2219072	2221153	And you get what do you get?
2221153	2223394	A limited edition carrying case.
2223394	2223534	Ooh.
2224614	2228577	an exclusive startup movie and virtual keyboard theme.
2228577	2229237	Ooh.
2229237	2237643	Ah, but I guess that'll probably be alluring to some people, but the one terabyte in storage is certainly going to be very welcome as well on that.
2237643	2239484	So, all right.
2239484	2244387	Um, let's go ahead and move on to our next story, which a lot of people are talking about this week.
2244387	2247249	Right, right, Jimmy.
2247249	2249711	And this comes directly from Nintendo.
2249711	2251592	Um, actually, uh, Nintendo of Japan.
2253687	2261770	They are working on the development of a live-action Legend of Zelda film.
2261770	2267632	The representative director and president, Shuntaro Furukawa,
2270193	2274075	on behalf of Nintendo has announced that it's developing the film.
2274075	2276956	It will be produced by Miyamoto.
2276956	2284220	It will be produced by Avi Arad, who is the chairman of Arad Productions.
2284220	2286421	Done a bunch of films.
2286421	2288642	And it's going to be directed by Wes Ball.
2288642	2294725	It is co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures, although more than 50% of it is financed by Nintendo.
2295525	2299210	and it will be distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures.
2299210	2308522	So, um, there's not really a whole lot about this, just that, um, it's going to happen.
2309488	2311250	They've got names on it.
2311250	2313532	Nintendo is behind the design.
2313532	2316214	So cool.
2316214	2321058	And it's interesting because the first thing almost everybody wants to jump to is casting.
2321058	2324901	And people are like, Oh, well, it's gonna be Tom Holland that plays Link.
2324901	2329846	And oh, I look forward to Chris-san, you know, joining as Link.
2329846	2332128	Timothee Chalamet or whatever as Link.
2332128	2335491	And I'm like, the actors you are all naming are too old.
2336584	2340526	And that is wild for me to say, but that is realistic.
2340526	2342827	The actors you all are naming are too old.
2342827	2349871	It's going to be somebody you probably haven't heard of, or maybe has been in one or two things.
2349871	2352253	It's going to have to be somebody who is
2353936	2362959	It's going to be, I would say, younger 20s, or the time they start filming.
2362959	2370221	So, I would, if they've just made this announcement, they probably are just through mostly concepts and scripting.
2371261	2376023	or not even scripting, just, you know, screenplay touch up, I would imagine at this point.
2376023	2381045	So, yeah, there's nothing that any kind of speculation help with.
2381045	2382246	Yeah.
2382246	2389389	The timing of this announcement is interesting because they did if I'm not mistaken, they did wait until like the day after the actor strike was resolved.
2389389	2389549	Right.
2389549	2392070	Which, by the way, the actor strike did get resolved this week.
2392070	2392931	Y'all hadn't heard.
2392931	2394211	So that is exciting news.
2395992	2397513	as long as the actors got a fair deal.
2397513	2400034	Apparently, some are still taking issue with some of the AI provisions.
2400034	2404396	I know some people in SAG-AFTRA that are not happy with AI provisions.
2404396	2412699	But, you know, for the most part, they certainly got a better deal than they were being the last and final offer they got the first time.
2412699	2413900	So I guess that's good.
2413900	2414960	But it is interesting.
2414960	2423284	So you kind of wonder how much work has been happening behind the scenes while the strike was going on that now they're coming kind of coming out and announcing this now, which is interesting.
2427929	2433704	This is live action, so I doubt you're gonna see the voice actors.
2435171	2447121	come in any kind of on-screen role unless they are a complete and utter physical, identical, hit the age, blah, blah, blah, all of the visual stuff that they look for on a big production.
2447121	2447941	Yeah.
2447941	2448562	I would agree.
2448562	2453726	You're not going to see... A cameo is usually what you're going to get in this situation.
2453726	2458430	You're going to get a cameo maybe, but I wouldn't hold out for that.
2460511	2465034	I would say if they do, I kind of feel like an unknown ultimately is going to be Link.
2465034	2469936	And so the speculation about who's going to be cast, I'm sure there's already a million YouTubes trying to figure that out.
2469936	2475419	I'm like, it's meaningless because I really think a unknown is ultimately going to get the part.
2475419	2477381	That's the reality.
2477381	2488227	But I do think if they put a well-known actor in the project, probably in the role of Ganon, because I feel like that's something they can
2489167	2491590	TigerKlaw on chat says it'll be known actors.
2491590	2492390	You sure of that?
2500916	2509882	because it's pretty common that unknown actors get cast in some big projects or things that maybe you don't know them as well yet.
2509882	2515667	Like somebody like Jennifer Lawrence, when she got The Hunger Games, wasn't super, super well known.
2515667	2520430	Or here's a better, Daniel Radcliffe, when he got cast as Harry Potter, right?
2520430	2522892	That was like a nationwide search type of thing, right?
2522892	2524153	He's very famous now.
2524813	2530015	But when he was cast as Harry Potter, which granted was an 11 year old kid at the time, he wasn't very well known.
2530015	2538539	So I, I do feel like, you know, it might be somebody from like a Netflix show or somebody that's done one or two little things.
2538539	2546882	Um, but I don't think it's going to be anybody, you know, but they could throw somebody, you know, into one of the other roles like Ganon or, or something else.
2546882	2548003	It'd be very, very interesting.
2549434	2550335	Ooh, I like this.
2550335	2555780	Questbuster in chat says, I'd like to see them pull a Tim Curry-like move with Ganon.
2555780	2560204	I believe referring to the movie Legend and Darkness and all that.
2560204	2563867	Make people do a double take and be like, OMG, they were Ganon?
2563867	2565068	That would be pretty cool.
2565068	2565488	But anyway.
2566149	2571572	I don't want to participate in too much speculation here because this is a long, long ways off.
2571572	2575414	But I think most people are just excited that like, yeah, it's happening.
2575414	2583478	And the fact that it's live action, I think is a huge thing for some people, because I think many people were expecting, it'll probably be animated.
2583478	2589161	Just because, you know, it'll be it'll be easier for them to, you know, get the essence of it.
2589161	2591222	So it'll be interesting.
2591222	2592923	But they said it was gonna be live action.
2592923	2593263	No, I know.
2594130	2595191	So that's that's great.
2595191	2596852	Oh, you mean Ganon being animated?
2596852	2597752	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2597752	2600915	I mean, that people were assuming the movie would be animated.
2600915	2603596	But now we have the confirmation that it's going to be live action.
2603596	2606118	And I think that's very exciting for some people.
2606118	2608319	So, yeah, yeah, we'll see.
2608319	2613543	We'll see how it goes in our discord over at VOG Network dot com slash discord throughout the week.
2613543	2617285	People were tongue in cheek making jokes about the Smash Brothers initiative.
2617285	2623049	You know, now that we have what Detective Pikachu, Mario Brothers, Sonic and all these other movies.
2626114	2630744	Yeah, that won't be happening in a Legend of Zelda movie because my assumption is...
2631892	2639658	The Zelda movie will have more of a serious tone than what we saw in the Mario movie or Detective Pikachu or any of those other movies.
2639658	2643181	My assumption is that the Zelda movie is going to have a more serious tone.
2643181	2645342	I would assume so.
2645342	2647524	You'll be lucky if they sneak in the line.
2647524	2648945	Well, excuse me, princess.
2648945	2651407	You'll be damn lucky if that happens.
2651407	2653408	And that's about all you're going to get.
2653408	2654169	I hope it does.
2654169	2655029	I hope it does, too.
2655029	2656471	He said the thing.
2656471	2657711	Yeah.
2657711	2658652	But no, there's no...
2659953	2662475	I, yeah, MikeDef says, please don't.
2662475	2663735	I know you're all jesting, but still.
2663735	2669639	Yeah, I'm just really here to say that's not going to happen in the Zelda movie.
2669639	2672841	If anything like that were to ever happen, it's not going to.
2672841	2685188	But if it were to ever happen, it would happen in a more silly movie like the Sonic movie or the Mario movie or something that's or the upcoming Donkey Kong movie, I'm sure will happen eventually.
2685188	2685969	But it's not going to happen.
2687295	2688316	Let's go on to our next story Loki
2707287	2734194	Alright, so this is kind of, I mean it's not shocking because I think Xbox was the first to make this type of move but Sony is getting rid of Twitter integration as of tomorrow actually and you'll no longer be able to use the share button to actually share stuff to Twitter because you know a certain super smart genius CEO decided to really raise the cost of those APIs and so
2735410	2739431	Since they can't do the API calls, the functionality is buh-bye.
2739431	2747034	And I did love the comment, though, when they reached out to Elon Musk for a comment.
2747034	2759138	It's like, you know, our X is aiming to become a major streaming platform, and this will be less convenient for console players now that both Xbox and PlayStation integration is gone.
2759138	2760518	I will look into this.
2760518	2761539	Sure you will, bud.
2761539	2762179	Sure you will.
2762964	2768067	Well, at least it wasn't an auto-reply with a poop emoji, because I thought that's what inquiries were supposed to be getting.
2768067	2770569	But, you know, super mature.
2770569	2774891	It's just short-sighted and stupid, just like he is.
2774891	2775071	Yeah.
2775071	2776712	So, you know, what are you going to do?
2776712	2780315	Mike Deftonchat says, I'm amazed that Nintendo still has Twitter integration.
2780315	2783076	Yes, I am also amazed at that.
2783076	2787239	Is it something that, like, it's a time thing or something like that?
2787239	2789080	Like, do they have it for a certain amount of time?
2789080	2792462	And then when it comes up, it has to be renewed or I don't know.
2792762	2798125	No, I think it's after a certain point they were going to charge for their API stuff.
2798125	2802186	I think it was... I don't know what the details were there, but...
2804496	2810000	It's more of just like cost per use that they were having.
2810000	2815164	You know, the number of calls that they make in a certain time frame would cost a certain thing.
2815164	2823610	Maybe they have it bucketed based off of like, oh, this company sends like 10,000, this one sends 100,000, you know, and stuff like that.
2823610	2825691	Maybe they're just not using it that much.
2825691	2830935	I just think Nintendo is just slow to update stuff for their online service, and so they're probably just not
2832308	2842180	MikeDeft also points out, but granted you could just make the clip on the consoles, send it to your phone and upload wherever.
2842180	2843842	Yes, you can also put it on a USB device.
2853010	2855491	or get off Twitter.
2855491	2856571	That's your other option.
2856571	2857872	Get off Twitter.
2857872	2863814	But it's supposed to be a major streaming platform with everything and payments and stuff, right?
2863814	2870137	No, I'll tell you what the major streaming platform is now is TikTok and Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.
2870137	2875319	That's where I would expect PlayStation opens up their sharing to next.
2878200	2885668	I would be very surprised if at some point you are not able to share short clips to TikTok, Instagram, and or YouTube.
2885668	2889212	That would be the place that these things will go.
2889212	2899442	And I'm actually kind of surprised, maybe it's because threads kind of reeks of something very rushed by the Instagram folks, but I'm very surprised something like threads
2899943	2900444	Thanks for watching!
2911830	2915151	DarkTetsuya says, I'm just hoping BlueSky figures that stuff out.
2915151	2916592	I'm trying to be over there more.
2916592	2923775	I'm going to be a realist and somebody who loves, you know, BlueSky and the experience over there so far, don't hold your breath on that.
2923775	2926616	You got to remember, BlueSky still doesn't have GIFs.
2926616	2928837	It doesn't have direct messages.
2928837	2933419	There's a lot of features that didn't exist on Twitter at first, to be fair.
2933419	2936180	There were no GIFs integrated on Twitter at first, remember?
2936880	2939541	This all took time to get.
2939541	2942003	So eventually BlueSky will have some of that stuff.
2942003	2955870	It's just that BlueSky was actually trying to go a little bit of a Mastodon kind of route where it was decentralized, except the key difference and why it's working in a way that Mastodon isn't, is that there is a designated central server.
2956810	2961035	And then the app protocol is supposed to be for other things to kind of tie into Blue Sky.
2961035	2964698	But that's why Blue Sky is succeeding, where Mastodon... Well, I shouldn't say Mastodon's failing.
2964698	2965439	It's not.
2965439	2971445	Mastodon has its fans, but Mastodon isn't catching on in the same way for a lot of that.
2971445	2973307	It's kind of a techie place right now.
2973307	2975289	And then there's all these other things, too.
2975289	2978713	People talk about how certain people run their servers like they're an HOA.
2979133	2986034	That's the other problem that Mastodon has right now is that it's too strict in some places and people are just like, no, I don't want that.
2986034	2992535	Whereas honestly, Blue Sky is like, dicks, tits, ass, it's everywhere.
2992535	2993075	You want it?
2993075	2993976	You got it.
2993976	3000757	But there's good integrated sensitivity settings.
3000757	3003217	You just have to remember to fix those.
3003217	3007198	Well, the adult content filters are on by default.
3007958	3023225	But if you want to see dicks, tits, ass, you name it, if you want to see FCF, and you can look it up to see what that means, you have to enable your adult settings in Blue Sky on the web in order to do that.
3023225	3032730	So anyway, my point is don't expect Twitter or excuse me, don't expect PlayStation integration on Blue Sky anytime soon if Blue Sky doesn't even have GIFs yet.
3032730	3034471	It might get there eventually.
3034471	3037132	But right now, if I'm PlayStation,
3038286	3043307	I'm focused on TikTok, Instagram Stories, YouTube Shorts.
3043307	3046648	That's where the shares should be at.
3046648	3055150	And of course, if you want, you can still do that same thing where you download the screenshot and share it the long way.
3055150	3056430	You can do that on Blue Sky.
3056430	3060751	I've done that with screenshots from No Man's Sky and stuff.
3060751	3062451	No Man's Sky on Blue Sky.
3062451	3064412	That's not confusing by any means.
3064412	3065552	Yeah.
3065552	3065792	Anyway.
3067011	3067933	Alright, moving on.
3067933	3078172	Let's talk about some games that you definitely won't be sharing on Twitter because the future will be long gone by this point, and that is PlayStation Live service games that have been delayed.
3080367	3084130	Apparently half of the live service games have been delayed.
3084130	3089453	The interesting thing about this story is that we don't know what they are, because these are things that haven't been announced yet.
3089453	3102122	Sony President Hiroki Totoki told investors that six of the company's 12 upcoming live service games won't arrive until 2026 and after.
3102122	3106766	In a statement, we are reviewing the, excuse me, it's actually a transcription from the call,
3108243	3109587	We are reviewing this.
3109587	3114760	We are trying as much as possible to ensure the games are enjoyed and liked by gamers for a long time.
3116135	3121179	of the 12 titles, six titles will be released by fiscal year 2025.
3121179	3122821	That's our current plan.
3122821	3126444	As for the remaining six titles, we're still working on that.
3126444	3137292	So SOTY going on to talk about that, you know, the big live service push, it doesn't change anything for the company, it gain quality is going to be the most important thing that it added added up.
3137292	3139074	So but so far,
3140936	3145184	Horizon Forbidden West, Spider-Man 2, doing very well for Sony.
3145184	3149312	Spider-Man 2 sold 5 million copies in its first week.
3149312	3152036	Something to stack up there.
3153766	3178711	but we'll see we'll see what stuff is in store as far as their other live service games again these are things that are designed to keep the money rolling in regularly for better or for worse you know sometimes people are into it sometimes they're not so it really again the quality of the game is the big deal right and sometimes the not is the actual company that's doing the live service too yeah and that could be that too absolutely but like you know
3179761	3180582	Battle Pass Cosmetics
3198038	3204000	Necessitates it and has the quality that the fan base will support that stuff, then there you go.
3204000	3206541	But I think we've said this a lot.
3206541	3209823	Don't shoehorn this shit into games that don't need it.
3209823	3212424	And that's what pisses people off about Diablo 4, honestly.
3212424	3213304	And I do get it.
3213304	3214244	I do get it.
3214244	3217866	You know, Diablo is not always a series that had this type of stuff.
3219577	3228664	Anyway, all right, moving on, DarkSakura with a very interesting, bleak, in some ways, look at the future of games.
3228664	3231266	So we'll talk about it.
3231266	3239332	Oh, yeah, when I saw this announcement, I was pissed because it was during the middle of, well, toward the end days of the SAG AfterStrike.
3244267	3261206	posted on social media that I refuse to name that they are pushing more AI development with M12 Ventures in-world AI.
3261206	3262747	Hold on, let me rephrase myself.
3262747	3264589	Microsoft and M2 Ventures
3266310	3280457	Portfolio company InWorld AI announced that they are developing generative AI tools for video games, a two-part toolkit that acts as a, quote, design co-pilot.
3280457	3286540	So it's supposed to let developers focus more on narrative, quest, game elements.
3286540	3288221	Oh.
3288221	3289501	People pissed.
3289501	3293043	Like, don't they even pay attention to the fucking news?
3293043	3293383	Do they?
3294423	3296405	Oh, this pissed off everybody.
3296405	3304514	Developers, voice actors, writers, influencers, of course.
3304514	3310501	Especially in light of an industry that's had its layoffs in the thousands.
3310501	3311322	I mean, hello?
3314119	3316060	This isn't empowerment.
3316060	3325685	This is... Well, it's empowering them to turn a profit and pay fewer people is what it's empowering.
3325685	3328426	It's absolutely terrible.
3328426	3341553	It's... I mean, and again, there may be a bit of jumping to conclusions on here because, of course, the first thing that you're gonna think of is how we've already seen AI be misused.
3341553	3342013	But, like...
3343593	3354484	The big thing about this is that it's not going to be co-pilot, it's going to be a replacement.
3354484	3362152	They've already started using some of these tools to cut the workforce in part.
3362152	3365676	And I understand, to a degree, having an AI assist
3367128	3374372	would be helpful, I think, used in tandem with actually paying people to fucking be creative.
3374372	3375133	You know what I mean?
3375133	3375613	Yeah.
3375613	3385279	A computer isn't going to have the level of creativity that a writer is going to have or an artist or a designer.
3385279	3394384	They're not going to have the kind of emotiveness that a voice actor or a motion capture actor is going to have.
3394384	3395524	It's just not going to do it.
3396925	3400428	It's not near that level yet.
3400428	3416983	If it was something like, hey, I just designed all of these assets and I would like to get an idea of, you know, verify the database and let me know if these assets are going to be compatible with each other, you know, or, you know,
3418144	3422468	What assets do we have in the database that are going to apply to this?
3422468	3426993	And then let an artist go to work and make the best use of it.
3426993	3428654	You know, something like an assistive tool.
3428654	3429255	Yeah, that's it.
3429255	3434299	And they are phrasing it as an assistive tool, but I'm pretty sure that that's not what it's actually going to be.
3436782	3440985	There's way too much focus on it.
3440985	3444387	The industry has just dumped so much money into it.
3444387	3447290	And I'm a fan of machine learning.
3447290	3457077	You know, I think it's kind of interesting to see in general, you know, like how it works, you know, the theory behind it.
3457077	3462762	But in my mind, machine learning to me is advanced database access, right?
3466368	3474899	an entity that uses that database to do the job of a human, that's when you're getting into the dangerous territory.
3474899	3476841	I have no problem with machine learning.
3476841	3480686	I have a problem with how it's being implemented.
3480686	3481367	I hope that made sense.
3482000	3482300	DarkSakura
3507754	3512437	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3535717	3540900	Well, a lot of the ways that we're talking about AI is machine learning.
3540900	3550324	That's why I was quick to say earlier, I differentiated between machine learning and AI because AI is how it accesses the database that's learned.
3550324	3553646	It's like the difference between reading your book and being the brain.
3555723	3580448	Um, but when it comes to machine learning and, you know, um, the, a system type of thing, um, I do think it's going to happen in video games because I think as we see textures get more and more, you know, that's, that's what takes video games so long to develop in part right now is trying to create these 4k art assets and trying to animate things, you know, and so forth.
3580968	3594820	I think as we start getting into 8K televisions and even more frames a second and so forth, I think to bridge that gap in how long these art assets take to create, it's going to take some of that machine learning to make that happen.
3594820	3603567	But in that copilot sense, you know, still with the creative mind ultimately being in control, but using machine learning to, you know,
3604588	3606390	assist with those sorts of things.
3606390	3622084	That's where I sort of see this kind of coming in too, especially because too, that way with something like that, you're also able to feed it off your own company's information and you're not like feeding off of everything out there and stealing from all this stuff and that whole thing.
3622084	3625026	So that's all.
3625026	3625787	I just, yeah.
3627260	3640045	I do think it's going to happen in that end of things, and I don't think there's any getting around it, and I think, ethically, it's probably okay, because I sort of look at it as, like, it's just a really souped up, like, Photoshop filter.
3640045	3641806	Really, really, really souped up.
3642406	3643586	But like, that's what it is.
3643586	3648708	It's an automated process applying to your thing to get it to do what you need it to do.
3648708	3652810	Like I'm, you know, I'm extremely simplifying it, but that's like what I kind of look at it as.
3652810	3659552	But when it comes to the creative parts with like text and voice, oh god, especially like voice acting and that sort of thing and all that stuff.
3659552	3661613	Like, no, just don't.
3661613	3668055	Like you're gonna get what you pay for and the fans are going to see through it.
3668055	3670756	You don't need a glorified macro.
3677057	3680019	that's what you have people for.
3680019	3684381	It's ridiculous.
3684381	3688724	All right, well, let's move on to another pretty sad story.
3688724	3692046	But unfortunately, I think we kind of saw this one coming.
3692046	3694087	But yeah, just another bummer in 2023 gaming news.
3696092	3701599	Yeah, so finally Activision Blizzard has confirmed the end of the Overwatch League.
3701599	3709228	Now before we were kind of just, we saw the writing on the wall with that, but now they've officially ended.
3709228	3714174	They said we are transitioning from the Overwatch League and evolving competitive
3714654	3717577	Overwatch in a new direction.
3717577	3726885	We are grateful to everyone who made Overwatch League possible and remain focused on building our vision of a revitalized esports program.
3726885	3729548	And of course, they're going to have details in the future.
3729548	3735273	Right now, they've paid out the 120, or the 20 teams involved, a total of $120 million.
3738335	3741016	But then now that is, it is done.
3741016	3749981	So I guess we will see what new league or new way they do eSports is gonna be.
3749981	3757084	Like I said, they didn't really detail that yet, but... Yeah, interesting.
3759707	3765350	Well, yeah, and I can't help but think of like the Heroes of the Storm professional stuff and how that just kind of disappeared.
3765350	3768011	And then that didn't that didn't bode well for the future of that game.
3768011	3770572	I mean, it's still up, but it's in a very autopilot mode.
3770572	3773774	I don't see that happening with Overwatch, especially coming off of Blizzcon.
3773774	3779157	But it does feel like losing that is but I just I feel like Overwatch League
3780188	3788274	I think from the very beginning, well, the pandemic, you know, and all that, the COVID showing up and canceling live events for so long really didn't help.
3788274	3797761	Like, if you want to point at anything and go, that really kind of, like, stunted any growth that thing potentially had, I would say, you know what, it is COVID-19's fault.
3799927	3808596	I still think they made some missteps in like how they pivoted from Twitch to YouTube and then pivoted like they kind of kept moving it around.
3808596	3818485	And I really think they probably should have invested in a central place to do this because it's not like switching from Twitch to YouTube is not as simple as switching from ABC to CBS.
3819586	3846263	and I feel like executives don't understand what a shock they don't understand that that the way the viewer habits are they don't it's switching from twitch to youtube is not the same as switching from abc to fox or whatever and i i think that was a bad decision in the beginning as well um yeah phil and i in a chat says not to discredit all the hard work involved but i always feel like blizz esports are just for show stop trying to make them happen blizz
3847105	3855572	I, in some ways it did really feel like they were really put, cause they wanted overwatch to be, you know, e-sports has kind of been bubbling.
3855572	3857473	They all want it to be the next pro football, right?
3857473	3859635	They want it to be something televised.
3859635	3864819	And so, so overwatch was really just trying to position itself as like, okay, if any game goes big, it's going to be this.
3864819	3875448	And it did get like ABC coverage, you know, in the middle of the day on a Sunday, but it's still, it's still, you know, was there and was starting to, you know, kind of go through a little bit, but I just, I don't know.
3877253	3892715	I feel like if your goal is to be accepted by the traditional broadcast methods, then you're not really looking at the new, modern, traditional forms of broadcast and how to get successful there.
3894335	3898417	I don't know, it's complicated, but I just think all the moving around was not good.
3898417	3900178	So no, it was not helping.
3900178	3901038	Yeah.
3901038	3909163	No, but it's unfortunate because again, there's a lot of people involved in Overwatch League, a lot of people that work in that, a lot of hosts, a lot of players.
3909163	3911664	So it's just it's it's a bummer all around.
3911664	3915746	So maybe something more homegrown can grow from it.
3915746	3921889	But unfortunately, it's probably going to be a lot harder to get more mainstream coverage with that.
3921889	3923390	So, yeah.
3923618	3924518	All right.
3924518	3929400	Well, moving on, let's talk a little bit about Netflix's foray into more mobile games.
3929400	3933781	You know, we've been talking about this for a little while, that Netflix has been wanting to expand into doing more mobile games.
3933781	3936122	It doesn't seem like they're doing anything with it.
3936122	3938983	Like, it's just like, ooh, they've got mobile games.
3938983	3944405	Yeah, well, and they're usually things that aren't, you know, it's like, whatever, they're not interesting.
3944405	3948266	Like that Stranger Things original game was really not good, you know, and so forth.
3948266	3952067	But here's the thing is that Netflix is doing some interesting positioning
3952407	3960175	to try to make their libraries stronger because they just announced Hades will soon be available to Netflix subscribers on iOS.
3960175	3964078	Not Android right now, but it will be on iOS.
3964078	3967642	The thing about that is there isn't Hades on iOS yet.
3967642	3973928	So this is new and kind of exclusive to Netflix and Hades was a pretty solid game.
3973928	3975349	So that's going to be very interesting.
3976690	3980634	Braid, The Anniversary Edition, Upgraded Audio, Hand Repainted Visuals, New Animation, and apparently New World of Puzzles to Solve
3997432	3999934	also Commentary, which is kind of interesting.
3999934	4002216	So that is coming to Netflix as well.
4002216	4007800	That also will be coming to Windows and PlayStation and Xbox though, but you know, for mobiles, that's still pretty cool.
4007800	4010662	Death's Door as well going to be coming as well.
4010662	4011682	Katana Zero.
4011682	4020709	So you see the Netflix is trying to amp it up a little bit in that department so that what Loki just said is not what people continue to say about Netflix.
4020709	4025892	And I think the whole, you know, trying to get some exclusives in that department is a pretty big deal.
4027924	4031747	SGO100 Matt says the mobile games are just getting their foot in the door.
4031747	4037992	They're establishing itself as a platform before they start coming out with bigger titles.
4037992	4038993	All right.
4038993	4045738	Well, let's travel back to a simpler time in this next segment than before we had games on our mobile devices.
4045738	4048901	You played your game on your CRT TV and you liked it.
4059597	4067363	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time, where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4067363	4070986	It's time for the Classic Game of the Week.
4070986	4074768	Alright, and DarkSakura, what did you pick as the classic game this week?
4076849	4083438	I picked Treasure of the Rudras, which is also known as Rudra no Hiho.
4083438	4091548	It is the game that I have started playing for Retro Night on Saturday and it's been on my list for a while and I decided just to
4092449	4095171	Go on in, you know.
4095171	4106740	But it is a JRPG that was released by Square in 1996, and it is the last RPG that they developed for the Super Famicom.
4106740	4108281	So it's a big one.
4108281	4113565	And it it brings in some elements from
4116272	4122098	I would probably say some different Indian faiths.
4122098	4131909	They talk of Rudra, which is a name taken from an aspect of Shiva.
4131909	4135232	And it talks about the wheel of creation and the wheel of time.
4139801	4151464	I will say right now, it's like with any Japanese RPG, there are so many elements taken from so many different cultures that I'm not going to go further and address that.
4151464	4154565	So basically, in the cycle of this game,
4156086	4160648	You show up when it's the age of humans.
4160648	4171795	So every 4,000 years, different races of beings, different species are wiped out.
4171795	4175718	You start off with like a
4176684	4184531	The previous ones, there had been the Danons, there had been the Merfolk, the Reptiles, the Giants, finally you're on the Humans.
4184531	4189775	And you start 15 days before the new cycle is about to begin.
4189775	4193098	And so you have three different scenarios.
4193098	4200244	One where you're playing Xion, the soldier, Risa, the princess, or an archaeologist named Serlam.
4201285	4214012	And each of them in their 15 days have this, it's called a jade, that gets like embedded in them.
4214012	4220635	And they are going across different tasks that they have to accomplish in those last 15 days.
4223077	4230587	And so you can actually switch out between the different storylines while you're doing it.
4230587	4235973	I'm kind of going through one versus the other, you know?
4238977	4249823	But at any rate, sometimes they meet each other, they have an effect on each other, and then it can affect the story and over.
4249823	4256987	So for example, if one character leaves a relic somewhere, another character can pick it up on their part of the journey.
4258908	4260629	So, you know, different things like that.
4260629	4273797	And then when you've done the three scenarios, you take on a fourth scenario involving, named the thief, Dune, who you run into in the rest of the, you know, earlier on in the story.
4273797	4277179	So it's very pretty.
4277179	4281041	The music is great.
4281041	4283442	I like the characters.
4283442	4287465	The character designer was done by Amemiya Keita.
4291148	4294650	and I'm trying to think what else.
4294650	4299873	He did some work for some of the Kamen Rider series.
4299873	4306397	He worked on Zerom, Mirai Ninja, Hakaider.
4306397	4309359	He worked on a lot of different stuff for TV.
4309359	4309879	Garou,
4312621	4318205	He also worked on Zyuranger, a couple episodes there.
4318205	4328492	This was a pretty big title, being one of the last ones that went on there.
4328492	4334256	No spoilers, please.
4334256	4342181	It was also the last game directed by Ide Kozy, who went on to retire after directing three titles.
4343842	4357654	This game still uses pixel art, even though 3D had already started being incorporated into some of Square's other games, like for example Chrono Trigger.
4357654	4365060	But one of the more unique things about this is that it has a word-based magic system.
4367433	4373398	In the fan translation that I'm playing through, they're referred to as mantras.
4373398	4377621	They are just called magic words in the Japanese version.
4381768	4392232	Basically, you learn basic ones, but you can mix and match parts of those mantras to create a different spell.
4392232	4400754	So, for example, you could change, like, say the first part of it makes it a fire spell, but it's only a single target.
4400754	4402155	You can rename
4403055	4407979	the second part of it to make it one that attacks everybody.
4407979	4418387	So, you know, you can make take something from being as destructive to a healing one that, you know, it's very, very in depth and kind of difficult to master.
4418387	4423271	I'm just gonna say right there.
4423271	4423731	Excuse me.
4427019	4435542	So, at any rate, the music in this game, the soundtrack was scored by SocietyUG.
4435542	4437563	It's a really, really pretty soundtrack.
4437563	4440204	I really, really like it.
4440204	4450127	And then the actual CD that came out had a track of the game's music called The Spirit Chaser by a group called The Stealth Boys.
4450127	4451348	And there's music in my sheet music.
4453008	4462813	So at any rate, this game was mostly positively received.
4462813	4467675	Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40, for example.
4467675	4472197	There were some people who loved the actual notability.
4473764	4489129	the uniqueness of the magic system but also considered it to be a little bit too difficult for some people that the going in and out of the different storylines is a very novel approach to it that you can just switch around
4491111	4498202	There's some that have even said it's one of the best games ever to come out on Super Famicom.
4498202	4501988	The graphics in this are really, really good.
4501988	4504091	And the story is very...
4507133	4509013	Very ambitious is a good word for it.
4509013	4512974	I didn't want to take a word someone else had used, but it was considered very ambitious.
4512974	4515415	And I think that it is.
4515415	4524117	There's a comment from Destructoid where they compared the plot and the perspectives to kind of like Game of Thrones.
4524117	4531479	But of course, you know, the big complaint being the difficulty of the linguistic magic system.
4531479	4535200	But at any rate, I'm thoroughly enjoying this game.
4537635	4548645	I have just gotten... I'm probably two hours, of course, two, three hours into the game right now, but I'm really enjoying it so far.
4548645	4552949	I'm invested in the characters, and I'm really having a good time.
4552949	4555592	So, that's the game.
4555592	4558935	Rudra no Hiho, Treasure of the Rudra.
4560336	4583588	all right and you know i've never i've never really knew anything about this game so this is definitely like a hidden gem of sorts so i mean obviously if it didn't come out here uh i probably you know would be less familiar with it but um yeah i think it's that's pretty cool one of those views i didn't play before so for me it's all completely new i'm really real rob i think you should play through it i think you know i mean so far
4583908	4585890	The backlog of games I have is unreal right now.
4585890	4588411	But yeah, no, I yeah, I'd love to.
4588411	4591093	God, I need to quit my job and play games all day.
4591093	4592354	I'm going to become a streamer for a living.
4592354	4594876	How's that sound?
4594876	4595837	I'm going to be broke too.
4595837	4596878	Yeah.
4596878	4598379	Default on my mortgage.
4598379	4601601	Quest Buster in chat says doubling down with what DarkSakura is saying.
4601601	4605304	Typing in your own spells was a really exciting mechanic in this game for me.
4605304	4608487	Just really felt like a very creative thing to play with.
4608487	4611009	So there you go.
4611009	4612290	All right.
4612290	4612650	Love that.
4614055	4614855	Uh, okay.
4614855	4618276	Um, with that, we have some more stories coming at you.
4618276	4623077	Uh, we're going to do some really quick in a segment we call Rapid Fire News.
4623077	4625578	Uh, let's go to Loki.
4625578	4626258	Uh, yes.
4626258	4632259	So we have news, of course, that Super Mario Wonder sold well because it's a Mario game and it's on the Switch.
4632259	4638541	And so of course it did really well, uh, 4.3 million units globally in the first two weeks.
4639249	4641011	So that's pretty awesome.
4641011	4645756	It has become the biggest release for a Super Mario title so far.
4645756	4648499	I say so far because you know the next one will be bigger.
4648499	4649580	Super Mario RPG.
4649580	4650281	Who knows?
4650281	4651402	Who knows?
4651402	4651983	Yeah, maybe.
4651983	4652423	We'll see.
4652423	4653865	That's the big release coming out.
4653865	4657229	Not to spoil release dates, but I think most people are already tracking that.
4658393	4669000	Yep, and then we got news also, surprisingly, that Homelander, who is going to be in Mortal Kombat 1, is not going to be voiced by Anthony Starr.
4669000	4675245	I'm wondering if that has something to do with the whole actor strike thing that was going on.
4675245	4684951	But apparently, they asked if Homelander was going to be voiced by Anthony Starr on, I believe, Twitter and, oh no, I'm sorry, Reddit.
4684951	4686853	And they said, nope, he is not.
4688789	4689649	So that's strange.
4689649	4695251	They've already ripped the character out of Mortal Kombat 1.
4695251	4699291	Like you mean like the assets or whatever?
4699291	4701612	The assets have already been pulled from it.
4701612	4703432	Yeah.
4703432	4703793	All right.
4703793	4707773	But yeah, so that's unfortunate.
4707773	4711654	It would have been really cool, but it's still cool, though, that he's in the game.
4711654	4713155	Yeah.
4713155	4714155	All right, DarkSakura.
4718309	4725275	Um, a lot of folks are excited and a lot of people are crying as well for other reasons about it.
4725275	4729698	But, um, the Stranger Things chapter is back in Dead by Daylight.
4731032	4742799	We had gone over, you know, back when it was removed that it had to do, the theory was a lot with Netflix going into gaming and having their own Stranger Things game.
4742799	4744479	Well, we know what happened with that.
4744479	4748642	We don't want to say we told you so, but we're absolutely going to say we told you so.
4748642	4755866	So Steve and Nancy are back and so is the Demodoggo, I'm sorry, the Demogorgon.
4755866	4757887	And of course the Hawkins map.
4758827	4763311	And funny enough, I had never played Hawkins as a survivor.
4763311	4764772	Oh, I had only played as a killer.
4764772	4766293	Because you were a killer only then.
4766293	4770396	You hadn't discovered your love of survivor yet.
4770396	4771257	Interesting.
4771257	4773979	And the funny thing, though, is that.
4773979	4776882	Me having played as killer.
4776882	4785849	Made me super prepared for survivor on that match on that area, because I used to remember the places that I would forget to look at.
4787099	4791642	Remember them playing Survivor and, you know, some of the different turnarounds.
4791642	4795425	And the polyester room is still there.
4795425	4796546	You know what I'm talking about?
4796546	4801350	Yeah, the shot, because there's a clip of the streamer that was looking for their room.
4801350	4801490	Yeah.
4803823	4808145	Yeah, I think there's only certain situations a nurse can go in.
4808145	4811027	I think it's only a nurse that can teleport into that wall.
4811027	4812447	Or you can clip through it.
4812447	4818691	But anyway, now there are some things going on with this that kind of have me upset.
4818691	4823333	And it's just because the achievements are not going to be enabled.
4824195	4827378	Sam and Dean will never be in a Dead by Daylight game.
4827378	4830501	I do not want them in a Dead by Daylight game.
4830501	4833344	They would have to be survivors and that's not going to happen.
4851219	4852520	Let's not traumatize me that way.
4852520	4855821	I don't even know what you're talking about.
4855821	4857262	Supernatural.
4857262	4858763	Okay, I wouldn't know that.
4858763	4859923	I've never seen the show.
4859923	4861124	Okay, got it.
4861124	4861364	Okay.
4866756	4873942	So at any rate, you're not necessarily playing as the doll.
4873942	4877865	You are playing as Charles Lee Ray, possessing the doll.
4877865	4881989	So your first person perspective is as the ghost.
4883166	4886567	And you are watching the back of Chucky running around doing stuff.
4886567	4888568	I love how they solved this.
4888568	4890548	Because everyone was like, oh, he's too small.
4890548	4891448	It's not going to work.
4891448	4894109	The perspective is going to be wrong.
4894109	4894929	They made it work.
4894929	4896330	You play the ghost.
4896330	4898270	Their render of him looked like a picture of my dad.
4898270	4899010	I'm sorry.
4899010	4900171	Just like a picture of my dad in the 70s.
4902533	4916598	What's cool is that when you are picking up a survivor, hook them, the ghost manifests and carries them, Chucky in one arm and the survivor in the other.
4916598	4926842	And when the full one comes out, one of the premium skins is going to be Tiffany, voiced by Miss Tilly herself.
4928729	4932090	So I am so excited about this.
4932090	4937192	This you have you all have to understand Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany is gay rights.
4937192	4940493	I realize not everybody in chat or on the podcast is going to understand this.
4940493	4946555	I realize you have to understand Tiffany, Jennifer Tilly, gay rights.
4946555	4948936	There you go.
4948936	4949556	Yep.
4949556	4953538	But I mean, for anyone who is watching live, you can see.
4953538	4954478	Yeah, found some random people.
4954478	4955778	Everyone's like, oh, it's third person.
4955778	4957079	It's not third person.
4958120	4961443	Your first person as the ghost.
4961443	4963245	So I think that that's really cool.
4963245	4971112	Also, one of my favorite YouTube personalities, MintSkull, went through and did all of the Easter eggs.
4971112	4976777	His Mori is a combination of like six to seven different Easter eggs from the movies.
4976777	4977838	Yeah.
4977838	4978338	It's pretty cool.
4979298	4980679	Yeah, that's neat.
4980679	4983540	I think a lot of people were wondering like how they were going to make this happen.
4983540	4985920	Like a lot of people were saying, well, you can't get Chucky in Dead by Daylight.
4985920	4986581	It wouldn't work.
4986581	4988481	And they they found a way to make it work.
4988481	4991703	And I think a lot of people are really thrilled about it.
4991703	4997925	A lot of people thought they were going to pull like a Sadako and have it be like telekinetic or something, which no.
4997925	5002626	Or I imagine the hook coming down so that little doll could pull it.
5002626	5002807	Yeah.
5004742	5009143	So yeah, but no, I think that's the way that I really like how they did it.
5009143	5015826	And it's also a nod to the actual origin, even though I still swear looks like my dad doesn't.
5015826	5020887	It looks kind of like the actor, but it looks like a picture I have of my dad with his eyes rolled up like that.
5020887	5025108	Oh, I really hope the Tiffany one is Jennifer Tilly likeness.
5025108	5026809	I know they said it's announced.
5026809	5027289	Oh yeah.
5027289	5029170	They showed what it looks like.
5029170	5031250	Oh, I hadn't seen that yet.
5031250	5032371	Oh, goody, goody, goody.
5032371	5032651	Oh yeah.
5032651	5032951	Hold on.
5034031	5037373	Oh, I'm so excited.
5037373	5041235	Anyway, it's fine if you send it out, I'm not going to be able to bring it up, so it's fine.
5041235	5042715	I'll just I'll take your word for it.
5042715	5043676	So I'm excited.
5043676	5044836	Yeah, I knew her voice was in it.
5044836	5046797	I didn't realize they had announced the likeness too.
5046797	5047278	I missed that.
5047278	5049079	OK, but that's that's great.
5049079	5050119	Oh, heck yeah.
5050119	5050519	That's her.
5050519	5052640	That's honestly in my dead by daylight.
5052640	5054641	I play maybe one game every other day.
5054641	5059244	Like if that this this that is going to single handedly make me play the game more.
5059244	5059864	It will.
5059864	5061625	Like, I'm really excited about that.
5061625	5061705	So.
5062557	5066718	Alright, moving on with some other news in the gaming world.
5066718	5071760	Let's talk about the Gold Master series from Digital Eclipse.
5071760	5082062	A game that I thought was very good that a lot of people are sleeping on is the Gold Master series, The Making of Karateka, which was released.
5082062	5083163	Gosh, when did that come out?
5083163	5084943	It was a couple weeks ago?
5084943	5087564	No, it was more like a couple months ago at this point, maybe like six weeks ago.
5088304	5091705	But yeah, that was the first in the Gold Master Series.
5091705	5095727	Well, we know that another game is coming in the Gold Master Series.
5095727	5105230	As far as what the game is going to be, we'll find out on December 6th is when that is going to be announced, what the next game is.
5105230	5113013	Unfortunately, my story that said what that is supposed to tie to is not coming up right now, so I know it's some type of event that's happening.
5114733	5115294	Game Awards
5129318	5129818	We'll see.
5129818	5142802	Yeah, I and again, I thought the reason why I liked if you want to check out our YouTube channel over at VOG Network, Bobby Blackwolf and I did a deep dive on the making of Karateka together and why we liked it a lot.
5142802	5151485	And, you know, some of the things we'd like to see in a sequel and even theorize some games that could be coming because there were some very interesting cameos that I think lend itself to a hint.
5151485	5152485	But we'll see.
5152485	5156447	So, yeah, that will be announced on December 6th.
5157327	5160731	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some game releases.
5160731	5166418	I think this is the last big game release week before we hit Thanksgiving, right?
5166418	5168461	So this is gonna be a big one.
5168461	5174769	Um, maybe next week there might be some stuff, but once you hit like that Black Friday Thanksgiving week, then it's just...
5175763	5177586	Dead.
5177586	5180151	Oh, you're right, we're looking ahead.

5415367	5420189	Also coming out on the Switch, Momotaro Densetsu World is out.
5420189	5426090	Also, Naruto X Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections is out in Japan this week.

5472904	5477306	Heading over to the PlayStation 5 to see what is coming out there.
5477306	5480448	I don't bother to read Xbox in Japan because there really isn't anything.
5480448	5495796	But sometimes Sony has a few things and this week that Yohane the Parhelion Blaze in the Deep Blue is also out on PlayStation 5 and Guilty Gear Strive in a 25th anniversary box is out this week from Arc System Works and
5496696	5502379	I think that's actually, oh no, Persona 5 Tactica also out on the PlayStation 5 this week.
5502379	5504940	That is it for your Japanese releases.
5504940	5510182	So let's go over to Europe and I need to take a quick, quick AFK while Jamie's reading these dates.

5598538	5598998	That would be it.
5599753	5601374	That's a big one for the week.
5601374	5604195	A lot of people love Bluey.
5604195	5605135	I have really good timing.
5605135	5607376	All right.
5607376	5617741	Let's go on for a few more news stories, and then we'll open it up for questions and chat and other participation from our live audience, as well as any emails from the podcast folk.
5617741	5621503	If we have any this week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
5621503	5622183	But first, Loki.
5623749	5633011	So, Steam is going to be rolling out a new feature that allows you to mark games as private and hide them from your friends.
5633011	5638352	And so, of course, the first thing people think of is like, ah, see, you can hide all your porn games now.
5638352	5640733	Now no one knows that you can play the dirty games.
5640733	5649975	Or I guess no one can know that you play the games that you wrote a petition saying that you'd never play the game, you know, and then you did buy the game and played it.
5652864	5654825	So yeah, that'll be coming at some point.
5654825	5657326	I'm not exactly sure how that's gonna work.
5657326	5663130	It basically allows you to hide different achievements and stuff that you get.
5663130	5670274	Mark achievements, various gameplay, and screenshots as private, which is the current settings.
5673436	5679217	then they're just going to basically allow you to keep it private from everybody.
5679217	5679917	So that's cool.
5679917	5683718	So I can hide the number of hours I have on Dead by Daylight and not be so embarrassed.
5683718	5685298	Yes, you can.
5685298	5687598	Oh, good.
5687598	5689619	Happy to hear it.
5689619	5689959	All right.
5689959	5694540	I'm not embarrassed at all, because I got most of mine on Stadia.
5694540	5695040	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5695040	5700661	I'd be like, you've only played like, yeah, and I still kicked your ass.
5700661	5701421	All right.
5701421	5702261	Moving on, DarkSakura.
5705722	5707183	Okay.
5707183	5715029	So, um, one of the biggest complaints about, you know, dancing games is that it's not very accessible for everybody.
5715029	5719212	And people love music and they love moving however that they can.
5719212	5724755	Um, Ubisoft is actually doing something a bit right.
5724755	5727457	But they're doing this.
5727457	5734302	They are, um, trying to put things in, uh, for, uh,
5735840	5751211	People who have difficulties in movement, they have invited actually over a kid 14 to their Paris studio to test out a version of Just Dance.
5751211	5757455	He has a muscle wasting condition called Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
5761079	5767346	He is wheelchair-bound, but he has upper body movement.
5767346	5777638	Basically, he was speaking with some of their choreographers and designers to help create routines for people in the game who are
5778419	5779741	He is a member of the Welsh Youth Parliament.
5794528	5794808	a lot
5812779	5821691	It's gonna be a long road, I think, to make a game 100% accessible to people, because there's things you can't account for in the game.
5821691	5824134	So, that's how it is.
5824134	5826037	But what I like is that...
5828662	5844685	one of their representatives was going and saying that, and her name is Stacey Jenkins, by the way, was that if you are a developer and you're interested in accessibility, you need to listen to disabled people.
5844685	5848566	Basically, don't make the decision for them, make the decision with them.
5848566	5852347	And so their whole goal is that with every iteration,
5853427	5859373	that they are able to open the audience more and more to the game.
5859373	5867862	And apparently this team had a really good time playing the game.
5867862	5868202	I'm glad.
5870014	5871955	Yeah, that sounds that sounds neat.
5871955	5875236	I'm glad they found a way to do that and kind of work that out.
5875236	5876516	I'm curious.
5876516	5881678	We'll see maybe it open it up to us because you know, Just Dance can be very popular with streamers sometimes.
5881678	5887140	I'm kind of curious to see if we see you know, maybe some streamers that are able to do this game that maybe couldn't do it before.
5887140	5890022	So now that this is an option, so pretty cool.
5890022	5893783	All right.
5893783	5896144	All right, well, let's move on to Loki.
5898120	5903784	Yep, I am extremely excited about this.
5903784	5909769	Finally, finally, we're gonna get Grand Theft Auto 6's reveal.
5909769	5920357	It is supposed to happen, according to Rockstar Games, early December is when they're going to be releasing their first trailer for the next game.
5922611	5925813	What else is in early December?
5925813	5931636	Plank, I couldn't think of anything else that happens to be early December that has big trailers in it.
5931636	5934817	Nope, not one thing starring Geoff Keighley.
5934817	5940100	So I'm wondering if that will make an appearance there or if they'll just do their own thing.
5940100	5947124	Although, although what a fucking power move if they release it that morning just before the ceremony.
5947124	5949365	That would be kind of a power move.
5949365	5950606	Yeah, I don't know.
5950606	5950846	I mean,
5952628	5955490	It would be cool to see something like that.
5955490	5960712	But yeah, I'm excited since it looked, based off the leaked footage, it looked good.
5960712	5965555	So I can't wait to see the official reveal.
5965555	5966535	I'm going to be excited.
5966535	5967856	I'll buy it no matter what.
5967856	5969377	Of course you will.
5969377	5972058	I just won't play Grand Theft Auto online.
5972058	5973539	Probably.
5973539	5973799	Maybe.
5975003	5975964	All right.
5975964	5983671	Well, lastly here tonight, one thing you definitely won't be doing in the near future is participating in Twitch hype chats.
5983671	5984331	That's right.
5984331	5991838	Hype chat, you probably don't know it exists because we never talk about it here because I think it's, it's not, it just, it doesn't have a point.
5992338	5993479	What is Hype Chat?
6011229	6013350	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
6013350	6013850	Good.
6013850	6014511	Bye.
6014511	6020894	But now after five months of being out there, it will no longer be available from November 15th.
6020894	6027578	Twitch is saying, though, they're going to invest more into cheering and bits, and they make it sound like you will just be able to use bits.
6028871	6031193	to do what this used to do.
6031193	6044122	In a tweet, Twitch support wrote, based on the community's feedback, we've decided to depreciate hype chat on, excuse me, deprecate hype chat on November 15th and invest more into cheering and bits going forward.
6044122	6047665	We still believe in the value of pin messages and fast moving chats.
6047665	6051488	Viewers will be able to pin cheers with bits in the coming weeks.
6051488	6056652	So, I mean, it really sounds like they're kind of just shifting it somewhere else, but all right.
6057472	6064635	It's obvious that, you know, bits, subs, that's where the money is that people make on Twitch.
6064635	6066937	So that's that.
6066937	6069778	So again, November 15th is the end of that.
6069778	6076021	I'm going to say this right now.
6076021	6082184	If you want a say in some of the stuff that goes on on Twitch, make sure that you sign up for Twitch RPG.
6083430	6100865	their research program where they send out surveys or sometimes they'll even actually talk to people directly or they'll have you do input on certain features.
6100865	6103827	And like for a survey, you know, you might get 500 bits.
6103827	6105829	I got 500 bits for a survey.
6105829	6108051	You know, you are under an NDA with it.
6109165	6115400	But it's a way to look at some of these features and have your voice heard about it, whether or not, you know, if you like it or not.
6117907	6131056	I took a survey that I guess was under NDA this week, not related to that, but different because I always thought I just thought the concept of NDA was survey was a little silly because I was like, you're not like I'm just agreeing to take the survey.
6131056	6134078	I'm not citing my name and but what does it matter if this gets out?
6134078	6134598	So I don't know.
6134598	6135178	It's weird.
6135178	6135659	It was weird.
6135659	6141522	And the questions that I was being asked was not anything that kind of like wasn't already known.
6142523	6145084	So maybe they just don't want people to know they were surveying on it.
6145084	6145744	I don't know.
6145744	6147744	So I can't tell you what it is.
6147744	6162387	But if there were a game that I played a lot of and talked about a lot, it's very likely that company is going to target me for one of these surveys because I play a lot of this game.
6162387	6166208	So anyway, something to think about.
6166208	6166768	All right.
6166768	6169209	Yeah.
6169209	6170509	Let's move on.
6170509	6170949	Oh, go ahead.
6172895	6173564	Yeah, then.
6173564	6173645	Oh.
6174571	6177993	All right, let's go to the listener round table.
6177993	6180875	We want to invite you all to participate with our show.
6180875	6182937	Sometimes we get your emails.
6182937	6185438	Participate at orangelawntrading.com.
6185438	6189501	We also love to hear from you in our chat room if you have anything you want to ask.
6189501	6196686	And of course, there is always Discord, vognetwork.com slash discord if you want to say hello that way.
6196686	6197286	Let me go over.
6197286	6198827	The mailbox is empty.
6198827	6200889	Yeah, I figured that was the case.
6200889	6202129	It's a graveyard.
6202129	6202410	Yeah.
6203010	6208013	But that's that's good because you're probably not ready to use your voice all the time just yet.
6208013	6212997	So no YYR emails to test that tonight.
6212997	6216799	I will be on Dead by Daylight, but I'm not going to do very much.
6216799	6223004	And I might just switch over to Dreamlight Valley because my voice is already feeling it, if you can hear.
6223804	6225526	I have my nebulizer though.
6239601	6243186	Sj100 Matt says YYR will email about the DDR stuff soon enough.
6260216	6261417	Well, I don't know what I should say.
6261417	6265319	But I'm like, thanks to Pokemon Go.
6265319	6270122	I'm not sure why YYR would be available right now based on some things I've observed in Pokemon Go.
6270122	6271243	That's all I can say.
6271243	6276066	So but anyway, I look forward to possibly hearing from YYR next week.
6276066	6281349	So but let me see if there might be any last minute stories this week, Loki.
6281349	6282530	There is not.
6282530	6283391	Wow.
6283391	6284351	All right.
6284351	6287933	Well, it's it's gonna be a very, very busy.
6287933	6288674	Oh, yeah, Jimmy.
6290862	6292483	I just said, um, not me either.
6292483	6293543	Oh, okay.
6293543	6301967	Um, it's going to be a very, very busy week in, um, the gaming world with, uh, you know, Thanksgiving on the horizon and all these releases.
6301967	6307290	I think Super Mario RPG, lot of people going to be giving you their hot takes this weekend.
6307290	6311131	And I understand I'm probably going to be one of them, uh, really looking forward to that.
6311131	6318475	So this is, this is in a way it's kind of the, the capstone week of what has been an awesome year in game releases.
6319235	6319575	GameReleases
6344168	6346549	Review of this.
6346549	6347689	I don't think so.
6347689	6351730	There's usually not anything too big.
6351730	6357212	Sometimes Nintendo will sneak a small, small thing out, but a lot of yeah, what I'm looking at is sports.
6357212	6360813	Oh, I get the official release of Disney Dreamlight Valley.
6360813	6362033	Yeah, that's a stretch.
6362033	6364054	The Avatar game.
6364054	6365314	OK.
6365314	6366395	Is a thing, I guess.
6369724	6371249	Thanks for watching!
6377217	6379299	And be done with it and make me happy.
6379299	6381520	Yeah, I'd like to see that too, honestly.
6381520	6383101	But it's a lot of development.
6383101	6386403	A lot of people aren't releasing MMOs anymore.
6386403	6393988	You know, there's something coming from some of the folks that used to work on World of Warcraft kind of split off and did their own thing some time ago.
6393988	6397430	And I think we're supposed to, rumor is, we're supposed to see something on that.
6397430	6400392	I wonder if that's tied with the Game Awards too.
6400392	6405415	Based on some tweets and things of that nature, I feel like they're due to announce it soon.
6406595	6409256	And I wonder if that's going to be coming out of the Game Awards as well.
6409256	6410937	So it'd be very interesting.
6410937	6420201	Oh, thank you, SSJ100 Matt, for the update on the countdown timer, who says in chat, we are only 50 days away from Bobby Kotick leaving the industry.
6420201	6421001	That's great.
6421001	6421541	50 days away.
6421541	6425203	50 days too long, but the day is getting closer.
6425203	6425663	That's sure.
6427287	6430728	All right, well, we will start to wrap up the show tonight.
6430728	6433529	First, let me thank all of you for listening to the show tonight.
6433529	6438651	Thank you so much for listening, whether it was live or whether it was on the podcast feed.
6438651	6442492	We appreciate you taking a moment to check out our show and be with us this week.
6442492	6445653	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Launch Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
6445653	6450534	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but we need more voices to put out on air.
6450534	6451975	So please tell a friend or two.
6451975	6456056	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes goes an awful long way as well.
6457156	6463858	Let's go to DarkSakura, because I know you're setting up, as you just said, to do some Dead by Daylight for a little bit, and maybe some other stuff too.
6463858	6466139	You have a final thought for us tonight.
6466139	6468099	See how I feel.
6468099	6474381	My thought is don't be a shit to other people.
6474381	6477141	And listen to what people tell you.
6477141	6481042	Don't live in a echo chamber.
6481042	6482943	Just look outside of your own bias.
6485587	6489590	All right, have a good stream.
6489590	6492352	We will we will move over to Loki.
6492352	6494793	Your final thought tonight, Loki?
6494793	6500077	My final thought is I have a lot of editing to do this week.
6500077	6501798	More Minecraft videos to do, yeah?
6501798	6508282	Yeah, I got like one Channel 64 video and probably like one or two of the Deep Dark World stuff.
6508282	6509203	So it's a lot.
6509929	6511270	All right, busy, busy.
6511270	6515113	Well, I hope I hope the engagement is continuing its climb.
6515113	6517155	I know it's been a slow climb, but it's climb over there.
6517155	6520257	Yeah, it's moving up.
6520257	6526543	OK, gradually, like barely, you know, it's it's flat as flat as can be, you know.
6526543	6528724	Hey, every little bit helps.
6528724	6533668	I hope you continue to find that engagement and maybe that one thing that breaks through.
6533668	6534789	You never know.
6534789	6535410	You never know.
6535410	6536210	More shorts.
6536210	6536831	That's what it takes.
6537720	6538220	Meh.
6560828	6565111	I mean, I just figured Niantic just can't get anything right at this point.
6565111	6566412	But damn, I still play.
6566412	6568593	I still play way too much of their games.
6568593	6569314	What can I say?
6569314	6571815	I love to gamify my walks and my fitness.
6571815	6572676	It works.
6572676	6575298	So anyway, that does it, everybody.
6575298	6576218	Have a wonderful week.
6576218	6582883	We'll see you in seven days to do it all again and probably talk an awful lot about Super Mario RPG.
6582883	6587626	So I'm sure those of you that are picking that up later this week will have a lot to say about it.
6587626	6589567	So we'll talk about it next time.
6589567	6590388	Have a good night, everybody.
6590388	6590528	Bye.
