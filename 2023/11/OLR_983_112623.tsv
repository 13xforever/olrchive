9943	14767	It's not a new phenomenon that rights holders grip onto their perceived perception and maintain fervent control of their image.
14767	17829	It is new that so many people have clout to be able to do so.
17829	20531	This week brings us news involving this for Intellivision and Rockstar.
20531	27857	One of those being absurdly desperate and repeatedly inflicting damage upon themselves for what cannot possibly result in any meaningful benefit.
27857	29718	This is the We Live in a Society intro.
29718	34782	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about these topics and the rest of the quiet holiday news.
34782	36904	Starting right now on the show, River Gamer has a voice.
39212	41413	Hello my friends out there on the internet.
41413	45955	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
45955	60543	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back and live once again here tonight on our show episode number 983 for tonight, November the 26th of 2023.
60543	65265	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week with my two co-hosts.
65265	68787	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
70273	70915	Hi.
70915	72358	Hello, hello.
72358	73060	How are you doing?
73060	77029	Did you have a good day of thankfulness or at least food?
77029	77229	Eating?
80485	84528	Some of it was good, some of it was really crappy.
84528	107907	But I've been working on my VTuber since then, and fixed the ears a little bit, and made a new top, and now I am drinking a coffee with sugar-free vanilla Torani, some dark chocolate Borgata liqueur, and dark, I'm sorry, and chocolate whipped cream on top.
107907	108147	Yum!
109560	110282	Sounds good.
110282	112046	I love me some sugar-free syrups.
112046	117518	I have my own collection downstairs for our little coffee bar and the various coffees.
117518	119823	I'm not drinking coffee tonight though, yet.
119823	119943	Hmm.
120402	128047	but go, trust me, go to TJ Maxx and get your Torani there.
128047	132109	Yes, there's a, HomeGoods has like a comparable thing too.
132109	134291	So yeah, there's, you can, you can find some good deals.
134291	135632	Oh, HomeGoods has really good ones.
135632	136072	Yeah.
136072	137112	Oh yeah.
137112	141235	Every so often though, Ross will be clearing them out for two bucks a bottle.
141235	144857	Probably right, right after the holidays will be a good time to get that stuff too, for sure.
144857	146899	Oh, sometimes, sometimes during the holidays.
148159	154542	Also say hello to the spirit of the holidays here on this program, Techmaster Loki.
154542	155263	Hello.
155263	155843	Oh, ho, ho.
155843	157123	How are you?
157123	158424	I'm doing pretty good.
158424	170830	I am watching this game that's playing behind you on screen tonight because we do tape live every Sunday night at The Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash VOG Network, nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific, right after The Bobby Blackwell Show.
170830	172951	And when you do watch us live, you get to see
173331	173591	Gamefootage
195689	197150	It is somewhat newer.
197150	198391	It's not.
198391	203314	It's probably been out a few years now, but it is Enter the Gungeon House of the Gun Dead.
203314	205055	It's their arcade game.
205055	207097	Oh, I want it.
207097	208237	I want it.
208237	208638	Really?
208638	213261	It's only fifty five hundred dollars, but I want it.
213261	218384	I mean, it's a modern modern dual gun like game.
218871	222492	Maybe they'll find a way to port it to Steam or something.
222492	223473	I mean, they could.
223473	224393	It's run off PC.
224393	226514	I mean, they absolutely could.
226514	230315	But that would take the fun out of owning the arcade game.
230315	239738	Well, speaking of owning arcade games, I addressed this a little bit before we went live tonight, because Bobby Blackwolf is always kind enough to have me on his show to tease what's coming up on OLR.
239738	245460	And in the studio here where I'm at, I've actually added, thanks to Black Friday sales,
246300	255289	I don't usually get into the whole thing, but Alan and I have this weird tradition the last few years is that we go out shopping on Black Friday, but not the way everybody else does.
255289	263638	We, no, forget that whole, like, staying in line and finding people to, or, though I guess I heard, like, Black Friday was kind of not a big deal this year.
263638	265660	Not as many people go to the stores and stuff.
265660	266421	I've heard the same.
266421	267482	It was not as busy.
267802	271183	But I digress, we kept our tradition and we go at night.
271183	276144	So like Target, instead of closing at 9pm, we'll close at 10pm or I think it was 11 instead of 10, whatever.
276144	277004	But we'll go late.
277004	285907	So we went at like 9 o'clock to Target and one of the deals that they had was these little countercade arcade one-up machines.
285907	288287	Certain ones for $99.
288287	289968	So I think my choice was this Ms.
289968	290768	Pac-Man one.
290768	292869	I believe they had an NBA Jam one for $129.
294929	301670	It was a Marvel superhero, I think, one for $99.
301670	304651	Allen and I were kind of debating between those two, but ultimately I got the Ms.
304651	311712	Pac-Man one just because it also has Super Pac-Man on it, which I understand not everybody loves Super Pac-Man.
311712	320074	I just have this weird emotional... I think it's one of the first video games I remember playing with Super Pac-Man in an arcade on a Chuck E. Cheese standing on a riser to reach the controls.
321594	324976	So I was excited to have a little version of that.
324976	326437	Plus, Ms.
326437	327738	Pac-Man is pretty cool, too.
327738	328118	It's Ms.
328118	331661	Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man.
331661	333942	I think it's Galaxian, maybe?
333942	335303	It's Galaxian or Galaga.
335303	336424	It's one of the two.
336424	342768	And then there's two, like, absolute throwaway games in there from Namco, which don't... Rompers is one of them.
342768	344349	Jamie, would you know these games?
344349	346431	These are obscure Namco classics at this point.
346431	347251	Rompers, do you know that one?
347251	347791	Rompers?
347791	348412	Never heard of that.
349998	352519	Rompers?
352519	354901	Hold on, yeah, I do know that one.
354901	356322	It only came out in Japan.
356322	359964	It was a System 1 game.
359964	361985	Crap.
361985	363165	Yeah, it's kind of like...
366707	372811	you, I don't know, it kind of makes me think a little bit of Bomberman, a little bit.
372811	381216	It was like, you run around top down and like this sort of maze-like environment, but it's got little walls and things everywhere.
381216	382037	It's an interesting one.
382037	383498	It's collecting keys.
383498	386040	So it's a little bit like Super Pac-Man in that regard.
386040	388941	So I think that's the weird, like very loose connection.
388941	392324	But I, the only thing that kind of surprised me was I was like,
393124	420042	uh well i'll get to that but rompers i was like this is very like this is way newer than the other games in the collection like it doesn't like you said it runs on completely different hardware that's the weird one not an 89 yeah yeah so that's a weird one uh the other one is king and balloon is the other one that's in there i don't know if you know that one that one yeah king yeah i know that one yeah it's like um yeah uh king and balloon is like one of their like old yeah
421773	427078	It actually has a lot in common with Galaga to me, but it's a very different sort of setup.
427078	428780	But it's the same.
428780	436489	Instead of the ship kidnapping, there's the little king walks along the bottom, and the little balloons try to come kidnap him.
436489	442815	And when the best part about the game are the dumb little sound samples, when the balloon actually grabs him, he goes, help, help.
443596	459651	help help and so you have to shoot the balloon to get him down and if he gets all the way off the screen it goes bye bye so that's the funniest part of the game is the stupid little sound effects the king makes help help bye bye
461118	465640	But otherwise, it's not nearly what the other games in the collection are.
465640	468140	But it's still it was cute for $99.
468140	471141	And the best part of all, it's it's a little baby machine.
471141	477124	So it's maybe like the size, the entire thing is the size of the screen on a on a stand up cab.
477124	480785	But I would say the best thing about it, it was already assembled.
481605	488277	So it clearly comes from a different assembly factory or something or just, you know, be on the shelf to maybe attract more buyers.
488277	489800	It's already built and put together.
489800	492845	So all you have to do is plug it in and tear off the screen protector.
492845	493506	There is that too.
495404	497765	but for $99, it's cute.
497765	498465	I'm not gonna keep it.
498465	504726	You'll notice that as I'm sitting here, I don't, you kind of can't see it unless I intentionally turn around anyway.
504726	506407	I'm probably not gonna keep it there permanently.
506407	507967	That was just for show tonight.
507967	510568	I don't think it looks good next to the two larger machines.
510568	520670	So I think it's gonna go either on the opposite wall or I have a closet that's kind of off screen over here that's a walk-in closet that would actually be great for shelving and machines like that.
520670	524011	The only problem is there's no outlet in the closet
524451	526011	We have our little ghosts and goblins.
544778	547540	You got actually smaller than that.
547540	556064	I wish the listeners could see your house, though, the way you have it set up, because you really do have pinball machines everywhere.
556064	556725	It's pretty rad.
556725	558106	That's just the garage.
558106	563749	Well, I mean, we do have we moved Ghostbusters and ACDC into Dan's office.
563749	571413	And then we still have like my three in the dining room, which is World Cup Soccer, Black Knight 2000 and Theater of Magic.
571513	572013	PinballMachines
586684	588545	Holy shit, there's pinball everywhere.
588545	591145	Yeah, and don't have room for anything else.
591145	599548	That's well, that's what's starting to happen in my office and these cabinets is we're talking about maybe if we end up getting too many of these, we'll have to move them downstairs.
599548	605650	But I don't I don't know how crazy I want to get with these because they they are they do take up a lot of space.
605650	611872	Like, you know, they're really meant for, I think, larger homes than what we have in California.
611872	613253	Like, let's be real.
613253	614613	On Bobby's show, we were talking about
614993	617615	like basements and how the Ms.
617615	623260	Pac-Man thing that I bought is a perfect bar top arcade.
623260	625442	That's like where it's going to shine best.
625442	632968	Sitting in a bar, bar stool at the bar you built in your basement, you know, at playing a little game while you're having a drink.
632968	635350	That that's where this thing is going to be perfect.
635350	638233	But in California, we don't really have basements.
638493	643817	So, um, well, I guess depends what part of the state you live in, but most, most, we don't have basements.
643817	647420	And, um, yeah, it's just, it takes up a lot of room.
647420	647580	So.
648703	654326	I would like if this was my parents old house, my parents used to have an outdoor patio.
654326	657228	And this would be perfect for a setup like that.
657228	661591	So like someday when Alan and I move and have a bigger place, it'll probably make a lot more sense.
661591	663292	I won't just have them behind me.
663292	668435	But for now, while I'm continuing all this streaming and stuff, I like they make they make for good ambience.
668435	672217	I like watching the little burgers drop behind me on burger time in the background.
672217	674959	And of course, Tron, even though the joystick kind of blocks
675379	675819	Thanks for watching!
682614	684836	It was, of course, a holiday week here in the States.
684836	691021	I know not everywhere has Thanksgiving because Canada's Thanksgiving was last month and other countries don't.
691021	699988	But here in the States, we had Thanksgiving and it's a pretty big deal because a lot of offices pretty much closed just about for the entire week.
699988	703450	I mean, yes, people work and not every industry, right?
703450	705232	There's always going to be industries that are working.
705572	706693	News is a little lighter this week.
721286	724030	But we do have a few things to get into tonight.
724030	727855	So it's probably going to be a little shorter of a show, but I said that last week and it was about the same length.
727855	731479	So it just depends on how much we get into some of these topics tonight.
731479	737567	So let's start with this tonight, because this is a little more of what people are talking about on social media.
738508	745672	And it's some comments that were made by the publisher of Spirit Tea.
745672	747053	Spirit Tea?
747053	748354	Spirit Tea.
748354	752597	I don't know how you would say that, but Spirit Tea is a rural sim.
752597	759401	So it's, I guess in some ways you could say it's right in the Stardew Valley train, or if you will, Animal Crossing, you know, the sim train.
759401	760962	There's a big market for sims.
760962	765865	But it's more inspired by Studio Ghibli films, specifically Spirited Away.
766505	770746	Development costs have been made back three times over and there are plans to expand the game.
784751	796875	However, the founder of the publisher of the game No More Robots, Mike Rose, went onto a thread on Twitter to talk about the launch of the game.
796875	809260	And most of the posts were talked about the reception and the sales, but there was a particular section of the posts that got a little bit of pushback because it was talking about coverage from influencers and YouTube.
810300	820949	and in the tweets he writes, a hugeably noticeable thing that happened during this launch was that we got absolutely zero YouTube coverage at all.
820949	825312	Go search Spirit Tea on YouTube and you'll see there's just a couple of big videos.
825312	828715	Nearly every YouTuber who got back to us wanted money to make a video.
829295	837762	Now, you'll note that actually on YouTube, there were a handful of videos that did have several thousand views each on them.
837762	842046	So it wasn't quite accurate to say zero YouTube coverage at all.
842046	847311	And I think it's more these next few tweets that come into play with the why he made the comment the way he did.
848351	853833	Now look, I get it.
853833	855274	That's just how this works now.
855274	857815	YouTubers want you to pay them to cover your games.
857815	858856	Alright, sure.
858856	860196	But I just don't want to do that.
860196	864058	It feels weird and icky and disingenuous and I just can't do it.
864058	866459	So I guess our games won't get covered on YouTube anymore.
867139	880485	Of course, the fact that we still managed a 1 million launch without any influencer support makes me think, what could we have achieved if I just paid some, or excuse me, let me get this right, quote, what could we have achieved if I did pay some people?
880485	886848	So maybe I'll be forced to do it in the future, but God, I just really don't want to.
886848	890489	It's so F Qbert speak to hide the word fucking.
890489	891550	It's so fucking enough.
892350	893631	So that was it.
893631	905398	And of course, as you may suspect, some people decided to clap back, as they do on social media that's easily accessible, like Twitter, saying that, hey, work goes into creating videos for these games.
905398	909601	Content creators deserve to be paid for their time, and so on and so on.
909601	915545	And I want to say in a follow-up tweet, even since I saw this article, I want to say I saw something about
915845	917225	Yeah, there's a screenshot.
917225	918646	Actually, let me show this.
918646	922007	I'm going to go to here live so you all can see.
922007	932250	Those that are watching can actually see that there's even a screenshot within the tweets that were posted that show like 41k views, 10k views.
932250	935611	I would kill for these numbers, just for the record, okay?
935611	937652	I would kill for viewer numbers like this, just saying.
938032	944397	But how nice that your brand new game got 41,000 views on a video.
944397	951442	I'd like to now show Exhibit A of my game getting no views on YouTube.
952625	954327	There you go.
954327	955348	There is that.
955348	955749	There is that.
955749	957071	I'm sorry.
957071	962778	You know, influencers playing games on YouTube is considered advertising.
962778	968165	And as advertising goes for a game, you can do one of two things.
968165	968946	You could either
969466	975469	You know, have it grassroots where you do the marketing yourself for that or you pay someone to advertise for you.
975469	977069	That is just how it works.
977069	978530	I'm sorry you don't like that.
978530	983272	I'm sorry you thought your game was so good that all of the big YouTubers out there would go, oh, look at this one game.
983272	984513	I need to go play this right now.
984513	987254	Well, guess what ain't going to happen because there are.
987654	990995	There are thousands of games out there that people are interested in.
990995	998537	And if they don't think it's going to be the next big thing and you haven't, you know, whipped them up into a frenzy about it, then they're not going to do it organically.
998537	1002178	And you have to have sponsored, you know, coverage of your game.
1002178	1003898	And lots of games do that.
1003898	1011980	Even larger games like, for example, Cities Skylines 2 did a massive campaign with influencers to help promote their game.
1011980	1016021	It is not necessarily like a dirty thing to do it, but like, I feel that
1016781	1018642	You feel like you're above all of that.
1018642	1022784	Like, yeah, I would have loved to see people play my game.
1022784	1024825	It's, you know, relatively cheap.
1024825	1026846	You can play a free version of it and stuff like that.
1026846	1036971	But I also know that it is such a niche title that it is not something that anybody's just gonna pick up and play and let's like, haha, that's weird, you know, that type of thing.
1036971	1038532	So like, I just don't
1039840	1042642	It's a lot of entitlement coming through on those posts there.
1042642	1043302	And that's fine.
1043302	1044342	You can share your opinion.
1044342	1045863	I feel it's icky and I don't want to do that.
1045863	1046504	OK, cool.
1046504	1052086	Then you can't complain, though, when people aren't playing your game online because you didn't pay for that coverage.
1052086	1053507	So you get what you get.
1053507	1054528	That's that's the irony.
1054528	1055988	They are playing it without that.
1055988	1062072	So, you know, yeah, but he's just upset that his game's like not number one on Twitch or something stupid like that.
1062072	1062232	So.
1062972	1067655	Let me get to the apology because it is important to, you know, get all ends of this.
1067655	1069897	So there was an apology that was posted.
1069897	1071498	And this is actually the last tweet he's made.
1071498	1073159	He hasn't tweeted since then.
1073159	1075840	He put, Hey, everyone, I've really fucked up here.
1075840	1077201	No Qbert speak that time.
1077201	1078582	And I'm massively sorry.
1078582	1080243	I've been reading your comments and replies.
1080243	1082045	And it's clear that I've completely missed the mark.
1082905	1088828	I absolutely value the work that YouTubers and content creators do and my words didn't reflect that at all.
1088828	1094292	I'm going to be reading loads more on all this and get better educated so I can be less of a dickhead in the future.
1094292	1109240	So at least he kind of says, okay, I was a dick, you know, like I, there was a way I could have better worded that, which to me, yes, that's, that's the issue here is that there's a way this is, this is one of those things where I actually don't totally have a problem with what he said.
1109240	1110741	I have a problem with how he said it.
1111161	1136682	and Jamie you even like called like the minute it happened you said well he's already used hyperbole right there like yes like he's contradicting himself like as he goes right there with the screenshots and so forth and i think it felt like he was really trying to calling himself a dick isn't isn't hyperbole yeah well but but like you know with some of those things he was saying there he was like actually contradicting himself like with the screenshot or whatever and and so forth
1137342	1146131	I understand if he feels a certain kind of way about paying YouTubers to create the content, I understand why he feels like he shouldn't have to do that.
1146131	1152257	And I maybe I'm gonna put my foot in my mouth, but I kind of agree with the notion that like,
1154458	1157720	If you don't want to pay YouTubers to cover the thing, then don't.
1157720	1163905	But understand, they may not cover the thing and it may not hit the thing of their channel.
1163905	1169909	I kind of disagree with the pushback from the YouTube community that content creators need to get paid.
1170849	1175270	Yes, you do need to get paid, not that part, but where are you getting paid from?
1175270	1181131	The advertisements, the people viewing, your community, the merchandise, everything that goes into that.
1181131	1192573	Because when I'm looking at this, I look at it akin to a television show, like a more traditional type of talk show, like we'll say the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
1192573	1195454	I don't care how you feel about him, just hear me out for my example.
1195894	1197336	The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
1197336	1201422	His guests don't pay to come on that program, right?
1201422	1203746	They're not paying, but they're getting paid.
1203746	1204286	They are guests.
1205325	1205585	are
1227085	1230527	The Disney movie is not making the money.
1230527	1232109	Well, but the Disney movie isn't.
1232109	1234450	And again, nobody could promote it because of the strike.
1234450	1239394	And a lot of movies out right now are not doing too hot because of the strike.
1239394	1244678	They weren't being promoted, which I understand why the strike obviously was a necessary thing.
1244678	1246719	But I'm just saying it's part of that.
1246719	1250882	When you cut that part out of the equation, it did show potentially.
1250882	1255045	I mean, I guess we'll never really know in some of the box office numbers and so forth.
1255405	1273626	yeah and if it's something that's like it has to do with cost even you could do the legwork and go find people out there that play those same similar genre of games and say hey i noticed that your channel plays that you play a lot of these types of games on your channel here's a key to my game that's it that's you know
1274826	1280749	I feel this is something that you might be interested in playing and checking out and I'd love to hear your feedback on it.
1280749	1289632	And so that would be a way I would approach it because like, sure, I'm not going to be able to do that to Markiplier or something like that and expect gameplay to happen.
1291105	1297329	That's how you advertise it out there, a smaller grassroots type of marketing.
1297329	1306476	However, if you are expecting a Markiplier or equivalent-sized YouTubers to be playing this game just because their game exists,
1307506	1308307	DarkSakura
1322890	1326052	The three of us have been creating content a very long time, obviously.
1326052	1327813	And I'm not delusional.
1327813	1331896	I know we don't have the audience that many, many other places do.
1331896	1338100	We're a long-running but small show, and we love our little audience that we have here and our little family and all that.
1338100	1340122	And I'm trying to think, even at the height
1341042	1342883	of podcast mania.
1342883	1357750	When we were one of the only gaming podcasts on iTunes for about a year before all the corporations caught on and saturated the market, when that was going on, I would say at most we would maybe get the occasional free game in the mail.
1357750	1360171	I can think of promo copies of games we would get in the mail.
1361391	1363912	or other promo things.
1363912	1384856	I think the most I ever saw a peer got offered is because this can absolutely kind of control and be used to influence too, was I saw a peer that, and I don't want to make it sound like the peer did anything, because they absolutely did nothing wrong in this equation or anything, but they got travel
1385316	1408053	to go to this company's place and play the new game and take a lot of parting gifts and prizes away with the game which again that's how you know you get people's attention because they literally by flying somebody out to a particular location you had essentially a captive audience in that location for a while again it's it's
1408934	1418698	And even though I say like, oh, it was a peer and that whole thing at that time, that kind of thing still goes on, FYI, still goes on for newer games.
1418698	1424961	It's just we're not invited to them anymore because, you know, nobody cares about podcasts and all that stuff, or at least podcasts this small.
1424961	1430323	So that's my point, is that those are other ways that influencing happens, right?
1430323	1432344	But that's about the most that I've seen.
1432344	1437906	Getting paid outright to discuss something on the show, I'm trying to think if we've ever even been offered that.
1439930	1444191	I think in a sly way.
1444191	1446332	In a sly way.
1446332	1450133	That's about it.
1450133	1452094	And usually we're pretty good about seeing through that kind of stuff.
1452094	1453954	Usually we've had to be the one to reach out to other people.
1453954	1455095	Yeah.
1455095	1455555	But anyway.
1456961	1458823	I agree with Loki's approach there.
1458823	1465708	If you do a little bit of research and say, see, oh, here are the companies that seem to or here are the places that seem to kind of like your game.
1465708	1467689	Here's you know, you know, a key or whatever.
1467689	1468810	I think that's the way to do it.
1468810	1471872	You give away free copies of the game in order to get people talking.
1471872	1475034	Okay, let me go to chat over twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
1475034	1478157	Okay, Bobby Black will visit chat and Bobby is saying, I can say
1478777	1484793	that Bobby was the one that actually flew up to Seattle for the Halo 3 launch because he's told this story on his show before.
1484793	1487059	I actually wasn't only thinking of Bobby because I thought
1488024	1491805	some other peers of ours in podcasting were also invited to that.
1491805	1500647	So that's why I kept it a little vague as I was not wanting to make it about any one particular person, but just an example of this is something else.
1500647	1505348	This is about the most I've ever kind of come in contact with as an influencer.
1505348	1508709	So anyway, Bobby says, okay, so my take.
1509750	1514454	In the time when I was reviewing games, the payment was I got a free game.
1514454	1518978	Even that was considered too much bribery for some people, but I digress.
1518978	1522321	However, that was for a review and you wouldn't want to pay off a critic.
1522321	1525064	But today, most influencers aren't direct reviewers.
1525524	1530227	So you need to start looking at it as paying for airtime instead of getting a review.
1530227	1534889	Today, influencers are playing the game and letting the audience decide their own review.
1534889	1538911	So in that sense, it is more like buying airtime on a popular TV channel.
1538911	1540432	You aren't buying a review.
1540432	1545215	The publisher still believes the only coverage is a review with a score and the landscape has changed.
1545215	1548757	I will say to that end, there's much more than just reviews.
1548757	1549357	And I have seen
1549477	1549577	and
1570094	1582324	that I am a fan of, that I get emails saying you should play this game that came out a few years ago that's available that they're always kind of trying to push promotions for, and all this type of thing.
1582324	1586167	And I assume you probably have gotten similar sorts of emails, DarkSakura.
1586167	1589690	There's also websites that... Go ahead.
1591400	1595464	I was going to say, most of the time I get it through stream elements, I'll be honest.
1595464	1600668	You know, hey, we want these sponsored things because we also get a thing out of it.
1600668	1601629	Yay, good for us.
1601629	1610297	Yeah, and to be clear, I think I'm getting targeted through one of those things too, because I'm on that website and then another one that was called Rainmaker that I signed up for because I was attempting to get a key for
1611798	1617722	A very popular game that I knew I was going to buy day one anyway, but I thought, what the hell, I'm going to stream this game.
1617722	1618723	Let's see if I can get a key.
1618723	1621485	I did not get a key for it, by the way, so that's why I never.
1621485	1623166	No, but I tried.
1623166	1625948	So I have a site.
1625948	1632712	I do get beta offers, though, from I mean, I'm not going to say what they were for, but I've gotten some from Behavior.
1632712	1634854	I was in the beta for Meet Your Maker.
1636821	1639623	I've gotten a couple from Capcom.
1639623	1643725	The thing is that I'm on a Mac.
1643725	1649228	Although Capcom is getting more Mac support, but I've also had to put myself out there.
1651636	1654259	So it's a combination of two things.
1654259	1663207	It's not just your innate popularity, but you also have to kind of market yourself to be included with some of that.
1663207	1670254	But it is it is an interesting point with all that kind of like what Bobby said at the end there about it's not really the landscapes changed.
1670254	1671755	It's not about reviews anymore.
1671755	1674598	It's about people playing the games, which I actually
1675118	1679540	I watch people I trust on Twitch or even YouTube playing a game because I know it's not filtered.
1690123	1699431	They're playing and I see an unfiltered sort of gameplay and impressions and I make my decision from there because I kind of, I don't really care about reviews.
1699431	1703334	Like they might be fun as a barometer, but that's about it.
1703334	1707478	Otherwise I could give a hoot what such and such person said about a game because we're not always going to agree.
1709154	1710615	I love Diablo 4.
1710615	1711896	Not everybody does.
1711896	1716900	I understand my tastes are different than other people's, so there's never going to be reviews that completely line up.
1716900	1725606	So I sort of feel like, you know, watching that raw gameplay and somebody, you know, I appreciate watching, playing it, is going to do more for me than anything else.
1726806	1728367	This is kind of where I am with that.
1728367	1741775	I'll catch a few clips and things when I'm on YouTube, and then if I watch a clip and it strikes me as interesting, then I'll go and look more for it.
1744123	1757712	Questbuster with a comment in our chat says, with as much decision that comes as YouTube and Twitch influencers for what they do from certain quarters, it's still big, big business with each one acting like a self-contained cable network.
1757712	1769521	The hugely successful ones with a lot of eyeballs dictate their own schedules and squeezing into those can come with a cost, as Blackwolf pointed out earlier, buying a moment of their valuable airtime.
1769901	1779823	You know what, though, to the guy's point from Spirit Tea, you know, I understand if he feels ick about paying for airtime, that's that's a fine opinion to have.
1780595	1786041	But sometimes you don't want to say the quiet part out loud, especially as loudly as he said.
1786041	1793809	I think there was a better way to phrase that with like, Hey, we want to thank you for this amazing, incredible support that we've had behind this game.
1793809	1796252	We were able to accomplish all of this.
1796252	1801418	And he, I think if even if we went so far as to say, and we did not have to pay for coverage.
1801798	1804038	from certain outlets.
1804038	1808519	I think that would have been a fine thing to say, is that we did not have to pay for coverage.
1808519	1811000	Thank you to the community who has helped carry this game.
1811000	1815681	And I think you could have carried the message in a much more positive way.
1815681	1822582	I get that not everything always has to be sugarcoated, but I think sometimes when it's your brand that you're representing, you kind of do a little bit.
1822582	1827443	Because if you show that ugly side and then start to, unfortunately,
1828163	1831946	very much show that you're speaking in hyperbole and all this.
1831946	1839591	Like, I think it just I think it devalues your game at the end of the day, although this game seems to be doing just fine.
1839591	1841692	And honestly, think about it.
1841692	1843473	Here we are talking about it.
1843473	1846615	I'm not sure this game would have been on my radar otherwise.
1846615	1850798	And that goes back to the argument about is.
1850798	1854261	Bad press really that bad sometimes?
1854261	1854661	I don't know.
1855891	1859872	This post just was like very KvetchFest, you know.
1859872	1860592	Yeah.
1860592	1861873	The first one.
1861873	1865354	Well, like, yeah, all this is great, but it but I want everything.
1865354	1867935	It's very Veruca Salt.
1867935	1870316	Well, it's just it's just not what you would expect to see.
1870316	1871476	I want reviews.
1871476	1872236	From a publisher.
1872236	1873557	I want them for free.
1875575	1885984	Well, I mean, you could say the same thing also in the content creator space, like you could say, Hey, I put out a product that is a very high quality product.
1885984	1889828	Why isn't the YouTube algorithm pushing my content?
1889828	1895813	You know, like, you can make the same argument that you can complain about it, how you don't want to advertise because that's dirty.
1896195	1902360	Oh, I thought I thought you were gonna go to the the cookie incident with Pokimane and that whole thing I've been reading about.
1902360	1904302	Oh, that's expensive.
1904302	1905783	Just stop being poor.
1905783	1909587	I'm paraphrasing the hysteria behind that.
1909587	1910427	I'm not.
1910427	1911288	Okay.
1911288	1922658	I mean, to understand that yes, people that live lives that they are they're taking a lot of money, whether it be in the content creation space, whether it be just, you know,
1923405	1927788	influencers or whatever the housewives of Beverly Hills did to get their money.
1927788	1928348	Who knows?
1928348	1928989	Married rich?
1928989	1929789	I don't know.
1929789	1939415	But like it is with some understanding that yes, they are not in the loop as far as how the common folk live and stuff.
1939415	1943418	And so there's a lot of those comments that come out from that.
1943418	1944618	So that I understand.
1944618	1948521	I don't really care too much, but I'm also like not buying her cookies.
1948521	1949982	I didn't intend to go there.
1950722	1953383	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1970991	1973452	So, but again, it's how you say it, right?
1973452	1988500	And honestly, it was like an offhanded comment to a chatter that of course, in this, because everybody's attention span has been completely diluted by Twitter and the 140 characters, 280 characters, whatever it is, now we only live in these second.
1988500	1991282	And so that little clip is all people see.
1991282	1996825	And now everybody's got an opinion of her based on one hyperbole did not land well clip.
1997461	2009507	And to be fair, like, apparently the cookies are, like, these, like, gluten-free, like, special, like, health cookies, I guess, if you will, like, that normally they are more expensive anyways.
2009507	2021953	That said, though, still wouldn't buy them from her because, one, ew, healthy cookies, no, and two, um, you know, it's just overpriced stuff from influencers, and there's cookies literally all around me.
2021953	2025275	I can, I can get cookies delivered to me from wherever, I mean, so,
2025655	2037503	And two, it's not even just about her because what Mr. Beast had a cookie thing and he had a whole thing about, oh, just if you see my cookies on the shelves at Walmart, fix them up, you know, that that whole thing as well.
2037503	2037663	Yeah.
2037663	2038224	Remember that?
2038224	2039144	Yeah.
2039144	2041686	Well, what is it about influencers and cookies?
2041686	2042326	Do we need to know?
2042326	2044928	It's not it's not about cookies and stuff.
2044928	2049211	And he has a bunch of different food products which aren't there in varying levels of good.
2049211	2050292	Some of them are pretty good.
2051975	2056137	His burgers suck, but that could be from the ghost kitchen thing.
2056137	2060058	His peanut butter chocolate bars are pretty darn good, I'm just gonna say that.
2060058	2065200	His chocolate may be fine, I haven't tried it, nor do I care to.
2067406	2067626	I don't
2083868	2086892	clothing lines will have their own food, you know.
2086892	2090977	When you say merchandising, my head immediately, without fail, DarkSakura.
2090977	2091718	I know.
2091718	2093760	That's exactly, I know you do it too.
2093760	2095623	Without fail, we go to Spaceballs.
2095623	2098166	Merchandising, merchandising, merchandising.
2098166	2099728	I mean, it is true though.
2099728	2101330	Spaceballs, the flamethrower.
2101790	2116989	like if for example like you have a which is a thing that that asshole at Twitter did was put out a flamethrower so like it's it's like it's it's Mel Brooks IRL like it's wild anyway sorry yeah I mean it's
2118170	2121331	It's just them having to make a living, because they have to.
2121331	2123092	They have to survive to make a living.
2123092	2145360	I mean, certainly some of them are more thriving than others, but even smaller YouTube content creators or Twitch content creators have to look at Patreon, have to look at merchandising and that type of stuff to supplement the money that they're getting, because you don't know when, oh hey, we decided as Twitch, we just are going to keep all of the money now.
2146402	2152273	How else is Mr. Beast gonna beat Netflix to the Squid Game IRL thing if he doesn't sell some fucking cookies?
2152273	2154017	I mean...
2156397	2158457	I hear that's not good either.
2158457	2159638	The new one.
2159638	2162298	The wild thing is, I swear to God, the world's getting smaller.
2162298	2166359	Because you know, I've played these like, fakie survivor games online and stuff, right?
2166359	2168940	So I get connected to like fans of the shows.
2168940	2181923	Like, I incidentally know through friends of friends, like at least three people that are on that squid game thing, like not directly, but like, just like, oh, a friend of mine who's super into the stuff to like has a friend who auditioned and got it because there's so many fucking people on that show.
2182403	2187527	There's like 456 people on the squid game show, which is like an hour long episode thing, right?
2187527	2198516	And I'm just sitting here laughing as I'm like, if I tried to go on that squid game show, I would be relegated to someone who got shot tripping over my own two feet while trying to do the red light green light thing because I'm a dumb klutz.
2198516	2201218	Like I just it would have been a gigantic waste of time.
2201678	2209400	Tell you right now, I wouldn't be I wouldn't be caught during the red light part squatting down because I would get back up from that.
2209400	2211220	Do you know why that happened?
2211220	2212120	Do you know why that happened?
2212120	2215121	Because it's edited for TV, right?
2215121	2226983	But the thing was, when they were playing that game, that game went on in the freezing cold because it was like an air hangar in it was shot overseas in not London, but somewhere in like the London metro area.
2226983	2230864	It was shot overseas and it took seven hours.
2231144	2231224	for
2249551	2251732	So she didn't think it through and she stopped.
2251732	2255753	If it was a normal game of Red Light, Green Light, yes, you're going to be in that pose for 15 seconds.
2255753	2265136	But see now, I'm actually so glad you brought that up because here is that great example of how now Twitter culture
2265976	2272803	And the flash second tells a totally different story than what actually happened, right?
2272803	2280812	Reality TV is infamous for this, for one, because A, it took a seven-hour game of Red Light, Green Light and compressed it down to 20 minutes or whatever the fuck it was on the show.
2280812	2281973	I actually didn't watch the show.
2281973	2286358	I have been following all of this through Friends of Friends and Discord and all this other stuff.
2287739	2296724	And then it gets relegated to Twitters and video clips and clips of people going, why would she yield down?
2296724	2297745	LOL, that's so dumb.
2297745	2301287	But it's like when you know the whole story, it's like, oh, it makes sense.
2301287	2301768	No, I get it.
2301768	2304109	They were like interviewing people and stuff like that.
2305470	2311136	You would think that they would do that after the fact, like, oh, hey, what was your thought process here or something like that?
2311136	2313378	Not just like, hey, let's do that all in the middle.
2313378	2319064	It's like it sounds very amateurish, which is surprising considering that, you know.
2319064	2322308	Someone non Netflix pulled it off even better.
2322308	2323289	I just think that's funny.
2323717	2326498	Yeah, it's just it's very it's very interesting.
2326498	2332780	And like and here's the other thing that too, that's also surprising about that is like, why didn't they do like different games?
2332780	2338422	Because like the whole I haven't even watched it yet, but like I heard like was second episode or whatever.
2338422	2339383	It's all the same game.
2339383	2344165	So the twist is like, oh, the shapes of the thing and don't pick the umbrella.
2344165	2346846	But wouldn't you know that if you've already watched the show?
2346846	2348906	So like none of this is surprising.
2348906	2350367	Like, I don't I don't know.
2350367	2352988	It seems dumb.
2352988	2353088	So.
2353451	2354177	I can't with people.
2354682	2355503	I know, I know.
2355503	2356463	But anyway, it's interesting.
2356463	2366470	The discussion on that show has been everywhere this week, but I guess because it's a slow news week for a lot of areas, this was actually a really good week to release something like that, because people don't have anything better to talk about, I guess.
2366470	2369572	So but anyway, all right.
2369572	2376597	Moving on, let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you have been playing this week.
2376597	2380239	Maybe you've gotten into some stuff with the extra days off, or I don't know, who knows.
2380239	2381540	But let's go around and talk.
2381540	2382441	How was your gaming week?
2382441	2383821	So DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
2383821	2384442	How was your gaming week?
2386603	2390946	I pretty much just played Dead by Daylight and Disney Dreamlight Valley.
2390946	2396869	I actually put it to a vote last night if I was going to do Retro Night or just play Dreamlight Valley and people were like, Dreamlight Valley.
2396869	2399331	I'm like, OK.
2399331	2402693	But I did pick up Pocky and Rocky Reloaded.
2404784	2410765	the remake for the Switch because it was on Amazon for $12.
2410765	2412866	Haven't played it yet.
2412866	2426709	We had people over for our, you know, post-Thanksgiving whatever thing, and there was some Ossman going on in the house, and a few other games.
2426709	2426949	So,
2427549	2432811	It was, uh, it was pretty, pretty gamealicious, you know, in that respect.
2432811	2437733	And I played some Weird Al, you know, so it was cool.
2437733	2441415	Oh, and we did, we did watch all of Scott Pilgrim.
2441415	2448018	And we had to stop for a moment, rewind to go, yes, yes, that's Weird Al.
2448018	2448518	Yes, it was.
2448518	2448898	Yeah.
2448898	2449958	I caught his name in the credits.
2449958	2451119	Yeah.
2451119	2451359	Awesome.
2451758	2454379	Yeah, but it was so good.
2454379	2455120	I need to watch it.
2455120	2456160	It was so good.
2456160	2457101	It looks good.
2457101	2459682	Yeah, I guess I'll also- It was really good.
2459682	2461843	I'll also bring up that I also finished it.
2461843	2467665	So I had talked last week on the show that I'd started it with a friend and we got together on Wednesday night to finish it and watch the last three episodes.
2467665	2469006	And yeah, I enjoyed it.
2469006	2473608	The last two episodes got a little, and again, I want to be careful how much I say for, you know, spoiler.
2473608	2478851	The last two episodes started to get to a little bit of a weird place, but I did like
2479471	2488263	And how can I say this without spoilering, I did like, sort of like an observation that Ramona made about herself at the end.
2488263	2494752	Because I think one of the complaints that people say about the movie was that Ramona was kind of an unlikable character in the movie.
2495914	2510236	and I do think the TV show gave her a lot more depth and I think you walk away from the TV show, you know, with a much, I mean it's a very different way the character's done so it's a much different opinion I think.
2510817	2511658	The musical cameo?
2534179	2544552	If you are an old school anime fan, if you grew up importing your fan subs or buying VHS in the late 80s to mid 90s, it's a treat.
2544552	2544632	Yeah.
2551312	2553895	And for the record, I still know the lyrics.
2572639	2575540	BobbyInChat says, it's Netflix, it won't get a second season.
2575540	2576661	True.
2576661	2580022	Sj100mat says, it doesn't sound like they're making a second season, but I hope they do one.
2580022	2585945	Well, they definitely, they definitely made a very obvious gateway to a second season if they wanted to do one.
2585945	2586565	But we'll see.
2586565	2588426	Yeah, I mean, it is Netflix.
2588426	2591167	And it was a pretty impressive voice cast they got together.
2591167	2595149	And I think it's not going to work unless they get the whole voice cast back together.
2595149	2596269	So I hope, but we'll see.
2596269	2597690	I'm glad they got everybody.
2597690	2598270	Yeah, me too.
2598270	2599611	And I think that's part of what makes it work.
2601952	2607413	Everyone said they had a really fun time doing it.
2607413	2610754	So I don't think it would be too far off to get everybody back.
2610754	2612374	Let's hope.
2612374	2613655	All right.
2613655	2614435	Let's go to you, Loki.
2614435	2616615	How was your game week?
2616615	2621137	I mainly played Minecraft.
2621137	2623837	And by mainly, I mean, I only played Minecraft.
2623837	2629479	I did watch a lot of fellow Channel 64 cast member people
2629943	2632364	playing Half-Life 1 multiplayer.
2632364	2636224	And so I was like essentially playing it because I watched it for like a few hours.
2636224	2639465	But that looks like old school fun.
2639465	2640665	I love the maps on that.
2640665	2646647	And plus they added more maps for this whole 25th anniversary update thing.
2646647	2648007	It looked like a lot of fun.
2648007	2649107	So I may check that out.
2649107	2650267	I did purchase that as well.
2650267	2657729	I made a few purchases because, you know, Steam sale, you know, got to get my Earth Defense Force and stuff from Wishlist.
2658191	2665002	I bought the Scott Pilgrim Remastered for $5 because after watching the series, my friend was like, we should play through the Scott Pilgrim video game.
2665002	2665783	I was like, yeah, sure.
2665783	2667606	Just to listen to the music again, I would.
2667606	2668367	On Steam.
2671365	2672826	What did, what did, on Steam?
2672826	2677907	Okay, because I've got it like on Switch, Steam, everything.
2677907	2689071	Um, but there, actually there's, uh, there's a, uh, Limited Run, I think it was Limited Run, had, uh, uh, album, vinyl album, like, left over from a convention thing for sale.
2689071	2689411	Oh, fun.
2691957	2697260	Alright, well my gaming week was also mostly one game focused and it yet again was Diablo 4.
2697260	2701342	However, landmark achievement, I finished the battle pass this week.
2701342	2710647	So I've been kind of making the most of the experience buff that they had in the game this week, the 35% boost to XP, to try to get my character about as far as I can.
2710647	2711467	I'm up to level 89 now.
2712888	2714930	If I play after the show tonight, that's if.
2714930	2721997	I'll probably get up to level 90, but if it reverts back to normal XP, I'm not sure I want to go all the way to 100.
2721997	2725740	I think it's time for me to make sure I tackle other games in my backlog, because I have a lot.
2725740	2729203	But I think if they do an event for the holidays,
2729884	2735306	again, around, you know, the time between Christmas and New Year tends to be another kind of down period.
2735306	2743869	And because this season of Diablo isn't set to end until mid January, I wonder if they won't do an experience boost between Christmas and New Year's.
2743869	2747251	So if they do, I'll go back and top off at level 100.
2747251	2750392	But otherwise, I actually think I'm kind of done with the season.
2750392	2752653	I had a good time, but I unlocked everything in the battle pass.
2752653	2753613	And yeah, I think I'm good.
2753613	2755474	I'm good at this point.
2755474	2755574	Um,
2756414	2767738	because I have to catch up on the rest of my backlog, which includes things like Super Mario RPG, which I installed on my Switch this week because I went and I took advantage of the Costco deal and bought another voucher.
2767738	2770739	So I have Mario RPG ready to go.
2770739	2771859	So I want to play that.
2771859	2781143	I'm still really wanting to play Alan Wake Control, Alan Wake 2 in that order and tackle that because that's been in my backlog forever.
2781143	2783944	At least the first two games there have been.
2783944	2784424	So there's that.
2784804	2786245	I have been playing other little things.
2786245	2787826	Like, for example, of course, I picked up the Ms.
2787826	2788887	Pac-Man arcade cabinet.
2788887	2789828	So yes, I play Ms.
2789828	2793151	Pac-Man and Super Pac-Man, my two faves that are in that.
2793151	2801477	I also, you know, even though I don't talk about it every week on the show, I do continue to play location-based games, you know, for fitness.
2801477	2805520	I'm almost level 82 in Pikmin Bloom, which is pretty far along.
2805520	2807562	It's a lot of walking and a lot of flower planting.
2808062	2808962	and Bobby Blackwolf!
2825347	2829491	It's kind of neat that we have the whole like remote raiding for lack of a better term now.
2829491	2830292	So that's kind of fun.
2830292	2833995	I went out and I walked around quite a bit yesterday.
2833995	2836298	I walked five miles yesterday.
2836298	2840181	And during that I was playing community day for Pokemon.
2840181	2844646	I was Bluetooth catching so I wasn't in my phone the entire time you know trying to catch but it was I
2847188	2852670	was able to catch like seven shiny Mareeps as if I needed shiny Mareeps, but whatever, it's a thing to do.
2852670	2856872	And I've still been enjoying Monster Hunter now a little bit.
2856872	2869256	The difficulty definitely amps up at a certain point, but I'm up to level 51 in Monster Hunter now, and I don't ever get into Monster Hunter games, but this one's fun, and it's actually really good.
2870897	2879941	Once you are able to team up with people, the multiplayer actually works better in this than like any other like GPS mobile game that I've played.
2879941	2881881	It's pretty, pretty fun.
2881881	2885943	Wow, Bobby in chat is saying, Pikmin Bloom made me walk more often.
2885943	2891305	We've been to a bunch of parks near us that we had never gone to before, even though we've lived here for five years.
2891305	2893146	That was me when I first discovered Ingress.
2893766	2895008	where all the portals were.
2895008	2899773	I was like, I never knew there was a church back here, or I didn't know there was a thing here.
2899773	2910324	And that's to be fair, for all the criticism that Niantic has gotten over the decisions they've made in Pokemon Go, and rightfully so, I'm not saying, but I will say those are the moments
2910965	2913906	And Bobby in chat points out what I also believe is the best part of Pikmin Bloom.
2934713	2939355	Pikmin Bloom is great for me because it's more passive than Pogo or Ingress.
2939355	2941417	You do all your playing after the walk.
2941417	2945319	Yes, that's why I think that game is actually Niantic.
2945319	2947360	I think it's Niantic's strongest title right now.
2947360	2950481	I know people are going to say, it's Pokemon Go that makes all the money.
2950481	2952122	That doesn't mean it's my favorite.
2952122	2956885	I like that Pikmin Bloom is, you're right, you do all your playing after the fact.
2956885	2958686	You check in, you set it,
2959534	2960335	Thank you for watching!
2972878	2977722	Alright, a couple other things I want to mention for Gaming Weeks and this part of the show.
2977722	2998019	I want to call everybody's attention to our website, vognetwork.com, because we haven't had a written review in quite some time, but our pal PodCulture, from the appropriately named show PodCulture, that did about 540 episodes, I want to say, of their program before they called it a day,
2999460	3010349	PodCulture actually came to the website and wrote a review on the Atari 2600+, which we talked about on this show, is that device that actually plays the old Atari cartridges.
3010349	3015914	This was the announcement that kind of had us going, wow, Atari seems to be on kind of an interesting path again.
3015914	3024081	Like they were making some real questionable decisions for a little bit, but this is the kind of stuff that this and the Digital Eclipse purchase and all that, it's kind of like, oh, Atari's interesting.
3024401	3028583	So Brad from PodCulture actually picked one of these up, took a ton of pictures.
3028583	3029524	It's all up on the website.
3029524	3032305	So check that out, that review over at vognetwork.com.
3032305	3039809	I also want to give a shout out one more time to our pals over at the Twitch channel, A Tale of D20s.
3039809	3045471	That's all one word, A Tale of D20s, because I did the second half.
3045471	3050474	We did a two shot of the Masks is the Game by a company called Magpie Games.
3050894	3059020	So they have done a magpie game themed month this month in November, and they invited me to come play a game with them.
3059020	3064524	And so I came to play Masks, which is about angsty teenage superhero stuff.
3064524	3065744	It was a lot of fun.
3065744	3073130	So we did the first episode last week, and we did the second and final episode, because it wasn't, you know, we weren't going to make it a huge, like, months-long campaign.
3073130	3078874	We did the second and final episode today, and I have to say, kudos, kudos to Jazzy, our GM, DM.
3079554	3082076	She did such a good job.
3082076	3083177	It was just so good.
3083177	3085099	And all the other players did too, don't get me wrong.
3085099	3095768	Definitely, I felt like sometimes I was a little in over my head because I don't think of backstory and some of these other things as much as some of the more seasoned players do, but they were very accepting of me and my lack of knowledge.
3095768	3099151	And there were some things I was able to do with it that were like, oh, okay, this is fun.
3099151	3100292	So I had a really good time.
3100292	3100393	And
3101374	3104759	I enjoyed that it was something a little different as far as tabletop games go.
3104759	3106481	It wasn't just D&D.
3106481	3111969	Not that there's anything wrong with D&D, but I like these other like contemporary types of choices and things.
3111969	3113191	So yeah, it was a lot of fun.
3113191	3117277	So check it out over at A Tale of D20s here on Twitch.
3118217	3120639	I believe the archives are going up on YouTube.
3120639	3131926	I think the first session just went up on YouTube, so I will dig that up and post that in the chat, maybe over on our Discord actually for folks throughout the week over at vognetwork.com.
3131926	3135689	You can get all those links to cameo appearances and things like that.
3135689	3136449	So thank you.
3136449	3141733	Thank you so much to the folks at A Tale of D20s for having me on that because it's a lot of fun.
3141733	3143414	Okay.
3143414	3144775	Let's get into the news this week.
3146795	3148816	I don't even know what year it is anymore.
3148816	3154977	It is 2023 and sometimes, yeah, sometimes it still feels like 2020 February.
3154977	3158318	That's when I thought this thought it was dead.
3158318	3162679	It's just pulling its lifeless corpse out of the ground again.
3162679	3164699	The Amico's back.
3164699	3166320	Hurrah.
3166320	3166920	You know what?
3166920	3171521	I just want to say Amico has two eyes in it.
3171521	3174922	Zombie for the Wii U also has two eyes in it.
3176144	3179065	Zombeeko.
3179065	3181306	Hear me out here, Zombeeko.
3181306	3183447	Amiiko only has one eye in it.
3183447	3185288	I thought Amiiko had two eyes in it.
3185288	3186028	No.
3186028	3186508	Did I?
3186508	3188409	Oh, then I totally misspelled it.
3188409	3189630	Amiibo?
3189630	3190810	Never mind.
3190810	3193171	We're going to just forget this conversation ever happened.
3193171	3196973	I'm just going to use zero powers to erase everybody's mind.
3199045	3217429	Anyways, so apparently there was an update to the Amico fundraising page on Republic, which has been closed for two years now, I think, with little updates coming from the Intellivision team because they got nothing to show for themselves.
3217429	3220090	But now they have Amico Home.
3220090	3227632	Amico Home is a brand new app that you can get that is in beta right now.
3228392	3237357	And it is a way to, for households that already have a family tablet, Amico Home is an affordable way to enjoy family gaming entertainment.
3237357	3243340	We're delighted to invite you to join the family gaming revolution with Amico Home.
3243340	3247602	So, they have two games available on it right now.
3247602	3250603	Astro Smash and Missile Command.
3250603	3251604	Each of those are $15 each.
3254489	3261856	and from my understanding with this the way you have to play this and and correct me if i'm wrong here so
3262742	3271784	I believe one device, yes, so you cannot play this on, so if I have a phone, I cannot play this on my phone.
3271784	3274505	I have to have my phone and another phone.
3274505	3287508	So one phone acts as the console and streams to your TV, the other phone acts as the controller that I then have to connect to my first phone to play the games on, which
3288644	3291227	is stupid and on top of-
3307427	3308147	It literally is.
3308147	3308888	It literally is.
3308888	3310969	Assuming you have multiple phones.
3310969	3311729	Don't you all have phones?
3311729	3313269	Assuming you care about Android phones.
3335554	3351244	And then on top of that, like, well, at the very least, if you are one of the crazy folks that decided to purchase the physical copies of those games and you got your RFID chips or whatever, you will be able to use these to redeem those games in this app.
3351244	3353045	It's not your console.
3353045	3360710	The console is still available for pre-order, though, just so you know, and they are hopefully going to use some of this, the funds made from this to help.
3361497	3368567	I mean, yeah, I could strategize to become a billionaire, but that doesn't mean that's going to happen either.
3379229	3382550	That doesn't really mean anything.
3382550	3384710	And of course, what funds made from this?
3384710	3386430	This is this is going to bomb.
3386430	3387491	It's set up to fail.
3387491	3394832	And this isn't me shitting on Amico because Amico was something I I foolishly, I guess, bought into in the beginning.
3394832	3396672	You know, whatever you want to call it.
3396672	3399373	I did think there was some good ideas with this in the beginning.
3399373	3405694	And one of those good ideas was, by the way, that they weren't going to charge any more than eight dollars for a game.
3406499	3409646	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3415805	3417726	So that's one problem.
3417726	3426350	Um, the second problem is if this was supposed to be a family, this, this was hyped as the family friendly, you know, this is going to be the, the party machine.
3426350	3427871	You get people together.
3427871	3429492	You can all play in the same room.
3429492	3435075	This is what is, but the problem is now it's this whole, cause you have to have two devices to make it work.
3435075	3439237	So it's gotta, you know, the neck bones got to connect to the hip bone and the leg bone and all this.
3439237	3443159	If you want a family to play with you, you're going to need like three or more devices.
3443479	3443999	DarkSakura.
3467185	3472306	Well, and even still, this is this is set up for this is literally set up for failure.
3472306	3478547	And even still like, OK, Astro Smash and Missile Command, like.
3478547	3488129	That's not really a draw for me to play that on the Amico on a touch screen of a phone, by the way, like.
3488129	3491430	Could you I mean, Missile Command's in the Atari collection.
3495068	3496989	And the games look cheap already.
3496989	3499390	Like, just why even bother?
3499390	3501871	That Shark Shark game was terrible.
3501871	3502411	Well, right.
3502411	3511094	Well, after Smash and Missile Command, they have their product pages out on the Android storefront that you can check out.
3511094	3512555	And like, I mean, honestly,
3514239	3541854	all all their well it has okay so fun part is it has the the amico uh controller like it shows what their controller is and what the buttons do on that which okay cool except i don't have an amico controller because i have my phone um it just looks cheap it looks like a cheap web game that you can whip up in a few seconds and honestly you probably could like it's just not
3542987	3561218	it's not worth 15 bucks first off and secondly it's not worth it to put yourself through the hassle of you know connecting multiple devices up to play it like if they were smart what they would do is like hey let's put out some games i wouldn't charge
3563494	3586767	$15 for them, but like, hey, let's throw them into, you know, the Apple Arcade environment or the Play Store thing and just sell them as like actual games you can play on your Apple TV device or on... To be fair-ish, that Astro Smash is out on Switch, but that's because the company that partnered with Amico to do that basically owns the rights to everything Astro Smash now.
3586767	3591930	And I think that's them trying to recoup some of the money that they can see they're not going to get back.
3592150	3592510	Right.
3592510	3595411	So you can do that for what it's worth ish.
3595411	3596651	Excuse me.
3596651	3601752	So it's that was also stupid on their part.
3601752	3603633	Bobby is still up your licenses.
3603633	3609334	Bobby and Chad is pointing out, I think their idea is to sell the controller now if they can make them at any scale.
3609334	3610594	And that works with your phone.
3610594	3612435	It won't work, but that's their idea.
3612435	3616776	This I mean.
3616776	3620137	This this actual device was supposed to come out in 2019.
3622725	3624405	Yeah, the first, or was it 2020?
3624405	3627206	It was 10-10-20.
3627206	3627306	2020.
3627306	3628247	Was the first, right?
3628247	3632648	Because it had a whole little thing with the date.
3632648	3633148	It was 10-10-20.
3633148	3635609	It was supposed to be when this device was supposed to first come out.
3635609	3635949	Fine.
3635949	3637629	COVID happens and it delayed.
3637629	3641890	And then I guess I understand there was a bad business deal behind the scenes and all this stuff.
3641890	3643311	Yada, yada, yada, yada.
3643311	3650873	Here we are three years later and this thing is just a shell of what it was, basically.
3650873	3651753	So I just...
3653564	3656646	DJRamaS in chat says Tommy T took the money and ran.
3656646	3657926	Simpsons, Monorail, anyone?
3657926	3659467	What money?
3659467	3662109	What money?
3662109	3662729	I mean, the preorder.
3662729	3663429	There is no money.
3663429	3664510	The preorder money.
3664510	3671033	This is the chance to get the yeah, but that preorder money long since paid the staff at, you know, Intellivision that was working.
3671033	3679598	Yeah, I think they just waste of the money as like with unnecessary office things and the salaries for like a really high salaries for people that were doing nothing.
3680342	3680842	And in the end?
3700475	3708802	The people who spent the money on it just want something for their money or their money back, end of story, and not excuses.
3708802	3711024	And I happen to be one of those people.
3711024	3719431	And I, you know, this is an interesting lesson through the whole thing that's like, you know, well, you idiot, that's what you get for backing Kickstarters and that sort of thing.
3720572	3729416	It got to a point to where I was like, you know, even as horrible as everybody is saying this thing is, like, I actually kind of want one now at this point, because like, this could be the next 3DO.
3729416	3734819	Like, you know, or this this type of thing where it's like, this is gonna be a collector's item and it's badness type of way.
3734819	3747485	But now it's like, I've kind of just accepted the fact that like, here we are all these years later, and I'm just I'm, I'm not gonna ever have one of these like, it's just and you live, you learn.
3747485	3749006	I'll think I'll think harder next time.
3750222	3757863	I'll spend my hundred bucks on cheap little machines that I can show off in my studio.
3757863	3766265	I just, I don't get like, if you're, I don't, you wouldn't buy a, it just doesn't make any sense.
3766265	3768205	What is it trying?
3768205	3770466	I mean, at this point, like, it's just not trying to do anything.
3770466	3776787	It's just trying to like, they're just trying to make more money or make their money back or something like that off of a failed project.
3776787	3776967	But
3778567	3789213	I just don't understand what they're trying to do at this point, because it's not... You've already thrown out the window that, oh, only this Amico controller can do this, because obviously it can't.
3789213	3798057	And now, oh, only our console can do this, and it's not an Android device, except it is, literally.
3798057	3801379	I don't know.
3801379	3802740	You can only get these games here.
3802740	3802960	Nope.
3804566	3805187	What's the point?
3819867	3827910	that all these years later, Atari buys Intellivision and and to the rights to the you know, because again, Atari has been building up like this classic game thing.
3827910	3835792	And imagine if you could have Atari and Intellivision games on the same console, the ultimate 80s console bundle, basically, like it's it's all in one.
3835792	3836552	It's everything.
3836552	3843655	Except I believe some of the rights issues are going to get very interesting because I actually think they now can't put Astro Smash and some of those others on that.
3843655	3847276	But for what it's worth, they'll, you know, put real sports and some of that other stuff.
3848016	3852279	Uh, on those, I honestly think that's, that's where this goes.
3852279	3859544	I think, you know, I, I, and then Calico rises from the dead to claim them all.
3859544	3866749	So they're also launching something called Amico Club, a central location for managing your Amico gaming experience with all two games.
3866749	3873654	It says you'll also be able to create your own Amico Club account, taxes, unique content, special offers and features.
3873654	3875135	You have nothing to offer me.
3876889	3881291	How could I do that?
3881291	3883533	It'll offer... I love how this is.
3883533	3892397	Amico Home will allow hundreds of millions of people around the globe to turn their mobile devices into... Yeah, potentially they could use their mobile device to do that.
3892397	3893558	Potentially.
3893558	3902262	But no, no, that doesn't mean just because, oh, I was just waiting for my mobile device to support Amico.
3902262	3905024	And now that I can, the revolution's here, I guess.
3906844	3916138	Um, I was gonna say as well, uh, DarkTitsG and chat says, well, since Atari will have digital clips under their wing, maybe the inevitable in television collections will be good.
3916138	3916879	Ironically,
3917830	3924592	the game they had, uh, 2014, the Intellivision flashback that they had wasn't that bad.
3924592	3927912	It was actually pretty good for those, for those collections.
3927912	3929613	That was the last thing.
3929613	3931973	Um, oh man, I forget the guy's name.
3931973	3933294	He passed away.
3933294	3940615	And that's when Tommy came in after he, Dan was the former president of Intellivision.
3940615	3941796	And that was like the last thing.
3941796	3943036	Well, if he could see them now.
3944115	3952200	I don't want to get nasty, but it's just one of those things where it's like, yeah, that was one of the last things I remember that he was promoting was that Intellivision flashback.
3952200	3953721	And that was fine.
3953721	3955782	That was a good collection.
3955782	3960245	Keith Robinson, thank you, Bobby, was pushing.
3960245	3966368	So ironically, the last time Intellivision was good was exactly one of those collections that DarkSakura is talking about there.
3967569	3969750	I mean, according what could digital clips do?
3969750	3981015	And, you know, really, it would be fascinating if someday digital clips does this documentary, playable documentary of Intellivision start to finish.
3981015	3990919	Bill Adams, CEO of Intellivision, also says that the Intellivision plans to make a MECO game API for Unity available to third parties and developers.
3990919	3992279	Oh, goody.
3992279	3996261	I can learn how to develop for the Android device console.
3997335	3999959	What possible API can you have for Amico games?
3999959	4003564	Because it certainly doesn't look like they're doing anything special.
4003564	4004125	Whatever.
4004125	4007510	Some type of interfacing with the controller, I guess, is all I can think of.
4007510	4009573	I don't know.
4010868	4019275	Alright, anyway, let's move on and talk about some cancelled projects from Rockstar.
4019275	4030985	Because there was a former Rockstar developer who, actually Technical Director Obey Vermeej, I hope I said that right, spent 14 years at Rockstar North and then left in 2009.
4032626	4043532	and actually went on to share some alleged details on some abandoned Rockstar Games, including Agent, which you might remember was announced in 2009 at E3.
4043532	4054398	Yeah, so that was... So again, this guy left in 2009 and this guy wrote a post about it.
4054398	4056539	I'm not sure exactly where he made the post.
4056539	4058920	I'm trying to see if it was like the LinkedIn thing or what it was.
4061181	4065967	where he had originally shared it.
4065967	4066868	Oh, it was a blog.
4066868	4069471	It was a blog spot, basically.
4069471	4071754	So just literally, I didn't think people were still using that.
4071754	4072875	How about that?
4072875	4074357	That he posted all this to.
4074357	4080445	So he was talking about how they were going to split Rockstar North into two teams.
4080885	4085787	Half were going to work on GTA 4 at the time and the other half were going to work on Agent.
4085787	4091610	And it was codenamed Jimmy because it was a James Bond game and Jimmy is the Scottish version of James.
4091610	4093250	That's where that came from, right?
4093250	4095071	It was going to be set in the 70s.
4095071	4099913	So of course, now that the post has come down, all these details have been shared everywhere, right?
4099913	4102715	Now we know these, you know, just, it's not even that big of stuff.
4102715	4107137	It's just a little bit more insight, like what Agent was actually going to be and this whole thing.
4109229	4112371	But it was actually then pulled.
4112371	4113451	And why was it pulled?
4113451	4116913	Because an email came in from Rockstar North.
4116913	4122935	And in a quote, Vermeej said, Apparently, some of the OGs there are upset by my blog.
4122935	4128238	I genuinely didn't think anyone would mind me talking about 20-year-old games, but I was wrong.
4128238	4131940	Something about ruining the Rockstar mystique or something.
4133010	4139714	Anyway, this blog isn't important enough to me to piss off my former colleagues in Edinburgh, so I'm winding it down.
4139714	4143916	I'll maybe just leave a few articles with antidotes that don't affect anyone but me.
4143916	4150480	I would love for Rockstar to open up about development of the trilogy themselves, but it doesn't look like that's going to happen anytime soon.
4150480	4152581	Maybe I'll try again in a decade or two.
4153061	4157183	And it does kind of lead like, you know, again, how long ago were these games development?
4157183	4162105	Was anyone really getting hurt by finding out these details of a game that effectively was canceled?
4162105	4165627	What, 13 years, maybe 12, 11 years ago at this point?
4165627	4169229	Like, I think when we talk about preserving games,
4170129	4175613	There's certain elements of the process of making games that also ought to be preserved as well.
4175613	4177454	Like if the game was canceled, it was canceled.
4177454	4177694	Fine.
4177694	4181897	I'm not saying that we have to we want to play what was out there of Agent and that whole thing.
4181897	4183658	I mean, I think that would actually be very fascinating.
4183658	4189883	But why would these stories be suppressed for the Rockstar Mystique?
4189883	4195406	So is Rockstar the same company today that it was 13 years ago?
4195406	4198589	Because I would argue that might actually be a problem if it is.
4198589	4198909	Hmm.
4199463	4200183	No, they're not.
4200183	4206647	I mean, unless they were greedy, money hungry.
4206647	4209829	No, they weren't that bad back then.
4209829	4213531	They had some good expansion packs for the Grand Theft Auto 4 game.
4213531	4215772	That was a solid title.
4215772	4218914	All of the expansions, fantastic.
4218914	4222536	And then GTA 5 happened.
4222536	4222696	Yeah.
4222864	4228691	Well, what this whole thing tells me is that it's not about the mystique or whatever you want to call it with that.
4228691	4232956	It's that Rockstar wants to control the narrative on this information.
4232956	4235900	And they have that taken away from them in this blog post.
4235900	4237682	And that's what pissed them off.
4237682	4241987	They want control of the narrative on how the stories on these games are being told and so forth.
4242708	4247932	Hopefully this shows there is interest in that narrative being out there.
4247932	4256478	And I wish more game companies would be vulnerable enough to peel back that layer a little bit and talk a little more about cancelled games and why.
4256478	4260541	This would make an excellent talk at Game Developers Conference.
4261579	4263240	Maybe it's not for everybody.
4263240	4271643	This isn't the type of thing they're going to get on stage at the Game Awards and announce, let's talk about how we fucked Agent.
4271643	4279247	But maybe a game developers conference type of talk about a post-mortem on Agent and lessons we learned from that.
4279247	4283569	And then some of that gets out there and the people that are interested in that can look it up.
4283569	4287731	And we get to preserve a little bit about game industry and how things are made behind the scenes.
4287731	4289431	I think that would actually be very interesting.
4291432	4294374	But, you know, I don't think we're ever going to get there.
4294374	4295735	So, I mean, it's fine.
4295735	4298997	Up until now, I've completely forgot the agent was a thing.
4298997	4300378	So, yeah.
4300378	4303520	And perhaps and maybe that's also Rockstar's problem.
4303520	4306602	Rockstar also wants the narrative right now to be talking about what?
4306602	4307903	GTA 6.
4307903	4312166	Tigerclaw in chat says GTA 6 is a very highly anticipated game.
4312166	4313447	A lot riding on that.
4313447	4315308	It could be their biggest game ever.
4315308	4315628	Yes.
4315628	4318830	In fact, they finally announced last week what we're getting.
4318830	4320932	The announcement of the announcement came out, right?
4321172	4322213	and Kelly took it down and now it is.
4345083	4346824	But I guess I digress.
4346824	4353370	I guess maybe that's a reason why Rockstar didn't want this out there right now, is that they want all the articles to be about GTA 6.
4353370	4358093	We'll put the trailer out, and I guarantee you all the articles will be about GTA 6.
4358093	4366380	So the question is, is it going to be the Game Aw- Are they going to do it at the Game Awards, or is their plan to do it the day after?
4366380	4370163	Because if they did it the day after the Game Awards, you know why they'd do that, right?
4370163	4373406	To take that narrative away from literally everybody else in the room.
4377586	4380947	So if it's not at the Game Awards, it's going to be the day after the Game Awards.
4380947	4387348	By the way, speaking of the Game Awards, it's going to be tricky, but we are going to do a live stream here at VOG Network.
4387348	4394690	So if you're interested in watching the Game Awards, come join us here at Twitch TV, VOG Network.
4394690	4397190	We will be live streaming.
4397190	4400811	Bobby, myself, anybody else that wants to join, I'm sure there's room for you.
4402540	4412863	I'll be cutting it close as I have a work meeting that ends 15 minutes before the Game Awards go live, but I'll be here, so it'll be fun.
4412863	4415863	Yeah, I definitely want to watch it live if I can.
4415863	4418124	Yeah, there's going to be some good trailers this year and nothing else.
4418124	4421005	Okay, I feel a coughing fit coming on, so I'm going to go to the next story.
4421005	4421385	DarkSakura?
4426599	4437966	They told us that Charles Martinet would still be involved with Nintendo and he is actually going to be a special guest at Nintendo Live 2024.
4437966	4441688	It's going to be taking place on January 20th, 2024 through the 21st.
4443869	4447452	at the Tokyo Big Sight Exhibition Center.
4447452	4454576	He will be at the Mario Dojo, which is basically where everybody goes through and plays Mario games.
4454576	4464883	And for other events that are going to happen, there will be a Legend of Zelda orchestral concert and a Splatoon 3 concert.
4464883	4471928	And there's going to be one of the games at the demo is going to be Princess Peach Showtime.
4475498	4477940	Awesome.
4477940	4480682	It's nice to see that Charles Martinet is still working busy, right?
4480682	4482784	But that's the game I'm looking forward to.
4482784	4483985	Yeah.
4483985	4488888	That, um, the Showtime game, that's probably the other game I'm going to use my voucher on.
4488888	4495373	Uh, cause, uh, I was looking at what else you can use those vouchers on and since I bought another one and, uh, Princess Peach Showtime is one of them.
4495373	4498836	So I'll probably get that with a voucher.
4498836	4498936	Cool.
4499315	4501037	Look forward to it.
4501037	4503439	Alright, moving on.
4503439	4505041	Look forward to it.
4505041	4507223	Alright.
4507223	4517615	Sony is probably pretty unhappy that they were unable to squash an almost $8 billion lawsuit over the PlayStation Store prices.
4518455	4532301	This is basically saying that, you know, Sony gets away with charging a 3% commission on all PlayStation sales, rather than charging a smaller amount and passing the savings on to the consumers.
4532301	4539745	That would never happen, passing the savings on to the consumers, because you may remember, like, even in
4540726	4551894	like the physical retail space, there's still margins in there to the platform holders and to the companies that make the games.
4551894	4562962	The 30% margin that they charge on the storefront is so that, you know, the PlayStation Network is somewhat subsidized by those sales as well.
4562962	4566905	But, you know, there's still folks that are bringing
4567365	4570707	And the best you're going to get out of it is a free copy of Horizon Zero Dawn.
4595097	4598759	because it's going to be even less.
4598759	4609665	Yeah, I think it's a... I mean, I get it, walled garden and all that stuff and anti-consumer stuff, but once again, I don't think there's anyone really been successful with making that argument on a console.
4611178	4624653	You know, phones are a little bit different in the sense that you can sideload stuff and there are multiple marketplaces sometimes, but on a console they don't really have third-party shops available for you to get software.
4624653	4631000	It'd be kind of weird if they did, but yeah, it's... I don't know.
4631000	4632862	I think they have to show...
4634577	4637898	DarkSakura, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4662789	4663995	One to keep an eye on for sure.
4666058	4674400	Alright, you'll have to excuse me, I have a case of the hiccups coming on, which is the worst thing that can happen when you're live on air, so please bear with me here while I get through the story.
4674400	4677880	And then after this, I'm going to run downstairs and get some water.
4677880	4679781	So let me get through this real quick.
4679781	4686602	Apparently, there was a guest character that was considered in Mortal Kombat 1 that didn't end up making the cut.
4686602	4692703	Ed Boon was mentioning on Twitter that Omni-Man was actually not the first character
4693263	4696166	to be approached to go into the game.
4696166	4716983	In a tweet, Ed Boon wrote, coincidentally, before we eventually went with Omni-Man, the first meeting I had with Robert Kirkman was to talk about the possibility of, and I hope I've never seen an episode of this show, so I hope I say the name right, Michonne, from The Walking Dead, Michonne, being a guest fighter in Mortal Kombat.
4719096	4726898	Michonne of course from The Walking Dead and so she would have been an interesting choice because everybody else has like supernatural powers.
4726898	4731179	I'm not sure that really exists in The Walking Dead at least from the survivors.
4731179	4736441	So there's no details as to why Omni-Man was ultimately picked over Michonne but probably
4737657	4744041	The fact that Invincible Season 2 was coming out, maybe it didn't make as much sense, I don't know.
4744041	4749405	But anything can happen in the future, but it's very interesting that that was even on the table.
4749405	4752507	And D'Artesia points out, honestly, that would have been badass.
4752507	4759811	Yeah, I mean, I don't know a lot about The Walking Dead, so it's hard for me to say, but it's interesting.
4759811	4760572	So, yeah.
4762873	4771200	All right, I need to step away for a minute, so I'm going to move on to our next story, DarkSakura.
4771200	4780827	So there is a Switch Online expansion pack that is adding some Nintendo 64 games.
4780827	4785771	One of them, though, is going to be just, sorry, it's going to be in Japan.
4785771	4789394	There is Goldeneye finally coming out in Japan.
4790314	4799302	and also Jet Force Gemini that's going to be available on November 30th, 2023.
4799302	4805307	Also, it's going to bring about an 18 plus version of Switch online Nintendo 64 app.
4807068	4816134	because in Japan, Goldeneye is rated Cero Z or Zed, which is a restricted access in Japan.
4816134	4821137	So, um, that's going to be the first one published by Nintendo.
4821137	4828301	Um, nothing yet for what North America and Europe will have, but hey, look forward to it.
4828301	4830743	Dot, dot, dot.
4830743	4834325	But yeah, there you go, Japan.
4837467	4852332	Uh, so, unfortunately, um, some folks playing Assassin's Creed games over the holiday, uh, had some wonderful advertisements thrown in their face as they're playing the game and were none too happy about that.
4852932	4862135	There was a Black Friday advertisement for Assassin's Creed Mirage that was basically popping up in the middle of some of the older games' titles.
4862135	4873819	There was a video taken on Reddit, for example, that had it popping up in, I don't remember, I think this may have been Odyssey.
4873819	4880501	And there's even older games that had that as well apparently popping up.
4880501	4880721	Now,
4882443	4891149	Of course, Ubisoft explained it away as it was a technical error that has now been fixed.
4891149	4905179	So basically, instead of popping up when they were bringing up the map, it was supposed to only display the promotion for the Assassin's Creed Mirage as part of the franchise news in the main menu of other Assassin's Creed games.
4906139	4914221	Unfortunately, they said a technical error caused the promotion to appear in one of our game's in-game menus.
4914221	4920203	That's a weird error to add features to a game, like in the form of advertisements.
4920203	4924184	Like, I don't think it's just easy to just, whoop, and it just, like, displays an image here.
4924184	4932026	You would think that that would just be part of, like, especially if we're talking, like, a news section of a game, you would be adding content to that.
4933536	4946521	I would see, I can't imagine that that would be easy to just accidentally put it in the wrong spot in multiple games across your history of games.
4946521	4951863	Bons006 in chat says, it was a test to see how the player base would take it, probably.
4951863	4953304	Exactly.
4953304	4961867	And to be honest, like... Sorry, quickly, DarkSakura says, so it's not enough to be $70, have a season pass and microtransactions.
4961867	4963028	Now they want to put ads in there?
4964693	4984188	Exactly, and here's the thing too about that is it's popping up when opening the map in the game and they said that also this technical error was in Assassin's Creed Odyssey four years ago as well and also would appear when opening up the map so
4986115	4988957	It's not a new thing.
4988957	4998141	It is a thing that they're trying to push by people to see if, oh, what kind of backlash are we going to get from it this time, you know?
4998141	5001183	It's sickening, is what it is.
5001183	5002704	Madden does the same thing.
5003379	5023565	your video made it this far in the show before it finally froze um again oh gosh i don't know why i don't know um anyway um yeah you know i'm reminded of something that happened this week by the way um is that my since you know i've been talking a lot about the arcade uh one-up cabinets a lot this week tron got a firmware update this last week
5024405	5032192	And when I went to turn it on again later, it came up with a splash screen that said Black Friday sales now live.
5032192	5034734	And I was like, Oh, give me a break.
5034734	5037197	Yeah, that's ridiculous to any of those things.
5037967	5039908	Like, you did a firmware update to deliver apps.
5060433	5066158	If you're tuned in enough, if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed or all this stuff, they have your email.
5066158	5069221	They have the cookies on your computer that tells them that you're a fan.
5069221	5070862	There's other ways to clue you in.
5070862	5072784	You don't need to throw an ad.
5072784	5075206	Do you not have to sign up?
5075206	5081491	All of these Assassin's Creed games have these stupid Ubisoft launcher that you have to use to get to them.
5081491	5083312	Can you not put the advertisement there?
5084093	5087235	is part of the launcher that you force everybody to use anyways?
5087235	5089896	Why does it have to pop up in the middle of a game?
5089896	5090716	It doesn't.
5090716	5092317	It doesn't have to do that.
5092317	5096119	So it is bullshit that you're saying, oh, it's a technical error.
5096119	5098280	Fuck you, Ubisoft.
5098280	5103362	You're fucking not paying attention to all the sexual misconduct and stuff going on in your company.
5103362	5105283	I'm sure that's a technical error, too.
5105283	5106944	Like, fucking hell, man.
5106944	5110005	Get with it.
5110005	5113227	At least they pulled their ads from Twitter this week, so they did one good thing.
5114146	5115067	Oh, okay.
5115067	5119531	Well, I know a broken clock is right twice a day, etc, etc.
5119531	5120692	All right.
5120692	5120732	Um,
5122054	5126998	Let's talk about Killer Instinct and that game still continues to go on.
5126998	5130842	It's a revived version of course that originally came out in 2013.
5130842	5134305	A new $30 anniversary edition is on its way out.
5134305	5139970	It's going to have all of the fighters and all of the premium content that is available.
5139970	5143613	Killer Instinct of course debuted as an Xbox One exclusive but
5144574	5146837	This version is going to be going free-to-play.
5146837	5152022	Now, funny enough, I thought Killer Instinct was already free-to-play for a certain amount of time, but I think it was one set of characters.
5152022	5153624	Yeah, because they had seasons they had to pay for, right?
5153624	5162954	Yeah, they had seasons and stuff, but now in this one, you're going to have one free weekly rotating fighter and access to single-player, local, and ranked modes.
5163911	5168753	And you can get this on Series X, Xbox One, and PC.
5168753	5177878	And now in the Anniversary Edition, you get all 29 fighters, all premium content, an XP booster, holiday accessories, and so forth.
5177878	5183481	This is going to replace the Definitive Edition that's out on Xbox consoles and PC.
5184802	5193649	Also interesting with this is that if you already had Killer Instinct on Steam, you get a free upgrade to the Anniversary Edition.
5193649	5195191	So that's kind of nice.
5195191	5198674	As part of that, you will no longer get to buy individual fighters.
5198674	5203898	If you want the whole roster, you buy the Anniversary Edition, or if you have Game Pass,
5205185	5206026	Thank you for watching!
5223114	5236160	pretty cool I guess for those that maybe have missed the game to this point sorry y'all I still have the hiccups it's not great so I am going to go back to a time when I didn't have the hiccups and take a trip down memory lane in our next segment
5246832	5254601	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5254601	5260347	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5260347	5262469	OK, and a little bit of the audio crept through there.
5262469	5262729	Sorry.
5262729	5266874	But what is the classic game, DarkSakura?
5266874	5267935	It is Renegade.
5270206	5281454	Well, to be technical, I actually picked Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun, which is the first game in the Kunio-kun series.
5281454	5283536	So, we're starting there.
5283536	5287299	I almost did Crash and the Boys just so I could say, is the drummer a boy too?
5289722	5297750	It translates to Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio.
5297750	5307200	It is a beat-em-up that was done by Technos Japan, distributed by Taito and Arcade in 1986.
5307200	5308442	And again, I'm going to the original.
5309210	5322913	It revolves around a high school delinquent named Kunio, or Kunio-kun, who has to go against rival gangs that are targeting his classmate, Hiroshi.
5322913	5330695	In the western version, Renegade, you're a street brawler who has to face against four different gangs to rescue your girlfriend from a mob boss.
5332255	5354400	But one of the interesting things about this, and it's something not everyone knows about the Kunio series, is that the creator, Kushimoto Yoshihisa, said the game was based on his own high school years by getting into fights, and Kunio is based partly on him.
5355240	5362922	Also drew inspiration from Enter the Dragon with the just knock down, drag out fights.
5362922	5370783	And then Technos actually altered the graphics for the U.S.
5370783	5374344	to change things to match the Warriors from 1979 just a little bit more.
5378065	5396750	Um, so this one is referred to as the belt scroll where you can go horizontally and vertically in a scrolling arena instead of just, you know, the left to right side scrolling.
5398250	5409312	It has combo attacks, a three-button control scheme, and this was the basis for Kishimoto's next game, Double Dragon.
5409312	5411533	Sound familiar?
5411533	5419114	The game also has had a bunch of ports, but the big thing about it is that it was the first in the Kunio-kun series.
5419114	5420975	And Kunio's done a lot of stuff.
5423015	5428139	You know, dodgeball to the Olympics and all kinds of stuff.
5428139	5441769	So there's also sequels that came out by, well, I should say more like spinoff series that was done by a British company, Ocean Software, for home computers.
5441769	5445592	That was Target Renegade in 1988 and Renegade 3, the final chapter, in 89.
5448074	5463128	Also, the game is presented from an isometric perspective, so you sort of look like you're in three-quarter perspective, and you have just a big range of using your environment.
5469267	5478512	In the NES version he's referred to as Mr. K and then Renegade in the manual for the US one.
5481235	5483716	Like I said, there were significant changes.
5483716	5487877	Of course, I linked the Kunio-kun one.
5487877	5497040	So, the stages in this game, there are a series of three screen-wide areas.
5497040	5500521	Like I said, the scrolling is that belt scrolling instead.
5500521	5505543	And so, you fight the underlings, and then the boss comes out and joins in on the fight.
5506483	5515173	And then when he is defeated, any of the remaining underlings will retreat to the bottom of the stage and the stage ends.
5515173	5520639	And of course, every boss character has their own, you know, energy bar and whatnot.
5523187	5525430	So, a little bit more about Kushimoto.
5525430	5532557	Before this, he worked at Data East and actually created some Laserdisc games.
5532557	5535100	You might find some of these familiar as well.
5535100	5537422	There was Cobra Command and Road Blaster.
5539121	5546187	And then Technos Japan basically wanted him to come in and work on Laserdisc games.
5546187	5557695	But instead, Kishimoto promoted his idea for a game that did not require Laserdiscs and presented basically his Kunio game.
5557695	5562819	And basically, they were like, OK, cool, you work here now.
5562819	5566241	So at any rate,
5567702	5585308	The big thing with this game, and you might even notice that if you've even gone in and played the downtown story, which we got as River City Ransom, that if you've played the originals of them, they are, well, incredibly Japanese.
5588843	5607271	In this game, you have your Bosozoku members, you have a Skeban with her minions, you have Yakuza-type members, and you start off at a train station and all kinds of stuff.
5607271	5609972	And it didn't have a Damsel in Distress plot.
5609972	5613854	It was just basically Kunio standing up for his buddy.
5613854	5614634	I mean, that was it.
5615254	5617556	Which is cool.
5617556	5629608	And, I mean, when the game ends, you know, the kids of Niketsu High School greet Kunio, and his friend Hiroshi comes up and gives him a handshake, and then you start a new cycle.
5632330	5637972	It's a little bit more, you know, just kind of boring, I think, for the U.S.
5637972	5639832	version.
5639832	5650876	But, of course, this came out on Famicom and was such a big hit that this spawned more games.
5650876	5657478	So, the next one after that was Neketsu Koko Dodge Babu, which was Super Dodgeball.
5658598	5669081	released in the arcade and Famicom, and then we had, you know, River City Ransom, aka Downtown Neketsu Monogatari.
5669081	5675402	We had Neketsu Coco Dodgeball Boo Soccer Hen, which was Nintendo World Cup.
5675402	5682624	We had Bikkuri Neketsu Shin Kiroku, which was Crash and the Boys Street Challenge.
5682624	5686705	But the majority of the Kunio games just came out in Japan.
5687425	5696094	As far as ports go, there was the Famicom version that was released in-house by Technos and released in 1987 by Taito in North America.
5702500	5706002	Motorcycle chase in the game is pretty intense.
5706002	5717831	There was the Sega Master System version, which I've got, that was developed by Natsume and released by Sega in 1993, based largely off the NES port rather than the original.
5717831	5719432	This is for Renegade.
5719432	5724055	But had enhanced graphics and several improvements, had new death cut scenes, a revamped ending,
5724515	5730118	and I do believe this is also one that took advantage of the FM sound.
5730118	5741465	For other home versions, there was the Amiga, Apple II, IBM PC, the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, and Commodore 64 in Europe.
5741465	5745367	American computer ports were done by Software Creations and published by Taito.
5746988	5752392	where the European one were by Ocean Software on their Imagine label.
5752392	5759436	It was an Apple 2GS port that was also developed by Taito in 1988.
5759436	5764039	But while there were screenshots of it shown, the game was never released.
5764039	5769842	Commodore 64 version was programmed by Ocean Stephen... I'm going to mispronounce this... Waheed.
5772475	5791048	But going back though to the game itself and its receptions, the Arcade Cabinet was the top grossing title on game machines charts in July 1986, and the 5th highest grossing table arcade game
5793730	5795472	during the later half of 1986.
5795472	5813026	The ZX Spectrum version in the UK was the top selling computer game on all formats charts in September 1987 and topped the ZX Spectrum charts in September and October 1997 and number 3 after that.
5813026	5817010	Basically, the game was pretty well received.
5818763	5830327	As far as the NES port for Renegade, it was released on the Wii's Virtual Console North America in 2008 and re-released on 3DS Virtual Console and Wii U Virtual Console.
5830327	5838169	And there's a Switch one out that came out in June 2018 by Hamster for their Arcade Archive series.
5838169	5847312	It has both the US and also has the distinction of being the first time the original Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun was released
5847832	5850494	in the US.
5850494	5856419	But it was also considered to be the first fully developed beat-em-up game.
5856419	5861563	It improvised on the side-scrolling genre.
5861563	5864846	It pretty much set the standard.
5864846	5866787	It was THE game.
5866787	5874193	And then of course, like I said, Kishimoto later on came out with Double Dragon after that as a spiritual successor.
5876354	5895458	And then, of course, you know how many more games we have like that, but there was also, I mean, there were Game Boy versions that, for example, there was one that was called The Renegades, but was retooled as Double Dragon 2 by Acclaim, and published by Acclaim.
5895458	5899619	That one was originally Neketsu ko Hakugyokutun Bangai Rantouhen.
5901601	5908471	And then of course Technos did a lot more of them, you know, there was a Super Dodgeball, River City Ransom, blah blah blah.
5908471	5913158	And there is also in the manga Ichigo 100%, there is a
5917003	5922447	character named Kunio, you know, named after, after the games, but there we go.
5922447	5933215	And just also as an FYI, the, um, the Kunio-kun series now is, uh, I'm trying to see who owns it now.
5933215	5944082	Um, because it might still be, uh, cause I thought that now it was owned by someone other than Taito, but I could be wrong.
5944082	5946424	Um, but at any rate, there you go.
5948032	5950015	It's Kunio-kun.
5960782	5964144	Well, we don't- But aren't they all?
5964144	5970129	Well, sometimes, admittedly, you pick a bad one, but no, that was- But it's notable.
5970129	5973791	It's kind of, yeah, it's one of those games where we're kind of like, oh, I guess, I guess we haven't covered that one.
5973791	5975152	You know, again, here we are.
5975152	5975352	What?
5975352	5977534	How many episodes- It was Arc System Works.
5977534	5978114	That's right.
5978114	5979775	Yeah.
5979775	5981076	So, all right.
5981076	5983318	I knew it was some big name and my brain blanked on it.
5983706	5986470	Good news is, during that segment, I appear to have lost my hiccups.
5986470	5988753	Hooray, because that was very annoying.
5988753	5990275	We do have just a couple other stories.
5990275	5990956	We don't have a lot.
5990956	5998247	I mean, honestly, the news is very light this week, but I think Loki just has a couple other little quick hits here in our abbreviated rapid fire news tonight.
5999178	6016069	Yeah, so part of Half-Life, the 25th Anniversary Edition update, they've actually gone in and fixed an animation error that was part of the Blast Pit chapter of the game where a scientist gets dragged off by tentacles.
6016069	6020052	It kind of looked janky before, kind of floated in the air.
6020052	6025396	Now it's fixed after 10 years or more.
6025396	6026056	So that's cool.
6028940	6036021	On the front of more things that can play Doom, apparently earrings now can play Doom.
6036021	6047583	There was a, it looks like it's like a little earring that is shaped like a Game Boy that you can apparently play games on for whatever reason.
6047583	6051564	It's a gaming device called Tiny Circuits.
6051564	6056525	And it has like a key chain, or I guess in this case, you could use it as an earring.
6058592	6060153	Apparently you can put Doom on it now.
6060153	6069537	I can't imagine the controls very well considering it has, you know, a D-pad and two buttons, but it wasn't about whether it was good.
6069537	6070798	It was about whether you could do it.
6070798	6072279	So now you can do it.
6072279	6077141	If you could put Doom on a refrigerator, a toaster, then why not?
6077141	6078562	Why not a pair of earrings?
6078562	6080283	Why not?
6080283	6080463	Yeah.
6082318	6087419	Just because we could doesn't mean we should have stopped and asked if we should or whatever that quote was from Jurassic Park.
6087419	6089920	We must because we can.
6089920	6093801	Anyway, Fifth Dream points out maybe you can use a Bluetooth controller.
6093801	6094521	Who knows?
6094521	6095902	Anything's possible.
6095902	6098822	Or a second phone.
6098822	6099923	Oh, fuck off.
6099923	6101103	All right.
6101103	6105464	Let's travel around the world and see if there's anything coming out this week.
6105464	6106645	Loki, let's start with you.

6414980	6415320	Who's this?
6416772	6417974	AJ Twist is here with us today!
6428840	6434243	It was good, except I had barbecue instead of turkey, but I had Georgian food, which is essentially like barbecue.
6434243	6435223	And it was awesome.
6435223	6435784	Yeah.
6435784	6438385	So I don't I don't know why it has to be turkey on Thanksgiving.
6438385	6438905	I'll eat what I want.
6438905	6440106	I had lasagna.
6440106	6441126	Oh, that's great.
6441126	6441847	OK, Garfield.
6441847	6443628	I'm just kidding.
6443628	6444008	That's funny.
6444008	6446629	I'm a big Garfield fan.
6446629	6449691	Oh, what do you think about Chris Pratt doing that voice, too?
6450131	6451733	Oh, I know, right?
6451733	6452473	You know what?
6452473	6454055	I saw the trailer.
6454055	6455056	I'm OK with it.
6455056	6456097	Me sounds all right.
6456097	6458919	Yeah, that's that's how the Mario movie worked out, too.
6458919	6460201	We just all had to make it.
6460201	6466787	I don't get why everyone's mad at Chris Pratt for doing voice acting like he's been good in all the stuff that he's done voice acting for.
6466787	6467267	Like, I don't know.
6467267	6469069	I think it's just the fact that it's Chris Pratt.
6469069	6470090	He's just taking all the good parts.
6470090	6471231	He gives someone else a turn.
6471231	6472532	Well, then blame the directors.
6472532	6473353	He's very problematic.
6475296	6475556	All right.
6475556	6476217	I don't know.
6476217	6479279	I'm sure AJ Twist did not call in to talk about Chris Pratt tonight.
6479279	6481661	So no, I don't mind it.
6481661	6483222	What's on your mind tonight?
6483222	6484743	A couple of things.
6484743	6491608	First off, I want to like kind of recap Evo 2023, which I, you know, did August.
6491608	6492909	How was that?
6492909	6494170	It was great.
6494170	6494871	It was awesome.
6494871	6497032	They had their big arcade set up.
6497032	6499914	This is the one thing I want to talk about that I had the best time right here.
6499914	6504758	I went to the free arcade like on a Saturday and I found Puzzle Bobble.
6505356	6507218	Love Puzzle Bubble.
6507218	6511683	And I wanted to play because I never get to really play other people, like playing versus mode.
6511683	6513045	So I found it.
6513045	6513986	Some guy was sitting there.
6513986	6514606	I was playing him.
6514606	6515347	He was really good.
6515347	6518431	And it turns out he actually owns an arcade himself.
6518431	6521634	So he plays it often, which explains why he was so good kicking my ass that day.
6522395	6525218	But then when he left, three other guys came through.
6525218	6529022	I don't know where they were from, but they're just all like, you know, best friends, all hype.
6529022	6531965	And they're like, oh, we're going to play just, you know, one by one.
6531965	6534168	And we just went in a circle playing each other.
6534168	6534588	It was awesome.
6534588	6536971	It was a great time playing them for a few hours.
6536971	6539714	And then someone else came through, this one girl.
6540314	6541996	And when she came over, I recognized her.
6541996	6543256	I was like, you look familiar.
6543256	6546639	I was like, wait, I think I follow you on Instagram, which I did.
6546639	6550822	And so I got to meet this Instagram person I've been following on Instagram forever.
6550822	6552304	So that was kind of cool.
6552304	6557047	And she ended up being like the best Bust-a-Move Puzzle Bubble player like we ever seen.
6557047	6558849	She was kicking all our asses.
6558849	6560750	And it was, I don't know, it was a great time.
6560750	6562532	Eventually, I ended up beating her though, which was awesome.
6563652	6567257	And then someone else came over and started kicking everyone else's asses.
6567257	6569860	And it turns out he also owned the machine.
6569860	6571743	And he was friends with the girl.
6571743	6574707	And that's why she was so good, because she goes to his house to play the machine.
6574707	6578572	So I was like, oh, wow, I need to get my own arcade machine, I think.
6578572	6581316	Careful, building your own arcade at home is an addicting hobby.
6584022	6590366	But just that moment at Evo, just playing Puzzle Bobble with a bunch of random people from who knows where.
6590366	6593707	That was just like one of the greatest moments I've had at Evo by far.
6593707	6594988	No, that's so perfect.
6594988	6597049	You know, that's the best part of conventions.
6597049	6603632	It doesn't necessarily have to be that panel or that show or that, you know, piece of programming that really got you.
6603632	6610676	But it's like when you just have that moment where you're just connecting with other nerds and like doing that thing, you just like enjoy, especially when it's a niche thing.
6610676	6610956	Right.
6610956	6612117	So a game like Puzzle Bobble
6613357	6614219	Thank you for watching!
6629033	6633317	At EVO, though, I didn't do too well entering tournaments that I've actually, you know, went there to enter.
6633317	6639702	I entered for Street Fighter VI, for Tekken 7, and also Soul Calibur VI.
6639702	6640322	Oh, wow.
6640322	6644966	And I got my ass handed to me all throughout, didn't win any matches.
6644966	6655375	But I blame the reason why I didn't do so good, because I wasn't really practicing those games too much months before, because I was too busy building myself an arcade stick.
6656627	6661897	And this is something that I've done for years now and I have a 3D printer.
6661897	6664762	My friends have been telling me for years to like 3D print an arcade stick.
6664762	6666565	But when I first got it, I was like, I'm not there yet.
6666565	6667066	I'm not there yet.
6667066	6667948	Let me play with it some more.
6668516	6670819	And finally this year, I was like, I think I'm ready.
6670819	6674484	So I went ahead and built an arcade stick and I used that.
6674484	6678990	And this is the other highlight for me too, was that like people actually like, you know, turned around like, hey, can I see your arcade stick?
6678990	6683235	And I was even interviewed by somebody who has a YouTube channel.
6683235	6685939	So I popped up on their YouTube channel talking about my arcade stick.
6686980	6691984	And then I took it to this one spot at Evo called the Arcade Stick Museum.
6691984	6696428	And then the people that were there running it, I showed them my stick to see if they were just interested.
6696428	6699090	I wanted to see if I was doing something cool or not.
6699090	6702112	And they saw it and they all like kind of flipped out like, well, it's amazing.
6702112	6703413	Ask me questions.
6703413	6706035	Some guy was offering to buy it off me.
6706035	6706636	Stuff like that.
6706636	6706956	Wow.
6707720	6714266	Um, and then this kind of leads into a story you guys had, uh, that came up, I think about a week or two ago about, uh, how Xbox.
6714266	6714627	Yeah.
6714627	6717569	I was just about to ask, does this Microsoft thing affect you?
6717569	6717890	Okay.
6717890	6718150	Okay.
6718150	6718330	Yeah.
6718330	6718951	Yeah.
6718951	6721914	That I don't, I don't use Xbox anymore.
6721914	6723095	I'm just PC now.
6723095	6726918	Um, when I play with friends, they all own PlayStations, so we're good there.
6726918	6732644	But if I did own an Xbox, I would be so upset because I use a brook board to build my arcade sticks.
6734161	6742124	And then also that whole thing with having some type of disability, I guess I kind of do now.
6742124	6744805	I guess I'm developing carpal tunnel or something like that.
6744805	6747006	This is an issue I've kind of had for a while now.
6747006	6752288	So the arcade stick that I built actually, the reason why it was so unique is because it actually splits open.
6752288	6753368	It cuts in half.
6753368	6758250	So my joystick part and my buttons part kind of split apart to where they're about a foot apart from each other.
6758630	6767592	As opposed to like a traditional arcade setup where like your lever and your buttons are like just inches away from each other So it's a like a split keyboard pretty much.
6767592	6780635	Yeah, exactly It's on rails so it can actually open up and close up so it can Go down to compact size like a normal arcade stick and when I'm playing it, I just pull it open like a drawer It is on rails like a drawer actually it's drawer rails that I built it over but
6781815	6783035	That's what makes it unique.
6783035	6786697	And I had to build that for myself because there wasn't anyone making arcade sticks like that.
6786697	6789917	So that's one reason why I wanted to build my own arcade stick.
6789917	6791558	Also because I just like building stuff.
6791558	6793819	But eventually there was a reason for it.
6793819	6799300	And then with Microsoft, like disabling these brook boards, I'm not sure if they went back on it yet or not.
6799300	6800701	I haven't looked into that.
6800701	6802301	I was just about to see it.
6802301	6804182	Did Microsoft reverse course on that?
6804182	6805902	We never really got a follow up on that.
6805902	6806583	So I'm going to ask.
6806583	6807803	I'm going to ask Chad to
6808584	6810025	Do some investigative work for me.
6810025	6824564	There's not a way to spoof that, Kenny, because I remember back in the day when I used to have a keyboard mouse device for the Xbox 360, I think you had to have a controller plugged into it.
6825299	6839393	And then it basically spoofed the ID for the controller to make it look like an authentic controller with that, but didn't pass through the functionality through... I mean, I guess you could just do that anyways, just wire it up to an actual controller.
6839393	6844177	It's just a pain in the butt to have to solder to those boards, traces.
6844838	6855646	That's the classic way people would make sticks back in the day was, you know, break open an actual, you know, first party device and just solder pieces and wires to it and then connect it to your own buttons.
6855646	6857608	I mean, people still do that sometimes.
6857608	6859389	Probably going to have to go back to it now.
6859389	6860830	Yeah, exactly.
6860830	6863072	But Brickboards made it easy because they were just compatible.
6863072	6864233	Just plug and play right there.
6864233	6866534	You just, you know, wired up your own buttons to it.
6866534	6867155	They're really cool.
6867675	6876280	Um, and there's different versions that exist, you know, some only work for Xboxes, some only work for PlayStation, the more expensive one can work for all of them.
6876280	6878542	Uh, there's different type of boards you can get.
6878542	6883264	Um, so that makes it cool and unique right there, but they blocked it now.
6883264	6894251	Uh, I guess the only other way they can maybe get around that is Brooke going, you know, through whatever hoops they have to go through to get it, you know, actually licensed and recognized by Microsoft would be the only legit way I can see.
6895185	6899627	But other than that, yeah, they're kind of killing off their fighting game section.
6899627	6905389	If Xbox has thought about it for a little bit, they're kind of blocking us from all that.
6905389	6912692	So I've been trying to quickly, like while you've been talking, try to figure out if we have had an update on this whole type of scenario.
6912692	6920175	So apparently, and this is where we should have assumed this was all going to go, modders are already bypassing.
6920535	6925077	this particular thing with their own workaround.
6925077	6943283	So even though back in October we saw the error message start to come up that was going to block that out, apparently from a post that went up on Twitter, this user, Robert Dale Smith is the name, actually was showing using an official controller as some sort of like bypass.
6943283	6943943	I'm trying to see.
6943943	6944483	Yeah, same.
6944483	6945784	Told you that's how they used to do it.
6945784	6946204	Yeah.
6946204	6948725	Is that now they're hooking up a PlayStation controller
6949025	6952529	And there they go, they're actually using a Playstation controller on their Xbox through this workaround that they're using.
6964955	6969821	Even though it's modders, the old adage hacker's going to hack still applies.
6969821	6971624	Yeah, well, it's just how they used to do it before.
6971624	6979173	I mean, so if it worked like that before, assuming that they haven't made it more sophisticated than, you know, it's the way they're going to do it again.
6979173	6979814	So, yeah, it makes sense.
6981051	6983833	Hackers will find a way.
6983833	6987755	They don't ask if they should or shouldn't or whatever that quote was we just said moments ago.
6987755	6989536	Yes, yes.
6989536	6992217	They do what they must because they can.
6992217	6992797	But that's cool.
6992797	6995959	But yeah, hopefully, I know Xbox and Brooke can find something.
6995959	7004964	So I don't know, at least they could do that because, you know, like people because first off, they also have their disability controller thing, which I hear is hard to find too.
7005724	7017752	So, anyone that has some type of disability where they need something or they can't use an actual controller, like, you know, make their disability controller more available or just fix this so we can just do our own things with these.
7017752	7019593	You know, like, they're not hacking devices either.
7019593	7032001	Actually, another thing too I wanted to bring up with those Brookboards is that as far as, like, tournament play goes, the Brookboards have firmware updates that you can do to kind of go along with whatever big tournament you're about to join.
7032721	7036442	For example, one thing people play with is hitboxes.
7036442	7038002	Hitboxes is where you don't have a lever.
7038002	7041943	It's a leverless arcade stick, basically, where you don't have an actual joystick.
7041943	7046685	You have, like, four buttons for your up, down, left, right, and all that.
7046685	7051646	But they have it in a different format, though, where it's not like your traditional, like, keyboard up, down, left, right.
7051646	7056467	You have your thumb would be your up, and your left, down, and right.
7057054	7057274	right
7072782	7088884	that people find out over time is that you can kind of cheat charge characters like for example Guile doing a sonic boom like you can hold back easily and easily hit a forward button real quick and hold back really quick again so you can get a lot of sonic booms out a lot quicker than you would like a traditional joystick
7089544	7092665	And so tournament players were like, wait, we should do something about this.
7092665	7103967	And so they figured out something and they made a former update pretty much saying that if anyone holds both forward and back at the exact same moment, it no longer counts as a direction of any sort.
7103967	7105468	It just counts as neutral.
7105468	7109909	So that makes it a little more difficult to pull off those sonic booms or charge moves like that.
7110549	7135818	still doable but like just a little more difficult not so like lazy I guess so but like there's things that go into it that makes it still usable where it's not like cheating and again you know if Microsoft maybe did some research and understood that or maybe they should do that maybe they will understand that and if there's any type of weird mechanics that they don't want to happen then you know let Brook know and maybe they can add a patch to it and then all those controllers will you know work as they like
7136377	7141538	I'd be curious, you talked about your custom controller a lot and how the reception was.
7141538	7142739	Do you have a picture of it somewhere?
7142739	7146940	I mean, I know it's a podcast, but I'd still be curious to see a picture of it.
7146940	7149660	How do I do video?
7149660	7150581	Is this video?
7150581	7151201	Turn on camera?
7151201	7152041	Can I do that?
7152041	7152701	Yeah, you can.
7152701	7153661	You can share video.
7153661	7156062	We have a shot that we can, if you're willing to share.
7156062	7156542	There you are.
7156542	7161643	Hey, how's it going?
7161643	7163424	This is my arcade stick.
7163424	7163804	Oh, wow.
7164907	7170230	It's mostly 3D printed all the way around, except the acrylic on the on the front and on the on the bottom.
7170230	7173913	That's all acrylic that I got sent in to to get cut.
7173913	7176054	And then the split open looks.
7176054	7176854	Wow.
7176854	7177355	OK.
7177355	7177955	Super nice.
7177955	7178715	As nice.
7178715	7180537	Yeah, that is a sleek thing.
7180537	7183138	That's really cool.
7183138	7185179	And no wonder someone offered to buy it.
7185179	7185500	I know.
7185500	7189062	I was going to say, I see why somebody offered to buy that off you for sure.
7189062	7189682	Yeah.
7189682	7190082	Yeah.
7190082	7193504	Look at chat, too, because they're they're saying kind things about that, too.
7193504	7194065	Nice setup.
7194065	7194305	Yes.
7195086	7197550	So yeah, that's the thing I built.
7197550	7206563	I actually made a YouTube video because the video that I was on, that I was interviewed with, I think the channel is called Reversal, if anyone wants to look that up.
7208089	7215916	a lot of comments in there were asking about my arcade stick so I was like maybe I'll make a video to let people know like what I've done and kind of share my experience with it.
7215916	7224744	So if anyone looks that up, it's AJ Twists on YouTube and I have a couple of videos there of me talking about it, the build and you know going into it and stuff.
7226175	7231339	All right, well, with that promo, I will go ahead and let you wrap it up here.
7231339	7232220	Thanks so much for calling in.
7232220	7236724	It's good to hear from you and experience this Evo and showing that that is an amazing custom controller.
7236724	7243489	For the podcast listeners that can't see it, I would encourage you to definitely look at the YouTube that AJ just promoted there and check that out.
7243489	7245191	Looks great.
7245191	7245831	Yeah, thank you.
7245831	7246832	Well, thanks for calling in tonight.
7246832	7247332	Have a good one.
7247332	7247813	All right.
7247813	7248293	For sure.
7248293	7248714	You too.
7248714	7249474	Take care.
7249474	7249835	Yeah.
7249835	7250095	Bye-bye.
7251348	7251808	All right.
7251808	7253309	That was awesome.
7253309	7254010	All right.
7254010	7254850	That was really cool.
7254850	7256111	Yeah.
7256111	7256411	Okay.
7256411	7258832	Well, with that, we have no other calls waiting to come in.
7258832	7263675	And I think we, I always say it's going to be a short show and then we run at least two hours anyway.
7263675	7267217	So I think we're good to wrap things up here and close on out for the night.
7267217	7270459	But before we do that, we want to thank you as always for listening to our program.
7270459	7275042	Thank you so much for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio, especially on a week where, you know, a lot of people had the week off.
7275522	7277223	Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fall on Sunday this year.
7277223	7278243	Will there be shows those nights?
7304875	7308560	I can almost for sure say not on New Year's Eve.
7308560	7313105	Christmas Eve is a little more of a question mark for me.
7313105	7316490	I need to figure out- That's usually when Dan and I do our thing.
7316490	7320355	Okay, then it is very likely we are going to go two weeks with no show.
7320355	7320755	However,
7321596	7340268	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansensen, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Ranma, Act
7350794	7358742	I was going to say, usually I'm pretty free Christmas Eve, but last year we actually went out with a valid side of the family on Christmas Eve, so.
7358742	7362566	So that's something to propose possible.
7362566	7370854	I know that we're all kind of I don't I don't anticipate being busy, but would we consider doing a UK
7372338	7395819	time zone early show like or something like that because I know yeah like our UK listeners don't get to listen live very often that might be fun I'm open to that actually yeah um well let me just double triple check that what we're gonna do with Alan's side of the family just make sure I'm okay with that uh and then yeah I'm fine with an early show so our um folks overseas have a chance to tune in yeah absolutely we haven't done one of those in a while that's a great idea so but happy Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve
7397000	7399881	DarkSakura, I know you're probably gonna go off to stream some Dead by Daylight.
7399881	7401662	I'm very excited about Chucky by the way.
7401662	7402282	Is Chucky next week?
7426684	7427864	That's Tuesday.
7427864	7428384	Oh, yay.
7428384	7428904	That's exciting.
7428904	7430405	That would kind of get me to play again.
7430405	7432005	Actually, I'm not excited about Chucky.
7432005	7435186	I'm excited about Tiffany.
7435186	7440787	Yeah, well, I'm gonna be broke again, so there we go.
7440787	7443128	But I don't know.
7443128	7448129	That means I'll have to work on my adept for them.
7448129	7449729	So it'll be interesting.
7449729	7452670	I've got everybody done right now.
7452670	7453430	That's great.
7453430	7453910	Even Nurse.
7456055	7457615	All right, so what are you gonna do on tonight's stream?
7457615	7461597	Because I played her like a cheat bitch.
7461597	7466318	But yeah, we're gonna we're gonna dive into the debbies and who knows what else.
7466318	7468279	So all right, well, we'll see in a little bit.
7468279	7470019	Have a good stream.
7470019	7470979	See ya.
7470979	7471280	All right.
7471280	7474901	With that, I will go over to Loki your final thoughts tonight for us.
7474901	7477361	I have to do editing and I have to go back to work tomorrow.
7480441	7481662	Yeah.
7481662	7488466	Um, I don't think I have quite the negative feelings that Loki has, but I, I'm definitely like, Oh, this break was nice.
7488466	7490728	I should have taken another couple of days off.
7490728	7505678	Um, but you know, work it, the interesting thing about work is that it ends up being such a weird period between like, you know, Thanksgiving and Christmas because you know, it's a lot of like wrap up type of stuff, but also it's kind of like so many people go in and out on various holidays.
7505678	7510181	It's just, it feels like some things get done, but other things definitely don't get done.
7510561	7513004	Thanks for watching!
7528346	7530148	All right, well, that's it.
7530148	7532510	I don't really have anything else to say besides that.
7532510	7535153	We're going to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.
7535153	7537795	Thank you so much for listening to the show tonight.
7537795	7538956	We hope you all have a good week.
7538956	7541639	Hope those of you in the States had a great holiday.
7541639	7545002	If you're overseas, hope you had fun doing whatever else it was you were doing this week.
7545002	7550167	We'll be back in seven days to continue the gaming news and whatever happens.
