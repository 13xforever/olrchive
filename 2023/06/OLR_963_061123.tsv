0	11600	It's still a weird era.
11600	15000	Business people get advice from business people about what supposedly made them successful,
15000	18440	forgetting how much of it wasn't in their hands to begin with and never will be.
18440	22040	Twitch thinks their TV network can control all their content, so their rules about advertising
22040	24440	went over about as well as could be expected.
24440	26520	Time flows like a river, and history repeats.
26520	28200	Please support the people that do the work.
28200	30160	This is the One Step Forward, Five Leaps Back intro.
30160	33600	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
33600	36520	this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every
36520	38520	gamer has a voice.
38520	44140	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
44140	46920	where every gamer has a voice.
46920	49160	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
49160	56920	We are live once again, episode number 963 of our show for tonight, June 11th, 2023.
56920	59600	It's a little bit of a busy week in gaming.
59600	64160	We got a lot to get into, but first, let's introduce ourselves and get off topic.
64160	65480	My name is Rob Roberts.
65480	69860	I'm here with you every week, joined by my co-hosts, the one and only Dark Sakura or
69860	70860	Jamie Summers.
70860	71860	I'm mad at popcorn.
71860	74860	I need to go get some more.
74860	75860	That is a shame.
75860	83900	You might need some popcorn tonight with all the cutscenes, cinematics, epics, games coming.
83900	85360	It's delicious kettle corn.
85960	86960	The best.
86960	87960	My favorite.
87960	88960	The best.
88960	91160	After my day, I need it.
91160	95080	Let me cycle back to that real quick, but first, let me say hello as well to Tech Master
95080	96080	Loki.
96080	97080	Hello.
97080	98080	Hi, Loki.
98080	99080	How are you?
99080	100080	Doing good.
100080	103540	Trying to figure out the game behind you playing, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday
103540	107680	night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of the Geeks Network, twitch.tv
107680	113680	slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.
113680	114680	You can see video.
114680	115680	It is a podcast.
115680	119200	We try to be mindful of that and keep it very audio based, but sometimes there's just some
119200	122560	fun little things on the video, and the one is I'm trying to figure out what that game
122560	125880	is playing behind Loki on his little webcam tonight.
125880	129160	It was a Super Nintendo game.
129160	132480	Is it the one with the guy playing the banjo on the cover?
132480	133480	No.
133480	134480	That's-
134480	135480	No.
135480	136480	That's a shooter game.
136480	137480	Equinox or something like that.
137480	138480	No.
138480	139480	Equinox was a Sony game.
139480	140520	Flannix, I think, was a game.
140520	141520	That game.
141520	142520	Yeah.
142520	143520	Yeah.
143520	144520	This is Cybernator.
145360	150600	Oh, because there was an NES version of that, wasn't there, or an earlier version or something?
150600	151600	I thought.
151600	152600	Maybe.
152600	153600	Maybe.
153600	154600	Maybe.
154600	155600	Maybe.
155600	156600	There's a game that was similar.
156600	157600	Yeah.
157600	158600	Okay.
158600	159600	I don't remember.
159600	160600	Well, Dark Tetsuya and chat got it.
160600	161600	Ding, ding, ding.
161600	162600	Maybe Cybernator.
162600	163600	So, there it is.
163600	164600	You got it.
164600	165600	Yes, and Flannix was the game I was trying to think of with the epic-
165600	166600	Hey, Link.
166600	167600	No.
167600	168600	The guy playing the banjo.
168600	174040	It's the banjo game because the box art was this infamous guy playing the banjo that had
174560	179400	literally nothing to do with the game.
179400	180800	I don't know why-
180800	184440	And it intrigued you, and you had to rent it then, and you're like-
184440	185440	Yeah.
185440	189640	It really was one of those things where it's like, I have to rent this because I don't
189640	191800	know what the hell this is.
191800	193040	I really don't.
193040	196920	I'm not able to find a very large picture of this box art, but I found a little tiny
196920	199400	one there that I can put on stream.
199400	200400	That's what it looked like.
200760	206160	It's honestly a game I should cover because it was a completely different game and had
206160	209960	a really good X68000 release.
209960	210960	Mm-hmm.
210960	211960	Yeah, it's-
211960	212960	Of course.
212960	217160	Dark Tetsuya says, I mean, people still talk about it 30 years later, so mission accomplished.
217160	218160	Clearly.
218160	219160	Clearly mission accomplished.
219160	220160	All right.
220160	224840	We are going to get into some gaming news, but first, Dark Sakura, I know you were talking
224840	231000	about your day, and I wanted to give you some space to vent if you need it.
231000	235560	Oh, it's not really a vent per se.
235560	240360	I had posted earlier that Midna was having some problems.
240360	243320	She had been twitching on her jaw.
243320	247800	Her lower jaw would just twitch, and she'd be licking the top of her mouth, and she was
247800	253120	drooling excessively, but she didn't have bad breath.
253400	263920	The biggest sign that she would have had stomatitis, I believe it is, which is a more advanced,
263920	271280	terrible form of gingivitis, so she didn't have bad breath or anything, and she was doing
271280	277040	other stuff, but whenever I'd go to wipe her mouth with a towel, she'd hiss really badly.
277040	278040	That was yesterday.
278040	283240	My friend Heather, she was a vet tech.
283240	290080	I sent her videos, but because Midna didn't have the bad breath or anything, we were thinking
290080	294400	that it might be neurological, like she had a seizure or an episode or something, until
294400	303840	I sent her a video of Midna eating and trying to get in my face to take some bonito flakes.
303840	310640	We saw her tooth was at a 45-degree angle.
310640	312560	Her appointment was on Tuesday.
312560	317560	I didn't know if I needed to get her into an emergency vet, so I couldn't find my forceps
317560	324280	either, so I sterilized some pliers, and I was just going to see, is it loose?
324280	329640	I barely touched it, and it came out, so Midna's feeling better.
329640	337880	She started eating almost immediately, little hog, cleaning herself.
337880	342720	She's over on the other chair, just chilling.
342720	349640	For anyone who is like, oh no, no way in this thing, it just came out.
349640	350640	It just came out.
350640	351880	I hardly did it.
351880	354520	It just needed a little push.
354520	357120	Or a pull in this case.
357120	360760	It wiggled once and came out, and Midna didn't act any other way.
360760	366280	In fact, she seemed pretty happy when it was gone.
366280	378720	I do have some Chloracin, which is an antibacterial mouth rinse, although they put orange flavor
378720	383640	in it, which is stupid, because citrus scents and flavors are a deterrent to cats.
383640	385640	They hate them.
385680	396440	Midna's extra pissed off about that, but she's still going to get it used for a few days.
396440	404560	And yeah, she's probably going to be on some antibiotics after I take her to the vet, because
404560	407240	I don't want it to get infected.
407240	411480	I'm just afraid that they might need to see if there's any more debris in there, and that's
411480	417360	the part where I don't know if I'm going to have all the money for that, but on a completely
417360	423520	unrelated topic, I have the world's smallest Birkin bag.
423520	429600	For anyone who doesn't know, it's actually a miniature version of an Hermes Birkin in
429600	438400	a nice cappuccino color, and I got a traction machine, but I think they sent me the wrong
438400	448240	one, and yeah, that's been my IRL week, but mostly it's just been Midna for the last couple
448240	452480	of days, and she was so miserable.
452480	457920	If I had seen it sooner, I could have yanked that tooth out, but at least she's done this
457920	458920	time.
458920	459920	At least it's done now, and she's doing better now.
459920	460920	Yeah.
460920	461920	Yeah.
461920	462920	I'm a cat surgeon.
462920	463920	Just kidding.
463920	464920	I'm not.
464920	465920	All right.
465920	466920	I'm keeping the tooth.
466920	467920	Cats are important.
468440	475440	I want to say a bit of a personal note before we get into the gaming news, because I just
475440	477640	made an announcement at the end of Bobby's show here.
477640	481880	I want to make sure I repeat it here for the OLR audience, and that is I'm not going to
481880	484280	be making one trip to Atlanta this year.
484280	486320	I'm going to be making two.
486320	492040	I'm very excited to announce I'm going to be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo the weekend
492040	497840	of July 28th through the 30th, and this is at the Marriott Renaissance Waverly where
497840	498840	that's happening.
498840	504520	It's very similar in many ways to the show out here that's California Extreme, but they
504520	508240	have some celebrity guests, and it's been getting bigger and bigger, and it's their
508240	513600	10th anniversary year out there, so I'm very excited to go out and take part in that.
513600	514600	Check that out.
514600	518640	I'm hoping to be involved with some panels and do some fun things out there that weekend
518640	519640	in July.
519640	526760	July 28th through the 30th, the Southern Fried Gaming Expo in Atlanta, and I will also still
526760	532240	this year be at Dragon Con, so I'm taking two trips to Atlanta about five weeks apart,
532240	535880	but the Southern Fried trip is only a long weekend.
535880	539840	I literally get in on a Thursday night, and I go out Monday morning.
539840	542320	It's just a long weekend.
542320	546320	Dragon Con, I'm there for an entire week as usual, because Dragon Con is a very long con,
546320	547320	but yeah.
547320	552160	Man, any excuse you can to beat Bobby's score at pinball, I mean, I swear.
552160	553160	Right?
553160	554160	Well, the nice-
554160	555680	This rivalry's getting out of control.
555680	559520	The nice thing about Southern Fried Gaming Expo is that they have an entire room filled
559520	564000	with pinball games that I can get the high score on, or at least, if nothing else, I
564000	566960	probably won't get the high, high score, because there's a lot of very good players there,
566960	571800	but at least beat Bobby's score on as many of the machines as possible, because he can't
571800	578040	ban me from that arcade as long as I am a registered member of the con, which I will
578040	579040	be.
579040	582640	So yes, I'm looking forward to my stupid beginner's luck.
582640	586040	You know that's all it is, is stupid beginner's luck, because I think I talked about it last
586040	591440	week, or a couple weeks ago on the show, when I was in San Diego for work, one of the nights
591440	596200	I went to a coin-op place there that had some pinball games, and I played that Avengers
596200	602440	table for the first time, and I won a free game twice.
602440	607360	That's how ridiculous my beginner's luck was on that table, so there is that, but that's
607360	612840	why I love the Stern connected thing, because when nobody believes me that I did that, I
612840	616560	can be like, see, I have the score and the achievements to prove it, my little Stern
616560	619600	insider thing, so that's something they're doing very well.
619600	621860	All right.
621860	628300	Let's get into a lot of gaming news from this week, because this would have been E3 week,
628300	633820	this coming week would have been E3 week, but obviously not happening, but what did
633820	639540	happen, Summer Game Fest this last week, and then of course this morning, Xbox had a showcase.
639540	643300	So let's start, and then there's actually other things been going on as well, but we're
643300	647660	going to start tonight talking about Summer Game Fest, which happened a few days ago.
647660	650380	Unfortunately, I was not able to watch this live.
650380	655700	I had to get kind of a recap of this, but I kind of caught up on all the news and what
655700	656700	happened.
656700	660860	So first, let's talk about the Prince of Persia, Lost Crown.
660860	665700	So this is a game that's kind of like a 2.5D adventure, it looks a little more like a classic
665700	668460	Prince of Persia title than one of the newer titles.
668460	673680	This is going to be coming out in January, January 18th, 2024, assuming it doesn't get
673680	675460	delayed or anything.
675460	678540	But this honestly, right off the bat, this is probably one of the more exciting titles
678540	680040	out of the whole showcase for me.
680040	685060	So I'm definitely down with Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown, and sort of finding the roots
685060	688580	a little bit of the series.
688580	692980	Another, we went right from that into Mortal Kombat 1.
692980	696480	We are starting over, says the Mortal Kombat team.
696480	701460	As they go into Mortal Kombat 1, they really did some in-depth gameplay for this, and then
701460	706820	some of the crazy changes that are going on as well, and the Cameo system, which will
706820	710460	let you call in additional characters to help during a fight.
710460	716180	So you can bring in Baraka, Goro, Striker, and Sonya are some examples of Cameo fighters.
716180	723300	So that's an interesting kind of, it feels very like Capcom fighter from the 90s, where
723300	725300	you would tag team people.
725300	727620	They don't take it, they just come in to do a move.
727620	730340	There was absolutely a Capcom fighter like that, more than one.
730340	731700	Yeah, more than one.
731700	734980	There's several where you just tag them in and they do a move.
734980	736180	Yeah, yeah.
736180	738620	That one, Superheroes and Street Fighters, the one I definitely remember.
738620	740740	So that'll be fun.
740740	744420	So Mortal Kombat 1, I think people are very excited about.
744420	746380	That is coming out September 19th.
746380	750600	So the nice thing about the Mortal Kombat team, they usually don't tease games until
750600	751760	they're about ready to go.
751760	754740	So Mortal Kombat 1 is out in just a few months.
754740	758180	Sonic Superstars, this looked kind of cool too.
758180	763140	This is going to involve multiple playable characters, co-op gameplay for up to four
763140	767420	people and you can run up walls and waterfalls.
767420	773100	That's going to be out for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X, and Nintendo Switch all this
773100	774100	fall.
774100	779220	So a little bit more of like a, I don't, I always say like a kind of like more of a game
779220	783180	in Sonic's roots a little bit.
783180	789100	Because it's not, it's not like the more recent title, but it definitely looks, it looks very
789100	790100	cool.
790100	794140	It's a bit more like Mania, you know, like more of the classics on the game, the last
794140	799460	one they went really in the other direction, everyone's like, no, don't do that.
799460	803820	Well, the vibe I kind of get from it, honestly, and not, not completely, but like just a vibe
803820	809420	is the new Super Mario Brothers games that were on like Wii U and stuff, which were four
809420	810420	player.
810420	811740	That's kind of like the vibe I get from it.
811740	816460	It's kind of like that, but for Sonic, but like not a literal clone, like it's, it's
816460	817980	doing its very Sonic thing.
817980	821300	Like these, it looks very chaotic and fun, honestly.
821300	826340	Yeah, I think this Sonic title, I'm going to be quite honest, looks more exciting than
826340	830300	a lot of Sonic titles have been in a long time for me, just because it invokes like
830300	832020	that classic Sonic feel to it.
832020	833380	You know what I mean?
833380	836540	So Sonic Superstars, really looking forward to that.
836540	842020	A horror game called Toxic Commando is coming from one of the all time greats in horror,
842020	844940	John Carpenter and Saber Interactive.
844940	848100	You'll be fighting zombies with guns and vehicles.
848100	852420	Yeah, just John Carpenter's name alone on this is going to make people pay attention.
852420	856020	I can't say I blame them for that.
856020	858180	And we got Spider-Man 2.
858180	860980	This is probably one of the other big reveals out of the whole thing.
860980	865740	We have a date, October 20th, exclusive to the PlayStation 5, of course.
865740	872980	We have Spider-Man 2 is going to be coming out and Queens and Brooklyn are fully explorable
873020	877020	in the game because it's a very open world type of game and rooted in New York.
877020	878720	So that'll be very cool.
878720	884000	If you are a Fortnite fan, chapter four, season three is coming out.
884000	888900	It's called Wilds and the big new character in this is going to be Optimus Prime.
888900	894820	So if you want to play as a transformer in Fortnite, if you want to be a transformer
894820	901700	fighting Ariana Grande, wielding Jedi superpowers, Fortnite is now the game for you because it's
901700	906120	literally the blender of all these pop culture things, which is what they've been saying
906120	908620	for quite some time.
908620	911780	There's one more pretty major thing I'm going to let Dark Soccer talk about in a minute,
911780	914340	but I want to do some other quick hits here.
914340	917340	New trailer for Path of Exile 2.
917340	922660	Exo Primal is going to get some skins for the mechs based on Street Fighter 6, Ryu and
922660	923660	Guile.
923660	926660	Tiny bit of a deeper dive on Nicolas Cage in Dead by Daylight.
926660	931420	And of course, Nicolas Cage actually showed up to basically give the, I'm Nicolas Cage
931460	933940	and I approve this message type of thing.
933940	935780	That's going to be coming out on July 25th.
935780	937780	His model doesn't look anything like him.
937780	938780	I mean, barely.
938780	939780	It's a mild resemblance.
939780	942300	It looks a lot like him.
942300	944340	Looks better.
944340	948180	It's hot Nicolas Cage, I'm on down with the model to be honest.
948180	952140	The facial structure is there, the expressions there, it's pretty dead on.
952140	954620	It's younger, which is, you know, it's fine.
954620	960780	I mean, it's meant to be a video game, it's Nick Cage.
960780	964660	Also The Witcher Season 3 Volume 1 had a new trailer.
964660	970300	Witchfire is going to be entering early access on the Epic Game Store September 20th.
970300	975100	New gameplay trailer showed off for Remnant 2, a live action trailer and a release date
975100	978620	in August for Crossfire Sierra Squad.
978620	982780	PlayStation 5 is going to be getting the game that I'm seeing more and more of on Twitch.
982780	987200	Honkai Star Rail is going to be coming out on PlayStation 5 during Quarter 4 this year.
987200	990960	That of course from the same people that brought Genshin Impact, so it's a similar
990960	996500	vibe, although it's a little more standard RPG mechanics from what I understand.
996500	1000000	Lies of P got a demo and a release date of September 19th.
1000000	1001000	Yeah, it looks pretty good.
1001000	1002000	Yeah.
1002000	1007600	Sand Land based on Akira Toriyama's Sand Land, a game that's going to be based on that.
1007600	1009640	It's coming out.
1009640	1015620	Annapurna mentioned they're going to be doing their own showcase on June 29th to show off
1015620	1017780	some upcoming games.
1017780	1022680	New free-to-play MMO Throne and Liberty with a trailer, War Haven with a new trailer, Party
1022680	1029140	Animals with a release date, Dying Light 2 has some gameplay updates, Alan Wake 2 had
1029140	1032980	an extended gameplay video and Keely had interviewed Sam Lake on stage.
1032980	1035780	I think a lot of people are very excited about Alan Wake 2.
1035780	1039140	I'm definitely excited to see what music they've licensed for it because the first game had
1039140	1041460	an amazing soundtrack, that's for sure.
1041460	1047700	Yes, Your Grace Snowfall, which is a sequel, got a 2024 release window.
1047700	1049420	There was an awful lot going on.
1049420	1052460	A lot of it was finally some dates, really, for some things.
1052460	1059460	A limited Xbox Series X for the Porsche's 75th anniversary.
1059460	1064940	Star Trek Infinite, a 4X game from Paradox, is going to be coming out as well.
1064940	1069780	There's a game I missed that you wanted to mention, by all means do so, and there's one
1069780	1071780	more, actually.
1071780	1079620	Also we got a clip from the new Twisted Metal show, which, eh, is alright.
1079620	1081780	Loki's being very generous, in my opinion.
1081780	1088780	I guess maybe if you enjoy bad shit- Here's the thing, I know it's trash.
1088780	1094740	I know it's trash, it's like Fast Five, or like the Fast and the Furious series.
1094740	1098380	I know going in it's going to be trash.
1098380	1101380	I've set my expectation for trash.
1101380	1102380	I'm fine with that.
1102380	1112900	I like Anthony Mackie, and I like Will Arnett, so I'm ready for trash in the Twisted Metal
1112900	1113900	world.
1113900	1116260	I don't expect anything great out of it.
1116260	1122180	And I'm happy for you, Loki, and that's about where my excitement ends.
1122180	1125420	But in all seriousness, I think something all three of us can get behind, this was the
1125420	1128220	one that everyone was talking about, Dark Sakura.
1128220	1130460	What was the big, big reveal of this show?
1130460	1139220	It was Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is the second installation of the remake series.
1139220	1141460	And it's very pretty.
1141460	1142460	Very pretty.
1142460	1148260	It's supposed to be like the middle part of the game, where you're outside wandering around,
1148260	1153140	going hither and yon.
1153140	1155260	It's very pretty.
1155260	1159180	I like the voice acting.
1159180	1167620	I can see where they're going with the foreshadowing in there too, so that's pretty good.
1167620	1172540	And I feel like they really are now flexing that they're going to do whatever the fuck
1172540	1173540	they want in this.
1173540	1178660	I mean, I know you mentioned they're following the story a little bit, but okay, there's
1178660	1182300	this whole interesting thing that came out about in the Japanese version of the trailer.
1182300	1185500	So something that happens towards the end of the trailer is that there's this whole
1185500	1192420	scene where it looks like Sephiroth is looking at Tifa or something, and he actually says
1192420	1198620	something in the Japanese trailer about, I killed Tifa or something like that.
1198620	1202360	I don't remember what the words were, but obviously they're not going to give away a
1202360	1205300	bombshell thing like that in the trailer.
1205300	1211220	It's obviously some type of mind fuck, like was it a fake version or an alternate reality
1211220	1215680	version because obviously there's something going on because you can't say I killed this
1215680	1218220	person and then the person is sitting right in front of you.
1218220	1222940	There's obviously some weird shit going on, but there's just that whole concept of, wait
1222940	1228120	a minute, they might kill somebody besides Aerith, which, spoiler alert, already happened
1228120	1235000	in the first game, and then he was brought back to life, but in the second game, clearly
1235000	1236060	they can do whatever they want.
1236060	1237060	But I just-
1237060	1238060	Hold on.
1238060	1239060	Oh, what?
1239580	1241780	I'm going to see what he said.
1241780	1243620	I'm going to hear it for myself.
1243620	1244620	Oh, okay.
1244620	1251220	Yeah, there's a translation version somewhere out there with subtitles.
1251220	1254940	But anyway, while you're checking that out, I will just mention, just because I've had
1254940	1260160	that kind of year, I do want to say about six years ago when this series was first announced,
1260160	1264260	I said they can do whatever the hell they want this time, and I think they'll kill Tifa
1264260	1266900	instead of Aerith just to get fanboys upset.
1266900	1275900	So by God, if that does come true, I'm writing a book, why I'm so goddamn smart at video
1275900	1277700	games by Rob Roberts.
1277700	1283860	One thing though I should point out is that the scene there, at least as far as how it
1283860	1287660	was in the old game, was from their flashback.
1287660	1293240	She wore that outfit as like a tour guide or something when they found the Genova facility
1293240	1295540	the first time.
1295540	1299980	So that's all in flashback.
1299980	1303260	So Mishkins in chat says, I feel like that might be a dream sequence, like someone's
1303260	1304260	having a dream.
1304260	1305860	And in it they say, I killed Tifa.
1305860	1306860	Oh yeah, there's absolutely...
1306860	1310140	Well, they didn't say I killed Tifa, he said, I killed her.
1310140	1311140	Who is she?
1311140	1314300	No, they're talking about the Japanese version.
1314300	1316740	In the Japanese one, they say, yeah.
1316740	1322840	But here's the thing, look, it's not worth over-analyzing because they do misdirects
1322840	1324920	in movie trailers all the time.
1324920	1331600	Or because I love to relate everything to RuPaul's Drag Race, there was a scene in the
1331600	1336080	trailer for season five where Alaska goes, I've had it with everybody.
1336080	1338200	She goes, I fucking hate it here.
1338200	1340460	And then you find out it was like, she's acting.
1340460	1344860	And they got her to say that in the clip, like had nothing to do with her actually being
1344860	1345860	mad at anybody.
1345860	1349820	Like it's just, they do that type of misdirect shit all the time in trailers just to get
1349820	1350820	you riled up.
1350820	1356300	So, did you want to say anything else on that, Darcyra?
1356300	1361580	I listened to the phrase and he literally did said, I'm the one that killed Tifa.
1361580	1362580	Yeah.
1362580	1363580	So...
1363580	1365020	I went to listen to it.
1365020	1371220	But if you, again, I think in the very beginning of that trailer, you see all of the characters
1371220	1376540	coming out in stretchers and Midgar, so something weird's going on.
1376540	1380700	So it's, it's just, and if you played the first game, you know, there's all sorts of
1380700	1384780	weird timeline fuckery and things that have been altered from its original state and so
1384780	1385780	forth.
1385780	1391800	You know, it's, again, I can't keep hiding the major twists in Final Fantasy Remake from
1391800	1395660	you much longer because they're going to be essential to Rebirth and talking about the
1395660	1398340	game and why it's going to go in a different direction.
1398340	1404300	So but yeah, it's, I was very hyped for the trailer.
1404300	1407900	Oh, you know, the other part of the trailer that was huge news.
1407900	1411060	It says it's two discs.
1411060	1412060	Excuse me?
1412060	1413980	Taking all of your storage space.
1413980	1414980	Excuse me?
1414980	1418820	This game is so big, you need two Blu-rays.
1418820	1426180	One Blu-ray disc is not enough to handle the second part of a game.
1426180	1429900	That's big news too, as far as I'm concerned.
1429900	1434180	RIP to the bandwidth caps of those that still have them for those that decide to get the
1434180	1435760	game digitally.
1435760	1436760	My goodness.
1436760	1440060	Well, if you have a PlayStation 5 digital edition.
1440060	1441060	Oops.
1441060	1442060	Oops.
1442060	1443060	Yeah.
1443060	1447220	I hope you have unlimited bandwidth or something or you're going to be playing on the cloud.
1447220	1448220	I don't know.
1448220	1451500	Or you can maybe like download like the first part and then the second part the following
1451500	1452500	month or something like that.
1452500	1453500	I don't know.
1453500	1456740	Quest Buster does point out Horizon Forbidden West is also on two discs.
1456740	1458100	Oh, even on PS5 it was?
1458100	1459100	I did not know that.
1459300	1460300	Okay.
1460300	1463180	But I'd also kind of believe it.
1463180	1466100	Quest Buster says, get a snack for long installs.
1466100	1469900	Mike Def says, 200 gigabytes plus updates.
1469900	1475200	Well, look Square, you better minimize those day one updates.
1475200	1479100	Let me tell you, because by the way, the other thing that they snuck in a pushback, did you
1479100	1482440	notice they snuck in a delay with that game as well?
1482440	1486660	Now it's quarter one 2024, because it was supposed to be this year, because remember
1486660	1490900	we were talking about, oh, Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 part two in the same
1490900	1491900	year.
1491900	1492900	Wow.
1492900	1498120	And I, again, I don't want to toot my own horn, but I was saying several weeks ago,
1498120	1501000	it's probably going to slip in the first quarter.
1501000	1502000	And here we are.
1502000	1505640	And, but it's, I don't think it's a big deal, especially now when you hear like exactly
1505640	1507580	how much is going into the game.
1507580	1512120	And quite frankly, again, if a delay can minimize those day one patches, I think most people
1512120	1518720	will be very grateful to hear it, quite honestly, so.
1518720	1524120	They've also been teasing things on Twitter about that game, basically that like, it ranges
1524120	1531640	from the really fucking obvious to the not so obvious, like, yes, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth
1531640	1538800	will have a new soundtrack with some new songs, as well as remixed songs from the original.
1538800	1541500	Holy fucking shit, what an announcement.
1541500	1545540	Like what a breaking news alarm of Final Fantasy 7.
1545540	1546540	Oh my god.
1546540	1549540	Video game to have soundtrack?
1549540	1550700	What?
1550700	1551700	You don't say.
1551700	1554540	Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.
1554540	1555540	What?
1555540	1556540	I just went back.
1556540	1560380	I know I keep going back to the thing you said, what he actually says is I should have
1560380	1561380	killed Tifa.
1561380	1562380	Hmm.
1562380	1563380	Interesting.
1563380	1564380	All right.
1564380	1565380	Well, look.
1565380	1566380	Anyway.
1566380	1568460	We'll find out in a few months.
1568460	1574500	But the other thing, then there also was one that said basically the developers feel you
1574500	1578980	don't have to play the first game to pick up this game, which is the smart thing to
1578980	1584260	do, you know, because let's be real, there are some people that are going to be 21 when
1584260	1589880	this game comes out that were like 16 or 17 when the other one came out.
1589880	1593540	And maybe they're just now getting around to buying their own PS5 and what have you,
1593540	1594540	you know, whatever.
1594540	1595620	There's a variety of reasons.
1595620	1598260	People may have just missed the first game or don't want to put the time into play it,
1598260	1599620	but want to play this one.
1599620	1602780	So it's nice that they'll have a catch up.
1602780	1604460	Here's the thing, though.
1604460	1609060	It doesn't mean it'll be a good catch up mechanic, but if they're smart, they'll put out one
1609060	1616100	of those things on YouTube that's like recapping the first Final Fantasy 7 game in seven minutes.
1616100	1620700	That's what they should do if they are, you know, wanting to make sure they get everybody
1620700	1622860	up to speed, which I mean, you could.
1622860	1627060	You could recap the key points of the game in seven minutes and be up to speed.
1627060	1629020	So we'll see.
1629020	1630700	All right.
1630700	1631780	That was Summer Game Fest.
1631780	1633260	How did you feel about it?
1633260	1635980	Did you watch the event live, Loki, or some of it?
1635980	1636980	Yes, I did.
1636980	1637980	What did you think?
1637980	1640300	Because again, I had to kind of watch the highlight reel after the fact.
1640300	1642660	I want to get your take on how was it live.
1642660	1647660	Do you think it was a worthy press event successor to some of the E3 hype?
1647660	1648820	Like, where's your head at with it?
1648820	1650740	It's about what it was last year.
1650740	1651740	It wasn't anything.
1651740	1653100	It was like, it was all right.
1653100	1657420	You know, still hoping for granted that six trailers, but that never happens.
1657420	1659940	So, you know, I'll just leave disappointed.
1659940	1661780	But no, it was OK.
1661780	1664540	Like I think they had some pretty good stuff in there.
1664540	1665540	Yeah.
1665540	1670200	I think one thing it did is it set up the holiday pretty well, you know, especially
1670200	1674020	for things that are outside of the big three, you know, outside of Sony.
1674020	1678540	And there even was stuff in a little bit from, you know, with Sony and Spider-Man and stuff.
1678540	1682660	But otherwise, for the most part, you know, the big three kind of do their own things
1682700	1687340	and what have you, it set up the holiday very well for what you would expect from E3 otherwise.
1687340	1691380	Because if you think about it, most of what you would see on the show floor at E3, especially
1691380	1694940	the things that were playable, were things that were going to be coming out that holiday.
1694940	1699500	And there's something to be said about in later years, especially how you would start
1699500	1702060	seeing later and later things getting announced.
1702060	1705960	But in the heydays of E3, it was really about what was going to be out that holiday, what
1705960	1708320	should be out on store shelves.
1708320	1712220	And I think a lot of the updates and the things that they were showing, it was setting up
1712220	1717140	the holiday very well for a plethora of third parties and all these...
1717140	1721380	I don't want to group it together under miscellaneous content because that makes it sound very like
1721380	1724960	other and unimportant, but that's really, you know, outside the big three, that's really
1724960	1725960	what it was.
1725960	1729700	So I feel like it did a very good job where E3 does not exist anymore of setting up the
1729700	1731840	holiday for everybody else.
1731840	1735700	And that's kind of what I got out of Summer Game Fest as a whole.
1735700	1738620	So could it have been better?
1738620	1742740	Maybe, but I feel like some of the big publishers want to save some of it for themselves, you
1742740	1744620	know, and that's just the reality.
1744620	1751500	There's still a lot of different press events that are showcases, people that are coming
1751500	1752500	later this month.
1752500	1755820	So, yeah, a lot of that's going to be kind of held back until those come out.
1755820	1756820	Yeah.
1756820	1757820	I would say it's...
1757820	1760100	I know we're going to talk about it later in the show, but I would say it's a far better
1760100	1766100	miscellaneous event than the PC gaming show, but we'll talk about that later.
1766100	1767180	Let's go on a heyday.
1767180	1774540	I thought this was another relatively strong announcement, was this morning's Xbox event.
1774540	1775840	Loki, I'll turn it over to you.
1775840	1779900	This one I did watch live, but I'm kind of curious on your take and walk us through some
1779900	1781900	of the things that were announced.
1781900	1785660	So they had a bunch of different trailers for different things that we were anticipating
1785660	1787620	trailers being there.
1787620	1793020	So one of those being Fable, they showed off a cinematic trailer that kind of let you know,
1793020	1794460	hey, we're still working on it.
1794460	1795460	And I liked it.
1795460	1796460	I thought it was funny.
1796740	1799340	Well, and Richard Ayode being in it is huge.
1799340	1801540	Yeah, that was fantastic.
1801540	1805140	Yeah, literally huge.
1805140	1811500	My one bitch about the Fable thing, though, was that like the gameplay, it was there,
1811500	1813380	but it was blink an eye and you'll miss it.
1813380	1818580	I'm pretty sure that whole sequence where the hero, she was running from the giant thing.
1818580	1821900	I think that was gameplay.
1821900	1822900	That was it, though.
1823220	1828300	I still don't have a sense of like, look, we haven't really had a Fable game in a really
1828300	1834180	long time, and I'm excited for playground games to kind of like get to do their take
1834180	1836420	on it in the Forza engine and everything.
1836420	1841780	So I was hoping for a little more about like, what is the game actually going to be type
1841780	1842780	of thing.
1842780	1848740	And I just feel like, OK, it's going to have the dry British sense of humor stuff.
1848740	1849740	That's fine.
1849740	1850740	Which it does.
1850740	1851740	It does.
1851740	1852740	Yeah, it was cute.
1853180	1854180	You're not losing that.
1854180	1856740	It looks like the story will be cute.
1856740	1863500	But I was just hoping for a little more of the game to excite me and keep me going after
1863500	1866100	years and years of nothing on the Fable front.
1866100	1867820	That's my only little bitch.
1867820	1872540	But I, you know, the fact that they have the star power now with Richard Aida and everything
1872540	1874500	is great.
1874500	1875500	So yeah.
1875500	1876500	Yeah.
1876500	1880980	And that is unfortunately, a lot of the trailers don't really show much as far as gameplay
1880980	1881980	goes.
1882100	1886980	Let me get some other comments from chat, sorry, over twitch.tv slash vog network.
1886980	1891180	She Hulk 10 says, well, as far as I'm concerned, this new Fable looked nothing like Fable.
1891180	1893540	The trailer is just there to say, hey, this game exists.
1893540	1894940	Trust us.
1894940	1897540	Starfield saved the show, which we'll talk a little bit about that later.
1897540	1902660	SG100Matt says, I was meh on a new Fable game, but with playground games doing it, that got
1902660	1903660	my interest.
1903660	1904660	Yeah.
1904660	1907300	The developers there, the humor is there.
1907300	1909180	The star power is there.
1909180	1910740	Is the game there?
1910820	1911900	I think it's going to be good.
1911900	1912900	I hope.
1912900	1913900	I hope.
1913900	1914900	But I, okay.
1914900	1915900	Okay.
1915900	1918100	So clearly this is not happening this year.
1918100	1924300	So you're, you're, they need a pass until holiday 2024 yet, but I hope the gameplay
1924300	1928980	trailer that inevitably comes next year is real good.
1928980	1929980	Real good.
1929980	1932100	As far as it looking like Fable, I'm okay.
1932100	1936580	If they've got a radically different direction, it has been like 10 years and it's a new studio.
1936580	1941060	So I'm, I'm okay if it, you know, they've kind of turned the car around, so to speak
1941060	1942660	and gone a different direction with it.
1942660	1943660	Yeah.
1943660	1944660	All right.
1944660	1945660	Anyway.
1945660	1946660	Sorry.
1946660	1947660	I have a lot to say on Fable though.
1947660	1951140	So there was, um, a lot of these member of those games, all the different game studios
1951140	1952460	that they purchased way back.
1952460	1953900	It's been a while now.
1953900	1957220	Um, well now we're starting to see all those games that are in development.
1957220	1963420	So for example, from the devs that did We Happy Few, we had South of Midnight, which
1963420	1965140	it was kind of a cinematic trailer.
1965140	1968820	Not really sure what the gameplay is going to be there, but it looks interesting.
1968820	1974580	Kind of like this whole like Voodoo Bayou type of a vibe to it, which I like.
1974580	1981700	And then, um, we've got a little peek at Star Wars Outlaws, which is an Ubisoft Star Wars
1981700	1982700	game.
1982700	1986440	And they're going to be showing more of that at the Ubisoft showcase, uh, which is coming
1986440	1987900	out later this month.
1987900	1991740	That looked interesting, but again, it was a case of too much trailer and not enough
1991740	1992740	game.
1993060	1996780	But if you're a Star Wars fan, you were horny for it.
1996780	1997780	I'm sure you were.
1997780	2001540	It looked really, really, really good just from like a Star Wars lore perspective.
2001540	2006660	So yeah, and it's at least, at least it's coupled with this thing is coming in like
2006660	2007660	a day or two.
2007660	2009220	So like Ubisoft's going to show the gameplay.
2009220	2011180	It's just, we have to wait just a couple more days.
2011180	2015340	So kind of those two things together, I'm a lot more okay with what they did.
2015340	2016340	Yeah.
2016420	2022580	From, um, the devs of Spiritfarer, we had a game called 33, uh, what was it?
2022580	2024540	Uh, 33 Immortals, I think.
2024540	2025540	Yeah.
2025540	2027540	Hades inspired games now it looks like.
2027540	2028540	Yeah.
2028540	2029540	Yeah.
2029540	2030540	Like multiplayer.
2030540	2033020	It's a 33 player co-op game.
2033020	2034620	I mean, that sounds cool.
2034620	2036940	Honestly like Hades 99 or whatever.
2036940	2038040	I'm here for it.
2038040	2040420	Like that could be really fun actually.
2040420	2042220	So um, yeah, neat.
2042220	2043220	Yeah.
2043220	2044220	That looked pretty cool.
2044220	2050700	Uh, Payday three as announced there is it's coming on game pass as well and it looks like
2050700	2051700	payday.
2051700	2052700	So, okay.
2052700	2053700	Okay.
2053700	2054700	Um, can I be honest?
2054700	2055700	Loki?
2055700	2056700	Look, I know you like the payday games.
2056700	2059540	I, I'm not really a fan of the payday game.
2059540	2060540	I'm sorry.
2060540	2062060	I just have to be honest.
2062060	2069620	The parts in game of payday did not look current gen to me and it didn't, it did not look,
2069620	2073860	it looked very plain.
2073860	2075500	It just, it is not exciting.
2075500	2079340	It was not exciting, but maybe these are because I don't get into these kinds of games usually
2079340	2085880	admittedly, but I just, this trailer like made me go this, I'm supposed to get excited
2085880	2088420	about this cause I, I didn't at all.
2088420	2090540	Like it just, it was, it was almost kind of bad.
2090540	2091540	I'm sorry.
2091540	2095560	I feel, I always feel bad when I shit on games before I've played them, but like I was not
2095560	2097820	excited about what I saw at all.
2097820	2100660	Um, let's see what else.
2100660	2102940	We had a persona three reloaded.
2102940	2108220	So our persona three reload, which is going to be coming to game pass as well.
2108220	2110060	Uh, so that's like pretty neat.
2110060	2112300	Did you hear about everything persona three doesn't have in it though?
2112300	2116940	It has like none of the extra content and they replaced all of the voice actors.
2116940	2118740	All of the voice actors are new.
2118740	2120180	Well here's the weird thing.
2120180	2125060	Like for the most part, yes, I would agree, but I feel like the whole thing was done to
2125060	2130300	get rid of one voice actor in particular whose name is Vic McGoon.
2130300	2131400	Yeah.
2131400	2136840	So I have a feeling, unfortunately, contraction on stuff in order to get the association with
2136840	2140600	that guy gone, they had to replace everybody.
2140600	2144200	And so it makes that whole thing very complicated.
2144200	2153880	Uh, so yeah, uh, we got the, uh, Skyrim looking game from Obsidian avowed, uh, trailer for
2153880	2154880	that.
2154880	2155880	That looks pretty awesome.
2155880	2160040	It's, it's going to be, it's going to, you know, scratch my elder scrolls itch until
2160040	2161400	there's drill six comes out.
2161400	2166240	Well, I guess Starfield do that too, but here's, here's, here's the thing about avowed and
2166240	2168940	a lot of games, frankly, that I saw at the Xbox event.
2168940	2174000	And I find like I'm always walking out of these Xbox events thinking this avowed was
2174000	2177600	something where I was like, okay, I don't, I'd have to see more on this.
2177600	2181520	Like in the traditional, how I evaluate game sense, I would usually go, okay, I need to
2181520	2182880	see more about this.
2182880	2186560	I need to do is deep dive to know if this is worth spending 70 bucks on.
2186560	2188280	Like I need to know more about this.
2188280	2189280	I see more game play.
2189520	2194240	I need to get maybe some sense from some critics I trust or some friends, like if this is going
2194240	2195240	to be worth 70 bucks.
2195240	2199400	But the thing about the Xbox events, I get to measure it to different criteria because
2199400	2202320	I go, oh cool, this is on game pass.
2202320	2205720	This just validates me hanging onto my subscription and yeah, hell yeah, I'm going to download
2205720	2207600	this day one and check it out.
2207600	2214720	Like it really changes the criteria of how I approach a lot of games that are shown like,
2214720	2218200	and again, sorry not to be a bitch, but like payday three didn't even look like it was
2218200	2219600	worth the bandwidth.
2219600	2220600	Sorry about it.
2220600	2221840	But, but you know what?
2221840	2226160	Maybe it was for somebody else who could give two shits about avowed and that's okay.
2226160	2230220	That's the beauty about a diverse plate of games that you bring to the table at these
2230220	2231600	announcement things.
2231600	2232600	Great.
2232600	2234260	But avowed, I definitely was like, okay, cool.
2234260	2235260	That's going to be on game pass.
2235260	2236260	Fuck you.
2236260	2237260	I'll check it out.
2237260	2238260	Cool.
2238260	2241240	And I feel like as long as I'm walking away feeling like that from an Xbox thing, it's
2241240	2242240	a win.
2242240	2243240	That's true.
2243240	2244240	Yeah.
2244240	2245240	Yeah.
2245280	2248400	I mean, there's like, like you said, there's something for everybody.
2248400	2255160	So for example, people that play payday three may not be fans of, you know, a secret of
2255160	2256400	monkey Island.
2256400	2260800	So now we have the sea of thieves teaming up with the secret of monkey Island, do some
2260800	2266680	sort of a new storyline thing that makes it sound way more interesting than the sea of
2266680	2267680	thieves.
2267680	2268680	That's for sure.
2268680	2270080	That's a huge collab.
2270080	2271240	That's a huge collab.
2271240	2273240	Is it interesting enough for me to play it?
2273240	2276360	I don't know, but it looks cool.
2276360	2280280	I love me some, you know, a secret of monkey Island.
2280280	2281280	I was getting pretty excited there.
2281280	2285320	Then I saw a sea of thieves and I got less excited, but it was still neat to see.
2285320	2290520	Well, I think again, because this is all game pass, I think one thing that Microsoft slash
2290520	2296080	rare could do that would be very smart would be to put out some type of campaign or something
2296080	2302680	or an event or do some marketing behind look, if you've missed sea of thieves all this time,
2302680	2308200	here's how to catch up and feel like you're with it to do this monkey Island stuff like
2308200	2309200	a little.
2309200	2311800	And I'm sure they've got to be thinking this in the back of their mind.
2311800	2314960	Like how do we catch people up who have never played this game, who are suddenly interested
2314960	2319560	in it because of the Lucas arts collab, I think if they can kind of bring that a little
2319560	2323560	bit more to the forefront of mind, I think that'll be a win for them.
2323560	2327480	I think they could win me over if they could convince me that I could catch up relatively
2327480	2331820	easy and be able to jump into this monkey Island stuff without feeling like I'm seven
2331820	2334060	years behind on sea of thieves.
2334060	2337500	Yeah, yeah.
2337500	2342420	Then we got a trailer for what I thought was a flight sim update originally, but then it
2342420	2345100	ends up being a whole new flight sim game.
2345100	2350940	So what's going to be unique about flight sim 2024 is now they have a bunch of different
2350940	2353540	jobs that you can do in the game.
2353540	2358580	So like if you want to try your hand at you know, aerial firefighting, you can do that
2358580	2366060	or cargo transport or rescue or, you know, all sorts of crazy stuff with that, which
2366060	2370660	was really cool because kind of taking flight sim in a completely different direction with
2370660	2371660	that stuff.
2371660	2374460	So I'm definitely interested in hearing more about that.
2374460	2377060	Yeah, I was a little surprised it wasn't an expansion.
2377060	2378600	I thought that's where it was going at first.
2378600	2382780	But then of course, again, going back to the game pass thing I just laid out, like does
2382780	2383780	it matter?
2383780	2386060	Because as long as you have game pass, you're going to get it anyway.
2386060	2389620	And I will say again, flight sim is an excellent example of a game.
2389620	2393620	I don't think I could justify dropping $70 on it because I'm terrible at flying the planes
2393620	2394620	and all that.
2394620	2398980	I need that mode where you start it and it like flies the plane for you and then you
2398980	2402240	pick it up midway through like that, because you can do that in some of the adventure modes
2402240	2404280	in the first flight sim.
2404280	2407820	So you know, I like that, but I don't know if it's worth spending $70 on, but again,
2407820	2415300	with game pass, like that flight sim is probably the, yeah, I'm going to say it's the best
2415340	2417940	looking video game out there right now, period.
2417940	2420880	Flight sim is the best looking video game out there right now.
2420880	2423420	It's just a gorgeous, gorgeous game.
2423420	2427620	And all this other stuff they're doing with it just, you know, even kicks that up more
2427620	2432860	where it's like, okay, if just flying a plane is too boring for you, then here's like 20
2432860	2437100	different jobs you could do in the game to give this a little bit more of like something
2437100	2440220	to get you from A to B, for real.
2441220	2448140	Then we had a trailer for, another trailer for Sasua Saga, Hellblade II, and they said
2448140	2451940	that it's wrapped up shooting and it's coming out next year.
2451940	2452940	So that looks interesting.
2452940	2453940	It looks good.
2453940	2454940	Okay.
2454940	2456100	I'm going to say something unpopular about this game.
2456100	2459060	It is time for this game to shit or get off the pot.
2459060	2462080	It is like, I'm sick of the teases for this game.
2462080	2464700	It has been how many years that they've been teasing this game.
2464700	2468260	It's and I realize a good game takes time.
2468260	2474500	I get, but we're getting to that like no man's sky pre-hype, what was the other game
2474500	2482300	they drug out for years and years and years, Cyberpunk, that great example, exactly the
2482300	2484940	worry I'm starting to have for this game.
2484940	2490800	There is such a thing as too much hype and this game is getting dangerously close.
2490800	2496340	The most exciting thing about that entire trailer was a release date for next year.
2496340	2500620	And they, I swear to God, they better not delay it because I cannot take one more year
2500620	2502180	of this game being teased.
2502180	2503900	I'm sure it will be great.
2503900	2505980	Look again, I'm not trying to shit on the game.
2505980	2509300	I'm just saying how much hype is too much hype.
2509300	2514700	We literally have some groundbreaking new trailer for this game every single year and
2514700	2516220	I'm ready for something different.
2516220	2517220	That's all.
2517220	2518220	Yeah.
2518220	2522260	Oh, Death's Draining would have been another one that did that too.
2522260	2523380	Oh, good.
2523380	2524380	Good example.
2524380	2525380	Yeah.
2525420	2529740	I mean, and again, none of those games are, well, maybe Cyberpunk, but now it's in a better
2529740	2531340	state than it was maybe in the beginning.
2531340	2533380	But you know, Death's Draining wasn't particularly bad.
2533380	2538340	No man's sky, again, now it's great, you know, the beginning, you know, again, I'm not trying
2538340	2539940	to crap on the quality of the game.
2539940	2543600	I'm just saying there is such a thing as too much hype and a point where I'm like, I'm
2543600	2545240	sick of hearing about it.
2545240	2547140	And this game is getting there.
2547140	2551380	It's like on the line.
2551380	2553860	So let's see.
2553860	2562100	We also had a trailer for Like a Dragon 8 called Infinite Wealth and it was silly.
2562100	2566340	It's definitely felt like a like a dragon game.
2566340	2571340	It felt like that fucking scene from Austin Powers with all the, yes, that was, that was
2571340	2574540	objects discreetly covering.
2574540	2575540	But you know what?
2575540	2578580	I'm, I'm going to say this, I'm going to say this.
2578580	2584780	I will give kudos to Sega and Microsoft for daring to show Ichiban's ass.
2584780	2585780	I will.
2585780	2586780	You know what?
2586780	2587780	I will.
2587780	2593620	Because how many times do we get to see, you know, cleavage, lady, lady butts and all these?
2593620	2599980	I will, I will give props and on Pride Month nonetheless, I will give Microsoft and Sega
2599980	2604180	their due props for not being afraid to show a butt.
2604180	2605900	It's just a butt.
2605900	2608540	Everybody's going to be talking about it for the next week.
2608540	2609540	But you know what?
2609540	2613500	Y'all, it's, it's, it's, it's just a butt.
2613500	2614500	Yeah.
2614500	2616700	We have another update coming to Fallout 76.
2616700	2618980	They're adding Atlantic City.
2618980	2619980	Cool.
2619980	2622100	I'm still not interested in Fallout 76.
2622100	2627100	I hear it is better than it used to be, but too little too late.
2627100	2628860	Wait, wait, wait.
2628860	2632460	You went by like a dragon too fast because I just wanted to say this, there's been a
2632460	2637380	lot of confusion, but this is officially Yakuza 8 basically, which is now like a dragon
2637380	2638380	is now the main series.
2638380	2643500	This is like a dragon 8 and it is kind of exciting that it is in the, like it's very
2643500	2649500	clearly and literally fish out of water situation, but it sounds like he's going to be in America.
2649500	2651300	I mean, it looked very Santa Monica to me.
2651300	2656060	I mean, some people were saying it was Hawaii maybe, but I thought maybe the abundance of
2656060	2660300	blonde hair, blue eye folks in the scene was supposed to point to like a Santa Monica type
2660300	2661300	of thing.
2661820	2667540	So, but I like the idea of a Yakuza game taking place in America, or at least in part.
2667540	2671420	It doesn't mean the whole thing's there because, you know, and like a dragon, you started in
2671420	2673060	one place, but didn't stay there.
2673060	2674060	Spoiler alert.
2674060	2679260	But again, if even I know that after all this time, you can have that ruined for you.
2679260	2681860	It's not, it's just the prologue anyway.
2681860	2686720	But I think it'll be interesting to see how that goes into America.
2686720	2694800	But yes, I need to see, I need to see that Yakuza like a dragon.
2694800	2695800	I'm sorry.
2695800	2701720	I have, so Orange Right has brought up a clip from the Game Awards 2022 and I have a feeling
2701720	2703600	I know what I said in this clip.
2703600	2704600	I'm sorry.
2704600	2708400	You guys aren't going to be able to hear this, but I think I know what I said in this clip
2708400	2713560	and it sounds like, it sounds like again, Rob Stardamus might've come true.
2713560	2714560	I apologize to my co-host.
2714560	2718880	You're not going to be able to hear this, but I'm going to play it here on the show
2718880	2719880	here.
2719880	2720880	Oops.
2720880	2721880	I'm sorry.
2721880	2722880	Let me do this.
2722880	2725240	So this is a clip of Bobby and I doing the Game Awards in 2022.
2725240	2728000	Thank you Orange Right for digging this up.
2728000	2734720	I will never understand how these game trailers at these events can slice people in half,
2734720	2736720	chop off heads.
2736720	2737920	Okay.
2737920	2739760	It's buffering quite a bit, unfortunately.
2739760	2743400	So let me, I'm going to drop down the quality a little bit just because my poor bandwidth
2743400	2744720	is probably doing a lot right now.
2744720	2749440	I will never understand how these game trailers at these events can slice people in half,
2749440	2753520	chop off heads, but heaven forbid we see a butt.
2753520	2759680	Heaven forbid we see a butt in a trailer.
2759680	2766320	So my, my point is to folks planning for the Game Awards 2023 or 2022, excuse me, leading
2766320	2768800	into 2023, I want to see some butts.
2768800	2770640	It can happen.
2770640	2772640	And then you can slice them in half.
2772640	2776880	That lets you butt first.
2776880	2778160	Ew.
2778160	2780280	Wow.
2780280	2781280	My power.
2781280	2782280	TBH.
2782280	2787760	I mean, my ego is already getting pretty big this year, but how about that?
2787760	2789800	Somebody from Sega was fucking listening to that.
2789800	2790800	How about that?
2790800	2792800	How about that?
2792800	2793800	Vognetwork.com.
2793800	2795440	All right.
2795440	2796440	Anyway.
2796440	2797440	All right.
2797440	2798440	All right.
2799280	2807560	We had a new game shown from Capcom called Path of the Goddess, which is definitely a
2807560	2811240	unique looking game.
2811240	2812240	Let's see what else.
2812240	2814200	Oh, Forza Motorsports coming out this October.
2814200	2817640	It's been a while.
2817640	2819540	Which we kind of knew it was coming, but no.
2819540	2824600	Another game that they've been hyping a little long, but at least it's this holiday finally.
2824600	2827240	And I do love Forza Horizon.
2827240	2831960	I wish I was better at the more sim game than the arcade-y game, but I understand there's
2831960	2835960	a clear difference in the franchise, and this is the one that I enjoy less.
2835960	2839520	But there are some people that enjoy them far more, and it does look beautiful, I'll
2839520	2840520	say that.
2840520	2843520	Again, I know I just said I think Flight Sim is probably the best looking video game out
2843520	2846640	there, but Forza, not bad.
2846640	2847880	Not bad by any means.
2847880	2848880	Looked very good.
2848880	2849880	Yep.
2849880	2850880	What else?
2850880	2851880	Let's see.
2851880	2859120	The Yellow Scrolls Online, they have a new expansion coming out called Necrom, which
2859120	2860320	looked interesting.
2860320	2865000	That's coming out June 20th.
2865000	2867880	So this was funny.
2867880	2873400	So I guess this is a trailer kind of a walk back a little bit of the whole Overwatch 2
2873400	2874400	PvE thing.
2874400	2877400	Oh, boy, was this a 180.
2877400	2878840	Holy smokes.
2878840	2882960	So they had a trailer for that.
2882960	2887720	That's going to be, I guess, starting, it's coming out in August now.
2887720	2889080	So that's interesting.
2889080	2893840	Well, so there's some yes ands with that is that obviously there was this full skill tree
2893840	2898280	system and all this other stuff that they were talking about with Overwatch 2 originally
2898280	2900800	that is not going to be there and that this didn't change.
2900800	2906200	And obviously they couldn't have 180'd on the content that fast, but they clearly 180'd
2906200	2907200	on the messaging.
2907200	2913920	This, by the way, is another reason why as much as I don't like big fish eating big fish
2913920	2919500	in this industry, I absolutely support the Microsoft Activision Blizzard merger is because
2919500	2925560	I feel like Microsoft fixed their fuck up with this and the PvE stuff.
2925560	2930680	I mean, this trailer that they put out was some really good saving face.
2930680	2935240	And a lot of people I know that played Overwatch responded very well to what was in that trailer.
2935280	2937800	And they did show a variety of content.
2937800	2942400	Even I was kind of like, oh, all this is going to be in the game?
2942400	2943400	Okay.
2943400	2945680	Like maybe I do need to reinstall it.
2945680	2947440	Like they even got me.
2947440	2953040	So kudos to Microsoft for helping them to 180 that messaging real quick.
2953040	2957240	But I do think, I don't think the PvE is quite as robust as people were going to be hoping
2957240	2963720	for, but it's just nice to see them acknowledge, highlight and show that there is going to
2963720	2968640	be space for PvE in Overwatch, which was a key component of that trailer.
2968640	2971400	So yeah, good for them.
2971400	2976680	Mike Defton chat says they're finally releasing Overwatch 2 and it's just J100Matt says this.
2976680	2977680	Yeah.
2977680	2981920	Again, why I think the Microsoft merger is honestly good news.
2981920	2986360	Also, I just want to backtrack and read a couple of comments on that Capcom title.
2986360	2989600	Dr. C said, disappointed that it wasn't on Amusha.
2989600	2993320	It looked like it thematically and quest buster says, I thought so too.
2993320	2994320	Yeah.
2994320	2995320	Yeah.
2995320	2996320	I did kind of look that for a minute.
2996320	2997320	So.
2997320	2998320	Okay.
2998320	3002800	Persona mastery is coming November 17th.
3002800	3004680	So got a trailer for that.
3004680	3013520	Lots of like Atlas games being shown for sure because we also got metaphor re Fantasio,
3013520	3016040	which is a brand new RPG from Atlas as well.
3016040	3017040	They showed that.
3017040	3020440	I felt like there were more Japanese developed games in the showcase that we've seen in a
3020440	3021600	very long time.
3021600	3022600	Yeah.
3022600	3028080	I noticed that quite a bit without them pointing it out, which is also impressive.
3028080	3033200	I felt like there was a much more, you know, for all the lol Microsoft in Japan stuff we
3033200	3038160	usually see there really was a lot of Japanese developed stuff relatively compared to other
3038160	3042720	Xbox shows in this particular showcase without them pointing it out.
3042720	3044160	I just thought that was interesting.
3044160	3045160	Yeah.
3045160	3052120	Then we also got, was it, so they did a trailer for Starfield prior to the Starfield direct,
3052120	3056240	which was obviously the big main thing at after the event was done.
3056240	3065000	But we got a new trailer for that just sent, which is a new game, I guess, by the life
3065000	3067040	of strange developers.
3067040	3074920	And it's like a climbing game, which is it was different, but it looked interesting.
3074920	3081960	Another one, which is also kind of a crazy looking was Still Wakes the Deep, which was
3081960	3086000	like a horror game almost taking place on it, like an oil rig.
3086000	3087520	Was that the one from the Chinese room?
3087520	3089640	Yeah, it is from the Chinese room.
3089640	3090640	Okay.
3090640	3091640	Yeah.
3091640	3095760	I thought the Chinese room like literally like laid off their entire staff like four
3095760	3097160	or five years ago.
3097160	3099720	Like how are we getting something new from the Chinese room?
3099720	3102400	That's and is it, it's not even going to be the same people.
3102400	3103400	I don't know.
3103840	3107600	The Chinese room made one of my very favorite narrative games ever, which is Everybody's
3107600	3108640	Gone to the Rapture.
3108640	3111440	And that's why when I see their logo, I fucking pay attention.
3111440	3116520	But there's a part of me that's like, well, is it going to be like that?
3116520	3121440	Because like, usually that logo enough would sell me on a game knowing it was the same
3121440	3122440	creative team.
3122440	3126560	But it's like, what maybe the studio head is the same and that's it.
3126560	3128200	So I don't know how to feel about it.
3128200	3131480	I need to see a little more to see if it's a narrative heavy game or what.
3132000	3134800	Oh, and the music, wasn't it?
3134800	3138120	I could be wrong, but I want to say it was the studio head's wife that did the music
3138120	3139120	for that game.
3139120	3140240	Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
3140240	3147160	So if, if that's the case for this game, like again, the music would be awesome.
3147160	3152040	So yeah, just as Joe 100 Matt says 2017, they laid off their staff.
3152040	3155360	That's what I thought because I was I remember thinking at the time, Oh, bummer.
3155360	3156640	I really liked that game.
3156640	3158320	And now we're not going to get anything else from them.
3158320	3161400	And whoops, here we are.
3161400	3162880	So interesting.
3162880	3163880	Yeah.
3163880	3169000	Um, Dungeons of Hinterberg, which was kind of an adventure games.
3169000	3172920	They did like a cel shaded sword fighting adventure game.
3172920	3176080	They have like a hoverboard type thing in there, which looked kind of cool.
3176080	3180120	I'm down for more like adventure games.
3180120	3186600	There was a big deal with Kiana Reeves coming out to talk about the Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom
3186600	3194680	Liberty trailer, which it's content coming out in September.
3194680	3197920	And of course, it also has Idris Elba in it.
3197920	3204520	And I guess you're saving the future president of something, the United States, maybe.
3204520	3208520	So that'll be pretty cool looking.
3208520	3209520	What else?
3209520	3215680	Let's see, Tower Born, which was a game by the creators of the Banner Saga look pretty
3215680	3216680	cool.
3216680	3219760	I really liked that big tower with the windmill thing on top of it.
3219760	3222080	That looked really cool, kind of stylized.
3222080	3226840	And then of course, the one they ended with reminded me the most of Bioshock Infinite,
3226840	3228720	but Clockwork Revolution.
3228720	3234440	It's a time bending steampunk RPG that certainly feels like Bioshock Infinite.
3234440	3238040	Yeah, I thought it was a Bioshock announcement at first too, but then I was like, this isn't
3238040	3239560	really like stylistic.
3239560	3242880	It looks like Infinite, but it doesn't look like it at all.
3242880	3246720	It's the developers that did Wasteland and Arcanium.
3246720	3249640	So it's, I mean, I'm down for it.
3249640	3251120	It looks cool.
3251120	3258060	And then they announced one terabyte black Xbox Series S is coming for $349 in case you
3258060	3265680	wanted an S, but you wanted more space to fit, you know, a few copies of Flight Sim
3265680	3266680	or something like that.
3266680	3267680	Yeah.
3267680	3270440	I want to correct myself minorly on one thing I brought up earlier.
3270440	3274120	So I was talking about Jessica Curry is her name, and she was the composer of Everybody's
3274120	3275200	Gone to the Rapture.
3275200	3282120	And yes, she was the wife of Dan Pinchbeck, who was part of Dear Esther.
3282120	3283200	He made that game.
3283200	3286880	And then they went on to form, I guess, the Chinese Room at that point.
3286880	3290000	But it's also important to point out she wasn't just a composer of Everybody's Gone to the
3290000	3291000	Rapture.
3291000	3292000	She was the director.
3292000	3293000	That's an important clarification.
3293000	3296120	So she had a much bigger hand in that game than just the music.
3296120	3303400	And though nothing about what's happening with her current status with the Chinese Room,
3303400	3309320	because I believe, I'm sorry, I'm trying to do some research live as we're looking at
3309320	3310320	this.
3310320	3315760	It does appear that Pinchbeck still is a creative director for the Chinese Room.
3315760	3320320	And Curry is an independent composer for the studio.
3320320	3322400	So maybe she will be doing the music.
3322400	3323400	Who knows?
3323400	3324400	Could be very interesting.
3324400	3328880	All right, anyway, more to come on that.
3328880	3329880	Yeah.
3329880	3333920	Starfield looks amazing.
3333920	3335160	I hope it doesn't.
3335160	3336160	Please don't suck.
3336160	3339800	I mean, it looks amazing, but please don't suck.
3339800	3343320	It's based off of all the stuff that they talked about.
3343320	3346460	So thousands of different planets you can go on.
3346460	3349040	It's basically like a no man's sky.
3349040	3354000	You can create your own ships, you can have crew on your ships, you can actually go inside.
3354000	3356040	I think that's a little bit different than no man's sky.
3356040	3358720	No, you know what it sounded like to me?
3358720	3362360	The original vision for Mass Effect Andromeda is what it sounded like to me.
3362360	3363360	Remember?
3363360	3366360	Because Andromeda was supposed to be like lots more planets that were supposed to have
3366360	3368560	more generated stuff with RPG elements.
3368560	3372500	And then they kind of had the Frostbite engine wouldn't let them do it basically.
3372500	3376040	So they had to change it into what it was, which they got some flack for doing.
3376040	3379660	So yeah, definitely in hearing about that, I was like, this is basically what Andromeda
3379660	3381380	was supposed to be.
3381380	3382640	This is very interesting to me.
3383120	3386880	I will say, I turned off the Starfield Direct halfway through, but not for the reason you
3386880	3387880	think.
3387880	3390200	I turned it off halfway through because I was convinced.
3390200	3395220	I was like, all right, and you all know, I don't like to overhype things.
3395220	3398240	And so halfway through, I was like, all right, I'm convinced.
3398240	3399400	It's on Game Pass anyway.
3399400	3400400	I'm downloading it.
3400400	3401400	I'll check it out.
3401400	3405140	I don't need to hear every nook and cranny about the game, you know, and why this city
3405140	3406560	is beautiful.
3406560	3410480	And they put 5,000 side quests in there and this is so expansive.
3410960	3412760	At that point, I was like, all right, I've heard enough.
3412760	3413760	I'm fine.
3413760	3414760	Like, stop.
3414760	3415760	I'm buying.
3415760	3416760	It's fine.
3416760	3417760	You're good.
3417760	3418760	So that's why I turned it off.
3418760	3422800	I just was like, hype train has pulled into the station.
3422800	3423880	We're good.
3423880	3426120	So I'll be checking that out for sure when it releases.
3426120	3430120	I'm not going to splurge the money for the five day early release because, you know,
3430120	3434280	they're trying to do extra things to lure you in addition to Game Pass and that stuff.
3434280	3437040	But nah, the Game Pass one is fine for me.
3437040	3442280	If I find it's worth spending extra money on, I'll do it outside of the game.
3442280	3444320	So yeah.
3444320	3448200	Questbuster in chat says, Starfield looks good, but I also zoned out in the middle of
3448200	3450800	the presentation because I already got what I wanted to.
3450800	3451800	I'm fine.
3451800	3452800	Thanks.
3452800	3453800	No, I don't need a membership card.
3453800	3454880	Yeah, exactly that.
3454880	3457600	As Jonathan and Matt says, you don't need to sell me on the timeshare.
3457600	3458600	I'm buying.
3458600	3459600	Yep.
3459600	3460600	Oh, Bobby Blackwolf.
3460600	3461600	Great point.
3461600	3462860	You'll be at Dragon Con during the early release days.
3462860	3465400	That's right, because it releases on September 6.
3465400	3470560	And this game is literally Club 96 because it's releasing on September 6.
3470560	3471560	So exactly.
3471560	3472560	Yeah.
3472560	3473560	I'll be at Dragon Con for early access anyway.
3473560	3475480	That's what I have to worry about with this.
3475480	3481960	So like a game like Skyrim, you can play for like thousands of hours and that's one world.
3481960	3487200	Is this just going to be the game that I end up having to play the rest of my life?
3487200	3493600	I wonder if the, I wonder if the planets are a little more confined.
3493600	3498240	Like there's artificial ways they wall them in or something that they didn't really show.
3498240	3502520	Like mountains you can't scale or something like the, you know, you, you just never have
3502520	3503520	the right equipment to do.
3503520	3504520	I don't know.
3504520	3509920	Again, I'm, you know, maybe I'm saying too much or whatever, but it just seems like maybe
3509920	3510920	there's some ways.
3510920	3514680	Or yeah, if they're just using AI to randomly generate shit all the way to, or machine learning,
3514680	3518640	whatever you want to call it, between things, then okay, so it's a bunch of nothing between
3518640	3521720	all these areas, which could end up being its own problem too.
3521720	3527880	But I, I think it'll be good enough and vast and exploring enough.
3527880	3529800	And do you want to play it the rest of your life?
3529800	3530800	Maybe.
3530800	3531800	Okay.
3531800	3532800	Yeah.
3532800	3535560	Bobby Blackwell says it is procedurally generated with handcrafted elements.
3535560	3537200	So interesting.
3537200	3540800	I mean, it looks, looks interesting.
3540800	3541840	I definitely want to check it out.
3541840	3543620	I mean, yeah.
3543620	3544620	Bring it on.
3544620	3545620	I'm excited.
3545620	3549680	Again, this is one of the things where it's because it's game pass, it's like, okay, yeah,
3549680	3553400	I'll keep my game pass subscription active and I will download this on September 6th.
3553400	3554400	Done.
3554400	3555400	We're good.
3555400	3556940	I don't need to hear anymore.
3556940	3559840	So character creator looked really good too.
3559840	3560840	Yes.
3560840	3562920	Very like tons of things you can do with that.
3562920	3566880	Although our old pal Travis Donovan from a show called Understation Live that was here
3566880	3570520	on VOG for quite some time before it sunsetted, he made a very good point.
3570520	3573400	He said with everything going on, and I'm paraphrasing his tweets, I don't have it in
3573400	3577740	front of me, but he was like, with everything going on, you know, in video games and technology
3577740	3583100	these days, it is so wild that I can't just take a selfie and upload it into the character
3583100	3587520	creator and have it generate something that's basically close enough.
3587520	3589180	They have that in some games.
3589180	3590180	It's just not this one.
3590180	3592620	The Nintendo me thing did that if I remember right.
3592620	3595020	Do you think you could do that with your 3DS?
3595020	3596020	Couldn't you?
3596020	3599380	Well, yeah, yeah, you could, but like NBA 2K, I think does that.
3599380	3601860	Oh yeah, it does.
3601860	3604460	I know NBA 2K does that.
3604460	3608460	There's other games that also have those where you can map things because people put their
3608460	3611600	babies and dogs and all sorts of weird stuff.
3611600	3616660	But yeah, this, the only thing that I saw that's kind of catering to you is that they
3616660	3620780	said that the robot will say your name like they did in Fallout 4.
3620780	3621780	So cool.
3621780	3624500	I mean, I don't know.
3624500	3627180	I don't really need it to, you know, exactly look like me.
3627180	3631220	Well, Rob isn't exactly a hard name either, so maybe I need to give myself a more clever
3631220	3632220	name.
3632220	3634940	I'll name myself after one of the animals like I often do in video games.
3634940	3636020	So I'll go by Mr. Smoosh.
3636020	3640740	So the robot has to call me that or like Nostradamus or something.
3640740	3641740	See?
3641740	3642740	Yeah.
3642740	3646380	All right.
3646380	3647740	Anything else on the Xbox event?
3647740	3652540	No, I mean, that was pretty much the major announcements that they had.
3652540	3653540	How'd you feel?
3653540	3655260	I liked the Starfield controller.
3655260	3656900	I thought that looked pretty cool.
3656900	3657900	I did.
3657900	3659620	I liked that too, actually.
3659620	3660620	Yeah.
3660620	3661740	And they had headphones too.
3662260	3665260	I didn't really get a good look at the headphones.
3665260	3667580	The collector's edition watch.
3667580	3668580	That's neat.
3668580	3670820	Not going to buy it, but that's neat.
3670820	3673460	I mean, that they have a watch.
3673460	3678020	It would have been cooler if it like tied in with the game, like using like a cell phone
3678020	3679020	or something like that.
3679020	3682420	Although it says you can read your notifications and stuff on your cell phone on the watch,
3682420	3684620	which is neat.
3684620	3688420	But yeah, if it like tied into the game or something like that, it would be pretty cool.
3688420	3689420	Neat.
3689420	3690420	All right.
3690420	3692900	Overall, you feel pretty good about that?
3692900	3693900	Yeah, it was positive.
3693900	3694900	Yeah, I thought it was pretty good.
3694900	3701860	I mean, I think the best way, like, what was it, like to quote Skill Up, they said, you
3701860	3707260	know, I judge a presentation like that based off of how many games I'm excited to play.
3707260	3710800	And I think that this had a lot of games I'm excited to play in it.
3710800	3713980	So I would say it's pretty positive in my opinion.
3713980	3714980	Yeah.
3715780	3722580	I think Game Pass changes the way you evaluate a lot of stuff in that showcase.
3722580	3728220	And again, as has been the case for several years now, these showcases are wonderful advertisements
3728220	3729220	for Game Pass.
3729220	3732380	And I feel that that was pretty much the same theme this year.
3732380	3734460	All right.
3734460	3736880	Well, let's move on.
3736880	3740220	And you know, an hour into the show, let's finally talk about our gaming weeks.
3740220	3742940	Hey, we knew it would be that kind of week this week, though, with all the announcements.
3742940	3746620	Let's talk about the types of games we have been playing this week, though, while we anticipate
3746620	3748220	all this other upcoming stuff.
3748220	3751940	I need to step away real quick, but I'll start by throwing it to Jamie and ask, how was your
3751940	3753820	gaming week?
3753820	3757500	It was all right.
3757500	3760220	I played Black Knight 2000.
3760220	3764860	I'm sorry, Black Knight Sword of Rage, which we have now, and it's really awesome.
3764860	3772900	And I played some Turtles and I played some World Cup Soccer for my pinball gaming.
3772900	3776980	And then, of course, I played Dead by Daylight.
3776980	3788860	I've also played Marvel's Midnight Suns, I've played Cult of the Lamb, and I'm actually
3788860	3790020	branching out.
3790020	3794020	I'm trying to look at a couple other things that I just want to play in my downtime.
3794020	3797420	So kind of thinking about starting something new.
3797420	3798420	We'll see.
3798420	3800420	That's it.
3800420	3801420	OK.
3802420	3803820	I played Minecraft.
3803820	3805220	Surprise.
3805220	3807100	It's the same thing.
3807100	3808940	Don't play in stuff.
3808940	3814620	I've designed two of the Robot Master areas because I'm going to try to cram two in one
3814620	3818940	episode, which is ridiculous, but I've got them designed.
3818940	3821820	I've got one I've already started building.
3821820	3824860	The other one will probably finish later this week.
3824860	3828980	I'm hoping to get an episode out in the middle of the week because this is the pace I have
3828980	3834940	to keep in order to finish on time, to finish everything I wanted, because originally the
3834940	3839620	season we were planning on going to the end of the year, but then we decided to change
3839620	3841860	that now so it's not the whole year.
3841860	3847860	And so because I could have scaled down the scope of my projects, but instead I decided
3847860	3851860	to double up on how quickly I get them done.
3851860	3858900	So that's not entirely healthy, but it is what I'm doing and it is coming along.
3858900	3860180	It is pretty fun.
3860180	3866340	So lots of stuff very soon.
3866340	3867340	Lots of builds.
3867340	3869340	Very, very cool.
3869340	3872860	I've been checking in from time to time.
3872860	3873860	Thank you.
3873860	3874860	Appreciate it.
3874860	3878860	And I can tell you that Dan followed you too.
3878860	3881820	Oh, thank you.
3881820	3882820	All right.
3882820	3888940	Well, then I can hop into my gaming week, which was primarily Diablo 4 because I was
3888940	3890220	talking about it a little bit last week.
3890220	3892660	I know, shock and awe.
3892660	3896220	But I've been feeling a lot better this week.
3896220	3897780	I was sick last weekend.
3897780	3900540	If you listen to last week's show, I've been feeling a lot better as the days have gone
3900540	3901540	by.
3901540	3904700	I still have a little bit of residual, but for the most part now it's Alan.
3904700	3905940	Alan finally got sick.
3905940	3908340	He finally caught whatever I had like on Wednesday.
3908340	3914280	I think what ultimately happened, I had strep throat and a sinus cold at the same time.
3914280	3917380	Like legitimately that's what happened because Alan only caught the sinus cold part.
3917380	3919240	He didn't catch the strep throat.
3919240	3920740	So interesting.
3920740	3923180	Well, strep is bacterial.
3923180	3924180	Yeah.
3924180	3927460	So he would have had, I guess.
3927460	3931500	But we knew at a certain point like not to touch each other and sleep in different beds.
3931500	3936100	So like we kind of knew early on said strep, but I think the sinus thing was harder to
3936100	3937100	prevent for whatever reason.
3937100	3939300	It doesn't necessarily help with bacteria.
3939300	3941980	That's more of a viral precaution, but yeah.
3941980	3943380	You know, you do what you can.
3943380	3944380	All right.
3944380	3947980	But anyway, point is I'm feeling a lot better and I was able to really put some hours into
3947980	3951020	Diablo 4 this week and I beat the main campaign.
3951020	3952020	Yay.
3952020	3954220	Um, and uh, I'm in the end game stuff now.
3954220	3955500	I'm only level 50.
3955500	3956940	I kind of timed it really good.
3956940	3961300	I beat the game around level 48 so I've been doing end game stuff up to level 50 and I
3961300	3965900	just before tonight's show, I beat the capstone dungeon to get me into world tier three where
3965900	3967300	some more stuff unlocks.
3967300	3969100	Um, so that's pretty cool.
3969100	3974260	I will say as far as the game itself goes in the story, I was, it's, it's great.
3974260	3977820	Like and you know, I know I've been hyping this game up a lot, but like the story was
3977820	3979660	really well done.
3979660	3980900	It has its faults.
3980900	3983940	There were a couple things about the end of the game that really annoyed the piss out
3983940	3984940	of me.
3984940	3985940	Like narrative wise.
3985940	3991160	Um, I kind of think one of the, all right, I'm gonna watch my words carefully.
3991160	3995560	Not everybody's beaten it yet, so I'm going to just, I'm going to hold my criticisms out
3995560	3997680	of respect for those that are still working their way through.
3997680	4002040	But in six weeks when season one starts, I'm not going to promise the same was straight.
4002040	4005040	So all of you into Diablo better hurry up.
4005040	4009240	Um, but um, I will say those complaints are relatively minor.
4009240	4015280	I do think the good news about the game and the story wise is that Lilith was an incredible
4015280	4021600	antagonist and I'm really pleased that they juggled new characters, obviously cause at
4021600	4026400	the time, you know, this is past, well past Diablo three, they had to incorporate a lot
4026400	4029500	of new characters with some of the classics.
4029500	4034960	But like Diablo himself is not really a main character in this game at all.
4034960	4043000	He's there, he's mentioned, he relates to Lilith, um, because you know, basically Diablo
4043000	4045000	is Lilith's uncle.
4045000	4046000	That's not a spoiler.
4046000	4049120	If you, if you read up on the game, you kind of know how Lilith relates to everything in
4049120	4050960	Diablo lore and so forth.
4050960	4057680	But, but it is very clear Diablo will play into an expansion and it is very clear there
4057680	4064000	will be story expansions and it, because to me they very clearly teased a new class in
4064000	4065000	the game.
4065000	4070520	Like there are NPC, major NPCs that are, I think a class that was in Diablo three that
4070520	4074960	is not Diablo four, uh, which will be very exciting when that shows up.
4074960	4078600	Uh, and uh, yeah, just left it very open ended, but I'm, I'm okay.
4078600	4084680	I mean, like again, I thought the six acts that they gave you were really well done story
4084680	4087640	and uh, very, uh, yeah, very comprehensive.
4087640	4091680	Uh, Questbuster says, I only just started the story a day or two in Diablo four.
4091680	4095220	I spent most of my time just exploring and building my sorceress.
4095220	4096640	The world is so huge.
4096640	4102720	I, yeah, I mean, that's how I started too, but let me give you a friendly piece of advice.
4102720	4105600	Don't overdo it with staying in one zone.
4105600	4109240	It can be a dragon age origins, hinterlands kind of thing.
4109240	4114960	You really need to force yourself to leave the zone once you unlock that second skill
4114960	4115960	point.
4115960	4120600	And my reason for that is the other stuff you unlock by doing more things in the zone
4120600	4123740	are gated behind world tier three.
4123740	4128440	So you're working like the more, the Paragon points and the obols, you can't get those
4128440	4132960	until you're in world tier three, which you can't do until you beat the game.
4133000	4136520	So look, I'm all for side questing and I'm not going to tell you not to side quest.
4136520	4141360	That would be foolish, but I will say you're, you're, you're going to be working towards
4141360	4146640	things you can't even unlock once you get that second skill point in an area.
4146640	4150200	So you get skill point potion upgrade, which is very helpful too.
4150200	4154160	And then another skill point, once you unlock that second skill point, force yourself to
4154160	4155160	move on.
4155160	4156660	You'll be doing yourself a favor.
4156660	4160860	Once you get through the main story, you get a mount towards the end of the story, which
4160860	4162960	helps greatly with the exploration.
4162960	4164460	You'll be thanking yourself.
4164460	4168620	So yeah, I know, I know it goes against everything I want to do in a game normally too, but you
4168620	4170740	really have to force yourself to move on.
4170740	4174340	So all right.
4174340	4176100	Questmaster says you can get Paragon points.
4176100	4178820	They just take a super long time because I'm still on tier two.
4178820	4184400	Yes, but you can actually get a four Paragon point bonus for getting a certain reputation
4184400	4185400	in the zone.
4185400	4187480	That's very high, but only on world tier three.
4187480	4194680	So all right, Pop Culture says I'm playing on Black Wolf mode and I'm still struggling.
4194680	4197360	Make sure you are evaluating your gear.
4197360	4202100	Don't be afraid to do some upgrades, especially on your weapon.
4202100	4206600	And remember death really doesn't have a penalty outside of durability, which is a nothing
4206600	4207600	factor anyway.
4207600	4211020	You get the gold to make up for that by killing one pack of mobs.
4211020	4213440	So take it at your own pace.
4213440	4214440	It's fine.
4214440	4215840	I beat the game on world tier one.
4215840	4219440	I didn't move to world tier two until I beat the game.
4219440	4223380	So you are, and I got to like 48 with all the side quests I did.
4223380	4227980	So don't feel like you're going to get a subpar experience just because you're not able to
4227980	4230260	go past world tier one for whatever reason.
4230260	4233280	So but yeah, Diablo four, I think it's great.
4233280	4236560	I can't wait to experience more of the end game and playing with friends too, because
4236560	4239780	I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, all right, I'm sick of doing all these dungeons
4239780	4240780	by myself.
4240780	4244300	I want to do team up and do some of this harder stuff would be a little more fun.
4244300	4246820	So hoping to do some of that in the next week.
4246820	4247820	All right.
4247820	4248820	That was my gaming week.
4248820	4252620	I mean, I played a little 14, a little dead by daylight, but let's be real.
4252620	4254100	Most of it was Diablo four.
4254100	4255140	All right.
4255140	4259860	Let's go on to some more gaming news, more expos.
4259860	4263420	But this, you know what, Loki, I felt like, I felt like this one didn't, this one didn't
4263420	4265500	deserve a headline spot tonight.
4265500	4268100	Well, it's, it's, it's, it never does.
4268100	4273420	It's the PC gaming show and it's usually pretty lame as it is.
4273420	4278700	But they tried to go the whole, and this is where like I fault them, especially because
4278700	4284100	they tried to go the Devolver digital route and they failed horribly at it.
4284100	4286820	Like it was just cringy.
4286820	4289500	The hosts were very cringy.
4289500	4290500	Please don't do that.
4290500	4291500	Just show the trailers.
4291500	4292500	That's all you got to do.
4292500	4294060	You don't even have to have the hosts.
4294060	4297980	They don't serve any purpose other than wasting everybody's time.
4297980	4299940	But there's lots of different things that they did show.
4299940	4306420	I'm going to try to go down through some of these that I recognize that look pretty cool.
4306420	4310840	So let's see, and this is based off of like when it's actually going to be released here.
4310840	4316120	So we had a vampire survivors update 1.5 is coming out actually tomorrow.
4316120	4318180	So that looked pretty cool.
4318180	4322500	Teardown is getting a creative mode, which teardown, if you're not familiar, is that
4322500	4327460	voxel kind of heist game, but now you can build with voxels and stuff and do crazy things
4327460	4328460	with them.
4328460	4330780	So that looked pretty cool.
4330780	4333700	A game called Miasma Chronicles.
4333700	4337180	That's going to be coming out on the 20th and it looked pretty sweet.
4337180	4342220	Parked Beyond, that Bandai Namco game, it's a park sim that's going to be coming out here
4342220	4343220	this week.
4343220	4346900	What other cool things, 3DXX.
4346900	4347900	I get it.
4347900	4352760	3DXX is supposed to be kind of like a Mega Man game, but those those main characters
4352760	4355500	are like goddamn like wish.com Mega Man.
4355500	4359980	I mean, like it's it's a little too close for my comfort, to be honest.
4359980	4360980	I didn't.
4360980	4362920	Is this a sequel to 20 XCX?
4362920	4363920	I think it is.
4363920	4364920	Yes.
4364920	4368640	So that's coming out in August 9th.
4368640	4373700	Path of Exile 2, the showcase July 28th for that.
4373700	4379940	There's a lot of what was the other one here that in vector rhythm galaxy, I think would
4379940	4384840	be one you want to check out a new rhythm game that's coming out July 14th.
4384840	4386600	That's the Avicii one.
4386600	4387600	But now with.
4387600	4388600	Yes.
4388600	4389600	Yeah.
4389600	4393380	With just a rotation of electro songs at this point.
4393380	4394380	Yeah.
4394380	4395380	Yeah.
4395380	4396380	That Avicii game was pretty good, actually.
4396380	4397380	It was a good tribute.
4397380	4398380	Yeah.
4398380	4403820	We had a Frostpunk 2 announced, so it's coming out next year.
4403820	4405660	Parcel Court looked pretty sweet.
4405660	4410300	It's a you're a bike courier and it's like lots of like jumping off walls and stuff like
4410300	4411300	that, which is cool.
4411800	4419880	Mullet Magic, which is a 90s anime like roguelike game that's kind of a one of those retro FPS
4419880	4425280	games done like the style of Duke Nukem or something like that, that's going to be coming
4425280	4426280	out at some point.
4426280	4428680	It looked pretty sweet.
4428680	4433940	XO one, the developers that made that kind of I don't know what you kind of call it.
4433940	4440400	It's more of like a planetary exploration, kind of like a it's not an action game, but
4440400	4445460	it's like a you traverse like different planet landscapes and now they have XO Rally Championship
4445460	4449380	where you're in this kind of buggy that you have to control kind of through those same
4449380	4452200	type of landscapes, but looks a little bit more challenging.
4452200	4455980	So that's something that got announced as well.
4455980	4463920	There was one that I saw that looked just like Animal Crossing Critter Cove was an Animal
4463920	4467860	Crossing type game that's going to be coming out here at some point.
4467860	4469900	Mariachi Legends looked pretty sweet.
4469900	4478600	It's kind of a almost like Spanish mythos like Metroidvania type game.
4478600	4480540	So that looked pretty cool.
4480540	4488980	Stampede Racing Royale is the horrible amalgamation of a battle royale game and Mario Kart, and
4488980	4493600	it looked like too many players on like a track at the same time, but it's your usual
4493600	4495920	like kart game.
4495920	4498000	The Invincible looked pretty cool.
4498000	4500060	I'm trying to see what else.
4500060	4503060	Lords of the Fallen, I think, is being remade.
4503060	4507980	Oh, yeah, somebody somebody showed me a clip of that.
4507980	4508980	Yeah, they are.
4508980	4514900	It's like a it's not really a remake, but it's like a re reinterpretation or something.
4514900	4515900	Yeah, I guess.
4515900	4518820	Yeah, I don't even know if I called it that, but yeah.
4518820	4524620	Sand, which is a kind of like a steampunk game set in deserts, looked pretty cool.
4524680	4530160	They they they teased it before the like event, they're like, the full trailer is coming during
4530160	4531160	this.
4531160	4537320	They kept it to the end and the trailer was just like 30 seconds of like a cinematic.
4537320	4543240	It showed nothing of what the game is about, and it's it just sucked the whole the whole
4543240	4544240	thing sucks.
4544240	4545240	Okay.
4545240	4546240	Like the games are cool.
4546240	4547240	Yeah.
4547240	4548240	That's like some games.
4548240	4549240	Yeah, the games are awesome.
4549240	4554340	But like, oh, another one, Dwarf is another game that they showed that reminded me of
4554340	4558080	old school Command and Conquer, which I am totally down for.
4558080	4559280	So that looked cool.
4559280	4565800	And then the most random thing ever, another Castlevania or Metroidvania style game starring
4565800	4569720	Ebenezer Scrooge and Ebenezer and the Invisible World.
4569720	4571120	Okay, sure.
4571120	4575560	This is what happens when classics go into the public domain.
4575560	4576560	Sure.
4576560	4577560	Why not?
4577560	4580920	I mean, every let everybody have a Metroidvania game.
4580920	4581920	That's fine.
4581920	4582920	Yeah.
4582920	4583920	But yeah, lots.
4584500	4588540	You know what, though, I it's it's quirky enough to sound actually kind of interesting,
4588540	4589540	to be honest.
4589540	4590740	Yeah, it's all right.
4590740	4595620	They showed off a lot of different trailers for like, Hello Neighbor, there's so many
4595620	4599420	Hello Neighbors spin offs now, like I can't keep track of all of them.
4599420	4601900	I know one of them was like Hello Engineer.
4601900	4606620	And then they have like, I don't even know they have like several Hello Neighbor games.
4606620	4611500	Oh, and then another one that I remembered was My Friendly Neighborhood, which is, you
4611500	4615400	know, you've got your FNAF, which is a take on, you know, of course, Chuck E. Cheese and
4615400	4617880	stuff like that, you know, Showtime Pizza.
4617880	4623540	Well, now you have your, well, let's make a FNAF type game, but it's with Sesame Street.
4623540	4626060	And so that's what My Friendly Neighborhood is.
4626060	4627280	You're fighting off Muppets.
4627280	4628280	Oh, no.
4628280	4630600	Are Bert and Ernie in it?
4630600	4637720	Uh, they're, you know, legally distinct Bert and Ernie are in it.
4637720	4638720	Okay, okay.
4638720	4643180	Kurt and Mernie.
4643180	4647060	Kurt and, yeah.
4647060	4650440	All right.
4650440	4654020	So it sounds like the PC gaming show just maybe needs to reevaluate the presentation
4654020	4656560	because the game trailers themselves are fine.
4656560	4659340	It's just the presentation of it all is like, they need to do better.
4659340	4664200	I noticed they were partnering with Heka streamers, trying to get the streamers to like co-stream
4664200	4668920	and kind of build the hype that way because I have some influencer friends and like all
4668920	4672640	of them were mysteriously hyping up the PC gaming show.
4672640	4677440	And I was like, y'all don't usually get excited about this kind of stuff.
4677440	4679240	Like I know what's going on.
4679240	4682700	Yeah, it's just, it was just cringe.
4682700	4686020	Like the presenters were cringe, the trailers were good.
4686020	4687580	The presenters were cringe.
4687580	4689580	Just tone it down.
4689580	4692640	Like you're not going to be as funny as Devolver Digital.
4693640	4694640	Get that out of your head.
4694640	4696920	You're just not going to, it's not going to happen.
4696920	4697920	All right.
4697920	4701680	We'll talk about Devolver Digital a little later in the show, but first we have some
4701680	4706720	more stories that don't involve showcases that are going on this week, but we have this
4706720	4707720	to talk about.
4707720	4708720	Oh boy.
4708720	4709720	All right.
4709720	4713400	Get your popcorn because I got something to say about this.
4713400	4718780	So Activision has removed a Call of Duty skin from sale.
4718780	4721640	This skin was for a streamer community.
4721680	4724720	The streamer's name is Nickmercs.
4724720	4729440	I had not heard of this guy until this story came out, although apparently I'd already
4729440	4733520	blocked him on Twitter at some point, so this is clearly not the first thing he's done that
4733520	4735420	made me make a face.
4735420	4737680	What is it that he did?
4737680	4744640	He made a comment on social media in response to a video that was shared by an esports caster,
4744640	4747760	Chris Puckett, and they were in the video.
4747760	4753880	Some pro-LGBTQIA plus demonstrators were being attacked outside of a school in California,
4753880	4758280	and in the caption, Chris Puckett said, Americans are in a sad place right now.
4758280	4761320	Let people love who they love and live your own life.
4761320	4766120	I'm sorry, I'm getting angry just even having to read this.
4766120	4771320	In a reply, Nickmercs said, they should leave little children alone.
4771320	4772560	That's the real issue.
4772560	4781640	And, of course, people went off on Twitter, as you might expect.
4781640	4787060	Even the esports caster that wrote the original tweet put, who is they and what terrible act
4787060	4788520	is everyone afraid of?
4788520	4793960	I think, Hope, the goal of most of them is to reduce child suicides.
4793960	4798640	This is done through acceptance and removing the stigma of feeling being different.
4798640	4801360	As a dad, I'm struggling to see the harm.
4801360	4805000	Gay doesn't equal pedo.
4805000	4806420	Great response by Chris Puckett.
4806420	4807420	Thank you very much.
4807420	4809520	You do not make me angry.
4809520	4816920	Then Nickmercs goes on to stream and doesn't apologize for the tweet, but also denies having
4816920	4820920	anti-LGBT beliefs.
4820920	4824880	I'm not going to play the clip because I'm not going to amplify this guy's views, because
4824880	4830820	as far as I'm concerned, that little fucky comment stands for itself.
4830820	4833540	Not during Pride Month, you son of a bitch.
4833540	4837020	You are not going to make these types of fucking comments during Pride Month.
4837020	4844220	Thank God you lost your sponsorship, because some people don't deserve to be famous.
4844220	4848500	The Kardashians deserve more fame than you do after a comment like that.
4848500	4857940	During Pride Month, I am sick and fucking tired of this gay equals pedophilia connotation.
4857940	4862060	I'll tell you who's molesting kids, and it's not drag queens.
4862060	4863540	You can finish the rest of that sentence.
4863540	4867200	You want to go look on social media and the facts for yourself.
4867200	4870040	It's not drag queens doing it.
4870040	4871500	You can figure out the other half of that.
4871500	4873540	I don't need to spell it out for you.
4873540	4874540	But I'm-
4874540	4878600	Yeah, they have that whole subreddit called Not a Drag Queen that-
4878600	4882260	I am sick and tired of this.
4882260	4889500	Alan, my husband and I just want to live our fucking lives with our cats and go to Target.
4889500	4892900	That is all we want.
4892900	4899020	Not any of this shit about they should leave little children alone.
4899020	4902720	Spoiler alert, I don't even really like kids.
4902720	4904820	We don't plan on having our own.
4904820	4911820	Now before my friends with children get offended, obviously, I like my friends' kids in small
4911860	4912860	doses.
4912860	4914260	Loki, your children are fine.
4914260	4916420	But you know what the great thing about your kids-
4916420	4917420	It's fine.
4917420	4920180	I like my kids in small doses too.
4920180	4921180	That's everybody's kids.
4921180	4922180	Here's the great thing-
4922180	4926060	It was like I would say when I was babysitting Julian, I can give him back what I've done.
4926060	4927060	That is it.
4927060	4928060	That is it.
4928060	4929060	That is the lovely thing.
4929060	4930060	That is it.
4930060	4935740	At some point there comes a day with, okay, this visit was lovely and now I'm going to
4935740	4936740	leave.
4936740	4937740	La la la la la.
4937740	4938740	That is the best part.
4938740	4939740	That's the best part.
4940620	4944700	Now you get to take them.
4944700	4950980	But this fucking viewpoint enrages me.
4950980	4955620	This is not 2023 stuff.
4955620	4959540	This alone should be enough to get a rat out of me.
4959540	4961620	But you know what's happening now?
4961620	4963660	It's going one step further.
4963660	4971220	Now all the pinheads are coming out and supporting this guy.
4971220	4972220	Like Tim the Tap Man.
4972220	4973500	Tim the Tap Man.
4973500	4980560	I swear to God, I read Tim the Tam Tams when I read that at first, who apparently is also
4980560	4985820	a Call of Duty high profile streamer, 5 million YouTube subscribers and a billion views.
4985820	4986820	Called on-
4986820	4988380	Oh, don't we just have Tim Tams instead?
4988380	4989380	How about it?
4989380	4994020	Called on Activision to remove his bundle in support of my friend.
4994020	4996580	Nick Merks has been my friend for years.
4996580	4999420	We went in getting our Call of Duty operations together.
4999420	5003020	It feels wrong for me to have mine and him no longer have his.
5003020	5008060	In support of my friend, please remove the Tim the Tap Man bundle at Call of Duty.
5008060	5015140	And then that 40 year old man who dresses up in a wig on stream that Dr. Disrespect
5015140	5019660	gets on there and dares to go say things like, I'm going to uninstall Call of Duty
5019660	5020660	on stream.
5020660	5021660	Excuse me.
5021660	5022660	Who was-
5022660	5023660	Let's see.
5023660	5024660	Again.
5024660	5025660	What was-
5025660	5026660	I'm sorry.
5026660	5027660	What was the tweet that pissed me off?
5027660	5030340	Nick Merks said they should leave little children alone.
5030340	5031340	What-
5031340	5032340	Remind me.
5032340	5034140	Why was Dr. Disrespect banned from Twitch?
5034140	5036900	He's also banned from YouTube, I think.
5036900	5037900	Oh yeah.
5037900	5044240	He took a camera into a bathroom where underage people were at E3.
5044240	5051640	You dumb fucks are just showing your entire asses and not in the cool Ichiban kind of
5051640	5052640	way.
5052640	5058160	You are just showing why you deserve to have no followers.
5058160	5062640	So as far as I'm concerned, you all can fuck off into the sun.
5062640	5064720	And I hope Activision tells you as much.
5064720	5070380	And to be honest, I have never wanted to play Call of Duty more in my life.
5070380	5072680	You need to give the props where props are due.
5072680	5073920	I understand.
5073920	5078800	We've given Activision a lot of shit on this show over the years and rightfully so.
5078800	5082760	Their CEO is still a master cock monger idiot.
5082760	5084520	I cannot stand him.
5084520	5086800	However, when it's right, it's right.
5086800	5093120	And I will say good job Activision for what you're doing on this and props to you.
5093120	5098040	And honestly, I want to play Call of Duty to support what you're doing.
5098040	5099840	I do.
5100520	5105320	I never thought those words would leave my mouth.
5105320	5112600	But thank you for standing by and say that this language isn't fucking okay.
5112600	5116400	And yeah, if this is the kind of shit that's going to leave your mouth, you deserve to
5116400	5119480	be deplatformed.
5119480	5122320	I don't have a Call of Duty skin on the store.
5122320	5124280	I'm not entitled to it.
5124280	5126460	Neither are you.
5126460	5136940	So if you're going to conduct yourself like a massive twat, then good riddance.
5136940	5140800	Maybe you can start a GoFundMe or something and a bunch of dumb fucks can pay your bills
5140800	5141800	or something.
5141800	5147780	All your scummy little fans that are standing by you through all this.
5147780	5153520	Anyway, Djurama S points out that wasn't why he was removed from Twitch, but it should
5153520	5154520	have been.
5154520	5155520	Yeah, probably.
5155580	5157280	I'm pretty sure he got a temp ban for that.
5157280	5159400	It was all those temp bans that added up.
5159400	5164120	But we're...he's...that guy...
5164120	5172680	Anyway, and if you're following these people, I really need you to evaluate.
5172680	5176340	Because honestly, again, I want to make this very clear.
5176340	5178260	They should leave little children alone.
5178260	5179360	That's the real issue.
5179360	5180640	Who is they?
5180640	5181960	LGBT folks?
5181960	5183400	Because that's me.
5183400	5184760	That's Dark Sakura.
5184760	5189520	That's a lot of people in our audience that listen to this show.
5189520	5197000	You're okay with somebody saying that, insinuating, allowing that conclusion that we want to whatever
5197000	5201200	with kids?
5201200	5203940	You're okay with that?
5203940	5207120	Fuck out of here.
5207120	5208600	I think I threw up in my mouth a little.
5208600	5209600	I did too.
5209600	5214520	And this is...it's the whole thing is, again, if y'all are going to say, stop making stupid
5214520	5218640	people famous when talking about the Kardashians, then you need to mean it here too.
5218640	5222080	Stop making these dumb fucks famous.
5222080	5223080	I was so happy.
5223080	5227580	I mean, I'd heard of Dr. Disrespect, but only because of the other dumb things he's done
5227580	5228580	over the years.
5228580	5233120	But I hadn't heard of the Tam Tam guy or this other guy who I apparently had blocked already
5233120	5239960	on Twitter, probably over something else moronic that he'd said at some point.
5239960	5241240	Not in my gaming community.
5241240	5242240	Get the fuck out.
5242240	5246480	I'm glad Activision showed him the door.
5246480	5251480	Anyway, I don't know what better transition...
5251480	5253360	One thing they did right?
5253360	5256680	Yeah, no, we have to give credit where credit is due.
5256680	5260320	There are a lot of problems at Activision, 100%.
5260320	5262200	This was the right decision.
5262200	5267040	This shows a culture of trying to change and do the right thing.
5267040	5272120	This is movement in the right direction, and it must be called out and it must be backed
5272160	5274920	up and applauded.
5274920	5279520	Anyway, I don't know how else to follow up this story, but I think a serial killer story
5279520	5280520	sounds pretty good.
5280520	5283240	So Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
5283240	5289000	Well, actually, my thing is starting off on the music composer.
5289000	5291480	Oh, sure.
5291480	5298000	How many of y'all listening are familiar with Harry Manfredini?
5298000	5301360	I bet if I played the song, you'd know.
5301600	5306200	Well, we can play it if we won't get, you know...
5306200	5308440	I shouldn't risk it, but you can hum it.
5308440	5309440	All right.
5309440	5313240	Well, no, just think kill, kill, kill, die, die, die.
5313240	5314240	Anyway.
5314240	5316240	There you go.
5316240	5328000	So anyway, so Harry Manfredini is the composer for all the music in the Friday 13th series
5328000	5330760	and the games.
5330760	5338080	And now the game itself, the game that's been out right now, their publisher, Gun Media,
5338080	5342560	announced that their license for Friday the 13th is going to expire and the game won't
5342560	5345920	be for sale after this year.
5345920	5352520	So moving on, while that's been...
5352520	5359920	On one hand, there's already so many other things going like a Peacock TV series, but
5359920	5362120	another video game is in the works.
5362120	5370920	And it was Manfredini who broke it by saying that he was doing the music for it.
5370920	5379120	There was a Crystal Lake reunion event that was in New Jersey and he said that he was
5379120	5384640	working on music for another game that has yet to be officially announced and he can't
5384640	5385960	really say much about it.
5385960	5388280	I think he kind of let that going a bit more.
5388320	5393120	But he did say the new game will feature more realistic looking characters and have different
5393120	5401240	gameplay as compared to the previous asymmetrical experience.
5401240	5414480	So there is a lot more projects involved in the whole Return to Crystal Lake series that's
5414480	5415960	going to be on...
5415960	5419840	Sorry, Crystal Lake series that's going to be on Peacock.
5419840	5426680	But they're apparently going to have a lot more and it looks like the video game doesn't
5426680	5430680	have a release date clearly because all we had was this tease and the TV show doesn't
5430680	5432000	have a release date yet.
5432000	5434160	So we'll have to keep our eyes on it.
5434160	5438000	Well, and now they have to let the old game sunset.
5438000	5442200	I don't know if you heard that this week, but the current asymmetrical game...
5442200	5443920	That's what I said at the beginning of the article.
5443920	5447800	Yeah, it's going to go, phew.
5447800	5450840	But it is interesting because this all lends itself to...
5450840	5454560	I think a lot of people jump to the conclusion that, oh, Jason's going to be in Dead by Daylight
5454560	5459800	because the original asymmetrical game is sunsetting, but not so fast.
5459800	5462960	Well, I mean, why not both anyway?
5462960	5463960	I mean...
5463960	5464960	It could.
5464960	5465960	We could text Chainsaw Massacre.
5465960	5466960	We have Bubba.
5466960	5467960	Yeah.
5467960	5468960	Could happen.
5469960	5475400	Although I really wish Bubba had gone because I hate him and I'm going to hate having to
5475400	5478240	adapt him.
5478240	5482040	I have to think of how to make a non-threatening looking Bubba so that people just feel sorry
5482040	5483440	for me.
5483440	5485920	He has that purple suit thing that's a little silly.
5485920	5488040	I haven't wear the suit in the Lunch Lady wig.
5488040	5490040	There you go.
5490040	5491040	Yeah.
5491040	5493320	But, um, yeah.
5493320	5496600	So I'm, I liked the Friday the 13th game.
5496640	5500920	I think it's a shame what happened with all the legal fuckery with that game, because
5500920	5503920	that game kind of deserved a better ending than it got.
5503920	5508920	And I see in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, SheHulk10 says, good night to
5508920	5510720	the last Friday the 13th game.
5510720	5513680	It is awesome and should make us nervous about what we own digitally.
5513680	5516520	It'll be unplayable December 31st, 2024.
5516520	5517520	Yeah.
5517520	5519760	Kind of sucks that the servers are going to be kaput.
5519760	5524440	But until then, you know, it was a great game for what it was.
5524440	5529120	It's a bummer that the legal issues just caused it to grind to a halt.
5529120	5535560	Speaking of scary games sunsetting on a tangent, I'm sure you heard about this Dark Sakura
5535560	5539080	Video Horse Society or VHS also announced this week.
5539080	5545480	It will be leaving as of, I think, October, September, October.
5545480	5547080	I didn't hear about that.
5547080	5548080	Oh yeah.
5548080	5549080	Yeah.
5549080	5550080	VHS is done.
5550080	5551520	It didn't do well?
5551520	5552520	Yeah.
5552520	5556720	And they did not have the player base basically to substantiate, which is interesting.
5556720	5560200	That game had so much hype and then they pulled it offline.
5560200	5564400	It was the exact same thing that happened to Hive social app.
5564400	5568880	Everybody jumped on it for a couple of weeks and then they pulled it offline for like months
5568880	5569880	and nobody went back.
5569880	5574240	Well, I shouldn't say nobody, but not enough people went back that were there the first
5574240	5575240	time.
5575240	5579760	They just put out a whole bunch of new content and you know, a lot of people loved it.
5579760	5589040	So I'll be honest, I hated the forced voice chat, I mean, but I mean, that's sad.
5589040	5590040	Yeah.
5590040	5593520	So that's another horror, asymmetrical horror game that's biting the dust.
5593520	5595680	Rest of Pepperoni.
5595680	5596680	Yeah.
5596680	5597840	RIP MPs.
5597840	5602040	I think you can still play it like, and they gave out a code to give you a ton of the cosmetics
5602040	5605640	and stuff, but yeah, it's, it's unfortunate.
5605640	5606640	All right.
5606640	5609240	Are they doing a full server shutdown or?
5609240	5610240	Yeah.
5610240	5611240	Full.
5611240	5612240	You won't be able to play it after a certain day.
5612240	5613240	So.
5613240	5615040	Well, then you know that there's going to be private servers popping up.
5615040	5616680	I'm sure they'll figure something out.
5616680	5617680	Yeah.
5617680	5618680	All right.
5618680	5621000	Loki, I promised earlier we could talk a little more about this.
5621000	5622400	You love this company, right?
5622400	5623400	Yeah.
5623400	5624400	Devolver Digital.
5624400	5629020	They had their digital showcase, didn't show off a ton of games, but they had four games
5629020	5632080	that they showed off and they were all pretty good looking.
5632080	5639600	So we had Wizard with a Gun, which is an isometric survival game that's themed around fantasy
5639600	5641560	with the Western.
5641560	5646680	And there's also, you build, you know, construct buildings and collect resources to survive
5646680	5647680	in the game.
5647680	5648680	So that's pretty sweet.
5648680	5650760	It's supposed to be coming out sometime this year.
5650760	5653840	The Talos Principle 2 looks incredible.
5653840	5657560	I haven't played the first one, but I really wanted to play the first one.
5657560	5663720	It's a great first person puzzler, and that's supposed to be coming out here also this year
5663720	5665720	as well.
5665720	5668480	Human Fall Flat 2.
5668480	5669480	Pretty cool looking.
5669480	5671920	It's a third person puzzler game.
5671920	5676120	And then my favorite, Baby Steps.
5676120	5681200	Baby Steps is what they call a literal walking simulator.
5681200	5683280	This is by Bennett Foddy.
5683280	5689000	You may remember them from Getting Over It, a very frustrating game, also a game that
5689000	5691280	they made a while back called QWOP.
5691280	5696760	And well, it is sort of the most annoying fucking game you'll ever play in your life.
5696760	5702760	Imagine a 3D version of QWOP, but it's also an RPG, and that's what you got.
5702760	5704040	And it looks ridiculous.
5704040	5705320	And I love it.
5705320	5711320	And that'll be coming out sometime next year.
5711320	5712320	That's it.
5712360	5713760	All right.
5713760	5714760	Sounds like fun.
5714760	5715760	All right.
5715760	5719560	Moving on to a story that's kind of developing as we went into OLR tonight.
5719560	5723240	I just kind of put a placeholder here because I knew that Square Enix was going live at
5723240	5728440	4 o'clock to do a deeper dive into Final Fantasy 16 and make some big announcements, including
5728440	5731680	a demo was expected to come out of this event.
5731680	5732680	And it did.
5732680	5737960	They did announce that a demo of Final Fantasy 16 will be released tomorrow on PlayStation
5737960	5738960	5.
5738960	5743000	If you want to get real exact, 1 o'clock Pacific, 4 a.m. Eastern this morning is when
5743000	5744600	that'll go live.
5744600	5747680	And this is, they're saying a two hour basically prologue.
5747680	5751040	And then once you beat it, you get like a battle demo that unlocks.
5751040	5755480	So I'm guessing the prologue probably doesn't maybe have a ton of gameplay in it.
5755480	5758840	It might be a lot of cut scenes to set you up for it, I would imagine.
5758840	5762920	But the save data can carry over into the main game.
5762920	5767200	So essentially you can start playing Final Fantasy 16 tomorrow, but just the first couple
5767200	5768200	hours.
5768240	5771320	So I'm very excited about that as somebody who's excited about 16.
5771320	5778080	Also, you know, they obviously did some, you know, other announcements about the game.
5778080	5780760	Some very interesting collaborators on this game.
5780760	5787720	It was announced also the Kingdom Hearts development team helped to develop Final Fantasy 16.
5787720	5793800	And Platinum Games helped to develop a part of Final Fantasy 16.
5793800	5797800	What the fuck is going on with all these teams lending a hand to Final Fantasy 16?
5797800	5799040	I think I know what it is.
5799040	5800040	Any cooks in the kitchen?
5800040	5801840	No, I think I know what it is.
5801840	5802960	Because they talked about this.
5802960	5806920	They said the icon battles in the game in an earlier direct, they said the icon battles
5806920	5812280	would all be very different and unique and take inspiration from other types of games.
5812280	5817480	So I have a feeling Platinum Games probably did one of the icon battles.
5817480	5820560	Kingdom Hearts team probably did one of the icon battles.
5820560	5822840	And that's why it's a part of the game.
5822840	5826520	But that's still pretty neat because that shows that there really is going to be some
5826520	5830120	variety with the game and some of these battles.
5830120	5835280	So I'm very excited to see kind of the credits are going to be like three hours long just
5835280	5838920	to watch the credits are going to be as long as this prologue playable demo.
5838920	5840700	But sounds like it'll be very interesting.
5840700	5844260	So that is out again tonight.
5844260	5846240	Also going with that, there's some merch.
5846240	5851840	If you want to get yourself a Torgal little plushie, that's right, the little dog that
5851840	5857440	you can have in the game that you can pet apparently is going to be a plushie.
5857440	5862320	You can get one for either $39.99 or $120.
5862320	5866240	I'm going to guess one is probably four times bigger than the other as far as the plush
5866240	5867240	sizes.
5867240	5869720	I haven't been able to research all the details on that yet.
5869720	5874080	They're also putting up a little moogle, some jewelry, and they put out a brand new trailer
5874080	5876600	that I haven't watched yet, but it's called the Ascension trailer.
5876600	5882360	So the hype is building up for that game, which releases in 11 days.
5882360	5884200	So busy summer.
5884200	5886500	All right, moving on.
5886500	5889480	More game announcements, Dark Sakura.
5889480	5897320	Well, oh, sorry, I had accidentally closed it.
5897320	5902520	Anyway, we love Kojima, don't we?
5902520	5903520	Do we?
5903520	5904520	No, we do.
5904520	5905520	We do.
5905520	5914200	But at any rate, me as a Mac gamer, I am super, super happy for this, is that the Death Stranding
5914200	5917640	director's cut will be on Mac.
5917640	5919840	I'm so happy.
5919840	5928520	I mean, I was already down to play it, but now I actually will get to play it natively
5928520	5929840	on my Mac.
5929840	5935960	And he's also committed to bringing other future games out on Mac, you know, good triple
5935960	5937680	A titles.
5937680	5941200	And I'm feeling pretty happy about that.
5941200	5949320	Capcom's already on the ball too, with them having released Resident Evil Village on Mac.
5949320	5952360	So we're seeing some good stuff, very happy.
5952360	5958800	There was a quick little footnote out of Worldwide Developers Conference 2.
5958800	5964200	It's really a much bigger deal than I think they made it out to be.
5964200	5967800	It was kind of announced as an asterisk, and this is actually a huge deal.
5967800	5971120	And I'm sorry, I don't know all the details, because again, I'm not a Mac gamer.
5971120	5974800	But my understanding is they released some type of driver, basically, that's supposed
5974800	5979520	to make DirectX stuff, I think that's what it is, a lot easier to kind of run natively
5979520	5980520	on Mac.
5980520	5984600	So long story short, they kind of slipped in updates to game drivers that actually are
5984600	5990200	going to make PC games more likely to run natively on a Mac, basically.
5990200	5995960	So this may not be the last that we see something poured over, which would make Whoopi Goldberg
5995960	5999960	very happy because she's pissed off Diablo 4 isn't on Mac, because Blizzard usually puts
5999960	6002240	their stuff out on Mac, but they didn't put this one out.
6002240	6005920	So maybe this will be the juice that Blizzard needs.
6005920	6006920	I don't know.
6006920	6011960	So how about that headset for $3,500?
6011960	6013360	There's a reason I didn't talk about it tonight.
6013360	6014800	I don't see it as a gaming device.
6014800	6015800	Not yet.
6015800	6016800	Anyway.
6016800	6018800	I mean, it was...
6018800	6019800	If I may.
6019800	6020800	Sure.
6020800	6023960	It's a virtual computer environment.
6023960	6025200	And it was...
6025200	6032160	It is a computer, but you are using screens and keyboard and everything in a tailored
6032160	6034160	virtual environment.
6034160	6038480	And it's the developers conference, like the first iPhone was a little like it took a while
6038480	6041960	for that to catch on to like, I kind of feel like this is one of those things was like,
6041960	6046240	this device isn't for me, but it's for the people that are going to create the big ideas
6046240	6048120	for this environment.
6048120	6051960	And you know, let's see what this looks like five years down the line.
6051960	6057160	I'm really thinking of its potential with accessibility.
6057160	6058800	So I'm pretty...
6058800	6063200	I know I can't afford one, but I'm pretty excited to see where computing goes in the
6063200	6065200	next 10 years.
6065200	6069680	I mean, I understand why they called it what they did, because they can say they invented
6069680	6070680	it.
6070680	6074360	And to be honest, like it's a mixed messaging anyways, because if it's supposed to be like
6074360	6079920	a con for corporations to replace their computers or something like that, but then they're also
6079920	6084080	saying, but you can experience all this stuff with Disney Plus and stuff like that.
6084080	6086920	So it's very mixed messaging what they're trying to do with it.
6086920	6088920	But yeah, the tech's cool.
6088920	6092000	And hopefully it drives other people to make tech just as well.
6092000	6098520	So if nothing else, Apple has extended the life of AR VR with this, you know, like, I
6098520	6103000	think that this is going to be a part of the conversation for a much longer time.
6103000	6107920	I think people like Zuckerberg, who kind of is dismissive of this, because he has to be,
6107920	6110600	you know, it's essentially competition to the meta quest, but secretly, he ought to
6110600	6116480	be thanking them for keeping this at the forefront of people's mind and all this stuff.
6116480	6119400	It's going to cause VR and AR to have more to go with.
6119400	6123800	Because honestly, a lot of what they were talking about sounds similar to like the Hololens
6123800	6127240	thing that I tried that Bobby had like years ago.
6127240	6131800	But it's just the technology is much more refined five years down the line, and it's
6131800	6135200	just going to get more and more refined five years from now.
6135200	6142120	So I got excited watching people using the software that I use for a lot of my video
6142120	6145600	editing and my audio editing, I thought it was pretty neat.
6145600	6146600	Yeah.
6146600	6147600	And you make a good point.
6147600	6152320	It could do some very interesting things for accessibility, which, you know, to be fair,
6152320	6156560	let's talk about Microsoft and connect, even though it didn't, you know, it was a flash
6156560	6161200	in the pan for gaming, we'll say, connect still did a lot for accessibility and its
6161200	6165320	usage in, you know, sterile environments as well and what it can do.
6165320	6170080	And so it'll be interesting to see kind of what this brings to the table for unique environments
6170080	6171080	and things like that.
6171080	6176680	But I just think like, it's just not part of the conversation right now as a mass consumer
6176680	6177880	device.
6177880	6180000	This is a peek at the future.
6180000	6186400	If they ever decide to drop it down like to, you know, $200 someday.
6186400	6189240	I'd say a thousand, drop it down to a thousand, I'm interested.
6189240	6197040	There's no possible way that's going to be anything less than even $1,500 on resell or
6197040	6198040	anything like that.
6198040	6199040	I'm talking like far in the future.
6199040	6205040	I mean, like, what happens, what happens every time Apple announces something, the phone,
6205040	6210360	the watch, that all the other people are going to come out of the woodwork, the Samsungs,
6210360	6215120	they're all going to come out of the woodwork and come out with their cheaper responses.
6215120	6216560	And some people love that stuff.
6216560	6217560	Some people don't.
6217560	6219280	You get the choice as a consumer.
6219280	6223640	So there's just, this is just going to open the door again.
6223640	6232940	The life of ARVR has been given a new, this is a time extent on VR AR and will allow this
6232940	6234040	whole thing to catch on more.
6234040	6239880	Just saying you can finally realize what Pokemon Go should have been or make Ingress even that
6239880	6241620	much better.
6241620	6243820	Can we talk about what Ingress just implemented?
6243820	6247860	Because it's garbage, garbage.
6247860	6249940	It's overclock hacking, but it's fine.
6249940	6254260	It's a point to using the scans, the Pokestop scans and all this stuff.
6254260	6258700	Because all the scans are so terrible, it doesn't work.
6258700	6262300	Like I'll tap the ground to put the cube on the ground to try to hack it.
6262300	6266660	And the cube flies up in the tree because it thinks the tree is the ground.
6266660	6275300	Because it's, anyway, I digress, but that is not the future of AR, that's for sure.
6275300	6279500	I had been thinking about this, something I was talking to another friend about is,
6279500	6285860	and this actually goes back to a documentary I was watching about some surgeons using Bluetooth
6285860	6294740	to connect a, well, a former quadriplegic, he's now just missing the use of his legs,
6294740	6301300	but he was fully paralyzed before, and they're using Bluetooth to connect segments of his
6301300	6307860	upper spinal cord with the lower end to send the signals from the brain using Bluetooth
6307860	6308860	to the lower extremities.
6308860	6315940	And he has to use a pretty hefty brace for it, but he's been able, and the equipment
6315940	6323220	is still pretty hardcore right now, but he was able to walk up a flight of steps by himself
6323220	6324220	using Bluetooth.
6324220	6331220	And if you think about implementing technology like that with a computer like this, someone
6331220	6339080	can actually do any kind of work that someone with full use of their body would be able
6339080	6340080	to do.
6340080	6346100	And I think that just looking at how these technologies can overlap, because, I mean,
6346100	6350220	and again, this is not a VR headset, this is a whole computer.
6350220	6354540	And I think that it would be just really awesome to have those sorts of things out
6354540	6361020	in the medical community so that it can go to benefit people who might need the extra
6361020	6362020	assistance.
6362020	6371180	I mean, there is so much happening right now just in the field of bionics and cybernetics
6371180	6374020	that I'm impressed, I really am.
6374020	6377980	Not the AI stuff, not so much.
6377980	6381420	You have to have a degree of machine learning to advance it.
6381420	6382420	Technology is so fucking rad.
6382420	6386300	I just think of as a diabetic and watching some of the things that my grandma, when she
6386300	6391820	had it, having to monitor her blood sugar so many times a day, but now I see people
6391820	6392820	that are type 1 di...
6392820	6398260	I'm not type 1, so I still have some insulin, I just have to watch what I eat basically.
6398260	6402360	But I look at type 1 diabetic friends and now with the help of constant glucose monitors
6402360	6407820	as well as insulin pumps and phones that kind of bridge between them, you basically have
6408060	6410900	a robotic pancreas is basically what it is now.
6410900	6414580	But technology allows that without you having to draw your blood a million times a day because
6414580	6418940	you have the CGM that does that and then the insulin pump that says, oh, the blood sugar
6418940	6423300	is a certain level, we're going to just automatically get the insulin going and all that stuff.
6423300	6424300	It's amazing.
6424300	6430720	And to tie it back to Apple or whoever doing these types of technologies, it's a pretty
6430720	6436580	not well kept secret that a space that Apple wants to get into with the Apple Watch is
6436580	6439140	blood-free glucose monitoring.
6439140	6442940	And it's a technology that they're working on, they're not there yet, but when they get
6442940	6449420	there, that Apple Watch, let's be real, eventually the technology will get swiped by other companies
6449420	6450420	too.
6450420	6455560	But when Apple does it, that Apple Watch will be transformative.
6455560	6460680	As a diabetic, I can't think of something I want more than something that monitors my
6460680	6463900	blood sugar like that, as long as it's accurate, but they're not going to release something
6463900	6468100	like that until they have approval from the FDA, just like the electrocardiogram thing.
6468100	6469100	Exactly.
6469100	6475180	And that electrocardiogram in the fall detection has actually saved lives of people that I
6475180	6476180	know.
6476180	6486900	So I'm just going to go out there and say that I'm absolutely in awe.
6486900	6487940	Technology is fucking rad.
6487940	6490220	I love living in the future.
6490220	6496300	And the thing is, is that we grew up as this technology grew up.
6496300	6497300	We've been moving.
6497300	6500760	See, people are saying that, oh, it's, you know, millennials, blah, blah, blah.
6500760	6506820	This is going to be the ones, you know, who are keeping the tech industry, you know, the
6506820	6510180	innovations in tech going, but like, no, it's actually us who grew up with it.
6510180	6515500	We've seen where it's been firsthand and we know where it can go firsthand.
6515500	6520120	So yeah, you know, I mean, I'm not, I'm not just
6520120	6525700	counting any other, I hate the whole generational argument, but I am just thinking that we in
6525700	6533460	particular are in this place where we remember going out to play outside and having pixel
6533460	6536420	graphics and computers with cassette tapes.
6536420	6543100	But we also appreciate, you know, our high end systems and our Mac books and, you know,
6543100	6546760	being able to go on a virtual walk and everything.
6546760	6547760	So.
6547760	6548760	All right.
6548760	6550700	Well, let's move on.
6550700	6553940	Let's talk about, let's talk about something else that might need to grow up a little bit
6553940	6556580	in our next story.
6556580	6557580	Yeah.
6557580	6564120	So there was the whole, I guess it was a blog post that was put out by Twitch talking about
6564120	6571300	changes to their ad policy, basically that they wouldn't allow burned in ads to display,
6571300	6574300	you know, video or audio ads and that type of stuff.
6574300	6575880	And then everybody was pissed off about it.
6575880	6582220	So then they said, no, no, no, no, no, you have misinterpreted or then they walked it
6582220	6587380	back even further saying today's branded content policy update was overly broad and it's create
6587380	6589460	confusion and frustration.
6589460	6591080	And we apologize for that.
6591080	6597100	And then I want to say that they added something to that, like that it was just, yeah, we,
6597100	6601940	we do not intend to limit streamer's ability to enter into direct relationships with sponsors.
6601940	6605280	And we understand that this is an important part of how streamers earn revenue.
6605280	6609680	We want to clarify our existing ad policy was intended to prohibit third party ad networks
6609680	6614540	from selling burned in video and display ads on Twitch, which is consistent with other
6614540	6615540	services.
6615540	6621060	We missed the mark with our policy language and we'll rewrite the guidelines to be clear.
6621060	6626700	It's almost as if you consulted with your partners and or affiliates before making these
6626700	6631460	announcements, they might tell you some of this feedback.
6631460	6633160	Yeah.
6633160	6637520	And then it's still in their policy though, that saying that you can't do the burn in
6637520	6641400	ads either, but it'll be interesting to see how they enforce it because YouTube has a
6641400	6643980	similar type of thing, but they don't care.
6643980	6646980	They just allow that to happen for the most part.
6646980	6652520	I think it's when they were talking about like major players, like just selling ads.
6652520	6657540	So imagine if you will, like a stream labs or something like that selling that ad space
6657540	6658540	or something like that.
6658540	6660120	To be fair to Twitch.
6660120	6663260	I understand why they want to be the ones selling ads.
6663260	6667300	Like I get that to an extent, like they don't want, and I think when they clarified the
6667300	6669540	language is that it's an ad network.
6669540	6674180	They don't want a competing, like whoever selling, you know, ads and so forth.
6674180	6680100	But obviously, you know, you look at a summer games done quick, a nonprofit that's bolstered
6680100	6685380	up by having ads and sponsorship on their stream to be able to help fundraise over that.
6685380	6688700	I don't think that's ever what Twitch intended to target, but unfortunately, because they
6688700	6693860	didn't talk to enough people, they inadvertently did, and that's why they had to correct course
6693860	6695400	real quick.
6695400	6700440	As Bobby points out in chat, they made graphics for it.
6700440	6702640	It was not broad or misinterpreted.
6702640	6703640	Yeah.
6703640	6708160	Like this was very well thought out on their end.
6708160	6715640	And as he points out, to a point, they snuck in the no simulcasting to their terms of
6715640	6717020	service as well.
6717020	6719820	Whereas that used to be an affiliate partner contract thing.
6719820	6726760	Now it's blanketed to everybody to which a lot of streamers are like, listen, you know,
6726760	6730980	I can either stream to like these eight platforms or just Twitch.
6730980	6732980	What do you think I'm going to do?
6732980	6737060	I mean, obviously, I'm just going to stream to those other platforms and not Twitch.
6737060	6741480	I personally think I see and I've been to many discussions on this topic over the years
6741480	6746140	and I have yet to be won over that splitting yourself in eight different directions is
6746140	6747580	a good idea.
6747580	6750900	Like you have to focus on one place first.
6750900	6754580	But that's, you know, some people disagree with me fundamentally, and that's fine.
6754580	6758420	I do what I need to do with my brand, y'all do what you need to do with your brands.
6758420	6762140	And that's the beauty of an open market in this space.
6762140	6768600	So I just don't think it's a smart idea to simulcast to that many places anyway, because
6768600	6772320	you can't, you can't monitor that many chat rooms at once by yourself.
6772320	6776620	You can't monitor socials in that many places at once.
6776620	6778780	So I don't know.
6778780	6781060	But anyway, let's see other comments in chat.
6781060	6782060	S.G.O.
6782060	6785360	Hunter Matt says, I find it funny that Twitch made a massive deal with the WWE this week
6785360	6789940	for simulcast type shows and shows with superstars, which would have tons of ads and sponsors
6789940	6793660	and everything that Twitch was going to nix, granted they had a special deal with them,
6793660	6794660	but it's funny.
6794660	6797480	I don't think there's any irony in that at all.
6797480	6799660	The thing is, is that Twitch is making money on it.
6799660	6801260	It was their deal.
6801260	6805060	It's not the people on their platform making their own deal.
6805060	6806700	There's a universe of difference.
6806700	6807700	Yeah.
6807700	6808700	S.G.O.
6808700	6812820	Hunter Matt says, folks, we're running to Kick by BlackWoolz says Kick is owned by CryptoBros.
6812820	6816880	They don't necessarily want to address how people are abused, quote unquote, free speech.
6816880	6822300	That's like Kick just needs to, I need Kick to prove that they're grownups before I'm
6822300	6823780	going to take interest in it.
6823780	6827100	Because right now, when I go to the site, it's casino, casino, casino, it looks, it
6827120	6829320	just looks like a bunch of garbage.
6829320	6831880	That's just, I'm just calling it like it is.
6831880	6837360	For me to believe in Kick, I'm going to need to show that it's run by grownups and a really
6837360	6841720	solid anti-harassment policy would show that it's run by grownups.
6841720	6847760	But if they're going to take the Elon Musk approach to like, then that guy is a child
6847760	6850880	and it is not, then that is showing that it is not being run by grownups.
6851860	6860380	Well, I mean, their whole thing is no control and decentralization, so whatever.
6860380	6862020	I'm not going to go to it.
6862020	6867260	I'm going to keep calling them out until they, you know, if they ever do something about
6867260	6868260	it.
6868260	6871420	But the thing is, is that as long as people can go there and be hateful and get away with
6871420	6877820	it because they're making more money doing it, fuck off, I'll stick with Twitch.
6877820	6882840	At least they've got really good policies for dealing with, they were really like the
6882840	6886440	last round of hate raids that were going out, they're really on the ball with restricting
6886440	6887440	things like that.
6887440	6888440	Right.
6888440	6892480	And it took them a minute to get there, but they're there, you know, so.
6892480	6895720	I'm happily in their research, you know, program.
6895720	6901300	I'm happy to do my bit to make it better, but, you know, the big thing that they need
6901300	6907800	to address is, you know, things like, you know, charity streams.
6907800	6914080	I think if people are going through the built in charity extension, then I think that probably
6914080	6915840	gets around that.
6915840	6920000	I mean, they've got to definitely rephrase that.
6920000	6923380	They're going to have to rewrite part of that agreement.
6923380	6926240	That's just the end of the story.
6926240	6930160	And you also can't charge somebody for something that they didn't pay for to begin with.
6930220	6932220	I'm just going to say that.
6932220	6933220	All right.
6933220	6934220	All right.
6934220	6938420	Like for leaving something they didn't put money in to begin with, I should say.
6938420	6939420	All right.
6939420	6944900	Well, before we get to our classic game of sorts for this week, I want to talk a little
6944900	6948660	bit about because it is June and it was actually Pride weekend here in Sacramento.
6948660	6951860	I didn't go this year, though, with Alan being sick and everything.
6951860	6952940	I didn't go.
6952940	6957340	But I heard the Rebecca Black concert was really fun because that was who the headliner
6957340	6959660	was this year was Rebecca Black.
6960160	6964520	That Friday song is like 10 years old at this point.
6964520	6967520	The last album she put out is legit club hits.
6967520	6969600	It's actually pretty decent.
6969600	6971140	I like Saturday.
6971140	6974280	She came out as, I think, Pam a few years ago.
6974280	6979600	She's part of the community because she's in her late 20s now.
6979600	6983480	Friday was when she was 17 and that was 10 years ago, so she's like 27 now.
6983480	6985880	So she's definitely come a long way.
6985900	6989780	Anyway, but my point is, it is Pride Month and there's a lot of companies that are doing
6989780	6991460	things for Pride Month.
6991460	6995820	To recap, I want to just quickly state some of the things that are going on.
6995820	6997860	Some of these things we have brought up in prior episodes.
6997860	6999180	I just want to make that clear.
6999180	7001500	I am just recapping for Pride Month.
7001500	7003820	What all is going on of a rainbow variety?
7003820	7008900	Blizzard Entertainment has done some Pride updates to Overwatch 2, icons and name cards,
7008900	7017540	and then, of course, they also confirmed Batiste and Pharah as canon in LGBTQIA community.
7017540	7021780	They are also selling Pride-themed merchandise with the proceeds going to the National Center
7021780	7023520	for Transgender Equality.
7023520	7028080	So if you want to get Diablo logo and transgender pride colors, that is something they're selling
7028080	7029080	on the store right now.
7029080	7031840	I know because I'm probably buying one.
7031840	7034240	So that is something they're doing.
7034240	7038680	Crystal Dynamics is running a month-long funding raising initiative for the It Gets Better
7038680	7039680	project.
7039680	7045400	They're going to do a panel for their various studio members in the community on June 28th.
7045400	7051020	And then on June 30th, they're going to partner with Drag Race alumnus Rock M. Sakura, who
7051020	7054260	is very underrated in her run on that show, by the way.
7054260	7055940	She's a very talented queen.
7055940	7058860	She's going to host a charity stream for the It Gets Better project.
7058860	7060620	That's all from Crystal Dynamics.
7060620	7064520	Darkpaw Games doing new EverQuest 2 content.
7064520	7065520	Very cool.
7065520	7067460	You can download that until July 9th.
7067460	7073400	Iron Galaxy will be doing a panel as well on June 15th with their employee resource
7073400	7074400	group.
7074400	7078120	And they're going to participate in the Pride Parade in Chicago on June 25th.
7078120	7083160	Microsoft announced a new partnership with GLAAD that's supposed to help them with their
7083160	7087780	LGBTQIA plus storytelling and games and staffers on Xbox.
7087780	7089280	People like to see the representation.
7089280	7090440	It's great.
7090440	7096080	You can also find some curated game lists for June and onward, including some transgender
7096080	7100460	and non-binary community games collection, as well as an LGBTQIA plus community games
7100460	7101820	collection.
7101820	7105220	They're also promising Pride Month streams and other content.
7105220	7107860	Last week on the show, I remember this got brought up, but just mentioning again, the
7107860	7113260	Queer Games Bundle is available with over 450 games and tabletop games and so forth.
7113260	7118420	That's all on itch.io, but you can get more information as well on Twitter at Queer Game
7118420	7120180	Bundle.
7120180	7123440	Riot Games is doing a Pride Month recognition with their players.
7123440	7128520	You can get new icons, emotes, titles, and other content from over the years returning.
7128520	7130280	That's all free for players.
7130280	7135300	Sega announced they're going to be doing Sega Pride, a charity fundraising event for Kaleidoscope
7135300	7138240	Trust from June 22nd to June 30th.
7138240	7142820	That will be streamed on their official Twitch channel and organization members from Kaleidoscope
7142820	7147420	will be answering questions about their work and the importance of the charity.
7147420	7153600	Tybo will be doing Pride Month events as well, partnering with It Gets Better, Copenhagen
7153600	7158200	Pride, Gay Gaming Pros, and so forth.
7158200	7162520	Twitch is going to feature a collection of LGBTQIA plus streamers on the front page throughout
7162520	7164800	the month, so that's cool.
7164800	7168400	I guess the invite for Dark Soccer and myself got lost in the mail.
7168400	7172640	No, I assume they're inviting partners, which is what they tend to do, so yay to our friends
7172640	7174240	that will be there.
7174240	7181060	Press 2 will be doing donations to the organization Mind Out, and there will also be an interview
7181060	7185740	on Pride being featured in Alba, a wildlife adventure.
7185740	7191060	And Zynga also partnered with It Gets Better and Take Two, and Zynga donated $50,000 to
7191060	7195780	the initiative, which is very cool, and they will also be doing a celebration with interviews
7195780	7199700	and staff of different genders and sexualities, and there will be Pride themed content in
7199700	7204600	their games, zynga.com slash playwithpride, all one word.
7204600	7208040	So you know what?
7208040	7213840	To the streamers before who were running their mouths on Twitter about things they shouldn't
7213840	7220140	be talking about, I just want you to see through all of those various initiatives, you are
7220140	7223740	in the wrong.
7223740	7228760	This rainbow tidal wave is coming, we're here, we're queer, get used to it.
7228820	7229700	Thank you very much.
7230700	7238180	All right, let's travel back to a simpler time when streamers weren't getting big deals
7238180	7239620	like this for in-game content.
7240220	7242420	But once a month, Dark Sakura puts a twist on it.
7242420	7244060	But first, I'm going to run the bumper.
7244060	7260000	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
7260000	7262000	out a classic and tell you about it.
7262000	7265800	It's time for the classic game of the week.
7265800	7270600	But once a month, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game to highlight.
7270600	7273240	What did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?
7273240	7278820	I picked mousetrap, as in the board game mousetrap.
7278820	7279820	It's mechanical.
7279820	7281940	There's things that move, right?
7281940	7283440	No, I love this choice.
7283440	7286200	I fucking love this game.
7286200	7294920	So the original mousetrap board game was first published by Ideal in 1963 for two to four
7294920	7295920	players.
7295920	7300660	And it was one of the first mass produced three dimensional board games.
7300660	7307140	Basically you are building a giant mousetrap in the style of a Rube Goldberg machine.
7307140	7313540	And the point is to trap the opponent's mice.
7313540	7319140	And there's actually, the gameplay has changed over time, even though the playfield has not.
7319140	7326860	So the original premise of it was that, and first of all, this was invented, the concept
7326860	7331660	of it was invented by Marvin Glass and a designer named Gordon Barlow.
7331660	7339380	They were for Marvin Glass and Associates, and they got their patent for it in 1967.
7339380	7347440	The original version of it was supposed to be a game that the players didn't get a lot
7347440	7350780	of choice in, as far as how to play it.
7350780	7357680	Multiple rules, almost no decision making, something that was sort of patterned after
7357680	7363040	Candylander Chutes and Ladders, or originally Stakes and Ladders.
7363040	7368340	You would take turn rolling a die, and to move your little mouse guy across the game
7368340	7378640	board, and you go from the start in a continuous loop at the end, the little path would go.
7378640	7384400	There is a mouse trap that's assembled in the center of the board, and as you land on
7384400	7389760	build spaces, you would add another piece to the mouse trap and build it as you go along.
7389760	7395120	So it's always built in the same order.
7395120	7403060	And then along the end loop are a lot more build spaces, so that if the trap isn't finished,
7403060	7405120	it can be completed.
7405120	7411280	And there's a cheese space that's right underneath where the cage will go, and a turn crank space.
7411280	7419320	So if someone lands on turn crank, when an opponent is on the cheese space, you turn
7419320	7424280	the crank and it launches the machine, and if it works properly, if you weren't missing
7424280	7430040	parts, the cage would fall on the cheese space, and the opponent gets eliminated from the
7430040	7431040	game.
7431040	7437520	The last one winning is the last one who doesn't get caged is the winner.
7437520	7447360	So the game was redesigned, the board was, in 1975 with adding cheese pieces that could
7447360	7452600	allow you to push opponents into the trap space.
7452600	7457200	You would get these tokens, and if the trap is vacant, when you land on turn crank, you
7457200	7463400	use the token to roll a die to move an opponent.
7463400	7468480	Modified version in the UK had three mouse traps, the special trigger that would work
7468480	7477160	at random, and a different board game, different components, and instead of the model bathtub,
7477160	7484080	they had a model toilet that would trigger everything.
7484080	7488880	And then of course, there were other versions of it, there was one from Elephant and Friends
7488880	7497040	in 2014, you had a barrel instead of a dice, and all kinds of different changes, but the
7497040	7499920	trap is built before the start of the game.
7499920	7505840	In 2010, Classic Mouse Trap was re-released, it had some major changes.
7505840	7510840	The object this time was to collect six cheese pieces, and instead of being eliminated from
7510840	7515800	the game when you're caught in the trap, you had to forfeit a piece of cheese to the
7515800	7518400	opponent who traps you.
7518400	7522440	And then of course the trap was modified so that you don't use a crank, you just press
7522440	7523440	a lever.
7523440	7527520	It's got a plastic stop sign on it.
7527520	7533880	Now a little bit more about the history of the game.
7533880	7543000	Firstly, Marvin Glass did state that he was greatly influenced by Rube Goldberg's illustrations,
7543000	7547120	but they didn't want to pay the licensing or royalty fees.
7547120	7552320	He also did two other games that were based on Goldberg designs, one called Crazy Clock
7552320	7560640	Game in 1964, and Fish Bait Game in 1965, neither credit Goldberg.
7560640	7565240	Which would have opened the door for Goldberg to have pursued legal action, but at the time
7565240	7571360	he was really old and close to retirement, and he decided not to take the legal action
7571360	7576960	because as it said, inspiration and ideas are not intellectual property that can be
7576960	7580320	protected by a copyright, trademark, or patent.
7580320	7585720	What he did, however, was he sold the licensing right for his drawings to another company
7585720	7595680	called Model Products so that the royalties would go to someone else.
7595680	7601160	So that Glass could never get them.
7601160	7607000	And really both of those games are other, like I said, Rube Goldberg-esque machines.
7607000	7619880	One of them is that you have to operate the machine and whoever is the first one to succeed
7619880	7623720	with the installation is the winner, and then the Fish Bait Game is that you are fishermen
7623720	7629040	who have to catch a man eating fish.
7629040	7636560	As far as legacies go, in 1990, Mouse Trap was adapted into a board game as part of a
7636560	7643760	British children's show called Motormouth, and the contestants took the place of the
7643760	7647000	mice in the life-size board game.
7647000	7652880	And then there is the thing that I think I told you about earlier, Rob.
7652880	7662520	Mark Perez of San Francisco formed a ginormous, giant, what he calls life-size mousetrap.
7662520	7672000	It is 16 pieces, 500,000-pound interactive connective sculpture that's set up on a 6,500-square-foot
7672000	7680400	game board, and it has a little vaudeville-style show and a music score by a one-woman band
7680400	7682640	named Esmeralda Strange.
7682640	7689040	You have sexy mice, can-can dancers, clown workers, acrobats, and other scenes that are
7689040	7693760	dedicated to the game.
7693760	7704520	It gets traveled and assembled by 25 tons of cranes and equipment in a semi-truck.
7704520	7709800	The ball bearing, they use a bowling ball instead, and it ends with the destruction
7709800	7713000	of an automobile by dropping a safe on it.
7713000	7717480	They drop in a literal old-style bank safe on a car.
7717480	7718480	That's awesome.
7718480	7719720	It's very rewarding.
7719720	7722040	You can't actually play it.
7722040	7728920	You can't play on it as the ball, but you can watch the ball eventually break things.
7728920	7730240	And even Smithsonian Magazine-
7730240	7734720	And yes, I'm trying to show that part of it live here on stream, trying to get to that
7734720	7737000	part where the safe will crash the car.
7737000	7739360	We're almost there.
7739360	7742880	And you see the moving parts on it and everything, that's pretty cool.
7742880	7752440	But Smithsonian Magazine reports that the exhibit's merit teaches physics and simple
7752440	7753440	machines.
7753440	7757920	So, there you go.
7757920	7766760	Mouse trap inspired by Rube Goldberg and inspiring dudes from San Francisco to crash cars with
7766760	7770280	a safe using a bowling ball.
7770280	7776040	There you go.
7776040	7778380	I'm sorry, I've been muted this whole time while I'm talking.
7778380	7779880	There it is, your classic game of the week, mouse trap.
7779880	7783140	Sorry, I was trying to double close all those windows because you had like four different
7783140	7784800	movies playing as B-roll there.
7784800	7791560	But yeah, mouse trap inspiring different arts and all that good stuff.
7791560	7793080	So, great pick.
7793080	7798480	I think a lot of us remember that game from when we were younger, even if we never actually-
7798480	7802200	I think people in chat were saying, I didn't actually play the game, I just like to build
7802200	7803200	the trap.
7803200	7804200	Exactly.
7804200	7812400	I did post an image in the chat and I wish I had a way to share this with the podcast
7812400	7820920	listeners of a picture from an eBay listing of an original 1963 mouse trap.
7820920	7826600	And it didn't change much into the 80s, I'll tell you that, because that's what my-
7826600	7830760	Yeah, the contraption itself really doesn't look that much different, honestly.
7830760	7834880	I always wanted to call her my cousin, but in reality, she was my aunt who was a year
7834880	7843440	older than me, thanks to my former stepdad marrying a younger woman and having a kid
7843440	7846280	right before I was born.
7846280	7848280	Families are weird, y'all.
7848280	7849280	Yep.
7849280	7850280	All right.
7850320	7852480	Great pick for a not video game.
7852480	7858400	But again, that's kind of the fun is it's like, honestly, it may not be a video game,
7858400	7864160	but I think there's a lot of that creativity and putting things together and I'm certainly
7864160	7871640	not surprised whatsoever to hear Loki, a Minecraft fan and a Sim build fan, a Lego fan, was also
7871640	7872640	a mousetrap fan.
7872640	7877040	I feel like that game was just a building block to all of that stuff.
7877080	7881280	I want them to release like a super mousetrap where it's got even more-
7881280	7883680	What, the safe on a car wasn't enough for you?
7883680	7886680	No, I mean like for a home version.
7886680	7887680	Okay.
7887680	7894440	I mean, I do like the Rube Goldberg machines, the guy with the squirrels.
7894440	7896280	Have you ever watched those videos?
7896280	7897280	Not that one.
7897280	7900000	I mean, I've seen the pictures and, you know.
7900000	7902160	Well, it's not really a machine.
7902160	7906120	It's just he creates this obstacle course for squirrels, but there's like little goals
7906120	7908360	that happen at the end and it's pretty funny.
7908360	7909880	Oh, Mark Rober.
7909880	7910880	Yeah.
7910880	7911880	All right.
7911880	7916720	We're going to talk about some other quick headlines around the industry this week.
7916720	7923200	We're almost to the end of our scheduled stories tonight because we knew that the wrap ups
7923200	7926480	would take a very long time at the top tonight, so we didn't schedule a lot of stories in
7926480	7930600	this half of the show, but we want to touch on a few headlines real quick before we get
7930600	7936120	to our listener roundtable via participate at orangelodgeradio.com, our email and our
7936120	7940320	Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7940320	7941960	But first, Loki, some headlines.
7941960	7946340	Yeah, there's been some updates to Nintendo Switch online.
7946340	7951800	So for June, we're going to be getting some brand new Super Nintendo and Nintendo games.
7951800	7959760	Starting off with, of course, we have looks like Kirby's Tilt and Tumble and Blaster Master
7959760	7960760	Enemy Below.
7960760	7967280	Those are going to be new Game Boy titles and then Harvest Moon on the Super Nintendo
7967280	7971640	and looks like Mystery Tower, which is going to be for the NES.
7971640	7976640	I've never heard of Mystery Tower Harvest Moon is cool.
7976640	7977920	For sure.
7977920	7984220	And then more showcases coming out later this month, so in the very near future tomorrow,
7984220	7986980	we have the Capcom Showcase 2023.
7986980	7991580	It's going to be at 3 p.m. Pacific Time, 6 p.m. Eastern.
7991580	7998220	And they're going to have different announcements available there as well as Ubisoft Forward,
7998220	8002460	which is going to be also tomorrow as well, June 12th.
8002460	8010860	And that is happening early in the morning at 945 Pacific Daylight Time and 645 Eastern
8010860	8011860	Time.
8011860	8012860	So.
8012860	8013860	Cool.
8013860	8020140	Oh, I'm sorry, C.E.S.T., that's not Eastern Time, that would I don't know if that is Central
8020140	8021140	Central.
8021140	8025440	No, that's not something it's several hours later.
8025440	8028900	So that's got to be European time or some C.E.S.T.
8028900	8031740	Oh, I thought you said C.E.S.T.
8031740	8034860	No, not C.E.S.T., I know what C.E.S.T. means.
8034860	8038940	Some of the games are going to be showing off in their avatar frontiers of Pandora.
8038940	8043740	Forgot that they're making an avatar game, Assassin's Creed Mirage, which I mean honestly
8043740	8046940	when I saw the trailer for that, I thought it was Prince of Persia.
8046940	8053280	The Crew Motorfest and an unannounced game, which I think is probably Star Wars since
8053280	8055380	they already show that.
8055380	8056860	So that would be Star Wars there.
8056860	8059340	And then other things will be showing off later on.
8059340	8064100	They're going to have a live stream that covers some more stuff from that.
8064100	8067180	And C.E.S.T. is Central European Summer Time.
8067180	8072380	It is seven hours ahead of Eastern, which would be 10 hours ahead of us.
8072380	8074460	On the West Coast.
8074460	8075460	The more you know.
8075460	8080020	OK, Dark Sakura, how about some other you had some other WWDC stuff?
8080020	8081420	I think it was.
8081420	8082420	I did.
8082420	8088720	And it was really just the winners of the 2023 Apple Design Awards.
8088720	8092420	And I'm only going to I'm not going to necessarily say what they were for, but I just wanted
8092420	8096020	to mention the games in there that won.
8096020	8099340	One of them is Stitched by Lykke Studios out of Thailand.
8099340	8104260	And that's actually pretty fun and very relaxing.
8104260	8115180	There was also Afterplace, which is a pixel game by Evan Kies here in the US.
8115180	8121380	There are crazy spiders on it, I'm just going to say.
8121380	8126260	Another game called Railbound, which no words, no points.
8126260	8129900	You just build tracks.
8129900	8133420	Just a fun little puzzler.
8133420	8139060	And then another one called Ending by Handy Games out of Germany, where you play as a
8139060	8143380	fox trying to escape an environmental disaster.
8143380	8147420	It's very stray-like, but simpler.
8147420	8148420	And then.
8148420	8152340	I'm just seeing if there's any other games on here.
8152340	8155860	Resident Evil Village, of course, also won.
8155860	8158900	Marvel Snap also won.
8158900	8166140	So that one actually got a design layout award.
8166140	8168140	So there you go.
8168140	8169140	Nice.
8169140	8170140	All right.
8170140	8171140	Well, for fans.
8171140	8172140	Oh.
8172140	8175900	Well, and I should point out that some of these games that won were not necessarily
8175900	8177900	in singularly game categories.
8177900	8179900	These were all design.
8179900	8181900	All right.
8181900	8186460	So one game well-designed that I know a lot of you were really enjoying, but you don't
8186460	8190100	have much longer to enjoy it on Game Pass, sadly, because it's going away this month.
8190100	8195020	But for those of you that purchased Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge, you're
8195020	8199180	going to get some expanding DLC that comes out later in 2023.
8199180	8204260	Dimension Shellshock is the DLC that's coming, and they have already announced one of the
8204260	8211160	big characters to this DLC is Usagi Miyamoto from Usagi Yojimbo fame, who is, of course,
8211160	8217680	the rabbit that crossed over in some of the comics with the Ninja Turtles.
8217680	8221680	That's kind of a cool little deep cut that they're bringing over into the game.
8221680	8227600	I used to totally read the Usagi Yojimbo comics back in the day, and he was in the cartoon,
8227600	8230320	the 90s cartoon quite a bit.
8230320	8234740	And as part of this DLC, since it is called Dimension Shellshock, this means there has
8234740	8240280	to be some time-spanning portals that will bring Usagi to modern times, which means there
8240280	8243960	are portals that take the modern times to ancient Japan.
8243960	8247780	Hello, the third movie, Ninja Turtles movie.
8247780	8249040	Maybe it'll be similar in plot.
8249040	8250420	No, I don't know.
8250420	8252640	There is going to be more other playable characters.
8252640	8256760	Usagi is the only one confirmed as of now, but people are certainly guessing on what
8256760	8258080	the others could be.
8258080	8263660	This DLC comes out later this year for the Switch, PS4 and 5, Windows PC, and Xbox One.
8263660	8268360	No price as of yet, but it will come later.
8268360	8270320	So pretty cool.
8270320	8274920	All right, that is our rapid fire news.
8274920	8279680	So let's talk about what games are coming out this week, as if last week wasn't good
8279680	8280680	enough for you.
8280680	8282280	What's coming out this week?
8282280	8283280	Loki will start in the US.
8283280	8285440	Yeah, didn't you get enough games last week?
8285440	8289200	I know, Street Fighter 6 and Diablo 4, you ought to be pretty busy.
8289200	8296120	Yeah, we have a Front Mission 2 remake on Nintendo Switch.
8296120	8302160	We've got Doredogne, I don't know how to pronounce that.
8302160	8303720	That's my best guess.
8303720	8308640	That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and
8308640	8317760	Xbox Series, Blue Protocol on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Daydream Forgotten Sorrow
8317760	8328120	on PC, Birdie Wing Golf Girls Story on Nintendo Switch, Crime Boss Rock-A-City on PlayStation
8328120	8335880	5 and Xbox Series, the game sucks, don't buy it, Jack Gene on Nintendo Switch, Layers of
8335880	8343760	Fear on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Steel Assault on PlayStation 4, PlayStation
8343760	8353400	5, Xbox One and Xbox Series, Formula One 23 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox
8353400	8359640	One, Xbox Series, and last but not least, Park Beyond on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox
8359640	8360640	Series.
8360640	8365680	All right, looking in Japan at what releases are coming out over there.
8365680	8371080	On the Switch this week, we have Hakuyoki, Sweet School Life for the Nintendo Switch.
8371080	8377440	It is in a regular and a limited edition or a special edition, and Kamisama Tokoi Gokoro
8377440	8383120	is out this week as well on the Switch, and the House of the Dead remake is also out on
8383120	8384920	the Switch this week.
8384920	8387480	Those are the releases on the Nintendo Switch.
8387480	8394320	On the PlayStation 5, Railway Empire 2 gets a deluxe edition release on the PlayStation
8394320	8395320	5.
8395320	8400200	I think we have that here on Game Pass actually, but I know train sims are really fun in Japan,
8400200	8401760	so there's that.
8401760	8406120	And then the House of the Dead remake is also available on the PlayStation 5 this week as
8406120	8407120	well.
8407120	8409920	Dark Soccer, how about Europe?
8409920	8414200	I actually have to say something that I bought earlier today after choosing the classic game.
8414200	8415200	Okay.
8415200	8418080	I bought a world's smallest mouse trap.
8418080	8419640	Like a pocket version or something?
8419640	8422080	Yeah, to go with my world's smallest scrabble.
8422080	8424280	Oh, that's kind of cute.
8424280	8425800	These are a whole series of things.
8425800	8426800	Oh, okay.
8427400	8428680	Most of them work.
8428680	8435320	I mean, clearly not the mean microscopic Polaroid camera, but I love them.
8435320	8436880	There's even an operation.
8436880	8437880	There's a few different ones.
8437880	8439880	They're pretty cool.
8439880	8446360	Anyway, as far as what's coming out on the 13th for PlayStation Xbox Switch, we have
8446360	8448800	Power Wash Simulator.
8448800	8453800	On the 15th for PlayStation Switch, we have Galguardian's Demon Purge.
8453800	8460800	On the 16th for, and these both are PlayStation and Xbox, we have Park Beyond and F123.
8460800	8466800	P.S., if someone wants to give me a McLaren F1, please do.
8466800	8468800	I just want one.
8468800	8469800	Please.
8469800	8470800	Thank you.
8470800	8472800	I'm sure one is on its way right now.
8472800	8473800	All right.
8473800	8477800	I've actually driven one around the box, around the block.
8477800	8478800	Fine.
8478800	8480800	It's your turn to have a say.
8480800	8482800	If you want to send us an email, you can do that.
8482800	8484800	Participate at orangesontraday.com.
8484800	8487800	Sadly, I think we are email-less another week.
8487800	8489800	I'll let Jamie confirm that.
8489800	8490800	Mm-hmm.
8490800	8491800	Oh, no, no.
8491800	8492800	We got one last second.
8492800	8493800	Oh, we did.
8493800	8494800	Okay.
8494800	8503800	I think we should just have a voice clip of Cooney from Weird Al's UHF.
8503800	8504800	Uh-huh.
8504800	8505800	Nothing.
8505800	8507800	Absolutely nothing.
8510800	8511800	Hi, all.
8511800	8512800	It's Mishi.
8512800	8514800	I hope you're having a great weekend.
8514800	8516800	Sorry in advance for spelling errors.
8516800	8517800	It's okay.
8517800	8518800	It's more...
8518800	8523800	Anyway, with that being said, my gaming week consisted of Diablo 4, Zelda, Tears of the
8523800	8525800	Kingdom, which I finally got a new PC.
8525800	8529800	I ended up being able to play a game I was putting off simply because my old PC wouldn't
8529800	8530800	run it.
8530800	8532800	The game is called Sunhaven.
8532800	8535800	It's your typical farming game, similar to Stardew Valley, with fantasy elements thrown
8535800	8538800	in, like dragons, fae folk, and the like.
8538800	8542800	It's just a really cozy game if you want something relaxing to play.
8542800	8545800	I'm slowly working on Diablo and Tears of the Kingdom as well.
8545800	8547800	Once again, thanks for the show.
8547800	8548800	Great job, guys.
8548800	8550800	Happy gaming weekend stuffs.
8550800	8551800	Sincerely, Mishi.
8551800	8553800	Aw, thanks for the email, Mishi.
8553800	8554800	Appreciate it.
8554800	8556800	That Sunhaven sounds super cute.
8556800	8559800	I'm all for Stardew Valley but with dragons and fairies.
8559800	8561800	That's very much what we do.
8561800	8565800	Those Stardew Valley games, there's a lot of copycat titles.
8565800	8570800	I'm not using that negatively, but it's just, you know, sometimes when a game does very
8570800	8575800	well you start to see some of the, you know, heavily inspired titles come out.
8575800	8576800	I hadn't heard that one.
8576800	8581800	That one wasn't on my radar, but I'm all for the cozy games, that's for sure.
8581800	8584800	Okay, so talking in the roundtable.
8584800	8587800	We have No One Special 77s in chat tonight.
8587800	8588800	Hello, hello.
8588800	8594800	Who says, who asks, I should say, is there any games coming out between now and quarter
8594800	8597800	and 2024 that you're excited for?
8597800	8598800	Oh, boy.
8598800	8601800	That's a loaded question, to be honest.
8601800	8603800	I mean, for me personally, I've made it no secret.
8603800	8606800	I'm very excited for Final Fantasy XVI.
8606800	8611800	And at the end of the year, I think Starfield I'm pretty hyped for at this point.
8611800	8615800	I think there's enough there that I really am excited to see and want to check out.
8615800	8618800	There's that as well.
8618800	8621800	I feel like Nintendo will probably still announce something.
8621800	8625800	We just don't know yet, but in the coming weeks, they'll announce a holiday game that
8625800	8628800	I'm going to go, yep, I want to get that game.
8628800	8634800	Speaking of Nintendo inspired games, that's Square Enix Splatoon knockoff with the foam.
8634800	8636800	I can't remember the name of it now.
8636800	8637800	That looked cute.
8637800	8640800	And I might be interested in that if that makes this year, but I can't remember if it
8640800	8641800	was this year.
8641800	8642800	Oh, no.
8642800	8644800	He said in the question, quarter one, 2024.
8644800	8648800	So that means Final Fantasy VII Rebirth counts too, because that's supposed to be quarter
8648800	8649800	one of next year.
8649800	8651800	And I'm very hyped about that game as well.
8651800	8656800	So I got a lot of great games to play throughout the year, and I still have a backlog.
8656800	8661800	Like, you know, I have to admit for the first time in a long time, seeing that new Like
8661800	8665800	a Dragon 8 trailer today, I was like, maybe I really do.
8665800	8668800	Maybe Bobby Blackwell has a point when he says I need to go finish Like a Dragon.
8668800	8671800	Like maybe maybe I should go back and bubble that back up.
8671800	8673800	But see, here's the problem.
8673800	8676800	And Bobby's admitted this is a problem for him on his show, too.
8676800	8680800	So now I'm going to have to start from the beginning, because I'm going to feel like
8680800	8684800	I forgot everything that happened at this point and have to start from the beginning.
8684800	8687800	I probably don't have to, but I feel like I have to.
8687800	8691800	So there's just that growing backlog of games to get through.
8691800	8694800	Oh, Bobby points out there's a theater mode, so I could just watch the cut scenes.
8694800	8695800	All right.
8695800	8696800	That's clever.
8696800	8697800	That's clever.
8697800	8698800	I was going to joke.
8698800	8700800	I could watch a speed run.
8700800	8702800	Let's see.
8702800	8703800	Let's see.
8703800	8707800	SJ100Matt says there's so many games coming out, but not enough time to play them.
8707800	8711800	Need a room of spirit and time to get through some of these.
8711800	8712800	For serious.
8712800	8713800	For serious.
8713800	8714800	Oh, God.
8714800	8716800	Now time in a bottle, though, is stuck in my head.
8716800	8720800	Kind of a depressing little song.
8720800	8724800	I'll give I'll give one more shout for our Discord green room if anyone wants to call.
8724800	8727800	But otherwise, let me go to Loki and check in if there's a last minute story tonight.
8727800	8731800	I feel like we hit on most things with the big announcements, but you never know.
8731800	8733800	Yeah, we pretty much hit on most of those things.
8733800	8738800	I would say the only detail that we've got now is Starfield is going to run at 30 FPS
8738800	8742800	locked on consoles, so they're not going to be doing any sort of performance mode.
8742800	8748800	It's 4K on the Series X and 1440p on the Series S.
8748800	8751800	I'm a little surprised to hear they're not trying to push 60 frames.
8751800	8753800	Yeah, at least on the console.
8753800	8756800	Maybe PC, which is probably where I'll be playing it.
8756800	8759800	So that's fine.
8759800	8760800	Yeah.
8760800	8764800	All right, we'll see what comes of that.
8764800	8765800	All right.
8765800	8769800	Well, with that, I think we are not getting any other calls or anything tonight, which
8769800	8770800	is fine.
8770800	8771800	We're at about two and a half hours, which is normal length.
8771800	8774800	So we're going to move to wrap it all up for tonight.
8774800	8778800	But before we do, I'll just say thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch
8778800	8779800	Radio.
8779800	8781800	Thank you for supporting independent podcasting.
8781800	8784800	If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, please help us spread the word.
8784800	8786800	Tell a friend or two about the show.
8786800	8791800	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way as well.
8791800	8795800	I try to keep an eye on Spotify once in a while, too, for the people that actually respond
8795800	8797800	to the, what did you think of this week's show?
8797800	8799800	Because I saw one in the queue there that I pushed up.
8799800	8804800	So if you say nice things, I'll bump up whatever it is you put in there, too, as long as it's
8804800	8806800	somewhat relevant.
8806800	8807800	So thank you to all that.
8807800	8808800	I really appreciate that.
8808800	8810800	And those all go an awful long way.
8810800	8812800	So thank you, thank you.
8812800	8813800	I think that's all I have to say.
8813800	8815800	We'll be back in seven days to do it again.
8815800	8818800	We have some more announcements we're going to be getting at Ubisoft, Capcom, who knows
8818800	8819800	what else this week.
8819800	8822800	Maybe Nintendo will surprise us, but I'm not going to hold my breath.
8822800	8825800	But in the meantime, lots of fun games to still be playing.
8825800	8830800	Ooh, as I transition it to Dark Sakura, I know she has a new Dead by Daylight chapter
8830800	8831800	to play on Tuesday.
8831800	8832800	That's something exciting that's coming.
8832800	8833800	I do.
8833800	8834800	Yeah.
8834800	8841800	And they've already had to do some tweaks to it, but I'm really looking forward to learning
8841800	8844800	the singularity, unlocking.
8844800	8848800	I mean, to be honest, I still don't have my night adept and I haven't played him yet,
8848800	8849800	but I did.
8849800	8859800	I did get both Wesker and Skull Merchant done in four games each.
8859800	8865800	I've seen people calling that new killer Larry because he's the singularity.
8865800	8873800	Actually, Larry is what Shayla calls one of the crows because he's Larry Bird.
8873800	8874800	Okay.
8874800	8877800	But isn't there a streamer named Laurie Bird?
8877800	8881800	I think there is.
8881800	8883800	She actually stopped.
8883800	8884800	Lady Burb.
8884800	8886800	She actually stopped streaming.
8886800	8888800	Oh, I might be thinking of somebody else.
8888800	8891800	But her husband is also Burb.
8891800	8892800	Gotcha.
8892800	8895800	And they call their kid Little Burb.
8895800	8896800	Okay.
8896800	8899800	And then what else am I going to say with that?
8899800	8900800	Oh, the new survivor is very handsome.
8900800	8902800	Very handsome fellow.
8902800	8904800	Oh, Mr. Soma.
8904800	8911800	And there are, from what I can see, I think Felix is getting another shirtless look, or
8911800	8913800	at least open-shirted look.
8913800	8918800	For Pride Month, it's what we deserve.
8918800	8923800	I want an ace character that isn't Ace Visconti.
8923800	8928800	Although, wouldn't that be kind of funny if it was Ace?
8928800	8931800	Our other nickname is Ass Discount.
8931800	8934800	I love the way that Alan plays Ace Visconti.
8934800	8937800	Have you ever played with him on Dead by Daylight?
8937800	8940800	His steam name is Ace Visconti, but gay.
8940800	8944800	And he plays with purple velvet pants and a leopard shirt.
8944800	8950800	It looks like a 70s stereotype of somebody who was in a John Waters movie once.
8950800	8953800	I've seen him do his cosplay before, too.
8953800	8958800	Now, my ace is really gross.
8958800	8969800	He's kind of a lech old man who makes just enough money gambling to keep himself afloat,
8969800	8972800	and he has a thing for college girls.
8972800	8973800	Oh, boy.
8973800	8974800	All right.
8974800	8976800	Well, on that Dead by Daylight fandom note-
8976800	8978800	We have weird headcanons in the game.
8978800	8983800	On that Dead by Daylight fandom note, I know you're off to go play and stream, so any final
8983800	8986800	thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8986800	8990800	I may have open lobbies, and if I don't get anyone to play with me, we may go ahead and
8990800	8992800	try another attempt tonight.
8992800	8993800	All right.
8993800	8996800	But you got to pay a lot for it to be nurse.
8996800	8997800	All right.
8997800	8999800	Well, have a good stream tonight.
8999800	9005800	I was going to say you, too, but probably you're going to Diablo, so bye.
9005800	9006800	Bye.
9006800	9008800	Have a good night.
9008800	9010800	That was a very safe bet she made there.
9010800	9011800	All right.
9011800	9015800	Actually, I have some 14 errors to catch up on, too, so it might end up being that.
9015800	9016800	All right.
9016800	9018800	Loki, what's your final thought for us tonight?
9018800	9022800	I'm excited to go see Randy Feltface tomorrow.
9022800	9023800	Who the hell is that?
9023800	9024800	I've never heard that.
9024800	9027800	He is an Australian puppet comic.
9027800	9028800	Oh, okay.
9028800	9029800	And it's not like-
9029800	9031800	Everything's funnier with puppets.
9031800	9033800	Well, he is a puppet.
9033800	9034800	His character is a puppet.
9034800	9039800	You don't know who actually is voicing him, but he is hilarious, and I can't wait to see him.
9039800	9040800	All right.
9040800	9041800	Good times.
9041800	9042800	Have fun at that.
9042800	9043800	My final thought.
9043800	9045800	Final Fantasy XVI demo tomorrow.
9045800	9046800	Yes, I'll be streaming.
9046800	9050800	I know I've been really bad at streaming, but man, being sick knocked me on my ass for
9050800	9056800	two weeks, so strep throat, it happens, and then another something on top of that.
9056800	9057800	I'm excited to get back into streaming.
9057800	9058800	I'm really excited.
9058800	9061800	I get to play Final Fantasy XVI tomorrow.
9061800	9062800	I'm so excited.
9062800	9063800	That's it.
9063800	9064800	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
9064800	9069800	We'll be back in seven days to talk about XVI, whatever other games, Capcom, Ubisoft,
9069800	9071800	everybody else is set to announce.
9071800	9073800	It's an exciting time in gaming.
9073800	9078800	I hope you all have fun playing games, whether you're playing Diablo IV, Street Fighter VI,
9078800	9082800	or something in your backlog from years ago, whatever it is, or you're just playing Minecraft
9082800	9089800	again like Loki, whatever it is you're playing, have fun, enjoy it, and please be nice to
9089800	9093800	people online, and stop making stupid people famous.
9093800	9095800	Good night, everybody.
9095800	9100800	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
