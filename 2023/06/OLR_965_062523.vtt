Now it's time for your birthday hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki as you've come

00:32.720 --> 00:36.040
to enjoy to tell you about this week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:36.040 --> 00:37.240
every gamer has a voice.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.920
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:41.920 --> 00:50.440
Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice

00:50.920 --> 00:53.480
21 years and counting.

00:53.480 --> 00:59.400
Hello, hello, and hello to all those of you that are participating with our show live over

00:59.400 --> 01:02.280
at Twitch.tv, Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.360
Thank you so much. I see the love coming in as the show is starting and all the birthday

01:06.360 --> 01:07.600
wishes. Thank you all so much.

01:07.600 --> 01:08.640
It does mean the world.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.400
Let me quickly go around and introduce everybody.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.000
Of course, I am Rob Roberts, and I've been here every week, just about.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.880
I mean, give or take some holiday weeks and vacation weeks because people are like, it

01:18.880 --> 01:23.440
doesn't math up. If you do 50 weeks a year, shouldn't you be past episode 1000 by now?

01:23.480 --> 01:29.520
Well, we do more like 45 episodes a year, which is still more than any Netflix show is

01:29.520 --> 01:30.760
going to get, that's for sure.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.880
But it doesn't math up.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.560
Yeah, I just said it doesn't math up.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.080
So anyway.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.000
Hi, I'm Rob Roberts.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.160
And joining me to correct my grammar is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.080
Well, I do it to everybody.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.200
It's equal opportunity.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.520
Fair, fair.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.400
How are you tonight?

01:48.120 --> 01:51.360
Um, it's been a week.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.200
Just a week?

01:54.080 --> 02:00.840
Well, a friend of mine at work that I hadn't seen since before the pandemic died last year

02:00.840 --> 02:07.960
while I was on leave and found out another of my favorite people at work is at home dying

02:07.960 --> 02:09.160
right now from cancer.

02:10.120 --> 02:13.600
So, yeah, it's been a little emotional.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.000
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:15.720 --> 02:16.400
Thank you.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.000
Thank you.

02:17.080 --> 02:21.520
Um, but which was, which was funny.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.680
I was watching like something about aging right before I went into work and found out.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.840
So guys, it's, it's been a week, a week.

02:31.240 --> 02:31.760
Yeah.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.120
You know, you know, I'm resilient.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.120
Yeah.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.840
Turning, you know, in turning 21, not to like totally bring down the mood at the start of

02:38.840 --> 02:42.960
the show, but certainly when you've been doing a show, as long as this, when you're 21 years,

02:43.200 --> 02:47.800
you know, we've had people, you know, you guys that show up here Sunday nights, you're

02:47.800 --> 02:51.840
the extended family of orange lounge rate, or you are the family of orange launch radio.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.200
Now you're basically extended family to us as hosts.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.080
And, uh, you know, we've, we've lost some listeners over the years, like, you know, in,

02:58.080 --> 03:02.320
in somewhat recent memory, a fat ninja DM used to be here, uh, on Sunday nights chatting

03:02.320 --> 03:02.640
with us.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.200
And, you know, we lost him, um, probably about a year, a year and a half ago at this point.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.760
Uh, although it's very hard for me to time these days.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.560
Um, you know, there's been, there's been other folks over the years as well.

03:11.560 --> 03:16.120
So it's always, you know, one of those things where it's like, Oh, uh, those, those reminders

03:16.120 --> 03:20.760
of, um, every day being a gift are, uh, certainly all around us.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.960
So, um, we're, we're thankful that we've been able to be here for 21 years.

03:26.040 --> 03:26.960
That's for sure.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.320
Uh, we've had our health.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.160
There's been ups and downs for sure.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.280
Um, but we've had the ability to be here for 21 years.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.920
And so for that, we're thankful for sure.

03:35.920 --> 03:41.920
Um, um, let me also say hello to and welcome tech master.

03:41.920 --> 03:42.600
Loki.

03:43.120 --> 03:43.520
Hello.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.400
Hi, how are you?

03:45.040 --> 03:45.560
I'm good.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.520
Yeah, I'm full.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.120
What's that?

03:47.120 --> 03:53.600
I ate a bunch of, I'm full because my wife bought, um, like a sashimi grade tuna.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.200
Like, I was like 14.

03:56.280 --> 03:56.720
I don't know.

03:56.720 --> 04:01.520
It was like a thing that was like, it's pretty large and ate all of it with rice.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.440
I was going to go back healthy.

04:05.960 --> 04:11.520
It sounds like you made a poke bowl, but like a Loki poke bowl, which all it needed was bacon.

04:11.520 --> 04:18.600
I like poke bowls and like, and I almost got poke bowl today, but like I didn't because I have tuna at home.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.640
So what we call poke here is not actually poke.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.360
Well, you know what?

04:23.400 --> 04:29.080
I mean, that I know it's missing all of the pocket monsters, but you know what, sushi's close enough, so it's fine.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.560
Or tuna in this case.

04:31.560 --> 04:39.040
I mean, just sounds like you, like, I mean, tuna is really, I mean, fish in general is really good for your joints.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
So, yeah.

04:41.920 --> 04:51.800
Um, so tonight we are taking a look back at 21 years of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it or not, uh, officially as of June 23rd, which was a couple of days ago.

04:52.160 --> 04:55.320
Uh, that was our very first broadcast back in 2002.

04:55.920 --> 05:01.400
Um, and for those that, you know, are new around here, cause we do get new faces, uh, every week, we're thankful for that.

05:01.720 --> 05:11.360
Um, we started because all three of us met as we were playing, um, Dance Dance Revolution would probably be the most notable Bahmani game, which was a series of music-based.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.240
Well, I shouldn't say was cause technically Bahmani games are still going.

05:14.520 --> 05:24.280
There was a lull for a while, but, um, uh, Bahmani games are music-based games, uh, by Konami, uh, who has gone through their own series of changes over the years.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.520
But regardless, we all met playing DDR at the arcade.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.640
And after we would meet up at Roseville Gothland on, what was it?

05:30.640 --> 05:42.800
Tuesday nights, Thursday nights, one of them, we would go from there and we would go to the little cafe that was in the parking lot and we would, uh, just chow down on mozzarella sticks and soup, whatever else they had.

05:42.840 --> 05:52.160
And, uh, just talk about life tangents and a lot of video games and what was happening, not just in the DDR community, but in the rest of the gaming world.

05:52.160 --> 05:57.320
And so, um, on RIP, the mini loaves at, uh, the restaurant.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.280
Oh man, those are the best.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.720
They don't do mini loaves anymore, huh?

06:00.080 --> 06:00.480
No.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.200
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap.

06:02.200 --> 06:09.760
But anyway, um, yeah, uh, you know, we would, we would, uh, uh, eat and, you know, talk and just be there.

06:09.760 --> 06:21.920
So we kind of took that atmosphere and brought it to this virtual environment, you know, that we, you see now and, um, you know, especially since pandemic lockdowns happened, really taking that concept of a virtual table.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.280
And, um, you know, uh, inviting all of you to be here with us.

06:26.280 --> 06:36.600
So, uh, I really, really appreciate, uh, those of you that have turned out, whether it's the first episode or the, um, 965th episode that you're listening to of orange launch radio.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.800
Thank you so much for being here and just being a part of it.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.480
Uh, really appreciate it.

06:40.880 --> 06:50.200
And, um, I also wanted to say a big kudos, uh, that that intro tonight from Jason was very impressive with all the statistics.

06:50.520 --> 06:54.920
Um, I'm assuming some of that had to come off the Wiki or really good memory.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.560
Cause there was stuff in there where I was like, I don't even remember how many of those we've had.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.960
Uh, so that's, that's really, um, really impressive.

07:01.960 --> 07:15.200
And also I just want to take a moment to acknowledge Jason as well, who has been instrumental for this program behind the scenes, um, over the years with our voiceovers, um, the hosting and, you know, keep, keeping the, the wheels turn in and all that stuff.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.760
So just a big kudos to Jason for helping this be afloat for 21 years.

07:19.760 --> 07:22.600
I know you haven't heard him regularly on this show in a while.

07:22.920 --> 07:27.600
He used to come in the studio for a while when it made more, when it clicked more for his personal life to be able to do that.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.640
But, um, just, you know, want to give that big, thank you as well.

07:30.640 --> 07:43.600
I also want to give, um, I'm sure there's a lot of people we could thank and I'm going to forget people, but I also want to give a shout out to Bobby black Wolf because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby black will show.

07:43.840 --> 07:48.440
And Bobby for years and years has joked that he's the opening act to orange launch radio.

07:48.600 --> 07:59.960
I think he knows we don't really see it that way, but, um, we are happy to share the stage with Bobby every week, pretty much for what, like 18 of those 21 years.

08:00.320 --> 08:07.280
Um, so, and maybe not quite that long, but almost, it really feels like that it's been a long, long time, uh, sharing the stage with Bobby.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.040
So we appreciate that.

08:08.040 --> 08:17.960
Bobby is also, you know, there was a time when this show almost ended after four years when life 365, uh, kind of.

08:18.480 --> 08:31.000
Fucked her, I guess life is five is back, but this is the old life is five when you could like run your own network on there and you know, some internet rate things went through and the rates are going to go through the roof and we weren't really going to be able to afford to keep our own station running anymore.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.640
Cause orange radio was not just a show.

08:32.640 --> 08:47.320
It was a station, uh, back in the beginning and, uh, we didn't think we were going to be able to run it anymore, but Bobby was really the one that kind of connected us with, um, all games radio who at the time then became our home network for quite some time.

08:47.360 --> 08:52.920
Um, before then, of course the voice of geeks network about, uh, God, 11 years ago at this point.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.680
So, um, thank you to Bobby.

08:55.680 --> 08:59.680
Who's made, made sure we've always had a stage to do this on.

08:59.960 --> 09:00.720
That's for sure.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.080
So, uh, yeah, and dark to see you talking about life.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.800
365 says they came back, huh?

09:04.800 --> 09:05.080
Yeah.

09:05.080 --> 09:09.640
I remember doing, cause I was like, do they charge you to broadcast on there now?

09:09.680 --> 09:10.040
Yeah.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.040
I think somebody, uh, somebody new bought it.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.760
Like it's changed hands as a lot of websites do.

09:15.760 --> 09:22.160
And I think, I think it tries to be a broadcast in a box type of thing, but it's, you know, here we are on Twitch.

09:22.160 --> 09:29.400
Twitch is the mechanism that we can record the podcast, which this has always been an audio show from the very beginning.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.040
So yes, video is here.

09:31.040 --> 09:35.720
We're happy to see you on Twitch and all that stuff, but it's, it's really an audio show.

09:35.720 --> 09:42.600
This was inspired not by other podcasts because I mean, I'm not trying to sound egotistical.

09:42.600 --> 09:50.000
It's just the fact when there was nobody else out there that when we, when we started doing this type of thing, there were other broadcasters.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.720
There was nothing like what you see today.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.720
That was the medium.

09:53.040 --> 10:02.440
We were influenced by more traditional radio shows and like the three hour programs you might see on Sirius XM or on broadcast radio.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.360
That's where the roots of our show is.

10:04.800 --> 10:12.760
Not like a 30 minute, one hour package, um, you know, that you might see in more traditional, you know, types of formats.

10:12.760 --> 10:17.360
And that's why the show has continued to run essentially as long as we feel it needs to.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.400
I don't know if there's a lot of shows out there that run beyond an hour on a regular basis.

10:23.400 --> 10:29.160
There's some, I'm sure there are, but, um, you know, just, we've been doing it our way and that's how we've made it for 21 years.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.200
So, uh, I'm rambling.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.920
I tend to do that, but I want to take a minute to acknowledge.

10:33.920 --> 10:44.640
Does anybody else, uh, want to, um, oh, one other shout out I should give, actually, I know I'm going to forget people and I'm sorry about that because I didn't plan this out in advance, but I want to make sure I also shout out Travis Donovan.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.960
I know he's not here and he's doing his old thing.

10:46.960 --> 10:58.320
He's being a crabby old man yelling at a cloud, but, and we love him for it, but you know, he was the one that showed me and dark soccer to an extent that literally any idiot can podcast.

10:58.320 --> 11:08.560
And I mean that in the nicest possible way, but you know, I went to college thinking I would want to get into radio and I might want to be actually, then it was TV, a weatherman to do all this stuff.

11:08.800 --> 11:15.120
And then when I actually interned in the industry, uh, I learned that I don't want to, I don't want to do this.

11:15.120 --> 11:21.600
I don't have the fight to, um, I was, I'm just going to be very blunt.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.400
I don't want to blow my way to the top.

11:23.600 --> 11:41.320
Uh, and this industry is very competitive and this, this whole thing, I don't, I don't, I don't think it's for me, but Travis showed me very early on that with a gorilla radio type of setup in your spare bedroom and an internet connection, you can create radio on your own terms.

11:41.680 --> 11:46.800
And that's the path that, you know, we've been forging here at orange launch radio.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.520
And many of you out there that are content creators have been forging ever since.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.480
And it's a, it's a, it's a wonderful, wonderful thing.

11:53.880 --> 12:01.080
So I learned that watching pump up the volume later, that movie was obviously a huge influence as well, but that was a movie.

12:01.080 --> 12:01.400
Right.

12:01.400 --> 12:07.120
And to see it in real life was like, Oh, I don't have to break the law to do this type of thing.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.480
I'd like to, I'd like to thank Christian Slater.

12:09.680 --> 12:13.600
And, uh, what was her name that played the eat me, beat me lady?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.920
Oh, I don't, I don't.

12:15.920 --> 12:16.880
Somebody in chattel side.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.640
I remember who you're talking about, but yeah, I don't remember the actress's name.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.800
Um, it's almost there, but now I'm just, I'm, I'm kidding.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.520
I think Bobby.

12:25.080 --> 12:31.360
Um, so as to show 100, Matt and chat says, if Travis were here, he'd say, I made you, but I'm too old and going to take a nap.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.840
That sounds, that sounds about right.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.440
That's the very time I think of Travis.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.240
I think of him with a bra on his head saying he's queen on the dollar.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.000
It's not just him saying he's queen on the dollar.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.360
He would put the bra on his head and go, I'm queen on the dollar.

12:44.280 --> 12:44.480
Yeah.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.520
This whole thing he would do.

12:45.600 --> 12:54.760
I got to wonder though, is he going to, you know, with the new starfield coming out and stuff, he's going to switch up his cosplay to do some of that instead of all the mass effects stuff.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.320
Or you think he's going to stick with that going forward?

12:57.560 --> 12:58.520
Uh, I don't know.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.760
Cause he doesn't, he doesn't really go to dragon con anymore.

13:00.760 --> 13:05.560
He made a surprise appearance a couple of years ago, but, um, he hasn't been since, Oh, S.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.200
Jonah to Matt says, Samantha Mathis is who you're looking for.

13:08.200 --> 13:08.560
Jamie.

13:08.880 --> 13:13.600
Didn't she play the original princess peach or Daisy, whoever it was in the original Mario movie.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.000
Wasn't that also her in the nineties, Mario movie?

13:16.080 --> 13:16.760
I'm almost positive.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.600
It was, that would be assuming I actually watched that.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.320
Yeah, no, it was interesting connection.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.000
So pump up the volume does connect to video games in many ways.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.080
Um, Rama confirms.

13:27.080 --> 13:27.560
Yes.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.280
And I also want to ignore, uh, acknowledge this.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.120
Um, uh, some of you in chat are saying some very nice things.

13:34.120 --> 13:38.960
Pod culture says, uh, Rob, y'all were the biggest influence on our show.

13:39.320 --> 13:44.240
Um, and, uh, fixie high fixation, gays fixie and chat says ramble away.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.840
This is you guys big day.

13:46.080 --> 13:46.600
Yes.

13:46.600 --> 13:52.040
Um, as Joe and Hunter, Matt pointing out, there were always some webcams, the 56 K cam of the guest couch.

13:52.040 --> 13:52.400
Yes.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.480
There was a webcam in the early days of the show.

13:54.640 --> 13:59.560
It would refresh once every 30 seconds as webcams did back then, but there was a cam.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.320
It did work.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.400
So just in TV, y'all.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.600
Yeah, we were on Justin TV.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.200
Yes, we were.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.040
So there actually still is an orange lounge radio Twitch channel.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.760
It just collects cobwebs.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.680
It is our old Justin channel and there's some old content still there.

14:13.680 --> 14:14.720
If you want to go seek it out.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.360
I mean, have fun.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.640
It's some old shit, but it's there.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.040
Um, you might even find clips of when we were in the garage studio.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.560
So, well, shit.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.280
Now that I've gone down this rabbit hole.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.800
Was it orange lounge or was it orange lounge radio?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.560
I'm trying to look it up.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.120
Oh, some fucker grabbed the name orange lounge.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.920
That's not, that's probably not orange lounge.

14:35.920 --> 14:36.440
I don't think.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.360
No, it's just, it's probably like a fan or something.

14:39.520 --> 14:39.880
Okay.

14:39.880 --> 14:47.600
I found our channel, but unfortunately all I see are clips of the final fantasy 13 demo being played.

14:47.920 --> 14:48.600
Lord.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.560
Um, I don't know if we have any clips from in the studio.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.360
Oh, I see.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.600
I see some things.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.960
Well, the audio would have been from the podcast.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.160
It's just the video was the 13 demo.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.280
Wait, hold on, hold on.

15:02.320 --> 15:02.680
Okay.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.440
Oh, this is great.

15:03.440 --> 15:03.880
This is great.

15:03.880 --> 15:04.240
Hold on.

15:04.240 --> 15:10.000
So somebody clip this, this clip is 15 years ago.

15:10.840 --> 15:11.280
Hold on.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.640
I'm going to put this on the other screen.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.840
15 years ago.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.280
This clip is from check this out.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.160
Uh, if you want to give us a call.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.120
I remember this.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.480
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

15:24.480 --> 15:24.920
Who's this?

15:27.240 --> 15:31.040
Oh, wait, who's this?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.320
And there's intern drew.

15:33.360 --> 15:33.640
Yeah.

15:33.640 --> 15:34.400
You can see there.

15:34.400 --> 15:40.600
Loki is wearing a little big planet costume with the OLR logo intern drew's in the back there.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.760
And I believe that's Bradley Arcadian 42 in the back.

15:44.800 --> 16:01.280
And then dark soccer used to sit on a couch that was over on the right side because she didn't want to be on cam, which, you know, if you've ever paid attention to what happens to women on the internet, sometimes I understand our soccer's perspective at that time and not wanting to be on cam.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.200
There's some really wild stuff here in the background to like all this stuff.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.600
This is like a dear friends poster.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.480
I want to say this is signed in the back.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.480
You know, it's funny.

16:10.520 --> 16:11.440
All the decor in the garage.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.040
What's that?

16:12.720 --> 16:20.240
Drew's picture on my phone is him with the long floppy hair, which of course he doesn't have now.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.880
But I always like I'm so entertained to show co workers.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.360
We worked together.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.160
Look at that.

16:28.160 --> 16:33.440
I'm like, don't don't, you know, he thankfully he grew out of his young republican phase.

16:33.680 --> 16:34.720
Yeah, yeah.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.480
Oh, no.

16:36.480 --> 16:36.880
Oh, no.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.560
Okay, I'm going to do one more one more.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.240
Oh, God, I could fall down a rabbit hole here.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.760
There's a lot of clips on here.

16:41.760 --> 16:42.840
Holy shit.

16:44.040 --> 16:44.560
Oh, my God.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.280
Okay, I got to do one more of these.

16:46.280 --> 16:49.560
This is this one is labeled.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.240
Caramel dancing.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.800
Oh, Lord.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.360
And I have to see what's going on in this clip here.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.080
Hold on, hold on.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.400
Is that Rama in the studio with us?

17:01.760 --> 17:03.000
Holy shit, it is.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.920
This is when Rama was here.

17:10.840 --> 17:11.560
Yes.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.680
Oh, oh, shit.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.520
I'm not on another screen.

17:16.520 --> 17:16.960
I'm sorry.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.360
And that started to you with us.

17:22.360 --> 17:29.800
There are two in the back and drew with the hair and me face palming during this song.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.200
Don't they dance at some point?

17:33.560 --> 17:34.400
I'm skipping ahead.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.640
No, I guess this is just our reaction to the song.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.240
I don't know.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.160
That's that's another very, very old clip.

17:41.320 --> 17:46.880
I did not know this much shit was archived over on the old Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channel.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.720
You have to dig a little bit to find it, but it's there.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.040
That's and I know how to and I know how to download every little piece of it.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.920
You might you might think you might need to send me where was the link again?

17:57.920 --> 18:01.000
It's the it's just Twitch TV, Orange Lounge Radio.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.400
And then you have to actually go into the full videos page and the videos page has everything.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.120
It's not in the main page.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.120
I can get it all downloaded.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.040
Yeah, that might be a fun thing to put together.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.960
Let's hear it for developer mode.

18:15.040 --> 18:15.520
Yeah.

18:15.520 --> 18:15.960
Wowee.

18:15.960 --> 18:16.320
Wow.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.840
What a good trip down memory lane.

18:17.840 --> 18:18.200
My God.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.480
Episode 270 post show.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.760
It looks like the cameras pointed at the TV or something.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.040
I don't remember how we were doing it at the time.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.520
Oh, my goodness.

18:29.080 --> 18:29.440
All right.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.000
I'll see.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.120
Oh, there we go.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.600
Excite truck deathmatch.

18:34.760 --> 18:35.280
All right.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.400
Oh, I'll I'll grab some.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.160
Yeah, dark disease, as I wonder if there's a way to save those clips.

18:41.160 --> 18:41.760
Yeah, that's what Jamie.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.920
Yeah, there absolutely is.

18:42.960 --> 18:43.320
Yeah.

18:43.400 --> 18:52.240
So if you are in if you have developer mode enabled in Safari, you can right click on a video and inspect element.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.040
You just have to know how to read the code to find it.

18:54.280 --> 18:54.720
Wow.

18:54.760 --> 18:55.400
That's awesome.

18:56.080 --> 18:56.400
Yeah.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.200
Fun trip down memory lane.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.240
So that's that's why I knew we had a YouTube channel with some old clips, too.

19:01.240 --> 19:12.560
But that was that I forgot that we actually have basically a Justin TV channel that got turned into a Twitch channel that has really, really old clips of us doing this thing 15 years ago and probably more.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.080
That's appreciation.

19:14.120 --> 19:14.600
Wild.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.560
So yeah, I was looking at some of those videos.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.000
There's a lot of wacky stuff in there, but I love it.

19:20.040 --> 19:20.520
I love it.

19:21.320 --> 19:21.600
All right.

19:21.600 --> 19:29.480
Well, again, thanks from all of us to you all who come out here and listen every week and just have made this show happen.

19:29.480 --> 19:33.560
So, you know, our next big milestone will be episode 1000.

19:33.600 --> 19:44.360
Believe it or not, we're not the first gaming podcast to hit 1000 episodes, but we're the first weekly show one show a week to hit it.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.360
And honestly, in almost any medium I can think of.

19:50.640 --> 19:57.120
I mean, there's some there's others like, you know, there's some shows that have been running like that, like The Simpsons has been running since the dawn of time, right?

19:57.120 --> 19:58.520
But even The Simpsons only does like 20 up.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.600
No, we have more episodes of them.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.000
Yeah.

20:01.000 --> 20:12.880
Well, and if you think if you think about traditional radio things like what's Art Bell show called, but a new guy has run it for years coast to coast, you know, things like that have been running for years and years and years and years, right?

20:12.880 --> 20:14.520
So they're always going to have more episodes than us.

20:14.920 --> 20:19.840
But you know, as far as like internet medium things, there's not like for video games.

20:20.840 --> 20:26.680
They're there, we know we're the oldest that that has done this consistently for this long.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.880
We're the oldest I mean, period.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.960
That's it for video games.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.640
For other mediums.

20:31.720 --> 20:35.480
I'm sure it's, there's probably some tech related shows that have been going about us.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.800
But it's a small circle at this point.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.600
So, um, and big kudos.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.920
I might not be able to download these.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.680
Oh, no, really?

20:44.600 --> 20:49.760
Yeah, they're saying it can't load the the video file off of here.

20:49.760 --> 20:50.680
It's gotta be there, though.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.640
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.360
I'll get it done.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.520
If you can play it, you can download it.

20:54.560 --> 21:02.720
So yeah, but um, yeah, I just want to say, you know, again, not just thanks to all of you, but also, you know, Dark Sakura Loki.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.680
It's our dedication that's had made this happen for 21 years.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.680
So thank you all for you know, being committed to this as long as y'all have as well.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.560
So it's, um,

21:12.960 --> 21:13.880
what else is he gonna do?

21:13.880 --> 21:14.280
I know.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.840
Things hit a hit things.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.040
Things hit that point at some point where it's like, what else am I gonna do Sunday night?

21:23.080 --> 21:23.600
All right.

21:23.760 --> 21:29.200
You know, you know, this has been a very positive part of my life.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.920
You Dan's a podcaster now.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.960
Yeah, he does the pinball stuff, right?

21:33.480 --> 21:34.880
The spinner is lit.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.400
Mm hmm.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.800
So, yeah, it's, uh, yeah.

21:39.800 --> 21:47.680
And Alan had a short lived Warcraft podcast for like six episodes, but I always, you know, he gets into streaming, which is pretty cool.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.320
So now we just need Mrs.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.120
Loki to have a rant podcast of her own.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.040
I think she'd be good at it if she wanted to do it.

21:56.120 --> 22:00.560
The only thing she's watching now that she'd rant on is the Beverly Hills Housewives.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.120
I was gonna say it has to be Housewives.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.120
Which I have watched way too many episodes of already.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.880
Like, I am not happy that I've seen that many episodes.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.120
I would love a Housewives recap podcast for Mrs.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.160
Loki, but it's it's all good.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.160
She can she can enjoy it in peace.

22:18.720 --> 22:27.640
Just imagine like living or like being friends with people that bring up like you said something mean to me like two years ago and I still remember it.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.920
And I'm waiting for that apology.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.040
And like, that's the show.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.360
It's just like super annoying.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.040
Yeah.

22:34.360 --> 22:34.920
All right.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.600
Let's see, comments in chat.

22:38.600 --> 22:48.360
No one special and 777 says, So when our hits 1000, will we get Rob singing a Madonna voiceover or going full diva and sashaying away?

22:48.360 --> 22:50.800
I already went full diva once on this program.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.120
So be careful what you wish for.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.200
I don't know.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.440
The honest answer is I don't know.

22:58.480 --> 23:03.480
Like you, you hit so many milestones, you're not sure how to tell them all apart at one point.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.760
So, you know, we want to still acknowledge and say thank you.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.480
But, you know, I don't know what we'll do.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.960
Like you start paving things with your milestones.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.080
Yeah, yeah.

23:14.040 --> 23:22.280
Such as the background of Street Fighter six that Loki has running there and all the Capcom game milestones you see on the sidewalk there in the background in that earlier scene.

23:22.280 --> 23:25.240
I think it moved into a fighting match, but I caught that in the earlier scene.

23:25.720 --> 23:31.880
I was just hoping there'd be some hot player on refrigerator action, but we haven't seen it yet.

23:31.880 --> 23:32.440
Not yet.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.840
So by the way, I have a theory about this.

23:34.840 --> 23:40.520
And I think that these are really low res, not just because of how we shot them.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.960
I think they were just leftover placeholder.

23:46.040 --> 23:51.000
Because, yeah, I can't I can't get it to load up the original clip from the link.

23:51.000 --> 23:51.800
Oh, wow.

23:51.800 --> 23:56.600
I mean, and they're also like copies of copies from Lord knows how long ago that have been.

23:57.560 --> 24:02.920
If I can get logged into the account and go into the video manager, then I can get them that way.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.880
I would bet.

24:05.880 --> 24:09.000
Well, I don't want to talk about the password, but I'll text you.

24:09.000 --> 24:09.720
I'll text you.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.640
So I gotta I gotta watch my mouth on air.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.360
But I have guesses.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.840
Well, and if nothing else, we can probably reset it.

24:18.840 --> 24:19.400
Probably.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.440
Except the account.

24:20.440 --> 24:24.600
Even if the email account doesn't exist anymore, we can create it and then reset it and then

24:24.600 --> 24:25.320
delete it again.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.960
Because it probably it probably honestly goes to mailbag at orange on trader.com.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.000
But we'll figure it out.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.960
It could go to my personal email to at orange on radio.

24:33.960 --> 24:34.460
So we'll see.

24:35.080 --> 24:35.560
Yeah.

24:35.560 --> 24:39.800
Anyway, um, let's get into some actual gaming news.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.600
That's what we do here.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.280
We talk about what's going on in the gaming industry.

24:42.280 --> 24:46.920
And there's actually continued to be quite a bit this week because it was rumored that

24:46.920 --> 24:47.880
it was going to happen.

24:47.880 --> 24:53.400
And then sure enough, Nintendo decided to show up to the not E3 party as well and drop

24:53.400 --> 24:54.520
some bombshells of their own.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.160
So we have a Nintendo Direct to talk about from this week.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.400
Loki, would you mind walking us through some of the headlines from the Nintendo Direct?

25:01.960 --> 25:02.440
Yeah.

25:02.440 --> 25:10.920
So they started off with showing off some new Pokemon DLC for Violet and Scarlet, including

25:10.920 --> 25:12.280
Area Zero.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.560
So that looked cool.

25:15.560 --> 25:19.480
I don't know, not playing the game, but we knew they were going to be putting out more

25:19.480 --> 25:20.360
DLC for that.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.560
So of course, it makes sense.

25:22.760 --> 25:28.200
They had another trailer for Sonic Superstars, which is coming out like I think this week.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.640
So it's, you know, of course, on the switch as well.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.480
So looks cool.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.400
Trying to get my kid to play it.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.600
But now I don't know if he's going to.

25:36.600 --> 25:40.200
Paulie was another one.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.240
It's a free to play game, kind of a survival.

25:45.480 --> 25:48.280
I was like town building, but yeah, it looked pretty cool.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.200
And that's going to be coming to the switch as well.

25:50.840 --> 25:58.680
Persona 5 Tactica was going to be coming out November 17th and it looked pretty sweet.

25:59.640 --> 26:06.360
This is a neat take on a game, but Myth Force, which is structured.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.920
It's supposed to be like a Saturday morning cartoon.

26:09.560 --> 26:13.720
And I mean, the logo itself kind of reminds me a little bit like Thundercats almost, but

26:15.400 --> 26:19.480
it is supposed to be coming to the switch later this year as well.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.840
And we got some more news about Splatoon 3 Splatfest.

26:22.840 --> 26:27.720
They're going to be doing a toss up between different desserts.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.040
So it looks like frozen yogurt, ice cream.

26:30.040 --> 26:35.080
And I don't know if it's like frozen yogurt as well or maybe I don't know.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.280
Mint chocolate chip or something.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.040
But here's the funny thing about that.

26:38.040 --> 26:42.600
Why wouldn't you'll notice they didn't do chocolate, probably because they didn't want

26:42.600 --> 26:44.760
it look to look like you were flinging poop everywhere.

26:44.760 --> 26:49.880
So they decided to purposely pick something besides just chocolate so that it could be

26:49.880 --> 26:55.240
a better color than brown because the means that would come from brown brown splat, they

26:55.240 --> 26:58.920
just and that's the same reason you're not going to see a yellow or is there a yellow?

26:58.920 --> 27:00.040
I don't think there is a yellow.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.000
He had a medical term.

27:01.640 --> 27:07.080
I probably the vanilla is kind of yellowy.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.040
I don't know.

27:08.040 --> 27:08.520
I don't know.

27:08.520 --> 27:12.680
Well, I'm sure there's probably like a fluorescent yellow, but not like, you know, it's like

27:13.320 --> 27:15.160
well, it's it's.

27:17.240 --> 27:24.600
It is it is a like a don't just take the train and derail it immediately.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.720
Here's the thing.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.160
Here's the thing with the Splatfest.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.840
Why the hell was that in the Nintendo Direct?

27:30.840 --> 27:36.920
Like what a fucking buzzkill that was like the Nintendo Directs have consistently been

27:36.920 --> 27:38.360
botching Splatoon news.

27:38.360 --> 27:39.560
Like, I'm just going to say it.

27:39.560 --> 27:44.520
Yeah, the Splatoon stuff in the last direct was also like not great.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.680
And like a Splatfest.

27:46.680 --> 27:47.800
Who cares?

27:47.800 --> 27:48.040
Sorry.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.120
I mean, I'm sorry to Splatoon fans.

27:50.120 --> 27:55.720
Of course you care, but it doesn't need to be like, are they thinking like, oh, oh, fuck,

27:55.720 --> 27:59.160
I got to get Splatoon three because I got to fight about ice cream.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.640
Who was this supposed to win over?

28:01.640 --> 28:05.000
Like, I just I it was a weird thing to have in the direct.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.760
It was a waste of time in the direct.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.840
It was a waste of ice cream, though.

28:08.840 --> 28:09.340
Yeah.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.800
And it does not look like ice cream.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.520
I'm just saying that.

28:13.320 --> 28:17.960
So they may have missed with they may have avoided the poop thing, but unfortunately

28:17.960 --> 28:19.480
you swung too far the other way.

28:19.480 --> 28:25.000
And yeah, but that is coming out, I guess, July 14th.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.080
It's going to be running through that through the 16th.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.320
So cool.

28:30.360 --> 28:34.840
We got news that there is going to be a new Detective Pikachu returns.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.200
I guess that's the name of the game.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.720
So new Detective Pikachu game.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.760
And it looked cute.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.320
And that is coming out on October six.

28:43.320 --> 28:47.880
Then I mean, I guess the Detective Pikachu news is kind of exciting, but like then they

28:47.880 --> 28:49.000
dropped the bombshell.

28:49.000 --> 28:49.720
The first bomb.

28:49.720 --> 28:50.200
Wait, hold on.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.160
Before I get to the bombshell.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.400
Yeah, I just want to say Detective Pikachu.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.440
I was still disappointed.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.560
It's not Danny DeVito that's doing the voice in there.

28:57.560 --> 29:01.480
People were saying it's Will Arnett, but it's actually not Bobby went over this on his show.

29:01.480 --> 29:06.840
It's actually the same voice actor that does Ichiban's voice, but kind of sounding inspired

29:06.840 --> 29:08.840
by Will Arnett type of thing.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.000
But anyway, you slice it.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.360
It's not Danny DeVito.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.760
And that is quite disappointing.

29:14.760 --> 29:15.960
I'm sorry to say.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.320
So you have that as well.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.600
So anyway.

29:19.880 --> 29:23.000
Okay, so Loki, this was a big one, right?

29:23.720 --> 29:24.220
Yes.

29:24.760 --> 29:29.560
So they announced that Super Mario RPG is getting a remaster.

29:30.680 --> 29:33.720
And that's going to be coming out this year on November 17th.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.640
And it looks fantastic.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.280
That's awesome.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.480
Yeah, it's extremely hyped for that.

29:40.280 --> 29:45.480
This is one of those things that I really did not think this was ever going to happen.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.000
And here we are.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.960
And it's not just re-releasing the old Super Nintendo game, which I think plenty of people

29:51.960 --> 29:53.480
would have been happy with.

29:53.480 --> 29:57.080
But it looks like they have legit reconstructed it from the ground up.

29:57.080 --> 30:03.400
There's no other way to make the game with this much graphical modernness that this game

30:03.400 --> 30:03.640
has.

30:03.640 --> 30:07.480
This is completely remade from the ground up, which makes me wonder if maybe they're

30:07.480 --> 30:08.920
going to add to it or change it.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.520
You know, it would be cool.

30:10.520 --> 30:15.160
I think people are assuming it's going to be a quote unquote, shot for shot remake.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.280
But why should it?

30:16.840 --> 30:21.640
If they rebuilt this from the ground up, which they would have had to do, maybe they've

30:21.640 --> 30:23.080
made some additions or changes.

30:23.720 --> 30:28.040
I don't think we're going to be talking like Final Fantasy 7 remake type of thing, but

30:28.040 --> 30:29.720
it could be DLC or something.

30:29.720 --> 30:30.200
Yeah.

30:30.200 --> 30:32.040
Well, careful what you wish for.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.160
But yeah, for sure.

30:34.680 --> 30:38.040
Because also they're going to charge full price for this.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.560
This is going to be a $60 game.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.560
Now, I think it's worth it.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.000
It better not be a $70 game.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.800
No, it's $60.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.800
The price is already out there because you can pre-order it.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.440
And it's eligible for the Nintendo voucher.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.920
So if you still haven't taken advantage of the Nintendo voucher between this and the

30:53.800 --> 30:55.880
Maybe you still need Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

30:55.880 --> 30:59.160
You probably have stuff to spend the voucher on.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.080
So it's worth considering.

31:01.080 --> 31:06.520
And remember, Costco, you can get $100 worth of credit for $90.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.680
So if you use the Costco hack, or there might be other stores that do this, too.

31:10.680 --> 31:11.960
But I just know of Costco.

31:11.960 --> 31:16.280
If you use the Costco hack, you can get two games for $90.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.040
You're taking it down to $45 a game.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.400
That's a pretty good deal.

31:19.400 --> 31:27.240
So along with that, they announced that there is a new Princess Peach game coming in next year.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.240
They didn't say much about that.

31:31.240 --> 31:33.800
And we've had a Princess Peach game before.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.480
But it was on the DS.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.040
And it didn't look anything like this.

31:38.040 --> 31:41.640
So I think they're just kind of ignoring that one and making a new Princess Peach game.

31:41.640 --> 31:48.680
Because this one, to me, it honestly looked like she had the Dressphere from Final Fantasy

31:48.680 --> 31:51.640
X-2 to me is kind of what I saw here.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.440
But there was very little gameplay at all in this.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.120
You could just see maybe a little bit of the art style.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.800
Maybe looks a little bit Paper Mario.

31:59.800 --> 32:00.440
Just a tad.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.240
Just a tad.

32:01.240 --> 32:04.120
But then you definitely see that she does like, oh, transform.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.480
And now I'm an ice princess.

32:05.480 --> 32:06.840
But don't call me Rosalina.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.760
It looks like a stage almost.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.760
Like everything's a set, which is interesting.

32:13.480 --> 32:19.320
Then Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon is being ported or remastered, I guess, as well.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.560
So that was originally a 3DS game.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.080
And now it's coming to the Switch.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.680
I just want to get some quick comments from chat.

32:28.120 --> 32:28.680
That's funny.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.520
Orange Right says $60.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.040
Technically the budget price now.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.560
OK, maybe not for Nintendo yet.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.360
Vid Power 573 is in chat.

32:36.360 --> 32:40.520
Hello, saying Super Mario RPG was the best thing about that entire Nintendo Direct.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.360
Many people are going to agree with you.

32:42.600 --> 32:47.960
Honestly, that Direct could have been five minutes with just that announcement.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.440
And people would still say it was one of the best Directs they've ever done.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.840
Just because that's the mother load for so many people.

32:54.840 --> 32:59.880
That's the game most people have been waiting for them to remake for a very long time.

32:59.880 --> 33:05.080
So again, honest to God, hear me out.

33:05.080 --> 33:11.240
If they have followed that up with, we're remaking Mother and we're releasing Mother

33:11.240 --> 33:17.160
3 on Virtual Console, that would have literally been the Sony event where they were like Final

33:17.160 --> 33:21.000
Fantasy 7 remake, Shenmue 3, Last Guardian.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.400
We're giving it to everybody today.

33:23.400 --> 33:28.040
Like, like if that if that had been the thought, like this would have been the the the

33:28.040 --> 33:32.680
insurpassable Nintendo Direct if they had put the Mother series out there on the table as

33:32.680 --> 33:32.920
well.

33:32.920 --> 33:36.680
But unfortunately, that is indeed too much to ask for Mother 3.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.400
Still, still think about it, y'all.

33:39.400 --> 33:44.200
We're getting Super Mario RPG remade from the ground up for a modern console before

33:44.200 --> 33:47.960
we get a fucking Virtual Console release of Mother 3.

33:49.880 --> 33:50.840
Just a reminder.

33:51.480 --> 33:51.720
Yeah.

33:53.240 --> 33:59.160
So and then they had to, you know, bring down the hype, I guess.

33:59.160 --> 34:03.880
So they announced that the Batman Arkham trilogy is coming to the Nintendo Switch.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.720
I mean, it's a good series, but it's just, it's so old.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.240
Yeah, it's old news.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.200
This strategy didn't work for the Wii U.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.360
Why should we care now?

34:14.360 --> 34:15.480
I mean, exactly.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.920
They did that last time.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.320
They brought out the Batman Arkham stuff for the Wii U and it was like super late too.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.200
And it's, yeah, the armored edition.

34:25.000 --> 34:25.240
Cool.

34:25.880 --> 34:26.380
Okay.

34:27.720 --> 34:28.600
Gloomhaven.

34:29.160 --> 34:33.400
It's a dungeon crawler game that's coming September 18th.

34:35.400 --> 34:36.520
So like kind of neat.

34:36.760 --> 34:40.840
Also, another game that I didn't need to see a trailer for, but they announced it anyways.

34:41.720 --> 34:44.280
Again, Just Dance 2024.

34:44.280 --> 34:44.520
What?

34:44.520 --> 34:45.640
It's coming to the Switch?

34:45.640 --> 34:46.760
I never knew that.

34:47.320 --> 34:51.560
Like, it's every year, but they're just like, no, hey, there's another one.

34:51.560 --> 34:52.040
Yay.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.600
Then there was some more RPGs.

34:56.600 --> 35:00.280
We had Silent Hope, which looks interesting.

35:01.240 --> 35:10.680
And Fae Farm, which is a fantasy farming game, and that's coming out on September 8th.

35:11.320 --> 35:17.560
The new Hot Wheels Unleashed game, Turbo Charge, is coming out in October.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.600
And that looks pretty cool because the first one is actually pretty sweet as well.

35:21.880 --> 35:28.200
Manic Mechanics, kind of a fun little, like, I think it's like a co-op game.

35:29.160 --> 35:35.720
And we had Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC, which this is shown during the Ubisoft

35:35.720 --> 35:40.600
event as well with Rayman in it as well.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.480
So that's going to be out, I think, later this year.

35:44.440 --> 35:49.480
Dragon Quest Monsters, The Dark Prince, is coming in December.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.480
And that one's been new game.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.840
I think it's been out for a long time in Japan.

35:56.840 --> 36:00.920
It's one of those things where it's like we're finally getting it after a very long

36:00.920 --> 36:01.720
time type of thing.

36:03.960 --> 36:04.680
Let's see.

36:04.680 --> 36:09.320
So then we got yet another trailer or extended look at Pikmin four.

36:10.360 --> 36:13.960
I'm just so glad that this game is coming out so I don't have to see it again.

36:13.960 --> 36:21.160
Like it's been shown so many times, but there's a demo that's coming out later this week

36:21.160 --> 36:23.480
and it's releasing July 21st.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.040
Thank God.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.200
This is kind of neat.

36:26.200 --> 36:31.560
So Metal Gear Solid Master Collection volume one that has Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear

36:31.560 --> 36:36.040
Solid 2 Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is coming to the Switch.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.320
And that's on October 24th.

36:39.320 --> 36:44.920
I did not realize that this was also in Sony's press event because I was texting somebody

36:44.920 --> 36:47.080
and I was like, Oh my God, this looks incredible.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.800
And they were like, it was the same thing they showed at Sony's event.

36:49.800 --> 36:53.160
I was like, Oh, well, Sony did theirs while I was working, so I didn't see everything.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.720
So I'm very excited about this collection.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.520
But you know what makes me like, here's the thing.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.640
It's one thing to have all those Metal Gear games, which looks great.

37:01.640 --> 37:07.720
But did you notice that the MSX version of Metal Gear, as well as the MSX version of

37:07.720 --> 37:11.640
the real Metal Gear two in English are in this collection?

37:12.440 --> 37:13.080
Yeah, that's pretty.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.440
That's all I need.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.680
That is literally all I need.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.960
I don't need anything else.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.040
I'm so excited about those games coming out.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.480
Dark Sakura, you know the Metal Gear MSX stuff.

37:25.480 --> 37:28.120
Surely you've got to be excited to see this coming out too.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.360
I'm excited about this.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.320
That's pretty cool.

37:31.320 --> 37:31.820
Yeah.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.000
Yeah, I know that.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.160
Well, I mean, we've already played through the MSX ones.

37:37.160 --> 37:42.600
Yeah, it was a bonus disc for like Metal Gear Solid 3, something like that.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.960
Well, I'm referring to MSX emulators.

37:45.960 --> 37:46.520
Oh, yeah.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.560
Well, yeah, there's that too.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.060
Yeah.

37:48.700 --> 37:53.100
But it's nice that it's coming in this collection and not in a collector's edition type of thing.

37:53.100 --> 37:55.100
So, yeah, that's really exciting.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.460
Yeah, that'll be neat.

37:58.460 --> 37:58.940
Yes, yes.

37:58.940 --> 38:00.940
Anyway, sorry, Loki, but I had to put that out there.

38:02.940 --> 38:07.740
I was as excited about that as some of you were about the Mario RPG thing, which I'm

38:07.740 --> 38:08.380
excited about too.

38:08.380 --> 38:08.940
Don't get me wrong.

38:08.940 --> 38:09.440
Yeah.

38:10.140 --> 38:13.180
Vampire Survivors is going to be coming to the Switch.

38:13.180 --> 38:13.980
It may make sense.

38:13.980 --> 38:14.700
It's done well.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.860
Kind of surprised it wasn't already there, honestly.

38:16.860 --> 38:17.660
Yeah, exactly.

38:18.540 --> 38:23.500
There is a game called Headbanger's Rhythm Royale, which features a bunch of pigeons

38:23.500 --> 38:25.660
and you have to move their heads and do stuff in time.

38:26.220 --> 38:34.140
It's kind of like a party game slash it almost reminds me a little bit of Fall Guys, but

38:34.140 --> 38:35.740
not with like obstacle courses.

38:35.740 --> 38:39.180
So you're just kind of competing different mini games and getting eliminated as you go

38:39.180 --> 38:40.540
along, which is kind of cool.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.420
Can I quickly just say this comment from chat?

38:43.420 --> 38:49.180
VidPower573 says, surprise, they're including the NES Snakes Revenge game in the collection,

38:49.180 --> 38:52.380
the game that Hideo Kojima didn't approve of back in the day.

38:52.940 --> 38:54.860
Kojima's no longer with Konami.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.860
They don't give a hoot what he thinks at this point.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.020
So I think that's an incentive for Konami.

38:59.900 --> 39:04.380
Honestly, I think it's one of those things where if they hadn't, it's a really easy thing

39:04.380 --> 39:04.940
to include.

39:04.940 --> 39:07.820
And if they hadn't included it, they probably would have gotten crap.

39:07.820 --> 39:12.940
I also wonder, I'm assuming there would be a Japanese version of this release as well.

39:13.420 --> 39:17.180
And so it's kind of the opposite for them where it's like, it's the first time.

39:17.180 --> 39:20.620
Well, it's not really the first time we're getting the MSX games, but for many people,

39:20.620 --> 39:26.060
I wonder if it's the first time Japan gets to see Snakes Revenge officially, not that

39:26.060 --> 39:26.780
they should care.

39:27.580 --> 39:29.100
But you know, it's kind of one of those.

39:29.100 --> 39:29.900
Oh, now I get-

39:29.900 --> 39:31.260
It's not a bad game, actually.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:34.380 --> 39:34.780
Go back.

39:34.780 --> 39:35.260
Go back.

39:35.260 --> 39:35.740
Think back.

39:36.380 --> 39:42.780
When the game came out, there wasn't really anything else too much like it, you know?

39:43.420 --> 39:43.980
I suppose.

39:43.980 --> 39:45.020
It had good music.

39:45.740 --> 39:47.420
It had solid gameplay.

39:47.980 --> 39:53.900
Yes, it wasn't an official Metal Gear Solid 2, but it was a pretty decent game and people

39:53.900 --> 39:56.460
shit on it now because, oh, it's not the real sequel.

39:56.460 --> 39:57.180
Meh.

39:57.180 --> 39:57.980
No, no, no, no, no.

39:57.980 --> 40:00.540
Go back and actually watch a playthrough of it.

40:00.540 --> 40:02.140
It has some really solid music.

40:02.140 --> 40:05.500
It's not a bad game by any means.

40:08.300 --> 40:09.580
Well, you'll have the chance to-

40:09.580 --> 40:10.460
Why watch a playthrough?

40:10.460 --> 40:11.980
You can play it yourself pretty soon.

40:12.860 --> 40:15.100
Yeah, why play it when I could just watch a playthrough?

40:16.220 --> 40:16.620
All right.

40:16.620 --> 40:17.660
Anyway, sorry, Logan.

40:19.020 --> 40:22.220
Then we have a game called Penny's Big Breakaway.

40:22.220 --> 40:25.660
It's a colorful platformer with lots of penguins.

40:26.380 --> 40:27.340
That looks pretty cool.

40:28.140 --> 40:31.500
We got some news regarding the next boost course pass.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.140
Wave 5 for Mario Kart 8.

40:34.780 --> 40:40.460
And they showed off a brand new track that was inside of a bathroom.

40:40.460 --> 40:47.820
And they also have new players, new characters, I guess, coming to the game as well.

40:47.820 --> 40:56.940
So we have Wiggler and Kamek from Mario Kart Tour and also the Piranha Plant from Mario Kart 7.

40:56.940 --> 40:58.060
I don't remember which one it was.

40:59.020 --> 41:00.220
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

41:00.220 --> 41:03.180
Mario Kart 7 had Wiggler and Kamek and Mario-

41:04.220 --> 41:05.660
Kamek's from Mario Kart Tour.

41:05.660 --> 41:07.180
Wiggler's from Mario Kart 7.

41:07.180 --> 41:09.340
Don't remember where the Piranha Plant thing was from.

41:10.460 --> 41:10.940
One of them.

41:12.540 --> 41:15.020
I think those are the two new ones or three new ones.

41:16.220 --> 41:22.220
Star Ocean Second Story R is getting a 2.5D remake.

41:22.220 --> 41:22.860
This is a big deal.

41:23.660 --> 41:24.780
Yeah, that looked pretty cool.

41:26.700 --> 41:27.420
Let's see.

41:27.420 --> 41:28.220
This was sweet.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.380
We're getting a new WarioWare game.

41:30.380 --> 41:31.820
So WarioWare movement.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.220
Can I say just quickly, though, about the Star Ocean remake?

41:35.100 --> 41:40.060
It very much looks like that same engine for Octopath, Triangle Strategy,

41:40.940 --> 41:44.140
this to me looks like it was built in that same engine.

41:44.140 --> 41:47.820
I mean, it doesn't look exactly the same, but it definitely like it's that same style

41:47.820 --> 41:50.060
of like the pixel art on the rendered backgrounds.

41:50.060 --> 41:57.900
And so this very much bodes well for continuing remakes over at Square Enix for some of these.

41:59.740 --> 42:02.860
The more and more of these that come out, the more I go, you know what?

42:02.860 --> 42:04.620
Chrono Trigger isn't out of the question.

42:05.500 --> 42:09.580
I don't want to set the bar too high, but Chrono Trigger is not out of the question.

42:09.660 --> 42:13.020
Even just Star Ocean two is huge for a lot of people.

42:13.020 --> 42:13.980
The fact that that's coming.

42:13.980 --> 42:15.020
So anyway, sorry, Logie.

42:16.140 --> 42:18.620
Yeah, so like pretty cool WarioWare move.

42:18.620 --> 42:22.700
It is going to be a brand new WarioWare game using motion controls.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.740
And I mean, they had me in the first half.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.340
Exactly.

42:27.340 --> 42:30.860
Like I love WarioWare, but the games looked ridiculous.

42:30.860 --> 42:34.860
I'm not I mean, it's something for kids.

42:34.860 --> 42:36.060
That's what I'm chalking it up to.

42:36.060 --> 42:36.620
That's fine.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.940
Not everything for Nintendo has to be for me.

42:39.580 --> 42:43.500
And then we had the last bit of like, eh, it's news.

42:44.220 --> 42:50.620
They tease Nintendo Live Seattle 2023, where you can go check out stuff in person.

42:50.620 --> 42:54.540
That's going to be September 1st and they're open registration

42:55.180 --> 42:57.580
or they already have open registration for that.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.700
And then, of course, new me, both for Tears of the Kingdom.

43:00.700 --> 43:02.380
So Zelda and Gendorf.

43:03.020 --> 43:09.100
And then they ended with a brand new 2D Mario game, Super Mario Brothers Wonder.

43:09.100 --> 43:09.660
Finally.

43:10.860 --> 43:13.820
And it looks awesome and is coming out in October.

43:15.900 --> 43:17.980
Yeah, the new 2D Mario look great.

43:17.980 --> 43:19.340
It had an elephant.

43:19.340 --> 43:22.300
Mario is now like the new thing everybody's leeching on to.

43:22.300 --> 43:25.980
Like, you know, you had cat Mario and then you had a tanuki suit Mario.

43:25.980 --> 43:29.660
You know, there's always like some new Mario suit that people go wild for.

43:29.660 --> 43:32.300
And now Elephant Mario is the new one.

43:32.300 --> 43:33.900
It looks it looks neat.

43:33.900 --> 43:35.020
The game itself.

43:35.020 --> 43:38.860
I didn't think the trailer made it look it looked weird to me.

43:39.420 --> 43:43.340
I feel like it'll look better in long form gameplay than it did in the trailer to me.

43:44.540 --> 43:47.580
I mean, I love 2D Mario games, so I'll pick it up regardless.

43:47.580 --> 43:50.380
But yeah, I mean, it looks pretty amazing.

43:50.380 --> 43:54.220
I'm surprised it took them this long with the movie, but maybe this is something they

43:54.220 --> 43:55.820
were trying to get out with the movie.

43:55.820 --> 44:00.140
And for whatever reason, be it, you know, pandemic went on longer, you know, technically

44:00.140 --> 44:03.020
still going, but, you know, lockdowns went on longer than anyone could thought of or

44:03.020 --> 44:03.340
whatever.

44:03.340 --> 44:08.140
I don't know if it was just a miscalculation on that part, but it is nice to see that it's

44:08.140 --> 44:08.540
happening.

44:09.900 --> 44:16.140
Also nice to see now what Nintendo is doing with their holiday, because remember when

44:16.140 --> 44:19.020
they were trying to make us believe they're not doing anything this holiday?

44:19.020 --> 44:20.940
I was like, that is not true.

44:20.940 --> 44:22.460
I don't believe that for one damn minute.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.220
And so now, OK, here we go.

44:24.220 --> 44:27.420
Mario RPG, a new 2D Mario.

44:27.420 --> 44:30.700
OK, now we're getting a bigger picture as well as like what they're actually working

44:30.700 --> 44:31.740
on for the holiday.

44:31.740 --> 44:33.500
And that's that's pretty cool to see.

44:33.980 --> 44:41.180
Some folks also out there on the Internet believe that that was not Charles Martinet

44:41.180 --> 44:43.740
voicing Mario in the trailer, which is.

44:45.020 --> 44:46.860
Leading to a lot of interesting thoughts.

44:46.860 --> 44:51.900
Sorry, I heard a thud, thud, thud, and it's just Cheddar trying to open one of our cabinets

44:51.900 --> 44:53.100
because he's a little brat.

44:54.060 --> 44:55.100
You know what?

44:55.100 --> 44:59.420
I hear that with Midna trying to open doors and cabinets by head butting them.

45:01.180 --> 45:02.300
She understands physics.

45:02.300 --> 45:03.260
What the hell is that?

45:03.260 --> 45:05.340
Thud noise is like the neighbor banging on the wall.

45:05.340 --> 45:08.620
No, it's just Cheddar trying to open a cabinet off, off cam.

45:08.620 --> 45:08.940
All right.

45:08.940 --> 45:11.020
Oh, you got this Cheddar.

45:11.020 --> 45:13.020
Alan just overheard what I was saying.

45:13.020 --> 45:13.740
Alan went and.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.540
Threatened him with a finger and Cheddar ran away.

45:18.540 --> 45:19.740
This Cheddar is a scaredy cat.

45:19.740 --> 45:24.860
OK, the dark tattoo says, yeah, my wife's cat will do that.

45:24.860 --> 45:26.060
She'll hide in the cabinets.

45:26.060 --> 45:29.980
Dude, if if Cheddar gets in the cabinet, I don't think he's going to be able to have

45:29.980 --> 45:31.660
the physical energy to push himself out.

45:31.660 --> 45:31.980
I don't know.

45:31.980 --> 45:36.060
Maybe he will, but I just I worry he'll get in there and he'll be like, oh, no.

45:36.060 --> 45:37.020
How did I get in here?

45:37.020 --> 45:37.820
How do I get out?

45:39.740 --> 45:40.620
Anyway.

45:40.620 --> 45:40.940
All right.

45:41.980 --> 45:42.540
What else?

45:42.540 --> 45:45.580
Oh, Charles Martinet may not be the voice of Mario.

45:45.580 --> 45:49.660
Maybe this is all alleged, but some people are, you know, sleuthing the trailer.

45:49.660 --> 45:51.020
I have a couple of thoughts about that.

45:51.580 --> 45:57.740
I feel like Nintendo may be realizing that that the voice of Mario cannot just be wahoo,

45:58.300 --> 46:00.060
and all this for a while.

46:00.060 --> 46:05.820
And they have to maybe because of the movie, they're going to have to look at how can Mario

46:05.820 --> 46:07.660
speak in full sentences in the games.

46:08.780 --> 46:11.660
And so they may be looking to recast the voice actor for that reason.

46:11.660 --> 46:17.740
I do not think a certain crispy rodent will be doing the voice at the video game level,

46:17.740 --> 46:21.500
but they'll probably get someone to emulate him, just like, you know, we were talking

46:21.500 --> 46:25.420
about Detective Pikachu and who are who it may or may not be emulating.

46:25.980 --> 46:27.900
Um, and here's the other thing.

46:27.900 --> 46:29.500
What's the condition of his voice?

46:30.140 --> 46:30.300
Yeah.

46:30.300 --> 46:32.940
I was going to say Charles Martinet is also in his late sixties.

46:32.940 --> 46:37.100
And if he wants to have a beautiful retirement, he's earned every minute of it.

46:37.100 --> 46:40.700
If he wants to just go around to conventions and collect money for signing autographs and

46:40.700 --> 46:43.500
doing selfies, that is his fucking right at this point.

46:43.500 --> 46:46.140
So I think we also have to, yeah, there's

46:46.140 --> 46:49.980
June four eight went well into her, you know, nineties.

46:49.980 --> 46:50.780
True.

46:50.780 --> 46:51.280
True.

46:51.840 --> 46:56.640
But, um, you know, there's, but, but she, she won it.

46:56.640 --> 46:59.280
Well, didn't she have a break for a while?

46:59.280 --> 46:59.840
A long while.

46:59.840 --> 47:00.800
And then she kind of came back.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.680
Yeah, off and on.

47:03.680 --> 47:06.160
I mean, I think she was just doing it as she could.

47:06.160 --> 47:06.400
Yeah.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.880
I mean, Charles Martinet may come back for a Mario multiverse.

47:08.880 --> 47:10.400
Well, and again, we're assuming he's gone.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.200
He might not be, but people, you know, the internet's doing its thing.

47:13.200 --> 47:18.400
And I think we do need to kind of realize the Mario movie may have changed some things

47:18.400 --> 47:24.480
and just the evolving technology may have decided to have an impact on the directorial

47:24.480 --> 47:25.280
approach to Mario.

47:25.280 --> 47:30.160
So I'm just trying to prepare everyone for the fact that Charles Martinet may not be

47:30.960 --> 47:35.760
associated with Mario moving forward, but obviously he will always be the voice of Mario

47:35.760 --> 47:36.960
to many of us in our hearts.

47:36.960 --> 47:41.920
But, you know, he joined, he joins a legacy of many awesome Mario's, um, including, you

47:41.920 --> 47:45.920
know, captain Lou, you know, any, many other people that have voiced him in the past.

47:45.920 --> 47:49.200
But, um, you know, anyway.

47:49.200 --> 47:52.960
I mean, think about how many of the modern, you know, cartoons out there where they've

47:52.960 --> 47:58.320
had people, um, you know, new voice actors in the role because someone's died or retired.

47:58.320 --> 48:04.560
I mean, think of how many cartoons had replaced, uh, character voices when Casey Kasem died.

48:06.560 --> 48:09.200
I mean, he was a lot of Transformers voices.

48:09.200 --> 48:13.520
He, um, was, uh, uh, Shaggy, wasn't he?

48:14.320 --> 48:15.040
Yeah, he was Shaggy.

48:15.680 --> 48:16.240
So, yeah.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.400
But now they got Matthew Lillard to do it, so.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.080
Which is, he's fantastic too.

48:20.880 --> 48:21.040
Yeah.

48:21.040 --> 48:26.640
But I mean, I'm just, I'm just saying there's, there's even, you know, modern, you know, mouse.

48:27.600 --> 48:32.240
Well, yeah, I think about, um, not, not because the person died at the time.

48:32.240 --> 48:36.400
Unfortunately, they're no longer with us now, but I think about Aladdin and how Robin Williams

48:36.400 --> 48:41.840
did it in the movie, but then for the sequel, and I think there was a TV show, uh, Dan Castaneda,

48:41.840 --> 48:42.560
I think is his name.

48:42.560 --> 48:43.840
The guy that does Homer Simpson.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.400
Homer.

48:44.400 --> 48:44.640
Yeah.

48:44.640 --> 48:45.440
Does the voice.

48:45.440 --> 48:46.480
No, it's a good, yeah.

48:46.480 --> 48:49.440
Like it was, it was, it was a great job.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.400
Like it almost like it's a talented voice actor.

48:52.400 --> 48:52.560
Yeah.

48:52.560 --> 48:58.480
It was jarring at first, but then like, as you watch the show, you just got used to it and it's

48:58.480 --> 49:00.560
like, Oh, and then you go back and watch the original movie.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.160
Like, Oh wait, that's jarring now.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.120
Like that's weird.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.800
But yeah, he did a great job.

49:04.800 --> 49:05.200
Yeah.

49:05.200 --> 49:10.560
So, you know, that's, that's my thought is they're probably going to get someone to give a more,

49:10.560 --> 49:15.120
uh, crisp rodent type of approach to the character that you saw in the movie

49:15.120 --> 49:18.000
to try to bring those universes a little tighter together,

49:18.000 --> 49:20.560
especially because the movie's getting a sequel.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.400
Like, no question.

49:22.400 --> 49:25.440
No, we're getting a sequel to the movie period.

49:25.440 --> 49:28.480
Uh, the movie did too damn well for us not to.

49:28.480 --> 49:33.680
Um, so the, and you know, you know, obviously these things are planned years in advance,

49:33.680 --> 49:36.960
but I think Nintendo probably took a safe bet that this was going to be a universe

49:36.960 --> 49:38.560
to build on for a long time.

49:38.560 --> 49:43.600
So anyway, some talk about Matthew Lillard and chat, uh, fix, fix.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.840
He is actually saying Matthew is no longer shaggy.

49:45.840 --> 49:48.640
He was replaced for the newer scoop movie.

49:48.640 --> 49:52.800
Uh, and then some folks pointing out that Matthew Lillard will continue to be booked

49:52.800 --> 49:57.280
and blessed anyway, because he's in the five nights universe now with that movie coming out.

49:57.280 --> 50:01.520
So, uh, it's yeah, but I just, I just happened roles change.

50:02.720 --> 50:05.440
He's such a, like a good actor as well.

50:05.440 --> 50:12.960
Like my wife, once again, really into like horrible, um, dramas, uh, but she used to

50:12.960 --> 50:15.440
watch a lot of, Oh God, what was it now?

50:15.440 --> 50:16.080
Good girls.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.080
And Matthew Lillard was in there.

50:18.080 --> 50:22.560
He played a character named Dean who is absolutely hated because he was just like such a,

50:23.440 --> 50:28.080
he wasn't a horrible character, but he was, he's a, he's a weak male character in the

50:28.080 --> 50:29.360
show type of thing.

50:29.360 --> 50:34.000
But like out of like all the cast, like he's like the most humble and the most like approachable

50:34.000 --> 50:36.960
and just overall genuinely nice guy.

50:36.960 --> 50:37.280
Yeah.

50:37.280 --> 50:42.800
So, uh, he was in twin peaks, uh, the, the reboot, uh, twin peaks, 21 years.

50:43.360 --> 50:45.040
What was the name of the reboot?

50:45.040 --> 50:46.000
Not season three.

50:46.560 --> 50:48.160
Oh, the return twin peaks, the return.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.160
He was in that for like one or two episodes.

50:50.160 --> 50:52.160
He wasn't in it very long, but he was in that too.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.840
So yeah, he's, he gets around.

50:53.840 --> 50:54.240
Good guy.

50:54.800 --> 50:55.040
All right.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.560
Anyway, back to the Nintendo direct.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.800
Uh, how did you feel about it overall?

50:58.800 --> 51:01.120
I thought I, I actually watched it live.

51:01.360 --> 51:05.040
While I did emails, cause I didn't have any calls that early, thankfully, but I did emails

51:05.040 --> 51:05.440
on one screen.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.720
I was kind of like watching the other and I was like, dang, dang, you know, like it was,

51:08.720 --> 51:11.200
it was definitely an E3 level presentation.

51:11.200 --> 51:16.000
I mean, there was a lot of filler, but there was a lot of, there was a lot of tent pole

51:16.000 --> 51:18.400
announcements to justify it too, you know?

51:18.400 --> 51:23.280
And in the sense that like, again, for me, I don't really give a hoot about Pikmin 4,

51:23.280 --> 51:26.080
but I realized that is someone else's tent pole game.

51:26.640 --> 51:27.760
Um, and that's cool.

51:27.760 --> 51:30.800
So yeah, there was like, they did have some something for everyone.

51:31.200 --> 51:36.240
Not that I don't like Pikmin 4, it's just that they've, I've seen it so much.

51:37.360 --> 51:41.280
They're like, they're, they're getting to no man's sky type of level of showing that

51:41.280 --> 51:41.920
game off.

51:41.920 --> 51:45.280
Like, and then they'll probably still be another full direct for it.

51:45.280 --> 51:45.920
Of course.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.080
And then there's going to be the DLC and stuff.

51:48.080 --> 51:51.040
It's like, I just like, I don't care about Pikmin that much.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.280
Like, just stop showing it to me.

51:53.280 --> 51:54.640
That's the thing is like, I get it.

51:54.640 --> 51:58.960
I know what's coming out, but like, chill, please.

51:58.960 --> 52:02.640
The Pikmin game I do play regularly, Pikmin Bloom has already announced that they're

52:02.640 --> 52:04.000
going to do a tie in event as well.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.800
But they're just repeating what they already did for Pikmin 3.

52:08.000 --> 52:08.960
When that released.

52:08.960 --> 52:09.280
Oh yeah.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.720
And then Pikmin 1 and 2 are out.

52:10.720 --> 52:14.400
So at least if you are a Pikmin fan, like every game is on the Switch now.

52:14.400 --> 52:15.440
That's not the mobile game.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.120
So that's neat.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.720
It is nice to have everything on one platform.

52:19.520 --> 52:20.880
So all right.

52:21.760 --> 52:22.720
Um, let's move on.

52:22.720 --> 52:26.320
That was a lot of news, but it was a, it was a good, uh, it was a good direct chock full

52:26.320 --> 52:29.920
of a lot of stuff that there's something in there you're looking forward to.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.080
There was something in there you're looking forward to.

52:32.720 --> 52:38.160
If not Mario RPG, then maybe Star Ocean, you know, or Metal Gear collection or something

52:38.160 --> 52:41.360
you're looking forward to in that, that, um, direct.

52:41.360 --> 52:41.600
Okay.

52:41.600 --> 52:44.880
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we have been playing this

52:44.880 --> 52:47.040
week while we wait for all these other games to come out.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.960
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

52:49.920 --> 52:56.720
Um, I played, uh, Dead by Daylight, of course playing the, um, the seventh anniversary

52:57.440 --> 53:01.840
business, um, which is, is pretty fun stuff.

53:01.840 --> 53:06.240
Still a lot of stinky killers, but I was doing some offline play with Fixie and with Shayla

53:06.880 --> 53:10.080
and, um, and I was having fun.

53:10.080 --> 53:12.320
Of course I played Midnight Suns last night.

53:12.320 --> 53:18.000
Um, you know, cause honestly enough, that's like my, my break from everything.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.760
It's the end of my work week.

53:19.760 --> 53:23.280
I need to do something that I can just whatever on.

53:24.160 --> 53:27.600
Um, so, so yeah, I played that last night.

53:27.600 --> 53:31.040
And of course, uh, I did not play Cult of the Lamb.

53:31.040 --> 53:34.640
I actually did not stream on Juneteenth because that's not my day.

53:35.520 --> 53:41.520
It, it was a day to focus on our, uh, our, uh, by POC folks.

53:41.520 --> 53:43.040
And so I didn't stream on that day.

53:43.840 --> 53:50.560
Um, also been playing my stupid word scapes game because I'm an addict and a word nerd

53:50.560 --> 53:51.280
and it was great.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.600
And, um, yeah.

53:56.720 --> 53:59.520
But of course I played pinball because I played pinball.

54:00.640 --> 54:01.200
So that's it.

54:01.760 --> 54:02.080
All right.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.160
Oh, and Dan played, Dan was playing BurgerTime.

54:04.880 --> 54:05.920
Hey, that's a good choice.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.280
I got a BurgerTime machine behind me.

54:07.280 --> 54:08.800
It's a good choice of game to play.

54:10.320 --> 54:10.820
All right.

54:11.140 --> 54:13.060
Uh, Loki, how was your game week?

54:13.940 --> 54:15.700
Uh, I mean, I played Minecraft.

54:16.740 --> 54:17.220
What?

54:17.220 --> 54:18.020
You never play that.

54:18.020 --> 54:19.300
I know it's a shock.

54:19.300 --> 54:21.780
I, yeah, let's just like constantly do that.

54:21.780 --> 54:24.020
No, I took time off to play more Minecraft actually.

54:24.020 --> 54:26.660
Um, didn't get as much done as I wanted to though.

54:26.660 --> 54:29.940
Cause I was trying to get a jump on content creation for the week.

54:29.940 --> 54:33.700
I did put out my episode earlier this week though, which I did a lot in already.

54:34.260 --> 54:39.780
And you know, I'm still working on the two last areas, the two last robot masters.

54:39.780 --> 54:46.660
So I have stuff like for that, I built another, um, or I will be building a another giant,

54:47.300 --> 54:51.140
uh, mega man to enemy.

54:51.780 --> 54:53.540
So there'll be another one of those.

54:53.540 --> 54:59.060
Um, so I did finish that and then, uh, just to try and figure out what I want to put in

54:59.060 --> 55:05.940
some of these areas, it's, it's as the end of the season is getting closer, it is harder.

55:05.940 --> 55:09.540
I am getting to that creativity, uh, burnout.

55:10.340 --> 55:14.820
Well, it's just, I guess, uh, some of this, cause the initial concept for all the robot

55:14.820 --> 55:19.700
masters, they didn't really have like a strong, like, Oh, here's what I want to do for all of

55:19.700 --> 55:19.860
them.

55:19.860 --> 55:22.260
So some of them it's like, Whoa, what do I do for this?

55:22.260 --> 55:23.140
I don't know.

55:23.140 --> 55:28.260
Like in it's kind of sitting there for days until finally something clicks and then you

55:28.260 --> 55:28.900
just build it.

55:29.460 --> 55:36.500
Um, so I'm kind of in that mode right now where like I am building frog man's area,

55:36.500 --> 55:37.620
which is in the swamp.

55:37.620 --> 55:45.700
So there's, you know, uh, I built a Willow tree that looks cool that I'm going to be

55:45.700 --> 55:51.140
decorating stuff with, um, and did some like, uh, paths and stuff, but like, I don't know

55:51.140 --> 55:52.980
like what structures to build there.

55:52.980 --> 55:56.900
I was like, thought about, Oh, cause it's kind of slime based stuff.

55:56.900 --> 56:03.540
So like, uh, not sewage, but like a toxic waste processing plant or something like that.

56:03.540 --> 56:07.940
But that kind of looks like the same stuff that I have on in another area as well.

56:07.940 --> 56:09.940
So I was like, I don't know if I want to do that.

56:09.940 --> 56:12.740
So I'm just going back and forth, figuring out what I'm going to do for that.

56:13.460 --> 56:15.940
Hopefully I get past that hurdle pretty soon.

56:15.940 --> 56:20.820
And then the last bit is going to be Wiley's castle, which at least that I know what that

56:20.820 --> 56:20.980
is.

56:20.980 --> 56:22.740
I mean, that that's pretty easy.

56:23.380 --> 56:27.460
Um, so yeah, wrapping things up there a little bit.

56:27.460 --> 56:30.740
Um, I did, I was hoping to get it this week, but I haven't gotten it yet.

56:30.740 --> 56:36.180
I ordered a, um, because Facebook keeps advertising to me this nonsense.

56:36.180 --> 56:40.660
They have all these like wood kits that you can buy to build things.

56:40.660 --> 56:43.780
Um, and they kind of like a slot together.

56:43.780 --> 56:47.380
So this one is a wooden pinball machine.

56:47.380 --> 56:54.500
It's like a tabletop, like, I don't know, 12, 18 inch machine that actually has the,

56:54.500 --> 56:56.500
all the electronics for it and everything.

56:56.500 --> 56:57.140
So that's gonna be fun.

56:57.140 --> 57:00.580
I can't wait to put that together and, uh, play a little bit of pinball with that.

57:01.620 --> 57:02.100
Nice.

57:02.100 --> 57:04.580
It's circus theme that has a circus.

57:04.580 --> 57:07.540
Thankfully, the circus music can be turned off.

57:07.540 --> 57:08.900
They put a switch in.

57:08.900 --> 57:13.460
Thank you manufacturers for doing that because that would have been irritating, but yeah,

57:14.020 --> 57:16.260
it'll be neat to kind of put that together.

57:16.260 --> 57:16.760
Cool.

57:17.620 --> 57:18.340
All right.

57:18.340 --> 57:19.860
Uh, well, that's it for your gaming week.

57:19.860 --> 57:24.420
Then my gaming week, um, I continued to play Diablo four, uh, still in the end game for

57:24.420 --> 57:25.060
that.

57:25.060 --> 57:26.260
Uh, so it was playing that a little bit.

57:26.260 --> 57:30.180
I was even playing some dead by daylight, uh, a little bit, especially with the, uh, anniversary

57:30.180 --> 57:33.460
event having just started, you know, I got to make sure I get some cakes, uh, that I

57:33.460 --> 57:35.140
can use year round on one of my characters.

57:35.140 --> 57:36.580
So there was that as well.

57:36.580 --> 57:40.500
Um, but obviously if you know me and you've been paying any attention over the last few

57:40.500 --> 57:44.820
weeks, you know, that the day final fantasy 16 came out, I've been on board with that

57:44.820 --> 57:45.540
a hundred percent.

57:45.540 --> 57:49.460
I've been playing that since, uh, the demo kind of picking that up from the demo, um,

57:49.460 --> 57:50.420
and continuing on with the game.

57:50.420 --> 57:55.300
So obviously I'm not done yet, but I've, I've sunk a good, I don't know, maybe 12 hours

57:55.300 --> 57:55.700
into it.

57:56.100 --> 58:01.380
It's, it's literally all on actually at this point, YouTube, because I've been doing something

58:01.380 --> 58:02.180
I don't usually do.

58:02.740 --> 58:07.460
So when I usually stream narrative games, I'll stream the main quest and I'll play side

58:07.460 --> 58:08.980
quests off stream.

58:08.980 --> 58:13.220
But what I'm doing is that I'm still recording myself doing side quests and I'm putting it

58:13.220 --> 58:14.100
on YouTube.

58:14.100 --> 58:16.340
So all of my gameplay is over on YouTube.

58:16.340 --> 58:21.220
Um, over on my, my personal channel there, Rob Roberts plays, don't just go to Rob Roberts

58:21.220 --> 58:24.580
cause that's somebody that sells guns, go to Rob Roberts plays.

58:25.220 --> 58:28.260
And that's my YouTube channel and I have my full 16 play through, or of course you can

58:28.260 --> 58:29.700
follow me on Twitch on there.

58:30.260 --> 58:32.100
So I'm still in progress with the game.

58:32.100 --> 58:34.980
I obviously I'm going to make sure I keep it spoiler free.

58:34.980 --> 58:36.420
I'm not going to do that to you.

58:36.420 --> 58:41.780
Um, but you know, I've, I've been going through some very key elements of the story just finished.

58:41.780 --> 58:49.380
I will say a story mission where I got the prompt that said, you are about to do a pivotal

58:49.380 --> 58:54.820
story in the game and, uh, you will only be able to do certain things from here.

58:54.820 --> 58:58.340
Uh, the type of warning you would get in Final Fantasy 14 before a major quest.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.460
So there were, there was that.

58:59.460 --> 59:05.620
So, um, yeah, I, I I've been exploring the game and, um, I do still really like it.

59:05.620 --> 59:07.860
I do think what's happened.

59:07.860 --> 59:10.420
And I think this is actually very clever on their part.

59:11.060 --> 59:17.300
They really front loaded a lot of the story, meaning that two hour demo or the prologue

59:17.300 --> 59:22.900
or the early years of Clive, as it were, uh, that they released as that demo 10 days ago

59:22.900 --> 59:26.020
was very stacked with story and stuff.

59:26.020 --> 59:32.180
Because when you start the retail game, after that point, the pacing slows way down to what

59:32.180 --> 59:37.380
you would expect in a more traditional RPG, which is let's go find the hub.

59:37.380 --> 59:39.540
Let's explain these systems.

59:39.540 --> 59:43.780
Let's go through some of these maps that are a little bit linear while we're still explaining

59:43.780 --> 59:46.340
and laying the groundwork for the Y and all this.

59:46.340 --> 59:52.420
It's not bad, but it's a real jarring, like pacing shift from what happens in that demo.

59:52.420 --> 59:56.500
It does start to pick back up and there are some more story moments that kick in.

59:56.500 --> 01:00:01.300
You do get it's, it is not, even though some of the early levels, you'll start to be like,

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:06.100
Oh no, we've got Final Fantasy 13 syndrome going on here where the maps are very tunnel-y.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.020
They, they do, they fix that real quick.

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:11.940
And you do get some really big open maps, more like you might see in something like

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:15.700
Final Fantasy 14, again, is a really good mold for what you get here.

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.780
It's like a single-player Final Fantasy 14 game.

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:24.660
But I also understand now playing through this, why Final Fantasy and Square Enix, you know,

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:30.420
and why they're having this crisis about should we even number Final Fantasy games anymore?

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:37.620
Because the series has taken a big shift from the earlier turn-based RPGs.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:41.860
Now, unlike some of the articles I've been reading out there on the internet, which do

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:42.980
not make sense to me.

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:48.020
And I start to wonder, have some journalists played a Final Fantasy game before?

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.700
Have you watched the show Tamar?

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.540
Like, it's very that like, have some of you journalists played a Final Fantasy game before?

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:58.980
Because 16 is not the first time that the game went action-based combat.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.940
That, that's, that's actually what everyone was ticked off about in 15, the last Final

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:04.900
Fantasy game that came out.

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:12.260
I assure you, the combat in 16, way better, light years better than Final Fantasy 15.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.660
It's, it's very satisfying to control and the accessories that you can do and all that

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:23.860
really help you be able to skill the fights down to what you want.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:29.700
But it does take a lot of the quintessential turn-based elements.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.180
Casting magic is different.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.300
It's there, but it's different.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.060
Limit breaks are there, but they're different.

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.940
So it's that the fact that it is a little war rooted in action is going to, you know,

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.220
rub some people the wrong way.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:50.660
But this is a direction the franchise has slowly been moving in since Final Fantasy

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:51.220
11.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:55.540
11 was the first one that got rid of turns.

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.620
They had to because it was a live MMO.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.660
And then some of that was incorporated into 12.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:01.780
12 didn't have turns.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:07.940
And then even in 13, yeah, you, you kind of had the more turns, but it's still, you were

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:11.220
setting up things at a time and it was still playing out live.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:14.660
13 was them kind of trying to marry the two a little bit.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:17.300
But then, you know, ever since then, it's been a little more action-based.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.540
But I understand that the series has departed a little bit from what it used to be.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.340
And that's going to rub some people the wrong way.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.460
I understand.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:30.180
But I still think the game stands on its own as a solid game.

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:35.620
But I understand, you know, it's been a journey from Final Fantasy 1.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:37.780
And it's not a journey everyone wants to follow.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:45.700
Now, I understand that series like Octopath Traveler, Bravely Default.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.460
There's other series out there for folks that missed that.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:52.500
But I understand that there's people that want to see that rooted in Final Fantasy.

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:59.220
That all being said, if you look at the Final Fantasy series as having always been a trailblazer

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:05.300
series of sorts, you know, like with things like the active time battle and things playing

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:08.660
out a little more live, you know, like it did in Final Fantasy 4.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:11.780
And, you know, the gambit system and some of the things that, you know, Final Fantasy

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.900
has really changed the game.

01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.180
And, you know, you kind of look at this as just the series continuing to evolve.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.860
I think it is.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.900
I think it is really neat.

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:19.620
I think it's good.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.020
The story, again, heavy adult themes.

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.340
Some people are going to be really thrown.

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.780
Um, but it's holding up.

01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.460
The story is very interesting.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.940
I thought at first it was getting a little predictable, but then they kind of did a gotcha

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.580
type of moment.

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.500
And I was like, oh, okay, interesting.

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:45.220
I guess the only maybe small drawback I would have is that I have noticed that some of the

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:49.700
dungeons get a little like I was in a dungeon.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.340
I was even on stream and I was kind of commenting like, okay, I'm ready to be done with this

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.860
and to advance the plot.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:01.460
Because I feel like I'm doing trash, trash miniboss, trash, trash, and it starts to fall

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:06.820
into that dangerous pattern from 14, which is something that 14 has been criticized about

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:13.060
is that a lot of 14 is very formulaic, especially when it comes to the end game dungeons.

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:18.340
Every single one of them, trash pack, trash pack, first boss, trash pack, they're all

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.140
the same.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.340
They all look great.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.540
They all sound great.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.980
They all have different mechanics.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:26.420
But there's a certain formula that they have a hard time breaking.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:30.500
And I'm a little worried 16 may fall victim to some of that.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:35.140
But that isn't as hard of a read on the game as you might think.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.780
I actually think there's a lot again, the combat for me not playing a lot of these type

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.980
of action games.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.060
It's really fucking satisfying.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:47.460
And the way you weave in and out abilities like, oh, you're doing Phoenix's move and

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:52.180
then you swap to a different icon like instantly you're doing their moves and swapping again.

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.540
It's really satisfying and feels really good.

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:58.420
So I'm excited to see from here where the story keeps going.

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:01.220
But the early hours have really pulled me in.

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:01.940
That's for sure.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:08.660
SSG100Matt says if OLR is 21 and old enough to drink, Final Fantasy 16 is sneaking into

01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.420
its first R-rated movie.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.260
Well, what's interesting about that, and I was reminded on Twitter, one of our listeners,

01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:19.620
Ziba, hi, if you're listening, reminded me on Twitter, hey, actually 16 was not the first

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.540
game where they were killing chocobos.

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:24.260
Do you remember Final Fantasy Type Zero?

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:27.380
And I was like, oh, yeah, I do remember that game.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:32.980
I didn't like it, but it did have the adult themes were kind of in that game too.

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.700
And it was another one of those like war type of games.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:40.420
I think the battle in that I did not like the battle system in that game, but it's interesting.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.940
Why couldn't I mean, I'm glad it wasn't, but why couldn't Final Fantasy Type Zero have

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:46.980
been a mainline game?

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:53.940
Why couldn't Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin have been a Final Fantasy one part

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.620
zero game?

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.900
Like these, it is interesting.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:08.500
And the Final Fantasy team is having a crisis of and why does Final Fantasy 13 versus get

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.260
upgraded to Final Fantasy 15?

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:15.300
Well, that's because long development time, but like I was going to say, why don't they

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:20.020
why don't they just have spin off series like they did with like a dragon, you know,

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:26.180
where they had that it was its own, which is a term based action game, you know, and

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:26.980
that's amazing.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.860
And that did well.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.380
And you can have narrative and stuff.

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.460
So you can have your KD too.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:36.260
You can make your action games for the folks that like action stuff, and then you make

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:40.980
your traditional Final Fantasy games for the people like the traditional stuff.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:43.540
And then you can even go in the middle and make something, you know, kind of a little

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:44.020
bit of each.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:50.820
But like, I don't I don't really buy into like the excuse that, well, you know, a lot

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:54.900
of people just nowadays they don't like term based stuff because they didn't grow up with

01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.020
it and blah, blah, blah.

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:57.300
It's like, yeah, but like.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:03.700
I don't think that people aren't playing like some of the classic RPGs because they're

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.260
turn based.

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.260
I and I yeah, I also disagree.

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:11.220
Now, while I'm fine with the choice that they made in 16 to do what they do with the battle

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.260
system, I'm fine with it.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:19.780
Yeah, that comment is very short sighted of like Dungeons and Dragons is bigger than ever.

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:24.660
Thanks to the pandemic and, you know, podcasting as well.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:31.540
Like I would say more kids today know Dungeons and Dragons than probably when we were all

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:31.860
kids.

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.500
I mean, sure.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.540
Of course, D&D was the thing.

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.180
We were all kids.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.220
Most of us played it.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:39.220
But I mean, just in the popular lexicon and how many people play it and are exposed to

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:41.220
it, I would actually argue it's more today.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.100
So don't tell me people don't know turn based RPGs.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:44.660
That's a lie.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.180
Well, it's also the same argument that they tried to make before where they said single

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.420
player games are popular anymore.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.660
And then, like, well, that came all their life.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.540
Service game item.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.660
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.220
And all it's like, that's not true at all.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:00.420
Like, and then they have the eat crow on that as well.

01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:04.100
But I mean, obviously, the reason they made that argument the first was because they want

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:07.460
to go live service so they can monetize the crap out of it.

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.780
They're like, Well, see, you guys wanted this.

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.580
It's like, no, no, no one did.

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:17.940
And that's the thing, too, with Final Fantasy 16 is I think a lot of it, it could be almost

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:22.180
like you're changing it so much that you're going to lose the people that were like kind

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.500
of fans of Final Fantasy to begin with.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.700
And that's kind of the thing, too.

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:31.940
For me, like even with a 15, like it was so radically different than, you know, maybe

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:36.820
like not as radically different as 13, but like it was different enough to where like

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:38.180
I didn't stick with it.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.700
And normally, like I will finish all of those Final Fantasy games.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:47.380
But that was like one of the first ones that in type zero that I didn't really want to

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.340
finish.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.820
And that's why I was kind of like, well, aside from the fact it's on PlayStation five and

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:57.620
I don't own a PlayStation five, that's the only reason I'd hesitate on Final Fantasy

01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.340
16.

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:03.780
And and like even the review that I watched from a reviewer that I respect, didn't like

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.420
the game.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:10.820
And they didn't like it because that it felt like there was very little in the sense of

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:17.220
gameplay and a ton of cut scenes, like 75% of the game is cut scenes, which there are

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:22.100
better ways to like tell your story and have cut scenes incorporated with that.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:25.540
But I would be curious, what did that what did that reviewer think of persona then?

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.940
They like persona.

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:33.700
Okay, so so so so I'm sorry, but that's that do you see where I'm like that they just

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.660
contradicted themselves.

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.020
Right.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:42.820
I think though, that in this sense, it was more of like, you know, you can have cut scenes

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:49.220
that are like kind of like God of War, for example, God of War has story cut scenes that

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.820
are in the gameplay.

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.620
It's not just like, okay, I'm doing game and stop.

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.460
And now you got to watch cut scene.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:03.300
You know, it's your interacting with it, you it's it's told in a dynamic way that doesn't

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.460
interrupt the gameplay flow.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:05.960
Yeah.

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:07.780
Yeah.

01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.740
I mean, I don't know.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:12.100
Like I think the cut scenes are fine as for a Final Fantasy game.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.740
I'm not bothered with it because I feel like all like all Final Fantasy games since like

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:22.180
seven fuck even like four and six and five had like very long sequences where you weren't

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:22.820
doing anything.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:25.620
I mean, probably not as bad in the Super Nintendo era, but especially when you started

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:26.660
getting to seven.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.380
And so that like the cut scenes are like a mainstay in it.

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:30.980
And you know, you're kind of there for the story.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:37.460
But I mean, I can see where maybe some of my complaints about how some of the formulaic

01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.500
layout and then you combine that with the cut scene.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:45.940
I can see where some people can maybe like get a little irritated with that, you know,

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.260
so, you know, again, I'm not saying this game is perfect.

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:52.100
I'm not even I'm actually at this point, not sure it's going to be my favorite Final

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:54.420
Fantasy game, but it's going to be in the top half.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.660
I could I, you know, I'm not through.

01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.820
I may be 40% of the way through the game.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.860
I already know this is better than 15.

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:02.900
It's better than eight.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.780
Sorry, not sorry.

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.060
It's better than two.

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:08.900
It's better than like the bottom tier of Final Fantasy for me.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:14.580
It's better than it's certainly better than 14 original version, which is the worst Final

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.220
Fantasy game.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:21.140
So 16 will absolutely be in the top half of the ranking.

01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:23.140
I'm just not sure exactly where yet for me.

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.860
But I think, yeah, it's there's a lot of good stuff in there.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:31.460
But I'm curious to see where the story ends up going.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.620
I have I've seen that there is criticism about that the story apparently takes a turn at

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:40.340
some point, and that the back half of the game was not as exciting as the front half

01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:40.740
of the game.

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.780
I've heard that.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.820
But I'm going to draw my own conclusion on that.

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:50.020
And because, you know, again, critics, I don't know, they don't always see it the same way

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:50.500
I do.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.380
So we'll see.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:52.980
All right.

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:55.060
That was my gaming week.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.300
Let's get into some gaming news.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.660
Quickly, though, I want to just do some quick housekeeping things.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:05.380
I want to give a shout out to the Dragon Con digital media track because earlier this week

01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:13.460
on the 20th, I was able to moderate a virtual LGBTQIA kind of panel discussion with some

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:16.740
other content creators over there on the Dragon Con digital media track.

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.620
That was really cool.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.460
It will be archived on YouTube soon.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:22.660
I don't think it's there yet, but I'll post the link on socials when that's up.

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.900
But I just wanted to acknowledge and thank the folks that participated with that and

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:28.820
the Dragon Con digital media track for doing that.

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:36.820
Speaking of things to do in Atlanta, we will not be here the week of July 30th because

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.820
I will be in Atlanta.

01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:43.780
I'm going to be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.460
I keep forgetting they changed their name a few years ago.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.540
But I will be there at that expo to help them celebrate their 10th anniversary.

01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:51.780
I'm very excited about it.

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:53.380
I'm looking forward to being there.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.180
My picture is even on the website as somebody that's going.

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.380
So that's really fun.

01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:58.500
I was very happy to see that.

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.420
That's always a fun thing to do.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.100
So I look forward to joining you all in Atlanta twice this year.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.460
Once for SFGE and once for Dragon Con.

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.660
But unfortunately, because of that traveling, there won't be a show that weekend.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:11.940
But that's like a month away.

01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:13.780
But just warning you all.

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.380
Okay, let's get into some news.

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:19.220
We'll probably, since the front half of the show is really long tonight, I'm probably

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.780
going to accelerate our pacing on these stories a little bit.

01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:23.620
But I know there's some things we want to talk about still.

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:24.260
So, Loki.

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:27.220
Yeah, this is kind of a minor story.

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:33.380
But the Game Pass prices are rising, apparently.

01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:38.740
So and including the Xbox Series X will also be increased worldwide.

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:47.380
They're saying that the Game Pass is going to be going up from, I guess it's not a lot.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.820
It's like a buck or so.

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:58.740
So from $10 to $11 worldwide and the Game Pass ultimate is going up from $15 to $17.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:03.940
And Microsoft, of course, says, you know, we've held our prices for consoles for many

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.980
years and adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market.

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:14.420
And these Game Pass price adjustments are not related to the Activision Blizzard deal

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:17.540
and are intended to match our local market conditions.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:26.900
So they're saying that the Xbox Series X will remain $500 in the US, but it's going up to

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:38.260
550 euro in Europe, $650 Canadian in Canada and $800 Australian in Australia.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.660
That's beginning August 1st.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:45.140
The Game Pass pricing is going into effect July 6th, so right around the corner.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:45.880
Hmm.

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:51.940
So stock up on that year of Game Pass if you want to get in at the lower price or whatever.

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:59.060
So I mean, we kind of knew the Game Pass price was going to go up eventually, but I just

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:03.700
feel like I don't think Game Pass has had quite as strong of a year as previous years.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:07.380
I feel like a lot has been delisted from the service and they're adding new things, but

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:09.860
it's not they're not really getting the big, big names.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.220
I think Starfield is good.

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.540
That's you know, I know I'm very happy about that.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:17.380
And there'll be some other big names too, but I'll pay it.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.820
You know, it's still a great deal and so forth, but it's just one of those like, oh, it's

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.340
just the timing of now.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.540
It's like, oh man, if only the Activision merger could finish and they could add all

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:32.900
those games too, then I think it gives them really the bandwidth to really up, which they'll

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:35.540
probably do again once that happens, quite honestly.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:36.660
But we'll see.

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.100
We'll see what happens because that merger may not happen, but we'll get to that news

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:40.600
later.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.400
All right, let's move on.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.200
Let's talk about one of those big Activision games, Diablo 4 out of Blizzard.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.520
People now that more and more people are finishing the main story, people are looking forward

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:57.240
to the seasonal content.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:03.000
At some point in July, Diablo 4 seasons will begin and it's getting some pushback because

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.320
the seasonal content is going to require players to complete a new character.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.800
It was talked about in a blog.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.440
Well, actually the blog post didn't talk about it.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:21.000
And then on Twitter, Rod Ferguson responded to somebody, I think it's, I'm going to just

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.440
bite my tongue, but I just don't think this person usually contributes great articles.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:33.480
But anyway, saying that you will, yes, to take part in the seasonal quest line, mechanics,

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.560
season journey and battle pass, you will need to create a new seasonal character playing

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:41.640
campaign with seasonal character will also progress the season journey and battle pass.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.400
And people are not happy about it.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.400
Saying, as a new player, I don't see myself grinding like this again, if I have to start

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.960
from scratch, I'm likely done maining Diablo.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.880
And I know a ton of people in the same boat.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:00.520
I'm sorry, why the fuck are you maining Diablo and going so far to say that if you didn't

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:05.480
play Diablo two or three, where this was the exact same way it worked.

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:07.320
This isn't news.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.120
Diablo has always done a level read.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.800
That's what seasons are all about.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:19.560
So I'm trying to like figure out like, why are people so weird about this when it's literally

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.600
always been this way?

01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:27.400
And my only thought is because of that open world, really strong narrative structure of

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:32.440
Diablo four, people are really worried about having to play it all over again.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:38.200
But they've already said, if you've played through the main story already, then when

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:44.120
you do seasons, the map is unlocked, the Lilith statues are unlocked, you don't have to do

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:44.680
that again.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:49.640
You just get that on your seasonal character and you can level however you want, which

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:53.640
is how you leveled seasonal characters in three and then to remastered when they went

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.280
back and did that.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.720
I really failed to see the problem here.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.120
And this is one of those headlines that again is being copy pasted like wildfire.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:08.840
And I don't understand the hysteria around it, but I'm pretty passionate about Diablo.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:15.560
It's no no secret around here, but I just it's it's silly.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.800
It's it's non non news to me.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.440
Pirate pound town and chat says, Yeah, this is just bandwagon gamers jumping into Diablo

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.280
without knowing what Diablo is.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:24.840
That's what it's.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.400
So when somebody says I'm maining Diablo, you didn't put a lot of research into that

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.120
before you did it.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.080
Now, did you?

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.920
Because that's that sounds like a content creator saying that.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.680
And I'm like, do your homework before you declare that you are the world's definitive

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.040
Diablo streamer.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.000
Like, obviously, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's just that comment just

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.120
comes from a place of, do you watch the show Tamar?

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:55.720
Anyway, let's move on to other news.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:59.080
Dark Sakura, why don't you talk about a completely different game for us?

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:06.600
Well, for anyone who is a fan of the original chocobo racing, there is now chocobo GP.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:14.680
And it's not going to nickel dime you for making any progress in there.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:27.000
And it has a new eShop store page that shows that it's like a rerelease on the switch

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:27.960
for June 15th.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:32.280
It's going to have some neat little stuff in there.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.640
I'm sorry, I can make words happen, I promise.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:48.280
But basically, this is it really got bad reviews before, partly because of the paywalls

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.320
and the grind and all of that.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.640
So now it's just going to be open.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.240
You also will get extra experience points.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.520
Well, sorry, they did do extra experience points as sort of an apology for that.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:14.680
But now this one is pretty much going to be, they're not going to do any big updates,

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.640
no new characters.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:27.080
And yeah, so the rerelease is going for about 50 bucks.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:33.560
But this is, yeah, just you can transfer your previous save to the rerelease version.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.640
Just by buying it as an upgrade DLC for the light version.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.080
And then there you go.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:39.580
Yeah.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.600
And Mike Deft in chat saying this is what it should have been from the start.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.600
Dark Tetsuya is saying, I don't know, I got to say the ship has sailed on this one.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:51.800
They should have done it this way from the get go instead of charging 40 bucks for a

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:53.080
free to play game.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:55.400
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm with all of you.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:59.160
Like this is definitely them going back and going like, whoops, this is how we should

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.280
have done it from the beginning.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.480
And for all intents and purposes, it's probably too damn late.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:11.240
But it is interesting and rare to see a game company do that and try to be like, oops,

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:15.000
let's relaunch this game the way the fans are saying we should have done it in the first

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:15.500
place.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:17.560
It is rare to see that.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.400
I just don't know if I'm interested anymore.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:27.000
I have been interested since Chocobo racing.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.640
Yeah, yeah, I loved Chocobo racing.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.400
I didn't love Chocobo GP when I played it.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:39.720
And I think, admittedly, the whole micro transaction system was a part of what left the huge taste

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.280
of my mouth.

01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:46.200
But honestly, do I care enough to go back and now play a full retail price for the game?

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.340
Nah.

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:49.880
Nah, I'm over it.

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:51.720
Which is a bummer.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:54.280
I mean, there are people out there who are very happy about it.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:55.400
And I'm glad for them.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.240
Yeah, and my dad says I care.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:57.740
Yeah.

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.300
Yeah, our opinion is not necessarily the definitive.

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:05.420
People are burned by different fires.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.060
Yeah.

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:12.220
And to be fair with what Dark Tetsuya says, maybe if it went on sale, I could go, yeah,

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:16.460
like when that game comes down to $20, because inevitably it will come down to $20 and I'm

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.300
willing to play that waiting game.

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:19.660
I'll probably pick it up then.

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:20.540
I'll pick it up for $20.

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:27.660
But I'm not going to pay, you know, for, yeah, what it should have been the first time.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:32.300
So anyway, let's move on.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.360
Loki.

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:34.700
Yeah.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:42.940
So there's more drama still with the whole Activision Blizzard acquisition and Sony PlayStation

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.060
along with that as well.

01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:52.860
So now this is a little bit that came out about Jim Ryan and some of his private remarks

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.060
regarding the acquisition deal that was going in place.

01:22:56.060 --> 01:23:02.860
You may remember that Sony has made the argument that if that they don't believe that Microsoft

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:12.140
will make good on their promise to keep Call of Duty multi platform in public, they say

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:17.740
that at least Jim Ryan, however, in a private email that was shared, apparently with the

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:21.020
court, said it's not an exclusivity play at all.

01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:27.420
It says they're thinking bigger than that, and they have the cash to make the moves like

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:27.660
this.

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:35.420
I spent a fair bit of time with Phil Spencer and Bobby Kojic over the past day, and I'm

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:40.460
pretty sure we will continue to see Call of Duty on PlayStation for many years to come.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:48.780
So like they know that it's going to be, you know, available for the PlayStation.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:55.100
Microsoft is committed to three years already, and yet they're just making it out, obviously,

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.180
because they don't want the deal to go through that.

01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.060
No, no, no.

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:03.580
It's not going to be, you know, exclusive at all, even though in their minds it is.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.940
It's going to be available on their system, and that's not an issue.

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:11.580
Also, this was crazy as well.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:20.940
Well, Jim Ryan also shared that if Activision were to be actively to be acquired by Microsoft,

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:27.500
then Sony wouldn't share PlayStation six info with the developers of Call of Duty.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:33.660
Also, another argument that they've made before is that, well, you know, if Microsoft buys

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.780
Activision Blizzard, they're just going to make a version of Call of Duty that's going

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:39.180
to suck on PlayStation hardware.

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:42.060
It's just going to play poorly and they're going to think, oh,

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:45.580
it's the PlayStation hardware and not Call of Duty that's playing poorly.

01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:50.300
But now you're like saying that, oh, well, we're not going to give you information about our system.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.220
So what do you think is going to happen from that?

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:56.940
You would get a product that is not going to perform as well as it could because you're

01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.820
withholding information because you're worried that they're going to have some sort of insider

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:04.140
information that will affect, you know.

01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:08.620
The creation of the next Xbox console or something like that.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:12.620
It is just ridiculous that you would go that far.

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:16.220
This court case is making Sony look real bad.

01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.980
It's making them look drunk with power.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:20.140
It's making them look like the one percent.

01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:25.740
And it's it's making Microsoft look humble, which is a weird thing to say.

01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:30.380
But as far as the games division goes, like you see Microsoft kind of admitting they know

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:33.500
they're lagging behind in the race and they know, you know, some of these things.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:36.620
And yet they still, you know, they know they have to put games on certain consoles.

01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:41.180
And just the whole fact that Sony is like withholding and doing what they're withholding

01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:44.380
and then coming on the other hand and saying, oh, but we know we're getting a lesser than

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:48.300
version, like it's almost like they're they're they're the ones trying to squelch the

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:52.140
competition in the marketplace and it's coming out in court.

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.100
And it really doesn't make Sony look good, to be honest.

01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:58.460
I don't think most gamers are going to give a shit because at the end of the day, Sony's

01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:01.420
got really great exclusives and a pretty damn good console.

01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.940
And that's what the gamers are.

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:07.100
But it's when you look at the business side of things like you definitely look at this

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:09.580
and you're like, Sony is not the good guy here.

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.660
And I'm not before you all today.

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.020
Oh, I'm a Microsoft fanboy.

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.700
I'm a Microsoft apologist.

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.740
I'm sorry.

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:21.100
It's just like, again, I'm allowed to draw conclusions and, you know, make opinions based

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:22.300
off these court documents.

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:24.780
It does not make Sony look like nice people.

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:26.620
It really doesn't.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:27.020
Yeah.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:29.180
And it's just like business isn't nice.

01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:30.940
I understand that.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:35.180
But it's just like one of those like, oh, it just makes a lot of those complaints that

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.300
Sony's putting out there.

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:38.860
Like, it's really exposing it for the bullshit that it is.

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:40.300
Yeah.

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:42.540
And honestly, I'm sorry.

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:47.580
Look, I worry our legislators and I worry they're too dumb and they're going to fall

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:48.380
for it.

01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:49.340
Of course they're dumb.

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:52.380
Like, I mean, they don't understand how any of this stuff works.

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:56.780
Although I would say that they're probably more willing to side with Microsoft on this

01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.860
because Microsoft being an American company and Sony being a Japanese company.

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:05.660
Unfortunately for them, it's just, you know, USA, USA, USA.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.900
And it doesn't matter what the situation is.

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.660
I honestly don't think that they understand fully what's going on here.

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:16.220
And it's also very hypocritical of Sony, too, because Sony does the exact same things when

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:22.380
it comes to given the opportunity, they will absolutely pay for exclusivity on their console.

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:24.380
They have fucking look at 16.

01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:30.300
That's not to say that Sony or Microsoft hasn't done the same thing in the past with like

01:27:30.300 --> 01:27:32.060
third party stuff as well.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.020
But you may get like a year of exclusivity or something like that.

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:38.220
But like, but yeah, they do this.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.620
And to pretend like we don't do this, this is ridiculous.

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:44.060
We would never do that.

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:44.860
Like, come on.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:47.900
Like, we don't trust you at all to do this.

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:53.100
And like for me, like, I don't even care anymore about console wars because I'm just going

01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.500
for PC, PC, I win out everything.

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.140
I can play all the different systems on PC if I want to.

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.060
I mean, emulating Switch, of course.

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:05.900
But like I it's it doesn't really make sense to me to like dive into a console anymore

01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.500
because I just don't play my consoles.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.500
Like I don't play my PlayStation four.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.980
I haven't played that in like over a year.

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:16.300
And my Xbox Series X is in a box under my desk right now.

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:19.580
Like it is not being used at all.

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.460
Like I just I don't know.

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.900
I bought a Series X and I used it hard for like two years.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:31.420
But then when I upgraded my PC, my Series X is now the downstairs media device so that

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:35.100
Alan can watch 4K stuff through the Series X.

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.180
Like that's our PS3 for that.

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:41.100
Yeah, it's seriously like it made me reconsider.

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:43.740
That's why I was like, well, do I really want a PlayStation five?

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:46.380
Probably not, because like I just won't use it.

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:49.500
Like I won't get the money out of it like that.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.260
It's just not worth it, especially for PlayStation VR, too.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:57.340
Like that's just a money pit right there.

01:28:57.340 --> 01:29:02.620
But yeah, I just we don't like any of these corporate companies nowadays.

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:06.300
You just we've gotten burned so many times by corporations.

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.500
I just don't trust Sony in this sense.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:11.980
I don't trust Microsoft either, like 100 percent.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:15.580
But at least they've been seeming to be more on the side of like the consumer.

01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:19.900
Recently, that could all change one day, sure.

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:22.540
But like right now, they seem to be on the consumer side,

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:24.300
at least Game Pass is a great deal.

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:27.580
So well, it's a lot of that is in the leader.

01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.540
A lot of it is in the leader.

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:29.420
Yeah, for sure.

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:30.300
Gaming on my Mac.

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:34.140
I don't trust anybody.

01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:37.180
Well, and you don't have as many games to play either.

01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:39.820
Yeah, actually, I pretty much can play just about anything.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:43.740
So some of those games that you've talked about streaming in the past.

01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.380
Well, come the next operating system, I won't have that problem at all.

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:50.220
Ask Whoopi Goldberg how Diablo 4 is going.

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.580
Come the next operating system, I won't have that problem at all.

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.460
I heard about that.

01:29:56.060 --> 01:29:57.580
Some other comments in chat.

01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:02.060
Dartusia says, I don't know, we're using our series S lately for D4

01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:05.100
when the network wants to work and Street Fighter 6 mostly.

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:10.460
And honestly, Dartusia, if I hadn't upgraded my PC, I'd probably be in the same boat.

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.780
I'd be using a console to play those games as well.

01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:14.540
Absolutely.

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:15.740
But yeah.

01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:19.420
Also, you can play Diablo 4 on a Mac.

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:20.460
GeForce Now has it.

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:22.860
Oh, I didn't know GeForce Now has it.

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:23.180
That's cool.

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:25.820
Well, somebody needs to send that to Whoopi Goldberg.

01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:33.580
So yeah, pretty much anything that's worth having is either coming out natively or is on a stream

01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:40.140
service and like everyone knows the next, you know, as already has come out for the next OS

01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:47.900
that the line like deal is going to basically make Maxfully Gaming compatible.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:53.260
Well, and, you know, you bring up a good point about the cloud gaming in general.

01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:58.700
I mean, that's just that's enabling gaming on many, many more devices,

01:30:58.700 --> 01:30:59.980
Max and otherwise.

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:04.860
And, you know, laptops and, you know, phones, I guess, and tablets and things like that.

01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.260
That's where, too, that's a lot, you know, cloud gaming.

01:31:07.260 --> 01:31:10.220
We kind of look at how much of the future is really going to be in cloud gaming.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:15.980
Again, I think we're just stable 5G over connections away from cloud gaming really taking

01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:16.540
over.

01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:20.380
And I think and so it's interesting to kind of go back to a lot of where this conversation

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:21.900
started about console wars.

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:28.460
I think that's the big, ironically, cloud looming in the sky is once 5G is available

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:28.940
anywhere.

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:32.540
I don't think you're going to need consoles anymore in the traditional sense.

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.420
So they're still going to try.

01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:39.740
Of course, they're going to try really slow to abandon technology, but it's going to be

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:45.420
interesting to see how the consoles might evolve to make that case for what cloud gaming

01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.220
can't bring you.

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.220
It'll be interesting to see what they do.

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:50.780
Excuse me.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:56.140
Well, that court case has really been fascinating to see play out, and we're still going to

01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:57.340
get more gems out of that.

01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.060
That's for sure.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:00.540
Loki, I'm sorry, I might have missed it.

01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:02.860
You talk about the PlayStation six, that part of things.

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:04.380
Yes.

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:05.020
Okay, sorry.

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:12.780
Then let's talk about a different six in a series that I don't know if this game is ever

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:13.100
coming.

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:16.140
It feels like Elder Scrolls six.

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:21.260
Apparently, this was something that came out of this recent trial as well, or whatever

01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:26.060
the hearings, whatever you want to call it that's going on right now is that even though

01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:34.460
the Elder Scrolls six was announced five years ago at the 2018 E3 Expo, it was said

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.620
by Phil Spencer, this game is still five days or five days away.

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:45.980
I wish five plus years away, saying under oath, quote, I think we've been a little unclear

01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:50.060
on what platforms that will launch on given how far out the game is.

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:53.900
It's difficult for us right now to nail down exactly what platforms the games will launch

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:54.460
on.

01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:59.500
As I said with Elder Scrolls six, it's so far out, it's hard to understand what the

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:01.580
platforms will even be at this point.

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:05.580
It's the same team that's finishing Starfield, which comes out in September.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:09.180
So we're talking about being likely five plus years away.

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:13.900
So when he's talking about platform, he's not talking about Sony versus Microsoft.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:17.340
He's talking about would it be PS five or PS six?

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:23.500
Because they might be needing to prep this game for a more advanced console and the Xbox

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:28.700
equivalent of that, obviously, like whether it's series Y or whatever it is.

01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:34.940
Phoenix 7726 says, Rob, at this rate, Elder Scrolls is going to beat Kingdom Hearts for

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.860
longest gap between sequels.

01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:44.380
This just also goes to show how freaking long it is between big budget games.

01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:49.820
I mean, you know, earlier in the show, I was talking a lot about Final Fantasy 16.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:53.420
Think about how long it's been since Final Fantasy 15.

01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:57.100
It's been seven years since Final Fantasy 15.

01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:58.380
Wow.

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:07.980
Seven years is more time than what passed between Final Fantasy four, five, six, seven

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:09.580
and eight.

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:13.260
No, was 491 or 92?

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:16.540
Because eight was 99.

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:19.420
So 92 would have been seven years ago.

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:26.780
But at least five, six, seven and eight were all done within the same period that it's

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:29.100
taken 15 to 16.

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:30.540
So that's kind of food for thought as well.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:36.140
That just speaks to the long development cycle of a lot of these games now, for sure.

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:38.940
So, you know, I'm not totally surprised to hear this now.

01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:42.220
I'm kind of wondering, well, why did they announce this way back as they did?

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:48.140
But, you know, this was also before the Microsoft purchase, and maybe they had a different plan

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:48.700
to get there.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:52.940
I'm not saying Microsoft's delayed it, but maybe Microsoft's going to force it to be

01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:56.460
a more quality product when it comes out being less bugs.

01:34:56.460 --> 01:35:03.180
Starfield is going to be very telling for if Bethesda has maybe changed some of their

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:09.660
things that they get razzed for a lot in the QA department or lack of addressing QA department,

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:13.260
I should say, since Microsoft took over.

01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.100
Because if Starfield is still a buggy mess, people are going to be like, why the fuck

01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.940
did they delay this as much as they did?

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:24.140
But if it's really, really polished, people are going to be like, wow, a Bethesda game

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:25.180
that actually, yeah.

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:31.340
So Phoenix 7726 says, to be fair, Rob, those games were not nearly as complicated and took

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:32.700
much less time to develop.

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:35.420
And at this point, these times are just going to keep going up.

01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:36.300
Oh, exactly that.

01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.700
I actually am making that same point.

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:44.060
Yeah, it wasn't as hard to do the sprite art in those days, and even the PlayStation 1

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:48.540
style art from seven and eight, and what goes into those games, then what games require

01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.040
today.

01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:53.340
So there's going to be a long wait between 16 and 17.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:57.580
But I guarantee 17 is already under development.

01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:02.060
I think the question is, is it another MMO or not?

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:05.100
Because 11 was an MMO, 14 was an MMO.

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:09.020
So if they follow the pattern, 17 would be an MMO.

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:13.180
I'm not sure they want to do an MMO now.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:18.780
Again, I feel like 14 is still riding a wave that they could have another single player

01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:20.140
game in a 17.

01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:25.260
But it's so hard to say, you know, again, Square Enix maybe doesn't want to number their

01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:26.780
Final Fantasy games anymore.

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:27.280
Who knows?

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:33.260
So yeah, and I agree Phoenix 14 is still going too strong.

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.420
No need to kill it and pull an Overwatch one.

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.460
Well, to be fair, 11 is still going.

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:42.860
I don't know if I would say strong, but it has people that love it very much and are

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:43.820
still showing up to play.

01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:49.420
So even 11, you know, just a new MMO coming out doesn't negate the other necessarily.

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:55.260
But yeah, anyway, let's move on to whenever Elder Scrolls 6 finally comes out.

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.780
Many people I'm sure will stream it.

01:36:57.420 --> 01:37:00.140
And so we always watch what's going on in streaming communities.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:00.860
Right, Dark Sakura?

01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:02.700
That we do.

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:05.260
And it's not the best news.

01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:10.220
Well, I mean, if you're, you know, everybody except partners.

01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:22.540
So there is this hype chat thing coming where basically you can pay to have your chat highlighted,

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:27.500
like pinned for a bit, you know, to guarantee that it'll be seen.

01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:31.660
And you're basically buying your chat message.

01:37:31.660 --> 01:37:33.180
This is not a new idea.

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.500
This has been happening on YouTube already.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.100
I was gonna say, this sounds like super chats.

01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:38.240
Yeah.

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:40.220
They're calling it hype chat.

01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:44.700
So you can pay anything between $1 to $500.

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:49.740
You can set a minimum of up to $100.

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:55.420
And so depending on how much you pay, depends on how long it stays up as well as character

01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:56.780
length in the visual design.

01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:09.900
And this also gives the streamer a share of the revenue from the hype chat.

01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.020
I don't know what that share is.

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:18.060
But I don't know what they're thinking.

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.700
They're not making this a friendly environment.

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.180
And then also though, and now this is slightly okay.

01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:34.540
They're working on a new range of labels and tags to better identify the kind of mature

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.860
content that's being displayed.

01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.780
So I mean, like for right now, it just had mature content and it could be anything.

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:46.700
So the new levels are going to be mature rated games, sexual themes, drugs intoxication,

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.060
or excessive tobacco use.

01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:49.900
Why is that?

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:50.620
Whatever.

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:56.940
Anyway, violent or graphic depictions, significant profanity or vulgarity and gambling.

01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:08.700
These are basically, they're not going to get people away with breaking the rules, but

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:15.740
these are out there just as general warnings for anyone who might peek in.

01:39:15.980 --> 01:39:20.620
If the game has that kind of content in it, not necessarily the streamer.

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:29.660
So there's a lot of, what's the word I'm thinking of?

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:34.780
A lot of false reporting that goes on too, like retaliatory.

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:41.340
That I think they need to look a bit more at the current system of reporting and action

01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.740
rather than adding more labels.

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:56.140
So anyway, I'm not going to kick because it's very abusive toward anyone who's basically

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:59.180
not, you know, straight sister white.

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:08.940
But I don't know, I won't say anything else about it.

01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.060
I have feelings, that's all.

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:10.940
I have feelings.

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:15.660
No, so I don't think kick is, I've said this on the show previously.

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:21.180
I think last week, until there's an adult that's clearly in charge of kick, and it looks

01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:22.300
like an adult is running it.

01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:25.500
I'm not really interested right now.

01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:31.660
It just seems a little bit like it feels like the ball pit at Dashcon right now.

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:33.260
And that's not a place I need to be.

01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:35.820
Somebody peed in that thing.

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:36.940
You know it.

01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.100
The ball pit at Twitch was better.

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:42.860
It had a mac and cheese in it.

01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:44.140
Yeah, that is true.

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:48.060
Let's see other stuff in chat.

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:56.140
Mike Deft by Black Wolf, a few people pointing out that that split on the hype chats is 70-30

01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.380
plus a 5% fee.

01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:04.460
It just seems like a lot of, you know, like, why do I need to hype that?

01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.500
Yeah, it's a money grab.

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.420
I'm not going to encourage people to buy that.

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:09.900
I mean, if at the end of the day, it's your money.

01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.580
We're not partners anyway.

01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:12.300
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.900
It's only partners, not affiliates.

01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:14.620
That's right.

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.300
So yeah, it is.

01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:17.660
It is a little silly in my opinion.

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:23.900
No one I know that's a partner would do that other than a joke.

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:24.400
Yeah.

01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:28.540
Bobby in chat says the content warnings are fine for me on Twitch.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.860
It helps advertisers target ads better.

01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:35.020
The stuff about excessive drinking and smoking is about excessive drinking and smoking on

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:35.660
stream.

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.060
Taking a sip of beer doesn't need the content warning.

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:39.500
Doing a drunk show would.

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:43.100
And I'm assuming that's similar to there's a difference.

01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:45.740
I wasn't talking about the drinking aspect of it.

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:49.820
Yeah, but I'm going to assume there's also a difference between somebody who does this

01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:54.860
and has a little whiff of a pen once in a, in a, in a great while.

01:41:54.860 --> 01:42:00.540
And somebody who's like fully got their bong out, taking hits between answering Q and A.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.980
Like they just, they need to define it clearly.

01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:04.620
Yes.

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.020
Yes.

01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:06.140
Leaving it so subjective.

01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:06.780
Exactly.

01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:07.260
Exactly.

01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:09.580
So are they saying that Doug Benson isn't welcome on Twitch?

01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:13.180
Because they specifically said tobacco.

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:15.820
And I'm sorry, I know chain smokers.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:16.540
Yeah.

01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.540
Who will chain smoke during their stream?

01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:19.040
Yeah.

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:21.900
So what's, what's excessive?

01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:23.180
What's the definition of it?

01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:26.700
Are they smoking like five packs in an hour or what?

01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:30.860
I mean, that's, and it's a elaboration, but still.

01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:35.740
Oh, apparently MJ always needs the content warning, even if it's just a small hit.

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:36.300
Interesting.

01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:43.980
Cause a lot of DVD streamers I watch partake in between or even have channel rewards to partake.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:47.820
So that's very, I mean, granted, if they're streaming DVD, it's already

01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:51.500
a restricted channel because they're playing an M rated game.

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.540
So that's interesting.

01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:59.580
But yeah, I think there's too much subjectiveness as stark Sakura put it.

01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:02.620
I think there's, they're going to need to clearly define those lanes.

01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.380
And for the love of God, get your affiliates and

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:11.500
partners to the table to help you in defining those lanes.

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.540
Oh, you know, they're not going to, I mean, now here's the thing.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.780
I'm, I'm a member of Twitch RPG.

01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:23.820
And I haven't really seen a whole lot being done with that.

01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:26.940
You know, I do my surveys when I get them.

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.740
Oh, we'll, we'll give you a hundred bits to do this survey.

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:36.860
But there's, they're not like super in depth, you know, not,

01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:41.580
not a really big survey or a deep dive into things that people might want to see.

01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:44.780
And they're missing an opportunity with that.

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:45.920
Yeah.

01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:52.540
Bobby is copy pasting some stuff from the fact that apparently does try to draw the

01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:57.260
lanes a little more on what exactly alcohol use is, you know, smoking a cigarette and

01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.340
all of that is, but even then they say, okay, for alcohol use, sipping on a drink

01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:05.820
while streaming wouldn't require a label, but apparently appearing visibly intoxicated to

01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:09.980
the point you are slurring your speech or making being drunk the focus of your stream.

01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:12.540
For example, doing a drunk history would require a label.

01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:15.500
I still say there's a lot of interpretation in there.

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:16.060
I get it.

01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:19.580
It does sound like one extreme or the other, but what if it's not one of the extremes?

01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:23.180
Who's to say what visibly intoxicated is?

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:28.620
And again, there's been plenty of false reports for other issues.

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:29.120
Yeah.

01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:35.420
You know that I, I, they're going to need to step up their moderation staff.

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:39.980
And then of course, make sure their moderation staff is trustworthy.

01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:40.940
Yeah, for sure.

01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:43.500
I mean, cause we we've heard that incident.

01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:44.860
All right.

01:44:44.860 --> 01:44:45.980
Let's move on to our next story.

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:47.420
I've take a quick, quick AFK.

01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:49.420
I'm sorry, but, uh, Loki, you want to take the next story?

01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:51.020
Yeah.

01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:57.340
This is not really surprising at all, but considering the whole, uh, situation with

01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:01.580
E3 and the sudden cancellation in, uh, 2023.

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:08.940
Well, now it's coming out that according to information from the Los Angeles city tourism

01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:15.180
board of commissioners held its regularly scheduled meeting and announced updates on

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:22.220
tourism and whatnot, and basically said that it didn't sound like that E3 was happening

01:45:22.220 --> 01:45:26.060
in 23 or 2024 and 2025.

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:36.300
Um, and apparently, uh, the ESA has come out to say, ESA is currently in conversations

01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:41.980
with ESA members and other stakeholders about E3 2024 and beyond, and no final decisions

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:43.900
about the events have been made at this time.

01:45:43.900 --> 01:45:47.980
That doesn't say that they, that's not a yes that we're doing it next year.

01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:57.340
So, um, I would assume that, you know, Los Angeles being the host city of E3 would be

01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:59.180
aware whether they're doing it or not.

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:05.340
Um, as of right now, I wouldn't be surprised if it's canceled going forward.

01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:10.300
I mean, honestly, I mean, there is no excuse this year aside from everybody dropping out,

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:14.860
I guess, I guess that's excuse enough, but I don't see everybody just all of a sudden

01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:16.220
jumping on next year.

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:18.460
I don't think anything's going to change.

01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.580
So I think they're done.

01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:25.100
Um, Bobby and point, uh, Bobby and chat says this only means they're not doing E3 in LA.

01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.460
It could be done elsewhere.

01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:27.100
That's true.

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:28.460
It could be done elsewhere.

01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:29.420
Go back to Vegas.

01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:30.140
Yeah.

01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:31.900
Why are we giving the ESA this much credit?

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:35.180
I don't E3 is done.

01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:35.900
E3 has done.

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.780
E3 has been done.

01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:38.460
It's here now.

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:45.180
Now the question is, how does it evolve with this whole partnership for the E3, as you

01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:48.780
used to know it, as you used to attend is done is done.

01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:50.380
It's been done for some time.

01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:56.140
However, that name, you know, if we know, read pop, getting the rights to the name and

01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:58.780
all this stuff, we know read pop also runs packs.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:05.980
I think there's a very clear way that the E3 kind of what everybody thinks E3 is and

01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:09.180
what packs really is, is kind of merged together.

01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:15.500
And I think what we used to know is E3 ends up effectively becoming packs Southwest or

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:15.740
something.

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:16.380
No, it's not packs.

01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.540
Southwest used to be like Texas, right?

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:22.700
I don't know, packs Pacific or something, which is packs prime, but I feel like there's

01:47:22.700 --> 01:47:26.220
going to be either a Vegas or an LA type of packs.

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:31.180
And that's, you know, what essentially, you know, that time of year in E3 ends up turning

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:34.380
into, uh, where maybe even as either.

01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:39.980
And I think I said this way back then, as I said, the first year it will be packs presents

01:47:39.980 --> 01:47:40.940
E3.

01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:43.900
And then after that year it will be E3 featuring packs.

01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:51.740
And that's, that's where, and then it will be E3 in Boston, E3, you know, yes, ironically

01:47:51.740 --> 01:47:53.980
E for all at the end of the day.

01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:54.460
Yeah.

01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:57.180
So that's where I think it goes.

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:59.260
And it's because of the read pop connection.

01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:03.580
That's why I'm drawing that line because effectively read pop will own packs.

01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:06.300
And then they're also going to have the rights to the E3.

01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:12.540
So I think they inject that E3 stuff into packs, but it ends up being that what, what

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:18.140
this is basically what the fuck is packs had to do with penny arcade for a long time now.

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:21.180
So at some point it will just be E3.

01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:25.420
And they already have like each featuring the packs board game lounge.

01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:29.020
It's just like, it's, it's not really adding anything.

01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:31.020
It's not like they're going to have word gaming content.

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.340
It'd be just basically what it was before.

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:38.940
By doing that, here's the thing, the ESA still wants to get membership dues.

01:48:39.580 --> 01:48:42.780
That's why they're not going to know that I am being 100% legit.

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:50.220
So E3 is going to say, Oh, this is going to make it more attractive for the gaming companies

01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.100
in that region.

01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:56.300
And that's why I think there will be an LA San Diego or Vegas version of packs at some

01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:00.860
point because of the game companies in that area, I guess you could do San Francisco as

01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:01.580
well.

01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:05.180
So somewhere, you know, Silicon Valley, San Jose even.

01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:09.740
So somewhere I that's just why I see like a packs California or Vegas type of thing

01:49:09.740 --> 01:49:15.100
happening because now that the ESA will have a stake in this, essentially the ESA will

01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:15.580
have a stake.

01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:22.460
And they'll be like, Oh, well, by you being in the ESA, we want you to exhibit at E3 what

01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:27.020
used to be packs and try to draw more big name.

01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:33.340
When packs has always been about indie, it was some big name sometimes, but try to use

01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:36.300
that power to pull in more big boosts at your packs.

01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:39.740
They can try.

01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:42.780
Yeah, we'll see.

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:44.060
We'll see what happens.

01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:48.940
So Pirate Pound Town in chat says Santa Clara, better venues.

01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.620
I don't know if there's anything there that's big.

01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:53.820
And honestly, even though I say San Jose, I don't think there's anything big enough.

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:56.940
Even the San Jose is probably not big enough for something.

01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.020
Well, if it holds Fanime, it can probably hold E3, but it just depends.

01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:02.620
It depends how big they want to go.

01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:09.180
I just I think Vegas is the obvious cheap convention city, but San Diego is pretty good

01:50:09.180 --> 01:50:09.420
too.

01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.100
It's just San Diego can be kind of expensive.

01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:16.380
So I can see them, you know, putting it somewhere.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:26.140
Okay, moving on, let's get to our next story, which has to do with Quake 2.

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:30.700
Not one, not three, you know, the good ones, but Quake 2.

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:39.420
Apparently, a game rating and administration committee in Korea has rated Quake 2 remastered.

01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:41.420
Well, this hasn't been announced yet.

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:46.460
This is also, by the way, how Quake remastered was announced before it was actually announced

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:47.420
in 2021.

01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:53.260
Just an interesting aside, QuakeCon is coming up in August in Texas.

01:50:54.060 --> 01:50:59.020
So if there's any legitimacy to this, which there probably is, then you're going to hear

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.300
about it at QuakeCon in August, which you probably will.

01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:05.660
So look forward to a Quake 2 remastered.

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:06.060
You know what?

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.220
It is a good chance for that game to get a second chance.

01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.660
I know I kind of, you know, make fun of it a little bit, but it just didn't play quite

01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:14.620
the same as the first, you know, and it did a different thing.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:17.420
But maybe going back and remastering it, you kind of revisit some of that.

01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:19.500
And, you know, it's been a long time.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.860
You take another look at it.

01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:27.740
All right, speaking of classics, I think it's time for an old favorite segment here on our

01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:28.460
program.

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.500
So let's roll the bumper.

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:45.500
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.820
out a classic and tell you about it.

01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:50.460
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:54.700
And what did you pick for us tonight, DarkSagra?

01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:58.540
I picked a game called Last Resort.

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:03.100
It is a horizontal shooter by SNK.

01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.220
The arcade release was out in 1992.

01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:13.980
Of course, it got a port for the home Neo Geo and Neo Geo CD systems and several other

01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:16.700
rereleases, and I'll be getting into that momentarily.

01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:24.620
The point that I want to bring up just to start off with has to do with the development

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:32.780
and the reason why some things may look kind of familiar, like as in R-type like, is because

01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:36.700
Last Resort was developed by former IRM staff members.

01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:41.500
And IRM did, you guessed it, R-type.

01:52:42.300 --> 01:52:49.260
Anyway, so you basically have to blast through five different stages twice and destroy the

01:52:49.260 --> 01:52:55.100
end boss by aiming at their weak points.

01:52:55.740 --> 01:53:06.700
So you have a cyber jet and then a robot drone that you can use as a shield and also as an

01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:12.060
additional weapon with multi-fire and concussion launch capabilities.

01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:19.820
The drone can be toggled to be in front or behind, and behind it can be a cyber jet that

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:26.380
can be upgraded with three types of firepower and faster jet speed by getting different

01:53:26.380 --> 01:53:27.020
power-ups.

01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:31.020
It's basically the R-9 from R-type.

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.220
I'm just going to say that right now.

01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:42.540
So basically, the plot of it is that this computer virus has infected the primary computer

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:50.860
that runs the first space station, and so it's basically brought up its automated defensive.

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:59.580
And so now the computer is attacking Earth and you have to stop the computer by fighting

01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:02.300
its drones and whatnot.

01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:11.260
Anyway, it got really positive reviews from seven reviewers and Gamists in 1992.

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:21.500
Game Machine listed the game on their May 15, 1992, as the 13th most popular arcade

01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.380
software at the time.

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:27.900
Replay also put it up pretty highly, very positive reviews overall.

01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:31.420
And yes, lots of people comparing it to R-type.

01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:39.500
And also, there have been visual comparisons to Akira, the film from 1988.

01:54:41.340 --> 01:54:44.860
And I can definitely see it in some of the aspects.

01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:53.180
It just really had some great qualities to it.

01:54:53.260 --> 01:55:06.060
However, the AES conversion was pretty much turned down because of some slowdown and

01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:13.100
shorter length, because, I mean, of course, the hardware was meant to handle the same

01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:14.380
thing the arcades could.

01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:21.020
But the graphics, the music two-player mode were all considered really great, but the

01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:26.300
lack of also the additional stage and, of course, the slowdown still got further scores

01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:27.740
lower.

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:36.060
One thing that was praised was the power-up system was a mixture of R-type and forgotten

01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:36.540
worlds.

01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:42.380
However, again, slowdown still, still, still.

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:49.340
And it was even being compared to the shooters on the Super Nintendo as far as the console

01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:49.900
slowdown.

01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:01.980
But I mean, overall, it was considered just a really, really visually stunning and audio

01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:03.580
stunning game in the arcade version.

01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:06.140
What is still popular.

01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:11.900
We're also, I think there's, I've seen recent re-releases come out for it.

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:20.060
But as far as other versions, of course, we had the Neo Geo arcade, the MVS.

01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:23.180
We've had the Neo Geo AES, which is the home one.

01:56:23.180 --> 01:56:25.180
We've had the Neo Geo CD.

01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:31.900
We've had SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 for PS2, PS Portable, and Wii.

01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:37.260
And then ACA Neo Geo for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:46.060
I also think that I got a thing through my Prime gaming account that it was one of the

01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:48.060
SNK games they were giving out for free.

01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:56.380
So, but yeah, I mean, it's really straightforward.

01:56:56.380 --> 01:57:04.060
But I just thought that its notability was because of the way that it really portrayed

01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:14.700
the sense of its lore through the environment and graphics, as well as having the benefit

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:17.580
of being by former Irem programmers.

01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:20.780
And I think that's really where the R-Type influence comes in.

01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:26.700
A little bit also like how it also did in Blazing Star and Polestar.

01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.660
Another two of my favorite SNK shooters.

01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:34.460
But yeah, it's Last Resort.

01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:36.460
All right.

01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:37.020
There it is.

01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:40.060
Your classic game of the week, Last Resort.

01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:45.420
I feel like I've put a quarter or two in this machine before, but I honestly had a hard

01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:46.460
time recalling it.

01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:50.940
But yeah, I definitely see a lot of what you're talking about.

01:57:50.940 --> 01:57:54.540
A lot of the R-Type kind of similarities and things of that sort.

01:57:55.420 --> 01:58:00.220
I think they had it for a hot minute back in the day at Crestview Lanes.

01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.180
Oh God.

01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:04.380
That takes me back.

01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:11.580
But I know for a fact that it was, I think what took it over, because I knew they had

01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:14.300
this for a long time, was Blazing Star.

01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:18.940
Which I love Last Resort.

01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:20.700
I think Blazing Star was more fun.

01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:26.140
But I mean, I also would rather play R-Type.

01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:34.460
So it just had that distinction of being like a marriage of titles.

01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:39.420
But it's no less a good game.

01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:45.340
And I think that if you've got Prime or you have other services that will allow you to

01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:47.260
check out this game, you should totally do it.

01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:49.820
It's a good one.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:56.700
Yeah, obviously these Neo Geo games show up a lot on the Prime, and it's a good chance

01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:58.540
to check them all out and take a walk down memory lane.

01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:05.660
All right, well, let's talk quickly about some other headlines going on in the gaming

01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:08.620
industry this week and some rapid fire news.

01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:09.120
Loki.

01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:10.640
Yep.

01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:16.940
So I mean, with the movie right around the corner, the brand new Barbie movie, there

01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:24.780
was a small announcement that the 1956 Chevrolet Barbie movie Corvette EV is going to be in

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:26.140
Forza Horizon five.

01:59:26.140 --> 01:59:27.820
I love this for the record.

01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:35.660
And they also have the 2022 GMC Barbie movie Hummer EV pickup as well that you can drive

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.160
around.

01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:38.300
That's silly.

01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:39.920
Awesome.

01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:40.800
That's great.

01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:43.980
And then let's see.

01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:51.020
So Lies of P and Wong Lo have a partnership going on.

01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:58.060
So I guess that's Wong Lo Fallen Destiny is the Tecmo or Koei, was it Tecmo Koei?

01:59:58.060 --> 01:59:59.020
Koei Tecmo now?

02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:01.360
Yeah.

02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:05.020
So it's Koei Tecmo.

02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:06.940
Yeah, it used to be Tecmo Koei back in the day.

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:17.100
Anyways, they're going to do a little bit of a crossover with during September, I guess.

02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:22.460
And they haven't announced the details yet of what's going to be involved with that crossover,

02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:24.700
but it is something that is coming.

02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:27.420
So souls like combined.

02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:30.540
All right.

02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:32.620
I know a lot of people looking forward to that lies of P game.

02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:33.660
I guess the demo was pretty good.

02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:34.700
It does look interesting.

02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:36.300
Yeah, it does look interesting.

02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:36.940
Dark Sakura.

02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:39.280
Yeah.

02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.380
So anyone remember the toxic, the toxic Avenger?

02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:44.940
Vaguely.

02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:45.440
Yeah.

02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:49.100
Remember that there was a cartoon called the toxic Crusaders?

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:50.720
Yes.

02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:57.180
So it's the original TV series remastering is going to be on Steam.

02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:00.540
The TV show?

02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:01.100
The TV.

02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:10.060
Well, actually they're going to do a scrolling brawler based off of the TV show, which honestly,

02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:15.980
I barely tolerated the movies and I hated the cartoon, so I have zero interest in this,

02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:21.500
but Hey, some people will absolutely love it and more power to them.

02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:25.420
All right.

02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:28.140
I guess you can always check that out in Steam and decide for yourself.

02:01:29.020 --> 02:01:35.020
Um, lastly, Sunsoft is going to be doing a crowdfunding campaign through campfire.

02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:39.100
That's more of a Japanese based website because these are definitely going to be

02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:40.700
Japanese based games.

02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:44.540
Uh, you know, Sunsoft, you might remember from games like blaster master Fester's quest.

02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:46.860
We're not, we're not talking about these games, talking about, you know, games that

02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:51.740
never came over here, uh, to the U S as far as I know, but now the blast master music

02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:52.460
is stuck in my head.

02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:53.020
Thanks, Rob.

02:01:53.020 --> 02:01:53.260
Good.

02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:53.820
You're welcome.

02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:54.860
It's Hey, you know what?

02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:56.300
That's great music to have stuck in your head.

02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:56.780
You're welcome.

02:01:58.540 --> 02:02:02.780
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

02:02:02.780 --> 02:02:02.940
Okay.

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:06.140
Anyway, um, we're going to do for the rest of the episode.

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:06.860
Yeah, absolutely.

02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:08.220
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:14.300
Uh, anyway, campfire crowdfunding campaign will be bringing three Famicom titles to switch

02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:18.940
and PC via steam in celebration of the Famicom's 40th anniversary.

02:02:18.940 --> 02:02:23.500
The crowdfunding campaign runs July 14th through August 31st.

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:26.220
The three titles that they're planning on porting.

02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:34.860
Kanshaku, Tamanege, Kantaro, No Tuikaido, Goju-san Sugi, uh, the wings of, or excuse

02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:40.460
me, the wing of medulla and ripple Island, which I don't think any of those were released

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:40.860
over here.

02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:42.700
I don't recognize any of those names.

02:02:42.700 --> 02:02:46.700
Um, but you know, sunsoft released a lot in Japan that he didn't put out over here.

02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:51.980
Uh, they're also thinking about maybe doing a sunsoft branded golden cartridge that they

02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:54.780
were not able to do back in the Famicom days.

02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:58.860
Uh, only seven publishers back in the day were allowed to engrave their own brand names

02:02:58.860 --> 02:03:00.460
on, on cartridges.

02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:04.300
Sunsoft was one of them, but they were never able to do the gold cartridges because they

02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:05.740
didn't have the budget for it.

02:03:05.740 --> 02:03:09.100
So that's kind of interesting that they might do that after all this time.

02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:13.260
But, um, yeah, if that's of interest to you, you'll have to get on a Japanese crowdfunding

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:18.060
website campfire and take a look for that sunsoft in mid July.

02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:23.580
So anyway, um, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:26.620
of some games you'll be playing a little sooner than this rerelease.

02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:29.020
What's coming out this week in the U S Loki?

02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:31.980
Uh, we have charade maniacs.

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:35.260
No, it is not the brand new, uh, Jack box game.

02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:42.540
It is a visual novel coming to Nintendo switch, a story of seasons, a wonderful life on PC,

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:45.100
Nintendo switch PlayStation five and X-Box series.

02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:51.740
A W fight forever on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four PlayStation five X-Box one X-Box series.

02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:58.220
Uh, Ketsuko, uh, Don she elements with emotions on Nintendo switch.

02:03:59.340 --> 02:04:02.140
Uh, actually, I guess that's a Japan only release.

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:21.900

That is the name of it is also out in Japan this week.

02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:30.860
So, uh, I look forward to that.

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:37.980
And then we also have on the 30th master detective archives rain code out in Japan this week,

02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:42.220

That's all in Japan.

02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:05.420
That is just the switch that I read right there.

02:07:05.420 --> 02:07:07.420
How about the PlayStation five?

02:07:07.420 --> 02:07:08.940

Uh, Chica trees is also out in Japan this week, uh, on the PlayStation five.

02:07:22.380 --> 02:07:24.300
So I told you it was a busy week.

02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:26.700
Uh, so yeah, lots of stuff to look forward to this week.

02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:28.860
Let's go over to Europe, dark Sakura.

02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:31.660
On the 27th.

02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.540
Um, we have a first switch.

02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:40.300
We have story of seasons, a wonderful life for PlayStation below special edition, um,

02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:46.860

Um, for everything AEW fight forever for PlayStation switch and X-Box new, the factionless

We have master detectives, archive rain code, uh, for switch and PlayStation Celeste.

02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:14.220
Um, also for those two, we have a car special edition and goodbye world.

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:16.140
That's not depressing.

02:08:16.140 --> 02:08:22.540
Um, PlayStation shame legacy, the cult edition, uh, switch and PlayStation adventure time

02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:27.580
pirates of the Amchyridion, I guess.

02:08:27.580 --> 02:08:28.380
Yeah.

02:08:28.380 --> 02:08:33.980
Um, also Ben 10 power trip, a hotel Transylvania three monsters overboard.

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:39.260
Then Ben 10 and then transformers battlegrounds where apparently according to the cover,

02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:44.700
they fight for a D 20 and then, um, troll hunters defenders of Arcadia.

02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:49.100
I know it's the matrix, but it looks like a D 20.

02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:52.160
All right.

02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:58.460
Lots of games everywhere going into, uh, what will be here in the U S a long weekend for,

02:08:58.460 --> 02:09:00.700
uh, many folks with the 4th of July.

02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:04.620
I don't know why the rest of the world is so hopping, but yeah, there you go.

02:09:04.620 --> 02:09:05.420
For reasons.

02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:05.980
Yeah.

02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:09.660
So I guess, you know, summertime, uh, you know, all right.

02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:14.060
Uh, let's get into a few more stories and then we're going to open up discord for a

02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:18.540
little bit and see if we can't get, um, some, uh, calls there on discord.

02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:20.780
Uh, let's get to this story from Loki.

02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:22.060
Yeah.

02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:26.460
So I think it was last week or maybe the week before we talked about some of the content

02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.380
being removed from grand theft auto online.

02:09:28.380 --> 02:09:34.060
Well, there's also discrepancies between what is available for grand theft online between

02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:35.660
console and PC.

02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:42.940
And in fact, actually, uh, some of the content that is available on console doesn't get PC

02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:49.340
ports, which is weird because you'd think there'd be parody when it comes to PC and

02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:55.580
current gen consoles, but for whatever reason, for grand theft auto online, they just aren't

02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:56.220
doing that.

02:09:57.020 --> 02:09:59.580
Um, so that's strange.

02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:07.260
They're saying that, of course, you know, um, with, you know, the, like some of the

02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:11.180
different updates they've done with like the Vinewood car club and stuff like that.

02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:16.540
Certain features are only accessible through GTA plus.

02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:24.300
Um, which is of course that paid service that you can get through PlayStation or Xbox, but

02:10:24.300 --> 02:10:29.180
GTA plus is not something that you can subscribe to on PC.

02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:33.580
Probably because people rip all the content out and make it in a mod and stuff like that.

02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:37.660
That's always been an issue with like rockstar games and porting stuff to PC anyways, because

02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:40.620
they're worried that people will mod stuff in the game.

02:10:41.340 --> 02:10:42.620
Which yes, they do that.

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:47.580
Um, maybe not grand theft auto online, but I mean, they probably still would do that

02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:47.980
as well.

02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:56.540
So there is a disparity between what they have on console versus PC, which is kind of

02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:57.500
annoying.

02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:03.580
So maybe there's, you know, that's leading to people to believe that maybe they're going

02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:06.300
to be discontinuing PlayStation online for PC.

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:11.180
I don't think so because I think they make enough in shark cards to make up for that,

02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:16.940
but it is weird to see some sort of like difference in content that's available for

02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:17.260
both.

02:11:22.540 --> 02:11:26.860
So, I mean, how, how mad are you about this?

02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:27.980
Or is it not at all?

02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:29.340
Because I don't play grand theft auto online.

02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:31.980
You're like, you know, give a shit about grand theft auto online.

02:11:31.980 --> 02:11:32.380
No, I know.

02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:37.820
And I think a lot of it is, it's probably going back to, you know, how they're paywalling

02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:43.020
stuff now behind that GTA plus, which is stupid anyways, because like, why?

02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:47.500
Like you don't make billions of dollars off of shark cards already, which you do, because

02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:49.340
we know that because you've said that.

02:11:50.140 --> 02:11:55.340
But like on top of that, you want more recurring like revenue, like through these, the service.

02:11:55.340 --> 02:12:00.060
And why don't you offer that service on, I mean, on console?

02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:02.220
Because I are on PC as well.

02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:07.580
Because I mean, a lot of the new models of cars wherever have already been available

02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:09.340
in game, and then they took them out.

02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:14.220
So this doesn't make any sense that like, you would just now all of a sudden hold that

02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:14.620
back.

02:12:14.620 --> 02:12:18.460
I mean, not that it would be impossible for somebody to rip that data out of like the

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:23.660
console version port at the PC, except probably easily a thing that's being done if it's

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:25.980
anything like four used to be.

02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:30.540
Yeah, I don't know.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:34.700
I don't really understand how Rockstar Games is operating.

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:38.940
I'm curious to see what they do with Grand Theft Auto six for sure.

02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:40.620
Yeah, one of these years.

02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:46.220
This probably this year, because they said they're making a lot of money next year.

02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:49.740
A lot of money that's outside of Grand Theft Auto online.

02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:51.500
So got to be it.

02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:52.620
All right.

02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.020
Let's move on.

02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:55.740
Dark Sakura.

02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:01.020
Well, Sonic stuff is happening.

02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:03.820
And this picture of Lego Sonic is creepy.

02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:08.940
So it's also Sonic the Hedgehog's 32nd anniversary.

02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:14.700
And there was a 20-minute Sonic Central showcase to talk about stuff.

02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:19.740
There is, of course, the 2D Sonic Superstars.

02:13:20.460 --> 02:13:28.620
And there are Sonic Origins Plus, which is expanded version of the original Sonic Origins.

02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:32.380
And it adds Amy Rose as a playable.

02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:38.700
There's a Sonic Frontier, Sonic's Birthday Bash, a Roblox Sonic Speed Simulator,

02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:47.180
Sonic Prime, which is an animated Netflix thing, mobile games getting some updates,

02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:54.300
Samba de Amigo Party Central, Sonic Symphony, which is the touring orchestra.

02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:57.100
I'm trying to see if it's going to be anywhere near us.

02:13:57.100 --> 02:13:59.900
And that's just going to be Los Angeles on September 30th.

02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:05.020
So, well, Tails Tube, which is a series about Tails being a VTuber.

02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:18.540
And then also Lego has a trailer for Sonic Superstar.

02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:23.260
So basically it's Sonic as a mini fig.

02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:26.780
That's kind of cute.

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:29.820
Interesting.

02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:36.460
As Jodhana Matt says, Sonic is 32, nearing its age for its first midlife crisis.

02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:40.700
Yeah, that is nowhere near midlife anymore.

02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:41.340
True, true.

02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:46.140
That doesn't mean we don't have pre midlife crisis around that age.

02:14:47.020 --> 02:14:49.020
I just have constant crises.

02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:53.020
Yeah, I'm constantly in a state of all right.

02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:55.180
I'm internally screaming all the time.

02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:56.300
My soul is hoarse.

02:14:57.180 --> 02:14:59.180
Uh, Loki, what do you got?

02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:00.300
Your grief, I see.

02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.020
Totally.

02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:08.060
I did like, though, that one of the things that they did announce it at that whole Sonic

02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:10.940
event thing was they had more Lego sets.

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:15.340
One of them is like some sort of like Eggman Sonic thing.

02:15:15.980 --> 02:15:17.500
But you know what it looked like?

02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:18.300
It was like ugly.

02:15:19.020 --> 02:15:20.380
It looked like Ugly Sonic.

02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:22.540
Ugly Sonic, the Lego set.

02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:24.220
And I'm kind of all about that.

02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:27.820
That is what freaked me out.

02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:29.020
So I was looking at Fixie's name.

02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:31.340
Yeah, I like that.

02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:35.260
I will be checking that out when that comes into stores.

02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:39.580
Anyways, let's talk about Roblox.

02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:43.900
So Roblox, it's a game for kids.

02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:46.620
Those kids are getting older.

02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:49.420
I mean, my kids have been playing it for years now.

02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:50.780
It's hard to believe.

02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:55.500
And so now because their demographic is aging up, they're starting to look at, hey, you

02:15:55.500 --> 02:16:01.180
know, maybe we should make content that's geared towards those kids that are now aged

02:16:01.180 --> 02:16:02.620
past 17.

02:16:02.620 --> 02:16:07.980
So they're saying right now that 17 to 24 year olds are the fastest growing group on

02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:08.540
Roblox.

02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:13.820
I'm just shocked because they're the group over 18 are playing that game.

02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:16.700
Because they're the group that was 11 when this game first came out.

02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:19.820
I mean, yeah, I guess there's literally people that have grown up with this game.

02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:21.020
That's what it's about.

02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:25.020
That's the cool thing for games to do nowadays.

02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:25.420
You know what?

02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:28.780
Final Fantasy, Death, F Word, Left and Right.

02:16:28.780 --> 02:16:29.340
You know what?

02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:31.580
Roblox, Full Frontal, if that's what they want to do.

02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:34.620
Well, I don't know if they're going that far yet.

02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:36.460
Maybe they'll be the next update.

02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:41.740
But right now they're going to be they said right now they have their they're adding a

02:16:41.740 --> 02:16:43.580
17 plus category.

02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:49.900
And so right now they're 13 plus category may contain moderate violence, light realistic

02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:54.860
blood, moderate crude humor and or unplayable gambling content.

02:16:55.580 --> 02:17:01.580
17 plus category, though, will take it up with intense violence, heavy realistic blood,

02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:08.220
moderate crude humor, romantic themes, unplayable gambling content and or the presence of alcohol.

02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:11.340
Finally, Roblox sounds interesting.

02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:17.580
But they said in order to get access to that, they're going to need you need to submit your

02:17:17.580 --> 02:17:19.980
government ID.

02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:23.740
Oh, forget you.

02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:27.820
Like the fact I have a credit card should be enough to prove that I'm 18.

02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:28.220
Right?

02:17:28.220 --> 02:17:32.940
I mean, obviously, so many kids just take their parents, but still, I'm not I'm not

02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:37.420
submitting anyone my government ID, besides the government.

02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:40.620
Like, you don't need it.

02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:41.820
Yeah.

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:43.020
Tojiki doll in chat.

02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:46.140
Hi, by the way, says, Do they want my Social Security, too?

02:17:46.140 --> 02:17:50.540
Like, honestly, can you read the last three on the back of the credit card and your blood

02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:50.860
type?

02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:53.020
And it's exhausting.

02:17:54.780 --> 02:18:01.740
Yeah, I would just say just if you're going to Roblox and play mature rated games, you're

02:18:01.740 --> 02:18:03.020
better off just try going.

02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:07.100
Yeah, go literally anywhere else on the Internet and you can find because you have to you have

02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:11.100
to understand a lot of these are still made by young developers and stuff.

02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:15.020
And they're not necessarily full fledged games either.

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:17.580
So like, I don't know.

02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:22.140
So it's just the Roblox F word experience where now they can get away with saying fuck

02:18:22.140 --> 02:18:23.500
in a Roblox game, right?

02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:26.540
Kind of.

02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:26.780
Yeah.

02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:27.660
All right.

02:18:27.660 --> 02:18:29.500
Roblox gets its very own fuck show.

02:18:30.060 --> 02:18:30.460
Love it.

02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:31.580
All right.

02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:39.660
Well, where Roblox opens its doors to keep on growing, one game is finally shutting down.

02:18:39.660 --> 02:18:40.620
That's right.

02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:44.540
One of the oldest MMOs, although actually, this game is so old.

02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:45.820
Don't you mean a visual mud?

02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:49.100
Yeah, it's well, if you didn't cut me off, I would have got there.

02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:56.700
But yes, so it's more instead of an MMO, it's more what was a graphical interpretation of

02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:57.260
MUD.

02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:03.340
It's a game known as the Realm Online, and it's finally going to be shutting down after

02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:05.980
27 years.

02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:10.780
This game was launched in the 90s, and it's finally going to be closing.

02:19:10.780 --> 02:19:17.500
And yeah, this game is where we got things like Ultima Online, EverQuest, and then obviously

02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:24.060
those evolved into Final Fantasy 14 and wow, which will eventually evolve into the holodeck.

02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:27.420
But yes, the Realm Online is kind of where it all started.

02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:30.860
I can't really say because I mean, if you think about it's a graphical MUD, well, then

02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:33.420
there were MUDs that inspired the Realm Online.

02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:39.260
But if you don't know what like a MUD or a multi user dungeon is a lot because I used

02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:43.900
to play a couple of these in college, many of them were text or they are really text

02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:45.260
based or ASCII art.

02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:47.660
Yeah, it was like as far as you could get with those.

02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:49.980
But this took it a step further.

02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:54.060
I think of BBS door games.

02:19:54.700 --> 02:20:00.380
And when we first started to see clients, well, I remember the pit distinctly was the

02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:07.260
one that had a graphical client then that you could launch to play the pit in the graphical

02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:10.060
client like this is kind of like that for MUDs.

02:20:10.060 --> 02:20:14.300
But anyway, this yeah, this game is very, very old.

02:20:14.300 --> 02:20:20.060
And after all of this time, it was posted on the Realm Online forums on Wednesday, June

02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:23.660
21st, that the shutdown will be occurring.

02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:27.900
We are sad to inform you of a sudden and unexpected end to our journey together.

02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:33.500
The current agreement we have with Norseman Games gives us no path to acquiring the IP.

02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:39.340
This impedes our ability to direct more money into developing content of the game.

02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:43.180
So the game servers will be shut down on June 30th.

02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:48.540
So that's like that's about as much notice as Paramount Plus gave Queens of the Universe

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:49.660
and Star Trek Prodigy.

02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:58.140
It's it's these are very fast polls, but also the financial year for many, many companies

02:20:58.140 --> 02:20:59.420
starts July 1st.

02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:02.620
And that's why this timing usually is what it is.

02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:05.180
So very sad.

02:21:05.180 --> 02:21:07.100
You have a few more days to check it out.

02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:12.300
Otherwise, I guess it will live on in YouTube contents or it will just grow underground

02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:14.380
as some of these things tend to do.

02:21:14.460 --> 02:21:19.820
Hello, Phantasy Star Online blueburst and that sort of content.

02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:22.380
So a lot of times these things have been going underground.

02:21:22.380 --> 02:21:29.580
So all right, we are to the part of the show where we invite y'all to participate with

02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:36.220
us via email via Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, and you can join our green

02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:36.620
room.

02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:38.220
I do see we have somebody waiting.

02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:39.340
I just want to check real quick.

02:21:39.340 --> 02:21:43.100
I don't think we have emails tonight, but I just want to check in and kind of ping that.

02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:46.060
We had one.

02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:46.620
Oh, we do.

02:21:46.620 --> 02:21:46.860
Okay.

02:21:46.860 --> 02:21:47.360
Yay.

02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:48.460
Yeah.

02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:49.980
And I need to call it out.

02:21:49.980 --> 02:21:52.860
Thank you, fifth dream for sending me a picture of a cat.

02:21:52.860 --> 02:21:54.140
Oh, yay.

02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.580
Okay, that's right.

02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:57.180
This is a picture of a cat.

02:21:57.180 --> 02:21:58.220
Her name is Echo.

02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:00.380
Her favorite video game is Stray, probably.

02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:03.660
Echo has been downloaded.

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:12.700
And when I have more photos, ahem, people, then there will be an update to the cat preview.

02:22:13.020 --> 02:22:16.460
And maybe other animals might be included.

02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:17.420
Let's see.

02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:20.220
I just wanted to make sure that I would love a ferret.

02:22:20.220 --> 02:22:28.060
Um, we got this dreams cat a little bit of love there.

02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:29.100
So there you go.

02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:30.940
I don't want to beauty.

02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:32.380
I want to boop the nose.

02:22:32.380 --> 02:22:34.540
Yeah, that's a very boopable nose.

02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:37.500
Sorry, I took that down real quick because I realized the background is still visible.

02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:41.180
Now there's anything that protected in there, but I just yeah, you don't need to see how

02:22:41.180 --> 02:22:43.180
many unread messages I keep in my email.

02:22:43.180 --> 02:22:46.300
All right, um, let's move on.

02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.380
Oh, I've seen your desktop, Rob.

02:22:48.380 --> 02:22:49.180
I'm not surprised.

02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:51.100
All right.

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:52.620
Excuse me.

02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:53.820
We have a caller in the green room.

02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:55.580
I would love to bring them on and have a chat.

02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:59.260
So let's do just that and welcome them onto the show.

02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:01.260
Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:01.760
Who's this?

02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:04.940
Hi, it's your neighborhood Fixie.

02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:06.060
Hey, Fixie.

02:23:06.060 --> 02:23:06.860
How are you?

02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:10.460
Fixation Gaze here on Twitch.television.

02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:11.260
How are you today?

02:23:12.460 --> 02:23:13.580
I'm doing fantastic.

02:23:13.580 --> 02:23:15.180
I have finally gotten over my cough.

02:23:15.180 --> 02:23:17.660
And so now I sound like a normal person again.

02:23:17.660 --> 02:23:19.900
I'm really worried about you too.

02:23:19.900 --> 02:23:22.140
I'm there with you a little bit.

02:23:22.140 --> 02:23:25.420
I don't think I had what you had, but I've been sick for like the last three weeks.

02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:29.580
I still cough every now and then, but it's finally like, finally, they gave me a stronger

02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:30.860
antibiotic this week.

02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:33.660
And it actually helped this time.

02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:34.380
So it's nice.

02:23:35.580 --> 02:23:37.740
Yeah, no, I had a really weird cough.

02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:41.580
And then it turned into like an almost 104 temperature.

02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:43.260
I just took some NyQuil, went to bed.

02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:45.100
I don't have the insurance for that.

02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:46.620
Oh, golly golly.

02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:47.900
I'm doing much better now.

02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:53.340
Today, I wanted to bring forth a bit of a philosophical question about video games

02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:54.460
and the future of them.

02:23:55.020 --> 02:23:56.140
Okay, go for it.

02:23:57.660 --> 02:24:04.380
So with the rise of movies, you see like the Mario movie, the Sonic movies, which have

02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:09.580
been questionably successful, even Dead by Daylight is throwing itself into the movie

02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:12.540
ring with a Blumhouse movie coming out in the next few years.

02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:14.380
Five Nights Around the Corner.

02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:16.300
Yeah, lots, lots of this video game media.

02:24:16.300 --> 02:24:16.800
Yeah.

02:24:17.740 --> 02:24:21.260
I feel like there's going to be a renaissance that's going to happen that sort of happened

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:26.220
to the tabletop community when Stranger Things was like, cool, look, D&D is fun.

02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:29.660
And it's going to be a big like, like, how do you think that's going to happen in the

02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:34.300
way of like, normal, quote unquote, normal people who are not in the gamer lifestyle,

02:24:34.860 --> 02:24:38.380
seeing games from a different perspective from the movie perspective, kind of like the

02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:43.660
FNAF movie is going to do inevitably, and coming into these spaces, not really knowing

02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:48.540
what's going on, and the amount of gatekeeping that is going to sadly happen, because it

02:24:48.540 --> 02:24:51.740
seems that that's the way that this is going to kind of go.

02:24:52.300 --> 02:24:56.140
Look what happened to the comic industry with all the new people wanting to catch up on

02:24:56.940 --> 02:25:02.140
uh, Marvel storylines and how com- they're convoluted, okay?

02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:02.640
Yeah.

02:25:03.500 --> 02:25:05.740
It was happening, happening there.

02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:08.780
And of course, oh, I've been a fan before the movies came out.

02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:13.900
Yeah, it's a complicated question of what's going to happen when the gaming community

02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:17.980
and the movie community are going to inevitably kind of mesh together.

02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:22.380
Because sometimes you get really good stuff like the, you know, like, I will say the new

02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:28.220
Mario movie is serviceable, it's okay, but movie critics hated it because it had no quote

02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:32.460
unquote plot and was just a go to this place, go to this place, go to this place, but to

02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:35.660
gamers who have grown up with Mario, that's a Mario game.

02:25:36.380 --> 02:25:39.180
That is exactly what you do in a Mario game, except Peach is there.

02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:42.860
So what do you think about that?

02:25:42.860 --> 02:25:47.260
About the fact that quote unquote, like, normal people who have no idea what these games are

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:51.500
are about to be exposed to different kind of gaming things and exploding in that way.

02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:52.860
You know, I'm stewing on this question.

02:25:52.860 --> 02:25:53.900
This is a very good question.

02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:55.260
I'm stewing on this a little bit.

02:25:55.260 --> 02:26:00.860
And honestly, where my brain is going, is I actually feel like the video game industry

02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:03.980
has already had to start responding to this.

02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:08.700
And what I mean by that is, the video game industry has been forced in the last, I would

02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:13.500
say, five, six years to, for lack of a better term, grow the fuck up.

02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:19.180
And what I mean by that is a lot of what you saw that happened with the Me Too movement,

02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:23.980
and how that ultimately started impacting the game industry, a lot of these horrible

02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:28.540
things that we found out were happening inside game, you know, industry development, and

02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:34.060
some of the work cultures, and some of the workers rights, all of that has been bubbling

02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:36.060
up for the last few years.

02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:37.100
We're not there yet.

02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:42.300
We can't say, we have successfully conquered being an adult here in the video game industry.

02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:47.420
But I think if you look at today, versus what things look like, you know, five, 10 years

02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:52.300
ago, but even like five years ago, or just pre pandemic, quite honestly, I think you

02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:58.380
go like, wow, things have shifted at a rapid or pace than it did in the beginnings of this

02:26:58.380 --> 02:26:58.700
industry.

02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:03.980
Because if you go way back to the beginning of this industry, let's be real, the Atari

02:27:03.980 --> 02:27:09.580
2600, and the Atari development community, and I'm looping any, you know, old school

02:27:09.580 --> 02:27:13.900
cartridge based company game in this was very much a boys club industry.

02:27:13.900 --> 02:27:17.580
I do know there were absolutely important women that contributed but let's be real,

02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:18.700
it was a boys club.

02:27:18.700 --> 02:27:24.060
A lot of those old and not only was it that it was heavily drug influenced.

02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:28.780
A lot of your favorite games were absolutely cocaine influenced.

02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:33.900
Do you think that with the general public actually seeing gaming industry?

02:27:33.900 --> 02:27:35.820
Do you think it would wisen them up?

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:41.420
Or do you think it would just basically be a whole bunch of like, no, no, no, I don't

02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:43.420
want to really want to get into the game side of the community?

02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:48.380
Do you think that the gaming community will actually have to like the gamers who are in

02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:48.860
those games?

02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:52.780
Because you always get your 12 year old cod lobby like stereotype.

02:27:53.900 --> 02:27:57.820
Do you think this is going to change the way that normal like everyday nine to five people

02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:02.220
who don't play video games are going to play or view video games because of the movies

02:28:02.220 --> 02:28:03.020
that are coming out?

02:28:03.020 --> 02:28:04.460
I think it's already happening.

02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:07.180
Yeah, I think some of that shift is already happening.

02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:12.860
But along with that, you just generally have more, you know, when we and I know you're

02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:17.500
younger than we are fixie and but I'm not trying to get an age thing because when I'm

02:28:17.500 --> 02:28:21.980
trying even when even when you were younger, but especially when we were younger, it really

02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:25.180
seemed like oh my god, video games are such a niche thing.

02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:27.180
It's a basement nerd thing.

02:28:27.180 --> 02:28:31.100
Like you see Dungeons and Dragons portrayed in Stranger Things, which you brought up before

02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:32.540
like that's how a lot of video is.

02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:34.620
But now was like that in the 80s.

02:28:34.620 --> 02:28:35.580
That's true.

02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:41.740
But like I feel like really in this day and age, so many there's far less people that

02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:46.460
don't play video games, then do play some kind of video game.

02:28:46.460 --> 02:28:49.340
But you have to meet, you know, Tetris is a video game.

02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:51.260
Pokemon Go is a video game.

02:28:53.180 --> 02:28:55.660
Facebook games are video games.

02:28:56.380 --> 02:29:01.100
I'm trying to think of other huge mobile titles that you know, wordscapes and word word with

02:29:01.100 --> 02:29:03.180
friends are Candy Crush.

02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:04.780
That's what I was trying to think of perfect.

02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:05.660
Those are all games.

02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:11.500
And because of that, the there are more women gamers than men because there are all different

02:29:11.660 --> 02:29:18.540
because on planet Earth, there are 51% women and you know, men, birth assignment rates.

02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:26.620
And so you just have more that play games than you did back in the 80s when it felt

02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:29.420
like it was a social elite type of club.

02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:32.540
So I don't know, I feel like in some ways I'm talking in circles, but I also just kind

02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:38.860
of go like, there's just like the gaming industry, most people are already in it.

02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:40.140
But I do get what you're saying.

02:29:40.140 --> 02:29:44.300
There's also a fine line between like, because when you bring up like the Call of Duty lobbies

02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:46.220
with the 12 year olds and all that, sure.

02:29:46.220 --> 02:29:51.660
There's definitely a fine line between hardcore gaming and casual gaming.

02:29:51.660 --> 02:29:54.540
Like there's still kind of some different camps there, right?

02:29:54.540 --> 02:29:56.940
So does this cause more people to get into hardcore gaming?

02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:02.620
I meet people in real life who think that video gaming is just like cod lobbies.

02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:05.980
They don't actually understand that there's a skill or a talent into it.

02:30:05.980 --> 02:30:10.460
They think it's just like your childish if you play video games and they refuse to change

02:30:10.460 --> 02:30:11.260
that sort of thing.

02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:17.260
But now with gaming becoming prevalent and becoming with like entertainment industry,

02:30:17.260 --> 02:30:22.140
because gaming and streaming is moving towards the entertainment industry and a lot of people

02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:23.900
are starting to notice that.

02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:28.940
So it's going to become something a lot bigger than it is currently now, I think, especially

02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:32.780
if more franchises are making TV shows and movies.

02:30:33.100 --> 02:30:37.420
There's another thing to consider too, is that almost the reverse was happening.

02:30:37.980 --> 02:30:42.220
That video games themselves were becoming more cinematic.

02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:47.820
And so there was a greater expectation for more complicated stories, like the things

02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:50.220
that you would see in a movie or a TV series.

02:30:50.780 --> 02:31:00.860
So with that sort of, I'm going to say genre level crossover, that it's already a natural

02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:01.420
progression.

02:31:02.140 --> 02:31:05.500
It's going to happen whether people like it or not.

02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:10.620
They're going to see this and they're not going to necessarily think, oh, this was a

02:31:10.620 --> 02:31:11.420
video game thing.

02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:18.060
I mean, there will be obvious ones, but they'll look at it and go, oh, it's an action movie.

02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:21.500
You know, have that level of separation in their head.

02:31:21.500 --> 02:31:30.620
I think, though, that since a lot of the older adults today now were growing up with

02:31:30.620 --> 02:31:33.500
gaming, the mindset's there.

02:31:33.500 --> 02:31:41.740
It's not going to be as underground as it was when we were all kids.

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:47.980
Yeah, I think gaming has, in a lot of where gaming goes, you just have to look to Hollywood

02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:51.820
and where the rest of motion picture television industry has kind of gone.

02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:56.620
I feel like gaming's walked a very similar path, but just kind of a few years behind.

02:31:56.620 --> 02:31:59.100
I brought up the Me Too movement and its impact in gaming.

02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.260
Well, that started as a Hollywood thing, right?

02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:04.380
And we heard about all the horrific things that were happening with the casting couches,

02:32:04.380 --> 02:32:05.100
et cetera, et cetera.

02:32:05.100 --> 02:32:07.180
I won't get into it, but you all read it.

02:32:07.180 --> 02:32:17.420
But I feel like gaming is walking down a very similar path as we accept as a consciousness,

02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:22.700
as a social community, as we accept gaming more and more as an art form.

02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:25.100
You know what I mean?

02:32:25.100 --> 02:32:30.940
So it's interesting how gaming has kind of had to grow up along with that.

02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:39.420
So yeah, but it's hard for me to picture like who that is that sees a movie and goes,

02:32:39.420 --> 02:32:43.500
gosh, but I guess it would be like maybe the game that is based on that movie.

02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:46.540
It should have happened with the Warcraft movie.

02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:51.100
If the Warcraft movie had kind of landed bigger is that you would expect that there would be

02:32:51.100 --> 02:32:54.860
people that would see the Warcraft movie and then want to go play World of Warcraft.

02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:57.820
But was World of Warcraft very accessible at that time?

02:32:57.820 --> 02:33:01.660
Or did it have a lot of edgelords that would yell at people trying to do looking for group

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:02.300
type of stuff?

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:07.820
But then maybe that's also part of the reason the movie bombed, except in China.

02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:11.820
One of the other things that I also noticed was we kind of got a little bit of a setback

02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:15.020
in the public eye when it came to the movie Ready Player One.

02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:21.100
Yeah, they really botched that one.

02:33:21.100 --> 02:33:27.260
Yeah, but I will say in like a response to Ready Player One, that Free Guy was a very

02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:33.420
good movie to kind of be like, hey, look, a multiplayer game that's like GTA that actually

02:33:34.700 --> 02:33:39.500
even though there's like the oh yeah, AI consciousness, this guy realizes he's in a game

02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:44.380
and I kind of ignore that in the fact of like, they portray video games pretty good.

02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:47.500
And then of course, they're like, Oh my God, yeah, Fortnite moment in Free Guy.

02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:51.340
But it's a very beautiful story in that way.

02:33:51.340 --> 02:33:56.060
And I think that might have been the kickoff to be like, okay, maybe gaming movies aren't

02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:56.540
so bad.

02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:59.900
And then you got your Sonic movie, and then you got your Mario movie.

02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:03.980
That's it is that gaming movies were always the laughing stock of Hollywood.

02:34:03.980 --> 02:34:05.340
They were always bad.

02:34:05.340 --> 02:34:06.380
They were never good.

02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:11.100
But even yeah, that's a Pikachu came out, though.

02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:14.060
That was before Free Guy, was it?

02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:14.540
Yes.

02:34:14.540 --> 02:34:18.700
Okay, well, then I will take back my claim for Free Guy and say Pikachu move because

02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.660
Detective Pikachu.

02:34:20.220 --> 02:34:22.460
That is just masterpiece.

02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:22.940
Hang it up.

02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:23.580
That's beautiful.

02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:29.980
I will even say, though, that perhaps it was the introduction of successful comic movies

02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:34.940
that led to a natural progression toward video game movies.

02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:43.020
Because I've seen I even though it's not a great movie, I still love the Dolph Lundgren

02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:43.820
Punisher movie.

02:34:44.460 --> 02:34:47.820
And I have seen the old Fantastic Four movie that never got released.

02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:50.220
And it was better than advertised.

02:34:51.340 --> 02:34:52.700
I will also come along.

02:34:52.700 --> 02:34:54.060
I'm really scared of that.

02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:58.300
I'm really scared of it becoming like the next comics of movies.

02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:00.300
Like, because I love comic movies.

02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:01.740
I will never say that I do not.

02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:05.180
But I feel like we're getting a lot of it shoved down our throats in the way of turning

02:35:05.180 --> 02:35:06.380
comics into content.

02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:08.700
Yeah, it's it's as it's.

02:35:10.700 --> 02:35:11.900
Sorry, continue.

02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:13.180
No, no, no, I'm agreeing with you.

02:35:13.180 --> 02:35:13.980
I'm agreeing with you.

02:35:13.980 --> 02:35:15.100
Yeah, it's the same thing.

02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:19.660
Although I also have certain things in that pick about the comic industry itself and what

02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:20.780
they're doing with storylines.

02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:25.100
But yeah, but I'm just scared that suddenly everything all the games that you want to

02:35:25.100 --> 02:35:30.060
see, like instead of because the thing that happened specifically with like, also, oh

02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:31.260
my God, what was that game?

02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:36.220
Neighbor Hello Neighbor, that game that everyone is super excited about because it had a cool

02:35:36.220 --> 02:35:38.780
premise and the game learned with you and it got harder to do.

02:35:39.340 --> 02:35:44.380
They completely bombed it because the developers weren't focusing on the game and on the like,

02:35:44.380 --> 02:35:46.860
getting it out of alpha and finishing it.

02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:51.180
But with the book series and a TV series that wasn't about the game, but about the game

02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:52.940
and franchising and movies.

02:35:52.940 --> 02:35:57.500
And because they were so focused on what they were going to do after the game, they didn't

02:35:57.500 --> 02:35:58.540
finish it properly.

02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:02.380
And that's something I'm scared that developers are going to start to lean towards more as

02:36:02.380 --> 02:36:05.980
they see big studios coming out with movies about their games.

02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:13.020
The other thing that a point out is that this is already though, the model of having a game

02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:18.380
and then bringing out a movie iteration of it was already successful in Japan.

02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:20.380
I mean, most of the time it was animated.

02:36:20.380 --> 02:36:22.700
I mean, how did they finish Danganronpa?

02:36:22.700 --> 02:36:23.660
They did an anime.

02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:32.300
You know, there were various live action versions of movies.

02:36:32.300 --> 02:36:35.260
There was a Galgo 13 movie based off of a manga.

02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:37.420
There were games based off of.

02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:38.940
There were so many different things.

02:36:38.940 --> 02:36:44.220
And then over here, we're finally starting to get why it works.

02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:50.300
But of course, like we always do here and I say we collectively, we shove it down your

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:51.500
throat until you're sick of it.

02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:55.580
You know, just milk it, milk it, milk it, milk it.

02:36:55.580 --> 02:36:58.860
Pixie, you ask a great question that honestly could probably do a whole three hour show

02:36:58.860 --> 02:36:59.820
on by itself.

02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:03.420
But I think I've taken a lot of time on this one for you guys who are all good.

02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:07.260
And but I think what's interesting, too, you know, we talk about, you know, the people

02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:08.860
that see the movies that come to our community.

02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:12.220
I think we have to remember and I think I'm really preaching to the choir here.

02:37:12.220 --> 02:37:14.780
I don't think anyone listening to this program needs to hear it.

02:37:14.780 --> 02:37:17.020
But I think this is a message we need to enforce.

02:37:17.020 --> 02:37:21.420
And as many of us are content creators now and have our own communities, this is something

02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:23.100
to reinforce in our own communities.

02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:27.340
And that is the notion that gaming is for everyone.

02:37:27.340 --> 02:37:32.060
And we shouldn't keep gaming because there is nothing to gain from that.

02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:37.100
The diversity, the various viewpoints, the different opinions, they make gaming and they

02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:39.180
make this industry better.

02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:41.820
And they've continued to make this gaming industry better.

02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:44.140
And they've elevated this as an art form.

02:37:44.140 --> 02:37:50.140
So, you know, if you find somebody out there that is like, hey, I saw The Witcher movie

02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:53.340
or sorry, excuse me, I saw The Witcher Netflix series, and it made me want to play The Witcher

02:37:53.340 --> 02:37:53.820
game.

02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:55.820
And now I'm asking for help on this forum.

02:37:56.460 --> 02:37:57.900
Be nice to this person.

02:37:57.900 --> 02:38:01.420
They're discovering this awesome game that maybe you knew a long time ago.

02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:03.820
But again, I know none of you need to hear it.

02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:09.340
But I think this is just those like tenants that we need to make sure that the cool people

02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:10.700
in gaming are doing this.

02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:12.780
We don't need gatekeepers.

02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:14.060
The gates are open.

02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:14.620
Exactly.

02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:16.460
The gates have been open for such a long time.

02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:21.020
And I don't want this to turn into like, the D&D thing where they got super mad that new

02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:22.220
people were showing up.

02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:24.460
Yeah, because it should be for everyone.

02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:26.380
We are all gamers together.

02:38:26.380 --> 02:38:27.100
Exactly.

02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:28.380
They were newbies once too.

02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:35.260
We all we all didn't loop our killer the first time we all bit dust.

02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:38.620
We couldn't aim the first time we picked up a first person shooter.

02:38:38.620 --> 02:38:41.820
So why bash on people learning and we're not safe.

02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:44.860
That's even threw up the first time we played a first person game.

02:38:44.860 --> 02:38:47.900
To go back to how people would try to discredit Dungeons and Dragons.

02:38:47.900 --> 02:38:51.580
We're not Satan worshippers because that was a narrative they would put out there too.

02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:55.420
And I used to tell my grandmother, I'm going out to sacrifice chickens.

02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:55.820
Bye.

02:38:55.820 --> 02:38:56.460
But guess what?

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:56.960
Guess what?

02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:02.060
Instead of saying Satan worshippers, they say contributes to gun violence.

02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:03.260
That's yep.

02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:06.060
That is the Satan worshippers narrative under a different name.

02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:08.060
Food for thought.

02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:09.760
Yeah.

02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:11.500
All right, Fixie.

02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:12.300
I love the call.

02:39:12.300 --> 02:39:13.020
Thank you so much.

02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:16.700
I hope folks consider giving you a follow on the Twitch.

02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:20.700
I'm sure you will be seen again on Dark Soccer's channel a little bit later.

02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:21.900
At some point.

02:39:21.900 --> 02:39:22.220
Oh, yeah.

02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:23.580
Not tonight, then another night.

02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:24.080
So.

02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:26.380
And we may have a Jay.

02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:27.100
Ooh, fun fun.

02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:28.220
We may have a Shay.

02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:28.700
All right.

02:39:28.700 --> 02:39:29.900
Love you guys so much.

02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:32.940
And happy birthday, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:33.260
Thanks.

02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:34.060
I appreciate it.

02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:34.700
Thank you for that.

02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:36.060
We're gonna go do shots.

02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:36.460
All right.

02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:37.340
Take care, Fixie.

02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:38.300
Yell yeah.

02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:38.800
Bye.

02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:39.740
All right.

02:39:39.740 --> 02:39:42.620
Let's bring in one more caller here.

02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:43.820
Who would like to call in?

02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:46.060
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:46.940
Who's this?

02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:52.780
It would help if I would unmute my own damn microphone.

02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:53.260
It might.

02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:55.100
Hey, Rama.

02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:55.980
It's good to see you.

02:39:55.980 --> 02:39:56.540
How are you?

02:39:57.740 --> 02:39:59.020
Well, I'm good.

02:39:59.020 --> 02:39:59.820
A little tired.

02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:02.940
It's been quite interesting weekend, but you know how we do, you know.

02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:03.340
Uh huh.

02:40:03.340 --> 02:40:03.840
Uh huh.

02:40:04.780 --> 02:40:05.420
What's on your mind?

02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:09.980
Sorry, I don't have the way to juggle the cameras on the fly real quick for the four

02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:10.300
shots.

02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:10.780
So sorry.

02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:14.140
Dark Soccer's Pig Meg will be off screen for just a moment while we talk to our buddy,

02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:15.180
DJ Rama S.

02:40:15.180 --> 02:40:16.620
But what's on your mind tonight?

02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:22.780
Rama, somebody who does this with Skype on a regular, I understand.

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:25.980
Yeah, there's only so much I can do live.

02:40:25.980 --> 02:40:27.420
So what's on your mind tonight?

02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:33.580
A couple of things, but there's something we have to do first before anything else.

02:40:34.620 --> 02:40:36.220
I was hoping it was this.

02:40:36.220 --> 02:40:37.180
I know where you're going.

02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:40.300
Orange Lounge Radio turned 21.

02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:41.020
We did.

02:40:41.020 --> 02:40:42.300
We're old enough to drink.

02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:50.140
Well, that's why I have this big old container here that's equivalent to three smaller containers.

02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:52.700
By the way, did you see that video of yourself earlier?

02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:54.220
DJ Rama S with no gray hairs?

02:40:55.340 --> 02:40:56.620
Yes, yes.

02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:01.100
The young DJ Rama S Chronicles coming soon to Paramount Plus.

02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:03.500
No, Paramount Plus has canceled everything.

02:41:03.500 --> 02:41:04.140
I'm sorry to say.

02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:06.220
Maybe you can get a deal with Pluto.

02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:10.860
Well, they're owned by Paramount, so maybe.

02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:11.360
Maybe.

02:41:13.180 --> 02:41:18.300
I want to say there is an extended version of us dancing in the background.

02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:23.340
It is a part of the caramel dancing sim file, part of Orange Lounge Revolution.

02:41:23.340 --> 02:41:23.820
I remember.

02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:26.540
See, I was trying to find that in the clip because I swear that was the thing.

02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:30.700
But anyway, anyway, please, please do your birthday tribute if you wouldn't mind.

02:41:30.700 --> 02:41:35.260
And I just want to stress for the viewers at home under the new Twitch guidelines and everything.

02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:41.420
Of course, that is just simply Kool-Aid that is in that glass that DJ Rama S is holding.

02:41:42.300 --> 02:41:43.660
Yes, of course.

02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:44.540
It is Kool-Aid.

02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:48.140
Kool-Aid for cool kids.

02:41:48.140 --> 02:41:50.140
Yes, cool kids and mature people.

02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:50.860
That's right.

02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:52.940
Happy birthday to one and all.

02:41:52.940 --> 02:41:55.020
Now, hopefully we'll see you all next year.

02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:56.860
I hope so, too.

02:41:57.740 --> 02:42:01.820
I hope you're enjoying your distilled wheat juice.

02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:03.420
Absolutely.

02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:05.820
I have something to wash it down with as well.

02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:11.580
So which I think that label said Diet Coke, if I read that correctly.

02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:14.060
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:17.100
In a brand in a new limited edition silver can with with.

02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:20.060
Oh, that's the video is getting choppy.

02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:20.940
I can't really see that.

02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:22.620
Anyway, what's on your mind today, Rama?

02:42:23.340 --> 02:42:26.620
Apologies is probably my machine because my machine is wrong.

02:42:26.620 --> 02:42:27.420
I'm fucking with you.

02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:30.620
Damn it, Rob.

02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:33.260
See, I even wore our favorite shirt.

02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:33.740
I know.

02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:38.620
I was going to say the last time I saw you in person, I have an amazing picture of you

02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:39.980
that's floating around Facebook.

02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:41.340
That's you.

02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:43.740
No, it's you eating a piece of cheesecake wearing that shirt.

02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:45.020
It's one of my favorite pictures of you.

02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:49.020
I've seen this when we were at one of those diners off Broadway.

02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:53.180
Yes, we have to do that again.

02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:53.740
We have.

02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:55.340
I know we want to come back out.

02:42:55.340 --> 02:42:56.380
Victoria does.

02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:57.740
Melody would always be down.

02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:01.660
It's just it's just a matter of when and money and time, et cetera.

02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:08.300
Believe you me, I know now there's a couple of things that came up during the show.

02:43:08.300 --> 02:43:14.780
But I want to touch base on now the whole Activision Blizzard King thing and Microsoft

02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:17.580
saying, oh, we're throwing in the towel.

02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:21.340
Everybody's laughing at Microsoft saying you couldn't hack it.

02:43:21.340 --> 02:43:22.540
You couldn't handle it.

02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:28.300
But that's how they're going to end up getting a BK because Microsoft says we're not the

02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:30.940
number one Sony and Microsoft.

02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:33.900
I mean, Sony and Nintendo is they've been kicking our butts.

02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:37.500
So all we're trying to do is step our game up.

02:43:37.500 --> 02:43:38.860
And that's how they're going to do it.

02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:39.100
Yeah.

02:43:39.100 --> 02:43:42.380
No, being coming off as the humble.

02:43:42.380 --> 02:43:44.140
We're just trying to do our own thing here.

02:43:44.140 --> 02:43:49.500
That's that's absolutely the narrative they want, because that's going to make it more

02:43:49.500 --> 02:43:52.060
attractive, like, oh, what harm is it going to be if they get Activision?

02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:53.420
They're not the biggest one in the room.

02:43:53.420 --> 02:43:58.220
That's why Sony is trying to discredit Nintendo as a player in the same game, because

02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:00.700
Nintendo, as we know, doesn't make expensive toys.

02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:01.980
They just make fun toys.

02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:03.100
Yeah.

02:44:03.100 --> 02:44:07.340
So what Sony is the president where he's been flipping back and forth?

02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:08.780
I hate to say it.

02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:16.140
It's his ignorance is going to help be like basically the missing link from Microsoft

02:44:16.140 --> 02:44:16.940
to win this.

02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:18.140
That's the way I look at it.

02:44:18.140 --> 02:44:21.180
Yeah, it's it's going to be interesting how this all plays out.

02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:28.220
But, you know, we've been surprised in this before, so we can't assume anything is science

02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:29.260
you'll deliver just yet.

02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:33.100
And one more thing I want to touch base on.

02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:35.020
I don't fully remember the full conversation.

02:44:35.020 --> 02:44:39.420
I was running back and forth, you know, doing adult stuff, you know, you know, you know,

02:44:39.420 --> 02:44:40.860
happens when you have to be an adult.

02:44:40.860 --> 02:44:47.180
But you have mentioned about how you this PS five has become like your dominant console

02:44:47.180 --> 02:44:51.420
and you move to Xbox downstairs as entertainment console and so forth.

02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:57.900
My brother in Christ, I feel you on this right now.

02:44:57.900 --> 02:45:00.140
My primary system is my Xbox.

02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:01.500
Watch all of my stuff.

02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:02.620
Play all of my games.

02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:11.740
I haven't touched my PlayStation four in about six months, and I just re-upped my PlayStation

02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:13.660
plus because I got it dirt cheap.

02:45:13.660 --> 02:45:18.940
I have a stack of PlayStation games sitting back there, sealed, waiting to go.

02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:25.340
And if I'm not on my console, I'm at this PC, you know, playing some games.

02:45:25.340 --> 02:45:29.500
And I understand people are talking about how, you know, with game pass and the fact

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:35.580
that every Xbox game is going to be on the console and on the PC, you don't need an Xbox.

02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:38.060
I'm like, I look at it this way.

02:45:38.060 --> 02:45:50.860
I can either play, oh, halo at my PC, which is very powerful on my 27 inch, 2K screen

02:45:51.740 --> 02:45:53.420
or and my computer chip.

02:45:53.420 --> 02:46:00.860
Or I can go to the comfort of my bed and relax, play Halo on my 43 inch 4K screen.

02:46:01.980 --> 02:46:04.860
And that's something some people do not understand.

02:46:04.860 --> 02:46:07.420
Yes, I have a high powered gaming desktop.

02:46:09.020 --> 02:46:14.140
The most powerful game that I play on here is Phantasy Star Online.

02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:21.580
If it's not for that, the power behind the system is for multimedia, which some people

02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:22.860
tend to forget.

02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:29.100
So, you know, and it just it you bring up a good point that the right machine is really

02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:34.780
dependent on, you know, let's not forget the series S, you know, in the conversation, that

02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:39.980
is the right choice for gamers that are either on a budget or maybe just don't need the power

02:46:39.980 --> 02:46:43.820
or don't have a 4K TV, which is still the case in some homes and so forth.

02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:46.700
You know, they just that's what fits their needs right now.

02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:50.140
It's just you get the setup that works for you.

02:46:50.140 --> 02:46:54.860
And that's the importance of, you know, when Xbox and Microsoft talks about an ecosystem

02:46:54.860 --> 02:46:59.260
and a gaming ecosystem, that's where they want to lead is, you know, have that system

02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:02.620
through the cloud, through the series consoles, through the PC.

02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:05.740
That's the game that Microsoft really wants to play.

02:47:05.740 --> 02:47:08.460
And the game pass connects all of those things together.

02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:16.060
And that's why no matter what, there will always be an Xbox system, whereas there will

02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:18.220
always be a Microsoft Surface.

02:47:18.220 --> 02:47:24.380
The Surface is there to show what Microsoft Windows can do in any type of environment,

02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:28.220
whereas the Xbox always be here to show what Game Pass can do.

02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:32.860
And honestly, I've seen tech YouTubers do this left and right.

02:47:32.860 --> 02:47:39.500
They try to build a $500 PC that's just as potent as the Xbox.

02:47:39.500 --> 02:47:46.780
The way things are now, honestly, just go get a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X and

02:47:46.780 --> 02:47:47.980
call it a day.

02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:48.620
All right.

02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:51.820
I have already dropped $250 on memory.

02:47:51.820 --> 02:48:00.780
I have dropped over $250 more on a brand new power supply and a brand new all in one

02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:01.260
cooler.

02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:04.540
I already dropped $400 on an RTX card.

02:48:05.500 --> 02:48:09.180
I'm just saying just go with where it's good.

02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:09.740
I get it.

02:48:09.740 --> 02:48:10.620
I get it.

02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:10.940
All right.

02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:13.260
Well, Rama, it's after midnight on the East Coast.

02:48:13.260 --> 02:48:14.140
We got to wrap up here.

02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:15.740
We've had a long show tonight.

02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:17.980
Do you have a final thought for our folks tonight before I let you go?

02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:22.620
If you get the opportunity, go to Japan.

02:48:22.620 --> 02:48:23.500
That's all I got to say.

02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:24.700
I wish I'd love to.

02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:26.540
I'm going.

02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:33.180
I'm taking my passport appointment is Wednesday, and it's a done deal.

02:48:33.180 --> 02:48:33.820
It's a done deal.

02:48:33.820 --> 02:48:35.020
I'm going in December.

02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:36.540
I'd love to meet you there.

02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:37.340
I wish I could.

02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:37.840
All right.

02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:43.900
I'm getting the big enough suitcase, so I will see if I can have a layover in Sac

02:48:43.900 --> 02:48:44.220
town.

02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:45.100
You know, I got you.

02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:45.500
All right.

02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:45.900
All right.

02:48:46.380 --> 02:48:49.260
Even if you have a layover in SF, that's not that far away.

02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:49.820
You know that.

02:48:49.820 --> 02:48:51.420
So let me know.

02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:53.260
Most definitely.

02:48:53.260 --> 02:48:53.900
I got you.

02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:54.220
All right.

02:48:54.220 --> 02:48:54.780
Love it.

02:48:54.780 --> 02:48:55.340
All right.

02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:56.540
Take care, Rama.

02:48:56.540 --> 02:48:57.020
Thanks.

02:48:57.020 --> 02:48:58.220
Thanks for the Kool Aid shot.

02:48:58.220 --> 02:48:58.620
Take care.

02:48:59.340 --> 02:48:59.820
All right.

02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:00.300
Later.

02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:00.800
Bye.

02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:02.540
All right.

02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:04.300
That was lovely.

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:07.260
DJ, thank you so much for giving us a call.

02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:10.220
That is going to do it, though, for the almost said the Skype line.

02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:10.940
You know, I've been doing it.

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:13.660
He brought up Skype during that call, and now my brain's like, oh, that's going to close

02:49:13.660 --> 02:49:13.740
it.

02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:19.100
That's going to close up Discord for tonight as we are here to wrap up here.

02:49:19.100 --> 02:49:21.580
Real quick, Loki, last minute stories we want to put out there.

02:49:22.380 --> 02:49:24.060
Yeah, just had one small thing.

02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:28.140
So apparently it's like this just happened not that long ago, either.

02:49:29.980 --> 02:49:37.100
There was a trailer for a I think it's for the new Destiny expansion, and it featured

02:49:37.100 --> 02:49:39.420
someone else's fan art in there.

02:49:40.220 --> 02:49:40.720
Whoops.

02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:41.380
Jeez.

02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:47.920
And so apparently, thankfully, the artist that made it was just like, well, that's cool,

02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:55.200
you know, but Bungee said that we discovered that an internal or external vendor that helped

02:49:55.200 --> 02:49:57.120
create this cut scene mistakenly.

02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:57.760
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:49:57.760 --> 02:49:59.040
It was in game is during a cut scene.

02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:03.840
OK, so mistakenly used this art as reference, assuming it was official bungee artwork.

02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:08.000
We are currently waiting to hear back from the artists to take necessary steps to remedy

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:08.720
the situation.

02:50:09.680 --> 02:50:13.920
Good, so they're planning to compensate and credit them for their work and pay them in

02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:17.760
like actual government currency artists what they're worth.

02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:23.760
Yeah, not like in-game currencies, give them actual government legal tender currency.

02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:24.820
All right.

02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:30.640
Thank you all so much for downloading or listening to us live tonight on Twitch and so forth.

02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:33.840
I just, you know, again, thank you for taking time out of your week, out of your Sunday

02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:36.400
night to be here and participate along with the show.

02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:37.680
We really appreciate you.

02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:40.160
We wouldn't be here for 21 years if it wasn't for all of you.

02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:41.840
And we just we really appreciate all of you.

02:50:41.840 --> 02:50:44.560
Thank you so much for helping to make Orange Launch Radio possible.

02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:48.480
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, help us spread the spread the word.

02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:49.280
Tell a friend or two.

02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:53.680
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify or wherever you found this show goes

02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:54.960
an awful long way as well.

02:50:57.120 --> 02:50:59.280
Support all of our personal endeavors as well.

02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:02.080
We all of us either Twitch or YouTube or maybe even both.

02:51:02.800 --> 02:51:07.520
So we really appreciate that as well if you consider taking that extra step as well.

02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:10.720
That is going to do it for Orange Launch Radio tonight.

02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:14.880
We'll be back in seven days, of course, to start off, I guess, what would technically

02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:17.120
be our 22nd year in a way.

02:51:17.120 --> 02:51:19.600
But yeah, it's a wild, wild.

02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:21.680
Let's go around.

02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:24.000
Why does this still say DJ Roma S?

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:25.840
See, this is why I shouldn't change shots on the fly.

02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:27.040
It still says DJ Roma S down there.

02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:29.040
Should we say Dark Sakura?

02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:32.400
So if I could type.

02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:33.680
So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.

02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:35.360
My audio is going funky all of a sudden.

02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:35.860
Who knew?

02:51:36.260 --> 02:51:40.420
Well, before we lose you, then let's get your final thought for the night.

02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:46.180
My final thought is stop camping, stop tunneling, learn how to play the fucking game.

02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:49.380
And bring tiramisu.

02:51:49.380 --> 02:51:50.900
It's the anniversary event after all.

02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:52.020
Tiramisu.

02:51:52.020 --> 02:51:54.180
I love that it's tiramisu.

02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:55.460
It's great.

02:51:55.460 --> 02:51:56.740
That just made me giddy.

02:51:56.740 --> 02:52:01.780
Well, tiramisu is my favorite, my favorite dessert.

02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:02.500
It's a good dessert.

02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:04.100
All right.

02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:05.460
Have fun with some Dead by Daylight.

02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:06.340
I know you're off to go play.

02:52:06.980 --> 02:52:08.180
I'll stay fog.

02:52:08.180 --> 02:52:08.500
All right.

02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:09.000
Bye.

02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:11.300
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:17.380
I'm just going to keep grinding my craft and hopefully we'll have some progress shots of

02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:18.100
wooden pinball.

02:52:19.380 --> 02:52:19.780
All right.

02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:20.340
Sounds good.

02:52:21.380 --> 02:52:21.860
Let's see.

02:52:21.860 --> 02:52:27.300
My final thought for the night is I'm going to do, I'm doing this very last minute, but

02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:29.460
tomorrow happens to be my actual birthday.

02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:32.900
I don't want to make a big, big deal out of it, but I'm going to do a little bit of a

02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:33.780
birthday stream.

02:52:33.780 --> 02:52:38.020
I'm not going to beg for subs or anything like that, which I understand is I just want,

02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:39.300
I honestly, I just want growth.

02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:40.180
I want more followers.

02:52:40.180 --> 02:52:42.260
I want, I want, you can pay me an exposure.

02:52:42.260 --> 02:52:42.760
It's okay.

02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:45.860
So I'm going to do just an impromptu birthday stream.

02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:47.460
I'm not going to play 16.

02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:50.900
I'm going to play games that don't have a heavy narrative tomorrow.

02:52:50.900 --> 02:52:53.940
And I'm just going to cycle through some of the greatest hits that I've streamed over

02:52:53.940 --> 02:52:54.580
the last year.

02:52:54.580 --> 02:53:00.420
Things like Dead by Daylight, things, Diablo 4, No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy 14 Endgame

02:53:00.420 --> 02:53:01.860
where there's no story.

02:53:01.860 --> 02:53:04.820
And I'm just going to cycle through and try to do a really long stream tomorrow night.

02:53:04.820 --> 02:53:07.220
So I can spend my birthday with y'all because what else am I going to do with a birthday

02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:07.780
on a Monday?

02:53:08.420 --> 02:53:10.660
So I hope you'll stop by and say hello.

02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:12.740
That's, that's it.

02:53:12.740 --> 02:53:15.060
Twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, if you want to do that.

02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:19.620
Otherwise, that's it for me as well.

02:53:20.420 --> 02:53:21.860
So that does it for Final Thoughts.

02:53:21.860 --> 02:53:23.300
That does it for the show.

02:53:23.300 --> 02:53:27.460
Thanks again for being here and making it a fantastic 21 years.

02:53:27.460 --> 02:53:28.900
Shall we go for 21 more?

02:53:31.060 --> 02:53:31.620
Baby steps.

02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:31.940
All right.

02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:35.700
No, in all seriousness, we will definitely see you again in seven days.

02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:36.740
Have a good week, everybody.

02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:37.620
We'll see you next time.

02:53:37.620 --> 02:53:38.660
Happy gaming.

02:53:38.660 --> 02:53:42.260
And remember, please, please, gaming is for everyone.

02:53:42.260 --> 02:53:43.220
And don't you forget it.

02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:44.020
Have a great night.

02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:44.520
Bye.
