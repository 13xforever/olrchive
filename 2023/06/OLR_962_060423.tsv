0	11560	It's a weird time in history right now.
11560	15040	Writers Guild on strike, League of Legends pros on strike, Rail workers denied the right
15040	18480	to strike, French workers striking, Bobby Kotick claiming there has never been a systemic
18480	22020	harassment issue after paying 50 million to settle claims that they did and didn't have
22020	24040	procedures in place to deal with the fact that they did.
24040	26520	I don't have a solution and won't resort to a pithy quip.
26520	28380	Society is complicated.
28380	29860	Some of these headlines are in tonight's news.
29860	32940	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about
32940	35820	them and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every
35820	37820	gamer has a voice.
37820	44660	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
44660	47140	where every gamer has a voice.
47140	54460	It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 962 of our
54460	58440	program for tonight, June the 4th of 2023.
58440	63580	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here live each and every Sunday night when we record
63580	64940	with my co-hosts.
64940	68580	Say hello first and foremost to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
68580	70580	No, I'm Pigmeg.
70580	71580	Yeah.
71580	74620	So okay, but the people on podcast don't get that.
74620	79180	So you're being represented by a picture tonight because it sounds like both you and I have
79180	80660	had a week.
80660	81660	You start.
81660	82660	Okay.
82660	89100	So I've made it no secret that I have myalgic encephalomyelitis, which is also known colloquially
89100	92940	as chronic fatigue syndrome.
92940	100220	And since starting ballet, I actually ran out of two of my medications and I started
100220	102580	taking them again very recently.
102580	108300	And partly as a result, I'm having dizzy spells after activity.
108300	119460	Not all the time, but I did a combination of like an hour and 15 minutes of yoga, Pilates,
119460	123500	bar exercise, weight training, and my cool down.
123500	131420	So because I mean, I basically do like mixed movement and then bar exercise to try to get
131420	132420	my turnout.
132420	136420	Today was the day I was working on my turnout.
136420	143220	And I sat down for a little bit and just dizzy spell and I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not going
143220	148900	to be able to do makeup or stand up while my hands are shaking.
148900	152740	So I just like, I don't want to be on cam.
152740	159140	So this little avatar I made in Daz 3D.
159140	166860	And I had just put together, you know, kind of a representation of my cosmetic that I
166860	170060	play with Meg in Dead by Daylight, but something a little bit different, but I always use the
170060	171460	pig mask.
171460	177820	So that's actually now my no cam image on my stream, because I use my camera to hide
177820	178820	my perks.
178820	182600	I was gonna say it's big V tube vibes, except the only thing that's missing is bouncing
182600	185540	up and down, like as you're talking and that whole thing, you know, sort of the mouth move.
185540	188460	Well, you wouldn't see the mouth moving under the mask, but maybe like bouncing up and down
188460	189460	or whatever.
189460	193740	The one I'm working on now is going to eventually, hopefully be a Vtuber.
193740	194740	Yeah.
194740	195740	Awesome.
195740	199020	For me, my week, I have been dealing with strep throat actually.
199020	202020	So you're probably wondering what the hell are you doing talking tonight?
202020	203800	Actually I started in antibiotics a few days ago.
203800	205580	My throat is now fine.
205580	210520	What the weird thing that happened is that from strep throat, it now went to what I believe
210520	211700	is a sinus infection.
211700	215580	I can't exactly go to see my doctor on the weekend, so I can't get that properly evaluated
215580	216580	in my own antibiotics.
216580	221540	Anyway, I'm not sure what else they can do, but that is very strange to have a strep
221540	225540	throat because that's not supposed to cause sinus issues, but it's likely that the infection
225540	227700	kind of traveled a little bit.
227700	228700	So that part's kind of weird.
228700	230900	It actually depends on the antibiotic that you're on is why it might not affect your
230900	231900	sinuses.
231900	232980	Oh, interesting.
232980	235700	I think I've taken this for a sinus infection for a Z-Pak.
235700	237700	So it's a pretty common.
237700	238700	Yeah.
238700	244180	I myself, I always start off with doxycycline, but it's always worked for me.
244180	246340	Z-Pak is, well see, I'm allergic to penicillin.
246340	248060	So Z-Pak has always kind of been the first.
248060	249060	Oh, interesting.
249060	250060	Yeah.
250060	251060	So it's that-
251060	252060	And amoxicillin.
252060	253060	Yeah.
253060	254060	Yeah.
254060	255060	Amoxicillin was the one I actually had a reaction to.
255060	256060	So they just say all penicillins.
256060	261900	So Z-Pak and the one you call doxycycline are usually the two go-tos, doxycycline, whatever,
261900	264220	are usually the two go-tos.
264220	266500	Yeah, same.
266500	273460	Actually do you remember when I took amoxicillin and I had that really weird raised skin reaction
273460	275540	that I kept going to the golf club with?
275540	276540	I don't.
276540	277540	It was a while ago.
277540	278540	When I had lucky pneumonia.
278540	279540	That was a while ago.
279540	280540	Wow.
280540	281540	That was a while ago.
281540	288060	I mean, I think it was like 2010, but it itched so badly.
288060	291420	But when I went under the blacklight because I'm so pale, it stretched out my skin and
291420	292420	looked like spiderwebs.
292420	293420	It was kind of cool.
293420	294420	Oh, wow.
294420	295420	That's wild.
295420	296420	Yeah.
296420	297640	No, all my issues happened when I was 12.
297640	302780	I took amoxicillin for something and I got a big rash like everywhere and the doctor
302780	304420	said, all right, no more of that.
304420	305420	So interesting.
306300	308300	It gave me penicillin when I was five and ended up in the E.R.
308300	309300	Oh, my.
309300	310300	Oh, no.
310300	311300	All right.
311300	315300	Well, let's say hello to say hello to somebody who hopefully is happy and healthy.
315300	316300	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
316300	317300	Yeah.
317300	318300	I'm all right.
318300	319300	Yeah.
319300	320300	Good.
320300	321300	Good.
321300	323060	Except why on earth would you have that game playing behind you tonight on stream?
323060	326500	Is that that's one to switch I'm watching behind you tonight?
326500	331700	It is because it's just so that you realize that the game actually exists because I completely
331700	332700	forgot about it.
333060	335260	I mean, we're going to talk about.
337580	342220	Once again, Nintendo deciding to bring a sequel to something that, like, really no one cares
342220	343220	about.
343220	347020	Well, you know what, since you transitioned, why don't we get right into it?
347020	351740	I'll just give my usual spiel because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock
351740	355900	Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash Vogue Network
355900	360500	VOG Network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who is back live tonight.
360500	364900	Bobby Black Wolf, by the way, at Summer Games Done Quick, which will be one of our fast
364900	370340	headlines later, but he really went into depth about being there and his participation and
370340	371340	so forth.
371340	374780	So if you have any type of interest in Games Done Quick and kind of what all happens at
374780	379380	the in-person event because it is back in person, he talked a lot about that on his
379380	380380	show tonight.
380380	382340	So I'll kind of give an extra shout out for Bobby tonight.
382340	385380	Stop trying to make one, two switch happen.
385380	386900	It's not going to happen.
387100	388940	Pretty much that's the that.
388940	391100	Let's get into the kickoff topic.
391100	392100	That is it.
392100	396660	They without any fanfare whatsoever, which is the appropriate amount of fanfare to give
396660	399500	one to switch is literally none.
399500	404620	It is out for preorder now on the eShop for twenty nine ninety nine.
404620	408220	It's releasing June 20th.
408220	411900	I could really just like I don't care at all about this game.
411900	419460	It was an awful game and now it's an awful game with a sequel and.
419460	423940	Like you already have like Wii Sports Resort or like not Wii Sports Resort, the Switch
423940	430280	Sports, which is basically Wii Sports, like you don't need this, like you tried this,
430280	431780	you tried to make this happen.
431780	432980	It didn't happen.
432980	434540	No one really wanted it.
434540	436500	And now you put out a sequel to it.
436500	437500	Why?
437500	438500	I'm like, why would you do that?
438500	444140	I'm legit surprised this didn't go the HBO Max route, shall we say, of quietly disappearing
444140	447380	content into the night and writing it off and never releasing it.
447380	449740	I'm kind of surprised it didn't go that way.
449740	451500	Just, hey, guess what?
451500	457340	You know, now that you pay an extra money for that Nintendo Switch online, thank you.
457340	458340	Thank you.
458340	460340	And then or whatever it is, you expansion pass.
460340	461340	Now you get this piece.
461340	463620	That's exactly what this should have been.
463620	468100	This should have been a free piece of crap for being a Nintendo Switch online member.
468100	470020	That's exactly what this should be.
470020	475000	It could be both because $29.99 is really not that expensive.
475000	479020	But they could say, but you could get it for free with Nintendo Switch online.
479020	480740	But I don't think that they're doing that.
480740	483900	I really just don't see the selling very well at all.
483900	486620	Well, you know what, some folks in chat are talking about that.
486620	491840	Like Mike Deff says, didn't the physical copies for everybody's one, two Switch sell out?
491840	494360	Like it's awful and all, but it is selling.
494360	500440	There is I honestly think it's people that are looking for a fast and easy party game
500440	502940	that get allured to one to switch.
502940	506340	And I wonder if there will be a similar allure for this, except there's no physical edition
506340	507340	for this.
507340	509800	It's not going to be something that tempts them on the Walmart shelf.
509800	514400	Here's the other weird thing about this that I should point out based off of the screenshot
514400	518080	here are the artwork.
518080	521600	Half of the people have switch controllers or joy cons.
521600	525440	The other half of the people on here have cell phones.
525440	529720	So it sounds to me that it's a game that you can play with your cell phone as well.
529720	536280	They have that is confirmed in the description that your cell phone is, which is something
536280	541080	actually I thought was a brilliant move from Jackbox Games kind of brought that to the
541080	543320	forefront several years ago at this point.
543320	545440	And I think that was brilliant.
545440	551000	So I, I'm not surprised to see another company implementing that.
551000	555520	I'm surprised to see Nintendo be that company.
555520	556640	That's the surprising part.
556640	557640	I'm not surprised at all.
557640	559860	Somebody took a good idea and put it in their own game.
559860	564200	I'm surprised Nintendo did that because they're the ones to usually push their own hardware.
564200	571180	But maybe, you know, again, if they're trying to, to me, there's only one market for this.
571180	573000	There's one market for this.
573000	578480	It is somebody who's throwing a party, has several people over, needs a party game everybody
578480	580940	can play and wants something new to play.
580940	582360	And this is it.
582360	588560	And you know, if you didn't have enough Joy-Cons that everybody could play, you would be probably
588560	589780	hesitant to buy it.
589780	593020	But since it works with cell phones, that's not going to be a problem.
593020	594260	Don't you all have phones?
594260	596400	We all know that meme at this point, but it's true.
596400	599180	Like everybody does have a phone at this point.
599180	602940	But you know, don't they have like the Jackbox Games on the Switch?
602940	606460	So like, I would just play that.
606460	609260	You know, Bobby brings up a really good point in chat as well.
609260	614620	There are lots of Switches that don't have Joy-Cons because if you have the, the one
614620	617740	that Alan has, the Switch Lite or whatever they called it, where it was all together,
617740	619120	you don't have Joy-Cons on that.
619120	620900	So you have to have something else.
620900	621900	Okay.
621900	622900	Okay.
622900	626100	I bet you're not plugging into the TV.
626100	629420	So is everyone going to huddle around a little, a little Switch, let me go.
629420	631900	I can't really see the screen because it's so damn tiny.
631900	636940	But yeah, I think we're doing the thing, you know, like I, like I get it, you can play
636940	644500	through your phone and stuff like that, but like, it just, I, I, whatever.
644500	645500	You know what?
645500	646500	Cool.
646500	648140	You wasted development time on this.
648140	653620	This is why I don't get like one, two Switch gets a sequel and gets development time.
653620	659900	Pikmin gets goddamn how many sequels, you know, for that thing, but like F-Zero, what's
659900	660900	that?
660900	661900	Oh, I don't know.
661900	663820	We just don't make F-Zero games here anymore.
663820	669860	Well, the number again, it's not like everybody's one, or excuse me, it's not like the original
669860	671060	one, two Switch didn't sell.
671060	676580	Now I would argue that was because outside of Zelda, there was very little else to buy,
676580	679100	at least, you know, for that party environment and so forth.
679100	682100	And yes, I'm sure you all are going to come at me with the launch titles, but as far as
682100	687220	Nintendo's first party, and they are very good at getting the game out in front of people,
687220	691860	especially when the Switch was new and they made it, you know, they, here's what I asked.
691860	695540	So I see the quote in chat, the 3 million people bought one, two Switch.
695540	698140	How many of those 3 million people regret that purchase?
698140	699740	That's what I really want to know.
699740	704380	How many people are playing that game still, or how many people like purchased it because
704380	708540	they're like, well, there's no like Wii Sports type games, so I'm going to buy this.
708540	711500	Like look at the game that is behind me right now.
711500	714100	Like let me describe for the audio listeners.
714100	716900	It is a game where you have a chess that's wrapped in chains.
716900	720540	You have to twist your Joy-Con around to unwrap the chains.
720540	722020	That looks goddamn boring.
722020	724100	Like I would not want to play that.
724100	725100	It just, it's stupid.
725100	729420	And watching the people like dress up like pirates do it is just cringey as hell.
729420	734420	Let me ask this question, because if there is the cell phone integration, then none of
734420	737540	this stuff with the vibration can be in it.
737540	743020	So I'm going to be, I'm going to ask this question from, I guess devil's advocate or
743020	745040	whatever you want to call it.
745040	750100	Is it possible that them having to make the regular cell phones a controller as well will
750140	754500	actually make the games better because they can't just rely on the gimmicks?
756500	757940	No, I doubt it.
758220	762100	I honestly doubt it, because if they thought it was going to be a good game, they'd be
762100	763700	charging more than $29.99.
764340	768700	They have no confidence on it, so they didn't spend any marketing budget or very
768700	769780	little marketing budget.
770020	771740	It's not even announced in a direct.
772020	777180	It's not even something that they would throw in in their like random like directs that
777180	778540	they were doing, like with indie games.
778540	781980	They're like not even indie games, but like other things like, hey, this is coming out.
783260	787380	Guy, because they can't because they honestly can't say, hey, guys, I know you guys are
787380	790060	waiting for a sequel, the sequel you've all been asking for.
790060	792140	It's like F zero mother.
792140	794260	No, another retro game.
794260	798100	No, any of your excite bike?
798100	798740	No.
798740	799500	Oh, one, two.
799700	801340	Oh, oh, OK.
801380	807020	I yeah, I'm just of the mindset that like rather than release it for $30, I bet more
807020	811020	people would play it if they made it free with switch online, you know, and maybe, you
811020	813980	know, again, it's about making money and they probably figure they're going to get those
813980	818340	switch online dollars anyway, because people are going to pay the online, although Zelda
818340	819340	doesn't really have online.
819340	820180	Right. So they got it.
820180	824980	They got to know they're they're they're maintaining those online fees from somewhere.
824980	826620	I don't know, but OK.
826620	828980	Yeah. Yeah. Bobby saying the games are too expensive.
828980	830020	Here's a $30 game.
830020	832460	If you thought it was good, you'd make it more expensive.
832460	835660	Well, yeah, because I don't want to pay $30 for a crappy game.
835660	838380	I can pay $30 for a good indie game.
838740	841100	Sure. Yeah, I have a lot more enjoyment over it.
841300	844820	Like one to switch is just bottom of the barrel garbage.
844860	849660	This is this is something like if it was literally some other like random third party
849660	853700	company that made shovelware put this out, I wouldn't be surprised that that was from
853700	857860	them. The fact that Nintendo has their name on it doesn't make it a quality game.
857860	859340	It was just not good.
859860	862620	Yeah, well, we'll see when the reviews come out.
862620	868820	But again, I just I don't you know, I say that and I don't usually put stock in in
868820	874580	reviews, but I just feel like a lot of these the lower price tag, which Nintendo really
874580	880300	does, not even being in a direct straight to the store, like all of these signs point
880300	883820	out, this is the equivalent of a Nintendo write off like this.
884060	889260	This is it. They're they're firing this one late into the night and it is what it is.
889620	892260	And I fully expect the reviews are going to say this game is crap.
892980	900300	And we might sound hateful or whatever, but I really think our prediction here is not
900300	901740	without merit.
902100	903460	I don't crap.
904380	907660	If it's not, then what a pleasant surprise that would be, then great.
907660	910700	I would be excited that, hey, it's only thirty dollars.
910700	917140	That's a great deal. But, you know, like Loki points out, even though, yeah, thirty
917140	918460	dollars is cheaper game.
918460	922020	And for the most part, we're happy to see that it's difficult to get excited when you're
922020	925660	looking at Jackbox Games, which the party packs are what are they?
925660	927060	Nineteen ninety nine for the party.
927180	931220	I don't I don't legit know what they cost right now, but there may be 19, maybe twenty
931220	936540	four ninety nine. And I would I would say I enjoyed any of those packs, any of them
936540	937900	better than I did one to switch.
938460	942260	Yeah. You want to get me excited about something that would be like a party game for
942260	943900	the switch and you can involve cell phones.
943900	945540	Make me another WarioWare game.
947100	948740	Could you do that with the cell phones?
948740	951820	And that would probably work for some of the touch screen stuff.
951820	955260	You could probably do little micro games and stuff and send it through there and have
955260	956740	some sort of interaction with that.
957140	960700	But like that's a better franchise than this.
960700	961860	This is just garbage.
961900	965380	This is I just don't see this being a thing.
965380	968220	Actually, you bring up an interesting idea.
968220	974580	Like what if Nintendo were to take the cell phone thing and put it in some other games?
974580	977020	Like I just I think I'm still sitting here shot going.
977020	979540	I just I never saw Nintendo doing this in the first place.
979660	983340	So for me to think like, oh, would they make a WarioWare game that you could control with
983340	985980	your phone? Like I'm like, no, they would never do that.
985980	989380	But I'm like, well, but I didn't think they'd do this either.
989780	996500	You know, could they do something that maybe they try to attract people with phones to get
996500	999580	more of those, you know, party in person type of games?
1000500	1001740	I don't know. I don't know.
1001740	1008460	But the other thing to point out is that we this this release is also surprising because
1008500	1013220	it's literally the only new game we know that's coming for Switch first party right now.
1013700	1016260	We don't know what else is on Nintendo's agenda.
1016260	1022420	So, again, this does feel very get it out there before they're going to reset the palette
1022420	1024860	and tell us the games we're really excited for.
1024860	1026020	When does this come out again, Loki?
1026020	1026540	The end of June?
1027260	1032300	It's on the 20th. And so, yeah, by the time like if they do, probably the next week is
1032300	1033380	when we get a Nintendo Direct.
1033660	1037220	So if we get a Nintendo Direct, you're literally going to forget that this game exists
1037220	1039020	again, like you're going to hear the other games.
1039020	1040020	You're like, oh, cool.
1040020	1042860	You know, I'm gonna look forward to that and then just immediately forget that this thing
1042860	1045060	exists like you did the original one to switch.
1045260	1049220	Yeah. But if the Nintendo Direct is before the 20th, and then we already know we're going
1049220	1055340	to see the footage for this game, which is still a possibility, Nintendo still may just in
1055340	1061540	the. They have to show they're trying to make money and, you know, that build an awareness
1061540	1065780	again, they will probably show some footage for the game and stress the cell phone thing
1065780	1066860	an instant party.
1067340	1072940	If you want to have an immediate party just by this game type of thing, I could see them
1072940	1075540	doing that if the direct is before the 20th.
1077060	1081780	But I still want to know what the hell Nintendo is doing for the holiday.
1081940	1085580	I do not believe there is nothing for the holiday.
1085620	1087740	I do not believe there is nothing for the holiday.
1087900	1095700	How? The only way the only way I would believe that is if Nintendo says it's because
1095740	1101180	we're targeting Switch successor for first quarter 2014, then I would believe that there's
1101180	1102060	nothing for the holiday.
1102700	1107900	But I just I know I know what everybody's saying, what the rumors said and what Nintendo
1107900	1109100	has even gone record saying.
1109340	1115500	I just I it blows my mind or there or they're going to really rest on a third party.
1115500	1116580	That could be two.
1116580	1118940	There could be some big third party announcements.
1118940	1124500	I just don't know what they'd be, but maybe something like Xenoblade Chronicles X, because
1124500	1126420	they still didn't have a remade that one.
1126420	1130020	They could, you know, do a remaster of that for the Switch could come out for holiday.
1130500	1133500	You know, there might be a few of those things that they could kind of pull on.
1133500	1138020	I guess Xenoblade would be more second party, but still, you know, there might there might
1138020	1142260	be some things they can kind of pull out to to to band aid the holiday until the Switch
1142260	1143180	successor happens.
1143580	1148380	So. Yeah, Deidre Omez says Mario Kart 9.
1148380	1149900	And yeah, I agree with Bobby.
1149900	1152860	They're not going to release Mario Kart 9 while they're still releasing waves of Mario
1152860	1153980	Kart 8 DLC.
1154220	1158540	I don't see how they release Mario Kart 9 for the Switch at this point, unless it's a
1158540	1161020	hybrid game with whatever the successor is.
1161020	1163540	You know, I hope the successor is fully backwards compatible.
1163860	1166940	We shouldn't count on it, but I think we all hope it is.
1167900	1170980	I think it would be a damn shame if something like Tears of the Kingdom wasn't playable on
1170980	1171900	the next console.
1173180	1174740	But we'll see. I don't know.
1175980	1182060	I would again, and I've said this before on the show, I'll make it quick, the low hanging
1182100	1187780	fruit, quote unquote, game to release, in my opinion, that kind of blows my mind that
1187780	1195300	they haven't done it this year is Mario Odyssey 2, especially with Mario movie having
1195300	1199740	been this year. And now the Blu-ray coming out in a couple of weeks.
1199740	1202860	Right. In fact, I actually know it's like next week because I think somebody in Discord
1202860	1207020	was saying the Best Buy like shifted to people's homes already, like broke street on it
1207020	1212620	or whatever. I'm still kind of blown away that there was no tie in Mario product for the
1212620	1221100	Mario movie. So again, I would think a Mario Odyssey 2 or something in the Mario
1221100	1224100	universe is the holiday title.
1225060	1226700	But what do I know?
1228580	1231300	Although I have had a lot of predictions come true this year, I'm just saying.
1231300	1233580	Nothing. All right.
1234980	1238180	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
1238180	1240500	this week, whether it's one to switch or something else.
1241140	1242580	Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week?
1243500	1245500	We have Black Knight Sword of Rage.
1246980	1251260	We have the pro version and I've been playing some of that and it pisses me off.
1252940	1258300	Been playing through Marvel's Midnight Suns on my second playthrough, doing a light
1258300	1261740	play through and I've got Storm and she's amazing.
1262980	1266940	But I think also her voice actress was Sindel, I think.
1266940	1267940	I'll have to double check.
1269460	1274500	But I'm just finding a lot of like the Netherrealm crossovers is kind of interesting.
1275940	1279260	But at any rate, I've been enjoying that.
1279260	1281620	I'm still doing, of course, Dead by Daylight.
1283580	1285540	Probably going to work on my Adept some more.
1286380	1287980	And did the.
1289380	1290340	What else is I playing?
1290340	1292780	Oh, yeah, Cult of the Lamb, which I love.
1294780	1297620	I played seven hours of Midnight Suns.
1297620	1299340	I didn't go to bed until like 4 a.m.
1300100	1301220	You were streaming late.
1302060	1308860	Yeah, well, Dan was staying up and he was going to let me know when the finale was up for.
1308860	1310780	Oh, yeah.
1310780	1317820	Game stone quick ended late for us and early for that because it was like five or six in the morning for them.
1317820	1322660	He passed out and finally I just could not keep my eyes open anymore.
1322660	1336980	I was just really fading and like I didn't get up until one today because I mean, it's why my submissions were so bare was because I barely could remember my name.
1336980	1339340	It was.
1340540	1346620	It was like the fatigue was like to the point I actually couldn't get out of my chair.
1348140	1355580	So if no one knows what the feeling of having your muscles ache to the point where you literally cannot move.
1356620	1357620	That's where I was.
1358620	1360620	And I actually.
1361980	1373020	Finally, after a little bit, managed to conserve enough that I could get up and go to bed, Michigan's Midnight Suns is a great game, and you can read all about it on the Internet.
1374940	1375540	I'm kidding.
1376540	1389860	It's it's a Marvel sort of strategy RPG-ish kind of game where you have like a card deck that dictates your moves to use in the battle sequences.
1391060	1403500	And you can do like story things and other things to like gain experience and gain items that will help you out and boost you up and all of this stuff.
1403500	1408420	And then you kind of not romance people, you kind of make friends with them.
1408980	1412460	It's just making friends, although some of them totally flirt with you.
1412460	1417380	Like, I seriously think that Morbius just is a flirt, like an unapologetic flirt.
1419620	1420220	It's great.
1422100	1427420	I was trying to get some B-roll of the game up for one of your streams, but for whatever reason, it was taking a sweet time.
1427420	1431500	But for those watching live on Twitch, there's some a Dark Soccer stream from last night.
1431500	1433700	So you see a little bit of what the game looks like.
1433700	1439300	So you can kind of see like it's the part where I burped into the mic, they don't hear the audio anyway.
1440260	1440980	It's just the video.
1440980	1455060	But you can see that you're like you kind of like you have a battlefield fight RPG thing like, I don't know, Chrono Trigger, but you're using cards to actually make the plays, which is interesting.
1455060	1457900	It's not just like fight, magic, run, right?
1457900	1461260	It's you're using cards to make your different plays, which is interesting.
1461260	1462380	It's a different way to do it, right?
1462900	1466620	And you have to be able to use your environment or combo your cards.
1467060	1479500	Like one thing that I like is that you eventually get the ability for your party members to be an obstacle that causes damage to the others instead of them getting hurt when you knock some money into them.
1480500	1486980	But like some of the major characters, you know, were corrupted, like in this clip, it's Scarlet Witch was corrupted.
1489220	1494380	And like Venom, Sabretooth, those are the big ones.
1494380	1499540	You fight Dracula, Mephisto, you know, some big Marvel names.
1499540	1507940	And I like that the continuity of it sort of it's mostly comic continuity, but it's its own universes continuity as well.
1507940	1509740	It's not like MCU style, though.
1509740	1514220	There are some some touches, you know, I think it's a great game.
1514220	1521620	I mean, I have zero regrets for having bought the legendary edition for a hundred bucks when they came out.
1522540	1525020	All right. And Storm, oh, my God.
1525220	1530860	So I love Deadpool and Morbius is OK and Venom is OK.
1531460	1534540	But Storm, oh, she's amazing.
1535380	1539540	All right, that's it for your gaming week, we'll go over to Loki.
1540580	1546300	Yep, more Minecraft just been plugging away, but an episode this week
1547980	1555580	built the giant metal giant met that's from Mega Man three, I think it's a mid boss that has giant
1557340	1559380	was thrusters, I guess, on the bottom of it.
1559380	1562500	So that was kind of fun. A big quarry.
1562500	1567460	Yeah, still working on more stuff for my season, trying to wrap things up.
1569580	1578460	And if folks want to check out your build video, of course, they can go to your YouTube over at Loki underscore O.L.R., right?
1578620	1580300	No underscore, just Loki O.L.R.
1580500	1584580	Oh, because I went to because I was just pulling the video and I did underscore Loki O.L.R.
1584580	1586900	and it worked, but whatever weird.
1588740	1589900	But yeah, you can check out the bill.
1589900	1595100	I was trying to see if I could show a little part in that video, because this is where you're kind of like in the weeds, maybe here.
1595140	1596820	Yeah, there there's the giant metal.
1596820	1598020	Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
1598020	1599140	Wow. Look at that. Sorry.
1599140	1606780	Sorry to those on the podcast feed, but just imagine I'm showing a very elaborate Minecraft build where Loki is kind of like in this pit.
1607020	1611300	There's like a tiny little door that he's going in that I imagine kind of helps him get back up to the top.
1611300	1613620	And you can see where the storage room is.
1613620	1615900	There's a farm farm in the giant metal.
1615900	1617500	It drops stuff out of the bottom of it.
1617500	1619060	Got it. Got it.
1619060	1624140	But but yeah, there's a really cool little Mega Man guy that floats up there at the top.
1624140	1625820	And yeah, this is this is great.
1625820	1628300	You do these such elaborate builds are so cool.
1628860	1630820	So I hope more people check them out.
1632100	1635540	God, just look how vast the Minecraft world is.
1636340	1637860	Sometimes you really.
1638020	1639820	Yeah, the size is just incredible.
1640060	1641820	Anyway. All right.
1643460	1645020	So that's it, just Minecraft for you.
1646460	1647780	Yep, just Minecraft.
1648100	1652980	All right. My gaming week again, I've been kind of sick, so it's cut into my time a little bit.
1652980	1657460	But, you know, I was all over Diablo 4, which, of course, had early access this week.
1657460	1667620	So speaking about paying one hundred dollars for the ultimate edition of the game, I paid the fee to get in and do the early access in Diablo, which I have been playing quite a bit.
1668020	1672420	Not as much as some people I know, because like yesterday I couldn't even sit down and focus.
1672420	1676580	I had so much sinus pressure, like right in that place that sucks to have sinus pressure.
1677460	1679940	So, like, I couldn't focus for long periods of time.
1679940	1683180	But everywhere is horrible.
1683180	1686020	But anyway, I did beat act two.
1686020	1687140	I did that earlier today.
1687140	1695060	So and act one was the basically the equivalent of the demo or the beta that was out before.
1695300	1696580	That was how much story was available.
1696580	1698700	So I've been able to play a little more and go through act two.
1699500	1706540	And I don't know if I have a lot else to say about this game that I didn't already say when I was talking about the beta, because obviously I've gotten to sample it a little bit.
1706980	1713140	But, you know, just to recap, I think this is more rooted in Diablo two than it is Diablo three.
1713740	1715860	I don't think being rooted in Diablo three is a bad thing.
1715860	1721500	I love Diablo three, but I realize a lot of people kind of missed some of the parts of two when they went to three.
1722220	1723940	And I think this is more rooted in two.
1723940	1725580	And I think there's a lot of people that are going to enjoy that.
1725580	1727820	But it has a lot of the quality of life stuff from three.
1728660	1734260	The open world stuff is very interesting because that's the only part that's like a little weird because it isn't randomized.
1734580	1736300	The overworld is always the same.
1736300	1738100	It is gigantic, though.
1738300	1747180	And there are all of these dungeons that you can go in, excuse me, and those are randomized and everything else that you do, like a classic Diablo game is randomized.
1747220	1751180	My understanding is once you get into end game, then you'll go in some of those areas.
1751180	1753900	And that's kind of like end game is running those randomized.
1753900	1760740	But with affixes, it sounds a lot like mythic dungeon runs in World of Warcraft.
1761380	1766180	I hope to be able to speak more on that in a week when I have assumably beaten the story.
1767020	1769460	I'll be streaming it on my own feed throughout the week this week.
1769460	1771420	They're going to be doing some Twitch drops this week, by the way.
1771900	1778220	So I would encourage you, if you have any interest in Diablo at all, watch the streams to get the draw.
1778220	1781060	I guess eat KFC, if you must, to get those drops as well.
1781060	1783300	But if you want to collect that stuff, if you don't, then whatever.
1783300	1786820	It's just I don't think they do anything besides really cosmetics.
1787580	1789780	That is the one thing, by the way, with Diablo 4.
1789780	1804060	I have to agree with a lot of the stuff I've been reading that it is unfortunate that they kind of put all that cosmetic pay stuff in there because it's ridiculous when they've already paying $70 for the game.
1804500	1817980	But at least it is confined to its own little menu, its own little shop, and it isn't something where like you have to click through a pop up or anything like that, or it doesn't try to coax you the way a lot of free to play games will.
1818700	1819740	It doesn't do any of that.
1819740	1822820	So I will say at least it kind of puts it in its own little corner.
1823140	1833820	The one thing I don't like is that if you're like me and you can't stand to see notifications, so like you will know that you have a new quest unlocked.
1833820	1836500	There's a little notification thing in that tab, so you want to go clear it.
1836980	1839620	The shop tab always has new notifications in it.
1840260	1846020	So that little like part of me that like wants to clear all my notifications can't do it without going to the shop.
1846020	1847500	That's how they get you.
1848820	1851460	But otherwise, it's whatever.
1851780	1854220	I'll be interested to see what they do with the battle pass.
1854220	1859180	That's going to be very interesting when that, but I guess that's tied to seasonal content.
1860420	1866340	And, you know, Dead by Daylight has battle passes and it's all cosmetics and I don't mind it.
1866340	1870540	So I'll kind of be curious to see if it's a similar system in Diablo, which I believe it's supposed to be.
1870860	1876060	It's just, you know, how many of these season achievements you do basically tie into how much of the battle pass stuff you unlock.
1876380	1877700	And it is all cosmetics.
1877700	1881820	But yeah, I'm playing a druid and my druid is through act two.
1881820	1883820	My druid is level forty one.
1883820	1888060	No. Thirty nine, I think just before forty.
1890220	1891220	I think I went the wrong way.
1891220	1892580	It's a tractor level, not at a level.
1893100	1899300	My druid is level thirty nine and just got through act two because I'm one of those people that's like, I have to do every side quest.
1899300	1900900	I have to find every Lilith statue.
1900900	1901780	I have to do all these things.
1902020	1913540	But I finally got myself to stop doing that because the bonuses that you get in each zone stop at a certain point and you have to be in world tier three, which is a higher level to unlock the highest stuff.
1913900	1921020	So basically I said, OK, I will allow myself to go side quest adventure to get my two skill points that you get and then I'm stopping.
1921580	1925020	So that's that's what I just finished in the second zone.
1925020	1928500	I beat act two and then I got my second skill point from the zone.
1928500	1935980	So later tonight I will probably go and play act three and see how far I can get with that tonight.
1936660	1939420	Mishkins in chat says there's going to be a battle pass for D4.
1939420	1940540	Oh, Lord. Yep.
1941860	1945420	But again, it's supposedly all cosmetic.
1945820	1946900	That's what they promised.
1946900	1954020	So if that's what it stays as, then I don't think it's going to be too big an issue because the character creator is pretty good.
1954940	1958780	You'll probably you've probably seen a lot of people on social media sharing the characters that they've made.
1959100	1962540	You can make a lot of diverse, different types of characters.
1963220	1968940	In Diablo three, every character kind of had their default and you couldn't really customize that.
1969260	1974020	Now they don't have a default druid or a default barbarian.
1974300	1979820	It is always when you're on the character select screen, it is always randomized, the characters that are sitting there.
1980060	1986700	So you can see different looking people anytime you look at the menu of a class select, which I think is interesting.
1986700	1988260	I like that they kind of mix it up like that.
1988700	1994700	So Mish in chat says I made a second character because I'm like you, Rob, I do everything I can.
1995020	1998860	I'll make a second character, too, eventually, but I'll wait for the season content to do it.
1999100	2002460	When the season content drops, then I'll make a second character.
2002460	2009300	And, you know, because I assume that season characters will roll into regular like before.
2009860	2013180	Other than that, I've also been playing more Final Fantasy 14.
2013220	2024980	I should get my island sanctuary to rank 14 tonight because that's my end game content is island sanctuary or the, I guess, animal crossing for lack of it's more like farm simulator or something is more like what it is.
2025780	2028300	What are the what is the name of that big farming game?
2028500	2029620	Why is the name escape me?
2030020	2031860	Harvest Moon. It's more Harvest Moon than that.
2033220	2035460	But I'll get to that tonight.
2035460	2038340	And I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, just a little.
2038700	2041700	But I did get Jane to prestige one.
2042180	2045900	I only have a handful of characters left to art at prestige one and Jane was one of them.
2045900	2047460	So I got my adept Jane as well.
2047500	2061740	So, yeah, I should also mention what Dead by Daylight they did a big pride stream earlier this week and they released a lot of charm content that are related to Pride Month.
2061980	2070500	So meaning like, you know, charms are things that your survivor can wear on their little belt or, you know, belt area or killers.
2071180	2073260	Yeah, killers can have them on their hook.
2073620	2079420	So most Lijabodqua people had the rainbow charms.
2079420	2087500	But now, like Dark Saga just said, you can have an ace charm if you want to have an ace charm or a pan flag if you want to have that or trans flags.
2087500	2092700	They released a lot of different identities within the spectrum this week.
2092700	2100100	And that's really cool for those that, you know, want to use those and further identify or what have you.
2100100	2106780	And I think they also released another rainbow charm that was like an eye that looked pretty cool, too, like a more generalized pride charm that was neat.
2106980	2113300	So there is the one thing to bring up we had touched on before.
2113300	2113980	Yeah, please.
2114660	2129780	Yeah, so Pupers was, you know, a big figure in the community, one of the early fog whisperers, you know, the representatives of the game and just a really all around great person.
2129780	2137380	And he finally died on the second from ALS complications of ALS.
2138380	2149780	And so, on that note, you know, we just want to offer our empathy to family and friends, the people who knew him the best.
2149780	2159380	And also, you know, a show of support for the community, for everyone who he touched.
2159380	2160780	He is definitely a light in the fog.
2161380	2164980	Yeah, a lot of people in the Twitch community feeling lost this week, for sure.
2164980	2167060	And may his memory be a blessing.
2168060	2168860	All right.
2170260	2174260	I think that's everything to say on my gaming week.
2174260	2176900	So let's get into some news.
2177380	2178420	I'm going to turn it again.
2178420	2183100	The show is probably going to be a little shorter tonight, just because I'm feeling kind of bled or sacros feeling kind of bled.
2183300	2186580	But we do have some news we want to get through and talk about some of the headlines this week.
2186580	2188700	So, Loki, I'm going to let you start it off.
2193380	2194020	Right, Loki?
2194860	2195660	I'm sorry, what was that?
2195940	2197020	You started off, right?
2197140	2197620	Yeah.
2197620	2203860	Yep, meta quest three, I think I've been actually waiting for because I wanted to pick up a new VR headset.
2203860	2208620	And I know that they were going to be announcing a new meta quest three.
2208620	2210420	And now here we go.
2210980	2224860	So the quest three is going to be coming out this fall, starting at $500, along with that they're gonna be dropping the price of the quest to down $100 again, so they raised it and now it's back down again.
2224860	2226780	So that's interesting.
2227620	2240100	Looks like it has more front facing cameras, a more powerful Snapdragon processor in as well, it's going to be capable of doing some AR stuff as well, which is kind of cool.
2240580	2258620	And then on top of that, they're going to be also doing a patch, or I guess not really a patch, a firmware update for the quest to, to actually bump up the power of it by like, I think 20-25% or up to 25% more.
2258620	2261780	So that's kind of nice for folks who have the the older one.
2261780	2272100	Let's see, yeah, so $500 for the 128 gigabyte storage version, and then 256, no price on that yet.
2272100	2288220	But it is interesting to see, you know that it is, I mean, I'm curious to check out to see how much better it is, because I know my VR headset is pretty old, and I would like a new one that can sit in the box that I probably won't ever use.
2288220	2292140	But it's nice to know that I'll have one in case I do want to use it.
2293860	2295460	My kids are always saying, are you going to get us one?
2295460	2300180	I'm like, you already have a quest to that I bought you like six months ago, so shut up.
2302140	2312180	But yeah, the they've got, yeah, 40% smaller than the quest to it's got the same pancake lens optics from the quest pro.
2312180	2317300	So that's cool, even better visuals and a higher resolution display.
2317340	2324420	And they said much higher resolution quality pass through cameras now in color, assisted with a special depth sensor.
2324420	2329260	So that's going to be hopefully for AR, possibly.
2331020	2334580	Maybe we'll have to see some of the games and what they do.
2335140	2345980	Yes, we will have to see some of those games, including the one that they did promise us last time we talked about VR, and still nothing.
2346580	2364700	So back on October 28th, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, the lizard man himself, promised that they're going to be working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for VR, to which I said, wow, I don't really care about that because that's going to look like garbage in VR because it's so damn old.
2364700	2370220	But OK, sure, you know, if that's all I get, then I'm fine with that, I guess.
2370740	2376780	Um, nothing about the game at all.
2378500	2380700	So is it coming out?
2381180	2386460	Hopefully, Grow Street Games isn't working on it because that will be all sorts of awful.
2389860	2394020	I don't know, I like once again, like until I saw that article, I completely forgot about it.
2394020	2397420	Yeah, I forgot that that was the thing, too, until that story was making the rounds this week.
2398420	2404980	It's not really like a really cool thing to have an exclusive like, yeah, it's exclusive Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2404980	2408220	I mean, you might as well just do like Grand Theft Auto one at that point.
2408220	2416220	I mean, it's so old, like, is that really all the quest three can handle is just like San Andreas?
2416420	2423900	Unless they're doing something real extra to it, which I don't I don't know why they'd have the license to do that, but I would hope not.
2424300	2429100	Like do like I'd be excited about Grand Theft Auto for VR, like I'd be down for that.
2429100	2435660	Like that's about as old as I would go with Grand Theft Auto for VR on like one of those headsets.
2435820	2439780	San Andreas is just too damn old at this point, but that's it's like a remake.
2439780	2445020	That's also you and you were like a top leaderboard player on Grand Theft Auto four.
2445020	2452980	So yes, I am hoping someday that Grand Theft Auto four comes back with online support so that I can once again dominate leaderboards again.
2453980	2455020	That will be my game.
2455020	2458460	But. But wait, we'll have to wait.
2459820	2468500	Random aside, real quick, speaking of VR games is not related to what you just talked about, Loki, and technically this isn't about VR, but a game that does play in VR.
2468820	2482780	Dark Soccer, I thought of you this week because I think I felt like our worlds collided a little bit because No Man's Sky, one of my favorite games that I talk about all the time, teased a lot of you know, they were when
2483780	2492700	Hello Games wants to tease a new or Sean Murray specifically, when he wants to tease a new game, he uses emojis and he was using a lot of Apple emojis this week.
2492700	2495860	And everybody was like, oh, is No Man's Sky coming out on Mac?
2496060	2497820	And sure enough, that was it.
2497820	2499940	No Man's Sky came out on Mac this week.
2499940	2506660	So this this game that's like seven years old, that continues to come out on these platforms.
2506660	2513260	But I did I was I and I thought it was legit cool that like it's coming out through Steam, basically.
2513260	2521260	And if you already bought No Man's Sky on Steam, on PC or wherever else, you just get the Mac one free, quote unquote.
2521260	2523180	So it's already unlocked for you.
2523180	2524180	So I thought that was really cool.
2524260	2526100	So that's pretty good.
2526100	2529940	I mean, I already have it for Steam, so that'll be nice.
2529940	2532380	Oh, then, yeah, it's already in your library.
2532540	2533740	So that's really cool.
2534100	2536820	I just didn't want to have to keep logging into GeForce for it.
2538100	2539020	Yeah, this is fine.
2539140	2540060	Yeah, interesting.
2540860	2549580	You know, and if rumors about where Apple may be, because the No Man's Sky developer said we have something else to announce really soon.
2550260	2557060	If rumors about where Apple could be going very, very soon, true not to be true, that could be very interesting.
2557060	2561300	But we'll we'll wait until those curtains are pulled back.
2561300	2565740	I have not heard of any rumors, nor have I the desire to comment on them.
2565980	2567180	Yep. All right.
2567660	2568700	Yep. All right.
2568980	2572100	Well, let's move on and talk about something else.
2572100	2576260	Another game that I really like now, Diablo 4, because obviously I've been playing quite a bit of it.
2576740	2580820	But some people, unfortunately, have had a lot more trouble playing Diablo 4.
2581340	2589900	For the most part, the launch of Diablo 4 has actually been like shockingly smooth for a Diablo game or for a Blizzard game.
2589900	2596340	Excuse me. Like, you know, well, I got to say, actually, some of their more recent WoW expansions have actually launched pretty smoothly as well.
2596740	2604340	I think Blizzard just has that reputation from 10 years ago of having a lot of hot mess launches and certainly Diablo 3.
2604780	2614260	Y'all remember the big era when people were trying to play Diablo 3 and everybody was pissed that Diablo 3 was always online, which is funny because that's like the norm now and nobody cares anymore.
2614660	2617180	But Diablo 3 had all those issues.
2617580	2625100	Well, for the most part, for most people, Diablo 4 hasn't been an issue, but it has been on the PlayStation 5.
2625740	2631660	Some folks are having problems getting into Diablo 4 on the PlayStation 5, and this is because of what's called a valid license error.
2632020	2638180	So apparently what would happen is that if the game just couldn't authenticate or whatever, it would not let you in the game.
2638580	2642260	People found a workaround of doing one of two things.
2642260	2651180	The first workaround that was found was, oh, if you buy two dollars worth of the Diablo currency on the PlayStation store, you can get in.
2651660	2653460	And people were like, oh, that's shitty.
2653460	2661380	Oh, that's shady. But what the trick really is, is that you're downloading something new from the store and it's causing the store to refresh your account.
2661660	2668100	So people realized if you download a free game, you can also like go download Fortnite or whatever is free to play.
2668100	2669460	There's a ton of stuff in the free play section.
2669860	2673500	Go download something there and it will update your license and then you can get into Diablo 4.
2673860	2680380	Interestingly enough, this doesn't seem specific to PlayStation because it's also been happening on Xbox.
2680660	2685780	I know Dark Tetsuya was saying, yeah, I've been having a similar problem on the Xbox series.
2686380	2692500	So it doesn't seem like it's as prevalent on Microsoft, but it definitely hit PlayStation.
2693780	2695460	Really interesting thought.
2696460	2709700	You know, all this stuff lately about Microsoft trying to buy Activision and Blizzard and Sony's response was that, well, they could screw us on launches if they wanted to.
2711500	2722180	Now, I don't think Blizzard or Activision screwed the launch here because I think if it's a store license issue, that sounds like a Sony problem to me.
2723060	2727940	But if it's on multiple platforms, though, that is, yeah, that is so I'm not I'm not sure.
2729860	2747180	I feel like this is going to get diagnosed a little further, because if this is a Sony problem, then whatever Sony has to eat it, if this is a Blizzard problem, this issue is going to come back again in an arbitration room or a courtroom watch.
2748060	2752340	Because this is exactly what Sony was bitching about coming to life.
2754420	2755540	For better or for worse.
2759100	2766780	Yeah, I mean, I could see them someone doing a case, I really that it's not letting you play it for like a day or so, whatever.
2766860	2769260	I mean, they obviously got it fixed.
2769260	2772660	It's not like it's not saying, oh, we got to purchase it.
2773660	2778700	You know, you know, the pay to be in their minute one if they're not in their minute one.
2778700	2784940	And by the way, they that by the way, the part a lot of people aren't saying they actually opened the servers 10 minutes early.
2784940	2787140	It was supposed to launch at four o'clock Pacific.
2787420	2796420	Those sneaky little sneaks actually plugged it in at 350 just for this reason to not everybody slam at the same second.
2796980	2798820	They opened it early so people could get in.
2799460	2803340	It's a smart thing to do, but so they can have a little bit more graceful.
2803340	2805660	But again, on the PC front, you wouldn't know anything is wrong.
2805660	2807380	It's running smooth as butter on PC.
2807860	2809860	Like, yeah, I mean, sure.
2809860	2811380	Like people are going to sue about everything.
2811380	2817180	I still see like advertisements on Facebook about like steam lawsuits saying that steam is monopolizing PC and like.
2818740	2820780	Do you not understand how storefronts work?
2822140	2822700	But like.
2824060	2825460	Yeah, I don't know.
2825460	2825980	Yeah, sure.
2825980	2827140	I guess anything's possible.
2827140	2829140	People are dumb and will like sue over everything.
2829140	2831620	But like, I think is it is it warranted?
2831620	2833740	Probably not in this scenario.
2833740	2835140	I don't think they sue.
2835140	2836580	But keep in mind, the U.S.
2836580	2839220	hasn't made their decision yet on this whole thing.
2839340	2841260	So that's why I say it's coming up.
2841260	2845500	Not even like, yeah, that's not even anything like, well, see, you couldn't play it.
2845820	2849180	But yeah, it's like, but yeah, that's that's on Sony storefront.
2849180	2855580	Like it was your like if you had these license error issues, like, I don't know, it just sounds like a setup problem.
2855580	2858860	And it was on both platforms like.
2858860	2862900	That's just really like drawing straw there, like it's just like it's.
2863940	2868540	I mean, sure, if that's what like puts them over the edge saying, see, see.
2869420	2871380	No, I don't think it'll put it over the edge.
2871380	2872540	I don't think everybody like.
2872540	2875020	No, I don't think it puts anything of the edge, but I think it gets brought up.
2875020	2875500	That's all I'm saying.
2875500	2876460	I think this gets brought up.
2876460	2878980	I think Sony pulls this out and says, look what happened.
2880700	2882820	So it'll be interesting.
2882820	2883260	I don't know.
2884260	2892260	By the way, and on all that, I heard that, you know, you know, obviously people talk a lot and there's a lot of stuff circulating social media.
2892660	2901380	Apparently, somebody with Activision Blizzard is supposed to be meeting with somebody with the UK government to try to get them to reverse their decision on the appeal on blocking the merge.
2901620	2905180	But there is talk on the table that Activision Blizzard may pull out of the UK.
2906740	2911100	If the Microsoft thing goes through, they may just straight pull out of the UK.
2912100	2922220	That's an interesting thing for them to leverage, because it's not that the games would suffer because all they have to do is release the games as Microsoft in the UK.
2923420	2925620	They would close all the offices in the UK.
2926340	2933460	So I believe now that they could be playing this game is that they're basically saying, if you block us, we'll just pull all your employees out of the UK.
2933660	2935580	I think they're going to try to strong arm it that way.
2936420	2938380	That's a pretty.
2938380	2940580	It's shitty, but it's it's also business.
2941500	2942100	I get it.
2942540	2944260	Oh, God. What was that company?
2944260	2944860	It was.
2947940	2948900	Not Konami.
2948900	2954220	Remember, Konami had the the other like publishing arm that they use for the Nintendo because.
2954340	2955140	No, it's Ultra.
2955380	2955860	It's Ultra.
2955860	2956260	Ultra.
2956340	2956660	Yeah.
2956660	2957940	Ultra Games is coming back.
2957940	2960780	Babies publishing Diablo and Call of Duty.
2962020	2966540	I think I think if the US also blocks it, then they can't do that.
2966580	2972860	But if the UK kind of sticks out like a thumb where they're the only one that blocked it out of the others, absolutely.
2972860	2981100	Microsoft, they're going to put that on the table that basically like, OK, well, we're going to just dissolve Activision Blizzard's presence in the UK then.
2981460	2984420	And they'll I mean, it is shitty, but.
2985460	2986620	But it's a good tactic.
2986620	2988740	I mean, yeah, it's a good tactic.
2988740	2990060	Very good strong arm.
2990060	2996140	Yeah, but again, the UK has to stand alone in blocking it, which is a whole other issue.
2996140	2999980	If they're standing alone blocking it, then we kind of look at it going, well, why are they blocking it and everybody else?
3000380	3004020	Yeah, I mean, it's not the first time the UK's done something to block.
3006140	3006580	All right.
3008100	3009220	Anyhow, moving on.
3009220	3014580	No offense, the people are not their government, but I'm saying the government's been doing some shit.
3015700	3025420	Believe me, after after the years 2016 to 2021 here in the US, please, please understand the people are not the government.
3025900	3026660	Oh, indeed.
3026660	3030260	Indeed, we understand that more than anyone.
3030260	3032220	We we love all our friends in the UK.
3032220	3036740	Loudest and worst, you know, the sore thumb sticks out.
3038860	3039340	All right.
3039660	3042860	Anyhow, Dark Soccer, Konami got brought up.
3042860	3044220	So, hey, let's talk about this.
3045180	3047660	Silent Hill Ascension.
3048260	3052220	So basically it is going to launch this year.
3052220	3053620	There is a trailer.
3054100	3070500	It is coming out with Behavior, Bad Robot Games, DJ2 Entertainment and Genvid all together released the trailer for Silent Hill Ascension.
3070500	3078820	You know what I kind of hope with Behavior involved in it is that we get some updates for the Silent or we get another Silent Hill pack.
3079900	3081540	For Dead by Daylight, but going back to...
3081540	3082300	I would love that.
3083020	3083380	Yeah.
3083860	3099660	But anyway, with Silent Hill Ascension, you are going around Silent Hill and there are actions that are going to be going into the game.
3099660	3105460	Kind of, I guess it almost sounds almost like the quarry, you know, where your actions are going to build the outcome of the game.
3106700	3111340	But you are going to be playing with a global audience.
3111340	3112900	I guess it's built for streaming.
3114220	3120100	But they are basically going to...
3120100	3122180	Hello, I am trying to see where exactly it is under.
3122180	3123380	They are talking about the environment a lot.
3123940	3132060	But they are going to build a completely immersive experience with, you know, live community driven moments.
3132060	3139460	I am reckoning that something like how Cult of the Lamb works, you know, or having a built in Dixper or something.
3139980	3140940	Interesting.
3141820	3147660	But I want to read this quote from Okamoto Motoy, who is the series producer at Konami.
3148540	3151820	Silent Hill fans and horror audiences everywhere will have a lot to look forward to.
3151820	3162300	We are pleased to tell a new interactive story and never before explored locations alongside new characters that will be introduced to fans of the Silent Hill universe.
3163020	3170060	It is you who decide the fate of multiple main characters, which will unfold simultaneously around the globe.
3171340	3181700	Hmm, it almost sounds like the creative direction of the show could be whatever the Internet votes on, like it might not be like an individualized experience.
3181700	3192780	I don't know. I can't kind of tell, but I'm getting the sense that like it's actually whatever the entire Internet decides is what happens, which actually sounds really horrific and I hope is not the direction they go in.
3192780	3197380	That sounds very like how Elon Musk wants to run Twitter.
3198100	3200460	And I don't know how I feel about that.
3200620	3202620	But I'm hoping I'm misunderstanding that.
3203660	3208020	I think it's going to be like a choose your own adventure, you're going to have the presets.
3208020	3209340	OK, well, that would be much better.
3210300	3218700	But the thing is, is that this allows for a replay of seasons, if that makes sense.
3220500	3222500	I mean, it looks pretty interesting.
3222500	3227220	I would rather play, you know.
3227540	3240420	Yeah, well, I'm OK with a narrative game, like especially like a tell tale kind of game or, you know, you even brought up Until Dawn or Cory, but I think that, oh, no, that's being done in the Dead by Daylight universe.
3240420	3249780	So I guess I get all these horror game franchises mixed up sometimes, but it could be interesting to see something go that direction for sure as well.
3249780	3259140	But yeah, I just I worry if it's something where the entire Internet votes on it because it's it's going to get gross real quick.
3259700	3261940	What? The Internet is a cesspool?
3262180	3263300	Yes, that part.
3264220	3267060	So, yeah, I just I hope they're not going that direction.
3267380	3270060	But we'll see when the game comes out or we have some more details.
3270740	3275540	S2100 Matt in chat says, yeah, I worry how that will play out.
3275540	3278180	Yeah, I'm going to try to be helpful.
3278260	3286860	Yeah, I want to try to be helpful, too, and I'll wait I'll wait to see some gameplay, some details to really kind of formulate those thoughts, but it does feel a little nebulous right now.
3287660	3288860	Oh, of course.
3288860	3304580	But I'm still I'm I'm maintaining a little bit of hope that maybe it's enough that people will be fans of the series and want to that the good will outweigh the bad.
3304620	3308780	Yeah, and on the bright side, it's not the only Silent Hill thing that's coming out either.
3308780	3315300	So if this doesn't end up being your cup of tea, you still have the Silent Hill 2 remake, you still have the Silent Hill F or whatever that was called, they showed the trailer for.
3315540	3319260	So it's still all these other places they're building out the universe.
3319260	3322420	So if this doesn't end up being your cup of tea, there's probably something that will be.
3323980	3327020	Except Pachinko, for some reason, they're done with the Pachinko.
3327020	3328100	I don't know what that's all about.
3328420	3331420	Maybe no one's into the Apache slot that much anymore.
3331660	3332300	I guess.
3333180	3333660	All right.
3333660	3336580	Well, speaking of something else, people don't seem to be into anymore.
3336860	3340100	Loki, let's talk about a recently released game.
3340500	3349700	Yeah, I don't know if anybody was into it much when it came out, but there were a couple of people in chat here that were like, it's not as bad as everyone says is it sounds like could have been better.
3349700	3355500	It sounds like it's one of those things where it's like once you get back, is that like Harambee in the background on your stream?
3355500	3356620	What the hell was that?
3357340	3358980	This is one to switch.
3359380	3364580	This is what you deserve is a stupid monkey doing garbage.
3365780	3367420	I don't even know half these games.
3367420	3368780	I've played one to switch.
3368780	3370740	I didn't even know about half of these games.
3370740	3371220	It's in.
3371220	3375540	I remind you they have a game that I even when I saw it, I was like, what?
3375540	3384340	Like where they had you rock your controller to you had to rock the controller because the controller was a baby and you had to put it to sleep.
3385260	3388500	And my mind's like, someone's going to shake that damn controller.
3389540	3394540	So that would be wasn't there like a cookie mama spinoff game that was that.
3394540	3399060	And if you shook the controller, it was a big like, no, like that came up like X or something.
3399060	3400220	I swear that was the thing.
3400580	3402340	And that was one where they had it.
3402380	3405980	It was like a baby doll that you actually insert the controller into.
3405980	3411020	Like you put the Wii in its mouth or the Wiimote thing in the mouth or something terrible.
3411020	3413220	You do something horrible to that doll.
3413220	3415820	And yes.
3416540	3418340	Because that poor child did die.
3420940	3421340	All right.
3422140	3425460	Anyways, yeah, game's stupid or just, you know.
3427020	3430620	But anyway, it didn't have the bugs that Redful had.
3430780	3433660	So, you know, that is an unfortunate thing.
3433660	3434580	So what happened?
3434580	3435780	What happened with Redful?
3435780	3437420	Why was it the way it was?
3437420	3445420	Well, some reasons may have come out from this article by Bloomberg basically saying that, look, Microsoft didn't really have
3445420	3449660	hands on on the game development with this game.
3450020	3456500	They kind of left it to Bethesda to take care of, aside from making the decision not to publish it on the PlayStation 5.
3457180	3466260	With that, though, the Austin studio that was handling Redfall, apparently, you know, a good portion of the team, 70% of the
3466260	3474060	team that had made Prey, which was markedly a better game, had left Arkane Austin by the time Redfall had shipped.
3474340	3479220	So losing a lot of that talent could have definitely been part of the problem there as well.
3480940	3487700	Also, there was an interview with Kind of Funny Games where Spencer defended the creative direction of the game, saying one
3487700	3491580	thing I will fight is this sort of what went wrong.
3491580	3495060	There's clearly quality and execution things we can do.
3495300	3499700	But one thing I won't do is push against the creative aspirations of our team.
3500700	3505300	OK, I don't think it was like harping on the creativity of the game.
3505300	3507300	They were just saying the game runs like dog shit.
3507300	3509020	So, you know, maybe don't do that.
3510540	3514660	Yes, I understand the problem with the game is not like the story or creative stuff.
3514660	3518700	It's it's well, that's not I mean, yes and no.
3518700	3528580	Like, I will hark on the I will make a complaint about the creativity of the game, because, like, for example, you have
3528980	3534580	Dishonored, which has like really awesome, like real time cut scenes and stuff like that.
3534580	3539780	That's like a really, you know, a solid narrative to the game.
3539780	3542900	Same with even Deathloop and stuff like that.
3543780	3549620	This one has like static images that they pan slowly across the screen.
3551180	3557060	And that's it, like there's like no like cut scenes in there, it's like they like half-assed it.
3557580	3566580	Which I'm sorry, but like that, when you have one game that looks really cool, like you've put out games that are really high quality and then this one comes out.
3566580	3570820	It's just even that much more of a contrast to your previous games.
3570820	3579860	And so obviously it's people are going to complain about it because it's they were expecting Dishonored and you gave them one to switch.
3579860	3591900	All right, well, let's move on and address another rumor that's going around in the gaming community right now.
3591900	3599540	And that is that CD Projekt Red is apparently trying to get or is Sony is trying to buy CD Projekt Red.
3599940	3613100	And the rumor is so loud that President and CEO Adam Kinski actually said in a recent investor Q&A, not happening, CD Projekt is not for sale.
3613100	3626060	This dates back to apparently a Destiny leaker who had one that had been right before, had a thread on Reddit that PlayStation wants to buy CD Projekt Red in that investor Q&A.
3626060	3628620	The CEO said nothing has changed on our end.
3628700	3632220	I can repeat what we've been saying throughout the year, CD Projekt is not for sale.
3632500	3633780	We want to remain independent.
3633780	3636380	We have, I believe, an excellent strategy for sure.
3636380	3639300	It's not easy to execute, but it's very exciting to follow our path.
3639300	3640820	So it's pure rumor.
3641380	3647060	So we already know that they're working on some other things that have nothing to do with Cyberpunk 2077.
3647060	3650420	For example, a new Witcher trilogy is something that's being worked on.
3651220	3655860	There's also the expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, which will be shown at Cyber Game Fest.
3655860	3657140	That is something they're going to show.
3658060	3660180	So there's still more to come there.
3662100	3672420	But interesting that we always get these rumors about Sony trying to buy somebody like, like they've got to be looking around wondering who can we buy since Microsoft's getting Activision Blizzard?
3672420	3673180	Who can we buy?
3673700	3674220	I don't know.
3674940	3676300	Maybe they'll buy Capcom.
3676300	3676900	I don't know.
3677460	3681420	Just because, yeah, just because, you know, it still could be a true rumor.
3681420	3690060	It could be that, you know, internally, they're like, yeah, we're interested in acquiring this company, but if the company doesn't want to sell, they can't purchase it.
3690060	3690460	Right.
3690460	3693700	You know, that's still so both could be true at the same time.
3694420	3694700	True.
3695420	3696660	Hi, Dr. Sakurai.
3698700	3702020	Well, it's finally happened.
3702020	3706060	I can't make words.
3707580	3713380	It's Chiyo Kazuhiro, who is the current producer of the Mega Man series, has left Capcom.
3714460	3719820	He followed Inahune in 2010 as taking over.
3720340	3729620	The first one he worked on was Mega Man 7 for Super Nintendo and recently worked on Mega Man Legacy Collection and the Battle Network series.
3730140	3732900	But there is no announced replacement for him yet.
3735380	3738580	I wonder if this means they aren't working on a new Mega Man game right now.
3738580	3739460	You think they would be.
3739460	3743060	I thought the more recent entries actually sold pretty decently, but.
3743940	3745260	Yeah, I liked 11.
3745620	3746020	Yeah.
3746500	3749260	So that's unfortunate.
3749260	3754900	And they also they've been re-releasing like a bunch of those collections that probably sold pretty well.
3754900	3757460	So, yeah, Battle Network, all that just came out recently.
3758020	3768980	And and I would like to say that, like, I mean, I get it that they're not making stuff, but like watching the the showcase and like runs of Mega Man Maker games.
3769580	3770380	Pretty awesome.
3770580	3772140	During the summer games done quick.
3773540	3774820	Oh, I didn't see the Mega Man.
3774820	3777300	I saw some of the Mario Maker relay that they were doing.
3777300	3783340	But yeah, so like there's like a PC game that's Mega Man Maker that somebody's that they've developed and stuff.
3783340	3785420	And so you can make your own custom Mega Man games.
3785420	3791540	And they did a bunch of Mega Man levels themed after other, you know, eight big games, which I thought was funny.
3792180	3792980	Yeah, that's cool.
3794020	3795380	Yeah, all right.
3795900	3796660	Moving on, Loki.
3797820	3803460	All right, so there's this whole thing going on with esports now.
3804140	3820700	Basically, some of the leagues are trying to unionize and are striking over plans to make rule changes that would, I guess, cut the North American Challenger League from 16 teams to seven.
3821340	3823060	I thought at least I thought that they were trying to.
3823060	3828700	Yeah, the else the LCS Players Association representing the region's professional players.
3829060	3833660	So the estimated 70 players, coaches, et cetera, lose their jobs.
3834220	3842020	And Riot says that the cuts were necessary to ensure that the North American leagues remain sustainable and economically viable.
3843060	3845660	So they're just going to try to refuse to play.
3845660	3852860	And then Riot's basically going to say, well, if you strike, then we're going to cancel the entire esports season.
3854660	3856740	I guess that makes sense if you don't play teams.
3856740	3857020	Yeah.
3858020	3870300	So they're saying, hopefully, this two week window will give us time to for productive dialogue between the LSCPA teams and the league and then resume LCS competition this summer.
3870580	3880340	The LCS will not be penalizing teams for not fielding their rosters during this two week period to allow for everyone's space to focus on constructive dialogue.
3881340	3890660	We're doing our best to ensure LCS employees, contractors, and others supporting LCS or others supporting the LCS are not negatively impacted by the delay.
3891540	3892100	So.
3893940	3894500	Yep.
3894980	3903620	And there was another thing, too, saying that there's Riot, they said that there's a possibility of teams using scab players.
3904420	3906340	Yeah, so hopefully, hopefully they don't do that.
3907660	3908220	Hmm.
3911020	3913060	I'm just like people.
3913420	3918140	Yeah, a lot of a lot of strong arm tactics going on in the industry right now in there.
3919220	3919540	Yeah.
3920500	3920980	All right.
3921300	3925420	Well, what a terrible what a terrible follow up this makes for it.
3925420	3930820	But it's one of those things where it's like the lion, the witch and the audacity of this bitch.
3930820	3940100	Like, again, here we are talking about, you know who, the CEO of Activision Blizzard, Bobby Beeptic.
3940540	3941540	Bobby Crap?
3942700	3946580	I don't know why, but he got a fucking cover story on variety this week.
3946820	3951620	And I'm assuming it's because of Diablo four's launch or whatever, which variety is a Hollywood thing.
3951620	3954220	But we know games are starting to bleed the line with Hollywood.
3954220	3955020	So fine, whatever.
3955220	3956580	I get why variety is doing that.
3956580	3958780	But to give this guy the cover, Christ.
3959620	3971700	But there's this whole interview that they just basically give him a platform to say things like, quote, we've had every possible form of investigation done and we did not have a systemic issue with harassment ever.
3972180	3976180	Well, fucking Jason laid it out in the intro already.
3976540	3980500	Like the lie detector test determined that was a lie.
3981420	3983140	Like, lie detectors don't work.
3984780	3986060	It's a Maury reference.
3987060	3994340	But it's just, yeah, obviously, you know, Diablo four is launching and all that stuff.
3994340	4009780	And oh, he's variety says in that interview, quote, continue to comment from, you know, who is saying, look, like any large company with 16000 employees, we're going to have some instances of workplace discrimination or harassment.
4010380	4015820	We're fortunate over our 30 years has been a very small number and it's something that we care deeply about.
4015820	4018940	I swear to God, that sounds like something our last president would have said.
4019180	4029580	That sounds like a quote from what the last like the the way that's phrased is just from the school of I'm not even going to say his name, but you all know who I'm talking about.
4030500	4032100	It's a very small number.
4032300	4032820	We care.
4033580	4036340	That is no, we don't care at all.
4039980	4041020	He needs to go.
4041060	4042180	He needs to go.
4042180	4046020	I mean, yeah, this is a perfect example of why he needs to go, because he doesn't think there's a problem.
4046020	4047700	I mean, he's come on.
4047700	4049860	I mean, there's no problem.
4049860	4054700	I mean, obviously, they're not going to come out and say, yeah, we knew about this systemic problem at our company.
4054700	4055940	Of course, he's going to deny it.
4055940	4056860	Of course he is.
4056860	4057620	Here's the thing.
4057820	4060660	He's only emboldened by everything that's happened.
4060860	4064260	Recap the board of directors at Activision.
4064260	4073020	So the own company that talks to this guy every day did that report that cleared Bobby Kotick of any wrongdoing.
4074260	4089860	And in that report, it said, contrary to many of the allegations, the board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that Activision Blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported, which we all know again lie.
4090780	4093300	And Bobby Kotick said now he's just emboldened.
4093300	4102980	He says in the cover story of Variety, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you if any of what you read in the inflammatory narrative was truthful.
4104740	4106580	He shouldn't be sitting there.
4106780	4115860	That's why all of us that care about this industry are so fucking mad, because it's this systemic fuckery going on with the board of directors.
4115980	4117500	I got to watch getting loud tonight.
4117500	4118420	My voice can't handle it.
4118740	4119540	Breathe in, breathe out.
4119540	4127380	OK, it's this systemic fuckery happening with the board of directors that is allowing Bobby Kotick to stay in place.
4127380	4130860	And the whole process is infuriating.
4133140	4140540	And the fact that now this is just a cover story that more people can read as almost like this guy is trying to save face is also.
4141700	4148700	Infuriating, and I just want to see this guy out of our industry sooner rather than later.
4150020	4150660	Period.
4154180	4154820	I agree.
4156140	4157700	And I don't know what else needs to be said.
4158900	4165380	So let's travel back to a simpler time when this guy wasn't in the headlines.
4165380	4172020	Let's go back in this next segment to a more fun time in gaming, if I can find the button.
4174700	4175900	I'm a little flustered by it.
4179540	4189740	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
4190100	4192860	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4193980	4197340	All right, what did you pick for the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?
4198140	4204140	Saturn Bomberman, which is a very specific reason I chose Saturn Bomberman.
4204700	4209300	I love Bomberman, don't get me wrong, but this one is a little bit special.
4209940	4216260	So of course, it was an action game developed by Hudson Soft for Sega Saturn.
4216580	4228580	It is the 12th Bomberman game, and it was released in Japan on July 19th, 1996, and in North America on August 22nd, 1997, and in Europe in 1997 as well.
4229020	4232900	It is a multiplayer game for up to 10 players.
4233660	4245580	It is one of the top, I would say, rated Bomberman games, although it did get some criticism for not really pushing the series.
4246460	4250500	But at any rate, it has that battle mode and a story mode.
4250900	4259100	And then there's a master mode where you have to finish a series of levels where you're given rank based on how much time is taken.
4259620	4265140	And so you have a scoreboard for how fast you do and you get different power ups.
4265140	4266460	Of course, there's new ones.
4266780	4271100	Saturn Bomberman brings in dinosaur helpers, which are found as eggs.
4271100	4281820	And when you release, they're released when you destroy a soft block and there are babies, adolescents and adults in the appropriate strength level.
4282460	4289180	They can take one hit and you can ride the dinosaur and basically they act as your Yoshi.
4289540	4291900	They get hit, you're OK.
4293220	4295380	You have different power ups.
4295380	4303700	The special meter that slowly builds up and once the meter is full, your dinosaur will grow a level from baby to adolescent and adolescent to adult.
4304340	4306020	But in battle mode, it's a little differently.
4306020	4309500	When you collect an egg riding the dinosaur, the dinosaur will grow.
4310460	4312620	And then you can jump off the dinosaur at any time.
4314660	4326340	So basically, the story mode for this is that you blow up poles with red orbs that are called Zarfs while destroying your enemies and blowing up blocks and getting power ups.
4326340	4333140	And then once you clean up all the Zarfs, you get an exit and can go and you do a victory pose and there's a cut scene.
4333820	4335780	The battle mode.
4335780	4340380	So this is where it gets interesting.
4341220	4344500	So you need two multitaps for this.
4345460	4356940	Seven players can connect on one multitap or you can just play two, but you also can go against bots in the game.
4356940	4367700	If you have more than eight players, you get a widescreen arena that shrinks the characters down.
4367700	4374860	It's a little bit, it makes the play field area very large, but it disables some power ups, including the dinosaurs.
4375820	4382740	The North American version also supports the Sega Netlink for up to four players online.
4383740	4386380	They were pretty split over this.
4386380	4399460	Like I said, you know, a lot of people thought that this was an amazing addition, that the power ups in the system was just pretty, pretty awesome.
4399460	4406820	You know, having the 10 players set up was also pretty great, but there were some people who thought it just didn't do enough.
4407820	4415660	They think that it's still too much classic Bomberman and didn't add anything fresh to it.
4419180	4430540	That's really been the only thing, but not everyone was fully sold on the 10 player feature as well because of the screen size and losing the power ups and whatnot.
4430540	4436460	AGM said it was a mediocre one player game, but a fantastic multiplayer game.
4436500	4443900	And honestly, I've only ever played this multiplayer, so I think the biggest party I played with was a six person party.
4447180	4458780	They also said the graphics and music weren't super great, but this one itself, you know, like I said, this one, this one was just a really fun group game.
4458780	4461780	I mean, in the end, that's what it was meant for.
4462580	4469100	It was ranked as the second best Saturn game of 1997 with Fighters Megamix being right above it.
4469500	4471580	I don't know if I've done Fighters Megamix, I might need to.
4472740	4476980	In 2014, Retro Gamer placed this on their top 10 Saturn games list.
4477780	4486620	And I think that, yeah, it's a little divisive, but I think it's a fun game if you just look at it for what it is.
4487060	4491820	It's a Bomberman game and it's on the Saturn and you can have a lot of friends play with you.
4491820	4493700	This is an ultimate party game.
4496260	4497980	So there you go.
4498140	4501940	All right, your classic game of the week, Saturn Bomberman.
4501940	4503900	I was actually pretty surprised I've never done a Bomberman.
4505340	4509300	Oh, you haven't done any, but I thought you've done at least one of them.
4510100	4510620	Wow.
4511660	4513460	I looked and no Bombers came up.
4513860	4514700	Interesting.
4515700	4520340	I think I've done, I think I've done Star Parodia and I think that's the closest to Bomberman I got.
4520820	4521420	Interesting.
4522140	4522620	All right.
4523020	4529700	Well, I never played the Saturn one, but that party mode sounds really messy.
4529700	4530460	It's pretty epic.
4530700	4532260	It is messy though.
4532260	4538580	I mean, like when you get to the 10 player one, I'll be honest, it never really appealed to me in that respect.
4539500	4546700	But at the same time, I mean, it's, it's just, you know, it's Bomberman.
4546860	4548460	How can you go wrong with Bomberman?
4549020	4549540	All right.
4550220	4556780	Well, let's travel around and get some rapid fire news and some other topics really quickly here before we wrap up.
4556780	4559060	Yeah, we're going to move to wrap up here pretty soon, actually, folks.
4559060	4565100	Sorry, I know it's a little early, but as I said, just for a multitude of issues, we want to keep it a little shorter than usual tonight.
4565100	4567100	So sorry, but I'm sure you all understand.
4568100	4570380	So let's do some other quick headlines.
4570420	4570820	Loki.
4571780	4576140	Yeah, so itch.io is doing yet another queer games bundle.
4576140	4590780	I think we did something similar like this last year, but we have another bundle with 450 games, tabletop games, books, zines, albums, art, and from nearly 300 queer creators, all for 60 bucks.
4591220	4597900	The price of one AAA game, you can get 450 pieces of games and all sorts of other things.
4598980	4599660	So that's pretty cool.
4600060	4608060	And I have no idea what's in that in that bundle, but it's probably a lot of stuff.
4608100	4613620	I have way too much stuff on itch.io that I've not touched, but I'll still probably buy it.
4614620	4622100	And PlayStation Plus has announced their monthly games lineup for June 2023.
4622220	4627620	So you're going to be getting with games of the plus NBA 2K23.
4628260	4631140	And we have Jurassic World Evolution 2.
4631180	4634340	Those are both are going to be on PlayStation five and PlayStation four.
4634340	4638420	And last but not least, Trek de Yomi is going to be on both as well.
4640540	4641020	All right.
4641940	4645340	I think I gave you the same link twice for Xbox Game Pass.
4645340	4648860	Sorry, we can come back and do those at the end if you want to find the right link in the showroom.
4650020	4656700	Let me go to Dark Sakura first, then when I saw this headline, I instantly thought of you.
4657380	4662300	Yeah, and it's going to be too much for me to do the preorder as much as I want it.
4663260	4673940	But Cotton 100%, which is a SNES classic or a Super Famicom classic is being re-released for September 2023 date.
4674340	4678380	It will be roughly 55 bucks.
4678380	4681900	It comes with a brand new art reminiscent of the original.
4683140	4684900	I'll be more specific about it.
4685460	4688940	It says delivery date between September 26th and October 5th.
4689780	4696060	So around late September, it's 7,678 yen.
4696420	4700300	Now the delivery price on this of the release date of September 21st.
4700300	4700820	There you go.
4701700	4707180	Gosh, the delivery on this is 2,416 yen.
4707740	4710060	But oh, my gosh, I want it so much.
4710300	4711180	I love Cotton.
4712540	4715740	But it's not the only game that they're doing this with.
4715740	4723340	I think I'm just looking at some of the upcoming stuff available.
4725780	4730060	No, actually, I think Cotton is the only one that's getting the release like that.
4730060	4738660	I thought I saw other stuff, but yeah, there's Battletoads.
4739940	4744700	Looks like Battletoads is a resale version of the scenes of it.
4745340	4750740	And there's a Mega Drive game on here, too, which is.
4754540	4755580	I don't recognize the game.
4755580	4757940	Oh, a Glalancer.
4759540	4762940	Yeah, so I'm seeing a few things on there for other things,
4762940	4767780	but they also have a bunch of like retro knockoff systems meant to play things.
4769580	4773820	But but yeah, I mean, Cotton, shit.
4774860	4775620	I love that game.
4776460	4776940	All right.
4777340	4783180	Well, we had brought it up earlier in the show, but just to officially recap, Summer
4783180	4793180	Game Stunt Quick did happen this last week and the official final total $2,239,204 for
4793180	4799140	Doctors Without Borders, or I believe that's Merica San Fronteras is that's why it's
4799140	4799980	MSF USA.
4803500	4804700	It's Doctors Without Borders.
4804780	4806020	Yeah, but it's Doctors Without Borders.
4806900	4810460	And yeah, they raised quite a bit of money there.
4810460	4813580	That's certainly no small amount to blink at.
4813580	4815420	That's a great job by All Done.
4815940	4822220	Some folks are noting it's not as much as was raised last year, but there's probably a
4822220	4823900	few things that come into play with that.
4824180	4828060	Again, Bobby went into this in depth on his show, so I won't recap it too much.
4828060	4832900	But something to kind of consider is that if you look at the timing that this year's
4832900	4834980	event happened, it was really different from other years.
4835260	4841340	Usually this happens pretty close to my birthday and OLR's birthday, which is the end
4841340	4841820	of June.
4842860	4844580	We're close to the end of June right now.
4844620	4847340	So I would say timing is probably a part of that.
4847340	4851900	But again, I will defer to Bobby's show tonight who gets a little more into it tonight.
4851900	4855180	But again, I don't I don't think we should be like, oh, no, it didn't raise as much.
4855580	4858940	I guess it still raised 2.2 million dollars.
4858940	4861100	When was the last time you raised that kind of money?
4861900	4866340	That's a great amount of money for a very worthy cause.
4866340	4869460	So congratulations to everyone that was involved with that.
4871020	4873980	All right, Loki, do you want to talk about Xbox Game Pass real quick?
4874300	4878260	Yeah, so Game Pass is getting quite a few games for the month of June.
4878580	4884180	So we have Chicory, A Colorful Tale that's both on console and PC, as well as cloud.
4884860	4888100	Far World Pioneers on console and PC.
4888740	4892780	We have Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 on all three.
4893180	4897860	Slayer's X, Terminal Aftermath, Vengeance of the Slayer on all three.
4898180	4901060	The Big Con, that's also all three.
4901060	4902380	Amnesia, The Bunker.
4902980	4909220	We've got Hypno Space Outlaw, Rune Factory 4 Special, Stacking.
4909220	4915260	Let's see, Dord, I have no idea how to pronounce.
4915260	4917420	I'm going to butcher this, but that's fine.
4917420	4920660	It looks like Dordogne, I guess.
4921100	4923220	That's coming out on all three as well.
4923700	4926980	And then apparently there's going to be.
4927220	4930220	Oh, gosh, there's still more.
4930220	4932580	OK, well, we've got Super Mega Baseball 4.
4932700	4937020	That's going to be early access with I guess that's EA Play.
4937420	4943900	And then Supress, the Superlands, Six Inches Under Battlefield 2040.
4943900	4946980	And this is like I think this is DLC game updates.
4946980	4948580	So Tales and Trails.
4948580	4953420	Yeah, of course, that's Minecraft stuff leaving games past.
4953420	4957500	We've got our bridge constructor portal that's going to be leaving.
4957500	4962020	Chorus, Maneater, Mortal Shell, Serious Sam 4 and Total War Three Kingdoms.
4962940	4966340	There were some updates to that leaving list, by the way, since the time
4966340	4968580	that that was published, because apparently it's out there now that
4968900	4972140	on the 15th of the month, some pretty heavy hitters are going to be leaving.
4972140	4975020	Among Us is leaving Game Pass, which was a pretty heavy hitter
4975020	4975540	when that came out.
4975540	4979420	And Shredder's Revenge, the Ninja Turtles game, is going to be leaving Game Pass.
4979900	4982500	That would be that's been about a year since that came out, right?
4982500	4985420	So maybe the year kind of ran out on that.
4985420	4987180	So but that was still a little surprising.
4987180	4990820	I was like, oh, Game Pass kind of been taking some hits,
4990820	4993300	but I think something to really keep in mind.
4993300	4997300	And again, as we start to get to the end of the show.
4998660	5002580	This weekend, coming weekend, and by the time we're on our next show,
5002940	5005060	going to be huge, especially for Microsoft.
5005060	5006380	Don't forget, everyone.
5006380	5010660	Microsoft doing a big event Sunday morningish, afternoonish.
5010700	5012420	It's around isn't around like 11 a.m.
5012420	5014060	I don't remember the exact time.
5014060	5016620	Somebody in chat needs to jump in, please.
5016620	5019900	But they're also doing the Starfield Direct as well.
5019900	5023020	So they're kind of doing the deep dive on Starfield and Microsoft announcements.
5023340	5025660	So we'll find out what else Microsoft's doing this holiday.
5025660	5028820	And I don't think it's unrealistic to expect.
5028820	5031420	There will be stealth Game Pass releases that they have not been.
5031700	5035260	That is common with these Microsoft events is there's at least one game.
5035260	5037500	They'll be like, and it's on Game Pass today.
5037500	5041300	So even though it kind of feels like there's not much coming to Game Pass,
5041300	5047260	I wonder if they haven't been stockpiling them a little bit to dump with this.
5047580	5051540	Dark to see also reminding us Summer Game Fest is also Thursday.
5051580	5053500	So there's going to be a lot that happens with that.
5054420	5056060	There's no way I can simulcast that.
5056060	5059820	Anything that happens during the day now, there's no way I can simulcast it.
5060740	5061860	I guess I didn't mention it.
5061860	5065460	I'll say I got a I got a promotion at work, which is great.
5065460	5066260	And, you know, all that.
5066260	5072180	But it just means more time that I just I have so much to do right now.
5072660	5074740	So, yeah, I can't pull away for that.
5074740	5077900	I wish these things were in the evening, but I understand because of time zones,
5077900	5081060	they want to do a lot of these things because like one o'clock
5081540	5086100	L.A. time is like nine o'clock in the UK.
5086340	5089300	So I understand why they want to do things when they do.
5090100	5093100	But yeah, it just sucks during the day I can't simulcast.
5093100	5096020	But I'll definitely be checking out the footnotes after the fact,
5096020	5098300	because I'm really curious to see what they do announce from the event for sure.
5099180	5101100	So. All right.
5101900	5104260	Yeah. Next week's show, we're going to have a lot more stories
5104260	5107220	and hopefully I won't be feeling like shit. All right.
5108220	5112100	Let's do some release dates of what's coming out this week.
5112100	5114820	Loki in the US, what's coming out this week?
5114820	5117940	This week, we have Amnesia, the bunker
5118580	5124180	that's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Xbox series.
5125220	5128540	Diablo four is finally coming out for everybody else that didn't preorder.
5128540	5133300	That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
5133980	5136780	Loop eight, Summer of the Gods.
5136900	5141580	That's on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.
5142340	5145580	Raiden three cross
5145820	5150500	Mikado Maniacs, and that's on PC,
5151060	5155700	Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.
5156260	5158500	We have finally a US one.
5158500	5160820	It is interesting.
5161180	5162700	The Mikado soundtracks are pretty cool.
5163700	5167780	We have a Bleak Sword DX on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5168300	5172420	Harmony, The Fall of Reverie on PC and Nintendo Switch.
5172940	5175980	Pro Cycling Manager on 2023.
5175980	5180580	That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
5181100	5186620	And to go along with that, of course, Tour de France 2023 on PC,
5186860	5190780	PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.
5190940	5192500	And that is it.
5193380	5195740	All right, let's go over to Japan.
5195740	5198100	Japan actually a little slower on releases this week.
5198660	5202780	The only release on the Nintendo Switch this week is the Telenet shooting collection.
5203180	5208580	That's a collection of four games, classic titles from PC Engine and Genesis era.
5208580	5210380	These seem like dark soccer games.
5210380	5215340	Granada, Avenger, Gyruss, and Psychic Storm are in this collection.
5215340	5219020	Psychic Storm. OK, we have stories about Psychic Storm.
5219020	5223340	I'm sure you have been around where Dan and I have gone, I get pissed off like that.
5224340	5228780	That is a direct reference to them saying Psychic Storm in Psychic Storm
5228780	5230380	because it sounds like I get pissed off.
5230380	5232020	I see. OK.
5232860	5236980	And it's like, Psychic Storm, but it's I get pissed off for us.
5236980	5239500	Got it. Yeah. Anyway, one game.
5239500	5242460	And then the only release for the PlayStation five in Japan this week.
5242460	5243380	Actually, there are two.
5243380	5247500	MotoGP23 is out this week in Japan on Japan.
5248500	5249700	On June the 8th.
5249700	5254140	But just like the rest of the world, Japan is also getting Diablo four on June the 6th.
5254140	5257260	So if you were wondering, is that game coming out of Japan?
5257260	5258900	Yes, it is. It is still coming out there.
5258900	5260300	It's a worldwide release, really.
5260300	5266860	So because not everything Blizzard does goes to Japan because infamously World Warcraft is not available in Japan for whatever reason.
5266860	5272620	So not the people there aren't playing it, but it's not officially released in Japan.
5273420	5274620	How about the UK, Dark Sakura?
5275500	5282500	So in the UK, on the 6th for Xbox and PlayStation, we have Diablo four for Switch.
5282500	5287140	We have Loop eight Summer of Gods on the 8th for the three.
5287140	5291260	We have MotoGP23 on the 9th for Switch.
5291260	5294460	We have Toy Soldiers for PlayStation and Switch.
5294460	5297540	We have Garden Simulator for PlayStation and Xbox.
5297540	5303460	We have Miasma Chronicles on PlayStation, Death or Treat.
5304020	5304780	Love the name.
5306300	5309220	Also for PlayStation, Seeker My Shadow.
5310580	5311540	That's Eastall.
5312180	5312660	All right.
5313540	5316700	Well, with that, folks, we have reached the end of the show.
5316700	5322380	I know it's it was a little shorter tonight, but I think I've laid out why it's still an hour and a half is actually pretty good.
5322380	5325020	So thank you all for being here.
5325020	5325940	I appreciate it.
5326140	5330820	Let me quickly go to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories you want to cover tonight.
5337020	5339780	Loki, hey, do you have any last minute stories?
5339780	5340460	You all right over there?
5341140	5341900	Yeah, I'm OK.
5341900	5343820	I was looking for last minute stories.
5343820	5346220	And no, we have no last minute stories.
5346220	5348940	I was going to say, I didn't seem like a lot a lot happened this week.
5348940	5353660	But again, you know, with E3 week would have been this upcoming week.
5353860	5357700	I think a lot of it was probably being saved for this next week.
5357700	5362660	So I fully expect next week's going to be a pretty big show with that.
5362660	5366060	I guess there's one thing I guess I guess you mentioned this really minor.
5366060	5378460	But apparently the developers that were going to be doing the Knights of the Old Republic to restoration DLC on Switch said that they're not going to be able to do that.
5378460	5379860	Oh, I'm glad you brought this up.
5379860	5381540	This is a big deal for that community.
5382060	5382420	Yeah.
5382420	5390140	So instead, Aspire is going to be offering some free replacement games instead.
5390140	5399900	So if you are affected by this, if you preorder this, you can get whether they have Coder 2, the Sith Lords on Steam.
5400700	5409340	They've got Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic on Switch, The Force Unleashed, Republic Commando, Episode One, Episode One Racer, Jedi Knight,
5409380	5414580	Jedi Academy or Jedi Knight 2, Jedi Outcast on Switch as well.
5414900	5417420	So, yeah, that that sucks.
5417420	5420380	Which if you're a Star Wars fan, you probably already owned all those Switch games.
5420380	5421100	So, right.
5421100	5422980	I mean, it's not like this is a brand new game.
5422980	5424740	It's just, you know, yeah, yeah.
5426100	5426700	All right.
5427340	5430500	Well, let's and I should shout out the mailbag.
5430500	5432820	I don't think we had any new emails tonight anyway, but I will.
5432820	5433620	We had garbage.
5433620	5438780	Yeah, I will mention participate at orangesontrader.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
5438780	5441060	Again, that's participate at orangesontrader.com.
5441060	5443420	I imagine we might get a couple after Summer Game Fest this week.
5443420	5443900	We'll see.
5444140	5451940	I have put out a call, by the way, for at least two cat pictures with nerdy stuff in them.
5451940	5453020	No, no people.
5453300	5460660	I want like video game memorabilia or the old Miitomo thing, you know, stuff like that.
5460700	5463740	Oh, yeah, because you're talking about updating the intro, huh?
5464380	5464700	Right.
5464700	5465540	And I need cheddar.
5465580	5467180	I was gonna say I need to get you cheddar picks then.
5467980	5481300	That actually is timed really well because our 21st anniversary, dot, dot, dot, is in three weeks on the 25th would be our 21st anniversary show.
5481500	5484060	This show is now old enough to drink.
5484820	5486260	So there's that.
5486860	5488460	Don't we have other stuff we could be doing?
5488500	5490780	Well, putting together cat pictures into a collage.
5490780	5491860	Clearly, that's one of them.
5492260	5494740	So okay, I mean, I was talking about like napping.
5494780	5496580	Def says, what's the due date for that?
5496580	5499940	If we want to make that happen by the June 25th show, then what's the due date for that?
5502820	5503620	Two weeks.
5503660	5504380	Two weeks.
5505340	5508500	As today, SSJ 100 Matt would like to submit a dog.
5510220	5512860	I guess put cat ears on it'll be fine.
5514580	5516060	I think we can allow Matt's dog.
5516060	5516540	He's cute.
5517060	5517540	Yeah.
5517580	5517980	All right.
5518340	5519060	Just this once.
5519060	5521500	Dog exceptions on a case by case basis.
5522460	5524580	Ferrets are 1000% allowed.
5525580	5529980	Actually, for Def, we should allow other animals too, if he wants.
5530220	5532780	Yeah, we can have other animals.
5532780	5533300	Absolutely.
5534820	5538020	I'm gonna have to change this to O.L.R.
5538020	5539180	Cats and friends.
5539460	5542100	Yeah, cats and friends, because we all know cats are in charge.
5542340	5543020	Absolutely.
5543020	5544620	The cats rule the stoop.
5545100	5545620	All right.
5545620	5547900	With that, we're gonna wrap up the show for tonight.
5547900	5550100	So that's it.
5550100	5552500	Thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio.
5552500	5554660	If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show.
5554660	5557220	Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5557220	5558900	But we need more voices to put out on air.
5559140	5563780	So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you heard the show.
5563780	5565140	Those go an awful long way.
5565140	5566340	So please consider that.
5567540	5569660	In the meantime, we'll get everybody's final thoughts.
5569660	5575380	So Dark Sakura, I guess you get to get an early start tonight if you want on your post show shenanigans.
5576260	5579900	Well, that means that, well, actually, I'm going to have a Shayla with me.
5579900	5584940	I do not know about a Fixie, because I think Fixie is with their significant other.
5585380	5593100	But yeah, I'm going to do some entertainment and ending things and stuff.
5594060	5594540	All right.
5594780	5596340	Well, do you have a final thought for us tonight?
5596900	5599500	I don't have any thoughts.
5599540	5604980	Oh, I guess I'll just go ahead and say, you know, again, we miss you, Peppers.
5605100	5607940	I'm glad you're not hurting and may your memory be a blessing.
5608820	5609220	All right.
5609540	5610300	Well, thanks, Jamie.
5610300	5611380	We'll talk to you next week.
5612180	5613100	I guess.
5613220	5613740	All right.
5615060	5615540	Bye.
5615820	5616180	All right.
5616460	5617620	Loki, your final thought tonight?
5618580	5625820	Just going to be working hard on more Minecraft content, just rushing to get stuff down or stuff done, I guess.
5626660	5628180	Lots of work on, lots to do.
5628860	5629260	All right.
5629700	5634260	And my final thought is I really hope I'm feeling better tomorrow because I do want to get to streaming some Diablo 4.
5634260	5638460	I'm actually a little bit pained that I haven't been able to stream the early hours of the game.
5638500	5640020	But it is what it is.
5640020	5643260	Even doing this tonight, I'm already like, oh, it's pressure.
5644100	5647380	So I'm going to go treat myself to a nap.
5647380	5650020	So on that thought, we have a busy week ahead.
5650020	5652900	I think we all need a nap because it's going to be a big week in gaming this week.
5652900	5658700	So we will be here in seven days to digest all the news from Summer Game Fest, Microsoft's press event.
5659460	5663340	I keep saying press event, but it's really, you know, gamer direct conference or whatever you want to call it.
5663900	5668060	And whatever other surprises might be dropped on us this week, I assume there it may not end there.
5668060	5669300	We may have some other surprises this week.
5669300	5672020	So we'll talk about all of that next week on the show.
5672020	5674180	In the meantime, I hope you all have a wonderful week.
5674220	5675660	Thank you so much for being here.
5675820	5683820	And I am now going to roll the credits, which, by the way, DJ Rama S subbed the credits out and made good on her promise from last week.
5683820	5689180	So that being said, those on the podcast are going to hear something different behind as we outro tonight.
5689180	5689820	Good night, everybody.
