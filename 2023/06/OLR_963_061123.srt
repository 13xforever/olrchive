1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,600
It's still a weird era.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,000
Business people get advice from business people about what supposedly made them successful,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,440
forgetting how much of it wasn't in their hands to begin with and never will be.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,040
Twitch thinks their TV network can control all their content, so their rules about advertising

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,440
went over about as well as could be expected.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,520
Time flows like a river, and history repeats.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,200
Please support the people that do the work.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,160
This is the One Step Forward, Five Leaps Back intro.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,520
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every

11
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,520
gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,140
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,920
where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,160
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,920
We are live once again, episode number 963 of our show for tonight, June 11th, 2023.

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,600
It's a little bit of a busy week in gaming.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,160
We got a lot to get into, but first, let's introduce ourselves and get off topic.

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,480
My name is Rob Roberts.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,860
I'm here with you every week, joined by my co-hosts, the one and only Dark Sakura or

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,860
Jamie Summers.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,860
I'm mad at popcorn.

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,860
I need to go get some more.

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,860
That is a shame.

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:23,900
You might need some popcorn tonight with all the cutscenes, cinematics, epics, games coming.

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,360
It's delicious kettle corn.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
The best.

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
My favorite.

28
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
The best.

29
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,160
After my day, I need it.

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,080
Let me cycle back to that real quick, but first, let me say hello as well to Tech Master

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
Loki.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Hello.

33
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Hi, Loki.

34
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
How are you?

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Doing good.

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,540
Trying to figure out the game behind you playing, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday

37
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,680
night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of the Geeks Network, twitch.tv

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,680
slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
You can see video.

40
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
It is a podcast.

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
We try to be mindful of that and keep it very audio based, but sometimes there's just some

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
fun little things on the video, and the one is I'm trying to figure out what that game

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,880
is playing behind Loki on his little webcam tonight.

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,160
It was a Super Nintendo game.

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,480
Is it the one with the guy playing the banjo on the cover?

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
No.

47
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
That's-

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
No.

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
That's a shooter game.

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Equinox or something like that.

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
No.

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,480
Equinox was a Sony game.

53
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,520
Flannix, I think, was a game.

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
That game.

55
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Yeah.

56
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Yeah.

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
This is Cybernator.

58
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,600
Oh, because there was an NES version of that, wasn't there, or an earlier version or something?

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I thought.

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Maybe.

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Maybe.

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Maybe.

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,600
Maybe.

64
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
There's a game that was similar.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Yeah.

66
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Okay.

67
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
I don't remember.

68
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Well, Dark Tetsuya and chat got it.

69
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Ding, ding, ding.

70
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Maybe Cybernator.

71
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
So, there it is.

72
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
You got it.

73
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Yes, and Flannix was the game I was trying to think of with the epic-

74
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Hey, Link.

75
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
No.

76
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
The guy playing the banjo.

77
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,040
It's the banjo game because the box art was this infamous guy playing the banjo that had

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,400
literally nothing to do with the game.

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
I don't know why-

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,440
And it intrigued you, and you had to rent it then, and you're like-

81
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Yeah.

82
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,640
It really was one of those things where it's like, I have to rent this because I don't

83
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,800
know what the hell this is.

84
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,040
I really don't.

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,920
I'm not able to find a very large picture of this box art, but I found a little tiny

86
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,400
one there that I can put on stream.

87
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
That's what it looked like.

88
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,160
It's honestly a game I should cover because it was a completely different game and had

89
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,960
a really good X68000 release.

90
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Mm-hmm.

91
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Yeah, it's-

92
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Of course.

93
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,160
Dark Tetsuya says, I mean, people still talk about it 30 years later, so mission accomplished.

94
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Clearly.

95
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
Clearly mission accomplished.

96
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
All right.

97
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,840
We are going to get into some gaming news, but first, Dark Sakura, I know you were talking

98
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,000
about your day, and I wanted to give you some space to vent if you need it.

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,560
Oh, it's not really a vent per se.

100
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,360
I had posted earlier that Midna was having some problems.

101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,320
She had been twitching on her jaw.

102
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,800
Her lower jaw would just twitch, and she'd be licking the top of her mouth, and she was

103
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,120
drooling excessively, but she didn't have bad breath.

104
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:23,920
The biggest sign that she would have had stomatitis, I believe it is, which is a more advanced,

105
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:31,280
terrible form of gingivitis, so she didn't have bad breath or anything, and she was doing

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,040
other stuff, but whenever I'd go to wipe her mouth with a towel, she'd hiss really badly.

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
That was yesterday.

108
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,240
My friend Heather, she was a vet tech.

109
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,080
I sent her videos, but because Midna didn't have the bad breath or anything, we were thinking

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,400
that it might be neurological, like she had a seizure or an episode or something, until

111
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:03,840
I sent her a video of Midna eating and trying to get in my face to take some bonito flakes.

112
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,640
We saw her tooth was at a 45-degree angle.

113
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,560
Her appointment was on Tuesday.

114
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,560
I didn't know if I needed to get her into an emergency vet, so I couldn't find my forceps

115
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,280
either, so I sterilized some pliers, and I was just going to see, is it loose?

116
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,640
I barely touched it, and it came out, so Midna's feeling better.

117
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:37,880
She started eating almost immediately, little hog, cleaning herself.

118
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,720
She's over on the other chair, just chilling.

119
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,640
For anyone who is like, oh no, no way in this thing, it just came out.

120
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
It just came out.

121
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,880
I hardly did it.

122
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,520
It just needed a little push.

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,120
Or a pull in this case.

124
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,760
It wiggled once and came out, and Midna didn't act any other way.

125
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,280
In fact, she seemed pretty happy when it was gone.

126
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:18,720
I do have some Chloracin, which is an antibacterial mouth rinse, although they put orange flavor

127
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,640
in it, which is stupid, because citrus scents and flavors are a deterrent to cats.

128
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
They hate them.

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:36,440
Midna's extra pissed off about that, but she's still going to get it used for a few days.

130
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:44,560
And yeah, she's probably going to be on some antibiotics after I take her to the vet, because

131
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,240
I don't want it to get infected.

132
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm just afraid that they might need to see if there's any more debris in there, and that's

133
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,360
the part where I don't know if I'm going to have all the money for that, but on a completely

134
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,520
unrelated topic, I have the world's smallest Birkin bag.

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,600
For anyone who doesn't know, it's actually a miniature version of an Hermes Birkin in

136
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:18,400
a nice cappuccino color, and I got a traction machine, but I think they sent me the wrong

137
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:28,240
one, and yeah, that's been my IRL week, but mostly it's just been Midna for the last couple

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,480
of days, and she was so miserable.

139
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,920
If I had seen it sooner, I could have yanked that tooth out, but at least she's done this

140
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
time.

141
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,920
At least it's done now, and she's doing better now.

142
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Yeah.

143
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Yeah.

144
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm a cat surgeon.

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Just kidding.

146
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm not.

147
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
All right.

148
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
I'm keeping the tooth.

149
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Cats are important.

150
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:55,440
I want to say a bit of a personal note before we get into the gaming news, because I just

151
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,640
made an announcement at the end of Bobby's show here.

152
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,880
I want to make sure I repeat it here for the OLR audience, and that is I'm not going to

153
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,280
be making one trip to Atlanta this year.

154
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm going to be making two.

155
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm very excited to announce I'm going to be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo the weekend

156
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,840
of July 28th through the 30th, and this is at the Marriott Renaissance Waverly where

157
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,840
that's happening.

158
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,520
It's very similar in many ways to the show out here that's California Extreme, but they

159
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,240
have some celebrity guests, and it's been getting bigger and bigger, and it's their

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,600
10th anniversary year out there, so I'm very excited to go out and take part in that.

161
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Check that out.

162
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,640
I'm hoping to be involved with some panels and do some fun things out there that weekend

163
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
in July.

164
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:46,760
July 28th through the 30th, the Southern Fried Gaming Expo in Atlanta, and I will also still

165
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,240
this year be at Dragon Con, so I'm taking two trips to Atlanta about five weeks apart,

166
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,880
but the Southern Fried trip is only a long weekend.

167
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,840
I literally get in on a Thursday night, and I go out Monday morning.

168
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,320
It's just a long weekend.

169
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Dragon Con, I'm there for an entire week as usual, because Dragon Con is a very long con,

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
but yeah.

171
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,160
Man, any excuse you can to beat Bobby's score at pinball, I mean, I swear.

172
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
Right?

173
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Well, the nice-

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
This rivalry's getting out of control.

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,520
The nice thing about Southern Fried Gaming Expo is that they have an entire room filled

176
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,000
with pinball games that I can get the high score on, or at least, if nothing else, I

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,960
probably won't get the high, high score, because there's a lot of very good players there,

178
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,800
but at least beat Bobby's score on as many of the machines as possible, because he can't

179
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,040
ban me from that arcade as long as I am a registered member of the con, which I will

180
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
be.

181
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,640
So yes, I'm looking forward to my stupid beginner's luck.

182
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,040
You know that's all it is, is stupid beginner's luck, because I think I talked about it last

183
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,440
week, or a couple weeks ago on the show, when I was in San Diego for work, one of the nights

184
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,200
I went to a coin-op place there that had some pinball games, and I played that Avengers

185
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,440
table for the first time, and I won a free game twice.

186
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,360
That's how ridiculous my beginner's luck was on that table, so there is that, but that's

187
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,840
why I love the Stern connected thing, because when nobody believes me that I did that, I

188
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,560
can be like, see, I have the score and the achievements to prove it, my little Stern

189
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,600
insider thing, so that's something they're doing very well.

190
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,860
All right.

191
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:28,300
Let's get into a lot of gaming news from this week, because this would have been E3 week,

192
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,820
this coming week would have been E3 week, but obviously not happening, but what did

193
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,540
happen, Summer Game Fest this last week, and then of course this morning, Xbox had a showcase.

194
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,300
So let's start, and then there's actually other things been going on as well, but we're

195
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,660
going to start tonight talking about Summer Game Fest, which happened a few days ago.

196
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,380
Unfortunately, I was not able to watch this live.

197
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,700
I had to get kind of a recap of this, but I kind of caught up on all the news and what

198
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
happened.

199
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,860
So first, let's talk about the Prince of Persia, Lost Crown.

200
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,700
So this is a game that's kind of like a 2.5D adventure, it looks a little more like a classic

201
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,460
Prince of Persia title than one of the newer titles.

202
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,680
This is going to be coming out in January, January 18th, 2024, assuming it doesn't get

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,460
delayed or anything.

204
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,540
But this honestly, right off the bat, this is probably one of the more exciting titles

205
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,040
out of the whole showcase for me.

206
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,060
So I'm definitely down with Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown, and sort of finding the roots

207
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,580
a little bit of the series.

208
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,980
Another, we went right from that into Mortal Kombat 1.

209
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,480
We are starting over, says the Mortal Kombat team.

210
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,460
As they go into Mortal Kombat 1, they really did some in-depth gameplay for this, and then

211
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,820
some of the crazy changes that are going on as well, and the Cameo system, which will

212
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,460
let you call in additional characters to help during a fight.

213
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,180
So you can bring in Baraka, Goro, Striker, and Sonya are some examples of Cameo fighters.

214
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:03,300
So that's an interesting kind of, it feels very like Capcom fighter from the 90s, where

215
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
you would tag team people.

216
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,620
They don't take it, they just come in to do a move.

217
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,340
There was absolutely a Capcom fighter like that, more than one.

218
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,700
Yeah, more than one.

219
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,980
There's several where you just tag them in and they do a move.

220
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,620
That one, Superheroes and Street Fighters, the one I definitely remember.

222
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,740
So that'll be fun.

223
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,420
So Mortal Kombat 1, I think people are very excited about.

224
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,380
That is coming out September 19th.

225
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,600
So the nice thing about the Mortal Kombat team, they usually don't tease games until

226
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,760
they're about ready to go.

227
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,740
So Mortal Kombat 1 is out in just a few months.

228
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,180
Sonic Superstars, this looked kind of cool too.

229
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,140
This is going to involve multiple playable characters, co-op gameplay for up to four

230
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,420
people and you can run up walls and waterfalls.

231
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:53,100
That's going to be out for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X, and Nintendo Switch all this

232
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
fall.

233
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,220
So a little bit more of like a, I don't, I always say like a kind of like more of a game

234
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,180
in Sonic's roots a little bit.

235
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:09,100
Because it's not, it's not like the more recent title, but it definitely looks, it looks very

236
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
cool.

237
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,140
It's a bit more like Mania, you know, like more of the classics on the game, the last

238
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,460
one they went really in the other direction, everyone's like, no, don't do that.

239
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,820
Well, the vibe I kind of get from it, honestly, and not, not completely, but like just a vibe

240
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,420
is the new Super Mario Brothers games that were on like Wii U and stuff, which were four

241
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
player.

242
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,740
That's kind of like the vibe I get from it.

243
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,460
It's kind of like that, but for Sonic, but like not a literal clone, like it's, it's

244
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,980
doing its very Sonic thing.

245
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,300
Like these, it looks very chaotic and fun, honestly.

246
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,340
Yeah, I think this Sonic title, I'm going to be quite honest, looks more exciting than

247
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,300
a lot of Sonic titles have been in a long time for me, just because it invokes like

248
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,020
that classic Sonic feel to it.

249
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,380
You know what I mean?

250
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,540
So Sonic Superstars, really looking forward to that.

251
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,020
A horror game called Toxic Commando is coming from one of the all time greats in horror,

252
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,940
John Carpenter and Saber Interactive.

253
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:08,100
You'll be fighting zombies with guns and vehicles.

254
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,420
Yeah, just John Carpenter's name alone on this is going to make people pay attention.

255
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,020
I can't say I blame them for that.

256
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,180
And we got Spider-Man 2.

257
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,980
This is probably one of the other big reveals out of the whole thing.

258
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,740
We have a date, October 20th, exclusive to the PlayStation 5, of course.

259
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,980
We have Spider-Man 2 is going to be coming out and Queens and Brooklyn are fully explorable

260
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,020
in the game because it's a very open world type of game and rooted in New York.

261
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,720
So that'll be very cool.

262
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,000
If you are a Fortnite fan, chapter four, season three is coming out.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,900
It's called Wilds and the big new character in this is going to be Optimus Prime.

264
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,820
So if you want to play as a transformer in Fortnite, if you want to be a transformer

265
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:01,700
fighting Ariana Grande, wielding Jedi superpowers, Fortnite is now the game for you because it's

266
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,120
literally the blender of all these pop culture things, which is what they've been saying

267
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,620
for quite some time.

268
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,780
There's one more pretty major thing I'm going to let Dark Soccer talk about in a minute,

269
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,340
but I want to do some other quick hits here.

270
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,340
New trailer for Path of Exile 2.

271
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,660
Exo Primal is going to get some skins for the mechs based on Street Fighter 6, Ryu and

272
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
Guile.

273
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Tiny bit of a deeper dive on Nicolas Cage in Dead by Daylight.

274
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,420
And of course, Nicolas Cage actually showed up to basically give the, I'm Nicolas Cage

275
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,940
and I approve this message type of thing.

276
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,780
That's going to be coming out on July 25th.

277
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,780
His model doesn't look anything like him.

278
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
I mean, barely.

279
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
It's a mild resemblance.

280
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,300
It looks a lot like him.

281
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,340
Looks better.

282
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,180
It's hot Nicolas Cage, I'm on down with the model to be honest.

283
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,140
The facial structure is there, the expressions there, it's pretty dead on.

284
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,620
It's younger, which is, you know, it's fine.

285
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:00,780
I mean, it's meant to be a video game, it's Nick Cage.

286
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,660
Also The Witcher Season 3 Volume 1 had a new trailer.

287
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,300
Witchfire is going to be entering early access on the Epic Game Store September 20th.

288
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,100
New gameplay trailer showed off for Remnant 2, a live action trailer and a release date

289
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,620
in August for Crossfire Sierra Squad.

290
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,780
PlayStation 5 is going to be getting the game that I'm seeing more and more of on Twitch.

291
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,200
Honkai Star Rail is going to be coming out on PlayStation 5 during Quarter 4 this year.

292
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,960
That of course from the same people that brought Genshin Impact, so it's a similar

293
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,500
vibe, although it's a little more standard RPG mechanics from what I understand.

294
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,000
Lies of P got a demo and a release date of September 19th.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

296
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Sand Land based on Akira Toriyama's Sand Land, a game that's going to be based on that.

298
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,640
It's coming out.

299
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,620
Annapurna mentioned they're going to be doing their own showcase on June 29th to show off

300
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,780
some upcoming games.

301
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,680
New free-to-play MMO Throne and Liberty with a trailer, War Haven with a new trailer, Party

302
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:09,140
Animals with a release date, Dying Light 2 has some gameplay updates, Alan Wake 2 had

303
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,980
an extended gameplay video and Keely had interviewed Sam Lake on stage.

304
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,780
I think a lot of people are very excited about Alan Wake 2.

305
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,140
I'm definitely excited to see what music they've licensed for it because the first game had

306
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,460
an amazing soundtrack, that's for sure.

307
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:27,700
Yes, Your Grace Snowfall, which is a sequel, got a 2024 release window.

308
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,420
There was an awful lot going on.

309
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,460
A lot of it was finally some dates, really, for some things.

310
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,460
A limited Xbox Series X for the Porsche's 75th anniversary.

311
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,940
Star Trek Infinite, a 4X game from Paradox, is going to be coming out as well.

312
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,780
There's a game I missed that you wanted to mention, by all means do so, and there's one

313
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,780
more, actually.

314
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:59,620
Also we got a clip from the new Twisted Metal show, which, eh, is alright.

315
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,780
Loki's being very generous, in my opinion.

316
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:08,780
I guess maybe if you enjoy bad shit- Here's the thing, I know it's trash.

317
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,740
I know it's trash, it's like Fast Five, or like the Fast and the Furious series.

318
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,380
I know going in it's going to be trash.

319
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,380
I've set my expectation for trash.

320
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,380
I'm fine with that.

321
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:32,900
I like Anthony Mackie, and I like Will Arnett, so I'm ready for trash in the Twisted Metal

322
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
world.

323
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,260
I don't expect anything great out of it.

324
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:42,180
And I'm happy for you, Loki, and that's about where my excitement ends.

325
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,420
But in all seriousness, I think something all three of us can get behind, this was the

326
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,220
one that everyone was talking about, Dark Sakura.

327
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,460
What was the big, big reveal of this show?

328
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:59,220
It was Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is the second installation of the remake series.

329
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,460
And it's very pretty.

330
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Very pretty.

331
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,260
It's supposed to be like the middle part of the game, where you're outside wandering around,

332
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,140
going hither and yon.

333
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,260
It's very pretty.

334
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,180
I like the voice acting.

335
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:27,620
I can see where they're going with the foreshadowing in there too, so that's pretty good.

336
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,540
And I feel like they really are now flexing that they're going to do whatever the fuck

337
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
they want in this.

338
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,660
I mean, I know you mentioned they're following the story a little bit, but okay, there's

339
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,300
this whole interesting thing that came out about in the Japanese version of the trailer.

340
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,500
So something that happens towards the end of the trailer is that there's this whole

341
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,420
scene where it looks like Sephiroth is looking at Tifa or something, and he actually says

342
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,620
something in the Japanese trailer about, I killed Tifa or something like that.

343
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,360
I don't remember what the words were, but obviously they're not going to give away a

344
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,300
bombshell thing like that in the trailer.

345
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,220
It's obviously some type of mind fuck, like was it a fake version or an alternate reality

346
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,680
version because obviously there's something going on because you can't say I killed this

347
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,220
person and then the person is sitting right in front of you.

348
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,940
There's obviously some weird shit going on, but there's just that whole concept of, wait

349
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,120
a minute, they might kill somebody besides Aerith, which, spoiler alert, already happened

350
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:35,000
in the first game, and then he was brought back to life, but in the second game, clearly

351
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,060
they can do whatever they want.

352
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,060
But I just-

353
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
Hold on.

354
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Oh, what?

355
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,780
I'm going to see what he said.

356
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,620
I'm going to hear it for myself.

357
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Oh, okay.

358
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:51,220
Yeah, there's a translation version somewhere out there with subtitles.

359
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,940
But anyway, while you're checking that out, I will just mention, just because I've had

360
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,160
that kind of year, I do want to say about six years ago when this series was first announced,

361
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,260
I said they can do whatever the hell they want this time, and I think they'll kill Tifa

362
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,900
instead of Aerith just to get fanboys upset.

363
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:15,900
So by God, if that does come true, I'm writing a book, why I'm so goddamn smart at video

364
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,700
games by Rob Roberts.

365
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,860
One thing though I should point out is that the scene there, at least as far as how it

366
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,660
was in the old game, was from their flashback.

367
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:33,240
She wore that outfit as like a tour guide or something when they found the Genova facility

368
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,540
the first time.

369
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,980
So that's all in flashback.

370
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,260
So Mishkins in chat says, I feel like that might be a dream sequence, like someone's

371
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
having a dream.

372
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,860
And in it they say, I killed Tifa.

373
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Oh yeah, there's absolutely...

374
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,140
Well, they didn't say I killed Tifa, he said, I killed her.

375
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,140
Who is she?

376
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,300
No, they're talking about the Japanese version.

377
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,740
In the Japanese one, they say, yeah.

378
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:02,840
But here's the thing, look, it's not worth over-analyzing because they do misdirects

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,920
in movie trailers all the time.

380
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:11,600
Or because I love to relate everything to RuPaul's Drag Race, there was a scene in the

381
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,080
trailer for season five where Alaska goes, I've had it with everybody.

382
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,200
She goes, I fucking hate it here.

383
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,460
And then you find out it was like, she's acting.

384
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,860
And they got her to say that in the clip, like had nothing to do with her actually being

385
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,860
mad at anybody.

386
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,820
Like it's just, they do that type of misdirect shit all the time in trailers just to get

387
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
you riled up.

388
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,300
So, did you want to say anything else on that, Darcyra?

389
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,580
I listened to the phrase and he literally did said, I'm the one that killed Tifa.

390
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
Yeah.

391
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
So...

392
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,020
I went to listen to it.

393
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:51,220
But if you, again, I think in the very beginning of that trailer, you see all of the characters

394
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,540
coming out in stretchers and Midgar, so something weird's going on.

395
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,700
So it's, it's just, and if you played the first game, you know, there's all sorts of

396
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,780
weird timeline fuckery and things that have been altered from its original state and so

397
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
forth.

398
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:11,800
You know, it's, again, I can't keep hiding the major twists in Final Fantasy Remake from

399
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,660
you much longer because they're going to be essential to Rebirth and talking about the

400
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,340
game and why it's going to go in a different direction.

401
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:24,300
So but yeah, it's, I was very hyped for the trailer.

402
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,900
Oh, you know, the other part of the trailer that was huge news.

403
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,060
It says it's two discs.

404
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
Excuse me?

405
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,980
Taking all of your storage space.

406
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Excuse me?

407
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,820
This game is so big, you need two Blu-rays.

408
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:46,180
One Blu-ray disc is not enough to handle the second part of a game.

409
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,900
That's big news too, as far as I'm concerned.

410
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,180
RIP to the bandwidth caps of those that still have them for those that decide to get the

411
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,760
game digitally.

412
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
My goodness.

413
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,060
Well, if you have a PlayStation 5 digital edition.

414
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
Oops.

415
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Oops.

416
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,060
Yeah.

417
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:07,220
I hope you have unlimited bandwidth or something or you're going to be playing on the cloud.

418
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
I don't know.

419
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,500
Or you can maybe like download like the first part and then the second part the following

420
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
month or something like that.

421
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
I don't know.

422
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,740
Quest Buster does point out Horizon Forbidden West is also on two discs.

423
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,100
Oh, even on PS5 it was?

424
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
I did not know that.

425
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300
Okay.

426
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,180
But I'd also kind of believe it.

427
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,100
Quest Buster says, get a snack for long installs.

428
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,900
Mike Def says, 200 gigabytes plus updates.

429
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,200
Well, look Square, you better minimize those day one updates.

430
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,100
Let me tell you, because by the way, the other thing that they snuck in a pushback, did you

431
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,440
notice they snuck in a delay with that game as well?

432
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,660
Now it's quarter one 2024, because it was supposed to be this year, because remember

433
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,900
we were talking about, oh, Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 part two in the same

434
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
year.

435
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Wow.

436
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,120
And I, again, I don't want to toot my own horn, but I was saying several weeks ago,

437
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,000
it's probably going to slip in the first quarter.

438
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And here we are.

439
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,640
And, but it's, I don't think it's a big deal, especially now when you hear like exactly

440
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,580
how much is going into the game.

441
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,120
And quite frankly, again, if a delay can minimize those day one patches, I think most people

442
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,720
will be very grateful to hear it, quite honestly, so.

443
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,120
They've also been teasing things on Twitter about that game, basically that like, it ranges

444
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,640
from the really fucking obvious to the not so obvious, like, yes, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth

445
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:38,800
will have a new soundtrack with some new songs, as well as remixed songs from the original.

446
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,500
Holy fucking shit, what an announcement.

447
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,540
Like what a breaking news alarm of Final Fantasy 7.

448
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,540
Oh my god.

449
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,540
Video game to have soundtrack?

450
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,700
What?

451
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,700
You don't say.

452
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,540
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

453
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,540
What?

454
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
I just went back.

455
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,380
I know I keep going back to the thing you said, what he actually says is I should have

456
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,380
killed Tifa.

457
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,380
Hmm.

458
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,380
Interesting.

459
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,380
All right.

460
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,380
Well, look.

461
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,380
Anyway.

462
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,460
We'll find out in a few months.

463
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,500
But the other thing, then there also was one that said basically the developers feel you

464
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,980
don't have to play the first game to pick up this game, which is the smart thing to

465
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,260
do, you know, because let's be real, there are some people that are going to be 21 when

466
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,880
this game comes out that were like 16 or 17 when the other one came out.

467
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,540
And maybe they're just now getting around to buying their own PS5 and what have you,

468
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
you know, whatever.

469
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,620
There's a variety of reasons.

470
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,260
People may have just missed the first game or don't want to put the time into play it,

471
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,620
but want to play this one.

472
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,780
So it's nice that they'll have a catch up.

473
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,460
Here's the thing, though.

474
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,060
It doesn't mean it'll be a good catch up mechanic, but if they're smart, they'll put out one

475
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:56,100
of those things on YouTube that's like recapping the first Final Fantasy 7 game in seven minutes.

476
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,700
That's what they should do if they are, you know, wanting to make sure they get everybody

477
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,860
up to speed, which I mean, you could.

478
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,060
You could recap the key points of the game in seven minutes and be up to speed.

479
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,020
So we'll see.

480
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,700
All right.

481
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,780
That was Summer Game Fest.

482
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,260
How did you feel about it?

483
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,980
Did you watch the event live, Loki, or some of it?

484
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,980
Yes, I did.

485
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,980
What did you think?

486
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,300
Because again, I had to kind of watch the highlight reel after the fact.

487
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,660
I want to get your take on how was it live.

488
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,660
Do you think it was a worthy press event successor to some of the E3 hype?

489
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,820
Like, where's your head at with it?

490
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,740
It's about what it was last year.

491
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
It wasn't anything.

492
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,100
It was like, it was all right.

493
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,420
You know, still hoping for granted that six trailers, but that never happens.

494
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,940
So, you know, I'll just leave disappointed.

495
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,780
But no, it was OK.

496
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,540
Like I think they had some pretty good stuff in there.

497
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
Yeah.

498
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,200
I think one thing it did is it set up the holiday pretty well, you know, especially

499
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,020
for things that are outside of the big three, you know, outside of Sony.

500
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,540
And there even was stuff in a little bit from, you know, with Sony and Spider-Man and stuff.

501
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,660
But otherwise, for the most part, you know, the big three kind of do their own things

502
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,340
and what have you, it set up the holiday very well for what you would expect from E3 otherwise.

503
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,380
Because if you think about it, most of what you would see on the show floor at E3, especially

504
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:14,940
the things that were playable, were things that were going to be coming out that holiday.

505
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,500
And there's something to be said about in later years, especially how you would start

506
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,060
seeing later and later things getting announced.

507
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,960
But in the heydays of E3, it was really about what was going to be out that holiday, what

508
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,320
should be out on store shelves.

509
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,220
And I think a lot of the updates and the things that they were showing, it was setting up

510
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,140
the holiday very well for a plethora of third parties and all these...

511
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,380
I don't want to group it together under miscellaneous content because that makes it sound very like

512
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,960
other and unimportant, but that's really, you know, outside the big three, that's really

513
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
what it was.

514
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,700
So I feel like it did a very good job where E3 does not exist anymore of setting up the

515
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,840
holiday for everybody else.

516
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,700
And that's kind of what I got out of Summer Game Fest as a whole.

517
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,620
So could it have been better?

518
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,740
Maybe, but I feel like some of the big publishers want to save some of it for themselves, you

519
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,620
know, and that's just the reality.

520
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:11,500
There's still a lot of different press events that are showcases, people that are coming

521
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
later this month.

522
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,820
So, yeah, a lot of that's going to be kind of held back until those come out.

523
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,820
Yeah.

524
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,820
I would say it's...

525
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,100
I know we're going to talk about it later in the show, but I would say it's a far better

526
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:26,100
miscellaneous event than the PC gaming show, but we'll talk about that later.

527
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,180
Let's go on a heyday.

528
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:34,540
I thought this was another relatively strong announcement, was this morning's Xbox event.

529
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,840
Loki, I'll turn it over to you.

530
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,900
This one I did watch live, but I'm kind of curious on your take and walk us through some

531
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,900
of the things that were announced.

532
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,660
So they had a bunch of different trailers for different things that we were anticipating

533
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,620
trailers being there.

534
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:53,020
So one of those being Fable, they showed off a cinematic trailer that kind of let you know,

535
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,460
hey, we're still working on it.

536
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
And I liked it.

537
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,460
I thought it was funny.

538
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,340
Well, and Richard Ayode being in it is huge.

539
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,540
Yeah, that was fantastic.

540
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,140
Yeah, literally huge.

541
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,500
My one bitch about the Fable thing, though, was that like the gameplay, it was there,

542
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,380
but it was blink an eye and you'll miss it.

543
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,580
I'm pretty sure that whole sequence where the hero, she was running from the giant thing.

544
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,900
I think that was gameplay.

545
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,900
That was it, though.

546
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,300
I still don't have a sense of like, look, we haven't really had a Fable game in a really

547
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,180
long time, and I'm excited for playground games to kind of like get to do their take

548
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,420
on it in the Forza engine and everything.

549
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,780
So I was hoping for a little more about like, what is the game actually going to be type

550
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
of thing.

551
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:48,740
And I just feel like, OK, it's going to have the dry British sense of humor stuff.

552
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
That's fine.

553
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
Which it does.

554
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
It does.

555
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,740
Yeah, it was cute.

556
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
You're not losing that.

557
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,740
It looks like the story will be cute.

558
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:03,500
But I was just hoping for a little more of the game to excite me and keep me going after

559
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,100
years and years of nothing on the Fable front.

560
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,820
That's my only little bitch.

561
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,540
But I, you know, the fact that they have the star power now with Richard Aida and everything

562
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,500
is great.

563
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
So yeah.

564
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Yeah.

565
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,980
And that is unfortunately, a lot of the trailers don't really show much as far as gameplay

566
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
goes.

567
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,980
Let me get some other comments from chat, sorry, over twitch.tv slash vog network.

568
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,180
She Hulk 10 says, well, as far as I'm concerned, this new Fable looked nothing like Fable.

569
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,540
The trailer is just there to say, hey, this game exists.

570
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,940
Trust us.

571
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,540
Starfield saved the show, which we'll talk a little bit about that later.

572
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,660
SG100Matt says, I was meh on a new Fable game, but with playground games doing it, that got

573
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
my interest.

574
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,660
Yeah.

575
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,300
The developers there, the humor is there.

576
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,180
The star power is there.

577
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,740
Is the game there?

578
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,900
I think it's going to be good.

579
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
I hope.

580
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
I hope.

581
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,900
But I, okay.

582
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Okay.

583
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,100
So clearly this is not happening this year.

584
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:04,300
So you're, you're, they need a pass until holiday 2024 yet, but I hope the gameplay

585
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,980
trailer that inevitably comes next year is real good.

586
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,980
Real good.

587
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,100
As far as it looking like Fable, I'm okay.

588
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,580
If they've got a radically different direction, it has been like 10 years and it's a new studio.

589
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,060
So I'm, I'm okay if it, you know, they've kind of turned the car around, so to speak

590
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,660
and gone a different direction with it.

591
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Yeah.

592
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
All right.

593
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,660
Anyway.

594
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
Sorry.

595
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
I have a lot to say on Fable though.

596
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,140
So there was, um, a lot of these member of those games, all the different game studios

597
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,460
that they purchased way back.

598
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,900
It's been a while now.

599
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,220
Um, well now we're starting to see all those games that are in development.

600
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:43,420
So for example, from the devs that did We Happy Few, we had South of Midnight, which

601
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,140
it was kind of a cinematic trailer.

602
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,820
Not really sure what the gameplay is going to be there, but it looks interesting.

603
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,580
Kind of like this whole like Voodoo Bayou type of a vibe to it, which I like.

604
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,700
And then, um, we've got a little peek at Star Wars Outlaws, which is an Ubisoft Star Wars

605
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
game.

606
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,440
And they're going to be showing more of that at the Ubisoft showcase, uh, which is coming

607
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,900
out later this month.

608
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,740
That looked interesting, but again, it was a case of too much trailer and not enough

609
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
game.

610
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,780
But if you're a Star Wars fan, you were horny for it.

611
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
I'm sure you were.

612
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,540
It looked really, really, really good just from like a Star Wars lore perspective.

613
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,660
So yeah, and it's at least, at least it's coupled with this thing is coming in like

614
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
a day or two.

615
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,220
So like Ubisoft's going to show the gameplay.

616
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,180
It's just, we have to wait just a couple more days.

617
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,340
So kind of those two things together, I'm a lot more okay with what they did.

618
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
Yeah.

619
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,580
From, um, the devs of Spiritfarer, we had a game called 33, uh, what was it?

620
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,540
Uh, 33 Immortals, I think.

621
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Yeah.

622
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
Hades inspired games now it looks like.

623
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Yeah.

624
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Yeah.

625
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
Like multiplayer.

626
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,020
It's a 33 player co-op game.

627
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,620
I mean, that sounds cool.

628
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,940
Honestly like Hades 99 or whatever.

629
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,040
I'm here for it.

630
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,420
Like that could be really fun actually.

631
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,220
So um, yeah, neat.

632
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,220
Yeah.

633
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
That looked pretty cool.

634
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,700
Uh, Payday three as announced there is it's coming on game pass as well and it looks like

635
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,700
payday.

636
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,700
So, okay.

637
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Okay.

638
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
Um, can I be honest?

639
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Loki?

640
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,700
Look, I know you like the payday games.

641
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,540
I, I'm not really a fan of the payday game.

642
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
I'm sorry.

643
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,060
I just have to be honest.

644
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:29,620
The parts in game of payday did not look current gen to me and it didn't, it did not look,

645
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,860
it looked very plain.

646
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,500
It just, it is not exciting.

647
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,340
It was not exciting, but maybe these are because I don't get into these kinds of games usually

648
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:45,880
admittedly, but I just, this trailer like made me go this, I'm supposed to get excited

649
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,420
about this cause I, I didn't at all.

650
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,540
Like it just, it was, it was almost kind of bad.

651
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
I'm sorry.

652
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,560
I feel, I always feel bad when I shit on games before I've played them, but like I was not

653
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,820
excited about what I saw at all.

654
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,660
Um, let's see what else.

655
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,940
We had a persona three reloaded.

656
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,220
So our persona three reload, which is going to be coming to game pass as well.

657
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,060
Uh, so that's like pretty neat.

658
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,300
Did you hear about everything persona three doesn't have in it though?

659
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,940
It has like none of the extra content and they replaced all of the voice actors.

660
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,740
All of the voice actors are new.

661
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,180
Well here's the weird thing.

662
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,060
Like for the most part, yes, I would agree, but I feel like the whole thing was done to

663
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,300
get rid of one voice actor in particular whose name is Vic McGoon.

664
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,400
Yeah.

665
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,840
So I have a feeling, unfortunately, contraction on stuff in order to get the association with

666
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,600
that guy gone, they had to replace everybody.

667
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,200
And so it makes that whole thing very complicated.

668
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:53,880
Uh, so yeah, uh, we got the, uh, Skyrim looking game from Obsidian avowed, uh, trailer for

669
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
that.

670
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,880
That looks pretty awesome.

671
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,040
It's, it's going to be, it's going to, you know, scratch my elder scrolls itch until

672
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,400
there's drill six comes out.

673
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,240
Well, I guess Starfield do that too, but here's, here's, here's the thing about avowed and

674
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,940
a lot of games, frankly, that I saw at the Xbox event.

675
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,000
And I find like I'm always walking out of these Xbox events thinking this avowed was

676
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,600
something where I was like, okay, I don't, I'd have to see more on this.

677
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,520
Like in the traditional, how I evaluate game sense, I would usually go, okay, I need to

678
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,880
see more about this.

679
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,560
I need to do is deep dive to know if this is worth spending 70 bucks on.

680
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,280
Like I need to know more about this.

681
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
I see more game play.

682
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,240
I need to get maybe some sense from some critics I trust or some friends, like if this is going

683
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,240
to be worth 70 bucks.

684
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,400
But the thing about the Xbox events, I get to measure it to different criteria because

685
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,320
I go, oh cool, this is on game pass.

686
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,720
This just validates me hanging onto my subscription and yeah, hell yeah, I'm going to download

687
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,600
this day one and check it out.

688
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,720
Like it really changes the criteria of how I approach a lot of games that are shown like,

689
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,200
and again, sorry not to be a bitch, but like payday three didn't even look like it was

690
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,600
worth the bandwidth.

691
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Sorry about it.

692
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,840
But, but you know what?

693
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,160
Maybe it was for somebody else who could give two shits about avowed and that's okay.

694
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,220
That's the beauty about a diverse plate of games that you bring to the table at these

695
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,600
announcement things.

696
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Great.

697
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,260
But avowed, I definitely was like, okay, cool.

698
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
That's going to be on game pass.

699
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,260
Fuck you.

700
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
I'll check it out.

701
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Cool.

702
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,240
And I feel like as long as I'm walking away feeling like that from an Xbox thing, it's

703
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
a win.

704
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
That's true.

705
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Yeah.

706
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Yeah.

707
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,400
I mean, there's like, like you said, there's something for everybody.

708
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:35,160
So for example, people that play payday three may not be fans of, you know, a secret of

709
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,400
monkey Island.

710
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,800
So now we have the sea of thieves teaming up with the secret of monkey Island, do some

711
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,680
sort of a new storyline thing that makes it sound way more interesting than the sea of

712
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
thieves.

713
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
That's for sure.

714
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,080
That's a huge collab.

715
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,240
That's a huge collab.

716
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Is it interesting enough for me to play it?

717
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,360
I don't know, but it looks cool.

718
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,280
I love me some, you know, a secret of monkey Island.

719
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
I was getting pretty excited there.

720
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,320
Then I saw a sea of thieves and I got less excited, but it was still neat to see.

721
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,520
Well, I think again, because this is all game pass, I think one thing that Microsoft slash

722
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,080
rare could do that would be very smart would be to put out some type of campaign or something

723
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:22,680
or an event or do some marketing behind look, if you've missed sea of thieves all this time,

724
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,200
here's how to catch up and feel like you're with it to do this monkey Island stuff like

725
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,200
a little.

726
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,800
And I'm sure they've got to be thinking this in the back of their mind.

727
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,960
Like how do we catch people up who have never played this game, who are suddenly interested

728
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,560
in it because of the Lucas arts collab, I think if they can kind of bring that a little

729
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,560
bit more to the forefront of mind, I think that'll be a win for them.

730
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,480
I think they could win me over if they could convince me that I could catch up relatively

731
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,820
easy and be able to jump into this monkey Island stuff without feeling like I'm seven

732
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,060
years behind on sea of thieves.

733
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,500
Yeah, yeah.

734
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:02,420
Then we got a trailer for what I thought was a flight sim update originally, but then it

735
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,100
ends up being a whole new flight sim game.

736
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,940
So what's going to be unique about flight sim 2024 is now they have a bunch of different

737
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,540
jobs that you can do in the game.

738
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,580
So like if you want to try your hand at you know, aerial firefighting, you can do that

739
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:26,060
or cargo transport or rescue or, you know, all sorts of crazy stuff with that, which

740
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,660
was really cool because kind of taking flight sim in a completely different direction with

741
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
that stuff.

742
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,460
So I'm definitely interested in hearing more about that.

743
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,060
Yeah, I was a little surprised it wasn't an expansion.

744
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,600
I thought that's where it was going at first.

745
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,780
But then of course, again, going back to the game pass thing I just laid out, like does

746
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
it matter?

747
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,060
Because as long as you have game pass, you're going to get it anyway.

748
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,620
And I will say again, flight sim is an excellent example of a game.

749
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,620
I don't think I could justify dropping $70 on it because I'm terrible at flying the planes

750
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,620
and all that.

751
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,980
I need that mode where you start it and it like flies the plane for you and then you

752
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,240
pick it up midway through like that, because you can do that in some of the adventure modes

753
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,280
in the first flight sim.

754
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,820
So you know, I like that, but I don't know if it's worth spending $70 on, but again,

755
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:15,300
with game pass, like that flight sim is probably the, yeah, I'm going to say it's the best

756
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,940
looking video game out there right now, period.

757
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,880
Flight sim is the best looking video game out there right now.

758
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,420
It's just a gorgeous, gorgeous game.

759
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,620
And all this other stuff they're doing with it just, you know, even kicks that up more

760
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,860
where it's like, okay, if just flying a plane is too boring for you, then here's like 20

761
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:37,100
different jobs you could do in the game to give this a little bit more of like something

762
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,220
to get you from A to B, for real.

763
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:48,140
Then we had a trailer for, another trailer for Sasua Saga, Hellblade II, and they said

764
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,940
that it's wrapped up shooting and it's coming out next year.

765
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
So that looks interesting.

766
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,940
It looks good.

767
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Okay.

768
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,100
I'm going to say something unpopular about this game.

769
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,060
It is time for this game to shit or get off the pot.

770
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,080
It is like, I'm sick of the teases for this game.

771
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,700
It has been how many years that they've been teasing this game.

772
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,260
It's and I realize a good game takes time.

773
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:14,500
I get, but we're getting to that like no man's sky pre-hype, what was the other game

774
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:22,300
they drug out for years and years and years, Cyberpunk, that great example, exactly the

775
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,940
worry I'm starting to have for this game.

776
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,800
There is such a thing as too much hype and this game is getting dangerously close.

777
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,340
The most exciting thing about that entire trailer was a release date for next year.

778
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,620
And they, I swear to God, they better not delay it because I cannot take one more year

779
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,180
of this game being teased.

780
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,900
I'm sure it will be great.

781
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,980
Look again, I'm not trying to shit on the game.

782
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,300
I'm just saying how much hype is too much hype.

783
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:54,700
We literally have some groundbreaking new trailer for this game every single year and

784
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,220
I'm ready for something different.

785
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,220
That's all.

786
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,220
Yeah.

787
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:02,260
Oh, Death's Draining would have been another one that did that too.

788
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,380
Oh, good.

789
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,380
Good example.

790
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,380
Yeah.

791
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,740
I mean, and again, none of those games are, well, maybe Cyberpunk, but now it's in a better

792
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,340
state than it was maybe in the beginning.

793
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,380
But you know, Death's Draining wasn't particularly bad.

794
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,340
No man's sky, again, now it's great, you know, the beginning, you know, again, I'm not trying

795
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,940
to crap on the quality of the game.

796
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,600
I'm just saying there is such a thing as too much hype and a point where I'm like, I'm

797
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,240
sick of hearing about it.

798
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,140
And this game is getting there.

799
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,380
It's like on the line.

800
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,860
So let's see.

801
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:42,100
We also had a trailer for Like a Dragon 8 called Infinite Wealth and it was silly.

802
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,340
It's definitely felt like a like a dragon game.

803
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:51,340
It felt like that fucking scene from Austin Powers with all the, yes, that was, that was

804
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,540
objects discreetly covering.

805
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,540
But you know what?

806
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,580
I'm, I'm going to say this, I'm going to say this.

807
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,780
I will give kudos to Sega and Microsoft for daring to show Ichiban's ass.

808
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,780
I will.

809
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
You know what?

810
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,780
I will.

811
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:13,620
Because how many times do we get to see, you know, cleavage, lady, lady butts and all these?

812
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:19,980
I will, I will give props and on Pride Month nonetheless, I will give Microsoft and Sega

813
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,180
their due props for not being afraid to show a butt.

814
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,900
It's just a butt.

815
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,540
Everybody's going to be talking about it for the next week.

816
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,540
But you know what?

817
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:33,500
Y'all, it's, it's, it's, it's just a butt.

818
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,500
Yeah.

819
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,700
We have another update coming to Fallout 76.

820
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,980
They're adding Atlantic City.

821
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,980
Cool.

822
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,100
I'm still not interested in Fallout 76.

823
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:47,100
I hear it is better than it used to be, but too little too late.

824
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,860
Wait, wait, wait.

825
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,460
You went by like a dragon too fast because I just wanted to say this, there's been a

826
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,380
lot of confusion, but this is officially Yakuza 8 basically, which is now like a dragon

827
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,380
is now the main series.

828
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:03,500
This is like a dragon 8 and it is kind of exciting that it is in the, like it's very

829
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:09,500
clearly and literally fish out of water situation, but it sounds like he's going to be in America.

830
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,300
I mean, it looked very Santa Monica to me.

831
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,060
I mean, some people were saying it was Hawaii maybe, but I thought maybe the abundance of

832
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,300
blonde hair, blue eye folks in the scene was supposed to point to like a Santa Monica type

833
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,300
of thing.

834
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:27,540
So, but I like the idea of a Yakuza game taking place in America, or at least in part.

835
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,420
It doesn't mean the whole thing's there because, you know, and like a dragon, you started in

836
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,060
one place, but didn't stay there.

837
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,060
Spoiler alert.

838
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:39,260
But again, if even I know that after all this time, you can have that ruined for you.

839
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,860
It's not, it's just the prologue anyway.

840
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,720
But I think it'll be interesting to see how that goes into America.

841
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:54,800
But yes, I need to see, I need to see that Yakuza like a dragon.

842
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,720
I have, so Orange Right has brought up a clip from the Game Awards 2022 and I have a feeling

844
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,600
I know what I said in this clip.

845
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
I'm sorry.

846
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,400
You guys aren't going to be able to hear this, but I think I know what I said in this clip

847
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,560
and it sounds like, it sounds like again, Rob Stardamus might've come true.

848
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,560
I apologize to my co-host.

849
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,880
You're not going to be able to hear this, but I'm going to play it here on the show

850
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,880
here.

851
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,880
Oops.

852
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:21,880
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
Let me do this.

854
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,240
So this is a clip of Bobby and I doing the Game Awards in 2022.

855
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,000
Thank you Orange Right for digging this up.

856
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,720
I will never understand how these game trailers at these events can slice people in half,

857
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
chop off heads.

858
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,920
Okay.

859
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,760
It's buffering quite a bit, unfortunately.

860
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,400
So let me, I'm going to drop down the quality a little bit just because my poor bandwidth

861
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,720
is probably doing a lot right now.

862
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,440
I will never understand how these game trailers at these events can slice people in half,

863
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,520
chop off heads, but heaven forbid we see a butt.

864
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,680
Heaven forbid we see a butt in a trailer.

865
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,320
So my, my point is to folks planning for the Game Awards 2023 or 2022, excuse me, leading

866
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,800
into 2023, I want to see some butts.

867
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,640
It can happen.

868
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,640
And then you can slice them in half.

869
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,880
That lets you butt first.

870
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,160
Ew.

871
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,280
Wow.

872
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,280
My power.

873
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
TBH.

874
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:27,760
I mean, my ego is already getting pretty big this year, but how about that?

875
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,800
Somebody from Sega was fucking listening to that.

876
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
How about that?

877
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
How about that?

878
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Vognetwork.com.

879
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,440
All right.

880
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,440
Anyway.

881
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,440
All right.

882
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
All right.

883
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:47,560
We had a new game shown from Capcom called Path of the Goddess, which is definitely a

884
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,240
unique looking game.

885
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,240
Let's see what else.

886
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,200
Oh, Forza Motorsports coming out this October.

887
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,640
It's been a while.

888
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,540
Which we kind of knew it was coming, but no.

889
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,600
Another game that they've been hyping a little long, but at least it's this holiday finally.

890
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,240
And I do love Forza Horizon.

891
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:11,960
I wish I was better at the more sim game than the arcade-y game, but I understand there's

892
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,960
a clear difference in the franchise, and this is the one that I enjoy less.

893
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,520
But there are some people that enjoy them far more, and it does look beautiful, I'll

894
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,520
say that.

895
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,520
Again, I know I just said I think Flight Sim is probably the best looking video game out

896
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,640
there, but Forza, not bad.

897
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,880
Not bad by any means.

898
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Looked very good.

899
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,880
Yep.

900
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
What else?

901
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Let's see.

902
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:39,120
The Yellow Scrolls Online, they have a new expansion coming out called Necrom, which

903
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,320
looked interesting.

904
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,000
That's coming out June 20th.

905
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,880
So this was funny.

906
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:53,400
So I guess this is a trailer kind of a walk back a little bit of the whole Overwatch 2

907
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
PvE thing.

908
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,400
Oh, boy, was this a 180.

909
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,840
Holy smokes.

910
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,960
So they had a trailer for that.

911
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,720
That's going to be, I guess, starting, it's coming out in August now.

912
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,080
So that's interesting.

913
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,840
Well, so there's some yes ands with that is that obviously there was this full skill tree

914
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,280
system and all this other stuff that they were talking about with Overwatch 2 originally

915
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,800
that is not going to be there and that this didn't change.

916
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,200
And obviously they couldn't have 180'd on the content that fast, but they clearly 180'd

917
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,200
on the messaging.

918
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,920
This, by the way, is another reason why as much as I don't like big fish eating big fish

919
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,500
in this industry, I absolutely support the Microsoft Activision Blizzard merger is because

920
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:45,560
I feel like Microsoft fixed their fuck up with this and the PvE stuff.

921
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:50,680
I mean, this trailer that they put out was some really good saving face.

922
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:55,240
And a lot of people I know that played Overwatch responded very well to what was in that trailer.

923
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,800
And they did show a variety of content.

924
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,400
Even I was kind of like, oh, all this is going to be in the game?

925
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
Okay.

926
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,680
Like maybe I do need to reinstall it.

927
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,440
Like they even got me.

928
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,040
So kudos to Microsoft for helping them to 180 that messaging real quick.

929
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,240
But I do think, I don't think the PvE is quite as robust as people were going to be hoping

930
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:23,720
for, but it's just nice to see them acknowledge, highlight and show that there is going to

931
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,640
be space for PvE in Overwatch, which was a key component of that trailer.

932
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,400
So yeah, good for them.

933
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,680
Mike Defton chat says they're finally releasing Overwatch 2 and it's just J100Matt says this.

934
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,680
Yeah.

935
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,920
Again, why I think the Microsoft merger is honestly good news.

936
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,360
Also, I just want to backtrack and read a couple of comments on that Capcom title.

937
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,600
Dr. C said, disappointed that it wasn't on Amusha.

938
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,320
It looked like it thematically and quest buster says, I thought so too.

939
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
Yeah.

940
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
Yeah.

941
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
I did kind of look that for a minute.

942
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
So.

943
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Okay.

944
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,800
Persona mastery is coming November 17th.

945
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,680
So got a trailer for that.

946
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:13,520
Lots of like Atlas games being shown for sure because we also got metaphor re Fantasio,

947
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,040
which is a brand new RPG from Atlas as well.

948
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,040
They showed that.

949
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,440
I felt like there were more Japanese developed games in the showcase that we've seen in a

950
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,600
very long time.

951
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,600
Yeah.

952
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:28,080
I noticed that quite a bit without them pointing it out, which is also impressive.

953
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,200
I felt like there was a much more, you know, for all the lol Microsoft in Japan stuff we

954
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,160
usually see there really was a lot of Japanese developed stuff relatively compared to other

955
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,720
Xbox shows in this particular showcase without them pointing it out.

956
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,160
I just thought that was interesting.

957
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,160
Yeah.

958
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:52,120
Then we also got, was it, so they did a trailer for Starfield prior to the Starfield direct,

959
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,240
which was obviously the big main thing at after the event was done.

960
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:05,000
But we got a new trailer for that just sent, which is a new game, I guess, by the life

961
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,040
of strange developers.

962
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:14,920
And it's like a climbing game, which is it was different, but it looked interesting.

963
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,960
Another one, which is also kind of a crazy looking was Still Wakes the Deep, which was

964
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,000
like a horror game almost taking place on it, like an oil rig.

965
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,520
Was that the one from the Chinese room?

966
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,640
Yeah, it is from the Chinese room.

967
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,640
Okay.

968
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,640
Yeah.

969
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,760
I thought the Chinese room like literally like laid off their entire staff like four

970
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,160
or five years ago.

971
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,720
Like how are we getting something new from the Chinese room?

972
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,400
That's and is it, it's not even going to be the same people.

973
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,400
I don't know.

974
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,600
The Chinese room made one of my very favorite narrative games ever, which is Everybody's

975
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,640
Gone to the Rapture.

976
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,440
And that's why when I see their logo, I fucking pay attention.

977
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,520
But there's a part of me that's like, well, is it going to be like that?

978
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,440
Because like, usually that logo enough would sell me on a game knowing it was the same

979
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
creative team.

980
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,560
But it's like, what maybe the studio head is the same and that's it.

981
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,200
So I don't know how to feel about it.

982
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,480
I need to see a little more to see if it's a narrative heavy game or what.

983
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,800
Oh, and the music, wasn't it?

984
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,120
I could be wrong, but I want to say it was the studio head's wife that did the music

985
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,120
for that game.

986
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,240
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

987
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:27,160
So if, if that's the case for this game, like again, the music would be awesome.

988
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:32,040
So yeah, just as Joe 100 Matt says 2017, they laid off their staff.

989
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,360
That's what I thought because I was I remember thinking at the time, Oh, bummer.

990
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,640
I really liked that game.

991
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,320
And now we're not going to get anything else from them.

992
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,400
And whoops, here we are.

993
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,880
So interesting.

994
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,880
Yeah.

995
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,000
Um, Dungeons of Hinterberg, which was kind of an adventure games.

996
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,920
They did like a cel shaded sword fighting adventure game.

997
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,080
They have like a hoverboard type thing in there, which looked kind of cool.

998
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:00,120
I'm down for more like adventure games.

999
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:06,600
There was a big deal with Kiana Reeves coming out to talk about the Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom

1000
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:14,680
Liberty trailer, which it's content coming out in September.

1001
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,920
And of course, it also has Idris Elba in it.

1002
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,520
And I guess you're saving the future president of something, the United States, maybe.

1003
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,520
So that'll be pretty cool looking.

1004
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,520
What else?

1005
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,680
Let's see, Tower Born, which was a game by the creators of the Banner Saga look pretty

1006
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
cool.

1007
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,760
I really liked that big tower with the windmill thing on top of it.

1008
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,080
That looked really cool, kind of stylized.

1009
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,840
And then of course, the one they ended with reminded me the most of Bioshock Infinite,

1010
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,720
but Clockwork Revolution.

1011
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,440
It's a time bending steampunk RPG that certainly feels like Bioshock Infinite.

1012
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,040
Yeah, I thought it was a Bioshock announcement at first too, but then I was like, this isn't

1013
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,560
really like stylistic.

1014
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,880
It looks like Infinite, but it doesn't look like it at all.

1015
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,720
It's the developers that did Wasteland and Arcanium.

1016
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,640
So it's, I mean, I'm down for it.

1017
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,120
It looks cool.

1018
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:18,060
And then they announced one terabyte black Xbox Series S is coming for $349 in case you

1019
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:25,680
wanted an S, but you wanted more space to fit, you know, a few copies of Flight Sim

1020
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,680
or something like that.

1021
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
Yeah.

1022
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,440
I want to correct myself minorly on one thing I brought up earlier.

1023
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,120
So I was talking about Jessica Curry is her name, and she was the composer of Everybody's

1024
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,200
Gone to the Rapture.

1025
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:42,120
And yes, she was the wife of Dan Pinchbeck, who was part of Dear Esther.

1026
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,200
He made that game.

1027
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,880
And then they went on to form, I guess, the Chinese Room at that point.

1028
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,000
But it's also important to point out she wasn't just a composer of Everybody's Gone to the

1029
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Rapture.

1030
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
She was the director.

1031
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
That's an important clarification.

1032
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,120
So she had a much bigger hand in that game than just the music.

1033
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:03,400
And though nothing about what's happening with her current status with the Chinese Room,

1034
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,320
because I believe, I'm sorry, I'm trying to do some research live as we're looking at

1035
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,320
this.

1036
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,760
It does appear that Pinchbeck still is a creative director for the Chinese Room.

1037
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,320
And Curry is an independent composer for the studio.

1038
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,400
So maybe she will be doing the music.

1039
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,400
Who knows?

1040
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,400
Could be very interesting.

1041
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,880
All right, anyway, more to come on that.

1042
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,880
Yeah.

1043
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,920
Starfield looks amazing.

1044
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,160
I hope it doesn't.

1045
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,160
Please don't suck.

1046
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,800
I mean, it looks amazing, but please don't suck.

1047
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,320
It's based off of all the stuff that they talked about.

1048
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,460
So thousands of different planets you can go on.

1049
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,040
It's basically like a no man's sky.

1050
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:54,000
You can create your own ships, you can have crew on your ships, you can actually go inside.

1051
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,040
I think that's a little bit different than no man's sky.

1052
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,720
No, you know what it sounded like to me?

1053
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,360
The original vision for Mass Effect Andromeda is what it sounded like to me.

1054
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,360
Remember?

1055
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,360
Because Andromeda was supposed to be like lots more planets that were supposed to have

1056
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,560
more generated stuff with RPG elements.

1057
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,500
And then they kind of had the Frostbite engine wouldn't let them do it basically.

1058
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,040
So they had to change it into what it was, which they got some flack for doing.

1059
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,660
So yeah, definitely in hearing about that, I was like, this is basically what Andromeda

1060
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,380
was supposed to be.

1061
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,640
This is very interesting to me.

1062
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,880
I will say, I turned off the Starfield Direct halfway through, but not for the reason you

1063
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,880
think.

1064
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,200
I turned it off halfway through because I was convinced.

1065
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,220
I was like, all right, and you all know, I don't like to overhype things.

1066
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,240
And so halfway through, I was like, all right, I'm convinced.

1067
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,400
It's on Game Pass anyway.

1068
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
I'm downloading it.

1069
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,400
I'll check it out.

1070
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,140
I don't need to hear every nook and cranny about the game, you know, and why this city

1071
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,560
is beautiful.

1072
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,480
And they put 5,000 side quests in there and this is so expansive.

1073
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,760
At that point, I was like, all right, I've heard enough.

1074
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,760
I'm fine.

1075
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Like, stop.

1076
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,760
I'm buying.

1077
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,760
It's fine.

1078
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,760
You're good.

1079
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,760
So that's why I turned it off.

1080
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,800
I just was like, hype train has pulled into the station.

1081
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,880
We're good.

1082
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,120
So I'll be checking that out for sure when it releases.

1083
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,120
I'm not going to splurge the money for the five day early release because, you know,

1084
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,280
they're trying to do extra things to lure you in addition to Game Pass and that stuff.

1085
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,040
But nah, the Game Pass one is fine for me.

1086
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,280
If I find it's worth spending extra money on, I'll do it outside of the game.

1087
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,320
So yeah.

1088
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,200
Questbuster in chat says, Starfield looks good, but I also zoned out in the middle of

1089
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,800
the presentation because I already got what I wanted to.

1090
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,800
I'm fine.

1091
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,800
Thanks.

1092
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,800
No, I don't need a membership card.

1093
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,880
Yeah, exactly that.

1094
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,600
As Jonathan and Matt says, you don't need to sell me on the timeshare.

1095
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
I'm buying.

1096
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
Yep.

1097
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf.

1098
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
Great point.

1099
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,860
You'll be at Dragon Con during the early release days.

1100
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,400
That's right, because it releases on September 6.

1101
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,560
And this game is literally Club 96 because it's releasing on September 6.

1102
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,560
So exactly.

1103
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Yeah.

1104
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,560
I'll be at Dragon Con for early access anyway.

1105
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,480
That's what I have to worry about with this.

1106
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:01,960
So like a game like Skyrim, you can play for like thousands of hours and that's one world.

1107
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,200
Is this just going to be the game that I end up having to play the rest of my life?

1108
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,600
I wonder if the, I wonder if the planets are a little more confined.

1109
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,240
Like there's artificial ways they wall them in or something that they didn't really show.

1110
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,520
Like mountains you can't scale or something like the, you know, you, you just never have

1111
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,520
the right equipment to do.

1112
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,520
I don't know.

1113
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,920
Again, I'm, you know, maybe I'm saying too much or whatever, but it just seems like maybe

1114
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,920
there's some ways.

1115
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,680
Or yeah, if they're just using AI to randomly generate shit all the way to, or machine learning,

1116
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,640
whatever you want to call it, between things, then okay, so it's a bunch of nothing between

1117
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,720
all these areas, which could end up being its own problem too.

1118
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:47,880
But I, I think it'll be good enough and vast and exploring enough.

1119
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,800
And do you want to play it the rest of your life?

1120
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Maybe.

1121
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,800
Okay.

1122
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Yeah.

1123
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,560
Bobby Blackwell says it is procedurally generated with handcrafted elements.

1124
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,200
So interesting.

1125
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,800
I mean, it looks, looks interesting.

1126
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,840
I definitely want to check it out.

1127
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,620
I mean, yeah.

1128
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,620
Bring it on.

1129
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,620
I'm excited.

1130
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,680
Again, this is one of the things where it's because it's game pass, it's like, okay, yeah,

1131
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,400
I'll keep my game pass subscription active and I will download this on September 6th.

1132
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,400
Done.

1133
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,400
We're good.

1134
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,940
I don't need to hear anymore.

1135
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,840
So character creator looked really good too.

1136
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,840
Yes.

1137
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,920
Very like tons of things you can do with that.

1138
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,880
Although our old pal Travis Donovan from a show called Understation Live that was here

1139
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,520
on VOG for quite some time before it sunsetted, he made a very good point.

1140
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,400
He said with everything going on, and I'm paraphrasing his tweets, I don't have it in

1141
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:37,740
front of me, but he was like, with everything going on, you know, in video games and technology

1142
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:43,100
these days, it is so wild that I can't just take a selfie and upload it into the character

1143
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:47,520
creator and have it generate something that's basically close enough.

1144
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,180
They have that in some games.

1145
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,180
It's just not this one.

1146
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,620
The Nintendo me thing did that if I remember right.

1147
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:55,020
Do you think you could do that with your 3DS?

1148
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,020
Couldn't you?

1149
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,380
Well, yeah, yeah, you could, but like NBA 2K, I think does that.

1150
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,860
Oh yeah, it does.

1151
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,460
I know NBA 2K does that.

1152
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,460
There's other games that also have those where you can map things because people put their

1153
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,600
babies and dogs and all sorts of weird stuff.

1154
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,660
But yeah, this, the only thing that I saw that's kind of catering to you is that they

1155
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,780
said that the robot will say your name like they did in Fallout 4.

1156
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,780
So cool.

1157
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,500
I mean, I don't know.

1158
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,180
I don't really need it to, you know, exactly look like me.

1159
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,220
Well, Rob isn't exactly a hard name either, so maybe I need to give myself a more clever

1160
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,220
name.

1161
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,940
I'll name myself after one of the animals like I often do in video games.

1162
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,020
So I'll go by Mr. Smoosh.

1163
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:40,740
So the robot has to call me that or like Nostradamus or something.

1164
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,740
See?

1165
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:42,740
Yeah.

1166
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,380
All right.

1167
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,740
Anything else on the Xbox event?

1168
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:52,540
No, I mean, that was pretty much the major announcements that they had.

1169
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:53,540
How'd you feel?

1170
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,260
I liked the Starfield controller.

1171
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,900
I thought that looked pretty cool.

1172
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,900
I did.

1173
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,620
I liked that too, actually.

1174
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,620
Yeah.

1175
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,740
And they had headphones too.

1176
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,260
I didn't really get a good look at the headphones.

1177
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,580
The collector's edition watch.

1178
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,580
That's neat.

1179
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,820
Not going to buy it, but that's neat.

1180
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:13,460
I mean, that they have a watch.

1181
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:18,020
It would have been cooler if it like tied in with the game, like using like a cell phone

1182
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:19,020
or something like that.

1183
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:22,420
Although it says you can read your notifications and stuff on your cell phone on the watch,

1184
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,620
which is neat.

1185
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:28,420
But yeah, if it like tied into the game or something like that, it would be pretty cool.

1186
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,420
Neat.

1187
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,420
All right.

1188
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,900
Overall, you feel pretty good about that?

1189
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,900
Yeah, it was positive.

1190
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:34,900
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good.

1191
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:41,860
I mean, I think the best way, like, what was it, like to quote Skill Up, they said, you

1192
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:47,260
know, I judge a presentation like that based off of how many games I'm excited to play.

1193
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:50,800
And I think that this had a lot of games I'm excited to play in it.

1194
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,980
So I would say it's pretty positive in my opinion.

1195
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,980
Yeah.

1196
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:02,580
I think Game Pass changes the way you evaluate a lot of stuff in that showcase.

1197
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:08,220
And again, as has been the case for several years now, these showcases are wonderful advertisements

1198
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,220
for Game Pass.

1199
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,380
And I feel that that was pretty much the same theme this year.

1200
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,460
All right.

1201
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,880
Well, let's move on.

1202
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,220
And you know, an hour into the show, let's finally talk about our gaming weeks.

1203
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,940
Hey, we knew it would be that kind of week this week, though, with all the announcements.

1204
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,620
Let's talk about the types of games we have been playing this week, though, while we anticipate

1205
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,220
all this other upcoming stuff.

1206
01:02:28,220 --> 01:02:31,940
I need to step away real quick, but I'll start by throwing it to Jamie and ask, how was your

1207
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,820
gaming week?

1208
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,500
It was all right.

1209
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,220
I played Black Knight 2000.

1210
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,860
I'm sorry, Black Knight Sword of Rage, which we have now, and it's really awesome.

1211
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:52,900
And I played some Turtles and I played some World Cup Soccer for my pinball gaming.

1212
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,980
And then, of course, I played Dead by Daylight.

1213
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:08,860
I've also played Marvel's Midnight Suns, I've played Cult of the Lamb, and I'm actually

1214
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:10,020
branching out.

1215
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:14,020
I'm trying to look at a couple other things that I just want to play in my downtime.

1216
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:17,420
So kind of thinking about starting something new.

1217
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,420
We'll see.

1218
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,420
That's it.

1219
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,420
OK.

1220
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,820
I played Minecraft.

1221
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,220
Surprise.

1222
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,100
It's the same thing.

1223
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,940
Don't play in stuff.

1224
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:34,620
I've designed two of the Robot Master areas because I'm going to try to cram two in one

1225
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,940
episode, which is ridiculous, but I've got them designed.

1226
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,820
I've got one I've already started building.

1227
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:44,860
The other one will probably finish later this week.

1228
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,980
I'm hoping to get an episode out in the middle of the week because this is the pace I have

1229
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:54,940
to keep in order to finish on time, to finish everything I wanted, because originally the

1230
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:59,620
season we were planning on going to the end of the year, but then we decided to change

1231
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,860
that now so it's not the whole year.

1232
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:07,860
And so because I could have scaled down the scope of my projects, but instead I decided

1233
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:11,860
to double up on how quickly I get them done.

1234
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:18,900
So that's not entirely healthy, but it is what I'm doing and it is coming along.

1235
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,180
It is pretty fun.

1236
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:26,340
So lots of stuff very soon.

1237
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:27,340
Lots of builds.

1238
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,340
Very, very cool.

1239
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,860
I've been checking in from time to time.

1240
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,860
Thank you.

1241
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,860
Appreciate it.

1242
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,860
And I can tell you that Dan followed you too.

1243
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,820
Oh, thank you.

1244
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,820
All right.

1245
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:48,940
Well, then I can hop into my gaming week, which was primarily Diablo 4 because I was

1246
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,220
talking about it a little bit last week.

1247
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,660
I know, shock and awe.

1248
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,220
But I've been feeling a lot better this week.

1249
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,780
I was sick last weekend.

1250
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:00,540
If you listen to last week's show, I've been feeling a lot better as the days have gone

1251
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,540
by.

1252
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,700
I still have a little bit of residual, but for the most part now it's Alan.

1253
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,940
Alan finally got sick.

1254
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,340
He finally caught whatever I had like on Wednesday.

1255
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:14,280
I think what ultimately happened, I had strep throat and a sinus cold at the same time.

1256
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,380
Like legitimately that's what happened because Alan only caught the sinus cold part.

1257
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,240
He didn't catch the strep throat.

1258
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,740
So interesting.

1259
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,180
Well, strep is bacterial.

1260
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,180
Yeah.

1261
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:27,460
So he would have had, I guess.

1262
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:31,500
But we knew at a certain point like not to touch each other and sleep in different beds.

1263
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:36,100
So like we kind of knew early on said strep, but I think the sinus thing was harder to

1264
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,100
prevent for whatever reason.

1265
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,300
It doesn't necessarily help with bacteria.

1266
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,980
That's more of a viral precaution, but yeah.

1267
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,380
You know, you do what you can.

1268
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:44,380
All right.

1269
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,980
But anyway, point is I'm feeling a lot better and I was able to really put some hours into

1270
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,020
Diablo 4 this week and I beat the main campaign.

1271
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,020
Yay.

1272
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,220
Um, and uh, I'm in the end game stuff now.

1273
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,500
I'm only level 50.

1274
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,940
I kind of timed it really good.

1275
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,300
I beat the game around level 48 so I've been doing end game stuff up to level 50 and I

1276
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,900
just before tonight's show, I beat the capstone dungeon to get me into world tier three where

1277
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,300
some more stuff unlocks.

1278
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,100
Um, so that's pretty cool.

1279
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:14,260
I will say as far as the game itself goes in the story, I was, it's, it's great.

1280
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,820
Like and you know, I know I've been hyping this game up a lot, but like the story was

1281
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:19,660
really well done.

1282
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:20,900
It has its faults.

1283
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:23,940
There were a couple things about the end of the game that really annoyed the piss out

1284
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:24,940
of me.

1285
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,940
Like narrative wise.

1286
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:31,160
Um, I kind of think one of the, all right, I'm gonna watch my words carefully.

1287
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:35,560
Not everybody's beaten it yet, so I'm going to just, I'm going to hold my criticisms out

1288
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,680
of respect for those that are still working their way through.

1289
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,040
But in six weeks when season one starts, I'm not going to promise the same was straight.

1290
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,040
So all of you into Diablo better hurry up.

1291
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:49,240
Um, but um, I will say those complaints are relatively minor.

1292
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:55,280
I do think the good news about the game and the story wise is that Lilith was an incredible

1293
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:01,600
antagonist and I'm really pleased that they juggled new characters, obviously cause at

1294
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,400
the time, you know, this is past, well past Diablo three, they had to incorporate a lot

1295
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,500
of new characters with some of the classics.

1296
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:14,960
But like Diablo himself is not really a main character in this game at all.

1297
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:23,000
He's there, he's mentioned, he relates to Lilith, um, because you know, basically Diablo

1298
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
is Lilith's uncle.

1299
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
That's not a spoiler.

1300
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,120
If you, if you read up on the game, you kind of know how Lilith relates to everything in

1301
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,960
Diablo lore and so forth.

1302
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:37,680
But, but it is very clear Diablo will play into an expansion and it is very clear there

1303
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:44,000
will be story expansions and it, because to me they very clearly teased a new class in

1304
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
the game.

1305
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,520
Like there are NPC, major NPCs that are, I think a class that was in Diablo three that

1306
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,960
is not Diablo four, uh, which will be very exciting when that shows up.

1307
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,600
Uh, and uh, yeah, just left it very open ended, but I'm, I'm okay.

1308
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:04,680
I mean, like again, I thought the six acts that they gave you were really well done story

1309
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,640
and uh, very, uh, yeah, very comprehensive.

1310
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,680
Uh, Questbuster says, I only just started the story a day or two in Diablo four.

1311
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,220
I spent most of my time just exploring and building my sorceress.

1312
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,640
The world is so huge.

1313
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,720
I, yeah, I mean, that's how I started too, but let me give you a friendly piece of advice.

1314
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,600
Don't overdo it with staying in one zone.

1315
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,240
It can be a dragon age origins, hinterlands kind of thing.

1316
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:34,960
You really need to force yourself to leave the zone once you unlock that second skill

1317
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:35,960
point.

1318
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,600
And my reason for that is the other stuff you unlock by doing more things in the zone

1319
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,740
are gated behind world tier three.

1320
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:48,440
So you're working like the more, the Paragon points and the obols, you can't get those

1321
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,960
until you're in world tier three, which you can't do until you beat the game.

1322
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,520
So look, I'm all for side questing and I'm not going to tell you not to side quest.

1323
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:01,360
That would be foolish, but I will say you're, you're, you're going to be working towards

1324
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:06,640
things you can't even unlock once you get that second skill point in an area.

1325
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,200
So you get skill point potion upgrade, which is very helpful too.

1326
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,160
And then another skill point, once you unlock that second skill point, force yourself to

1327
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
move on.

1328
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,660
You'll be doing yourself a favor.

1329
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:20,860
Once you get through the main story, you get a mount towards the end of the story, which

1330
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,960
helps greatly with the exploration.

1331
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,460
You'll be thanking yourself.

1332
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,620
So yeah, I know, I know it goes against everything I want to do in a game normally too, but you

1333
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:30,740
really have to force yourself to move on.

1334
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,340
So all right.

1335
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:36,100
Questmaster says you can get Paragon points.

1336
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,820
They just take a super long time because I'm still on tier two.

1337
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:44,400
Yes, but you can actually get a four Paragon point bonus for getting a certain reputation

1338
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,400
in the zone.

1339
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,480
That's very high, but only on world tier three.

1340
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:54,680
So all right, Pop Culture says I'm playing on Black Wolf mode and I'm still struggling.

1341
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,360
Make sure you are evaluating your gear.

1342
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,100
Don't be afraid to do some upgrades, especially on your weapon.

1343
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:06,600
And remember death really doesn't have a penalty outside of durability, which is a nothing

1344
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,600
factor anyway.

1345
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,020
You get the gold to make up for that by killing one pack of mobs.

1346
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:13,440
So take it at your own pace.

1347
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,440
It's fine.

1348
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,840
I beat the game on world tier one.

1349
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,440
I didn't move to world tier two until I beat the game.

1350
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,380
So you are, and I got to like 48 with all the side quests I did.

1351
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:27,980
So don't feel like you're going to get a subpar experience just because you're not able to

1352
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,260
go past world tier one for whatever reason.

1353
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,280
So but yeah, Diablo four, I think it's great.

1354
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,560
I can't wait to experience more of the end game and playing with friends too, because

1355
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,780
I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, all right, I'm sick of doing all these dungeons

1356
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,780
by myself.

1357
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:44,300
I want to do team up and do some of this harder stuff would be a little more fun.

1358
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,820
So hoping to do some of that in the next week.

1359
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,820
All right.

1360
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,820
That was my gaming week.

1361
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:52,620
I mean, I played a little 14, a little dead by daylight, but let's be real.

1362
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,100
Most of it was Diablo four.

1363
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,140
All right.

1364
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:59,860
Let's go on to some more gaming news, more expos.

1365
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:03,420
But this, you know what, Loki, I felt like, I felt like this one didn't, this one didn't

1366
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,500
deserve a headline spot tonight.

1367
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,100
Well, it's, it's, it's, it never does.

1368
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:13,420
It's the PC gaming show and it's usually pretty lame as it is.

1369
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:18,700
But they tried to go the whole, and this is where like I fault them, especially because

1370
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:24,100
they tried to go the Devolver digital route and they failed horribly at it.

1371
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:26,820
Like it was just cringy.

1372
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:29,500
The hosts were very cringy.

1373
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,500
Please don't do that.

1374
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,500
Just show the trailers.

1375
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,500
That's all you got to do.

1376
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,060
You don't even have to have the hosts.

1377
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,980
They don't serve any purpose other than wasting everybody's time.

1378
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,940
But there's lots of different things that they did show.

1379
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:46,420
I'm going to try to go down through some of these that I recognize that look pretty cool.

1380
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:50,840
So let's see, and this is based off of like when it's actually going to be released here.

1381
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:56,120
So we had a vampire survivors update 1.5 is coming out actually tomorrow.

1382
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,180
So that looked pretty cool.

1383
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,500
Teardown is getting a creative mode, which teardown, if you're not familiar, is that

1384
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,460
voxel kind of heist game, but now you can build with voxels and stuff and do crazy things

1385
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:08,460
with them.

1386
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,780
So that looked pretty cool.

1387
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,700
A game called Miasma Chronicles.

1388
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,180
That's going to be coming out on the 20th and it looked pretty sweet.

1389
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:22,220
Parked Beyond, that Bandai Namco game, it's a park sim that's going to be coming out here

1390
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:23,220
this week.

1391
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,900
What other cool things, 3DXX.

1392
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,900
I get it.

1393
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:32,760
3DXX is supposed to be kind of like a Mega Man game, but those those main characters

1394
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,500
are like goddamn like wish.com Mega Man.

1395
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,980
I mean, like it's it's a little too close for my comfort, to be honest.

1396
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:40,980
I didn't.

1397
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,920
Is this a sequel to 20 XCX?

1398
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:43,920
I think it is.

1399
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,920
Yes.

1400
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,640
So that's coming out in August 9th.

1401
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,700
Path of Exile 2, the showcase July 28th for that.

1402
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:59,940
There's a lot of what was the other one here that in vector rhythm galaxy, I think would

1403
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,840
be one you want to check out a new rhythm game that's coming out July 14th.

1404
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,600
That's the Avicii one.

1405
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
But now with.

1406
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,600
Yes.

1407
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Yeah.

1408
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:13,380
With just a rotation of electro songs at this point.

1409
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:14,380
Yeah.

1410
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,380
Yeah.

1411
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:16,380
That Avicii game was pretty good, actually.

1412
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,380
It was a good tribute.

1413
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,380
Yeah.

1414
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:23,820
We had a Frostpunk 2 announced, so it's coming out next year.

1415
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,660
Parcel Court looked pretty sweet.

1416
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:30,300
It's a you're a bike courier and it's like lots of like jumping off walls and stuff like

1417
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,300
that, which is cool.

1418
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:39,880
Mullet Magic, which is a 90s anime like roguelike game that's kind of a one of those retro FPS

1419
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,280
games done like the style of Duke Nukem or something like that, that's going to be coming

1420
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:46,280
out at some point.

1421
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,680
It looked pretty sweet.

1422
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:53,940
XO one, the developers that made that kind of I don't know what you kind of call it.

1423
01:13:53,940 --> 01:14:00,400
It's more of like a planetary exploration, kind of like a it's not an action game, but

1424
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,460
it's like a you traverse like different planet landscapes and now they have XO Rally Championship

1425
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:09,380
where you're in this kind of buggy that you have to control kind of through those same

1426
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:12,200
type of landscapes, but looks a little bit more challenging.

1427
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,980
So that's something that got announced as well.

1428
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:23,920
There was one that I saw that looked just like Animal Crossing Critter Cove was an Animal

1429
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,860
Crossing type game that's going to be coming out here at some point.

1430
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,900
Mariachi Legends looked pretty sweet.

1431
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:38,600
It's kind of a almost like Spanish mythos like Metroidvania type game.

1432
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,540
So that looked pretty cool.

1433
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:48,980
Stampede Racing Royale is the horrible amalgamation of a battle royale game and Mario Kart, and

1434
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:53,600
it looked like too many players on like a track at the same time, but it's your usual

1435
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,920
like kart game.

1436
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,000
The Invincible looked pretty cool.

1437
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,060
I'm trying to see what else.

1438
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,060
Lords of the Fallen, I think, is being remade.

1439
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:07,980
Oh, yeah, somebody somebody showed me a clip of that.

1440
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:08,980
Yeah, they are.

1441
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:14,900
It's like a it's not really a remake, but it's like a re reinterpretation or something.

1442
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:15,900
Yeah, I guess.

1443
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,820
Yeah, I don't even know if I called it that, but yeah.

1444
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:24,620
Sand, which is a kind of like a steampunk game set in deserts, looked pretty cool.

1445
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:30,160
They they they teased it before the like event, they're like, the full trailer is coming during

1446
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,160
this.

1447
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:37,320
They kept it to the end and the trailer was just like 30 seconds of like a cinematic.

1448
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:43,240
It showed nothing of what the game is about, and it's it just sucked the whole the whole

1449
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:44,240
thing sucks.

1450
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,240
Okay.

1451
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,240
Like the games are cool.

1452
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,240
Yeah.

1453
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:48,240
That's like some games.

1454
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:49,240
Yeah, the games are awesome.

1455
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:54,340
But like, oh, another one, Dwarf is another game that they showed that reminded me of

1456
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:58,080
old school Command and Conquer, which I am totally down for.

1457
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,280
So that looked cool.

1458
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:05,800
And then the most random thing ever, another Castlevania or Metroidvania style game starring

1459
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:09,720
Ebenezer Scrooge and Ebenezer and the Invisible World.

1460
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,120
Okay, sure.

1461
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,560
This is what happens when classics go into the public domain.

1462
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,560
Sure.

1463
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,560
Why not?

1464
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,920
I mean, every let everybody have a Metroidvania game.

1465
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:21,920
That's fine.

1466
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:22,920
Yeah.

1467
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,920
But yeah, lots.

1468
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:28,540
You know what, though, I it's it's quirky enough to sound actually kind of interesting,

1469
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,540
to be honest.

1470
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:30,740
Yeah, it's all right.

1471
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:35,620
They showed off a lot of different trailers for like, Hello Neighbor, there's so many

1472
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:39,420
Hello Neighbors spin offs now, like I can't keep track of all of them.

1473
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:41,900
I know one of them was like Hello Engineer.

1474
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:46,620
And then they have like, I don't even know they have like several Hello Neighbor games.

1475
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:51,500
Oh, and then another one that I remembered was My Friendly Neighborhood, which is, you

1476
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,400
know, you've got your FNAF, which is a take on, you know, of course, Chuck E. Cheese and

1477
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,880
stuff like that, you know, Showtime Pizza.

1478
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:03,540
Well, now you have your, well, let's make a FNAF type game, but it's with Sesame Street.

1479
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:06,060
And so that's what My Friendly Neighborhood is.

1480
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,280
You're fighting off Muppets.

1481
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,280
Oh, no.

1482
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,600
Are Bert and Ernie in it?

1483
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:17,720
Uh, they're, you know, legally distinct Bert and Ernie are in it.

1484
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,720
Okay, okay.

1485
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,180
Kurt and Mernie.

1486
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,060
Kurt and, yeah.

1487
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,440
All right.

1488
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,020
So it sounds like the PC gaming show just maybe needs to reevaluate the presentation

1489
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,560
because the game trailers themselves are fine.

1490
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,340
It's just the presentation of it all is like, they need to do better.

1491
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:44,200
I noticed they were partnering with Heka streamers, trying to get the streamers to like co-stream

1492
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:48,920
and kind of build the hype that way because I have some influencer friends and like all

1493
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,640
of them were mysteriously hyping up the PC gaming show.

1494
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,440
And I was like, y'all don't usually get excited about this kind of stuff.

1495
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,240
Like I know what's going on.

1496
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,700
Yeah, it's just, it was just cringe.

1497
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,020
Like the presenters were cringe, the trailers were good.

1498
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,580
The presenters were cringe.

1499
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,580
Just tone it down.

1500
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:12,640
Like you're not going to be as funny as Devolver Digital.

1501
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:14,640
Get that out of your head.

1502
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,920
You're just not going to, it's not going to happen.

1503
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:17,920
All right.

1504
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,680
We'll talk about Devolver Digital a little later in the show, but first we have some

1505
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,720
more stories that don't involve showcases that are going on this week, but we have this

1506
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:27,720
to talk about.

1507
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,720
Oh boy.

1508
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,720
All right.

1509
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,400
Get your popcorn because I got something to say about this.

1510
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,780
So Activision has removed a Call of Duty skin from sale.

1511
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,640
This skin was for a streamer community.

1512
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,720
The streamer's name is Nickmercs.

1513
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:49,440
I had not heard of this guy until this story came out, although apparently I'd already

1514
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,520
blocked him on Twitter at some point, so this is clearly not the first thing he's done that

1515
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,420
made me make a face.

1516
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:57,680
What is it that he did?

1517
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:04,640
He made a comment on social media in response to a video that was shared by an esports caster,

1518
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,760
Chris Puckett, and they were in the video.

1519
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:13,880
Some pro-LGBTQIA plus demonstrators were being attacked outside of a school in California,

1520
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:18,280
and in the caption, Chris Puckett said, Americans are in a sad place right now.

1521
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:21,320
Let people love who they love and live your own life.

1522
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:26,120
I'm sorry, I'm getting angry just even having to read this.

1523
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:31,320
In a reply, Nickmercs said, they should leave little children alone.

1524
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,560
That's the real issue.

1525
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:41,640
And, of course, people went off on Twitter, as you might expect.

1526
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:47,060
Even the esports caster that wrote the original tweet put, who is they and what terrible act

1527
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,520
is everyone afraid of?

1528
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:53,960
I think, Hope, the goal of most of them is to reduce child suicides.

1529
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:58,640
This is done through acceptance and removing the stigma of feeling being different.

1530
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,360
As a dad, I'm struggling to see the harm.

1531
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,000
Gay doesn't equal pedo.

1532
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,420
Great response by Chris Puckett.

1533
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,420
Thank you very much.

1534
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,520
You do not make me angry.

1535
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:16,920
Then Nickmercs goes on to stream and doesn't apologize for the tweet, but also denies having

1536
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:20,920
anti-LGBT beliefs.

1537
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,880
I'm not going to play the clip because I'm not going to amplify this guy's views, because

1538
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:30,820
as far as I'm concerned, that little fucky comment stands for itself.

1539
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:33,540
Not during Pride Month, you son of a bitch.

1540
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,020
You are not going to make these types of fucking comments during Pride Month.

1541
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:44,220
Thank God you lost your sponsorship, because some people don't deserve to be famous.

1542
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,500
The Kardashians deserve more fame than you do after a comment like that.

1543
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:57,940
During Pride Month, I am sick and fucking tired of this gay equals pedophilia connotation.

1544
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:02,060
I'll tell you who's molesting kids, and it's not drag queens.

1545
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,540
You can finish the rest of that sentence.

1546
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:07,200
You want to go look on social media and the facts for yourself.

1547
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,040
It's not drag queens doing it.

1548
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,500
You can figure out the other half of that.

1549
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,540
I don't need to spell it out for you.

1550
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:14,540
But I'm-

1551
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:18,600
Yeah, they have that whole subreddit called Not a Drag Queen that-

1552
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,260
I am sick and tired of this.

1553
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:29,500
Alan, my husband and I just want to live our fucking lives with our cats and go to Target.

1554
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,900
That is all we want.

1555
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:39,020
Not any of this shit about they should leave little children alone.

1556
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:42,720
Spoiler alert, I don't even really like kids.

1557
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,820
We don't plan on having our own.

1558
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:51,820
Now before my friends with children get offended, obviously, I like my friends' kids in small

1559
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:52,860
doses.

1560
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,260
Loki, your children are fine.

1561
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,420
But you know what the great thing about your kids-

1562
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,420
It's fine.

1563
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,180
I like my kids in small doses too.

1564
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,180
That's everybody's kids.

1565
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,180
Here's the great thing-

1566
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:06,060
It was like I would say when I was babysitting Julian, I can give him back what I've done.

1567
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,060
That is it.

1568
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,060
That is it.

1569
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:09,060
That is the lovely thing.

1570
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,060
That is it.

1571
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:15,740
At some point there comes a day with, okay, this visit was lovely and now I'm going to

1572
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,740
leave.

1573
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:17,740
La la la la la.

1574
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,740
That is the best part.

1575
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:19,740
That's the best part.

1576
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:24,700
Now you get to take them.

1577
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:30,980
But this fucking viewpoint enrages me.

1578
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:35,620
This is not 2023 stuff.

1579
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:39,540
This alone should be enough to get a rat out of me.

1580
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,620
But you know what's happening now?

1581
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,660
It's going one step further.

1582
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:51,220
Now all the pinheads are coming out and supporting this guy.

1583
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,220
Like Tim the Tap Man.

1584
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:53,500
Tim the Tap Man.

1585
01:22:53,500 --> 01:23:00,560
I swear to God, I read Tim the Tam Tams when I read that at first, who apparently is also

1586
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,820
a Call of Duty high profile streamer, 5 million YouTube subscribers and a billion views.

1587
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:06,820
Called on-

1588
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,380
Oh, don't we just have Tim Tams instead?

1589
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,380
How about it?

1590
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:14,020
Called on Activision to remove his bundle in support of my friend.

1591
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:16,580
Nick Merks has been my friend for years.

1592
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:19,420
We went in getting our Call of Duty operations together.

1593
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:23,020
It feels wrong for me to have mine and him no longer have his.

1594
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:28,060
In support of my friend, please remove the Tim the Tap Man bundle at Call of Duty.

1595
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:35,140
And then that 40 year old man who dresses up in a wig on stream that Dr. Disrespect

1596
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:39,660
gets on there and dares to go say things like, I'm going to uninstall Call of Duty

1597
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:40,660
on stream.

1598
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,660
Excuse me.

1599
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:42,660
Who was-

1600
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:43,660
Let's see.

1601
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:44,660
Again.

1602
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:45,660
What was-

1603
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,660
I'm sorry.

1604
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,660
What was the tweet that pissed me off?

1605
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:50,340
Nick Merks said they should leave little children alone.

1606
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,340
What-

1607
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,340
Remind me.

1608
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,140
Why was Dr. Disrespect banned from Twitch?

1609
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,900
He's also banned from YouTube, I think.

1610
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:57,900
Oh yeah.

1611
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:04,240
He took a camera into a bathroom where underage people were at E3.

1612
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:11,640
You dumb fucks are just showing your entire asses and not in the cool Ichiban kind of

1613
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,640
way.

1614
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:18,160
You are just showing why you deserve to have no followers.

1615
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:22,640
So as far as I'm concerned, you all can fuck off into the sun.

1616
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,720
And I hope Activision tells you as much.

1617
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:30,380
And to be honest, I have never wanted to play Call of Duty more in my life.

1618
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,680
You need to give the props where props are due.

1619
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,920
I understand.

1620
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:38,800
We've given Activision a lot of shit on this show over the years and rightfully so.

1621
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,760
Their CEO is still a master cock monger idiot.

1622
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,520
I cannot stand him.

1623
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:46,800
However, when it's right, it's right.

1624
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:53,120
And I will say good job Activision for what you're doing on this and props to you.

1625
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:58,040
And honestly, I want to play Call of Duty to support what you're doing.

1626
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:59,840
I do.

1627
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:05,320
I never thought those words would leave my mouth.

1628
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:12,600
But thank you for standing by and say that this language isn't fucking okay.

1629
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:16,400
And yeah, if this is the kind of shit that's going to leave your mouth, you deserve to

1630
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,480
be deplatformed.

1631
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,320
I don't have a Call of Duty skin on the store.

1632
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,280
I'm not entitled to it.

1633
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,460
Neither are you.

1634
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:36,940
So if you're going to conduct yourself like a massive twat, then good riddance.

1635
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:40,800
Maybe you can start a GoFundMe or something and a bunch of dumb fucks can pay your bills

1636
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,800
or something.

1637
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:47,780
All your scummy little fans that are standing by you through all this.

1638
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:53,520
Anyway, Djurama S points out that wasn't why he was removed from Twitch, but it should

1639
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,520
have been.

1640
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:55,520
Yeah, probably.

1641
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:57,280
I'm pretty sure he got a temp ban for that.

1642
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,400
It was all those temp bans that added up.

1643
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:04,120
But we're...he's...that guy...

1644
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:12,680
Anyway, and if you're following these people, I really need you to evaluate.

1645
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:16,340
Because honestly, again, I want to make this very clear.

1646
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:18,260
They should leave little children alone.

1647
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,360
That's the real issue.

1648
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,640
Who is they?

1649
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,960
LGBT folks?

1650
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,400
Because that's me.

1651
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,760
That's Dark Sakura.

1652
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:29,520
That's a lot of people in our audience that listen to this show.

1653
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:37,000
You're okay with somebody saying that, insinuating, allowing that conclusion that we want to whatever

1654
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,200
with kids?

1655
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,940
You're okay with that?

1656
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:47,120
Fuck out of here.

1657
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,600
I think I threw up in my mouth a little.

1658
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,600
I did too.

1659
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,520
And this is...it's the whole thing is, again, if y'all are going to say, stop making stupid

1660
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:58,640
people famous when talking about the Kardashians, then you need to mean it here too.

1661
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:02,080
Stop making these dumb fucks famous.

1662
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,080
I was so happy.

1663
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:07,580
I mean, I'd heard of Dr. Disrespect, but only because of the other dumb things he's done

1664
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,580
over the years.

1665
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:13,120
But I hadn't heard of the Tam Tam guy or this other guy who I apparently had blocked already

1666
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:19,960
on Twitter, probably over something else moronic that he'd said at some point.

1667
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,240
Not in my gaming community.

1668
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,240
Get the fuck out.

1669
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:26,480
I'm glad Activision showed him the door.

1670
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:31,480
Anyway, I don't know what better transition...

1671
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,360
One thing they did right?

1672
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,680
Yeah, no, we have to give credit where credit is due.

1673
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:40,320
There are a lot of problems at Activision, 100%.

1674
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,200
This was the right decision.

1675
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:47,040
This shows a culture of trying to change and do the right thing.

1676
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:52,120
This is movement in the right direction, and it must be called out and it must be backed

1677
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:54,920
up and applauded.

1678
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:59,520
Anyway, I don't know how else to follow up this story, but I think a serial killer story

1679
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,520
sounds pretty good.

1680
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:03,240
So Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1681
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:09,000
Well, actually, my thing is starting off on the music composer.

1682
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,480
Oh, sure.

1683
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:18,000
How many of y'all listening are familiar with Harry Manfredini?

1684
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,360
I bet if I played the song, you'd know.

1685
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:26,200
Well, we can play it if we won't get, you know...

1686
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,440
I shouldn't risk it, but you can hum it.

1687
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:29,440
All right.

1688
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,240
Well, no, just think kill, kill, kill, die, die, die.

1689
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,240
Anyway.

1690
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,240
There you go.

1691
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:48,000
So anyway, so Harry Manfredini is the composer for all the music in the Friday 13th series

1692
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,760
and the games.

1693
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:58,080
And now the game itself, the game that's been out right now, their publisher, Gun Media,

1694
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:02,560
announced that their license for Friday the 13th is going to expire and the game won't

1695
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,920
be for sale after this year.

1696
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:12,520
So moving on, while that's been...

1697
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:19,920
On one hand, there's already so many other things going like a Peacock TV series, but

1698
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,120
another video game is in the works.

1699
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:30,920
And it was Manfredini who broke it by saying that he was doing the music for it.

1700
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:39,120
There was a Crystal Lake reunion event that was in New Jersey and he said that he was

1701
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:44,640
working on music for another game that has yet to be officially announced and he can't

1702
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,960
really say much about it.

1703
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,280
I think he kind of let that going a bit more.

1704
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:53,120
But he did say the new game will feature more realistic looking characters and have different

1705
01:29:53,120 --> 01:30:01,240
gameplay as compared to the previous asymmetrical experience.

1706
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:14,480
So there is a lot more projects involved in the whole Return to Crystal Lake series that's

1707
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:15,960
going to be on...

1708
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:19,840
Sorry, Crystal Lake series that's going to be on Peacock.

1709
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:26,680
But they're apparently going to have a lot more and it looks like the video game doesn't

1710
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,680
have a release date clearly because all we had was this tease and the TV show doesn't

1711
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:32,000
have a release date yet.

1712
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,160
So we'll have to keep our eyes on it.

1713
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:38,000
Well, and now they have to let the old game sunset.

1714
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,200
I don't know if you heard that this week, but the current asymmetrical game...

1715
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,920
That's what I said at the beginning of the article.

1716
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,800
Yeah, it's going to go, phew.

1717
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,840
But it is interesting because this all lends itself to...

1718
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,560
I think a lot of people jump to the conclusion that, oh, Jason's going to be in Dead by Daylight

1719
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,800
because the original asymmetrical game is sunsetting, but not so fast.

1720
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,960
Well, I mean, why not both anyway?

1721
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:03,960
I mean...

1722
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:04,960
It could.

1723
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:05,960
We could text Chainsaw Massacre.

1724
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,960
We have Bubba.

1725
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,960
Yeah.

1726
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,960
Could happen.

1727
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:15,400
Although I really wish Bubba had gone because I hate him and I'm going to hate having to

1728
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,240
adapt him.

1729
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,040
I have to think of how to make a non-threatening looking Bubba so that people just feel sorry

1730
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,440
for me.

1731
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,920
He has that purple suit thing that's a little silly.

1732
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,040
I haven't wear the suit in the Lunch Lady wig.

1733
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,040
There you go.

1734
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,040
Yeah.

1735
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:33,320
But, um, yeah.

1736
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:36,600
So I'm, I liked the Friday the 13th game.

1737
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,920
I think it's a shame what happened with all the legal fuckery with that game, because

1738
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,920
that game kind of deserved a better ending than it got.

1739
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,920
And I see in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, SheHulk10 says, good night to

1740
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,720
the last Friday the 13th game.

1741
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,680
It is awesome and should make us nervous about what we own digitally.

1742
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,520
It'll be unplayable December 31st, 2024.

1743
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:57,520
Yeah.

1744
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,760
Kind of sucks that the servers are going to be kaput.

1745
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,440
But until then, you know, it was a great game for what it was.

1746
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:09,120
It's a bummer that the legal issues just caused it to grind to a halt.

1747
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:15,560
Speaking of scary games sunsetting on a tangent, I'm sure you heard about this Dark Sakura

1748
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:19,080
Video Horse Society or VHS also announced this week.

1749
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:25,480
It will be leaving as of, I think, October, September, October.

1750
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,080
I didn't hear about that.

1751
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,080
Oh yeah.

1752
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,080
Yeah.

1753
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,080
VHS is done.

1754
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,520
It didn't do well?

1755
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,520
Yeah.

1756
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,720
And they did not have the player base basically to substantiate, which is interesting.

1757
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:40,200
That game had so much hype and then they pulled it offline.

1758
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:44,400
It was the exact same thing that happened to Hive social app.

1759
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:48,880
Everybody jumped on it for a couple of weeks and then they pulled it offline for like months

1760
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,880
and nobody went back.

1761
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:54,240
Well, I shouldn't say nobody, but not enough people went back that were there the first

1762
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,240
time.

1763
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:59,760
They just put out a whole bunch of new content and you know, a lot of people loved it.

1764
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:09,040
So I'll be honest, I hated the forced voice chat, I mean, but I mean, that's sad.

1765
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,040
Yeah.

1766
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:13,520
So that's another horror, asymmetrical horror game that's biting the dust.

1767
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,680
Rest of Pepperoni.

1768
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:16,680
Yeah.

1769
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:17,840
RIP MPs.

1770
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,040
I think you can still play it like, and they gave out a code to give you a ton of the cosmetics

1771
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,640
and stuff, but yeah, it's, it's unfortunate.

1772
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:26,640
All right.

1773
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,240
Are they doing a full server shutdown or?

1774
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,240
Yeah.

1775
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Full.

1776
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,240
You won't be able to play it after a certain day.

1777
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,240
So.

1778
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,040
Well, then you know that there's going to be private servers popping up.

1779
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,680
I'm sure they'll figure something out.

1780
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:37,680
Yeah.

1781
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:38,680
All right.

1782
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:41,000
Loki, I promised earlier we could talk a little more about this.

1783
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,400
You love this company, right?

1784
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,400
Yeah.

1785
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:44,400
Devolver Digital.

1786
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:49,020
They had their digital showcase, didn't show off a ton of games, but they had four games

1787
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:52,080
that they showed off and they were all pretty good looking.

1788
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:59,600
So we had Wizard with a Gun, which is an isometric survival game that's themed around fantasy

1789
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,560
with the Western.

1790
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:06,680
And there's also, you build, you know, construct buildings and collect resources to survive

1791
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:07,680
in the game.

1792
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:08,680
So that's pretty sweet.

1793
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,760
It's supposed to be coming out sometime this year.

1794
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:13,840
The Talos Principle 2 looks incredible.

1795
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,560
I haven't played the first one, but I really wanted to play the first one.

1796
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:23,720
It's a great first person puzzler, and that's supposed to be coming out here also this year

1797
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,720
as well.

1798
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,480
Human Fall Flat 2.

1799
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:29,480
Pretty cool looking.

1800
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,920
It's a third person puzzler game.

1801
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:36,120
And then my favorite, Baby Steps.

1802
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:41,200
Baby Steps is what they call a literal walking simulator.

1803
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,280
This is by Bennett Foddy.

1804
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:49,000
You may remember them from Getting Over It, a very frustrating game, also a game that

1805
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,280
they made a while back called QWOP.

1806
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:56,760
And well, it is sort of the most annoying fucking game you'll ever play in your life.

1807
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:02,760
Imagine a 3D version of QWOP, but it's also an RPG, and that's what you got.

1808
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,040
And it looks ridiculous.

1809
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,320
And I love it.

1810
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:11,320
And that'll be coming out sometime next year.

1811
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:12,320
That's it.

1812
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,760
All right.

1813
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,760
Sounds like fun.

1814
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:15,760
All right.

1815
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,560
Moving on to a story that's kind of developing as we went into OLR tonight.

1816
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:23,240
I just kind of put a placeholder here because I knew that Square Enix was going live at

1817
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:28,440
4 o'clock to do a deeper dive into Final Fantasy 16 and make some big announcements, including

1818
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:31,680
a demo was expected to come out of this event.

1819
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,680
And it did.

1820
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:37,960
They did announce that a demo of Final Fantasy 16 will be released tomorrow on PlayStation

1821
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:38,960
5.

1822
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:43,000
If you want to get real exact, 1 o'clock Pacific, 4 a.m. Eastern this morning is when

1823
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,600
that'll go live.

1824
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,680
And this is, they're saying a two hour basically prologue.

1825
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:51,040
And then once you beat it, you get like a battle demo that unlocks.

1826
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,480
So I'm guessing the prologue probably doesn't maybe have a ton of gameplay in it.

1827
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,840
It might be a lot of cut scenes to set you up for it, I would imagine.

1828
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,920
But the save data can carry over into the main game.

1829
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:07,200
So essentially you can start playing Final Fantasy 16 tomorrow, but just the first couple

1830
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,200
hours.

1831
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,320
So I'm very excited about that as somebody who's excited about 16.

1832
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:18,080
Also, you know, they obviously did some, you know, other announcements about the game.

1833
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,760
Some very interesting collaborators on this game.

1834
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:27,720
It was announced also the Kingdom Hearts development team helped to develop Final Fantasy 16.

1835
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:33,800
And Platinum Games helped to develop a part of Final Fantasy 16.

1836
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,800
What the fuck is going on with all these teams lending a hand to Final Fantasy 16?

1837
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,040
I think I know what it is.

1838
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,040
Any cooks in the kitchen?

1839
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,840
No, I think I know what it is.

1840
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,960
Because they talked about this.

1841
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,920
They said the icon battles in the game in an earlier direct, they said the icon battles

1842
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:52,280
would all be very different and unique and take inspiration from other types of games.

1843
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:57,480
So I have a feeling Platinum Games probably did one of the icon battles.

1844
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,560
Kingdom Hearts team probably did one of the icon battles.

1845
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,840
And that's why it's a part of the game.

1846
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:06,520
But that's still pretty neat because that shows that there really is going to be some

1847
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,120
variety with the game and some of these battles.

1848
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:15,280
So I'm very excited to see kind of the credits are going to be like three hours long just

1849
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,920
to watch the credits are going to be as long as this prologue playable demo.

1850
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,700
But sounds like it'll be very interesting.

1851
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:24,260
So that is out again tonight.

1852
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,240
Also going with that, there's some merch.

1853
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:31,840
If you want to get yourself a Torgal little plushie, that's right, the little dog that

1854
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:37,440
you can have in the game that you can pet apparently is going to be a plushie.

1855
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:42,320
You can get one for either $39.99 or $120.

1856
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:46,240
I'm going to guess one is probably four times bigger than the other as far as the plush

1857
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,240
sizes.

1858
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,720
I haven't been able to research all the details on that yet.

1859
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:54,080
They're also putting up a little moogle, some jewelry, and they put out a brand new trailer

1860
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,600
that I haven't watched yet, but it's called the Ascension trailer.

1861
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:02,360
So the hype is building up for that game, which releases in 11 days.

1862
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,200
So busy summer.

1863
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,500
All right, moving on.

1864
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,480
More game announcements, Dark Sakura.

1865
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:17,320
Well, oh, sorry, I had accidentally closed it.

1866
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:22,520
Anyway, we love Kojima, don't we?

1867
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:23,520
Do we?

1868
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,520
No, we do.

1869
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:25,520
We do.

1870
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:34,200
But at any rate, me as a Mac gamer, I am super, super happy for this, is that the Death Stranding

1871
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,640
director's cut will be on Mac.

1872
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,840
I'm so happy.

1873
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:48,520
I mean, I was already down to play it, but now I actually will get to play it natively

1874
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:49,840
on my Mac.

1875
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:55,960
And he's also committed to bringing other future games out on Mac, you know, good triple

1876
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:57,680
A titles.

1877
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:01,200
And I'm feeling pretty happy about that.

1878
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:09,320
Capcom's already on the ball too, with them having released Resident Evil Village on Mac.

1879
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:12,360
So we're seeing some good stuff, very happy.

1880
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:18,800
There was a quick little footnote out of Worldwide Developers Conference 2.

1881
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:24,200
It's really a much bigger deal than I think they made it out to be.

1882
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,800
It was kind of announced as an asterisk, and this is actually a huge deal.

1883
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,120
And I'm sorry, I don't know all the details, because again, I'm not a Mac gamer.

1884
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:34,800
But my understanding is they released some type of driver, basically, that's supposed

1885
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:39,520
to make DirectX stuff, I think that's what it is, a lot easier to kind of run natively

1886
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,520
on Mac.

1887
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,600
So long story short, they kind of slipped in updates to game drivers that actually are

1888
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:50,200
going to make PC games more likely to run natively on a Mac, basically.

1889
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:55,960
So this may not be the last that we see something poured over, which would make Whoopi Goldberg

1890
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:59,960
very happy because she's pissed off Diablo 4 isn't on Mac, because Blizzard usually puts

1891
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,240
their stuff out on Mac, but they didn't put this one out.

1892
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,920
So maybe this will be the juice that Blizzard needs.

1893
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:06,920
I don't know.

1894
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:11,960
So how about that headset for $3,500?

1895
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,360
There's a reason I didn't talk about it tonight.

1896
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:14,800
I don't see it as a gaming device.

1897
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,800
Not yet.

1898
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:16,800
Anyway.

1899
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,800
I mean, it was...

1900
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:19,800
If I may.

1901
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:20,800
Sure.

1902
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,960
It's a virtual computer environment.

1903
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:25,200
And it was...

1904
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:32,160
It is a computer, but you are using screens and keyboard and everything in a tailored

1905
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,160
virtual environment.

1906
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:38,480
And it's the developers conference, like the first iPhone was a little like it took a while

1907
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:41,960
for that to catch on to like, I kind of feel like this is one of those things was like,

1908
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:46,240
this device isn't for me, but it's for the people that are going to create the big ideas

1909
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,120
for this environment.

1910
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:51,960
And you know, let's see what this looks like five years down the line.

1911
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:57,160
I'm really thinking of its potential with accessibility.

1912
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:58,800
So I'm pretty...

1913
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,200
I know I can't afford one, but I'm pretty excited to see where computing goes in the

1914
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,200
next 10 years.

1915
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:09,680
I mean, I understand why they called it what they did, because they can say they invented

1916
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:10,680
it.

1917
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,360
And to be honest, like it's a mixed messaging anyways, because if it's supposed to be like

1918
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:19,920
a con for corporations to replace their computers or something like that, but then they're also

1919
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,080
saying, but you can experience all this stuff with Disney Plus and stuff like that.

1920
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,920
So it's very mixed messaging what they're trying to do with it.

1921
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,920
But yeah, the tech's cool.

1922
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,000
And hopefully it drives other people to make tech just as well.

1923
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,520
So if nothing else, Apple has extended the life of AR VR with this, you know, like, I

1924
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:43,000
think that this is going to be a part of the conversation for a much longer time.

1925
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,920
I think people like Zuckerberg, who kind of is dismissive of this, because he has to be,

1926
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,600
you know, it's essentially competition to the meta quest, but secretly, he ought to

1927
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:56,480
be thanking them for keeping this at the forefront of people's mind and all this stuff.

1928
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,400
It's going to cause VR and AR to have more to go with.

1929
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:03,800
Because honestly, a lot of what they were talking about sounds similar to like the Hololens

1930
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:07,240
thing that I tried that Bobby had like years ago.

1931
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:11,800
But it's just the technology is much more refined five years down the line, and it's

1932
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:15,200
just going to get more and more refined five years from now.

1933
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:22,120
So I got excited watching people using the software that I use for a lot of my video

1934
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,600
editing and my audio editing, I thought it was pretty neat.

1935
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,600
Yeah.

1936
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,600
And you make a good point.

1937
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:32,320
It could do some very interesting things for accessibility, which, you know, to be fair,

1938
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:36,560
let's talk about Microsoft and connect, even though it didn't, you know, it was a flash

1939
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:41,200
in the pan for gaming, we'll say, connect still did a lot for accessibility and its

1940
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:45,320
usage in, you know, sterile environments as well and what it can do.

1941
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:50,080
And so it'll be interesting to see kind of what this brings to the table for unique environments

1942
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,080
and things like that.

1943
01:42:51,080 --> 01:42:56,680
But I just think like, it's just not part of the conversation right now as a mass consumer

1944
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,880
device.

1945
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,000
This is a peek at the future.

1946
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,400
If they ever decide to drop it down like to, you know, $200 someday.

1947
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,240
I'd say a thousand, drop it down to a thousand, I'm interested.

1948
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:17,040
There's no possible way that's going to be anything less than even $1,500 on resell or

1949
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,040
anything like that.

1950
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,040
I'm talking like far in the future.

1951
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:25,040
I mean, like, what happens, what happens every time Apple announces something, the phone,

1952
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:30,360
the watch, that all the other people are going to come out of the woodwork, the Samsungs,

1953
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:35,120
they're all going to come out of the woodwork and come out with their cheaper responses.

1954
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,560
And some people love that stuff.

1955
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,560
Some people don't.

1956
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,280
You get the choice as a consumer.

1957
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,640
So there's just, this is just going to open the door again.

1958
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:52,940
The life of ARVR has been given a new, this is a time extent on VR AR and will allow this

1959
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:54,040
whole thing to catch on more.

1960
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:59,880
Just saying you can finally realize what Pokemon Go should have been or make Ingress even that

1961
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:01,620
much better.

1962
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:03,820
Can we talk about what Ingress just implemented?

1963
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:07,860
Because it's garbage, garbage.

1964
01:44:07,860 --> 01:44:09,940
It's overclock hacking, but it's fine.

1965
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:14,260
It's a point to using the scans, the Pokestop scans and all this stuff.

1966
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:18,700
Because all the scans are so terrible, it doesn't work.

1967
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:22,300
Like I'll tap the ground to put the cube on the ground to try to hack it.

1968
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:26,660
And the cube flies up in the tree because it thinks the tree is the ground.

1969
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:35,300
Because it's, anyway, I digress, but that is not the future of AR, that's for sure.

1970
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:39,500
I had been thinking about this, something I was talking to another friend about is,

1971
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:45,860
and this actually goes back to a documentary I was watching about some surgeons using Bluetooth

1972
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:54,740
to connect a, well, a former quadriplegic, he's now just missing the use of his legs,

1973
01:44:54,740 --> 01:45:01,300
but he was fully paralyzed before, and they're using Bluetooth to connect segments of his

1974
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:07,860
upper spinal cord with the lower end to send the signals from the brain using Bluetooth

1975
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:08,860
to the lower extremities.

1976
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:15,940
And he has to use a pretty hefty brace for it, but he's been able, and the equipment

1977
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:23,220
is still pretty hardcore right now, but he was able to walk up a flight of steps by himself

1978
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:24,220
using Bluetooth.

1979
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:31,220
And if you think about implementing technology like that with a computer like this, someone

1980
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:39,080
can actually do any kind of work that someone with full use of their body would be able

1981
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:40,080
to do.

1982
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:46,100
And I think that just looking at how these technologies can overlap, because, I mean,

1983
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:50,220
and again, this is not a VR headset, this is a whole computer.

1984
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:54,540
And I think that it would be just really awesome to have those sorts of things out

1985
01:45:54,540 --> 01:46:01,020
in the medical community so that it can go to benefit people who might need the extra

1986
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:02,020
assistance.

1987
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:11,180
I mean, there is so much happening right now just in the field of bionics and cybernetics

1988
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:14,020
that I'm impressed, I really am.

1989
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:17,980
Not the AI stuff, not so much.

1990
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:21,420
You have to have a degree of machine learning to advance it.

1991
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:22,420
Technology is so fucking rad.

1992
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:26,300
I just think of as a diabetic and watching some of the things that my grandma, when she

1993
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:31,820
had it, having to monitor her blood sugar so many times a day, but now I see people

1994
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:32,820
that are type 1 di...

1995
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:38,260
I'm not type 1, so I still have some insulin, I just have to watch what I eat basically.

1996
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:42,360
But I look at type 1 diabetic friends and now with the help of constant glucose monitors

1997
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:47,820
as well as insulin pumps and phones that kind of bridge between them, you basically have

1998
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:50,900
a robotic pancreas is basically what it is now.

1999
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:54,580
But technology allows that without you having to draw your blood a million times a day because

2000
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:58,940
you have the CGM that does that and then the insulin pump that says, oh, the blood sugar

2001
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:03,300
is a certain level, we're going to just automatically get the insulin going and all that stuff.

2002
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:04,300
It's amazing.

2003
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:10,720
And to tie it back to Apple or whoever doing these types of technologies, it's a pretty

2004
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:16,580
not well kept secret that a space that Apple wants to get into with the Apple Watch is

2005
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:19,140
blood-free glucose monitoring.

2006
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:22,940
And it's a technology that they're working on, they're not there yet, but when they get

2007
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:29,420
there, that Apple Watch, let's be real, eventually the technology will get swiped by other companies

2008
01:47:29,420 --> 01:47:30,420
too.

2009
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:35,560
But when Apple does it, that Apple Watch will be transformative.

2010
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:40,680
As a diabetic, I can't think of something I want more than something that monitors my

2011
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,900
blood sugar like that, as long as it's accurate, but they're not going to release something

2012
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:48,100
like that until they have approval from the FDA, just like the electrocardiogram thing.

2013
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,100
Exactly.

2014
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:55,180
And that electrocardiogram in the fall detection has actually saved lives of people that I

2015
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,180
know.

2016
01:47:56,180 --> 01:48:06,900
So I'm just going to go out there and say that I'm absolutely in awe.

2017
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:07,940
Technology is fucking rad.

2018
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:10,220
I love living in the future.

2019
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:16,300
And the thing is, is that we grew up as this technology grew up.

2020
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:17,300
We've been moving.

2021
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:20,760
See, people are saying that, oh, it's, you know, millennials, blah, blah, blah.

2022
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:26,820
This is going to be the ones, you know, who are keeping the tech industry, you know, the

2023
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:30,180
innovations in tech going, but like, no, it's actually us who grew up with it.

2024
01:48:30,180 --> 01:48:35,500
We've seen where it's been firsthand and we know where it can go firsthand.

2025
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:40,120
So yeah, you know, I mean, I'm not, I'm not just

2026
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:45,700
counting any other, I hate the whole generational argument, but I am just thinking that we in

2027
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:53,460
particular are in this place where we remember going out to play outside and having pixel

2028
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:56,420
graphics and computers with cassette tapes.

2029
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:03,100
But we also appreciate, you know, our high end systems and our Mac books and, you know,

2030
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:06,760
being able to go on a virtual walk and everything.

2031
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:07,760
So.

2032
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:08,760
All right.

2033
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,700
Well, let's move on.

2034
01:49:10,700 --> 01:49:13,940
Let's talk about, let's talk about something else that might need to grow up a little bit

2035
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:16,580
in our next story.

2036
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:17,580
Yeah.

2037
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:24,120
So there was the whole, I guess it was a blog post that was put out by Twitch talking about

2038
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:31,300
changes to their ad policy, basically that they wouldn't allow burned in ads to display,

2039
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:34,300
you know, video or audio ads and that type of stuff.

2040
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:35,880
And then everybody was pissed off about it.

2041
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:42,220
So then they said, no, no, no, no, no, you have misinterpreted or then they walked it

2042
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:47,380
back even further saying today's branded content policy update was overly broad and it's create

2043
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,460
confusion and frustration.

2044
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:51,080
And we apologize for that.

2045
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:57,100
And then I want to say that they added something to that, like that it was just, yeah, we,

2046
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:01,940
we do not intend to limit streamer's ability to enter into direct relationships with sponsors.

2047
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:05,280
And we understand that this is an important part of how streamers earn revenue.

2048
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,680
We want to clarify our existing ad policy was intended to prohibit third party ad networks

2049
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:14,540
from selling burned in video and display ads on Twitch, which is consistent with other

2050
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:15,540
services.

2051
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:21,060
We missed the mark with our policy language and we'll rewrite the guidelines to be clear.

2052
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:26,700
It's almost as if you consulted with your partners and or affiliates before making these

2053
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:31,460
announcements, they might tell you some of this feedback.

2054
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:33,160
Yeah.

2055
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:37,520
And then it's still in their policy though, that saying that you can't do the burn in

2056
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:41,400
ads either, but it'll be interesting to see how they enforce it because YouTube has a

2057
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,980
similar type of thing, but they don't care.

2058
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:46,980
They just allow that to happen for the most part.

2059
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:52,520
I think it's when they were talking about like major players, like just selling ads.

2060
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:57,540
So imagine if you will, like a stream labs or something like that selling that ad space

2061
01:50:57,540 --> 01:50:58,540
or something like that.

2062
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:00,120
To be fair to Twitch.

2063
01:51:00,120 --> 01:51:03,260
I understand why they want to be the ones selling ads.

2064
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:07,300
Like I get that to an extent, like they don't want, and I think when they clarified the

2065
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:09,540
language is that it's an ad network.

2066
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:14,180
They don't want a competing, like whoever selling, you know, ads and so forth.

2067
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:20,100
But obviously, you know, you look at a summer games done quick, a nonprofit that's bolstered

2068
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:25,380
up by having ads and sponsorship on their stream to be able to help fundraise over that.

2069
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:28,700
I don't think that's ever what Twitch intended to target, but unfortunately, because they

2070
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:33,860
didn't talk to enough people, they inadvertently did, and that's why they had to correct course

2071
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:35,400
real quick.

2072
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:40,440
As Bobby points out in chat, they made graphics for it.

2073
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:42,640
It was not broad or misinterpreted.

2074
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:43,640
Yeah.

2075
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:48,160
Like this was very well thought out on their end.

2076
01:51:48,160 --> 01:51:55,640
And as he points out, to a point, they snuck in the no simulcasting to their terms of

2077
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,020
service as well.

2078
01:51:57,020 --> 01:51:59,820
Whereas that used to be an affiliate partner contract thing.

2079
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:06,760
Now it's blanketed to everybody to which a lot of streamers are like, listen, you know,

2080
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:10,980
I can either stream to like these eight platforms or just Twitch.

2081
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:12,980
What do you think I'm going to do?

2082
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:17,060
I mean, obviously, I'm just going to stream to those other platforms and not Twitch.

2083
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:21,480
I personally think I see and I've been to many discussions on this topic over the years

2084
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:26,140
and I have yet to be won over that splitting yourself in eight different directions is

2085
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:27,580
a good idea.

2086
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:30,900
Like you have to focus on one place first.

2087
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:34,580
But that's, you know, some people disagree with me fundamentally, and that's fine.

2088
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:38,420
I do what I need to do with my brand, y'all do what you need to do with your brands.

2089
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:42,140
And that's the beauty of an open market in this space.

2090
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:48,600
So I just don't think it's a smart idea to simulcast to that many places anyway, because

2091
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:52,320
you can't, you can't monitor that many chat rooms at once by yourself.

2092
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:56,620
You can't monitor socials in that many places at once.

2093
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:58,780
So I don't know.

2094
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:01,060
But anyway, let's see other comments in chat.

2095
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:02,060
S.G.O.

2096
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:05,360
Hunter Matt says, I find it funny that Twitch made a massive deal with the WWE this week

2097
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:09,940
for simulcast type shows and shows with superstars, which would have tons of ads and sponsors

2098
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:13,660
and everything that Twitch was going to nix, granted they had a special deal with them,

2099
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:14,660
but it's funny.

2100
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:17,480
I don't think there's any irony in that at all.

2101
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,660
The thing is, is that Twitch is making money on it.

2102
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:21,260
It was their deal.

2103
01:53:21,260 --> 01:53:25,060
It's not the people on their platform making their own deal.

2104
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:26,700
There's a universe of difference.

2105
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:27,700
Yeah.

2106
01:53:27,700 --> 01:53:28,700
S.G.O.

2107
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:32,820
Hunter Matt says, folks, we're running to Kick by BlackWoolz says Kick is owned by CryptoBros.

2108
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:36,880
They don't necessarily want to address how people are abused, quote unquote, free speech.

2109
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:42,300
That's like Kick just needs to, I need Kick to prove that they're grownups before I'm

2110
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,780
going to take interest in it.

2111
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:47,100
Because right now, when I go to the site, it's casino, casino, casino, it looks, it

2112
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:49,320
just looks like a bunch of garbage.

2113
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:51,880
That's just, I'm just calling it like it is.

2114
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:57,360
For me to believe in Kick, I'm going to need to show that it's run by grownups and a really

2115
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:01,720
solid anti-harassment policy would show that it's run by grownups.

2116
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:07,760
But if they're going to take the Elon Musk approach to like, then that guy is a child

2117
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:10,880
and it is not, then that is showing that it is not being run by grownups.

2118
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:20,380
Well, I mean, their whole thing is no control and decentralization, so whatever.

2119
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,020
I'm not going to go to it.

2120
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:27,260
I'm going to keep calling them out until they, you know, if they ever do something about

2121
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:28,260
it.

2122
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:31,420
But the thing is, is that as long as people can go there and be hateful and get away with

2123
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:37,820
it because they're making more money doing it, fuck off, I'll stick with Twitch.

2124
01:54:37,820 --> 01:54:42,840
At least they've got really good policies for dealing with, they were really like the

2125
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:46,440
last round of hate raids that were going out, they're really on the ball with restricting

2126
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,440
things like that.

2127
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,440
Right.

2128
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:52,480
And it took them a minute to get there, but they're there, you know, so.

2129
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:55,720
I'm happily in their research, you know, program.

2130
01:54:55,720 --> 01:55:01,300
I'm happy to do my bit to make it better, but, you know, the big thing that they need

2131
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:07,800
to address is, you know, things like, you know, charity streams.

2132
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:14,080
I think if people are going through the built in charity extension, then I think that probably

2133
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:15,840
gets around that.

2134
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:20,000
I mean, they've got to definitely rephrase that.

2135
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,380
They're going to have to rewrite part of that agreement.

2136
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:26,240
That's just the end of the story.

2137
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:30,160
And you also can't charge somebody for something that they didn't pay for to begin with.

2138
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:32,220
I'm just going to say that.

2139
01:55:32,220 --> 01:55:33,220
All right.

2140
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:34,220
All right.

2141
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:38,420
Like for leaving something they didn't put money in to begin with, I should say.

2142
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,420
All right.

2143
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:44,900
Well, before we get to our classic game of sorts for this week, I want to talk a little

2144
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:48,660
bit about because it is June and it was actually Pride weekend here in Sacramento.

2145
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:51,860
I didn't go this year, though, with Alan being sick and everything.

2146
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:52,940
I didn't go.

2147
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:57,340
But I heard the Rebecca Black concert was really fun because that was who the headliner

2148
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:59,660
was this year was Rebecca Black.

2149
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:04,520
That Friday song is like 10 years old at this point.

2150
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:07,520
The last album she put out is legit club hits.

2151
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,600
It's actually pretty decent.

2152
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,140
I like Saturday.

2153
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:14,280
She came out as, I think, Pam a few years ago.

2154
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:19,600
She's part of the community because she's in her late 20s now.

2155
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:23,480
Friday was when she was 17 and that was 10 years ago, so she's like 27 now.

2156
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:25,880
So she's definitely come a long way.

2157
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:29,780
Anyway, but my point is, it is Pride Month and there's a lot of companies that are doing

2158
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:31,460
things for Pride Month.

2159
01:56:31,460 --> 01:56:35,820
To recap, I want to just quickly state some of the things that are going on.

2160
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:37,860
Some of these things we have brought up in prior episodes.

2161
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,180
I just want to make that clear.

2162
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:41,500
I am just recapping for Pride Month.

2163
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:43,820
What all is going on of a rainbow variety?

2164
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:48,900
Blizzard Entertainment has done some Pride updates to Overwatch 2, icons and name cards,

2165
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:57,540
and then, of course, they also confirmed Batiste and Pharah as canon in LGBTQIA community.

2166
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:01,780
They are also selling Pride-themed merchandise with the proceeds going to the National Center

2167
01:57:01,780 --> 01:57:03,520
for Transgender Equality.

2168
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:08,080
So if you want to get Diablo logo and transgender pride colors, that is something they're selling

2169
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,080
on the store right now.

2170
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:11,840
I know because I'm probably buying one.

2171
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:14,240
So that is something they're doing.

2172
01:57:14,240 --> 01:57:18,680
Crystal Dynamics is running a month-long funding raising initiative for the It Gets Better

2173
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,680
project.

2174
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:25,400
They're going to do a panel for their various studio members in the community on June 28th.

2175
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:31,020
And then on June 30th, they're going to partner with Drag Race alumnus Rock M. Sakura, who

2176
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:34,260
is very underrated in her run on that show, by the way.

2177
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:35,940
She's a very talented queen.

2178
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:38,860
She's going to host a charity stream for the It Gets Better project.

2179
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:40,620
That's all from Crystal Dynamics.

2180
01:57:40,620 --> 01:57:44,520
Darkpaw Games doing new EverQuest 2 content.

2181
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:45,520
Very cool.

2182
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:47,460
You can download that until July 9th.

2183
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:53,400
Iron Galaxy will be doing a panel as well on June 15th with their employee resource

2184
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,400
group.

2185
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:58,120
And they're going to participate in the Pride Parade in Chicago on June 25th.

2186
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:03,160
Microsoft announced a new partnership with GLAAD that's supposed to help them with their

2187
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:07,780
LGBTQIA plus storytelling and games and staffers on Xbox.

2188
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:09,280
People like to see the representation.

2189
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:10,440
It's great.

2190
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:16,080
You can also find some curated game lists for June and onward, including some transgender

2191
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:20,460
and non-binary community games collection, as well as an LGBTQIA plus community games

2192
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,820
collection.

2193
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:25,220
They're also promising Pride Month streams and other content.

2194
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:27,860
Last week on the show, I remember this got brought up, but just mentioning again, the

2195
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:33,260
Queer Games Bundle is available with over 450 games and tabletop games and so forth.

2196
01:58:33,260 --> 01:58:38,420
That's all on itch.io, but you can get more information as well on Twitter at Queer Game

2197
01:58:38,420 --> 01:58:40,180
Bundle.

2198
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:43,440
Riot Games is doing a Pride Month recognition with their players.

2199
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:48,520
You can get new icons, emotes, titles, and other content from over the years returning.

2200
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,280
That's all free for players.

2201
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:55,300
Sega announced they're going to be doing Sega Pride, a charity fundraising event for Kaleidoscope

2202
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:58,240
Trust from June 22nd to June 30th.

2203
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:02,820
That will be streamed on their official Twitch channel and organization members from Kaleidoscope

2204
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:07,420
will be answering questions about their work and the importance of the charity.

2205
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:13,600
Tybo will be doing Pride Month events as well, partnering with It Gets Better, Copenhagen

2206
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:18,200
Pride, Gay Gaming Pros, and so forth.

2207
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:22,520
Twitch is going to feature a collection of LGBTQIA plus streamers on the front page throughout

2208
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,800
the month, so that's cool.

2209
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:28,400
I guess the invite for Dark Soccer and myself got lost in the mail.

2210
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:32,640
No, I assume they're inviting partners, which is what they tend to do, so yay to our friends

2211
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:34,240
that will be there.

2212
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:41,060
Press 2 will be doing donations to the organization Mind Out, and there will also be an interview

2213
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:45,740
on Pride being featured in Alba, a wildlife adventure.

2214
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:51,060
And Zynga also partnered with It Gets Better and Take Two, and Zynga donated $50,000 to

2215
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:55,780
the initiative, which is very cool, and they will also be doing a celebration with interviews

2216
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:59,700
and staff of different genders and sexualities, and there will be Pride themed content in

2217
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:04,600
their games, zynga.com slash playwithpride, all one word.

2218
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:08,040
So you know what?

2219
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:13,840
To the streamers before who were running their mouths on Twitter about things they shouldn't

2220
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:20,140
be talking about, I just want you to see through all of those various initiatives, you are

2221
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:23,740
in the wrong.

2222
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:28,760
This rainbow tidal wave is coming, we're here, we're queer, get used to it.

2223
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:29,700
Thank you very much.

2224
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:38,180
All right, let's travel back to a simpler time when streamers weren't getting big deals

2225
02:00:38,180 --> 02:00:39,620
like this for in-game content.

2226
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:42,420
But once a month, Dark Sakura puts a twist on it.

2227
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:44,060
But first, I'm going to run the bumper.

2228
02:00:44,060 --> 02:01:00,000
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

2229
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
out a classic and tell you about it.

2230
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,800
It's time for the classic game of the week.

2231
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:10,600
But once a month, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game to highlight.

2232
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,240
What did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?

2233
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:18,820
I picked mousetrap, as in the board game mousetrap.

2234
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:19,820
It's mechanical.

2235
02:01:19,820 --> 02:01:21,940
There's things that move, right?

2236
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:23,440
No, I love this choice.

2237
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:26,200
I fucking love this game.

2238
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:34,920
So the original mousetrap board game was first published by Ideal in 1963 for two to four

2239
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:35,920
players.

2240
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:40,660
And it was one of the first mass produced three dimensional board games.

2241
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:47,140
Basically you are building a giant mousetrap in the style of a Rube Goldberg machine.

2242
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:53,540
And the point is to trap the opponent's mice.

2243
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:59,140
And there's actually, the gameplay has changed over time, even though the playfield has not.

2244
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:06,860
So the original premise of it was that, and first of all, this was invented, the concept

2245
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:11,660
of it was invented by Marvin Glass and a designer named Gordon Barlow.

2246
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:19,380
They were for Marvin Glass and Associates, and they got their patent for it in 1967.

2247
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:27,440
The original version of it was supposed to be a game that the players didn't get a lot

2248
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,780
of choice in, as far as how to play it.

2249
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:37,680
Multiple rules, almost no decision making, something that was sort of patterned after

2250
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:43,040
Candylander Chutes and Ladders, or originally Stakes and Ladders.

2251
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:48,340
You would take turn rolling a die, and to move your little mouse guy across the game

2252
02:02:48,340 --> 02:02:58,640
board, and you go from the start in a continuous loop at the end, the little path would go.

2253
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:04,400
There is a mouse trap that's assembled in the center of the board, and as you land on

2254
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:09,760
build spaces, you would add another piece to the mouse trap and build it as you go along.

2255
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:15,120
So it's always built in the same order.

2256
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:23,060
And then along the end loop are a lot more build spaces, so that if the trap isn't finished,

2257
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:25,120
it can be completed.

2258
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:31,280
And there's a cheese space that's right underneath where the cage will go, and a turn crank space.

2259
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:39,320
So if someone lands on turn crank, when an opponent is on the cheese space, you turn

2260
02:03:39,320 --> 02:03:44,280
the crank and it launches the machine, and if it works properly, if you weren't missing

2261
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:50,040
parts, the cage would fall on the cheese space, and the opponent gets eliminated from the

2262
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:51,040
game.

2263
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:57,520
The last one winning is the last one who doesn't get caged is the winner.

2264
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:07,360
So the game was redesigned, the board was, in 1975 with adding cheese pieces that could

2265
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:12,600
allow you to push opponents into the trap space.

2266
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:17,200
You would get these tokens, and if the trap is vacant, when you land on turn crank, you

2267
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:23,400
use the token to roll a die to move an opponent.

2268
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:28,480
Modified version in the UK had three mouse traps, the special trigger that would work

2269
02:04:28,480 --> 02:04:37,160
at random, and a different board game, different components, and instead of the model bathtub,

2270
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:44,080
they had a model toilet that would trigger everything.

2271
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:48,880
And then of course, there were other versions of it, there was one from Elephant and Friends

2272
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:57,040
in 2014, you had a barrel instead of a dice, and all kinds of different changes, but the

2273
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,920
trap is built before the start of the game.

2274
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:05,840
In 2010, Classic Mouse Trap was re-released, it had some major changes.

2275
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:10,840
The object this time was to collect six cheese pieces, and instead of being eliminated from

2276
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:15,800
the game when you're caught in the trap, you had to forfeit a piece of cheese to the

2277
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:18,400
opponent who traps you.

2278
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:22,440
And then of course the trap was modified so that you don't use a crank, you just press

2279
02:05:22,440 --> 02:05:23,440
a lever.

2280
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:27,520
It's got a plastic stop sign on it.

2281
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:33,880
Now a little bit more about the history of the game.

2282
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:43,000
Firstly, Marvin Glass did state that he was greatly influenced by Rube Goldberg's illustrations,

2283
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:47,120
but they didn't want to pay the licensing or royalty fees.

2284
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:52,320
He also did two other games that were based on Goldberg designs, one called Crazy Clock

2285
02:05:52,320 --> 02:06:00,640
Game in 1964, and Fish Bait Game in 1965, neither credit Goldberg.

2286
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:05,240
Which would have opened the door for Goldberg to have pursued legal action, but at the time

2287
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:11,360
he was really old and close to retirement, and he decided not to take the legal action

2288
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:16,960
because as it said, inspiration and ideas are not intellectual property that can be

2289
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:20,320
protected by a copyright, trademark, or patent.

2290
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:25,720
What he did, however, was he sold the licensing right for his drawings to another company

2291
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:35,680
called Model Products so that the royalties would go to someone else.

2292
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:41,160
So that Glass could never get them.

2293
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:47,000
And really both of those games are other, like I said, Rube Goldberg-esque machines.

2294
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:59,880
One of them is that you have to operate the machine and whoever is the first one to succeed

2295
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:03,720
with the installation is the winner, and then the Fish Bait Game is that you are fishermen

2296
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:09,040
who have to catch a man eating fish.

2297
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:16,560
As far as legacies go, in 1990, Mouse Trap was adapted into a board game as part of a

2298
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:23,760
British children's show called Motormouth, and the contestants took the place of the

2299
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,000
mice in the life-size board game.

2300
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:32,880
And then there is the thing that I think I told you about earlier, Rob.

2301
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:42,520
Mark Perez of San Francisco formed a ginormous, giant, what he calls life-size mousetrap.

2302
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:52,000
It is 16 pieces, 500,000-pound interactive connective sculpture that's set up on a 6,500-square-foot

2303
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:00,400
game board, and it has a little vaudeville-style show and a music score by a one-woman band

2304
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:02,640
named Esmeralda Strange.

2305
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:09,040
You have sexy mice, can-can dancers, clown workers, acrobats, and other scenes that are

2306
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:13,760
dedicated to the game.

2307
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:24,520
It gets traveled and assembled by 25 tons of cranes and equipment in a semi-truck.

2308
02:08:24,520 --> 02:08:29,800
The ball bearing, they use a bowling ball instead, and it ends with the destruction

2309
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:33,000
of an automobile by dropping a safe on it.

2310
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,480
They drop in a literal old-style bank safe on a car.

2311
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:38,480
That's awesome.

2312
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:39,720
It's very rewarding.

2313
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:42,040
You can't actually play it.

2314
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:48,920
You can't play on it as the ball, but you can watch the ball eventually break things.

2315
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:50,240
And even Smithsonian Magazine-

2316
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:54,720
And yes, I'm trying to show that part of it live here on stream, trying to get to that

2317
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:57,000
part where the safe will crash the car.

2318
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,360
We're almost there.

2319
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:02,880
And you see the moving parts on it and everything, that's pretty cool.

2320
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:12,440
But Smithsonian Magazine reports that the exhibit's merit teaches physics and simple

2321
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:13,440
machines.

2322
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:17,920
So, there you go.

2323
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:26,760
Mouse trap inspired by Rube Goldberg and inspiring dudes from San Francisco to crash cars with

2324
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:30,280
a safe using a bowling ball.

2325
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:36,040
There you go.

2326
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:38,380
I'm sorry, I've been muted this whole time while I'm talking.

2327
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:39,880
There it is, your classic game of the week, mouse trap.

2328
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:43,140
Sorry, I was trying to double close all those windows because you had like four different

2329
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:44,800
movies playing as B-roll there.

2330
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:51,560
But yeah, mouse trap inspiring different arts and all that good stuff.

2331
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,080
So, great pick.

2332
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:58,480
I think a lot of us remember that game from when we were younger, even if we never actually-

2333
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:02,200
I think people in chat were saying, I didn't actually play the game, I just like to build

2334
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:03,200
the trap.

2335
02:10:03,200 --> 02:10:04,200
Exactly.

2336
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:12,400
I did post an image in the chat and I wish I had a way to share this with the podcast

2337
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:20,920
listeners of a picture from an eBay listing of an original 1963 mouse trap.

2338
02:10:20,920 --> 02:10:26,600
And it didn't change much into the 80s, I'll tell you that, because that's what my-

2339
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:30,760
Yeah, the contraption itself really doesn't look that much different, honestly.

2340
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:34,880
I always wanted to call her my cousin, but in reality, she was my aunt who was a year

2341
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:43,440
older than me, thanks to my former stepdad marrying a younger woman and having a kid

2342
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:46,280
right before I was born.

2343
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:48,280
Families are weird, y'all.

2344
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:49,280
Yep.

2345
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,280
All right.

2346
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:52,480
Great pick for a not video game.

2347
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:58,400
But again, that's kind of the fun is it's like, honestly, it may not be a video game,

2348
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:04,160
but I think there's a lot of that creativity and putting things together and I'm certainly

2349
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:11,640
not surprised whatsoever to hear Loki, a Minecraft fan and a Sim build fan, a Lego fan, was also

2350
02:11:11,640 --> 02:11:12,640
a mousetrap fan.

2351
02:11:12,640 --> 02:11:17,040
I feel like that game was just a building block to all of that stuff.

2352
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:21,280
I want them to release like a super mousetrap where it's got even more-

2353
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:23,680
What, the safe on a car wasn't enough for you?

2354
02:11:23,680 --> 02:11:26,680
No, I mean like for a home version.

2355
02:11:26,680 --> 02:11:27,680
Okay.

2356
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:34,440
I mean, I do like the Rube Goldberg machines, the guy with the squirrels.

2357
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:36,280
Have you ever watched those videos?

2358
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,280
Not that one.

2359
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:40,000
I mean, I've seen the pictures and, you know.

2360
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,160
Well, it's not really a machine.

2361
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:46,120
It's just he creates this obstacle course for squirrels, but there's like little goals

2362
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:48,360
that happen at the end and it's pretty funny.

2363
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:49,880
Oh, Mark Rober.

2364
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:50,880
Yeah.

2365
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:51,880
All right.

2366
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:56,720
We're going to talk about some other quick headlines around the industry this week.

2367
02:11:56,720 --> 02:12:03,200
We're almost to the end of our scheduled stories tonight because we knew that the wrap ups

2368
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:06,480
would take a very long time at the top tonight, so we didn't schedule a lot of stories in

2369
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:10,600
this half of the show, but we want to touch on a few headlines real quick before we get

2370
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:16,120
to our listener roundtable via participate at orangelodgeradio.com, our email and our

2371
02:12:16,120 --> 02:12:20,320
Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2372
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,960
But first, Loki, some headlines.

2373
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:26,340
Yeah, there's been some updates to Nintendo Switch online.

2374
02:12:26,340 --> 02:12:31,800
So for June, we're going to be getting some brand new Super Nintendo and Nintendo games.

2375
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:39,760
Starting off with, of course, we have looks like Kirby's Tilt and Tumble and Blaster Master

2376
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:40,760
Enemy Below.

2377
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:47,280
Those are going to be new Game Boy titles and then Harvest Moon on the Super Nintendo

2378
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:51,640
and looks like Mystery Tower, which is going to be for the NES.

2379
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:56,640
I've never heard of Mystery Tower Harvest Moon is cool.

2380
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:57,920
For sure.

2381
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:04,220
And then more showcases coming out later this month, so in the very near future tomorrow,

2382
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:06,980
we have the Capcom Showcase 2023.

2383
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:11,580
It's going to be at 3 p.m. Pacific Time, 6 p.m. Eastern.

2384
02:13:11,580 --> 02:13:18,220
And they're going to have different announcements available there as well as Ubisoft Forward,

2385
02:13:18,220 --> 02:13:22,460
which is going to be also tomorrow as well, June 12th.

2386
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:30,860
And that is happening early in the morning at 945 Pacific Daylight Time and 645 Eastern

2387
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:31,860
Time.

2388
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:32,860
So.

2389
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:33,860
Cool.

2390
02:13:33,860 --> 02:13:40,140
Oh, I'm sorry, C.E.S.T., that's not Eastern Time, that would I don't know if that is Central

2391
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:41,140
Central.

2392
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:45,440
No, that's not something it's several hours later.

2393
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:48,900
So that's got to be European time or some C.E.S.T.

2394
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:51,740
Oh, I thought you said C.E.S.T.

2395
02:13:51,740 --> 02:13:54,860
No, not C.E.S.T., I know what C.E.S.T. means.

2396
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:58,940
Some of the games are going to be showing off in their avatar frontiers of Pandora.

2397
02:13:58,940 --> 02:14:03,740
Forgot that they're making an avatar game, Assassin's Creed Mirage, which I mean honestly

2398
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:06,940
when I saw the trailer for that, I thought it was Prince of Persia.

2399
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:13,280
The Crew Motorfest and an unannounced game, which I think is probably Star Wars since

2400
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,380
they already show that.

2401
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:16,860
So that would be Star Wars there.

2402
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:19,340
And then other things will be showing off later on.

2403
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:24,100
They're going to have a live stream that covers some more stuff from that.

2404
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:27,180
And C.E.S.T. is Central European Summer Time.

2405
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:32,380
It is seven hours ahead of Eastern, which would be 10 hours ahead of us.

2406
02:14:32,380 --> 02:14:34,460
On the West Coast.

2407
02:14:34,460 --> 02:14:35,460
The more you know.

2408
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:40,020
OK, Dark Sakura, how about some other you had some other WWDC stuff?

2409
02:14:40,020 --> 02:14:41,420
I think it was.

2410
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:42,420
I did.

2411
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:48,720
And it was really just the winners of the 2023 Apple Design Awards.

2412
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:52,420
And I'm only going to I'm not going to necessarily say what they were for, but I just wanted

2413
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:56,020
to mention the games in there that won.

2414
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:59,340
One of them is Stitched by Lykke Studios out of Thailand.

2415
02:14:59,340 --> 02:15:04,260
And that's actually pretty fun and very relaxing.

2416
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:15,180
There was also Afterplace, which is a pixel game by Evan Kies here in the US.

2417
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:21,380
There are crazy spiders on it, I'm just going to say.

2418
02:15:21,380 --> 02:15:26,260
Another game called Railbound, which no words, no points.

2419
02:15:26,260 --> 02:15:29,900
You just build tracks.

2420
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:33,420
Just a fun little puzzler.

2421
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:39,060
And then another one called Ending by Handy Games out of Germany, where you play as a

2422
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:43,380
fox trying to escape an environmental disaster.

2423
02:15:43,380 --> 02:15:47,420
It's very stray-like, but simpler.

2424
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:48,420
And then.

2425
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:52,340
I'm just seeing if there's any other games on here.

2426
02:15:52,340 --> 02:15:55,860
Resident Evil Village, of course, also won.

2427
02:15:55,860 --> 02:15:58,900
Marvel Snap also won.

2428
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:06,140
So that one actually got a design layout award.

2429
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:08,140
So there you go.

2430
02:16:08,140 --> 02:16:09,140
Nice.

2431
02:16:09,140 --> 02:16:10,140
All right.

2432
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:11,140
Well, for fans.

2433
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:12,140
Oh.

2434
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:15,900
Well, and I should point out that some of these games that won were not necessarily

2435
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:17,900
in singularly game categories.

2436
02:16:17,900 --> 02:16:19,900
These were all design.

2437
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:21,900
All right.

2438
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:26,460
So one game well-designed that I know a lot of you were really enjoying, but you don't

2439
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:30,100
have much longer to enjoy it on Game Pass, sadly, because it's going away this month.

2440
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:35,020
But for those of you that purchased Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge, you're

2441
02:16:35,020 --> 02:16:39,180
going to get some expanding DLC that comes out later in 2023.

2442
02:16:39,180 --> 02:16:44,260
Dimension Shellshock is the DLC that's coming, and they have already announced one of the

2443
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:51,160
big characters to this DLC is Usagi Miyamoto from Usagi Yojimbo fame, who is, of course,

2444
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:57,680
the rabbit that crossed over in some of the comics with the Ninja Turtles.

2445
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:01,680
That's kind of a cool little deep cut that they're bringing over into the game.

2446
02:17:01,680 --> 02:17:07,600
I used to totally read the Usagi Yojimbo comics back in the day, and he was in the cartoon,

2447
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:10,320
the 90s cartoon quite a bit.

2448
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:14,740
And as part of this DLC, since it is called Dimension Shellshock, this means there has

2449
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:20,280
to be some time-spanning portals that will bring Usagi to modern times, which means there

2450
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:23,960
are portals that take the modern times to ancient Japan.

2451
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:27,780
Hello, the third movie, Ninja Turtles movie.

2452
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:29,040
Maybe it'll be similar in plot.

2453
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,420
No, I don't know.

2454
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:32,640
There is going to be more other playable characters.

2455
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:36,760
Usagi is the only one confirmed as of now, but people are certainly guessing on what

2456
02:17:36,760 --> 02:17:38,080
the others could be.

2457
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:43,660
This DLC comes out later this year for the Switch, PS4 and 5, Windows PC, and Xbox One.

2458
02:17:43,660 --> 02:17:48,360
No price as of yet, but it will come later.

2459
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:50,320
So pretty cool.

2460
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:54,920
All right, that is our rapid fire news.

2461
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:59,680
So let's talk about what games are coming out this week, as if last week wasn't good

2462
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:00,680
enough for you.

2463
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:02,280
What's coming out this week?

2464
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:03,280
Loki will start in the US.

2465
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:05,440
Yeah, didn't you get enough games last week?

2466
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:09,200
I know, Street Fighter 6 and Diablo 4, you ought to be pretty busy.

2467
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:16,120
Yeah, we have a Front Mission 2 remake on Nintendo Switch.

2468
02:18:16,120 --> 02:18:22,160
We've got Doredogne, I don't know how to pronounce that.

2469
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:23,720
That's my best guess.

2470
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:28,640
That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

2471
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:37,760
Xbox Series, Blue Protocol on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Daydream Forgotten Sorrow

2472
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:48,120
on PC, Birdie Wing Golf Girls Story on Nintendo Switch, Crime Boss Rock-A-City on PlayStation

2473
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:55,880
5 and Xbox Series, the game sucks, don't buy it, Jack Gene on Nintendo Switch, Layers of

2474
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:03,760
Fear on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Steel Assault on PlayStation 4, PlayStation

2475
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:13,400
5, Xbox One and Xbox Series, Formula One 23 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

2476
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:19,640
One, Xbox Series, and last but not least, Park Beyond on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox

2477
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:20,640
Series.

2478
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:25,680
All right, looking in Japan at what releases are coming out over there.

2479
02:19:25,680 --> 02:19:31,080
On the Switch this week, we have Hakuyoki, Sweet School Life for the Nintendo Switch.

2480
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:37,440
It is in a regular and a limited edition or a special edition, and Kamisama Tokoi Gokoro

2481
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:43,120
is out this week as well on the Switch, and the House of the Dead remake is also out on

2482
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:44,920
the Switch this week.

2483
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:47,480
Those are the releases on the Nintendo Switch.

2484
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:54,320
On the PlayStation 5, Railway Empire 2 gets a deluxe edition release on the PlayStation

2485
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:55,320
5.

2486
02:19:55,320 --> 02:20:00,200
I think we have that here on Game Pass actually, but I know train sims are really fun in Japan,

2487
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,760
so there's that.

2488
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:06,120
And then the House of the Dead remake is also available on the PlayStation 5 this week as

2489
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:07,120
well.

2490
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:09,920
Dark Soccer, how about Europe?

2491
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:14,200
I actually have to say something that I bought earlier today after choosing the classic game.

2492
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:15,200
Okay.

2493
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:18,080
I bought a world's smallest mouse trap.

2494
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:19,640
Like a pocket version or something?

2495
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:22,080
Yeah, to go with my world's smallest scrabble.

2496
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:24,280
Oh, that's kind of cute.

2497
02:20:24,280 --> 02:20:25,800
These are a whole series of things.

2498
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:26,800
Oh, okay.

2499
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:28,680
Most of them work.

2500
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:35,320
I mean, clearly not the mean microscopic Polaroid camera, but I love them.

2501
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:36,880
There's even an operation.

2502
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:37,880
There's a few different ones.

2503
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:39,880
They're pretty cool.

2504
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:46,360
Anyway, as far as what's coming out on the 13th for PlayStation Xbox Switch, we have

2505
02:20:46,360 --> 02:20:48,800
Power Wash Simulator.

2506
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:53,800
On the 15th for PlayStation Switch, we have Galguardian's Demon Purge.

2507
02:20:53,800 --> 02:21:00,800
On the 16th for, and these both are PlayStation and Xbox, we have Park Beyond and F123.

2508
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:06,800
P.S., if someone wants to give me a McLaren F1, please do.

2509
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:08,800
I just want one.

2510
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:09,800
Please.

2511
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:10,800
Thank you.

2512
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,800
I'm sure one is on its way right now.

2513
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:13,800
All right.

2514
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:17,800
I've actually driven one around the box, around the block.

2515
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:18,800
Fine.

2516
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,800
It's your turn to have a say.

2517
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:22,800
If you want to send us an email, you can do that.

2518
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:24,800
Participate at orangesontraday.com.

2519
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:27,800
Sadly, I think we are email-less another week.

2520
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:29,800
I'll let Jamie confirm that.

2521
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:30,800
Mm-hmm.

2522
02:21:30,800 --> 02:21:31,800
Oh, no, no.

2523
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:32,800
We got one last second.

2524
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,800
Oh, we did.

2525
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:34,800
Okay.

2526
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:43,800
I think we should just have a voice clip of Cooney from Weird Al's UHF.

2527
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:44,800
Uh-huh.

2528
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:45,800
Nothing.

2529
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:47,800
Absolutely nothing.

2530
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:51,800
Hi, all.

2531
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:52,800
It's Mishi.

2532
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:54,800
I hope you're having a great weekend.

2533
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:56,800
Sorry in advance for spelling errors.

2534
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:57,800
It's okay.

2535
02:21:57,800 --> 02:21:58,800
It's more...

2536
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:03,800
Anyway, with that being said, my gaming week consisted of Diablo 4, Zelda, Tears of the

2537
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,800
Kingdom, which I finally got a new PC.

2538
02:22:05,800 --> 02:22:09,800
I ended up being able to play a game I was putting off simply because my old PC wouldn't

2539
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:10,800
run it.

2540
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,800
The game is called Sunhaven.

2541
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:15,800
It's your typical farming game, similar to Stardew Valley, with fantasy elements thrown

2542
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:18,800
in, like dragons, fae folk, and the like.

2543
02:22:18,800 --> 02:22:22,800
It's just a really cozy game if you want something relaxing to play.

2544
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:25,800
I'm slowly working on Diablo and Tears of the Kingdom as well.

2545
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:27,800
Once again, thanks for the show.

2546
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:28,800
Great job, guys.

2547
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,800
Happy gaming weekend stuffs.

2548
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:31,800
Sincerely, Mishi.

2549
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:33,800
Aw, thanks for the email, Mishi.

2550
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:34,800
Appreciate it.

2551
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,800
That Sunhaven sounds super cute.

2552
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,800
I'm all for Stardew Valley but with dragons and fairies.

2553
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:41,800
That's very much what we do.

2554
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:45,800
Those Stardew Valley games, there's a lot of copycat titles.

2555
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:50,800
I'm not using that negatively, but it's just, you know, sometimes when a game does very

2556
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:55,800
well you start to see some of the, you know, heavily inspired titles come out.

2557
02:22:55,800 --> 02:22:56,800
I hadn't heard that one.

2558
02:22:56,800 --> 02:23:01,800
That one wasn't on my radar, but I'm all for the cozy games, that's for sure.

2559
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:04,800
Okay, so talking in the roundtable.

2560
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,800
We have No One Special 77s in chat tonight.

2561
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:08,800
Hello, hello.

2562
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:14,800
Who says, who asks, I should say, is there any games coming out between now and quarter

2563
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:17,800
and 2024 that you're excited for?

2564
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:18,800
Oh, boy.

2565
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:21,800
That's a loaded question, to be honest.

2566
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:23,800
I mean, for me personally, I've made it no secret.

2567
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:26,800
I'm very excited for Final Fantasy XVI.

2568
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:31,800
And at the end of the year, I think Starfield I'm pretty hyped for at this point.

2569
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:35,800
I think there's enough there that I really am excited to see and want to check out.

2570
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:38,800
There's that as well.

2571
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:41,800
I feel like Nintendo will probably still announce something.

2572
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:45,800
We just don't know yet, but in the coming weeks, they'll announce a holiday game that

2573
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:48,800
I'm going to go, yep, I want to get that game.

2574
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:54,800
Speaking of Nintendo inspired games, that's Square Enix Splatoon knockoff with the foam.

2575
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:56,800
I can't remember the name of it now.

2576
02:23:56,800 --> 02:23:57,800
That looked cute.

2577
02:23:57,800 --> 02:24:00,800
And I might be interested in that if that makes this year, but I can't remember if it

2578
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:01,800
was this year.

2579
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:02,800
Oh, no.

2580
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,800
He said in the question, quarter one, 2024.

2581
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:08,800
So that means Final Fantasy VII Rebirth counts too, because that's supposed to be quarter

2582
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,800
one of next year.

2583
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:11,800
And I'm very hyped about that game as well.

2584
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:16,800
So I got a lot of great games to play throughout the year, and I still have a backlog.

2585
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:21,800
Like, you know, I have to admit for the first time in a long time, seeing that new Like

2586
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:25,800
a Dragon 8 trailer today, I was like, maybe I really do.

2587
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:28,800
Maybe Bobby Blackwell has a point when he says I need to go finish Like a Dragon.

2588
02:24:28,800 --> 02:24:31,800
Like maybe maybe I should go back and bubble that back up.

2589
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:33,800
But see, here's the problem.

2590
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:36,800
And Bobby's admitted this is a problem for him on his show, too.

2591
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:40,800
So now I'm going to have to start from the beginning, because I'm going to feel like

2592
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:44,800
I forgot everything that happened at this point and have to start from the beginning.

2593
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,800
I probably don't have to, but I feel like I have to.

2594
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:51,800
So there's just that growing backlog of games to get through.

2595
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:54,800
Oh, Bobby points out there's a theater mode, so I could just watch the cut scenes.

2596
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:55,800
All right.

2597
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:56,800
That's clever.

2598
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:57,800
That's clever.

2599
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:58,800
I was going to joke.

2600
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,800
I could watch a speed run.

2601
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:02,800
Let's see.

2602
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:03,800
Let's see.

2603
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:07,800
SJ100Matt says there's so many games coming out, but not enough time to play them.

2604
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:11,800
Need a room of spirit and time to get through some of these.

2605
02:25:11,800 --> 02:25:12,800
For serious.

2606
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:13,800
For serious.

2607
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,800
Oh, God.

2608
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:16,800
Now time in a bottle, though, is stuck in my head.

2609
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:20,800
Kind of a depressing little song.

2610
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:24,800
I'll give I'll give one more shout for our Discord green room if anyone wants to call.

2611
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:27,800
But otherwise, let me go to Loki and check in if there's a last minute story tonight.

2612
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:31,800
I feel like we hit on most things with the big announcements, but you never know.

2613
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:33,800
Yeah, we pretty much hit on most of those things.

2614
02:25:33,800 --> 02:25:38,800
I would say the only detail that we've got now is Starfield is going to run at 30 FPS

2615
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:42,800
locked on consoles, so they're not going to be doing any sort of performance mode.

2616
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:48,800
It's 4K on the Series X and 1440p on the Series S.

2617
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:51,800
I'm a little surprised to hear they're not trying to push 60 frames.

2618
02:25:51,800 --> 02:25:53,800
Yeah, at least on the console.

2619
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:56,800
Maybe PC, which is probably where I'll be playing it.

2620
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:59,800
So that's fine.

2621
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:00,800
Yeah.

2622
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:04,800
All right, we'll see what comes of that.

2623
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:05,800
All right.

2624
02:26:05,800 --> 02:26:09,800
Well, with that, I think we are not getting any other calls or anything tonight, which

2625
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:10,800
is fine.

2626
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:11,800
We're at about two and a half hours, which is normal length.

2627
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:14,800
So we're going to move to wrap it all up for tonight.

2628
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:18,800
But before we do, I'll just say thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch

2629
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:19,800
Radio.

2630
02:26:19,800 --> 02:26:21,800
Thank you for supporting independent podcasting.

2631
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:24,800
If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, please help us spread the word.

2632
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:26,800
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2633
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:31,800
A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way as well.

2634
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:35,800
I try to keep an eye on Spotify once in a while, too, for the people that actually respond

2635
02:26:35,800 --> 02:26:37,800
to the, what did you think of this week's show?

2636
02:26:37,800 --> 02:26:39,800
Because I saw one in the queue there that I pushed up.

2637
02:26:39,800 --> 02:26:44,800
So if you say nice things, I'll bump up whatever it is you put in there, too, as long as it's

2638
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,800
somewhat relevant.

2639
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:47,800
So thank you to all that.

2640
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:48,800
I really appreciate that.

2641
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:50,800
And those all go an awful long way.

2642
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:52,800
So thank you, thank you.

2643
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,800
I think that's all I have to say.

2644
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:55,800
We'll be back in seven days to do it again.

2645
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:58,800
We have some more announcements we're going to be getting at Ubisoft, Capcom, who knows

2646
02:26:58,800 --> 02:26:59,800
what else this week.

2647
02:26:59,800 --> 02:27:02,800
Maybe Nintendo will surprise us, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

2648
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:05,800
But in the meantime, lots of fun games to still be playing.

2649
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:10,800
Ooh, as I transition it to Dark Sakura, I know she has a new Dead by Daylight chapter

2650
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:11,800
to play on Tuesday.

2651
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:12,800
That's something exciting that's coming.

2652
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:13,800
I do.

2653
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:14,800
Yeah.

2654
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:21,800
And they've already had to do some tweaks to it, but I'm really looking forward to learning

2655
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:24,800
the singularity, unlocking.

2656
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:28,800
I mean, to be honest, I still don't have my night adept and I haven't played him yet,

2657
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:29,800
but I did.

2658
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:39,800
I did get both Wesker and Skull Merchant done in four games each.

2659
02:27:39,800 --> 02:27:45,800
I've seen people calling that new killer Larry because he's the singularity.

2660
02:27:45,800 --> 02:27:53,800
Actually, Larry is what Shayla calls one of the crows because he's Larry Bird.

2661
02:27:53,800 --> 02:27:54,800
Okay.

2662
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:57,800
But isn't there a streamer named Laurie Bird?

2663
02:27:57,800 --> 02:28:01,800
I think there is.

2664
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:03,800
She actually stopped.

2665
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:04,800
Lady Burb.

2666
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:06,800
She actually stopped streaming.

2667
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:08,800
Oh, I might be thinking of somebody else.

2668
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:11,800
But her husband is also Burb.

2669
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:12,800
Gotcha.

2670
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:15,800
And they call their kid Little Burb.

2671
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:16,800
Okay.

2672
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:19,800
And then what else am I going to say with that?

2673
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:20,800
Oh, the new survivor is very handsome.

2674
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:22,800
Very handsome fellow.

2675
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:24,800
Oh, Mr. Soma.

2676
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:31,800
And there are, from what I can see, I think Felix is getting another shirtless look, or

2677
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:33,800
at least open-shirted look.

2678
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:38,800
For Pride Month, it's what we deserve.

2679
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:43,800
I want an ace character that isn't Ace Visconti.

2680
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:48,800
Although, wouldn't that be kind of funny if it was Ace?

2681
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:51,800
Our other nickname is Ass Discount.

2682
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:54,800
I love the way that Alan plays Ace Visconti.

2683
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:57,800
Have you ever played with him on Dead by Daylight?

2684
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:00,800
His steam name is Ace Visconti, but gay.

2685
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:04,800
And he plays with purple velvet pants and a leopard shirt.

2686
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:10,800
It looks like a 70s stereotype of somebody who was in a John Waters movie once.

2687
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:13,800
I've seen him do his cosplay before, too.

2688
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:18,800
Now, my ace is really gross.

2689
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:29,800
He's kind of a lech old man who makes just enough money gambling to keep himself afloat,

2690
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:32,800
and he has a thing for college girls.

2691
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,800
Oh, boy.

2692
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:34,800
All right.

2693
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:36,800
Well, on that Dead by Daylight fandom note-

2694
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:38,800
We have weird headcanons in the game.

2695
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:43,800
On that Dead by Daylight fandom note, I know you're off to go play and stream, so any final

2696
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:46,800
thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2697
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:50,800
I may have open lobbies, and if I don't get anyone to play with me, we may go ahead and

2698
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:52,800
try another attempt tonight.

2699
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:53,800
All right.

2700
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:56,800
But you got to pay a lot for it to be nurse.

2701
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:57,800
All right.

2702
02:29:57,800 --> 02:29:59,800
Well, have a good stream tonight.

2703
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:05,800
I was going to say you, too, but probably you're going to Diablo, so bye.

2704
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:06,800
Bye.

2705
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:08,800
Have a good night.

2706
02:30:08,800 --> 02:30:10,800
That was a very safe bet she made there.

2707
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:11,800
All right.

2708
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:15,800
Actually, I have some 14 errors to catch up on, too, so it might end up being that.

2709
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:16,800
All right.

2710
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:18,800
Loki, what's your final thought for us tonight?

2711
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:22,800
I'm excited to go see Randy Feltface tomorrow.

2712
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:23,800
Who the hell is that?

2713
02:30:23,800 --> 02:30:24,800
I've never heard that.

2714
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:27,800
He is an Australian puppet comic.

2715
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:28,800
Oh, okay.

2716
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:29,800
And it's not like-

2717
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:31,800
Everything's funnier with puppets.

2718
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:33,800
Well, he is a puppet.

2719
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:34,800
His character is a puppet.

2720
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:39,800
You don't know who actually is voicing him, but he is hilarious, and I can't wait to see him.

2721
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:40,800
All right.

2722
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:41,800
Good times.

2723
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:42,800
Have fun at that.

2724
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:43,800
My final thought.

2725
02:30:43,800 --> 02:30:45,800
Final Fantasy XVI demo tomorrow.

2726
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:46,800
Yes, I'll be streaming.

2727
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:50,800
I know I've been really bad at streaming, but man, being sick knocked me on my ass for

2728
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:56,800
two weeks, so strep throat, it happens, and then another something on top of that.

2729
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:57,800
I'm excited to get back into streaming.

2730
02:30:57,800 --> 02:30:58,800
I'm really excited.

2731
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:01,800
I get to play Final Fantasy XVI tomorrow.

2732
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:02,800
I'm so excited.

2733
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:03,800
That's it.

2734
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:04,800
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

2735
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:09,800
We'll be back in seven days to talk about XVI, whatever other games, Capcom, Ubisoft,

2736
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:11,800
everybody else is set to announce.

2737
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:13,800
It's an exciting time in gaming.

2738
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:18,800
I hope you all have fun playing games, whether you're playing Diablo IV, Street Fighter VI,

2739
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:22,800
or something in your backlog from years ago, whatever it is, or you're just playing Minecraft

2740
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:29,800
again like Loki, whatever it is you're playing, have fun, enjoy it, and please be nice to

2741
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:33,800
people online, and stop making stupid people famous.

2742
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:35,800
Good night, everybody.

2743
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:40,800
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2744
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:45,800
