27120	29200	60% of all statistics were made up on the spot.
29240	32720	Now it's time for your birthday hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki as you've come
32720	36040	to enjoy to tell you about this week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
36040	37240	every gamer has a voice.
38960	41920	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41920	50440	Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice
50920	53480	21 years and counting.
53480	59400	Hello, hello, and hello to all those of you that are participating with our show live over
59400	62280	at Twitch.tv, Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
62280	66360	Thank you so much. I see the love coming in as the show is starting and all the birthday
66360	67600	wishes. Thank you all so much.
67600	68640	It does mean the world.
69520	71400	Let me quickly go around and introduce everybody.
71400	75000	Of course, I am Rob Roberts, and I've been here every week, just about.
75000	78880	I mean, give or take some holiday weeks and vacation weeks because people are like, it
78880	83440	doesn't math up. If you do 50 weeks a year, shouldn't you be past episode 1000 by now?
83480	89520	Well, we do more like 45 episodes a year, which is still more than any Netflix show is
89520	90760	going to get, that's for sure.
91040	92880	But it doesn't math up.
93120	94560	Yeah, I just said it doesn't math up.
94760	96080	So anyway.
96200	98000	Hi, I'm Rob Roberts.
98000	102160	And joining me to correct my grammar is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
102680	104080	Well, I do it to everybody.
104080	105200	It's equal opportunity.
105200	106520	Fair, fair.
106520	107400	How are you tonight?
108120	111360	Um, it's been a week.
112360	113200	Just a week?
114080	120840	Well, a friend of mine at work that I hadn't seen since before the pandemic died last year
120840	127960	while I was on leave and found out another of my favorite people at work is at home dying
127960	129160	right now from cancer.
130120	133600	So, yeah, it's been a little emotional.
134120	135000	I'm sorry to hear that.
135720	136400	Thank you.
136400	137000	Thank you.
137080	141520	Um, but which was, which was funny.
141520	145680	I was watching like something about aging right before I went into work and found out.
145680	150840	So guys, it's, it's been a week, a week.
151240	151760	Yeah.
152320	154120	You know, you know, I'm resilient.
154640	155120	Yeah.
155120	158840	Turning, you know, in turning 21, not to like totally bring down the mood at the start of
158840	162960	the show, but certainly when you've been doing a show, as long as this, when you're 21 years,
163200	167800	you know, we've had people, you know, you guys that show up here Sunday nights, you're
167800	171840	the extended family of orange lounge rate, or you are the family of orange launch radio.
171840	174200	Now you're basically extended family to us as hosts.
174640	178080	And, uh, you know, we've, we've lost some listeners over the years, like, you know, in,
178080	182320	in somewhat recent memory, a fat ninja DM used to be here, uh, on Sunday nights chatting
182320	182640	with us.
182640	186200	And, you know, we lost him, um, probably about a year, a year and a half ago at this point.
186400	188760	Uh, although it's very hard for me to time these days.
189080	191560	Um, you know, there's been, there's been other folks over the years as well.
191560	196120	So it's always, you know, one of those things where it's like, Oh, uh, those, those reminders
196120	200760	of, um, every day being a gift are, uh, certainly all around us.
200800	205960	So, um, we're, we're thankful that we've been able to be here for 21 years.
206040	206960	That's for sure.
207120	208320	Uh, we've had our health.
208840	211160	There's been ups and downs for sure.
211480	214280	Um, but we've had the ability to be here for 21 years.
214280	215920	And so for that, we're thankful for sure.
215920	221920	Um, um, let me also say hello to and welcome tech master.
221920	222600	Loki.
223120	223520	Hello.
223600	224400	Hi, how are you?
225040	225560	I'm good.
225640	226520	Yeah, I'm full.
226760	227120	What's that?
227120	233600	I ate a bunch of, I'm full because my wife bought, um, like a sashimi grade tuna.
234400	236200	Like, I was like 14.
236280	236720	I don't know.
236720	241520	It was like a thing that was like, it's pretty large and ate all of it with rice.
244000	245440	I was going to go back healthy.
245960	251520	It sounds like you made a poke bowl, but like a Loki poke bowl, which all it needed was bacon.
251520	258600	I like poke bowls and like, and I almost got poke bowl today, but like I didn't because I have tuna at home.
258600	261640	So what we call poke here is not actually poke.
262520	263360	Well, you know what?
263400	269080	I mean, that I know it's missing all of the pocket monsters, but you know what, sushi's close enough, so it's fine.
269160	270560	Or tuna in this case.
271560	279040	I mean, just sounds like you, like, I mean, tuna is really, I mean, fish in general is really good for your joints.
279800	280800	So, yeah.
281920	291800	Um, so tonight we are taking a look back at 21 years of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it or not, uh, officially as of June 23rd, which was a couple of days ago.
292160	295320	Uh, that was our very first broadcast back in 2002.
295920	301400	Um, and for those that, you know, are new around here, cause we do get new faces, uh, every week, we're thankful for that.
301720	311360	Um, we started because all three of us met as we were playing, um, Dance Dance Revolution would probably be the most notable Bahmani game, which was a series of music-based.
311360	314240	Well, I shouldn't say was cause technically Bahmani games are still going.
314520	324280	There was a lull for a while, but, um, uh, Bahmani games are music-based games, uh, by Konami, uh, who has gone through their own series of changes over the years.
324280	326520	But regardless, we all met playing DDR at the arcade.
327000	330640	And after we would meet up at Roseville Gothland on, what was it?
330640	342800	Tuesday nights, Thursday nights, one of them, we would go from there and we would go to the little cafe that was in the parking lot and we would, uh, just chow down on mozzarella sticks and soup, whatever else they had.
342840	352160	And, uh, just talk about life tangents and a lot of video games and what was happening, not just in the DDR community, but in the rest of the gaming world.
352160	357320	And so, um, on RIP, the mini loaves at, uh, the restaurant.
357320	358280	Oh man, those are the best.
358280	359720	They don't do mini loaves anymore, huh?
360080	360480	No.
360680	362200	Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap.
362200	369760	But anyway, um, yeah, uh, you know, we would, we would, uh, uh, eat and, you know, talk and just be there.
369760	381920	So we kind of took that atmosphere and brought it to this virtual environment, you know, that we, you see now and, um, you know, especially since pandemic lockdowns happened, really taking that concept of a virtual table.
382200	386280	And, um, you know, uh, inviting all of you to be here with us.
386280	396600	So, uh, I really, really appreciate, uh, those of you that have turned out, whether it's the first episode or the, um, 965th episode that you're listening to of orange launch radio.
396600	398800	Thank you so much for being here and just being a part of it.
399160	400480	Uh, really appreciate it.
400880	410200	And, um, I also wanted to say a big kudos, uh, that that intro tonight from Jason was very impressive with all the statistics.
410520	414920	Um, I'm assuming some of that had to come off the Wiki or really good memory.
414920	418560	Cause there was stuff in there where I was like, I don't even remember how many of those we've had.
418960	421960	Uh, so that's, that's really, um, really impressive.
421960	435200	And also I just want to take a moment to acknowledge Jason as well, who has been instrumental for this program behind the scenes, um, over the years with our voiceovers, um, the hosting and, you know, keep, keeping the, the wheels turn in and all that stuff.
435200	439760	So just a big kudos to Jason for helping this be afloat for 21 years.
439760	442600	I know you haven't heard him regularly on this show in a while.
442920	447600	He used to come in the studio for a while when it made more, when it clicked more for his personal life to be able to do that.
447600	450640	But, um, just, you know, want to give that big, thank you as well.
450640	463600	I also want to give, um, I'm sure there's a lot of people we could thank and I'm going to forget people, but I also want to give a shout out to Bobby black Wolf because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby black will show.
463840	468440	And Bobby for years and years has joked that he's the opening act to orange launch radio.
468600	479960	I think he knows we don't really see it that way, but, um, we are happy to share the stage with Bobby every week, pretty much for what, like 18 of those 21 years.
480320	487280	Um, so, and maybe not quite that long, but almost, it really feels like that it's been a long, long time, uh, sharing the stage with Bobby.
487280	488040	So we appreciate that.
488040	497960	Bobby is also, you know, there was a time when this show almost ended after four years when life 365, uh, kind of.
498480	511000	Fucked her, I guess life is five is back, but this is the old life is five when you could like run your own network on there and you know, some internet rate things went through and the rates are going to go through the roof and we weren't really going to be able to afford to keep our own station running anymore.
511080	512640	Cause orange radio was not just a show.
512640	527320	It was a station, uh, back in the beginning and, uh, we didn't think we were going to be able to run it anymore, but Bobby was really the one that kind of connected us with, um, all games radio who at the time then became our home network for quite some time.
527360	532920	Um, before then, of course the voice of geeks network about, uh, God, 11 years ago at this point.
532920	535680	So, um, thank you to Bobby.
535680	539680	Who's made, made sure we've always had a stage to do this on.
539960	540720	That's for sure.
540720	543080	So, uh, yeah, and dark to see you talking about life.
543080	544800	365 says they came back, huh?
544800	545080	Yeah.
545080	549640	I remember doing, cause I was like, do they charge you to broadcast on there now?
549680	550040	Yeah.
550040	553040	I think somebody, uh, somebody new bought it.
553040	555760	Like it's changed hands as a lot of websites do.
555760	562160	And I think, I think it tries to be a broadcast in a box type of thing, but it's, you know, here we are on Twitch.
562160	569400	Twitch is the mechanism that we can record the podcast, which this has always been an audio show from the very beginning.
569400	571040	So yes, video is here.
571040	575720	We're happy to see you on Twitch and all that stuff, but it's, it's really an audio show.
575720	582600	This was inspired not by other podcasts because I mean, I'm not trying to sound egotistical.
582600	590000	It's just the fact when there was nobody else out there that when we, when we started doing this type of thing, there were other broadcasters.
590000	591720	There was nothing like what you see today.
591720	592720	That was the medium.
593040	602440	We were influenced by more traditional radio shows and like the three hour programs you might see on Sirius XM or on broadcast radio.
602440	604360	That's where the roots of our show is.
604800	612760	Not like a 30 minute, one hour package, um, you know, that you might see in more traditional, you know, types of formats.
612760	617360	And that's why the show has continued to run essentially as long as we feel it needs to.
618240	623400	I don't know if there's a lot of shows out there that run beyond an hour on a regular basis.
623400	629160	There's some, I'm sure there are, but, um, you know, just, we've been doing it our way and that's how we've made it for 21 years.
629480	631200	So, uh, I'm rambling.
631200	633920	I tend to do that, but I want to take a minute to acknowledge.
633920	644640	Does anybody else, uh, want to, um, oh, one other shout out I should give, actually, I know I'm going to forget people and I'm sorry about that because I didn't plan this out in advance, but I want to make sure I also shout out Travis Donovan.
645040	646960	I know he's not here and he's doing his old thing.
646960	658320	He's being a crabby old man yelling at a cloud, but, and we love him for it, but you know, he was the one that showed me and dark soccer to an extent that literally any idiot can podcast.
658320	668560	And I mean that in the nicest possible way, but you know, I went to college thinking I would want to get into radio and I might want to be actually, then it was TV, a weatherman to do all this stuff.
668800	675120	And then when I actually interned in the industry, uh, I learned that I don't want to, I don't want to do this.
675120	681600	I don't have the fight to, um, I was, I'm just going to be very blunt.
681600	683400	I don't want to blow my way to the top.
683600	701320	Uh, and this industry is very competitive and this, this whole thing, I don't, I don't, I don't think it's for me, but Travis showed me very early on that with a gorilla radio type of setup in your spare bedroom and an internet connection, you can create radio on your own terms.
701680	706800	And that's the path that, you know, we've been forging here at orange launch radio.
706800	710520	And many of you out there that are content creators have been forging ever since.
710880	713480	And it's a, it's a, it's a wonderful, wonderful thing.
713880	721080	So I learned that watching pump up the volume later, that movie was obviously a huge influence as well, but that was a movie.
721080	721400	Right.
721400	727120	And to see it in real life was like, Oh, I don't have to break the law to do this type of thing.
727120	729480	I'd like to, I'd like to thank Christian Slater.
729680	733600	And, uh, what was her name that played the eat me, beat me lady?
733960	735920	Oh, I don't, I don't.
735920	736880	Somebody in chattel side.
736880	739640	I remember who you're talking about, but yeah, I don't remember the actress's name.
740680	743800	Um, it's almost there, but now I'm just, I'm, I'm kidding.
743800	744520	I think Bobby.
745080	751360	Um, so as to show 100, Matt and chat says, if Travis were here, he'd say, I made you, but I'm too old and going to take a nap.
751480	752840	That sounds, that sounds about right.
752840	754440	That's the very time I think of Travis.
754440	757240	I think of him with a bra on his head saying he's queen on the dollar.
758240	760000	It's not just him saying he's queen on the dollar.
760160	763360	He would put the bra on his head and go, I'm queen on the dollar.
764280	764480	Yeah.
764480	765520	This whole thing he would do.
765600	774760	I got to wonder though, is he going to, you know, with the new starfield coming out and stuff, he's going to switch up his cosplay to do some of that instead of all the mass effects stuff.
774760	777320	Or you think he's going to stick with that going forward?
777560	778520	Uh, I don't know.
778520	780760	Cause he doesn't, he doesn't really go to dragon con anymore.
780760	785560	He made a surprise appearance a couple of years ago, but, um, he hasn't been since, Oh, S.
785560	788200	Jonah to Matt says, Samantha Mathis is who you're looking for.
788200	788560	Jamie.
788880	793600	Didn't she play the original princess peach or Daisy, whoever it was in the original Mario movie.
793600	796000	Wasn't that also her in the nineties, Mario movie?
796080	796760	I'm almost positive.
796760	799600	It was, that would be assuming I actually watched that.
800000	802320	Yeah, no, it was interesting connection.
802320	805000	So pump up the volume does connect to video games in many ways.
805480	807080	Um, Rama confirms.
807080	807560	Yes.
807960	810280	And I also want to ignore, uh, acknowledge this.
810560	814120	Um, uh, some of you in chat are saying some very nice things.
814120	818960	Pod culture says, uh, Rob, y'all were the biggest influence on our show.
819320	824240	Um, and, uh, fixie high fixation, gays fixie and chat says ramble away.
824240	825840	This is you guys big day.
826080	826600	Yes.
826600	832040	Um, as Joe and Hunter, Matt pointing out, there were always some webcams, the 56 K cam of the guest couch.
832040	832400	Yes.
832400	834480	There was a webcam in the early days of the show.
834640	839560	It would refresh once every 30 seconds as webcams did back then, but there was a cam.
839600	840320	It did work.
840600	842400	So just in TV, y'all.
842480	844600	Yeah, we were on Justin TV.
844600	845200	Yes, we were.
845440	849040	So there actually still is an orange lounge radio Twitch channel.
849280	850760	It just collects cobwebs.
850760	853680	It is our old Justin channel and there's some old content still there.
853680	854720	If you want to go seek it out.
854720	855360	I mean, have fun.
855360	856640	It's some old shit, but it's there.
857200	861040	Um, you might even find clips of when we were in the garage studio.
861400	862560	So, well, shit.
862560	864280	Now that I've gone down this rabbit hole.
865480	867800	Was it orange lounge or was it orange lounge radio?
867800	868560	I'm trying to look it up.
869640	873120	Oh, some fucker grabbed the name orange lounge.
874200	875920	That's not, that's probably not orange lounge.
875920	876440	I don't think.
876440	879360	No, it's just, it's probably like a fan or something.
879520	879880	Okay.
879880	887600	I found our channel, but unfortunately all I see are clips of the final fantasy 13 demo being played.
887920	888600	Lord.
888800	892560	Um, I don't know if we have any clips from in the studio.
892560	893360	Oh, I see.
894360	895600	I see some things.
895640	897960	Well, the audio would have been from the podcast.
897960	901160	It's just the video was the 13 demo.
901200	902280	Wait, hold on, hold on.
902320	902680	Okay.
902720	903440	Oh, this is great.
903440	903880	This is great.
903880	904240	Hold on.
904240	910000	So somebody clip this, this clip is 15 years ago.
910840	911280	Hold on.
911280	912640	I'm going to put this on the other screen.
912680	913840	15 years ago.
913840	916280	This clip is from check this out.
917320	919160	Uh, if you want to give us a call.
920160	921120	I remember this.
921120	924480	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
924480	924920	Who's this?
927240	931040	Oh, wait, who's this?
931960	933320	And there's intern drew.
933360	933640	Yeah.
933640	934400	You can see there.
934400	940600	Loki is wearing a little big planet costume with the OLR logo intern drew's in the back there.
940600	944760	And I believe that's Bradley Arcadian 42 in the back.
944800	961280	And then dark soccer used to sit on a couch that was over on the right side because she didn't want to be on cam, which, you know, if you've ever paid attention to what happens to women on the internet, sometimes I understand our soccer's perspective at that time and not wanting to be on cam.
962880	966200	There's some really wild stuff here in the background to like all this stuff.
966200	967600	This is like a dear friends poster.
967600	969480	I want to say this is signed in the back.
969640	970480	You know, it's funny.
970520	971440	All the decor in the garage.
971480	972040	What's that?
972720	980240	Drew's picture on my phone is him with the long floppy hair, which of course he doesn't have now.
980240	983880	But I always like I'm so entertained to show co workers.
984480	985360	We worked together.
987560	988160	Look at that.
988160	993440	I'm like, don't don't, you know, he thankfully he grew out of his young republican phase.
993680	994720	Yeah, yeah.
995520	996480	Oh, no.
996480	996880	Oh, no.
996880	998560	Okay, I'm going to do one more one more.
998560	1000240	Oh, God, I could fall down a rabbit hole here.
1000240	1001760	There's a lot of clips on here.
1001760	1002840	Holy shit.
1004040	1004560	Oh, my God.
1004560	1006280	Okay, I got to do one more of these.
1006280	1009560	This is this one is labeled.
1010960	1012240	Caramel dancing.
1013000	1013800	Oh, Lord.
1014280	1016360	And I have to see what's going on in this clip here.
1016360	1017080	Hold on, hold on.
1018080	1020400	Is that Rama in the studio with us?
1021760	1023000	Holy shit, it is.
1023000	1024920	This is when Rama was here.
1030840	1031560	Yes.
1034560	1035680	Oh, oh, shit.
1035680	1036520	I'm not on another screen.
1036520	1036960	I'm sorry.
1041040	1042360	And that started to you with us.
1042360	1049800	There are two in the back and drew with the hair and me face palming during this song.
1050600	1053200	Don't they dance at some point?
1053560	1054400	I'm skipping ahead.
1055440	1057640	No, I guess this is just our reaction to the song.
1057640	1058240	I don't know.
1058360	1061160	That's that's another very, very old clip.
1061320	1066880	I did not know this much shit was archived over on the old Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channel.
1067240	1069720	You have to dig a little bit to find it, but it's there.
1069840	1073040	That's and I know how to and I know how to download every little piece of it.
1073360	1077920	You might you might think you might need to send me where was the link again?
1077920	1081000	It's the it's just Twitch TV, Orange Lounge Radio.
1081000	1087400	And then you have to actually go into the full videos page and the videos page has everything.
1087560	1089120	It's not in the main page.
1089680	1091120	I can get it all downloaded.
1091280	1093040	Yeah, that might be a fun thing to put together.
1093080	1094960	Let's hear it for developer mode.
1095040	1095520	Yeah.
1095520	1095960	Wowee.
1095960	1096320	Wow.
1096320	1097840	What a good trip down memory lane.
1097840	1098200	My God.
1098200	1100480	Episode 270 post show.
1101640	1104760	It looks like the cameras pointed at the TV or something.
1104760	1107040	I don't remember how we were doing it at the time.
1107480	1108520	Oh, my goodness.
1109080	1109440	All right.
1109440	1110000	I'll see.
1110440	1111120	Oh, there we go.
1111160	1112600	Excite truck deathmatch.
1114760	1115280	All right.
1115360	1117400	Oh, I'll I'll grab some.
1118560	1121160	Yeah, dark disease, as I wonder if there's a way to save those clips.
1121160	1121760	Yeah, that's what Jamie.
1121760	1122920	Yeah, there absolutely is.
1122960	1123320	Yeah.
1123400	1132240	So if you are in if you have developer mode enabled in Safari, you can right click on a video and inspect element.
1132240	1134040	You just have to know how to read the code to find it.
1134280	1134720	Wow.
1134760	1135400	That's awesome.
1136080	1136400	Yeah.
1136880	1138200	Fun trip down memory lane.
1138200	1141240	So that's that's why I knew we had a YouTube channel with some old clips, too.
1141240	1152560	But that was that I forgot that we actually have basically a Justin TV channel that got turned into a Twitch channel that has really, really old clips of us doing this thing 15 years ago and probably more.
1152560	1154080	That's appreciation.
1154120	1154600	Wild.
1155000	1157560	So yeah, I was looking at some of those videos.
1157560	1160000	There's a lot of wacky stuff in there, but I love it.
1160040	1160520	I love it.
1161320	1161600	All right.
1161600	1169480	Well, again, thanks from all of us to you all who come out here and listen every week and just have made this show happen.
1169480	1173560	So, you know, our next big milestone will be episode 1000.
1173600	1184360	Believe it or not, we're not the first gaming podcast to hit 1000 episodes, but we're the first weekly show one show a week to hit it.
1185040	1189360	And honestly, in almost any medium I can think of.
1190640	1197120	I mean, there's some there's others like, you know, there's some shows that have been running like that, like The Simpsons has been running since the dawn of time, right?
1197120	1198520	But even The Simpsons only does like 20 up.
1198560	1200600	No, we have more episodes of them.
1200640	1201000	Yeah.
1201000	1212880	Well, and if you think if you think about traditional radio things like what's Art Bell show called, but a new guy has run it for years coast to coast, you know, things like that have been running for years and years and years and years, right?
1212880	1214520	So they're always going to have more episodes than us.
1214920	1219840	But you know, as far as like internet medium things, there's not like for video games.
1220840	1226680	They're there, we know we're the oldest that that has done this consistently for this long.
1227000	1228880	We're the oldest I mean, period.
1228880	1229960	That's it for video games.
1230240	1231640	For other mediums.
1231720	1235480	I'm sure it's, there's probably some tech related shows that have been going about us.
1235560	1237800	But it's a small circle at this point.
1238160	1240600	So, um, and big kudos.
1240600	1241920	I might not be able to download these.
1242480	1243680	Oh, no, really?
1244600	1249760	Yeah, they're saying it can't load the the video file off of here.
1249760	1250680	It's gotta be there, though.
1250720	1251640	Yeah, I'll figure it out.
1251720	1252360	I'll get it done.
1252600	1254520	If you can play it, you can download it.
1254560	1262720	So yeah, but um, yeah, I just want to say, you know, again, not just thanks to all of you, but also, you know, Dark Sakura Loki.
1263600	1266680	It's our dedication that's had made this happen for 21 years.
1266680	1270680	So thank you all for you know, being committed to this as long as y'all have as well.
1270680	1272560	So it's, um,
1272960	1273880	what else is he gonna do?
1273880	1274280	I know.
1275520	1276840	Things hit a hit things.
1276880	1280040	Things hit that point at some point where it's like, what else am I gonna do Sunday night?
1283080	1283600	All right.
1283760	1289200	You know, you know, this has been a very positive part of my life.
1289200	1290920	You Dan's a podcaster now.
1291520	1292960	Yeah, he does the pinball stuff, right?
1293480	1294880	The spinner is lit.
1294920	1295400	Mm hmm.
1297600	1299800	So, yeah, it's, uh, yeah.
1299800	1307680	And Alan had a short lived Warcraft podcast for like six episodes, but I always, you know, he gets into streaming, which is pretty cool.
1307680	1309320	So now we just need Mrs.
1309320	1312120	Loki to have a rant podcast of her own.
1312800	1315040	I think she'd be good at it if she wanted to do it.
1316120	1320560	The only thing she's watching now that she'd rant on is the Beverly Hills Housewives.
1320560	1322120	I was gonna say it has to be Housewives.
1323000	1327120	Which I have watched way too many episodes of already.
1327160	1330880	Like, I am not happy that I've seen that many episodes.
1331440	1334120	I would love a Housewives recap podcast for Mrs.
1334120	1336160	Loki, but it's it's all good.
1336480	1338160	She can she can enjoy it in peace.
1338720	1347640	Just imagine like living or like being friends with people that bring up like you said something mean to me like two years ago and I still remember it.
1347640	1348920	And I'm waiting for that apology.
1348920	1350040	And like, that's the show.
1350320	1352360	It's just like super annoying.
1352760	1353040	Yeah.
1354360	1354920	All right.
1356840	1358600	Let's see, comments in chat.
1358600	1368360	No one special and 777 says, So when our hits 1000, will we get Rob singing a Madonna voiceover or going full diva and sashaying away?
1368360	1370800	I already went full diva once on this program.
1370800	1372120	So be careful what you wish for.
1375520	1376200	I don't know.
1376680	1378440	The honest answer is I don't know.
1378480	1383480	Like you, you hit so many milestones, you're not sure how to tell them all apart at one point.
1383480	1386760	So, you know, we want to still acknowledge and say thank you.
1386760	1389480	But, you know, I don't know what we'll do.
1389480	1391960	Like you start paving things with your milestones.
1392000	1393080	Yeah, yeah.
1394040	1402280	Such as the background of Street Fighter six that Loki has running there and all the Capcom game milestones you see on the sidewalk there in the background in that earlier scene.
1402280	1405240	I think it moved into a fighting match, but I caught that in the earlier scene.
1405720	1411880	I was just hoping there'd be some hot player on refrigerator action, but we haven't seen it yet.
1411880	1412440	Not yet.
1412440	1414840	So by the way, I have a theory about this.
1414840	1420520	And I think that these are really low res, not just because of how we shot them.
1421160	1423960	I think they were just leftover placeholder.
1426040	1431000	Because, yeah, I can't I can't get it to load up the original clip from the link.
1431000	1431800	Oh, wow.
1431800	1436600	I mean, and they're also like copies of copies from Lord knows how long ago that have been.
1437560	1442920	If I can get logged into the account and go into the video manager, then I can get them that way.
1444760	1445880	I would bet.
1445880	1449000	Well, I don't want to talk about the password, but I'll text you.
1449000	1449720	I'll text you.
1449720	1451640	So I gotta I gotta watch my mouth on air.
1451640	1454360	But I have guesses.
1454360	1456840	Well, and if nothing else, we can probably reset it.
1458840	1459400	Probably.
1459400	1460440	Except the account.
1460440	1464600	Even if the email account doesn't exist anymore, we can create it and then reset it and then
1464600	1465320	delete it again.
1465320	1469960	Because it probably it probably honestly goes to mailbag at orange on trader.com.
1469960	1471000	But we'll figure it out.
1471000	1473960	It could go to my personal email to at orange on radio.
1473960	1474460	So we'll see.
1475080	1475560	Yeah.
1475560	1479800	Anyway, um, let's get into some actual gaming news.
1479800	1480600	That's what we do here.
1480600	1482280	We talk about what's going on in the gaming industry.
1482280	1486920	And there's actually continued to be quite a bit this week because it was rumored that
1486920	1487880	it was going to happen.
1487880	1493400	And then sure enough, Nintendo decided to show up to the not E3 party as well and drop
1493400	1494520	some bombshells of their own.
1494520	1497160	So we have a Nintendo Direct to talk about from this week.
1498120	1501400	Loki, would you mind walking us through some of the headlines from the Nintendo Direct?
1501960	1502440	Yeah.
1502440	1510920	So they started off with showing off some new Pokemon DLC for Violet and Scarlet, including
1510920	1512280	Area Zero.
1514280	1515560	So that looked cool.
1515560	1519480	I don't know, not playing the game, but we knew they were going to be putting out more
1519480	1520360	DLC for that.
1520360	1521560	So of course, it makes sense.
1522760	1528200	They had another trailer for Sonic Superstars, which is coming out like I think this week.
1528200	1531640	So it's, you know, of course, on the switch as well.
1532520	1533480	So looks cool.
1533480	1535400	Trying to get my kid to play it.
1535400	1536600	But now I don't know if he's going to.
1536600	1540200	Paulie was another one.
1540200	1543240	It's a free to play game, kind of a survival.
1545480	1548280	I was like town building, but yeah, it looked pretty cool.
1548280	1550200	And that's going to be coming to the switch as well.
1550840	1558680	Persona 5 Tactica was going to be coming out November 17th and it looked pretty sweet.
1559640	1566360	This is a neat take on a game, but Myth Force, which is structured.
1566360	1568920	It's supposed to be like a Saturday morning cartoon.
1569560	1573720	And I mean, the logo itself kind of reminds me a little bit like Thundercats almost, but
1575400	1579480	it is supposed to be coming to the switch later this year as well.
1579480	1582840	And we got some more news about Splatoon 3 Splatfest.
1582840	1587720	They're going to be doing a toss up between different desserts.
1587720	1590040	So it looks like frozen yogurt, ice cream.
1590040	1595080	And I don't know if it's like frozen yogurt as well or maybe I don't know.
1595080	1596280	Mint chocolate chip or something.
1596280	1598040	But here's the funny thing about that.
1598040	1602600	Why wouldn't you'll notice they didn't do chocolate, probably because they didn't want
1602600	1604760	it look to look like you were flinging poop everywhere.
1604760	1609880	So they decided to purposely pick something besides just chocolate so that it could be
1609880	1615240	a better color than brown because the means that would come from brown brown splat, they
1615240	1618920	just and that's the same reason you're not going to see a yellow or is there a yellow?
1618920	1620040	I don't think there is a yellow.
1620040	1621000	He had a medical term.
1621640	1627080	I probably the vanilla is kind of yellowy.
1627080	1628040	I don't know.
1628040	1628520	I don't know.
1628520	1632680	Well, I'm sure there's probably like a fluorescent yellow, but not like, you know, it's like
1633320	1635160	well, it's it's.
1637240	1644600	It is it is a like a don't just take the train and derail it immediately.
1644600	1645720	Here's the thing.
1645720	1647160	Here's the thing with the Splatfest.
1648440	1650840	Why the hell was that in the Nintendo Direct?
1650840	1656920	Like what a fucking buzzkill that was like the Nintendo Directs have consistently been
1656920	1658360	botching Splatoon news.
1658360	1659560	Like, I'm just going to say it.
1659560	1664520	Yeah, the Splatoon stuff in the last direct was also like not great.
1664520	1666680	And like a Splatfest.
1666680	1667800	Who cares?
1667800	1668040	Sorry.
1668040	1670120	I mean, I'm sorry to Splatoon fans.
1670120	1675720	Of course you care, but it doesn't need to be like, are they thinking like, oh, oh, fuck,
1675720	1679160	I got to get Splatoon three because I got to fight about ice cream.
1679640	1681640	Who was this supposed to win over?
1681640	1685000	Like, I just I it was a weird thing to have in the direct.
1685000	1686760	It was a waste of time in the direct.
1686760	1688840	It was a waste of ice cream, though.
1688840	1689340	Yeah.
1690200	1691800	And it does not look like ice cream.
1691800	1692520	I'm just saying that.
1693320	1697960	So they may have missed with they may have avoided the poop thing, but unfortunately
1697960	1699480	you swung too far the other way.
1699480	1705000	And yeah, but that is coming out, I guess, July 14th.
1705000	1707080	It's going to be running through that through the 16th.
1707720	1709320	So cool.
1710360	1714840	We got news that there is going to be a new Detective Pikachu returns.
1714840	1716200	I guess that's the name of the game.
1716200	1717720	So new Detective Pikachu game.
1719000	1720760	And it looked cute.
1720760	1723320	And that is coming out on October six.
1723320	1727880	Then I mean, I guess the Detective Pikachu news is kind of exciting, but like then they
1727880	1729000	dropped the bombshell.
1729000	1729720	The first bomb.
1729720	1730200	Wait, hold on.
1730200	1731160	Before I get to the bombshell.
1731160	1733400	Yeah, I just want to say Detective Pikachu.
1733400	1734440	I was still disappointed.
1734440	1737560	It's not Danny DeVito that's doing the voice in there.
1737560	1741480	People were saying it's Will Arnett, but it's actually not Bobby went over this on his show.
1741480	1746840	It's actually the same voice actor that does Ichiban's voice, but kind of sounding inspired
1746840	1748840	by Will Arnett type of thing.
1748840	1751000	But anyway, you slice it.
1751000	1752360	It's not Danny DeVito.
1752360	1754760	And that is quite disappointing.
1754760	1755960	I'm sorry to say.
1755960	1757320	So you have that as well.
1757320	1758600	So anyway.
1759880	1763000	Okay, so Loki, this was a big one, right?
1763720	1764220	Yes.
1764760	1769560	So they announced that Super Mario RPG is getting a remaster.
1770680	1773720	And that's going to be coming out this year on November 17th.
1773720	1775640	And it looks fantastic.
1775640	1776280	That's awesome.
1776920	1779480	Yeah, it's extremely hyped for that.
1780280	1785480	This is one of those things that I really did not think this was ever going to happen.
1785480	1787000	And here we are.
1787000	1791960	And it's not just re-releasing the old Super Nintendo game, which I think plenty of people
1791960	1793480	would have been happy with.
1793480	1797080	But it looks like they have legit reconstructed it from the ground up.
1797080	1803400	There's no other way to make the game with this much graphical modernness that this game
1803400	1803640	has.
1803640	1807480	This is completely remade from the ground up, which makes me wonder if maybe they're
1807480	1808920	going to add to it or change it.
1808920	1810520	You know, it would be cool.
1810520	1815160	I think people are assuming it's going to be a quote unquote, shot for shot remake.
1815160	1816280	But why should it?
1816840	1821640	If they rebuilt this from the ground up, which they would have had to do, maybe they've
1821640	1823080	made some additions or changes.
1823720	1828040	I don't think we're going to be talking like Final Fantasy 7 remake type of thing, but
1828040	1829720	it could be DLC or something.
1829720	1830200	Yeah.
1830200	1832040	Well, careful what you wish for.
1832040	1833160	But yeah, for sure.
1834680	1838040	Because also they're going to charge full price for this.
1838040	1839560	This is going to be a $60 game.
1839560	1841560	Now, I think it's worth it.
1841560	1843000	It better not be a $70 game.
1843000	1843800	No, it's $60.
1843800	1845800	The price is already out there because you can pre-order it.
1845800	1848440	And it's eligible for the Nintendo voucher.
1849080	1852920	So if you still haven't taken advantage of the Nintendo voucher between this and the
1853800	1855880	Maybe you still need Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
1855880	1859160	You probably have stuff to spend the voucher on.
1859160	1861080	So it's worth considering.
1861080	1866520	And remember, Costco, you can get $100 worth of credit for $90.
1867400	1870680	So if you use the Costco hack, or there might be other stores that do this, too.
1870680	1871960	But I just know of Costco.
1871960	1876280	If you use the Costco hack, you can get two games for $90.
1876280	1878040	You're taking it down to $45 a game.
1878040	1879400	That's a pretty good deal.
1879400	1887240	So along with that, they announced that there is a new Princess Peach game coming in next year.
1889800	1891240	They didn't say much about that.
1891240	1893800	And we've had a Princess Peach game before.
1893800	1895480	But it was on the DS.
1895480	1898040	And it didn't look anything like this.
1898040	1901640	So I think they're just kind of ignoring that one and making a new Princess Peach game.
1901640	1908680	Because this one, to me, it honestly looked like she had the Dressphere from Final Fantasy
1908680	1911640	X-2 to me is kind of what I saw here.
1911640	1914440	But there was very little gameplay at all in this.
1915320	1918120	You could just see maybe a little bit of the art style.
1918120	1919800	Maybe looks a little bit Paper Mario.
1919800	1920440	Just a tad.
1920440	1921240	Just a tad.
1921240	1924120	But then you definitely see that she does like, oh, transform.
1924120	1925480	And now I'm an ice princess.
1925480	1926840	But don't call me Rosalina.
1926840	1928760	It looks like a stage almost.
1928760	1932760	Like everything's a set, which is interesting.
1933480	1939320	Then Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon is being ported or remastered, I guess, as well.
1939880	1941560	So that was originally a 3DS game.
1941560	1943080	And now it's coming to the Switch.
1945000	1946680	I just want to get some quick comments from chat.
1948120	1948680	That's funny.
1948680	1950520	Orange Right says $60.
1950520	1952040	Technically the budget price now.
1952040	1953560	OK, maybe not for Nintendo yet.
1954520	1956360	Vid Power 573 is in chat.
1956360	1960520	Hello, saying Super Mario RPG was the best thing about that entire Nintendo Direct.
1961080	1962360	Many people are going to agree with you.
1962600	1967960	Honestly, that Direct could have been five minutes with just that announcement.
1967960	1970440	And people would still say it was one of the best Directs they've ever done.
1971400	1974840	Just because that's the mother load for so many people.
1974840	1979880	That's the game most people have been waiting for them to remake for a very long time.
1979880	1985080	So again, honest to God, hear me out.
1985080	1991240	If they have followed that up with, we're remaking Mother and we're releasing Mother
1991240	1997160	3 on Virtual Console, that would have literally been the Sony event where they were like Final
1997160	2001000	Fantasy 7 remake, Shenmue 3, Last Guardian.
2001880	2003400	We're giving it to everybody today.
2003400	2008040	Like, like if that if that had been the thought, like this would have been the the the
2008040	2012680	insurpassable Nintendo Direct if they had put the Mother series out there on the table as
2012680	2012920	well.
2012920	2016680	But unfortunately, that is indeed too much to ask for Mother 3.
2016680	2019400	Still, still think about it, y'all.
2019400	2024200	We're getting Super Mario RPG remade from the ground up for a modern console before
2024200	2027960	we get a fucking Virtual Console release of Mother 3.
2029880	2030840	Just a reminder.
2031480	2031720	Yeah.
2033240	2039160	So and then they had to, you know, bring down the hype, I guess.
2039160	2043880	So they announced that the Batman Arkham trilogy is coming to the Nintendo Switch.
2043880	2047720	I mean, it's a good series, but it's just, it's so old.
2047720	2049240	Yeah, it's old news.
2050120	2052200	This strategy didn't work for the Wii U.
2053000	2054360	Why should we care now?
2054360	2055480	I mean, exactly.
2055480	2056920	They did that last time.
2056920	2061320	They brought out the Batman Arkham stuff for the Wii U and it was like super late too.
2061320	2064200	And it's, yeah, the armored edition.
2065000	2065240	Cool.
2065880	2066380	Okay.
2067720	2068600	Gloomhaven.
2069160	2073400	It's a dungeon crawler game that's coming September 18th.
2075400	2076520	So like kind of neat.
2076760	2080840	Also, another game that I didn't need to see a trailer for, but they announced it anyways.
2081720	2084280	Again, Just Dance 2024.
2084280	2084520	What?
2084520	2085640	It's coming to the Switch?
2085640	2086760	I never knew that.
2087320	2091560	Like, it's every year, but they're just like, no, hey, there's another one.
2091560	2092040	Yay.
2093560	2096600	Then there was some more RPGs.
2096600	2100280	We had Silent Hope, which looks interesting.
2101240	2110680	And Fae Farm, which is a fantasy farming game, and that's coming out on September 8th.
2111320	2117560	The new Hot Wheels Unleashed game, Turbo Charge, is coming out in October.
2117560	2120600	And that looks pretty cool because the first one is actually pretty sweet as well.
2121880	2128200	Manic Mechanics, kind of a fun little, like, I think it's like a co-op game.
2129160	2135720	And we had Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC, which this is shown during the Ubisoft
2135720	2140600	event as well with Rayman in it as well.
2140600	2143480	So that's going to be out, I think, later this year.
2144440	2149480	Dragon Quest Monsters, The Dark Prince, is coming in December.
2151080	2153480	And that one's been new game.
2154200	2156840	I think it's been out for a long time in Japan.
2156840	2160920	It's one of those things where it's like we're finally getting it after a very long
2160920	2161720	time type of thing.
2163960	2164680	Let's see.
2164680	2169320	So then we got yet another trailer or extended look at Pikmin four.
2170360	2173960	I'm just so glad that this game is coming out so I don't have to see it again.
2173960	2181160	Like it's been shown so many times, but there's a demo that's coming out later this week
2181160	2183480	and it's releasing July 21st.
2183480	2184040	Thank God.
2185160	2186200	This is kind of neat.
2186200	2191560	So Metal Gear Solid Master Collection volume one that has Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear
2191560	2196040	Solid 2 Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is coming to the Switch.
2196680	2199320	And that's on October 24th.
2199320	2204920	I did not realize that this was also in Sony's press event because I was texting somebody
2204920	2207080	and I was like, Oh my God, this looks incredible.
2207080	2209800	And they were like, it was the same thing they showed at Sony's event.
2209800	2213160	I was like, Oh, well, Sony did theirs while I was working, so I didn't see everything.
2213160	2215720	So I'm very excited about this collection.
2215800	2218520	But you know what makes me like, here's the thing.
2218520	2221640	It's one thing to have all those Metal Gear games, which looks great.
2221640	2227720	But did you notice that the MSX version of Metal Gear, as well as the MSX version of
2227720	2231640	the real Metal Gear two in English are in this collection?
2232440	2233080	Yeah, that's pretty.
2233080	2234440	That's all I need.
2234440	2236680	That is literally all I need.
2236680	2237960	I don't need anything else.
2239400	2242040	I'm so excited about those games coming out.
2242040	2245480	Dark Sakura, you know the Metal Gear MSX stuff.
2245480	2248120	Surely you've got to be excited to see this coming out too.
2248840	2250360	I'm excited about this.
2250360	2251320	That's pretty cool.
2251320	2251820	Yeah.
2252120	2253000	Yeah, I know that.
2253000	2257160	Well, I mean, we've already played through the MSX ones.
2257160	2262600	Yeah, it was a bonus disc for like Metal Gear Solid 3, something like that.
2262600	2265960	Well, I'm referring to MSX emulators.
2265960	2266520	Oh, yeah.
2266520	2267560	Well, yeah, there's that too.
2267560	2268060	Yeah.
2268700	2273100	But it's nice that it's coming in this collection and not in a collector's edition type of thing.
2273100	2275100	So, yeah, that's really exciting.
2276540	2278460	Yeah, that'll be neat.
2278460	2278940	Yes, yes.
2278940	2280940	Anyway, sorry, Loki, but I had to put that out there.
2282940	2287740	I was as excited about that as some of you were about the Mario RPG thing, which I'm
2287740	2288380	excited about too.
2288380	2288940	Don't get me wrong.
2288940	2289440	Yeah.
2290140	2293180	Vampire Survivors is going to be coming to the Switch.
2293180	2293980	It may make sense.
2293980	2294700	It's done well.
2294700	2296860	Kind of surprised it wasn't already there, honestly.
2296860	2297660	Yeah, exactly.
2298540	2303500	There is a game called Headbanger's Rhythm Royale, which features a bunch of pigeons
2303500	2305660	and you have to move their heads and do stuff in time.
2306220	2314140	It's kind of like a party game slash it almost reminds me a little bit of Fall Guys, but
2314140	2315740	not with like obstacle courses.
2315740	2319180	So you're just kind of competing different mini games and getting eliminated as you go
2319180	2320540	along, which is kind of cool.
2321420	2323420	Can I quickly just say this comment from chat?
2323420	2329180	VidPower573 says, surprise, they're including the NES Snakes Revenge game in the collection,
2329180	2332380	the game that Hideo Kojima didn't approve of back in the day.
2332940	2334860	Kojima's no longer with Konami.
2334860	2336860	They don't give a hoot what he thinks at this point.
2336860	2339020	So I think that's an incentive for Konami.
2339900	2344380	Honestly, I think it's one of those things where if they hadn't, it's a really easy thing
2344380	2344940	to include.
2344940	2347820	And if they hadn't included it, they probably would have gotten crap.
2347820	2352940	I also wonder, I'm assuming there would be a Japanese version of this release as well.
2353420	2357180	And so it's kind of the opposite for them where it's like, it's the first time.
2357180	2360620	Well, it's not really the first time we're getting the MSX games, but for many people,
2360620	2366060	I wonder if it's the first time Japan gets to see Snakes Revenge officially, not that
2366060	2366780	they should care.
2367580	2369100	But you know, it's kind of one of those.
2369100	2369900	Oh, now I get-
2369900	2371260	It's not a bad game, actually.
2372700	2374380	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2374380	2374780	Go back.
2374780	2375260	Go back.
2375260	2375740	Think back.
2376380	2382780	When the game came out, there wasn't really anything else too much like it, you know?
2383420	2383980	I suppose.
2383980	2385020	It had good music.
2385740	2387420	It had solid gameplay.
2387980	2393900	Yes, it wasn't an official Metal Gear Solid 2, but it was a pretty decent game and people
2393900	2396460	shit on it now because, oh, it's not the real sequel.
2396460	2397180	Meh.
2397180	2397980	No, no, no, no, no.
2397980	2400540	Go back and actually watch a playthrough of it.
2400540	2402140	It has some really solid music.
2402140	2405500	It's not a bad game by any means.
2408300	2409580	Well, you'll have the chance to-
2409580	2410460	Why watch a playthrough?
2410460	2411980	You can play it yourself pretty soon.
2412860	2415100	Yeah, why play it when I could just watch a playthrough?
2416220	2416620	All right.
2416620	2417660	Anyway, sorry, Logan.
2419020	2422220	Then we have a game called Penny's Big Breakaway.
2422220	2425660	It's a colorful platformer with lots of penguins.
2426380	2427340	That looks pretty cool.
2428140	2431500	We got some news regarding the next boost course pass.
2431500	2434140	Wave 5 for Mario Kart 8.
2434780	2440460	And they showed off a brand new track that was inside of a bathroom.
2440460	2447820	And they also have new players, new characters, I guess, coming to the game as well.
2447820	2456940	So we have Wiggler and Kamek from Mario Kart Tour and also the Piranha Plant from Mario Kart 7.
2456940	2458060	I don't remember which one it was.
2459020	2460220	Oh, no, I'm sorry.
2460220	2463180	Mario Kart 7 had Wiggler and Kamek and Mario-
2464220	2465660	Kamek's from Mario Kart Tour.
2465660	2467180	Wiggler's from Mario Kart 7.
2467180	2469340	Don't remember where the Piranha Plant thing was from.
2470460	2470940	One of them.
2472540	2475020	I think those are the two new ones or three new ones.
2476220	2482220	Star Ocean Second Story R is getting a 2.5D remake.
2482220	2482860	This is a big deal.
2483660	2484780	Yeah, that looked pretty cool.
2486700	2487420	Let's see.
2487420	2488220	This was sweet.
2488780	2490380	We're getting a new WarioWare game.
2490380	2491820	So WarioWare movement.
2491820	2494220	Can I say just quickly, though, about the Star Ocean remake?
2495100	2500060	It very much looks like that same engine for Octopath, Triangle Strategy,
2500940	2504140	this to me looks like it was built in that same engine.
2504140	2507820	I mean, it doesn't look exactly the same, but it definitely like it's that same style
2507820	2510060	of like the pixel art on the rendered backgrounds.
2510060	2517900	And so this very much bodes well for continuing remakes over at Square Enix for some of these.
2519740	2522860	The more and more of these that come out, the more I go, you know what?
2522860	2524620	Chrono Trigger isn't out of the question.
2525500	2529580	I don't want to set the bar too high, but Chrono Trigger is not out of the question.
2529660	2533020	Even just Star Ocean two is huge for a lot of people.
2533020	2533980	The fact that that's coming.
2533980	2535020	So anyway, sorry, Logie.
2536140	2538620	Yeah, so like pretty cool WarioWare move.
2538620	2542700	It is going to be a brand new WarioWare game using motion controls.
2543340	2545740	And I mean, they had me in the first half.
2546460	2547340	Exactly.
2547340	2550860	Like I love WarioWare, but the games looked ridiculous.
2550860	2554860	I'm not I mean, it's something for kids.
2554860	2556060	That's what I'm chalking it up to.
2556060	2556620	That's fine.
2557180	2558940	Not everything for Nintendo has to be for me.
2559580	2563500	And then we had the last bit of like, eh, it's news.
2564220	2570620	They tease Nintendo Live Seattle 2023, where you can go check out stuff in person.
2570620	2574540	That's going to be September 1st and they're open registration
2575180	2577580	or they already have open registration for that.
2578140	2580700	And then, of course, new me, both for Tears of the Kingdom.
2580700	2582380	So Zelda and Gendorf.
2583020	2589100	And then they ended with a brand new 2D Mario game, Super Mario Brothers Wonder.
2589100	2589660	Finally.
2590860	2593820	And it looks awesome and is coming out in October.
2595900	2597980	Yeah, the new 2D Mario look great.
2597980	2599340	It had an elephant.
2599340	2602300	Mario is now like the new thing everybody's leeching on to.
2602300	2605980	Like, you know, you had cat Mario and then you had a tanuki suit Mario.
2605980	2609660	You know, there's always like some new Mario suit that people go wild for.
2609660	2612300	And now Elephant Mario is the new one.
2612300	2613900	It looks it looks neat.
2613900	2615020	The game itself.
2615020	2618860	I didn't think the trailer made it look it looked weird to me.
2619420	2623340	I feel like it'll look better in long form gameplay than it did in the trailer to me.
2624540	2627580	I mean, I love 2D Mario games, so I'll pick it up regardless.
2627580	2630380	But yeah, I mean, it looks pretty amazing.
2630380	2634220	I'm surprised it took them this long with the movie, but maybe this is something they
2634220	2635820	were trying to get out with the movie.
2635820	2640140	And for whatever reason, be it, you know, pandemic went on longer, you know, technically
2640140	2643020	still going, but, you know, lockdowns went on longer than anyone could thought of or
2643020	2643340	whatever.
2643340	2648140	I don't know if it was just a miscalculation on that part, but it is nice to see that it's
2648140	2648540	happening.
2649900	2656140	Also nice to see now what Nintendo is doing with their holiday, because remember when
2656140	2659020	they were trying to make us believe they're not doing anything this holiday?
2659020	2660940	I was like, that is not true.
2660940	2662460	I don't believe that for one damn minute.
2662460	2664220	And so now, OK, here we go.
2664220	2667420	Mario RPG, a new 2D Mario.
2667420	2670700	OK, now we're getting a bigger picture as well as like what they're actually working
2670700	2671740	on for the holiday.
2671740	2673500	And that's that's pretty cool to see.
2673980	2681180	Some folks also out there on the Internet believe that that was not Charles Martinet
2681180	2683740	voicing Mario in the trailer, which is.
2685020	2686860	Leading to a lot of interesting thoughts.
2686860	2691900	Sorry, I heard a thud, thud, thud, and it's just Cheddar trying to open one of our cabinets
2691900	2693100	because he's a little brat.
2694060	2695100	You know what?
2695100	2699420	I hear that with Midna trying to open doors and cabinets by head butting them.
2701180	2702300	She understands physics.
2702300	2703260	What the hell is that?
2703260	2705340	Thud noise is like the neighbor banging on the wall.
2705340	2708620	No, it's just Cheddar trying to open a cabinet off, off cam.
2708620	2708940	All right.
2708940	2711020	Oh, you got this Cheddar.
2711020	2713020	Alan just overheard what I was saying.
2713020	2713740	Alan went and.
2715500	2718540	Threatened him with a finger and Cheddar ran away.
2718540	2719740	This Cheddar is a scaredy cat.
2719740	2724860	OK, the dark tattoo says, yeah, my wife's cat will do that.
2724860	2726060	She'll hide in the cabinets.
2726060	2729980	Dude, if if Cheddar gets in the cabinet, I don't think he's going to be able to have
2729980	2731660	the physical energy to push himself out.
2731660	2731980	I don't know.
2731980	2736060	Maybe he will, but I just I worry he'll get in there and he'll be like, oh, no.
2736060	2737020	How did I get in here?
2737020	2737820	How do I get out?
2739740	2740620	Anyway.
2740620	2740940	All right.
2741980	2742540	What else?
2742540	2745580	Oh, Charles Martinet may not be the voice of Mario.
2745580	2749660	Maybe this is all alleged, but some people are, you know, sleuthing the trailer.
2749660	2751020	I have a couple of thoughts about that.
2751580	2757740	I feel like Nintendo may be realizing that that the voice of Mario cannot just be wahoo,
2758300	2760060	and all this for a while.
2760060	2765820	And they have to maybe because of the movie, they're going to have to look at how can Mario
2765820	2767660	speak in full sentences in the games.
2768780	2771660	And so they may be looking to recast the voice actor for that reason.
2771660	2777740	I do not think a certain crispy rodent will be doing the voice at the video game level,
2777740	2781500	but they'll probably get someone to emulate him, just like, you know, we were talking
2781500	2785420	about Detective Pikachu and who are who it may or may not be emulating.
2785980	2787900	Um, and here's the other thing.
2787900	2789500	What's the condition of his voice?
2790140	2790300	Yeah.
2790300	2792940	I was going to say Charles Martinet is also in his late sixties.
2792940	2797100	And if he wants to have a beautiful retirement, he's earned every minute of it.
2797100	2800700	If he wants to just go around to conventions and collect money for signing autographs and
2800700	2803500	doing selfies, that is his fucking right at this point.
2803500	2806140	So I think we also have to, yeah, there's
2806140	2809980	June four eight went well into her, you know, nineties.
2809980	2810780	True.
2810780	2811280	True.
2811840	2816640	But, um, you know, there's, but, but she, she won it.
2816640	2819280	Well, didn't she have a break for a while?
2819280	2819840	A long while.
2819840	2820800	And then she kind of came back.
2822080	2823680	Yeah, off and on.
2823680	2826160	I mean, I think she was just doing it as she could.
2826160	2826400	Yeah.
2826400	2828880	I mean, Charles Martinet may come back for a Mario multiverse.
2828880	2830400	Well, and again, we're assuming he's gone.
2830400	2833200	He might not be, but people, you know, the internet's doing its thing.
2833200	2838400	And I think we do need to kind of realize the Mario movie may have changed some things
2838400	2844480	and just the evolving technology may have decided to have an impact on the directorial
2844480	2845280	approach to Mario.
2845280	2850160	So I'm just trying to prepare everyone for the fact that Charles Martinet may not be
2850960	2855760	associated with Mario moving forward, but obviously he will always be the voice of Mario
2855760	2856960	to many of us in our hearts.
2856960	2861920	But, you know, he joined, he joins a legacy of many awesome Mario's, um, including, you
2861920	2865920	know, captain Lou, you know, any, many other people that have voiced him in the past.
2865920	2869200	But, um, you know, anyway.
2869200	2872960	I mean, think about how many of the modern, you know, cartoons out there where they've
2872960	2878320	had people, um, you know, new voice actors in the role because someone's died or retired.
2878320	2884560	I mean, think of how many cartoons had replaced, uh, character voices when Casey Kasem died.
2886560	2889200	I mean, he was a lot of Transformers voices.
2889200	2893520	He, um, was, uh, uh, Shaggy, wasn't he?
2894320	2895040	Yeah, he was Shaggy.
2895680	2896240	So, yeah.
2896240	2898400	But now they got Matthew Lillard to do it, so.
2898400	2900080	Which is, he's fantastic too.
2900880	2901040	Yeah.
2901040	2906640	But I mean, I'm just, I'm just saying there's, there's even, you know, modern, you know, mouse.
2907600	2912240	Well, yeah, I think about, um, not, not because the person died at the time.
2912240	2916400	Unfortunately, they're no longer with us now, but I think about Aladdin and how Robin Williams
2916400	2921840	did it in the movie, but then for the sequel, and I think there was a TV show, uh, Dan Castaneda,
2921840	2922560	I think is his name.
2922560	2923840	The guy that does Homer Simpson.
2923840	2924400	Homer.
2924400	2924640	Yeah.
2924640	2925440	Does the voice.
2925440	2926480	No, it's a good, yeah.
2926480	2929440	Like it was, it was, it was a great job.
2929440	2932400	Like it almost like it's a talented voice actor.
2932400	2932560	Yeah.
2932560	2938480	It was jarring at first, but then like, as you watch the show, you just got used to it and it's
2938480	2940560	like, Oh, and then you go back and watch the original movie.
2940560	2942160	Like, Oh wait, that's jarring now.
2942160	2943120	Like that's weird.
2943120	2944800	But yeah, he did a great job.
2944800	2945200	Yeah.
2945200	2950560	So, you know, that's, that's my thought is they're probably going to get someone to give a more,
2950560	2955120	uh, crisp rodent type of approach to the character that you saw in the movie
2955120	2958000	to try to bring those universes a little tighter together,
2958000	2960560	especially because the movie's getting a sequel.
2960560	2962400	Like, no question.
2962400	2965440	No, we're getting a sequel to the movie period.
2965440	2968480	Uh, the movie did too damn well for us not to.
2968480	2973680	Um, so the, and you know, you know, obviously these things are planned years in advance,
2973680	2976960	but I think Nintendo probably took a safe bet that this was going to be a universe
2976960	2978560	to build on for a long time.
2978560	2983600	So anyway, some talk about Matthew Lillard and chat, uh, fix, fix.
2983600	2985840	He is actually saying Matthew is no longer shaggy.
2985840	2988640	He was replaced for the newer scoop movie.
2988640	2992800	Uh, and then some folks pointing out that Matthew Lillard will continue to be booked
2992800	2997280	and blessed anyway, because he's in the five nights universe now with that movie coming out.
2997280	3001520	So, uh, it's yeah, but I just, I just happened roles change.
3002720	3005440	He's such a, like a good actor as well.
3005440	3012960	Like my wife, once again, really into like horrible, um, dramas, uh, but she used to
3012960	3015440	watch a lot of, Oh God, what was it now?
3015440	3016080	Good girls.
3016720	3018080	And Matthew Lillard was in there.
3018080	3022560	He played a character named Dean who is absolutely hated because he was just like such a,
3023440	3028080	he wasn't a horrible character, but he was, he's a, he's a weak male character in the
3028080	3029360	show type of thing.
3029360	3034000	But like out of like all the cast, like he's like the most humble and the most like approachable
3034000	3036960	and just overall genuinely nice guy.
3036960	3037280	Yeah.
3037280	3042800	So, uh, he was in twin peaks, uh, the, the reboot, uh, twin peaks, 21 years.
3043360	3045040	What was the name of the reboot?
3045040	3046000	Not season three.
3046560	3048160	Oh, the return twin peaks, the return.
3048160	3050160	He was in that for like one or two episodes.
3050160	3052160	He wasn't in it very long, but he was in that too.
3052160	3053840	So yeah, he's, he gets around.
3053840	3054240	Good guy.
3054800	3055040	All right.
3055040	3056560	Anyway, back to the Nintendo direct.
3056560	3058800	Uh, how did you feel about it overall?
3058800	3061120	I thought I, I actually watched it live.
3061360	3065040	While I did emails, cause I didn't have any calls that early, thankfully, but I did emails
3065040	3065440	on one screen.
3065440	3068720	I was kind of like watching the other and I was like, dang, dang, you know, like it was,
3068720	3071200	it was definitely an E3 level presentation.
3071200	3076000	I mean, there was a lot of filler, but there was a lot of, there was a lot of tent pole
3076000	3078400	announcements to justify it too, you know?
3078400	3083280	And in the sense that like, again, for me, I don't really give a hoot about Pikmin 4,
3083280	3086080	but I realized that is someone else's tent pole game.
3086640	3087760	Um, and that's cool.
3087760	3090800	So yeah, there was like, they did have some something for everyone.
3091200	3096240	Not that I don't like Pikmin 4, it's just that they've, I've seen it so much.
3097360	3101280	They're like, they're, they're getting to no man's sky type of level of showing that
3101280	3101920	game off.
3101920	3105280	Like, and then they'll probably still be another full direct for it.
3105280	3105920	Of course.
3105920	3108080	And then there's going to be the DLC and stuff.
3108080	3111040	It's like, I just like, I don't care about Pikmin that much.
3111040	3113280	Like, just stop showing it to me.
3113280	3114640	That's the thing is like, I get it.
3114640	3118960	I know what's coming out, but like, chill, please.
3118960	3122640	The Pikmin game I do play regularly, Pikmin Bloom has already announced that they're
3122640	3124000	going to do a tie in event as well.
3124000	3126800	But they're just repeating what they already did for Pikmin 3.
3128000	3128960	When that released.
3128960	3129280	Oh yeah.
3129280	3130720	And then Pikmin 1 and 2 are out.
3130720	3134400	So at least if you are a Pikmin fan, like every game is on the Switch now.
3134400	3135440	That's not the mobile game.
3135440	3137120	So that's neat.
3137120	3138720	It is nice to have everything on one platform.
3139520	3140880	So all right.
3141760	3142720	Um, let's move on.
3142720	3146320	That was a lot of news, but it was a, it was a good, uh, it was a good direct chock full
3146320	3149920	of a lot of stuff that there's something in there you're looking forward to.
3149920	3152080	There was something in there you're looking forward to.
3152720	3158160	If not Mario RPG, then maybe Star Ocean, you know, or Metal Gear collection or something
3158160	3161360	you're looking forward to in that, that, um, direct.
3161360	3161600	Okay.
3161600	3164880	Let's talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we have been playing this
3164880	3167040	week while we wait for all these other games to come out.
3167600	3168960	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
3169920	3176720	Um, I played, uh, Dead by Daylight, of course playing the, um, the seventh anniversary
3177440	3181840	business, um, which is, is pretty fun stuff.
3181840	3186240	Still a lot of stinky killers, but I was doing some offline play with Fixie and with Shayla
3186880	3190080	and, um, and I was having fun.
3190080	3192320	Of course I played Midnight Suns last night.
3192320	3198000	Um, you know, cause honestly enough, that's like my, my break from everything.
3198000	3199760	It's the end of my work week.
3199760	3203280	I need to do something that I can just whatever on.
3204160	3207600	Um, so, so yeah, I played that last night.
3207600	3211040	And of course, uh, I did not play Cult of the Lamb.
3211040	3214640	I actually did not stream on Juneteenth because that's not my day.
3215520	3221520	It, it was a day to focus on our, uh, our, uh, by POC folks.
3221520	3223040	And so I didn't stream on that day.
3223840	3230560	Um, also been playing my stupid word scapes game because I'm an addict and a word nerd
3230560	3231280	and it was great.
3232000	3235600	And, um, yeah.
3236720	3239520	But of course I played pinball because I played pinball.
3240640	3241200	So that's it.
3241760	3242080	All right.
3242080	3244160	Oh, and Dan played, Dan was playing BurgerTime.
3244880	3245920	Hey, that's a good choice.
3245920	3247280	I got a BurgerTime machine behind me.
3247280	3248800	It's a good choice of game to play.
3250320	3250820	All right.
3251140	3253060	Uh, Loki, how was your game week?
3253940	3255700	Uh, I mean, I played Minecraft.
3256740	3257220	What?
3257220	3258020	You never play that.
3258020	3259300	I know it's a shock.
3259300	3261780	I, yeah, let's just like constantly do that.
3261780	3264020	No, I took time off to play more Minecraft actually.
3264020	3266660	Um, didn't get as much done as I wanted to though.
3266660	3269940	Cause I was trying to get a jump on content creation for the week.
3269940	3273700	I did put out my episode earlier this week though, which I did a lot in already.
3274260	3279780	And you know, I'm still working on the two last areas, the two last robot masters.
3279780	3286660	So I have stuff like for that, I built another, um, or I will be building a another giant,
3287300	3291140	uh, mega man to enemy.
3291780	3293540	So there'll be another one of those.
3293540	3299060	Um, so I did finish that and then, uh, just to try and figure out what I want to put in
3299060	3305940	some of these areas, it's, it's as the end of the season is getting closer, it is harder.
3305940	3309540	I am getting to that creativity, uh, burnout.
3310340	3314820	Well, it's just, I guess, uh, some of this, cause the initial concept for all the robot
3314820	3319700	masters, they didn't really have like a strong, like, Oh, here's what I want to do for all of
3319700	3319860	them.
3319860	3322260	So some of them it's like, Whoa, what do I do for this?
3322260	3323140	I don't know.
3323140	3328260	Like in it's kind of sitting there for days until finally something clicks and then you
3328260	3328900	just build it.
3329460	3336500	Um, so I'm kind of in that mode right now where like I am building frog man's area,
3336500	3337620	which is in the swamp.
3337620	3345700	So there's, you know, uh, I built a Willow tree that looks cool that I'm going to be
3345700	3351140	decorating stuff with, um, and did some like, uh, paths and stuff, but like, I don't know
3351140	3352980	like what structures to build there.
3352980	3356900	I was like, thought about, Oh, cause it's kind of slime based stuff.
3356900	3363540	So like, uh, not sewage, but like a toxic waste processing plant or something like that.
3363540	3367940	But that kind of looks like the same stuff that I have on in another area as well.
3367940	3369940	So I was like, I don't know if I want to do that.
3369940	3372740	So I'm just going back and forth, figuring out what I'm going to do for that.
3373460	3375940	Hopefully I get past that hurdle pretty soon.
3375940	3380820	And then the last bit is going to be Wiley's castle, which at least that I know what that
3380820	3380980	is.
3380980	3382740	I mean, that that's pretty easy.
3383380	3387460	Um, so yeah, wrapping things up there a little bit.
3387460	3390740	Um, I did, I was hoping to get it this week, but I haven't gotten it yet.
3390740	3396180	I ordered a, um, because Facebook keeps advertising to me this nonsense.
3396180	3400660	They have all these like wood kits that you can buy to build things.
3400660	3403780	Um, and they kind of like a slot together.
3403780	3407380	So this one is a wooden pinball machine.
3407380	3414500	It's like a tabletop, like, I don't know, 12, 18 inch machine that actually has the,
3414500	3416500	all the electronics for it and everything.
3416500	3417140	So that's gonna be fun.
3417140	3420580	I can't wait to put that together and, uh, play a little bit of pinball with that.
3421620	3422100	Nice.
3422100	3424580	It's circus theme that has a circus.
3424580	3427540	Thankfully, the circus music can be turned off.
3427540	3428900	They put a switch in.
3428900	3433460	Thank you manufacturers for doing that because that would have been irritating, but yeah,
3434020	3436260	it'll be neat to kind of put that together.
3436260	3436760	Cool.
3437620	3438340	All right.
3438340	3439860	Uh, well, that's it for your gaming week.
3439860	3444420	Then my gaming week, um, I continued to play Diablo four, uh, still in the end game for
3444420	3445060	that.
3445060	3446260	Uh, so it was playing that a little bit.
3446260	3450180	I was even playing some dead by daylight, uh, a little bit, especially with the, uh, anniversary
3450180	3453460	event having just started, you know, I got to make sure I get some cakes, uh, that I
3453460	3455140	can use year round on one of my characters.
3455140	3456580	So there was that as well.
3456580	3460500	Um, but obviously if you know me and you've been paying any attention over the last few
3460500	3464820	weeks, you know, that the day final fantasy 16 came out, I've been on board with that
3464820	3465540	a hundred percent.
3465540	3469460	I've been playing that since, uh, the demo kind of picking that up from the demo, um,
3469460	3470420	and continuing on with the game.
3470420	3475300	So obviously I'm not done yet, but I've, I've sunk a good, I don't know, maybe 12 hours
3475300	3475700	into it.
3476100	3481380	It's, it's literally all on actually at this point, YouTube, because I've been doing something
3481380	3482180	I don't usually do.
3482740	3487460	So when I usually stream narrative games, I'll stream the main quest and I'll play side
3487460	3488980	quests off stream.
3488980	3493220	But what I'm doing is that I'm still recording myself doing side quests and I'm putting it
3493220	3494100	on YouTube.
3494100	3496340	So all of my gameplay is over on YouTube.
3496340	3501220	Um, over on my, my personal channel there, Rob Roberts plays, don't just go to Rob Roberts
3501220	3504580	cause that's somebody that sells guns, go to Rob Roberts plays.
3505220	3508260	And that's my YouTube channel and I have my full 16 play through, or of course you can
3508260	3509700	follow me on Twitch on there.
3510260	3512100	So I'm still in progress with the game.
3512100	3514980	I obviously I'm going to make sure I keep it spoiler free.
3514980	3516420	I'm not going to do that to you.
3516420	3521780	Um, but you know, I've, I've been going through some very key elements of the story just finished.
3521780	3529380	I will say a story mission where I got the prompt that said, you are about to do a pivotal
3529380	3534820	story in the game and, uh, you will only be able to do certain things from here.
3534820	3538340	Uh, the type of warning you would get in Final Fantasy 14 before a major quest.
3538340	3539460	So there were, there was that.
3539460	3545620	So, um, yeah, I, I I've been exploring the game and, um, I do still really like it.
3545620	3547860	I do think what's happened.
3547860	3550420	And I think this is actually very clever on their part.
3551060	3557300	They really front loaded a lot of the story, meaning that two hour demo or the prologue
3557300	3562900	or the early years of Clive, as it were, uh, that they released as that demo 10 days ago
3562900	3566020	was very stacked with story and stuff.
3566020	3572180	Because when you start the retail game, after that point, the pacing slows way down to what
3572180	3577380	you would expect in a more traditional RPG, which is let's go find the hub.
3577380	3579540	Let's explain these systems.
3579540	3583780	Let's go through some of these maps that are a little bit linear while we're still explaining
3583780	3586340	and laying the groundwork for the Y and all this.
3586340	3592420	It's not bad, but it's a real jarring, like pacing shift from what happens in that demo.
3592420	3596500	It does start to pick back up and there are some more story moments that kick in.
3596500	3601300	You do get it's, it is not, even though some of the early levels, you'll start to be like,
3601300	3606100	Oh no, we've got Final Fantasy 13 syndrome going on here where the maps are very tunnel-y.
3606100	3608020	They, they do, they fix that real quick.
3608020	3611940	And you do get some really big open maps, more like you might see in something like
3611940	3615700	Final Fantasy 14, again, is a really good mold for what you get here.
3615700	3617780	It's like a single-player Final Fantasy 14 game.
3619140	3624660	But I also understand now playing through this, why Final Fantasy and Square Enix, you know,
3624660	3630420	and why they're having this crisis about should we even number Final Fantasy games anymore?
3630420	3637620	Because the series has taken a big shift from the earlier turn-based RPGs.
3637620	3641860	Now, unlike some of the articles I've been reading out there on the internet, which do
3641860	3642980	not make sense to me.
3642980	3648020	And I start to wonder, have some journalists played a Final Fantasy game before?
3648020	3649700	Have you watched the show Tamar?
3649700	3653540	Like, it's very that like, have some of you journalists played a Final Fantasy game before?
3653540	3658980	Because 16 is not the first time that the game went action-based combat.
3658980	3663940	That, that's, that's actually what everyone was ticked off about in 15, the last Final
3663940	3664900	Fantasy game that came out.
3665380	3672260	I assure you, the combat in 16, way better, light years better than Final Fantasy 15.
3673860	3678660	It's, it's very satisfying to control and the accessories that you can do and all that
3679540	3683860	really help you be able to skill the fights down to what you want.
3684580	3689700	But it does take a lot of the quintessential turn-based elements.
3690740	3692180	Casting magic is different.
3692180	3693300	It's there, but it's different.
3694900	3697060	Limit breaks are there, but they're different.
3697060	3701940	So it's that the fact that it is a little war rooted in action is going to, you know,
3701940	3703220	rub some people the wrong way.
3703860	3710660	But this is a direction the franchise has slowly been moving in since Final Fantasy
3710660	3711220	11.
3712820	3715540	11 was the first one that got rid of turns.
3715540	3717620	They had to because it was a live MMO.
3718260	3720660	And then some of that was incorporated into 12.
3720660	3721780	12 didn't have turns.
3722340	3727940	And then even in 13, yeah, you, you kind of had the more turns, but it's still, you were
3728580	3731220	setting up things at a time and it was still playing out live.
3731220	3734660	13 was them kind of trying to marry the two a little bit.
3734660	3737300	But then, you know, ever since then, it's been a little more action-based.
3737300	3741540	But I understand that the series has departed a little bit from what it used to be.
3742500	3744340	And that's going to rub some people the wrong way.
3744340	3745460	I understand.
3745460	3750180	But I still think the game stands on its own as a solid game.
3750180	3755620	But I understand, you know, it's been a journey from Final Fantasy 1.
3755620	3757780	And it's not a journey everyone wants to follow.
3758580	3765700	Now, I understand that series like Octopath Traveler, Bravely Default.
3766260	3769460	There's other series out there for folks that missed that.
3769460	3772500	But I understand that there's people that want to see that rooted in Final Fantasy.
3773860	3779220	That all being said, if you look at the Final Fantasy series as having always been a trailblazer
3779220	3785300	series of sorts, you know, like with things like the active time battle and things playing
3785300	3788660	out a little more live, you know, like it did in Final Fantasy 4.
3788660	3791780	And, you know, the gambit system and some of the things that, you know, Final Fantasy
3791780	3792900	has really changed the game.
3792900	3796180	And, you know, you kind of look at this as just the series continuing to evolve.
3796740	3797860	I think it is.
3797860	3798900	I think it is really neat.
3798900	3799620	I think it's good.
3800820	3804020	The story, again, heavy adult themes.
3804740	3806340	Some people are going to be really thrown.
3807060	3809780	Um, but it's holding up.
3809780	3811460	The story is very interesting.
3811460	3815940	I thought at first it was getting a little predictable, but then they kind of did a gotcha
3815940	3816580	type of moment.
3816580	3818500	And I was like, oh, okay, interesting.
3819140	3825220	I guess the only maybe small drawback I would have is that I have noticed that some of the
3825220	3829700	dungeons get a little like I was in a dungeon.
3829700	3834340	I was even on stream and I was kind of commenting like, okay, I'm ready to be done with this
3834340	3835860	and to advance the plot.
3835860	3841460	Because I feel like I'm doing trash, trash miniboss, trash, trash, and it starts to fall
3841460	3846820	into that dangerous pattern from 14, which is something that 14 has been criticized about
3846820	3853060	is that a lot of 14 is very formulaic, especially when it comes to the end game dungeons.
3853060	3858340	Every single one of them, trash pack, trash pack, first boss, trash pack, they're all
3858340	3859140	the same.
3859140	3860340	They all look great.
3860340	3861540	They all sound great.
3861540	3862980	They all have different mechanics.
3863060	3866420	But there's a certain formula that they have a hard time breaking.
3866420	3870500	And I'm a little worried 16 may fall victim to some of that.
3871140	3875140	But that isn't as hard of a read on the game as you might think.
3875140	3879780	I actually think there's a lot again, the combat for me not playing a lot of these type
3879780	3880980	of action games.
3880980	3883060	It's really fucking satisfying.
3883060	3887460	And the way you weave in and out abilities like, oh, you're doing Phoenix's move and
3887460	3892180	then you swap to a different icon like instantly you're doing their moves and swapping again.
3892660	3895540	It's really satisfying and feels really good.
3895540	3898420	So I'm excited to see from here where the story keeps going.
3898420	3901220	But the early hours have really pulled me in.
3901220	3901940	That's for sure.
3902580	3908660	SSG100Matt says if OLR is 21 and old enough to drink, Final Fantasy 16 is sneaking into
3908660	3910420	its first R-rated movie.
3910420	3914260	Well, what's interesting about that, and I was reminded on Twitter, one of our listeners,
3914260	3919620	Ziba, hi, if you're listening, reminded me on Twitter, hey, actually 16 was not the first
3919620	3921540	game where they were killing chocobos.
3921540	3924260	Do you remember Final Fantasy Type Zero?
3924260	3927380	And I was like, oh, yeah, I do remember that game.
3927380	3932980	I didn't like it, but it did have the adult themes were kind of in that game too.
3932980	3935700	And it was another one of those like war type of games.
3935700	3940420	I think the battle in that I did not like the battle system in that game, but it's interesting.
3941380	3945940	Why couldn't I mean, I'm glad it wasn't, but why couldn't Final Fantasy Type Zero have
3945940	3946980	been a mainline game?
3947380	3953940	Why couldn't Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin have been a Final Fantasy one part
3953940	3955620	zero game?
3957780	3960900	Like these, it is interesting.
3960900	3968500	And the Final Fantasy team is having a crisis of and why does Final Fantasy 13 versus get
3968500	3970260	upgraded to Final Fantasy 15?
3971140	3975300	Well, that's because long development time, but like I was going to say, why don't they
3975300	3980020	why don't they just have spin off series like they did with like a dragon, you know,
3980020	3986180	where they had that it was its own, which is a term based action game, you know, and
3986180	3986980	that's amazing.
3986980	3987860	And that did well.
3987860	3989380	And you can have narrative and stuff.
3989380	3991460	So you can have your KD too.
3991460	3996260	You can make your action games for the folks that like action stuff, and then you make
3996260	4000980	your traditional Final Fantasy games for the people like the traditional stuff.
4000980	4003540	And then you can even go in the middle and make something, you know, kind of a little
4003540	4004020	bit of each.
4004020	4010820	But like, I don't I don't really buy into like the excuse that, well, you know, a lot
4010820	4014900	of people just nowadays they don't like term based stuff because they didn't grow up with
4014900	4016020	it and blah, blah, blah.
4016020	4017300	It's like, yeah, but like.
4018660	4023700	I don't think that people aren't playing like some of the classic RPGs because they're
4023700	4024260	turn based.
4024260	4026260	I and I yeah, I also disagree.
4026260	4031220	Now, while I'm fine with the choice that they made in 16 to do what they do with the battle
4031220	4032260	system, I'm fine with it.
4032980	4039780	Yeah, that comment is very short sighted of like Dungeons and Dragons is bigger than ever.
4040420	4044660	Thanks to the pandemic and, you know, podcasting as well.
4044660	4051540	Like I would say more kids today know Dungeons and Dragons than probably when we were all
4051540	4051860	kids.
4051860	4052500	I mean, sure.
4052500	4053540	Of course, D&D was the thing.
4053540	4054180	We were all kids.
4054180	4055220	Most of us played it.
4055220	4059220	But I mean, just in the popular lexicon and how many people play it and are exposed to
4059220	4061220	it, I would actually argue it's more today.
4061780	4064100	So don't tell me people don't know turn based RPGs.
4064100	4064660	That's a lie.
4065220	4068180	Well, it's also the same argument that they tried to make before where they said single
4068180	4070420	player games are popular anymore.
4070420	4072660	And then, like, well, that came all their life.
4072660	4073540	Service game item.
4073540	4074660	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
4074660	4077220	And all it's like, that's not true at all.
4077220	4080420	Like, and then they have the eat crow on that as well.
4080420	4084100	But I mean, obviously, the reason they made that argument the first was because they want
4084100	4087460	to go live service so they can monetize the crap out of it.
4087460	4089780	They're like, Well, see, you guys wanted this.
4090020	4092580	It's like, no, no, no one did.
4092580	4097940	And that's the thing, too, with Final Fantasy 16 is I think a lot of it, it could be almost
4097940	4102180	like you're changing it so much that you're going to lose the people that were like kind
4102180	4104500	of fans of Final Fantasy to begin with.
4104500	4105700	And that's kind of the thing, too.
4105700	4111940	For me, like even with a 15, like it was so radically different than, you know, maybe
4111940	4116820	like not as radically different as 13, but like it was different enough to where like
4116820	4118180	I didn't stick with it.
4118180	4121700	And normally, like I will finish all of those Final Fantasy games.
4121700	4127380	But that was like one of the first ones that in type zero that I didn't really want to
4127380	4128340	finish.
4128340	4132820	And that's why I was kind of like, well, aside from the fact it's on PlayStation five and
4132820	4137620	I don't own a PlayStation five, that's the only reason I'd hesitate on Final Fantasy
4137620	4138340	16.
4138340	4143780	And and like even the review that I watched from a reviewer that I respect, didn't like
4143780	4144420	the game.
4144420	4150820	And they didn't like it because that it felt like there was very little in the sense of
4150820	4157220	gameplay and a ton of cut scenes, like 75% of the game is cut scenes, which there are
4157220	4162100	better ways to like tell your story and have cut scenes incorporated with that.
4162100	4165540	But I would be curious, what did that what did that reviewer think of persona then?
4166900	4167940	They like persona.
4167940	4173700	Okay, so so so so I'm sorry, but that's that do you see where I'm like that they just
4173700	4174660	contradicted themselves.
4175460	4176020	Right.
4176020	4182820	I think though, that in this sense, it was more of like, you know, you can have cut scenes
4182820	4189220	that are like kind of like God of War, for example, God of War has story cut scenes that
4189220	4190820	are in the gameplay.
4190820	4193620	It's not just like, okay, I'm doing game and stop.
4193620	4195460	And now you got to watch cut scene.
4195460	4203300	You know, it's your interacting with it, you it's it's told in a dynamic way that doesn't
4203300	4205460	interrupt the gameplay flow.
4205460	4205960	Yeah.
4207300	4207780	Yeah.
4207780	4208740	I mean, I don't know.
4208740	4212100	Like I think the cut scenes are fine as for a Final Fantasy game.
4212100	4216740	I'm not bothered with it because I feel like all like all Final Fantasy games since like
4216740	4222180	seven fuck even like four and six and five had like very long sequences where you weren't
4222180	4222820	doing anything.
4222820	4225620	I mean, probably not as bad in the Super Nintendo era, but especially when you started
4225620	4226660	getting to seven.
4226660	4229380	And so that like the cut scenes are like a mainstay in it.
4229380	4230980	And you know, you're kind of there for the story.
4230980	4237460	But I mean, I can see where maybe some of my complaints about how some of the formulaic
4237460	4240500	layout and then you combine that with the cut scene.
4240500	4245940	I can see where some people can maybe like get a little irritated with that, you know,
4245940	4248260	so, you know, again, I'm not saying this game is perfect.
4248260	4252100	I'm not even I'm actually at this point, not sure it's going to be my favorite Final
4252100	4254420	Fantasy game, but it's going to be in the top half.
4254420	4256660	I could I, you know, I'm not through.
4256660	4258820	I may be 40% of the way through the game.
4258820	4261860	I already know this is better than 15.
4261860	4262900	It's better than eight.
4262900	4263780	Sorry, not sorry.
4263780	4265060	It's better than two.
4265060	4268900	It's better than like the bottom tier of Final Fantasy for me.
4268900	4274580	It's better than it's certainly better than 14 original version, which is the worst Final
4274580	4275220	Fantasy game.
4276500	4281140	So 16 will absolutely be in the top half of the ranking.
4281140	4283140	I'm just not sure exactly where yet for me.
4283940	4287860	But I think, yeah, it's there's a lot of good stuff in there.
4287860	4291460	But I'm curious to see where the story ends up going.
4291460	4295620	I have I've seen that there is criticism about that the story apparently takes a turn at
4295620	4300340	some point, and that the back half of the game was not as exciting as the front half
4300340	4300740	of the game.
4300740	4301780	I've heard that.
4302340	4304820	But I'm going to draw my own conclusion on that.
4304820	4310020	And because, you know, again, critics, I don't know, they don't always see it the same way
4310020	4310500	I do.
4310500	4311380	So we'll see.
4312660	4312980	All right.
4313780	4315060	That was my gaming week.
4315060	4317300	Let's get into some gaming news.
4317940	4320660	Quickly, though, I want to just do some quick housekeeping things.
4321220	4325380	I want to give a shout out to the Dragon Con digital media track because earlier this week
4325380	4333460	on the 20th, I was able to moderate a virtual LGBTQIA kind of panel discussion with some
4333460	4336740	other content creators over there on the Dragon Con digital media track.
4336740	4337620	That was really cool.
4337620	4339460	It will be archived on YouTube soon.
4339460	4342660	I don't think it's there yet, but I'll post the link on socials when that's up.
4342660	4346900	But I just wanted to acknowledge and thank the folks that participated with that and
4346900	4348820	the Dragon Con digital media track for doing that.
4349540	4356820	Speaking of things to do in Atlanta, we will not be here the week of July 30th because
4356820	4358820	I will be in Atlanta.
4358820	4363780	I'm going to be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo.
4363780	4365460	I keep forgetting they changed their name a few years ago.
4366100	4369540	But I will be there at that expo to help them celebrate their 10th anniversary.
4370340	4371780	I'm very excited about it.
4371780	4373380	I'm looking forward to being there.
4373380	4376180	My picture is even on the website as somebody that's going.
4376180	4377380	So that's really fun.
4377380	4378500	I was very happy to see that.
4378500	4380420	That's always a fun thing to do.
4380420	4384100	So I look forward to joining you all in Atlanta twice this year.
4384100	4387460	Once for SFGE and once for Dragon Con.
4387460	4390660	But unfortunately, because of that traveling, there won't be a show that weekend.
4390660	4391940	But that's like a month away.
4391940	4393780	But just warning you all.
4393780	4395380	Okay, let's get into some news.
4395380	4399220	We'll probably, since the front half of the show is really long tonight, I'm probably
4399220	4401780	going to accelerate our pacing on these stories a little bit.
4401780	4403620	But I know there's some things we want to talk about still.
4403620	4404260	So, Loki.
4405140	4407220	Yeah, this is kind of a minor story.
4407220	4413380	But the Game Pass prices are rising, apparently.
4413380	4418740	So and including the Xbox Series X will also be increased worldwide.
4420340	4427380	They're saying that the Game Pass is going to be going up from, I guess it's not a lot.
4427380	4428820	It's like a buck or so.
4429620	4438740	So from $10 to $11 worldwide and the Game Pass ultimate is going up from $15 to $17.
4439620	4443940	And Microsoft, of course, says, you know, we've held our prices for consoles for many
4443940	4448980	years and adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market.
4449700	4454420	And these Game Pass price adjustments are not related to the Activision Blizzard deal
4454420	4457540	and are intended to match our local market conditions.
4459060	4466900	So they're saying that the Xbox Series X will remain $500 in the US, but it's going up to
4466900	4478260	550 euro in Europe, $650 Canadian in Canada and $800 Australian in Australia.
4478260	4480660	That's beginning August 1st.
4480660	4485140	The Game Pass pricing is going into effect July 6th, so right around the corner.
4485380	4485880	Hmm.
4486260	4491940	So stock up on that year of Game Pass if you want to get in at the lower price or whatever.
4491940	4499060	So I mean, we kind of knew the Game Pass price was going to go up eventually, but I just
4499060	4503700	feel like I don't think Game Pass has had quite as strong of a year as previous years.
4503700	4507380	I feel like a lot has been delisted from the service and they're adding new things, but
4507380	4509860	it's not they're not really getting the big, big names.
4509860	4511220	I think Starfield is good.
4511220	4513540	That's you know, I know I'm very happy about that.
4513540	4517380	And there'll be some other big names too, but I'll pay it.
4517380	4520820	You know, it's still a great deal and so forth, but it's just one of those like, oh, it's
4520820	4522340	just the timing of now.
4523380	4527540	It's like, oh man, if only the Activision merger could finish and they could add all
4527540	4532900	those games too, then I think it gives them really the bandwidth to really up, which they'll
4532900	4535540	probably do again once that happens, quite honestly.
4536100	4536660	But we'll see.
4536660	4540100	We'll see what happens because that merger may not happen, but we'll get to that news
4540100	4540600	later.
4541320	4543400	All right, let's move on.
4543960	4548200	Let's talk about one of those big Activision games, Diablo 4 out of Blizzard.
4549160	4554520	People now that more and more people are finishing the main story, people are looking forward
4554520	4557240	to the seasonal content.
4557240	4563000	At some point in July, Diablo 4 seasons will begin and it's getting some pushback because
4563000	4567320	the seasonal content is going to require players to complete a new character.
4568200	4569800	It was talked about in a blog.
4569800	4572440	Well, actually the blog post didn't talk about it.
4572440	4581000	And then on Twitter, Rod Ferguson responded to somebody, I think it's, I'm going to just
4581000	4586440	bite my tongue, but I just don't think this person usually contributes great articles.
4586440	4593480	But anyway, saying that you will, yes, to take part in the seasonal quest line, mechanics,
4593480	4597560	season journey and battle pass, you will need to create a new seasonal character playing
4597560	4601640	campaign with seasonal character will also progress the season journey and battle pass.
4602600	4605400	And people are not happy about it.
4605400	4609400	Saying, as a new player, I don't see myself grinding like this again, if I have to start
4609400	4611960	from scratch, I'm likely done maining Diablo.
4611960	4613880	And I know a ton of people in the same boat.
4616200	4620520	I'm sorry, why the fuck are you maining Diablo and going so far to say that if you didn't
4620520	4625480	play Diablo two or three, where this was the exact same way it worked.
4626360	4627320	This isn't news.
4628200	4630120	Diablo has always done a level read.
4630120	4631800	That's what seasons are all about.
4632840	4639560	So I'm trying to like figure out like, why are people so weird about this when it's literally
4639560	4640600	always been this way?
4641160	4647400	And my only thought is because of that open world, really strong narrative structure of
4647400	4652440	Diablo four, people are really worried about having to play it all over again.
4652440	4658200	But they've already said, if you've played through the main story already, then when
4658200	4664120	you do seasons, the map is unlocked, the Lilith statues are unlocked, you don't have to do
4664120	4664680	that again.
4665480	4669640	You just get that on your seasonal character and you can level however you want, which
4669640	4673640	is how you leveled seasonal characters in three and then to remastered when they went
4673640	4674280	back and did that.
4674840	4677720	I really failed to see the problem here.
4677720	4682120	And this is one of those headlines that again is being copy pasted like wildfire.
4682120	4688840	And I don't understand the hysteria around it, but I'm pretty passionate about Diablo.
4688840	4695560	It's no no secret around here, but I just it's it's silly.
4695560	4697800	It's it's non non news to me.
4697800	4702440	Pirate pound town and chat says, Yeah, this is just bandwagon gamers jumping into Diablo
4702440	4704280	without knowing what Diablo is.
4704280	4704840	That's what it's.
4704840	4709400	So when somebody says I'm maining Diablo, you didn't put a lot of research into that
4709400	4710120	before you did it.
4710120	4711080	Now, did you?
4711080	4714920	Because that's that sounds like a content creator saying that.
4715720	4720680	And I'm like, do your homework before you declare that you are the world's definitive
4720680	4722040	Diablo streamer.
4722040	4727000	Like, obviously, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's just that comment just
4727000	4730120	comes from a place of, do you watch the show Tamar?
4730120	4735720	Anyway, let's move on to other news.
4735720	4739080	Dark Sakura, why don't you talk about a completely different game for us?
4740440	4746600	Well, for anyone who is a fan of the original chocobo racing, there is now chocobo GP.
4748680	4754680	And it's not going to nickel dime you for making any progress in there.
4755400	4767000	And it has a new eShop store page that shows that it's like a rerelease on the switch
4767000	4767960	for June 15th.
4768760	4772280	It's going to have some neat little stuff in there.
4775720	4777640	I'm sorry, I can make words happen, I promise.
4778120	4788280	But basically, this is it really got bad reviews before, partly because of the paywalls
4788280	4791320	and the grind and all of that.
4791320	4793640	So now it's just going to be open.
4794920	4797240	You also will get extra experience points.
4799560	4804520	Well, sorry, they did do extra experience points as sort of an apology for that.
4804520	4814680	But now this one is pretty much going to be, they're not going to do any big updates,
4814680	4815640	no new characters.
4818600	4827080	And yeah, so the rerelease is going for about 50 bucks.
4828520	4833560	But this is, yeah, just you can transfer your previous save to the rerelease version.
4834440	4837640	Just by buying it as an upgrade DLC for the light version.
4837640	4839080	And then there you go.
4839080	4839580	Yeah.
4841400	4844600	And Mike Deft in chat saying this is what it should have been from the start.
4845400	4848600	Dark Tetsuya is saying, I don't know, I got to say the ship has sailed on this one.
4848600	4851800	They should have done it this way from the get go instead of charging 40 bucks for a
4851800	4853080	free to play game.
4853080	4855400	Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm with all of you.
4855400	4859160	Like this is definitely them going back and going like, whoops, this is how we should
4859160	4860280	have done it from the beginning.
4860280	4863480	And for all intents and purposes, it's probably too damn late.
4864360	4871240	But it is interesting and rare to see a game company do that and try to be like, oops,
4871240	4875000	let's relaunch this game the way the fans are saying we should have done it in the first
4875000	4875500	place.
4875960	4877560	It is rare to see that.
4879400	4881400	I just don't know if I'm interested anymore.
4883240	4887000	I have been interested since Chocobo racing.
4887000	4889640	Yeah, yeah, I loved Chocobo racing.
4890280	4893400	I didn't love Chocobo GP when I played it.
4893400	4899720	And I think, admittedly, the whole micro transaction system was a part of what left the huge taste
4899720	4900280	of my mouth.
4900280	4906200	But honestly, do I care enough to go back and now play a full retail price for the game?
4906840	4907340	Nah.
4909080	4909880	Nah, I'm over it.
4911160	4911720	Which is a bummer.
4911720	4914280	I mean, there are people out there who are very happy about it.
4914280	4915400	And I'm glad for them.
4915400	4917240	Yeah, and my dad says I care.
4917240	4917740	Yeah.
4917740	4920300	Yeah, our opinion is not necessarily the definitive.
4923100	4925420	People are burned by different fires.
4925420	4926060	Yeah.
4926060	4932220	And to be fair with what Dark Tetsuya says, maybe if it went on sale, I could go, yeah,
4932220	4936460	like when that game comes down to $20, because inevitably it will come down to $20 and I'm
4936460	4938300	willing to play that waiting game.
4938300	4939660	I'll probably pick it up then.
4939660	4940540	I'll pick it up for $20.
4941740	4947660	But I'm not going to pay, you know, for, yeah, what it should have been the first time.
4948300	4952300	So anyway, let's move on.
4952860	4953360	Loki.
4954300	4954700	Yeah.
4954700	4962940	So there's more drama still with the whole Activision Blizzard acquisition and Sony PlayStation
4962940	4964060	along with that as well.
4965180	4972860	So now this is a little bit that came out about Jim Ryan and some of his private remarks
4972860	4976060	regarding the acquisition deal that was going in place.
4976060	4982860	You may remember that Sony has made the argument that if that they don't believe that Microsoft
4982860	4992140	will make good on their promise to keep Call of Duty multi platform in public, they say
4992140	4997740	that at least Jim Ryan, however, in a private email that was shared, apparently with the
4997740	5001020	court, said it's not an exclusivity play at all.
5001020	5007420	It says they're thinking bigger than that, and they have the cash to make the moves like
5007420	5007660	this.
5007660	5015420	I spent a fair bit of time with Phil Spencer and Bobby Kojic over the past day, and I'm
5015420	5020460	pretty sure we will continue to see Call of Duty on PlayStation for many years to come.
5022140	5028780	So like they know that it's going to be, you know, available for the PlayStation.
5028780	5035100	Microsoft is committed to three years already, and yet they're just making it out, obviously,
5035100	5037180	because they don't want the deal to go through that.
5037180	5038060	No, no, no.
5038060	5043580	It's not going to be, you know, exclusive at all, even though in their minds it is.
5043580	5046940	It's going to be available on their system, and that's not an issue.
5048780	5051580	Also, this was crazy as well.
5051820	5060940	Well, Jim Ryan also shared that if Activision were to be actively to be acquired by Microsoft,
5060940	5067500	then Sony wouldn't share PlayStation six info with the developers of Call of Duty.
5067500	5073660	Also, another argument that they've made before is that, well, you know, if Microsoft buys
5073660	5076780	Activision Blizzard, they're just going to make a version of Call of Duty that's going
5076780	5079180	to suck on PlayStation hardware.
5079180	5082060	It's just going to play poorly and they're going to think, oh,
5082060	5085580	it's the PlayStation hardware and not Call of Duty that's playing poorly.
5086620	5090300	But now you're like saying that, oh, well, we're not going to give you information about our system.
5090300	5092220	So what do you think is going to happen from that?
5092220	5096940	You would get a product that is not going to perform as well as it could because you're
5096940	5101820	withholding information because you're worried that they're going to have some sort of insider
5101820	5104140	information that will affect, you know.
5105420	5108620	The creation of the next Xbox console or something like that.
5109180	5112620	It is just ridiculous that you would go that far.
5113580	5116220	This court case is making Sony look real bad.
5116220	5117980	It's making them look drunk with power.
5117980	5120140	It's making them look like the one percent.
5120140	5125740	And it's it's making Microsoft look humble, which is a weird thing to say.
5125740	5130380	But as far as the games division goes, like you see Microsoft kind of admitting they know
5130380	5133500	they're lagging behind in the race and they know, you know, some of these things.
5133500	5136620	And yet they still, you know, they know they have to put games on certain consoles.
5136620	5141180	And just the whole fact that Sony is like withholding and doing what they're withholding
5141180	5144380	and then coming on the other hand and saying, oh, but we know we're getting a lesser than
5144380	5148300	version, like it's almost like they're they're they're the ones trying to squelch the
5148300	5152140	competition in the marketplace and it's coming out in court.
5152140	5155100	And it really doesn't make Sony look good, to be honest.
5155100	5158460	I don't think most gamers are going to give a shit because at the end of the day, Sony's
5158460	5161420	got really great exclusives and a pretty damn good console.
5161420	5162940	And that's what the gamers are.
5162940	5167100	But it's when you look at the business side of things like you definitely look at this
5167100	5169580	and you're like, Sony is not the good guy here.
5169580	5171660	And I'm not before you all today.
5171660	5173020	Oh, I'm a Microsoft fanboy.
5173020	5174700	I'm a Microsoft apologist.
5174700	5175740	I'm sorry.
5175740	5181100	It's just like, again, I'm allowed to draw conclusions and, you know, make opinions based
5181100	5182300	off these court documents.
5182300	5184780	It does not make Sony look like nice people.
5185340	5186620	It really doesn't.
5186620	5187020	Yeah.
5187020	5189180	And it's just like business isn't nice.
5189740	5190940	I understand that.
5191020	5195180	But it's just like one of those like, oh, it just makes a lot of those complaints that
5195180	5196300	Sony's putting out there.
5196300	5198860	Like, it's really exposing it for the bullshit that it is.
5199980	5200300	Yeah.
5200300	5202540	And honestly, I'm sorry.
5202540	5207580	Look, I worry our legislators and I worry they're too dumb and they're going to fall
5207580	5208380	for it.
5208380	5209340	Of course they're dumb.
5209340	5212380	Like, I mean, they don't understand how any of this stuff works.
5212380	5216780	Although I would say that they're probably more willing to side with Microsoft on this
5216780	5220860	because Microsoft being an American company and Sony being a Japanese company.
5221340	5225660	Unfortunately for them, it's just, you know, USA, USA, USA.
5225660	5227900	And it doesn't matter what the situation is.
5227900	5231660	I honestly don't think that they understand fully what's going on here.
5231660	5236220	And it's also very hypocritical of Sony, too, because Sony does the exact same things when
5236220	5242380	it comes to given the opportunity, they will absolutely pay for exclusivity on their console.
5242380	5244380	They have fucking look at 16.
5245980	5250300	That's not to say that Sony or Microsoft hasn't done the same thing in the past with like
5250300	5252060	third party stuff as well.
5252060	5255020	But you may get like a year of exclusivity or something like that.
5255020	5258220	But like, but yeah, they do this.
5258220	5262620	And to pretend like we don't do this, this is ridiculous.
5262620	5264060	We would never do that.
5264060	5264860	Like, come on.
5264860	5267900	Like, we don't trust you at all to do this.
5267900	5273100	And like for me, like, I don't even care anymore about console wars because I'm just going
5273100	5275500	for PC, PC, I win out everything.
5275500	5278140	I can play all the different systems on PC if I want to.
5278140	5280060	I mean, emulating Switch, of course.
5280060	5285900	But like I it's it doesn't really make sense to me to like dive into a console anymore
5285900	5287500	because I just don't play my consoles.
5287500	5289500	Like I don't play my PlayStation four.
5289500	5291980	I haven't played that in like over a year.
5291980	5296300	And my Xbox Series X is in a box under my desk right now.
5296300	5299580	Like it is not being used at all.
5299580	5302460	Like I just I don't know.
5302460	5305900	I bought a Series X and I used it hard for like two years.
5305900	5311420	But then when I upgraded my PC, my Series X is now the downstairs media device so that
5311420	5315100	Alan can watch 4K stuff through the Series X.
5315100	5317180	Like that's our PS3 for that.
5318460	5321100	Yeah, it's seriously like it made me reconsider.
5321100	5323740	That's why I was like, well, do I really want a PlayStation five?
5323740	5326380	Probably not, because like I just won't use it.
5326380	5329500	Like I won't get the money out of it like that.
5330140	5333260	It's just not worth it, especially for PlayStation VR, too.
5333260	5337340	Like that's just a money pit right there.
5337340	5342620	But yeah, I just we don't like any of these corporate companies nowadays.
5342620	5346300	You just we've gotten burned so many times by corporations.
5346300	5349500	I just don't trust Sony in this sense.
5349500	5351980	I don't trust Microsoft either, like 100 percent.
5351980	5355580	But at least they've been seeming to be more on the side of like the consumer.
5356780	5359900	Recently, that could all change one day, sure.
5359900	5362540	But like right now, they seem to be on the consumer side,
5362620	5364300	at least Game Pass is a great deal.
5364300	5367580	So well, it's a lot of that is in the leader.
5367580	5368540	A lot of it is in the leader.
5368540	5369420	Yeah, for sure.
5369420	5370300	Gaming on my Mac.
5372460	5374140	I don't trust anybody.
5374140	5377180	Well, and you don't have as many games to play either.
5377180	5379820	Yeah, actually, I pretty much can play just about anything.
5381020	5383740	So some of those games that you've talked about streaming in the past.
5385420	5388380	Well, come the next operating system, I won't have that problem at all.
5388380	5390220	Ask Whoopi Goldberg how Diablo 4 is going.
5390220	5393580	Come the next operating system, I won't have that problem at all.
5393580	5394460	I heard about that.
5396060	5397580	Some other comments in chat.
5397580	5402060	Dartusia says, I don't know, we're using our series S lately for D4
5402060	5405100	when the network wants to work and Street Fighter 6 mostly.
5405100	5410460	And honestly, Dartusia, if I hadn't upgraded my PC, I'd probably be in the same boat.
5410460	5412780	I'd be using a console to play those games as well.
5413660	5414540	Absolutely.
5414540	5415740	But yeah.
5416460	5419420	Also, you can play Diablo 4 on a Mac.
5419420	5420460	GeForce Now has it.
5421420	5422860	Oh, I didn't know GeForce Now has it.
5422860	5423180	That's cool.
5423180	5425820	Well, somebody needs to send that to Whoopi Goldberg.
5426860	5433580	So yeah, pretty much anything that's worth having is either coming out natively or is on a stream
5433580	5440140	service and like everyone knows the next, you know, as already has come out for the next OS
5440140	5447900	that the line like deal is going to basically make Maxfully Gaming compatible.
5448620	5453260	Well, and, you know, you bring up a good point about the cloud gaming in general.
5453260	5458700	I mean, that's just that's enabling gaming on many, many more devices,
5458700	5459980	Max and otherwise.
5459980	5464860	And, you know, laptops and, you know, phones, I guess, and tablets and things like that.
5464860	5467260	That's where, too, that's a lot, you know, cloud gaming.
5467260	5470220	We kind of look at how much of the future is really going to be in cloud gaming.
5470220	5475980	Again, I think we're just stable 5G over connections away from cloud gaming really taking
5475980	5476540	over.
5476540	5480380	And I think and so it's interesting to kind of go back to a lot of where this conversation
5480380	5481900	started about console wars.
5482620	5488460	I think that's the big, ironically, cloud looming in the sky is once 5G is available
5488460	5488940	anywhere.
5488940	5492540	I don't think you're going to need consoles anymore in the traditional sense.
5493740	5495420	So they're still going to try.
5495980	5499740	Of course, they're going to try really slow to abandon technology, but it's going to be
5499740	5505420	interesting to see how the consoles might evolve to make that case for what cloud gaming
5505420	5506220	can't bring you.
5506220	5508220	It'll be interesting to see what they do.
5510220	5510780	Excuse me.
5512620	5516140	Well, that court case has really been fascinating to see play out, and we're still going to
5516140	5517340	get more gems out of that.
5517340	5518060	That's for sure.
5519180	5520540	Loki, I'm sorry, I might have missed it.
5520540	5522860	You talk about the PlayStation six, that part of things.
5523900	5524380	Yes.
5524380	5525020	Okay, sorry.
5526460	5532780	Then let's talk about a different six in a series that I don't know if this game is ever
5532780	5533100	coming.
5533100	5536140	It feels like Elder Scrolls six.
5537340	5541260	Apparently, this was something that came out of this recent trial as well, or whatever
5541260	5546060	the hearings, whatever you want to call it that's going on right now is that even though
5546060	5554460	the Elder Scrolls six was announced five years ago at the 2018 E3 Expo, it was said
5554460	5558620	by Phil Spencer, this game is still five days or five days away.
5558620	5565980	I wish five plus years away, saying under oath, quote, I think we've been a little unclear
5565980	5570060	on what platforms that will launch on given how far out the game is.
5570060	5573900	It's difficult for us right now to nail down exactly what platforms the games will launch
5573900	5574460	on.
5574460	5579500	As I said with Elder Scrolls six, it's so far out, it's hard to understand what the
5579500	5581580	platforms will even be at this point.
5581580	5585580	It's the same team that's finishing Starfield, which comes out in September.
5585580	5589180	So we're talking about being likely five plus years away.
5589180	5593900	So when he's talking about platform, he's not talking about Sony versus Microsoft.
5593900	5597340	He's talking about would it be PS five or PS six?
5598460	5603500	Because they might be needing to prep this game for a more advanced console and the Xbox
5603500	5608700	equivalent of that, obviously, like whether it's series Y or whatever it is.
5609820	5614940	Phoenix 7726 says, Rob, at this rate, Elder Scrolls is going to beat Kingdom Hearts for
5614940	5616860	longest gap between sequels.
5618540	5624380	This just also goes to show how freaking long it is between big budget games.
5624380	5629820	I mean, you know, earlier in the show, I was talking a lot about Final Fantasy 16.
5629820	5633420	Think about how long it's been since Final Fantasy 15.
5633420	5637100	It's been seven years since Final Fantasy 15.
5637740	5638380	Wow.
5638380	5647980	Seven years is more time than what passed between Final Fantasy four, five, six, seven
5648860	5649580	and eight.
5650620	5653260	No, was 491 or 92?
5655100	5656540	Because eight was 99.
5657180	5659420	So 92 would have been seven years ago.
5660540	5666780	But at least five, six, seven and eight were all done within the same period that it's
5666780	5669100	taken 15 to 16.
5669100	5670540	So that's kind of food for thought as well.
5670540	5676140	That just speaks to the long development cycle of a lot of these games now, for sure.
5676140	5678940	So, you know, I'm not totally surprised to hear this now.
5678940	5682220	I'm kind of wondering, well, why did they announce this way back as they did?
5682860	5688140	But, you know, this was also before the Microsoft purchase, and maybe they had a different plan
5688140	5688700	to get there.
5689340	5692940	I'm not saying Microsoft's delayed it, but maybe Microsoft's going to force it to be
5692940	5696460	a more quality product when it comes out being less bugs.
5696460	5703180	Starfield is going to be very telling for if Bethesda has maybe changed some of their
5704060	5709660	things that they get razzed for a lot in the QA department or lack of addressing QA department,
5709660	5713260	I should say, since Microsoft took over.
5713260	5717100	Because if Starfield is still a buggy mess, people are going to be like, why the fuck
5717100	5718940	did they delay this as much as they did?
5718940	5724140	But if it's really, really polished, people are going to be like, wow, a Bethesda game
5724140	5725180	that actually, yeah.
5726060	5731340	So Phoenix 7726 says, to be fair, Rob, those games were not nearly as complicated and took
5731340	5732700	much less time to develop.
5732700	5735420	And at this point, these times are just going to keep going up.
5735420	5736300	Oh, exactly that.
5737100	5738700	I actually am making that same point.
5739340	5744060	Yeah, it wasn't as hard to do the sprite art in those days, and even the PlayStation 1
5744060	5748540	style art from seven and eight, and what goes into those games, then what games require
5748540	5749040	today.
5749580	5753340	So there's going to be a long wait between 16 and 17.
5754300	5757580	But I guarantee 17 is already under development.
5757580	5762060	I think the question is, is it another MMO or not?
5762060	5765100	Because 11 was an MMO, 14 was an MMO.
5765100	5769020	So if they follow the pattern, 17 would be an MMO.
5770060	5773180	I'm not sure they want to do an MMO now.
5773180	5778780	Again, I feel like 14 is still riding a wave that they could have another single player
5778780	5780140	game in a 17.
5780140	5785260	But it's so hard to say, you know, again, Square Enix maybe doesn't want to number their
5785260	5786780	Final Fantasy games anymore.
5786780	5787280	Who knows?
5787900	5793260	So yeah, and I agree Phoenix 14 is still going too strong.
5793260	5795420	No need to kill it and pull an Overwatch one.
5795420	5798460	Well, to be fair, 11 is still going.
5798460	5802860	I don't know if I would say strong, but it has people that love it very much and are
5802860	5803820	still showing up to play.
5804380	5809420	So even 11, you know, just a new MMO coming out doesn't negate the other necessarily.
5809420	5815260	But yeah, anyway, let's move on to whenever Elder Scrolls 6 finally comes out.
5815260	5816780	Many people I'm sure will stream it.
5817420	5820140	And so we always watch what's going on in streaming communities.
5820140	5820860	Right, Dark Sakura?
5821660	5822700	That we do.
5822700	5825260	And it's not the best news.
5826860	5830220	Well, I mean, if you're, you know, everybody except partners.
5831100	5842540	So there is this hype chat thing coming where basically you can pay to have your chat highlighted,
5842540	5847500	like pinned for a bit, you know, to guarantee that it'll be seen.
5848860	5851660	And you're basically buying your chat message.
5851660	5853180	This is not a new idea.
5853180	5855500	This has been happening on YouTube already.
5855500	5857100	I was gonna say, this sounds like super chats.
5857740	5858240	Yeah.
5859100	5860220	They're calling it hype chat.
5861100	5864700	So you can pay anything between $1 to $500.
5867100	5869740	You can set a minimum of up to $100.
5870460	5875420	And so depending on how much you pay, depends on how long it stays up as well as character
5875420	5876780	length in the visual design.
5876780	5889900	And this also gives the streamer a share of the revenue from the hype chat.
5889900	5891020	I don't know what that share is.
5893020	5898060	But I don't know what they're thinking.
5898060	5900700	They're not making this a friendly environment.
5902060	5905180	And then also though, and now this is slightly okay.
5906140	5914540	They're working on a new range of labels and tags to better identify the kind of mature
5914540	5916860	content that's being displayed.
5917420	5920780	So I mean, like for right now, it just had mature content and it could be anything.
5920780	5926700	So the new levels are going to be mature rated games, sexual themes, drugs intoxication,
5926700	5928060	or excessive tobacco use.
5928940	5929900	Why is that?
5929900	5930620	Whatever.
5930620	5936940	Anyway, violent or graphic depictions, significant profanity or vulgarity and gambling.
5939420	5948700	These are basically, they're not going to get people away with breaking the rules, but
5950140	5955740	these are out there just as general warnings for anyone who might peek in.
5955980	5960620	If the game has that kind of content in it, not necessarily the streamer.
5962940	5969660	So there's a lot of, what's the word I'm thinking of?
5969660	5974780	A lot of false reporting that goes on too, like retaliatory.
5975340	5981340	That I think they need to look a bit more at the current system of reporting and action
5981340	5983740	rather than adding more labels.
5985740	5996140	So anyway, I'm not going to kick because it's very abusive toward anyone who's basically
5996140	5999180	not, you know, straight sister white.
6000460	6008940	But I don't know, I won't say anything else about it.
6008940	6010060	I have feelings, that's all.
6010060	6010940	I have feelings.
6010940	6015660	No, so I don't think kick is, I've said this on the show previously.
6016300	6021180	I think last week, until there's an adult that's clearly in charge of kick, and it looks
6021180	6022300	like an adult is running it.
6023180	6025500	I'm not really interested right now.
6026140	6031660	It just seems a little bit like it feels like the ball pit at Dashcon right now.
6031660	6033260	And that's not a place I need to be.
6034780	6035820	Somebody peed in that thing.
6036460	6036940	You know it.
6039660	6041100	The ball pit at Twitch was better.
6041100	6042860	It had a mac and cheese in it.
6042860	6044140	Yeah, that is true.
6046060	6048060	Let's see other stuff in chat.
6049100	6056140	Mike Deft by Black Wolf, a few people pointing out that that split on the hype chats is 70-30
6056140	6058380	plus a 5% fee.
6058380	6064460	It just seems like a lot of, you know, like, why do I need to hype that?
6064460	6065500	Yeah, it's a money grab.
6065500	6067420	I'm not going to encourage people to buy that.
6067420	6069900	I mean, if at the end of the day, it's your money.
6069900	6071580	We're not partners anyway.
6071580	6072300	Oh yeah, that's right.
6072300	6073900	It's only partners, not affiliates.
6073900	6074620	That's right.
6074620	6076300	So yeah, it is.
6076300	6077660	It is a little silly in my opinion.
6079500	6083900	No one I know that's a partner would do that other than a joke.
6083900	6084400	Yeah.
6085340	6088540	Bobby in chat says the content warnings are fine for me on Twitch.
6088540	6090860	It helps advertisers target ads better.
6090860	6095020	The stuff about excessive drinking and smoking is about excessive drinking and smoking on
6095020	6095660	stream.
6095660	6098060	Taking a sip of beer doesn't need the content warning.
6098060	6099500	Doing a drunk show would.
6099500	6103100	And I'm assuming that's similar to there's a difference.
6103100	6105740	I wasn't talking about the drinking aspect of it.
6105740	6109820	Yeah, but I'm going to assume there's also a difference between somebody who does this
6110460	6114860	and has a little whiff of a pen once in a, in a, in a great while.
6114860	6120540	And somebody who's like fully got their bong out, taking hits between answering Q and A.
6121180	6123980	Like they just, they need to define it clearly.
6123980	6124620	Yes.
6124620	6125020	Yes.
6125020	6126140	Leaving it so subjective.
6126140	6126780	Exactly.
6126780	6127260	Exactly.
6127260	6129580	So are they saying that Doug Benson isn't welcome on Twitch?
6130460	6133180	Because they specifically said tobacco.
6133820	6135820	And I'm sorry, I know chain smokers.
6136380	6136540	Yeah.
6136540	6138540	Who will chain smoke during their stream?
6138540	6139040	Yeah.
6139740	6141900	So what's, what's excessive?
6141900	6143180	What's the definition of it?
6143180	6146700	Are they smoking like five packs in an hour or what?
6146700	6150860	I mean, that's, and it's a elaboration, but still.
6150860	6155740	Oh, apparently MJ always needs the content warning, even if it's just a small hit.
6155740	6156300	Interesting.
6156300	6163980	Cause a lot of DVD streamers I watch partake in between or even have channel rewards to partake.
6164540	6167820	So that's very, I mean, granted, if they're streaming DVD, it's already
6168860	6171500	a restricted channel because they're playing an M rated game.
6171500	6172540	So that's interesting.
6172540	6179580	But yeah, I think there's too much subjectiveness as stark Sakura put it.
6179580	6182620	I think there's, they're going to need to clearly define those lanes.
6182620	6186380	And for the love of God, get your affiliates and
6186380	6191500	partners to the table to help you in defining those lanes.
6192220	6194540	Oh, you know, they're not going to, I mean, now here's the thing.
6194540	6196780	I'm, I'm a member of Twitch RPG.
6198300	6203820	And I haven't really seen a whole lot being done with that.
6203820	6206940	You know, I do my surveys when I get them.
6206940	6209740	Oh, we'll, we'll give you a hundred bits to do this survey.
6210460	6216860	But there's, they're not like super in depth, you know, not,
6216860	6221580	not a really big survey or a deep dive into things that people might want to see.
6222220	6224780	And they're missing an opportunity with that.
6225420	6225920	Yeah.
6227820	6232540	Bobby is copy pasting some stuff from the fact that apparently does try to draw the
6232540	6237260	lanes a little more on what exactly alcohol use is, you know, smoking a cigarette and
6237260	6241340	all of that is, but even then they say, okay, for alcohol use, sipping on a drink
6241340	6245820	while streaming wouldn't require a label, but apparently appearing visibly intoxicated to
6245820	6249980	the point you are slurring your speech or making being drunk the focus of your stream.
6249980	6252540	For example, doing a drunk history would require a label.
6252540	6255500	I still say there's a lot of interpretation in there.
6255500	6256060	I get it.
6256060	6259580	It does sound like one extreme or the other, but what if it's not one of the extremes?
6259580	6263180	Who's to say what visibly intoxicated is?
6264140	6268620	And again, there's been plenty of false reports for other issues.
6268620	6269120	Yeah.
6269740	6275420	You know that I, I, they're going to need to step up their moderation staff.
6276700	6279980	And then of course, make sure their moderation staff is trustworthy.
6279980	6280940	Yeah, for sure.
6281660	6283500	I mean, cause we we've heard that incident.
6284300	6284860	All right.
6284860	6285980	Let's move on to our next story.
6285980	6287420	I've take a quick, quick AFK.
6287420	6289420	I'm sorry, but, uh, Loki, you want to take the next story?
6290220	6291020	Yeah.
6291100	6297340	This is not really surprising at all, but considering the whole, uh, situation with
6297340	6301580	E3 and the sudden cancellation in, uh, 2023.
6302460	6308940	Well, now it's coming out that according to information from the Los Angeles city tourism
6308940	6315180	board of commissioners held its regularly scheduled meeting and announced updates on
6315180	6322220	tourism and whatnot, and basically said that it didn't sound like that E3 was happening
6322220	6326060	in 23 or 2024 and 2025.
6326940	6336300	Um, and apparently, uh, the ESA has come out to say, ESA is currently in conversations
6336300	6341980	with ESA members and other stakeholders about E3 2024 and beyond, and no final decisions
6341980	6343900	about the events have been made at this time.
6343900	6347980	That doesn't say that they, that's not a yes that we're doing it next year.
6349180	6357340	So, um, I would assume that, you know, Los Angeles being the host city of E3 would be
6357340	6359180	aware whether they're doing it or not.
6359900	6365340	Um, as of right now, I wouldn't be surprised if it's canceled going forward.
6365340	6370300	I mean, honestly, I mean, there is no excuse this year aside from everybody dropping out,
6370300	6374860	I guess, I guess that's excuse enough, but I don't see everybody just all of a sudden
6374860	6376220	jumping on next year.
6376780	6378460	I don't think anything's going to change.
6378460	6379580	So I think they're done.
6380620	6385100	Um, Bobby and point, uh, Bobby and chat says this only means they're not doing E3 in LA.
6385100	6386460	It could be done elsewhere.
6386460	6387100	That's true.
6387100	6388460	It could be done elsewhere.
6388460	6389420	Go back to Vegas.
6389420	6390140	Yeah.
6390140	6391900	Why are we giving the ESA this much credit?
6393180	6395180	I don't E3 is done.
6395180	6395900	E3 has done.
6395900	6396780	E3 has been done.
6396780	6398460	It's here now.
6398460	6405180	Now the question is, how does it evolve with this whole partnership for the E3, as you
6405180	6408780	used to know it, as you used to attend is done is done.
6408780	6410380	It's been done for some time.
6411260	6416140	However, that name, you know, if we know, read pop, getting the rights to the name and
6416140	6418780	all this stuff, we know read pop also runs packs.
6418780	6425980	I think there's a very clear way that the E3 kind of what everybody thinks E3 is and
6425980	6429180	what packs really is, is kind of merged together.
6429740	6435500	And I think what we used to know is E3 ends up effectively becoming packs Southwest or
6435500	6435740	something.
6435740	6436380	No, it's not packs.
6436380	6438540	Southwest used to be like Texas, right?
6438540	6442700	I don't know, packs Pacific or something, which is packs prime, but I feel like there's
6442700	6446220	going to be either a Vegas or an LA type of packs.
6446220	6451180	And that's, you know, what essentially, you know, that time of year in E3 ends up turning
6451260	6454380	into, uh, where maybe even as either.
6454380	6459980	And I think I said this way back then, as I said, the first year it will be packs presents
6459980	6460940	E3.
6460940	6463900	And then after that year it will be E3 featuring packs.
6465980	6471740	And that's, that's where, and then it will be E3 in Boston, E3, you know, yes, ironically
6471740	6473980	E for all at the end of the day.
6473980	6474460	Yeah.
6474460	6477180	So that's where I think it goes.
6477180	6479260	And it's because of the read pop connection.
6479260	6483580	That's why I'm drawing that line because effectively read pop will own packs.
6483580	6486300	And then they're also going to have the rights to the E3.
6486300	6492540	So I think they inject that E3 stuff into packs, but it ends up being that what, what
6492540	6498140	this is basically what the fuck is packs had to do with penny arcade for a long time now.
6498940	6501180	So at some point it will just be E3.
6501900	6505420	And they already have like each featuring the packs board game lounge.
6506380	6509020	It's just like, it's, it's not really adding anything.
6509020	6511020	It's not like they're going to have word gaming content.
6511020	6513340	It'd be just basically what it was before.
6513340	6518940	By doing that, here's the thing, the ESA still wants to get membership dues.
6519580	6522780	That's why they're not going to know that I am being 100% legit.
6523500	6530220	So E3 is going to say, Oh, this is going to make it more attractive for the gaming companies
6530220	6531100	in that region.
6531180	6536300	And that's why I think there will be an LA San Diego or Vegas version of packs at some
6536300	6540860	point because of the game companies in that area, I guess you could do San Francisco as
6540860	6541580	well.
6541580	6545180	So somewhere, you know, Silicon Valley, San Jose even.
6545180	6549740	So somewhere I that's just why I see like a packs California or Vegas type of thing
6549740	6555100	happening because now that the ESA will have a stake in this, essentially the ESA will
6555100	6555580	have a stake.
6555580	6562460	And they'll be like, Oh, well, by you being in the ESA, we want you to exhibit at E3 what
6562460	6567020	used to be packs and try to draw more big name.
6567660	6573340	When packs has always been about indie, it was some big name sometimes, but try to use
6573340	6576300	that power to pull in more big boosts at your packs.
6578860	6579740	They can try.
6580380	6582780	Yeah, we'll see.
6582780	6584060	We'll see what happens.
6584060	6588940	So Pirate Pound Town in chat says Santa Clara, better venues.
6588940	6590620	I don't know if there's anything there that's big.
6590620	6593820	And honestly, even though I say San Jose, I don't think there's anything big enough.
6593820	6596940	Even the San Jose is probably not big enough for something.
6596940	6601020	Well, if it holds Fanime, it can probably hold E3, but it just depends.
6601020	6602620	It depends how big they want to go.
6602620	6609180	I just I think Vegas is the obvious cheap convention city, but San Diego is pretty good
6609180	6609420	too.
6609420	6611100	It's just San Diego can be kind of expensive.
6612060	6616380	So I can see them, you know, putting it somewhere.
6618620	6626140	Okay, moving on, let's get to our next story, which has to do with Quake 2.
6626860	6630700	Not one, not three, you know, the good ones, but Quake 2.
6632620	6639420	Apparently, a game rating and administration committee in Korea has rated Quake 2 remastered.
6639420	6641420	Well, this hasn't been announced yet.
6641420	6646460	This is also, by the way, how Quake remastered was announced before it was actually announced
6646460	6647420	in 2021.
6647980	6653260	Just an interesting aside, QuakeCon is coming up in August in Texas.
6654060	6659020	So if there's any legitimacy to this, which there probably is, then you're going to hear
6659020	6662300	about it at QuakeCon in August, which you probably will.
6662860	6665660	So look forward to a Quake 2 remastered.
6665660	6666060	You know what?
6666060	6668220	It is a good chance for that game to get a second chance.
6668220	6671660	I know I kind of, you know, make fun of it a little bit, but it just didn't play quite
6671660	6674620	the same as the first, you know, and it did a different thing.
6674620	6677420	But maybe going back and remastering it, you kind of revisit some of that.
6677420	6679500	And, you know, it's been a long time.
6679500	6680860	You take another look at it.
6681820	6687740	All right, speaking of classics, I think it's time for an old favorite segment here on our
6687740	6688460	program.
6688460	6689500	So let's roll the bumper.
6700060	6705500	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull
6705500	6707820	out a classic and tell you about it.
6707820	6710460	It's time for the classic game of the week.
6712220	6714700	And what did you pick for us tonight, DarkSagra?
6714940	6718540	I picked a game called Last Resort.
6719900	6723100	It is a horizontal shooter by SNK.
6723100	6726220	The arcade release was out in 1992.
6727100	6733980	Of course, it got a port for the home Neo Geo and Neo Geo CD systems and several other
6733980	6736700	rereleases, and I'll be getting into that momentarily.
6737980	6744620	The point that I want to bring up just to start off with has to do with the development
6744620	6752780	and the reason why some things may look kind of familiar, like as in R-type like, is because
6752780	6756700	Last Resort was developed by former IRM staff members.
6756700	6761500	And IRM did, you guessed it, R-type.
6762300	6769260	Anyway, so you basically have to blast through five different stages twice and destroy the
6769260	6775100	end boss by aiming at their weak points.
6775740	6786700	So you have a cyber jet and then a robot drone that you can use as a shield and also as an
6786700	6792060	additional weapon with multi-fire and concussion launch capabilities.
6792060	6799820	The drone can be toggled to be in front or behind, and behind it can be a cyber jet that
6799820	6806380	can be upgraded with three types of firepower and faster jet speed by getting different
6806380	6807020	power-ups.
6808060	6811020	It's basically the R-9 from R-type.
6811020	6812220	I'm just going to say that right now.
6813180	6822540	So basically, the plot of it is that this computer virus has infected the primary computer
6822540	6830860	that runs the first space station, and so it's basically brought up its automated defensive.
6831900	6839580	And so now the computer is attacking Earth and you have to stop the computer by fighting
6840460	6842300	its drones and whatnot.
6843740	6851260	Anyway, it got really positive reviews from seven reviewers and Gamists in 1992.
6853740	6861500	Game Machine listed the game on their May 15, 1992, as the 13th most popular arcade
6861500	6862380	software at the time.
6863180	6867900	Replay also put it up pretty highly, very positive reviews overall.
6868540	6871420	And yes, lots of people comparing it to R-type.
6872060	6879500	And also, there have been visual comparisons to Akira, the film from 1988.
6881340	6884860	And I can definitely see it in some of the aspects.
6887420	6893180	It just really had some great qualities to it.
6893260	6906060	However, the AES conversion was pretty much turned down because of some slowdown and
6907500	6913100	shorter length, because, I mean, of course, the hardware was meant to handle the same
6913100	6914380	thing the arcades could.
6915180	6921020	But the graphics, the music two-player mode were all considered really great, but the
6921020	6926300	lack of also the additional stage and, of course, the slowdown still got further scores
6927340	6927740	lower.
6930220	6936060	One thing that was praised was the power-up system was a mixture of R-type and forgotten
6936060	6936540	worlds.
6937340	6942380	However, again, slowdown still, still, still.
6942380	6949340	And it was even being compared to the shooters on the Super Nintendo as far as the console
6949340	6949900	slowdown.
6955020	6961980	But I mean, overall, it was considered just a really, really visually stunning and audio
6961980	6963580	stunning game in the arcade version.
6964380	6966140	What is still popular.
6966780	6971900	We're also, I think there's, I've seen recent re-releases come out for it.
6972700	6980060	But as far as other versions, of course, we had the Neo Geo arcade, the MVS.
6980060	6983180	We've had the Neo Geo AES, which is the home one.
6983180	6985180	We've had the Neo Geo CD.
6986380	6991900	We've had SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 for PS2, PS Portable, and Wii.
6991900	6997260	And then ACA Neo Geo for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6997260	7006060	I also think that I got a thing through my Prime gaming account that it was one of the
7006060	7008060	SNK games they were giving out for free.
7008860	7016380	So, but yeah, I mean, it's really straightforward.
7016380	7024060	But I just thought that its notability was because of the way that it really portrayed
7024620	7034700	the sense of its lore through the environment and graphics, as well as having the benefit
7034700	7037580	of being by former Irem programmers.
7037580	7040780	And I think that's really where the R-Type influence comes in.
7040780	7046700	A little bit also like how it also did in Blazing Star and Polestar.
7046700	7049660	Another two of my favorite SNK shooters.
7050620	7054460	But yeah, it's Last Resort.
7055660	7056460	All right.
7056460	7057020	There it is.
7057020	7060060	Your classic game of the week, Last Resort.
7060060	7065420	I feel like I've put a quarter or two in this machine before, but I honestly had a hard
7065420	7066460	time recalling it.
7067100	7070940	But yeah, I definitely see a lot of what you're talking about.
7070940	7074540	A lot of the R-Type kind of similarities and things of that sort.
7075420	7080220	I think they had it for a hot minute back in the day at Crestview Lanes.
7081900	7083180	Oh God.
7083180	7084380	That takes me back.
7085100	7091580	But I know for a fact that it was, I think what took it over, because I knew they had
7091580	7094300	this for a long time, was Blazing Star.
7095980	7098940	Which I love Last Resort.
7098940	7100700	I think Blazing Star was more fun.
7101660	7106140	But I mean, I also would rather play R-Type.
7108220	7114460	So it just had that distinction of being like a marriage of titles.
7116380	7119420	But it's no less a good game.
7119420	7125340	And I think that if you've got Prime or you have other services that will allow you to
7125340	7127260	check out this game, you should totally do it.
7129100	7129820	It's a good one.
7130540	7136700	Yeah, obviously these Neo Geo games show up a lot on the Prime, and it's a good chance
7136700	7138540	to check them all out and take a walk down memory lane.
7141580	7145660	All right, well, let's talk quickly about some other headlines going on in the gaming
7145660	7148620	industry this week and some rapid fire news.
7148620	7149120	Loki.
7150140	7150640	Yep.
7151180	7156940	So I mean, with the movie right around the corner, the brand new Barbie movie, there
7156940	7164780	was a small announcement that the 1956 Chevrolet Barbie movie Corvette EV is going to be in
7164780	7166140	Forza Horizon five.
7166140	7167820	I love this for the record.
7167820	7175660	And they also have the 2022 GMC Barbie movie Hummer EV pickup as well that you can drive
7175660	7176160	around.
7177580	7178300	That's silly.
7179420	7179920	Awesome.
7180300	7180800	That's great.
7182140	7183980	And then let's see.
7184460	7191020	So Lies of P and Wong Lo have a partnership going on.
7191020	7198060	So I guess that's Wong Lo Fallen Destiny is the Tecmo or Koei, was it Tecmo Koei?
7198060	7199020	Koei Tecmo now?
7200860	7201360	Yeah.
7202220	7205020	So it's Koei Tecmo.
7205020	7206940	Yeah, it used to be Tecmo Koei back in the day.
7207100	7217100	Anyways, they're going to do a little bit of a crossover with during September, I guess.
7217100	7222460	And they haven't announced the details yet of what's going to be involved with that crossover,
7222460	7224700	but it is something that is coming.
7225580	7227420	So souls like combined.
7229900	7230540	All right.
7230540	7232620	I know a lot of people looking forward to that lies of P game.
7232620	7233660	I guess the demo was pretty good.
7233660	7234700	It does look interesting.
7234700	7236300	Yeah, it does look interesting.
7236300	7236940	Dark Sakura.
7238780	7239280	Yeah.
7239280	7244380	So anyone remember the toxic, the toxic Avenger?
7244380	7244940	Vaguely.
7244940	7245440	Yeah.
7245980	7249100	Remember that there was a cartoon called the toxic Crusaders?
7250220	7250720	Yes.
7251580	7257180	So it's the original TV series remastering is going to be on Steam.
7259180	7260540	The TV show?
7260540	7261100	The TV.
7261660	7270060	Well, actually they're going to do a scrolling brawler based off of the TV show, which honestly,
7270940	7275980	I barely tolerated the movies and I hated the cartoon, so I have zero interest in this,
7276700	7281500	but Hey, some people will absolutely love it and more power to them.
7284860	7285420	All right.
7285420	7288140	I guess you can always check that out in Steam and decide for yourself.
7289020	7295020	Um, lastly, Sunsoft is going to be doing a crowdfunding campaign through campfire.
7295660	7299100	That's more of a Japanese based website because these are definitely going to be
7299100	7300700	Japanese based games.
7300700	7304540	Uh, you know, Sunsoft, you might remember from games like blaster master Fester's quest.
7304540	7306860	We're not, we're not talking about these games, talking about, you know, games that
7306860	7311740	never came over here, uh, to the U S as far as I know, but now the blast master music
7311740	7312460	is stuck in my head.
7312460	7313020	Thanks, Rob.
7313020	7313260	Good.
7313260	7313820	You're welcome.
7313820	7314860	It's Hey, you know what?
7314860	7316300	That's great music to have stuck in your head.
7316300	7316780	You're welcome.
7318540	7322780	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
7322780	7322940	Okay.
7322940	7326140	Anyway, um, we're going to do for the rest of the episode.
7326140	7326860	Yeah, absolutely.
7326860	7328220	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
7328220	7334300	Uh, anyway, campfire crowdfunding campaign will be bringing three Famicom titles to switch
7334300	7338940	and PC via steam in celebration of the Famicom's 40th anniversary.
7338940	7343500	The crowdfunding campaign runs July 14th through August 31st.
7343500	7346220	The three titles that they're planning on porting.
7346220	7354860	Kanshaku, Tamanege, Kantaro, No Tuikaido, Goju-san Sugi, uh, the wings of, or excuse
7354860	7360460	me, the wing of medulla and ripple Island, which I don't think any of those were released
7360460	7360860	over here.
7360860	7362700	I don't recognize any of those names.
7362700	7366700	Um, but you know, sunsoft released a lot in Japan that he didn't put out over here.
7366700	7371980	Uh, they're also thinking about maybe doing a sunsoft branded golden cartridge that they
7371980	7374780	were not able to do back in the Famicom days.
7374780	7378860	Uh, only seven publishers back in the day were allowed to engrave their own brand names
7378860	7380460	on, on cartridges.
7380460	7384300	Sunsoft was one of them, but they were never able to do the gold cartridges because they
7384300	7385740	didn't have the budget for it.
7385740	7389100	So that's kind of interesting that they might do that after all this time.
7389100	7393260	But, um, yeah, if that's of interest to you, you'll have to get on a Japanese crowdfunding
7393260	7398060	website campfire and take a look for that sunsoft in mid July.
7398060	7403580	So anyway, um, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
7403580	7406620	of some games you'll be playing a little sooner than this rerelease.
7406620	7409020	What's coming out this week in the U S Loki?
7409020	7411980	Uh, we have charade maniacs.

7499180	7500060	And that is it.
7500940	7501180	All right.
7501180	7502540	We're going to travel over to Japan.
7502540	7503180	Bear with me.
7503180	7504140	It's a busy week.
7505020	7506700	What it is about this week, but we got a lot.

7551740	7555340	favorite movies, uh, but a different game that looks like it's probably based on an
7555340	7557660	anime, uh, Tokyo Xanadu.
7557660	7561100	Uh, we also have Ikaruga, uh, getting a multi-language release.

7702540	7707580	pirates of the Amchyridion, I guess.
7707580	7708380	Yeah.
7708380	7713980	Um, also Ben 10 power trip, a hotel Transylvania three monsters overboard.
7714540	7719260	Then Ben 10 and then transformers battlegrounds where apparently according to the cover,
7719260	7724700	they fight for a D 20 and then, um, troll hunters defenders of Arcadia.
7727100	7729100	I know it's the matrix, but it looks like a D 20.
7731660	7732160	All right.
7732780	7738460	Lots of games everywhere going into, uh, what will be here in the U S a long weekend for,
7738460	7740700	uh, many folks with the 4th of July.
7740700	7744620	I don't know why the rest of the world is so hopping, but yeah, there you go.
7744620	7745420	For reasons.
7745420	7745980	Yeah.
7745980	7749660	So I guess, you know, summertime, uh, you know, all right.
7749660	7754060	Uh, let's get into a few more stories and then we're going to open up discord for a
7754060	7758540	little bit and see if we can't get, um, some, uh, calls there on discord.
7758540	7760780	Uh, let's get to this story from Loki.
7761820	7762060	Yeah.
7762060	7766460	So I think it was last week or maybe the week before we talked about some of the content
7766460	7768380	being removed from grand theft auto online.
7768380	7774060	Well, there's also discrepancies between what is available for grand theft online between
7774060	7775660	console and PC.
7775660	7782940	And in fact, actually, uh, some of the content that is available on console doesn't get PC
7782940	7789340	ports, which is weird because you'd think there'd be parody when it comes to PC and
7789340	7795580	current gen consoles, but for whatever reason, for grand theft auto online, they just aren't
7795580	7796220	doing that.
7797020	7799580	Um, so that's strange.
7800380	7807260	They're saying that, of course, you know, um, with, you know, the, like some of the
7807260	7811180	different updates they've done with like the Vinewood car club and stuff like that.
7811740	7816540	Certain features are only accessible through GTA plus.
7817420	7824300	Um, which is of course that paid service that you can get through PlayStation or Xbox, but
7824300	7829180	GTA plus is not something that you can subscribe to on PC.
7829180	7833580	Probably because people rip all the content out and make it in a mod and stuff like that.
7833580	7837660	That's always been an issue with like rockstar games and porting stuff to PC anyways, because
7837660	7840620	they're worried that people will mod stuff in the game.
7841340	7842620	Which yes, they do that.
7842620	7847580	Um, maybe not grand theft auto online, but I mean, they probably still would do that
7847580	7847980	as well.
7848780	7856540	So there is a disparity between what they have on console versus PC, which is kind of
7856540	7857500	annoying.
7857500	7863580	So maybe there's, you know, that's leading to people to believe that maybe they're going
7863580	7866300	to be discontinuing PlayStation online for PC.
7867020	7871180	I don't think so because I think they make enough in shark cards to make up for that,
7871180	7876940	but it is weird to see some sort of like difference in content that's available for
7876940	7877260	both.
7882540	7886860	So, I mean, how, how mad are you about this?
7886860	7887980	Or is it not at all?
7887980	7889340	Because I don't play grand theft auto online.
7889340	7891980	You're like, you know, give a shit about grand theft auto online.
7891980	7892380	No, I know.
7892380	7897820	And I think a lot of it is, it's probably going back to, you know, how they're paywalling
7897820	7903020	stuff now behind that GTA plus, which is stupid anyways, because like, why?
7903020	7907500	Like you don't make billions of dollars off of shark cards already, which you do, because
7907500	7909340	we know that because you've said that.
7910140	7915340	But like on top of that, you want more recurring like revenue, like through these, the service.
7915340	7920060	And why don't you offer that service on, I mean, on console?
7920140	7922220	Because I are on PC as well.
7923420	7927580	Because I mean, a lot of the new models of cars wherever have already been available
7927580	7929340	in game, and then they took them out.
7929980	7934220	So this doesn't make any sense that like, you would just now all of a sudden hold that
7934220	7934620	back.
7934620	7938460	I mean, not that it would be impossible for somebody to rip that data out of like the
7938460	7943660	console version port at the PC, except probably easily a thing that's being done if it's
7943660	7945980	anything like four used to be.
7945980	7950540	Yeah, I don't know.
7950540	7954700	I don't really understand how Rockstar Games is operating.
7954700	7958940	I'm curious to see what they do with Grand Theft Auto six for sure.
7958940	7960620	Yeah, one of these years.
7962620	7966220	This probably this year, because they said they're making a lot of money next year.
7966780	7969740	A lot of money that's outside of Grand Theft Auto online.
7969740	7971500	So got to be it.
7972140	7972620	All right.
7974300	7975020	Let's move on.
7975020	7975740	Dark Sakura.
7977580	7981020	Well, Sonic stuff is happening.
7981020	7983820	And this picture of Lego Sonic is creepy.
7985500	7988940	So it's also Sonic the Hedgehog's 32nd anniversary.
7988940	7994700	And there was a 20-minute Sonic Central showcase to talk about stuff.
7995740	7999740	There is, of course, the 2D Sonic Superstars.
8000460	8008620	And there are Sonic Origins Plus, which is expanded version of the original Sonic Origins.
8009660	8012380	And it adds Amy Rose as a playable.
8012380	8018700	There's a Sonic Frontier, Sonic's Birthday Bash, a Roblox Sonic Speed Simulator,
8020060	8027180	Sonic Prime, which is an animated Netflix thing, mobile games getting some updates,
8027260	8034300	Samba de Amigo Party Central, Sonic Symphony, which is the touring orchestra.
8035340	8037100	I'm trying to see if it's going to be anywhere near us.
8037100	8039900	And that's just going to be Los Angeles on September 30th.
8039900	8045020	So, well, Tails Tube, which is a series about Tails being a VTuber.
8045020	8058540	And then also Lego has a trailer for Sonic Superstar.
8059260	8063260	So basically it's Sonic as a mini fig.
8065660	8066780	That's kind of cute.
8069340	8069820	Interesting.
8070700	8076460	As Jodhana Matt says, Sonic is 32, nearing its age for its first midlife crisis.
8076460	8080700	Yeah, that is nowhere near midlife anymore.
8080700	8081340	True, true.
8082380	8086140	That doesn't mean we don't have pre midlife crisis around that age.
8087020	8089020	I just have constant crises.
8089020	8093020	Yeah, I'm constantly in a state of all right.
8093020	8095180	I'm internally screaming all the time.
8095180	8096300	My soul is hoarse.
8097180	8099180	Uh, Loki, what do you got?
8099180	8100300	Your grief, I see.
8100300	8101020	Totally.
8101020	8108060	I did like, though, that one of the things that they did announce it at that whole Sonic
8108060	8110940	event thing was they had more Lego sets.
8111500	8115340	One of them is like some sort of like Eggman Sonic thing.
8115980	8117500	But you know what it looked like?
8117500	8118300	It was like ugly.
8119020	8120380	It looked like Ugly Sonic.
8121100	8122540	Ugly Sonic, the Lego set.
8122540	8124220	And I'm kind of all about that.
8124220	8127820	That is what freaked me out.
8127820	8129020	So I was looking at Fixie's name.
8129900	8131340	Yeah, I like that.
8131980	8135260	I will be checking that out when that comes into stores.
8137900	8139580	Anyways, let's talk about Roblox.
8141580	8143900	So Roblox, it's a game for kids.
8145020	8146620	Those kids are getting older.
8146620	8149420	I mean, my kids have been playing it for years now.
8149420	8150780	It's hard to believe.
8150780	8155500	And so now because their demographic is aging up, they're starting to look at, hey, you
8155500	8161180	know, maybe we should make content that's geared towards those kids that are now aged
8161180	8162620	past 17.
8162620	8167980	So they're saying right now that 17 to 24 year olds are the fastest growing group on
8167980	8168540	Roblox.
8170220	8173820	I'm just shocked because they're the group over 18 are playing that game.
8173820	8176700	Because they're the group that was 11 when this game first came out.
8176700	8179820	I mean, yeah, I guess there's literally people that have grown up with this game.
8180140	8181020	That's what it's about.
8182860	8185020	That's the cool thing for games to do nowadays.
8185020	8185420	You know what?
8185420	8188780	Final Fantasy, Death, F Word, Left and Right.
8188780	8189340	You know what?
8189340	8191580	Roblox, Full Frontal, if that's what they want to do.
8192540	8194620	Well, I don't know if they're going that far yet.
8194620	8196460	Maybe they'll be the next update.
8196460	8201740	But right now they're going to be they said right now they have their they're adding a
8201740	8203580	17 plus category.
8203580	8209900	And so right now they're 13 plus category may contain moderate violence, light realistic
8209900	8214860	blood, moderate crude humor and or unplayable gambling content.
8215580	8221580	17 plus category, though, will take it up with intense violence, heavy realistic blood,
8221580	8228220	moderate crude humor, romantic themes, unplayable gambling content and or the presence of alcohol.
8229420	8231340	Finally, Roblox sounds interesting.
8232140	8237580	But they said in order to get access to that, they're going to need you need to submit your
8237580	8239980	government ID.
8239980	8243740	Oh, forget you.
8244540	8247820	Like the fact I have a credit card should be enough to prove that I'm 18.
8247820	8248220	Right?
8248220	8252940	I mean, obviously, so many kids just take their parents, but still, I'm not I'm not
8252940	8257420	submitting anyone my government ID, besides the government.
8257420	8260620	Like, you don't need it.
8261500	8261820	Yeah.
8261820	8263020	Tojiki doll in chat.
8263020	8266140	Hi, by the way, says, Do they want my Social Security, too?
8266140	8270540	Like, honestly, can you read the last three on the back of the credit card and your blood
8270540	8270860	type?
8270860	8273020	And it's exhausting.
8274780	8281740	Yeah, I would just say just if you're going to Roblox and play mature rated games, you're
8281740	8283020	better off just try going.
8283580	8287100	Yeah, go literally anywhere else on the Internet and you can find because you have to you have
8287100	8291100	to understand a lot of these are still made by young developers and stuff.
8291100	8295020	And they're not necessarily full fledged games either.
8295020	8297580	So like, I don't know.
8298300	8302140	So it's just the Roblox F word experience where now they can get away with saying fuck
8302140	8303500	in a Roblox game, right?
8305820	8306540	Kind of.
8306540	8306780	Yeah.
8307420	8307660	All right.
8307660	8309500	Roblox gets its very own fuck show.
8310060	8310460	Love it.
8311100	8311580	All right.
8311580	8319660	Well, where Roblox opens its doors to keep on growing, one game is finally shutting down.
8319660	8320620	That's right.
8320700	8324540	One of the oldest MMOs, although actually, this game is so old.
8324540	8325820	Don't you mean a visual mud?
8325820	8329100	Yeah, it's well, if you didn't cut me off, I would have got there.
8329100	8336700	But yes, so it's more instead of an MMO, it's more what was a graphical interpretation of
8336700	8337260	MUD.
8337820	8343340	It's a game known as the Realm Online, and it's finally going to be shutting down after
8343340	8345980	27 years.
8345980	8350780	This game was launched in the 90s, and it's finally going to be closing.
8350780	8357500	And yeah, this game is where we got things like Ultima Online, EverQuest, and then obviously
8357500	8364060	those evolved into Final Fantasy 14 and wow, which will eventually evolve into the holodeck.
8364060	8367420	But yes, the Realm Online is kind of where it all started.
8367420	8370860	I can't really say because I mean, if you think about it's a graphical MUD, well, then
8370860	8373420	there were MUDs that inspired the Realm Online.
8374060	8379260	But if you don't know what like a MUD or a multi user dungeon is a lot because I used
8379260	8383900	to play a couple of these in college, many of them were text or they are really text
8383900	8385260	based or ASCII art.
8385260	8387660	Yeah, it was like as far as you could get with those.
8388460	8389980	But this took it a step further.
8390620	8394060	I think of BBS door games.
8394700	8400380	And when we first started to see clients, well, I remember the pit distinctly was the
8400380	8407260	one that had a graphical client then that you could launch to play the pit in the graphical
8407260	8410060	client like this is kind of like that for MUDs.
8410060	8414300	But anyway, this yeah, this game is very, very old.
8414300	8420060	And after all of this time, it was posted on the Realm Online forums on Wednesday, June
8420060	8423660	21st, that the shutdown will be occurring.
8423660	8427900	We are sad to inform you of a sudden and unexpected end to our journey together.
8427900	8433500	The current agreement we have with Norseman Games gives us no path to acquiring the IP.
8434300	8439340	This impedes our ability to direct more money into developing content of the game.
8439340	8443180	So the game servers will be shut down on June 30th.
8443820	8448540	So that's like that's about as much notice as Paramount Plus gave Queens of the Universe
8448540	8449660	and Star Trek Prodigy.
8450540	8458140	It's it's these are very fast polls, but also the financial year for many, many companies
8458140	8459420	starts July 1st.
8459420	8462620	And that's why this timing usually is what it is.
8462620	8465180	So very sad.
8465180	8467100	You have a few more days to check it out.
8467100	8472300	Otherwise, I guess it will live on in YouTube contents or it will just grow underground
8472300	8474380	as some of these things tend to do.
8474460	8479820	Hello, Phantasy Star Online blueburst and that sort of content.
8479820	8482380	So a lot of times these things have been going underground.
8482380	8489580	So all right, we are to the part of the show where we invite y'all to participate with
8489580	8496220	us via email via Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, and you can join our green
8496220	8496620	room.
8496620	8498220	I do see we have somebody waiting.
8498220	8499340	I just want to check real quick.
8499340	8503100	I don't think we have emails tonight, but I just want to check in and kind of ping that.
8505100	8506060	We had one.
8506060	8506620	Oh, we do.
8506620	8506860	Okay.
8506860	8507360	Yay.
8508060	8508460	Yeah.
8508460	8509980	And I need to call it out.
8509980	8512860	Thank you, fifth dream for sending me a picture of a cat.
8512860	8514140	Oh, yay.
8514140	8515580	Okay, that's right.
8515580	8517180	This is a picture of a cat.
8517180	8518220	Her name is Echo.
8518220	8520380	Her favorite video game is Stray, probably.
8522140	8523660	Echo has been downloaded.
8523660	8532700	And when I have more photos, ahem, people, then there will be an update to the cat preview.
8533020	8536460	And maybe other animals might be included.
8537020	8537420	Let's see.
8537420	8540220	I just wanted to make sure that I would love a ferret.
8540220	8548060	Um, we got this dreams cat a little bit of love there.
8548060	8549100	So there you go.
8549820	8550940	I don't want to beauty.
8550940	8552380	I want to boop the nose.
8552380	8554540	Yeah, that's a very boopable nose.
8554540	8557500	Sorry, I took that down real quick because I realized the background is still visible.
8557500	8561180	Now there's anything that protected in there, but I just yeah, you don't need to see how
8561180	8563180	many unread messages I keep in my email.
8563180	8566300	All right, um, let's move on.
8566300	8568380	Oh, I've seen your desktop, Rob.
8568380	8569180	I'm not surprised.
8570700	8571100	All right.
8571820	8572620	Excuse me.
8572620	8573820	We have a caller in the green room.
8573820	8575580	I would love to bring them on and have a chat.
8575580	8579260	So let's do just that and welcome them onto the show.
8579260	8581260	Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
8581260	8581760	Who's this?
8583100	8584940	Hi, it's your neighborhood Fixie.
8584940	8586060	Hey, Fixie.
8586060	8586860	How are you?
8586860	8590460	Fixation Gaze here on Twitch.television.
8590460	8591260	How are you today?
8592460	8593580	I'm doing fantastic.
8593580	8595180	I have finally gotten over my cough.
8595180	8597660	And so now I sound like a normal person again.
8597660	8599900	I'm really worried about you too.
8599900	8602140	I'm there with you a little bit.
8602140	8605420	I don't think I had what you had, but I've been sick for like the last three weeks.
8605420	8609580	I still cough every now and then, but it's finally like, finally, they gave me a stronger
8609580	8610860	antibiotic this week.
8610860	8613660	And it actually helped this time.
8613660	8614380	So it's nice.
8615580	8617740	Yeah, no, I had a really weird cough.
8617740	8621580	And then it turned into like an almost 104 temperature.
8621580	8623260	I just took some NyQuil, went to bed.
8623260	8625100	I don't have the insurance for that.
8625100	8626620	Oh, golly golly.
8626620	8627900	I'm doing much better now.
8628700	8633340	Today, I wanted to bring forth a bit of a philosophical question about video games
8633340	8634460	and the future of them.
8635020	8636140	Okay, go for it.
8637660	8644380	So with the rise of movies, you see like the Mario movie, the Sonic movies, which have
8644380	8649580	been questionably successful, even Dead by Daylight is throwing itself into the movie
8649580	8652540	ring with a Blumhouse movie coming out in the next few years.
8653180	8654380	Five Nights Around the Corner.
8654380	8656300	Yeah, lots, lots of this video game media.
8656300	8656800	Yeah.
8657740	8661260	I feel like there's going to be a renaissance that's going to happen that sort of happened
8661260	8666220	to the tabletop community when Stranger Things was like, cool, look, D&D is fun.
8666220	8669660	And it's going to be a big like, like, how do you think that's going to happen in the
8669660	8674300	way of like, normal, quote unquote, normal people who are not in the gamer lifestyle,
8674860	8678380	seeing games from a different perspective from the movie perspective, kind of like the
8678380	8683660	FNAF movie is going to do inevitably, and coming into these spaces, not really knowing
8683660	8688540	what's going on, and the amount of gatekeeping that is going to sadly happen, because it
8688540	8691740	seems that that's the way that this is going to kind of go.
8692300	8696140	Look what happened to the comic industry with all the new people wanting to catch up on
8696940	8702140	uh, Marvel storylines and how com- they're convoluted, okay?
8702140	8702640	Yeah.
8703500	8705740	It was happening, happening there.
8705740	8708780	And of course, oh, I've been a fan before the movies came out.
8708780	8713900	Yeah, it's a complicated question of what's going to happen when the gaming community
8713900	8717980	and the movie community are going to inevitably kind of mesh together.
8718860	8722380	Because sometimes you get really good stuff like the, you know, like, I will say the new
8722380	8728220	Mario movie is serviceable, it's okay, but movie critics hated it because it had no quote
8728220	8732460	unquote plot and was just a go to this place, go to this place, go to this place, but to
8732460	8735660	gamers who have grown up with Mario, that's a Mario game.
8736380	8739180	That is exactly what you do in a Mario game, except Peach is there.
8740940	8742860	So what do you think about that?
8742860	8747260	About the fact that quote unquote, like, normal people who have no idea what these games are
8747260	8751500	are about to be exposed to different kind of gaming things and exploding in that way.
8751500	8752860	You know, I'm stewing on this question.
8752860	8753900	This is a very good question.
8753900	8755260	I'm stewing on this a little bit.
8755260	8760860	And honestly, where my brain is going, is I actually feel like the video game industry
8760860	8763980	has already had to start responding to this.
8763980	8768700	And what I mean by that is, the video game industry has been forced in the last, I would
8768700	8773500	say, five, six years to, for lack of a better term, grow the fuck up.
8774620	8779180	And what I mean by that is a lot of what you saw that happened with the Me Too movement,
8779740	8783980	and how that ultimately started impacting the game industry, a lot of these horrible
8783980	8788540	things that we found out were happening inside game, you know, industry development, and
8788540	8794060	some of the work cultures, and some of the workers rights, all of that has been bubbling
8794060	8796060	up for the last few years.
8796060	8797100	We're not there yet.
8797100	8802300	We can't say, we have successfully conquered being an adult here in the video game industry.
8802300	8807420	But I think if you look at today, versus what things look like, you know, five, 10 years
8807420	8812300	ago, but even like five years ago, or just pre pandemic, quite honestly, I think you
8812300	8818380	go like, wow, things have shifted at a rapid or pace than it did in the beginnings of this
8818380	8818700	industry.
8818700	8823980	Because if you go way back to the beginning of this industry, let's be real, the Atari
8823980	8829580	2600, and the Atari development community, and I'm looping any, you know, old school
8829580	8833900	cartridge based company game in this was very much a boys club industry.
8833900	8837580	I do know there were absolutely important women that contributed but let's be real,
8837580	8838700	it was a boys club.
8838700	8844060	A lot of those old and not only was it that it was heavily drug influenced.
8844060	8848780	A lot of your favorite games were absolutely cocaine influenced.
8849820	8853900	Do you think that with the general public actually seeing gaming industry?
8853900	8855820	Do you think it would wisen them up?
8855820	8861420	Or do you think it would just basically be a whole bunch of like, no, no, no, I don't
8861420	8863420	want to really want to get into the game side of the community?
8863580	8868380	Do you think that the gaming community will actually have to like the gamers who are in
8868380	8868860	those games?
8868860	8872780	Because you always get your 12 year old cod lobby like stereotype.
8873900	8877820	Do you think this is going to change the way that normal like everyday nine to five people
8877820	8882220	who don't play video games are going to play or view video games because of the movies
8882220	8883020	that are coming out?
8883020	8884460	I think it's already happening.
8884460	8887180	Yeah, I think some of that shift is already happening.
8887180	8892860	But along with that, you just generally have more, you know, when we and I know you're
8892860	8897500	younger than we are fixie and but I'm not trying to get an age thing because when I'm
8897500	8901980	trying even when even when you were younger, but especially when we were younger, it really
8901980	8905180	seemed like oh my god, video games are such a niche thing.
8905180	8907180	It's a basement nerd thing.
8907180	8911100	Like you see Dungeons and Dragons portrayed in Stranger Things, which you brought up before
8911100	8912540	like that's how a lot of video is.
8912540	8914620	But now was like that in the 80s.
8914620	8915580	That's true.
8915580	8921740	But like I feel like really in this day and age, so many there's far less people that
8921740	8926460	don't play video games, then do play some kind of video game.
8926460	8929340	But you have to meet, you know, Tetris is a video game.
8929340	8931260	Pokemon Go is a video game.
8933180	8935660	Facebook games are video games.
8936380	8941100	I'm trying to think of other huge mobile titles that you know, wordscapes and word word with
8941100	8943180	friends are Candy Crush.
8943180	8944780	That's what I was trying to think of perfect.
8944780	8945660	Those are all games.
8945660	8951500	And because of that, the there are more women gamers than men because there are all different
8951660	8958540	because on planet Earth, there are 51% women and you know, men, birth assignment rates.
8959260	8966620	And so you just have more that play games than you did back in the 80s when it felt
8966620	8969420	like it was a social elite type of club.
8969420	8972540	So I don't know, I feel like in some ways I'm talking in circles, but I also just kind
8972540	8978860	of go like, there's just like the gaming industry, most people are already in it.
8978940	8980140	But I do get what you're saying.
8980140	8984300	There's also a fine line between like, because when you bring up like the Call of Duty lobbies
8984300	8986220	with the 12 year olds and all that, sure.
8986220	8991660	There's definitely a fine line between hardcore gaming and casual gaming.
8991660	8994540	Like there's still kind of some different camps there, right?
8994540	8996940	So does this cause more people to get into hardcore gaming?
8998060	9002620	I meet people in real life who think that video gaming is just like cod lobbies.
9002620	9005980	They don't actually understand that there's a skill or a talent into it.
9005980	9010460	They think it's just like your childish if you play video games and they refuse to change
9010460	9011260	that sort of thing.
9011260	9017260	But now with gaming becoming prevalent and becoming with like entertainment industry,
9017260	9022140	because gaming and streaming is moving towards the entertainment industry and a lot of people
9022140	9023900	are starting to notice that.
9023900	9028940	So it's going to become something a lot bigger than it is currently now, I think, especially
9028940	9032780	if more franchises are making TV shows and movies.
9033100	9037420	There's another thing to consider too, is that almost the reverse was happening.
9037980	9042220	That video games themselves were becoming more cinematic.
9043020	9047820	And so there was a greater expectation for more complicated stories, like the things
9047820	9050220	that you would see in a movie or a TV series.
9050780	9060860	So with that sort of, I'm going to say genre level crossover, that it's already a natural
9060860	9061420	progression.
9062140	9065500	It's going to happen whether people like it or not.
9065500	9070620	They're going to see this and they're not going to necessarily think, oh, this was a
9070620	9071420	video game thing.
9071420	9078060	I mean, there will be obvious ones, but they'll look at it and go, oh, it's an action movie.
9078860	9081500	You know, have that level of separation in their head.
9081500	9090620	I think, though, that since a lot of the older adults today now were growing up with
9090620	9093500	gaming, the mindset's there.
9093500	9101740	It's not going to be as underground as it was when we were all kids.
9101740	9107980	Yeah, I think gaming has, in a lot of where gaming goes, you just have to look to Hollywood
9107980	9111820	and where the rest of motion picture television industry has kind of gone.
9111820	9116620	I feel like gaming's walked a very similar path, but just kind of a few years behind.
9116620	9119100	I brought up the Me Too movement and its impact in gaming.
9119100	9121260	Well, that started as a Hollywood thing, right?
9121260	9124380	And we heard about all the horrific things that were happening with the casting couches,
9124380	9125100	et cetera, et cetera.
9125100	9127180	I won't get into it, but you all read it.
9127180	9137420	But I feel like gaming is walking down a very similar path as we accept as a consciousness,
9137820	9142700	as a social community, as we accept gaming more and more as an art form.
9144060	9145100	You know what I mean?
9145100	9150940	So it's interesting how gaming has kind of had to grow up along with that.
9150940	9159420	So yeah, but it's hard for me to picture like who that is that sees a movie and goes,
9159420	9163500	gosh, but I guess it would be like maybe the game that is based on that movie.
9164220	9166540	It should have happened with the Warcraft movie.
9166540	9171100	If the Warcraft movie had kind of landed bigger is that you would expect that there would be
9171100	9174860	people that would see the Warcraft movie and then want to go play World of Warcraft.
9174860	9177820	But was World of Warcraft very accessible at that time?
9177820	9181660	Or did it have a lot of edgelords that would yell at people trying to do looking for group
9181660	9182300	type of stuff?
9182940	9187820	But then maybe that's also part of the reason the movie bombed, except in China.
9187820	9191820	One of the other things that I also noticed was we kind of got a little bit of a setback
9191820	9195020	in the public eye when it came to the movie Ready Player One.
9196780	9201100	Yeah, they really botched that one.
9201100	9207260	Yeah, but I will say in like a response to Ready Player One, that Free Guy was a very
9207260	9213420	good movie to kind of be like, hey, look, a multiplayer game that's like GTA that actually
9214700	9219500	even though there's like the oh yeah, AI consciousness, this guy realizes he's in a game
9219500	9224380	and I kind of ignore that in the fact of like, they portray video games pretty good.
9224380	9227500	And then of course, they're like, Oh my God, yeah, Fortnite moment in Free Guy.
9227500	9231340	But it's a very beautiful story in that way.
9231340	9236060	And I think that might have been the kickoff to be like, okay, maybe gaming movies aren't
9236060	9236540	so bad.
9236540	9239900	And then you got your Sonic movie, and then you got your Mario movie.
9239900	9243980	That's it is that gaming movies were always the laughing stock of Hollywood.
9243980	9245340	They were always bad.
9245340	9246380	They were never good.
9247340	9251100	But even yeah, that's a Pikachu came out, though.
9251100	9254060	That was before Free Guy, was it?
9254060	9254540	Yes.
9254540	9258700	Okay, well, then I will take back my claim for Free Guy and say Pikachu move because
9258700	9259660	Detective Pikachu.
9260220	9262460	That is just masterpiece.
9262460	9262940	Hang it up.
9262940	9263580	That's beautiful.
9264140	9269980	I will even say, though, that perhaps it was the introduction of successful comic movies
9270540	9274940	that led to a natural progression toward video game movies.
9277340	9283020	Because I've seen I even though it's not a great movie, I still love the Dolph Lundgren
9283020	9283820	Punisher movie.
9284460	9287820	And I have seen the old Fantastic Four movie that never got released.
9287820	9290220	And it was better than advertised.
9291340	9292700	I will also come along.
9292700	9294060	I'm really scared of that.
9294780	9298300	I'm really scared of it becoming like the next comics of movies.
9298300	9300300	Like, because I love comic movies.
9300300	9301740	I will never say that I do not.
9301740	9305180	But I feel like we're getting a lot of it shoved down our throats in the way of turning
9305180	9306380	comics into content.
9307020	9308700	Yeah, it's it's as it's.
9310700	9311900	Sorry, continue.
9311900	9313180	No, no, no, I'm agreeing with you.
9313180	9313980	I'm agreeing with you.
9313980	9315100	Yeah, it's the same thing.
9315100	9319660	Although I also have certain things in that pick about the comic industry itself and what
9319660	9320780	they're doing with storylines.
9320780	9325100	But yeah, but I'm just scared that suddenly everything all the games that you want to
9325100	9330060	see, like instead of because the thing that happened specifically with like, also, oh
9330060	9331260	my God, what was that game?
9332140	9336220	Neighbor Hello Neighbor, that game that everyone is super excited about because it had a cool
9336220	9338780	premise and the game learned with you and it got harder to do.
9339340	9344380	They completely bombed it because the developers weren't focusing on the game and on the like,
9344380	9346860	getting it out of alpha and finishing it.
9346860	9351180	But with the book series and a TV series that wasn't about the game, but about the game
9351180	9352940	and franchising and movies.
9352940	9357500	And because they were so focused on what they were going to do after the game, they didn't
9357500	9358540	finish it properly.
9359100	9362380	And that's something I'm scared that developers are going to start to lean towards more as
9362380	9365980	they see big studios coming out with movies about their games.
9366620	9373020	The other thing that a point out is that this is already though, the model of having a game
9373020	9378380	and then bringing out a movie iteration of it was already successful in Japan.
9378380	9380380	I mean, most of the time it was animated.
9380380	9382700	I mean, how did they finish Danganronpa?
9382700	9383660	They did an anime.
9384220	9392300	You know, there were various live action versions of movies.
9392300	9395260	There was a Galgo 13 movie based off of a manga.
9396140	9397420	There were games based off of.
9397420	9398940	There were so many different things.
9398940	9404220	And then over here, we're finally starting to get why it works.
9404220	9410300	But of course, like we always do here and I say we collectively, we shove it down your
9410300	9411500	throat until you're sick of it.
9411820	9415580	You know, just milk it, milk it, milk it, milk it.
9415580	9418860	Pixie, you ask a great question that honestly could probably do a whole three hour show
9418860	9419820	on by itself.
9419820	9423420	But I think I've taken a lot of time on this one for you guys who are all good.
9423420	9427260	And but I think what's interesting, too, you know, we talk about, you know, the people
9427260	9428860	that see the movies that come to our community.
9428860	9432220	I think we have to remember and I think I'm really preaching to the choir here.
9432220	9434780	I don't think anyone listening to this program needs to hear it.
9434780	9437020	But I think this is a message we need to enforce.
9437020	9441420	And as many of us are content creators now and have our own communities, this is something
9441420	9443100	to reinforce in our own communities.
9443100	9447340	And that is the notion that gaming is for everyone.
9447340	9452060	And we shouldn't keep gaming because there is nothing to gain from that.
9452060	9457100	The diversity, the various viewpoints, the different opinions, they make gaming and they
9457100	9459180	make this industry better.
9459180	9461820	And they've continued to make this gaming industry better.
9461820	9464140	And they've elevated this as an art form.
9464140	9470140	So, you know, if you find somebody out there that is like, hey, I saw The Witcher movie
9470140	9473340	or sorry, excuse me, I saw The Witcher Netflix series, and it made me want to play The Witcher
9473340	9473820	game.
9473820	9475820	And now I'm asking for help on this forum.
9476460	9477900	Be nice to this person.
9477900	9481420	They're discovering this awesome game that maybe you knew a long time ago.
9481420	9483820	But again, I know none of you need to hear it.
9483820	9489340	But I think this is just those like tenants that we need to make sure that the cool people
9489340	9490700	in gaming are doing this.
9491580	9492780	We don't need gatekeepers.
9492780	9494060	The gates are open.
9494060	9494620	Exactly.
9494620	9496460	The gates have been open for such a long time.
9496460	9501020	And I don't want this to turn into like, the D&D thing where they got super mad that new
9501020	9502220	people were showing up.
9502220	9504460	Yeah, because it should be for everyone.
9504460	9506380	We are all gamers together.
9506380	9507100	Exactly.
9507100	9508380	They were newbies once too.
9509740	9515260	We all we all didn't loop our killer the first time we all bit dust.
9515260	9518620	We couldn't aim the first time we picked up a first person shooter.
9518620	9521820	So why bash on people learning and we're not safe.
9521820	9524860	That's even threw up the first time we played a first person game.
9524860	9527900	To go back to how people would try to discredit Dungeons and Dragons.
9527900	9531580	We're not Satan worshippers because that was a narrative they would put out there too.
9531580	9535420	And I used to tell my grandmother, I'm going out to sacrifice chickens.
9535420	9535820	Bye.
9535820	9536460	But guess what?
9536460	9536960	Guess what?
9537580	9542060	Instead of saying Satan worshippers, they say contributes to gun violence.
9542700	9543260	That's yep.
9543260	9546060	That is the Satan worshippers narrative under a different name.
9547340	9548060	Food for thought.
9549260	9549760	Yeah.
9550540	9551500	All right, Fixie.
9551500	9552300	I love the call.
9552300	9553020	Thank you so much.
9553020	9556700	I hope folks consider giving you a follow on the Twitch.
9556700	9560700	I'm sure you will be seen again on Dark Soccer's channel a little bit later.
9561420	9561900	At some point.
9561900	9562220	Oh, yeah.
9562220	9563580	Not tonight, then another night.
9563580	9564080	So.
9564620	9566380	And we may have a Jay.
9566380	9567100	Ooh, fun fun.
9567100	9568220	We may have a Shay.
9568220	9568700	All right.
9568700	9569900	Love you guys so much.
9570620	9572940	And happy birthday, Orange Lounge Radio.
9572940	9573260	Thanks.
9573260	9574060	I appreciate it.
9574060	9574700	Thank you for that.
9574700	9576060	We're gonna go do shots.
9576060	9576460	All right.
9576460	9577340	Take care, Fixie.
9577340	9578300	Yell yeah.
9578300	9578800	Bye.
9579500	9579740	All right.
9579740	9582620	Let's bring in one more caller here.
9582700	9583820	Who would like to call in?
9583820	9586060	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
9586060	9586940	Who's this?
9590220	9592780	It would help if I would unmute my own damn microphone.
9592780	9593260	It might.
9594460	9595100	Hey, Rama.
9595100	9595980	It's good to see you.
9595980	9596540	How are you?
9597740	9599020	Well, I'm good.
9599020	9599820	A little tired.
9599820	9602940	It's been quite interesting weekend, but you know how we do, you know.
9602940	9603340	Uh huh.
9603340	9603840	Uh huh.
9604780	9605420	What's on your mind?
9605420	9609980	Sorry, I don't have the way to juggle the cameras on the fly real quick for the four
9609980	9610300	shots.
9610300	9610780	So sorry.
9610780	9614140	Dark Soccer's Pig Meg will be off screen for just a moment while we talk to our buddy,
9614140	9615180	DJ Rama S.
9615180	9616620	But what's on your mind tonight?
9617580	9622780	Rama, somebody who does this with Skype on a regular, I understand.
9622780	9625980	Yeah, there's only so much I can do live.
9625980	9627420	So what's on your mind tonight?
9629020	9633580	A couple of things, but there's something we have to do first before anything else.
9634620	9636220	I was hoping it was this.
9636220	9637180	I know where you're going.
9637900	9640300	Orange Lounge Radio turned 21.
9640300	9641020	We did.
9641020	9642300	We're old enough to drink.
9643180	9650140	Well, that's why I have this big old container here that's equivalent to three smaller containers.
9650140	9652700	By the way, did you see that video of yourself earlier?
9652700	9654220	DJ Rama S with no gray hairs?
9655340	9656620	Yes, yes.
9657420	9661100	The young DJ Rama S Chronicles coming soon to Paramount Plus.
9661740	9663500	No, Paramount Plus has canceled everything.
9663500	9664140	I'm sorry to say.
9664780	9666220	Maybe you can get a deal with Pluto.
9667900	9670860	Well, they're owned by Paramount, so maybe.
9670860	9671360	Maybe.
9673180	9678300	I want to say there is an extended version of us dancing in the background.
9678300	9683340	It is a part of the caramel dancing sim file, part of Orange Lounge Revolution.
9683340	9683820	I remember.
9683820	9686540	See, I was trying to find that in the clip because I swear that was the thing.
9686540	9690700	But anyway, anyway, please, please do your birthday tribute if you wouldn't mind.
9690700	9695260	And I just want to stress for the viewers at home under the new Twitch guidelines and everything.
9695260	9701420	Of course, that is just simply Kool-Aid that is in that glass that DJ Rama S is holding.
9702300	9703660	Yes, of course.
9703660	9704540	It is Kool-Aid.
9705820	9708140	Kool-Aid for cool kids.
9708140	9710140	Yes, cool kids and mature people.
9710140	9710860	That's right.
9710860	9712940	Happy birthday to one and all.
9712940	9715020	Now, hopefully we'll see you all next year.
9716060	9716860	I hope so, too.
9717740	9721820	I hope you're enjoying your distilled wheat juice.
9722780	9723420	Absolutely.
9723420	9725820	I have something to wash it down with as well.
9725820	9731580	So which I think that label said Diet Coke, if I read that correctly.
9731580	9734060	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
9734060	9737100	In a brand in a new limited edition silver can with with.
9737100	9740060	Oh, that's the video is getting choppy.
9740060	9740940	I can't really see that.
9740940	9742620	Anyway, what's on your mind today, Rama?
9743340	9746620	Apologies is probably my machine because my machine is wrong.
9746620	9747420	I'm fucking with you.
9749420	9750620	Damn it, Rob.
9750620	9753260	See, I even wore our favorite shirt.
9753260	9753740	I know.
9753740	9758620	I was going to say the last time I saw you in person, I have an amazing picture of you
9758620	9759980	that's floating around Facebook.
9760780	9761340	That's you.
9761340	9763740	No, it's you eating a piece of cheesecake wearing that shirt.
9763740	9765020	It's one of my favorite pictures of you.
9765020	9769020	I've seen this when we were at one of those diners off Broadway.
9769980	9773180	Yes, we have to do that again.
9773180	9773740	We have.
9773740	9775340	I know we want to come back out.
9775340	9776380	Victoria does.
9776380	9777740	Melody would always be down.
9777740	9781660	It's just it's just a matter of when and money and time, et cetera.
9783500	9788300	Believe you me, I know now there's a couple of things that came up during the show.
9788300	9794780	But I want to touch base on now the whole Activision Blizzard King thing and Microsoft
9794780	9797580	saying, oh, we're throwing in the towel.
9797580	9801340	Everybody's laughing at Microsoft saying you couldn't hack it.
9801340	9802540	You couldn't handle it.
9803420	9808300	But that's how they're going to end up getting a BK because Microsoft says we're not the
9808300	9810940	number one Sony and Microsoft.
9810940	9813900	I mean, Sony and Nintendo is they've been kicking our butts.
9813900	9817500	So all we're trying to do is step our game up.
9817500	9818860	And that's how they're going to do it.
9818860	9819100	Yeah.
9819100	9822380	No, being coming off as the humble.
9822380	9824140	We're just trying to do our own thing here.
9824140	9829500	That's that's absolutely the narrative they want, because that's going to make it more
9829500	9832060	attractive, like, oh, what harm is it going to be if they get Activision?
9832140	9833420	They're not the biggest one in the room.
9833420	9838220	That's why Sony is trying to discredit Nintendo as a player in the same game, because
9838220	9840700	Nintendo, as we know, doesn't make expensive toys.
9840700	9841980	They just make fun toys.
9842700	9843100	Yeah.
9843100	9847340	So what Sony is the president where he's been flipping back and forth?
9847340	9848780	I hate to say it.
9848780	9856140	It's his ignorance is going to help be like basically the missing link from Microsoft
9856140	9856940	to win this.
9856940	9858140	That's the way I look at it.
9858140	9861180	Yeah, it's it's going to be interesting how this all plays out.
9861180	9868220	But, you know, we've been surprised in this before, so we can't assume anything is science
9868220	9869260	you'll deliver just yet.
9870620	9873100	And one more thing I want to touch base on.
9873100	9875020	I don't fully remember the full conversation.
9875020	9879420	I was running back and forth, you know, doing adult stuff, you know, you know, you know,
9879420	9880860	happens when you have to be an adult.
9880860	9887180	But you have mentioned about how you this PS five has become like your dominant console
9887180	9891420	and you move to Xbox downstairs as entertainment console and so forth.
9893340	9897900	My brother in Christ, I feel you on this right now.
9897900	9900140	My primary system is my Xbox.
9900140	9901500	Watch all of my stuff.
9901500	9902620	Play all of my games.
9903340	9911740	I haven't touched my PlayStation four in about six months, and I just re-upped my PlayStation
9911740	9913660	plus because I got it dirt cheap.
9913660	9918940	I have a stack of PlayStation games sitting back there, sealed, waiting to go.
9919580	9925340	And if I'm not on my console, I'm at this PC, you know, playing some games.
9925340	9929500	And I understand people are talking about how, you know, with game pass and the fact
9929500	9935580	that every Xbox game is going to be on the console and on the PC, you don't need an Xbox.
9935580	9938060	I'm like, I look at it this way.
9938060	9950860	I can either play, oh, halo at my PC, which is very powerful on my 27 inch, 2K screen
9951740	9953420	or and my computer chip.
9953420	9960860	Or I can go to the comfort of my bed and relax, play Halo on my 43 inch 4K screen.
9961980	9964860	And that's something some people do not understand.
9964860	9967420	Yes, I have a high powered gaming desktop.
9969020	9974140	The most powerful game that I play on here is Phantasy Star Online.
9975180	9981580	If it's not for that, the power behind the system is for multimedia, which some people
9981580	9982860	tend to forget.
9983500	9989100	So, you know, and it just it you bring up a good point that the right machine is really
9989100	9994780	dependent on, you know, let's not forget the series S, you know, in the conversation, that
9994780	9999980	is the right choice for gamers that are either on a budget or maybe just don't need the power
9999980	10003820	or don't have a 4K TV, which is still the case in some homes and so forth.
10003820	10006700	You know, they just that's what fits their needs right now.
10006700	10010140	It's just you get the setup that works for you.
10010140	10014860	And that's the importance of, you know, when Xbox and Microsoft talks about an ecosystem
10014860	10019260	and a gaming ecosystem, that's where they want to lead is, you know, have that system
10019260	10022620	through the cloud, through the series consoles, through the PC.
10023180	10025740	That's the game that Microsoft really wants to play.
10025740	10028460	And the game pass connects all of those things together.
10029260	10036060	And that's why no matter what, there will always be an Xbox system, whereas there will
10036060	10038220	always be a Microsoft Surface.
10038220	10044380	The Surface is there to show what Microsoft Windows can do in any type of environment,
10044380	10048220	whereas the Xbox always be here to show what Game Pass can do.
10048220	10052860	And honestly, I've seen tech YouTubers do this left and right.
10052860	10059500	They try to build a $500 PC that's just as potent as the Xbox.
10059500	10066780	The way things are now, honestly, just go get a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X and
10066780	10067980	call it a day.
10067980	10068620	All right.
10068620	10071820	I have already dropped $250 on memory.
10071820	10080780	I have dropped over $250 more on a brand new power supply and a brand new all in one
10080780	10081260	cooler.
10081260	10084540	I already dropped $400 on an RTX card.
10085500	10089180	I'm just saying just go with where it's good.
10089180	10089740	I get it.
10089740	10090620	I get it.
10090620	10090940	All right.
10090940	10093260	Well, Rama, it's after midnight on the East Coast.
10093260	10094140	We got to wrap up here.
10094140	10095740	We've had a long show tonight.
10095740	10097980	Do you have a final thought for our folks tonight before I let you go?
10097980	10102620	If you get the opportunity, go to Japan.
10102620	10103500	That's all I got to say.
10103500	10104700	I wish I'd love to.
10105580	10106540	I'm going.
10106540	10113180	I'm taking my passport appointment is Wednesday, and it's a done deal.
10113180	10113820	It's a done deal.
10113820	10115020	I'm going in December.
10115660	10116540	I'd love to meet you there.
10116540	10117340	I wish I could.
10117340	10117840	All right.
10118620	10123900	I'm getting the big enough suitcase, so I will see if I can have a layover in Sac
10123900	10124220	town.
10124220	10125100	You know, I got you.
10125100	10125500	All right.
10125500	10125900	All right.
10126380	10129260	Even if you have a layover in SF, that's not that far away.
10129260	10129820	You know that.
10129820	10131420	So let me know.
10132300	10133260	Most definitely.
10133260	10133900	I got you.
10133900	10134220	All right.
10134220	10134780	Love it.
10134780	10135340	All right.
10135340	10136540	Take care, Rama.
10136540	10137020	Thanks.
10137020	10138220	Thanks for the Kool Aid shot.
10138220	10138620	Take care.
10139340	10139820	All right.
10139820	10140300	Later.
10140300	10140800	Bye.
10141900	10142540	All right.
10142540	10144300	That was lovely.
10144300	10147260	DJ, thank you so much for giving us a call.
10147260	10150220	That is going to do it, though, for the almost said the Skype line.
10150220	10150940	You know, I've been doing it.
10150940	10153660	He brought up Skype during that call, and now my brain's like, oh, that's going to close
10153660	10153740	it.
10154460	10159100	That's going to close up Discord for tonight as we are here to wrap up here.
10159100	10161580	Real quick, Loki, last minute stories we want to put out there.
10162380	10164060	Yeah, just had one small thing.
10164060	10168140	So apparently it's like this just happened not that long ago, either.
10169980	10177100	There was a trailer for a I think it's for the new Destiny expansion, and it featured
10177100	10179420	someone else's fan art in there.
10180220	10180720	Whoops.
10180880	10181380	Jeez.
10182240	10187920	And so apparently, thankfully, the artist that made it was just like, well, that's cool,
10187920	10195200	you know, but Bungee said that we discovered that an internal or external vendor that helped
10195200	10197120	create this cut scene mistakenly.
10197120	10197760	Oh, I'm sorry.
10197760	10199040	It was in game is during a cut scene.
10199040	10203840	OK, so mistakenly used this art as reference, assuming it was official bungee artwork.
10203840	10208000	We are currently waiting to hear back from the artists to take necessary steps to remedy
10208000	10208720	the situation.
10209680	10213920	Good, so they're planning to compensate and credit them for their work and pay them in
10213920	10217760	like actual government currency artists what they're worth.
10217760	10223760	Yeah, not like in-game currencies, give them actual government legal tender currency.
10224320	10224820	All right.
10225520	10230640	Thank you all so much for downloading or listening to us live tonight on Twitch and so forth.
10230640	10233840	I just, you know, again, thank you for taking time out of your week, out of your Sunday
10233840	10236400	night to be here and participate along with the show.
10236400	10237680	We really appreciate you.
10237680	10240160	We wouldn't be here for 21 years if it wasn't for all of you.
10240160	10241840	And we just we really appreciate all of you.
10241840	10244560	Thank you so much for helping to make Orange Launch Radio possible.
10245200	10248480	If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, help us spread the spread the word.
10248480	10249280	Tell a friend or two.
10249280	10253680	A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify or wherever you found this show goes
10253680	10254960	an awful long way as well.
10257120	10259280	Support all of our personal endeavors as well.
10259280	10262080	We all of us either Twitch or YouTube or maybe even both.
10262800	10267520	So we really appreciate that as well if you consider taking that extra step as well.
10268480	10270720	That is going to do it for Orange Launch Radio tonight.
10270720	10274880	We'll be back in seven days, of course, to start off, I guess, what would technically
10274880	10277120	be our 22nd year in a way.
10277120	10279600	But yeah, it's a wild, wild.
10280560	10281680	Let's go around.
10282480	10284000	Why does this still say DJ Roma S?
10284000	10285840	See, this is why I shouldn't change shots on the fly.
10285840	10287040	It still says DJ Roma S down there.
10287040	10289040	Should we say Dark Sakura?
10289040	10292400	So if I could type.
10292400	10293680	So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.
10293680	10295360	My audio is going funky all of a sudden.
10295360	10295860	Who knew?
10296260	10300420	Well, before we lose you, then let's get your final thought for the night.
10301460	10306180	My final thought is stop camping, stop tunneling, learn how to play the fucking game.
10307780	10309380	And bring tiramisu.
10309380	10310900	It's the anniversary event after all.
10310900	10312020	Tiramisu.
10312020	10314180	I love that it's tiramisu.
10314900	10315460	It's great.
10315460	10316740	That just made me giddy.
10316740	10321780	Well, tiramisu is my favorite, my favorite dessert.
10321780	10322500	It's a good dessert.
10323380	10324100	All right.
10324100	10325460	Have fun with some Dead by Daylight.
10325460	10326340	I know you're off to go play.
10326980	10328180	I'll stay fog.
10328180	10328500	All right.
10328500	10329000	Bye.
10330100	10331300	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10332100	10337380	I'm just going to keep grinding my craft and hopefully we'll have some progress shots of
10337380	10338100	wooden pinball.
10339380	10339780	All right.
10339780	10340340	Sounds good.
10341380	10341860	Let's see.
10341860	10347300	My final thought for the night is I'm going to do, I'm doing this very last minute, but
10347300	10349460	tomorrow happens to be my actual birthday.
10349460	10352900	I don't want to make a big, big deal out of it, but I'm going to do a little bit of a
10352900	10353780	birthday stream.
10353780	10358020	I'm not going to beg for subs or anything like that, which I understand is I just want,
10358020	10359300	I honestly, I just want growth.
10359300	10360180	I want more followers.
10360180	10362260	I want, I want, you can pay me an exposure.
10362260	10362760	It's okay.
10363780	10365860	So I'm going to do just an impromptu birthday stream.
10365860	10367460	I'm not going to play 16.
10367460	10370900	I'm going to play games that don't have a heavy narrative tomorrow.
10370900	10373940	And I'm just going to cycle through some of the greatest hits that I've streamed over
10373940	10374580	the last year.
10374580	10380420	Things like Dead by Daylight, things, Diablo 4, No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy 14 Endgame
10380420	10381860	where there's no story.
10381860	10384820	And I'm just going to cycle through and try to do a really long stream tomorrow night.
10384820	10387220	So I can spend my birthday with y'all because what else am I going to do with a birthday
10387220	10387780	on a Monday?
10388420	10390660	So I hope you'll stop by and say hello.
10391700	10392740	That's, that's it.
10392740	10395060	Twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, if you want to do that.
10396900	10399620	Otherwise, that's it for me as well.
10400420	10401860	So that does it for Final Thoughts.
10401860	10403300	That does it for the show.
10403300	10407460	Thanks again for being here and making it a fantastic 21 years.
10407460	10408900	Shall we go for 21 more?
10411060	10411620	Baby steps.
10411620	10411940	All right.
10412820	10415700	No, in all seriousness, we will definitely see you again in seven days.
10415700	10416740	Have a good week, everybody.
10416740	10417620	We'll see you next time.
10417620	10418660	Happy gaming.
10418660	10422260	And remember, please, please, gaming is for everyone.
