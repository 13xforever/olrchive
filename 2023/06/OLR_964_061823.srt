Quote, General Manager, Rod Ferguson, We really wanted to ground Diablo 4 as much as possible. We've had some fun, but we wanted to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic, dark themes we had. End quote. There is no cow level. Also Diablo 4, for the low, low price of 100% of your daily sodium intake, you too can wield the Dread Pheasant Slayer or the Foul Reaper. This is the Gotta Get Paid update. Now it's time to get started.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our program for tonight, June the 18th of 2023. Not only did I mix up the numbers, but of course I mixed up the six and the nine. How nice. We love that here at Orange Sounds Radio. Please say hello to my co hosts with me here every week. I'm Rob Roberts, but they are DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi, how are you? I kind of heard a little bit right now. I had to go take something real quick. Oh, well, I hope you feel better.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,560
I had a lot of rest yesterday. So I might have pulled something on my side a little bit. But that's why drugs exist. Yes, yes. Everybody, medical science is not out to kill you.

5
00:01:40,560 --> 00:02:01,760
And as I was telling you before the show, I'm still not 100% from when I was sick after like Memorial Day. I'm still hanging on to a lot of that. So yes, Advil has been my friend, as has, you know, what is it just generic Sudafed or whatever. It's not I'm like, whatever top care is, I guess target or whatever brand that is.

6
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,880
Oh, boy. So you so you literally can't cry?

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:23,960
No, I cry too much. I either go from being like super dry and crusty to just tearing up really randomly. And we don't know what the cause of it was. It might have been related to allergy, pollen, something or the other. Could have happened when I was dealing with midness tooth.

8
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,120
Oh, interesting emergency dental surgery on the cat. Yeah, yeah.

9
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:43,120
The vet was like, okay, it came out. And she's like, we need to do extra. I mean, I can catch everyone up on Midna later, but it was just sick. Okay, well, that's how it worked. Yeah, cool.

10
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:52,880
All right, well, that's good. So now you can add dental surgeon to your resume. Let's see, ballet performer, dental surgeon, graphic artist,

11
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:05,280
videographer, part time killer in Dead by Daylight killer, sometimes survivor, Midnight Sun and cult leader.

12
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,680
All right. Well, speaking of cult leaders, help me also say hello to our other co host tonight, tech master, Loki.

13
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Hello.

14
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,080
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

15
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm pretty good.

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good. Okay. So every week, of course, we broadcast on Twitch over at twitch.tv slash vog network. That's VOG network, Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show. And if you watch us on Twitch, I mean, we are a podcast. But if you watch us on Twitch, you can see some of the fun things in our background sometimes, which includes what is this behind you tonight,

17
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,240
Loki? I don't recognize this and I feel like I should.

18
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:48,080
You should recognize it. It is a I don't even know if it's out yet. I think we just have a demo out for it. But it it is aptly appropriate that it's dad by the sword.

19
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh, okay. It's because little father's day tie in. I see what you're doing there. All right. Well, happy, happy day to you, Loki. Did did the kids do anything to spoil you today, Loki?

20
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,440
No.

21
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,760
Did they behave themselves for a change? That would be a nice treat, wouldn't it?

22
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,360
No, I'm just I'm just teasing.

23
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:21,320
Happy to you and all of the feline and other animal parents out there. And that I know it's a it's also a really hard day for a lot of people.

24
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,640
Sure.

25
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,520
Myself included.

26
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
Sure, of course.

27
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:45,320
So just if you need to, if you need to stay away from the paternal holiday, you are absolutely welcome to, you know, we understand. So for anyone who is remembering one or, or not, I should say, I hope you have a good Sunday.

28
00:04:45,480 --> 00:05:02,680
Yeah. And always an opportunity for me to say Happy Daddy's Day to all the daddies out there that I know and adore. So just, you know, and that has nothing to do with being a relative. Absolutely not. Let's see. Going to chat over at Twitch-

29
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,400
It involves leather and hair.

30
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:32,640
What? What? Of which I have neither right now. All right. Going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Jessica says my kids are animals, so I take both boxes. Well, happy day to you. And DJ Rama S is recommending or not recommending over the counter mucinex. It will knock you on your ass after the second dose. Yeah, I think that's a little stronger than what I need right now. Like I just still have like a lingering sore throat and sinus issues.

31
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:48,120
Honestly, mucinex is it's just an expectorant. Like, it's guafenecin, basically, which all that is, it's not going to like, make you hurt or make you sleepy unless it's got other stuff in it. It's literal guafenecin.

32
00:05:48,120 --> 00:06:00,480
But there there is like, there's different types like there is for anything. There's certain different types that will absolutely knock you on your butt. But it's like it's that mixed with like NyQuil or something or I always

33
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:11,120
I always just go get straight up guafenecin if I need it. But if you if you are not coughing anything, you do not need an expectorant.

34
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:34,840
All right. Let's see. We should move on and get into games. I hope for those of you that are sick out there, I hope you feel better soon, for what it's worth. All right. Let's get to the latest and greatest in gaming news. We had some more press events this week that we want to talk a little bit about the news with. Loki, did you want to talk about this or you want me to do it or what?

35
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:53,640
Okay, cool. So we have Ubisoft and Capcom. We because we got a lot of news last week, right? Because we had, you know, Xbox, we had summer game pass. So we had a lot of game announcements. I feel like we didn't get as much new stuff out of this as much as we got deeper dives. We did get some new things, though. I'll let Loki handle it from here.

36
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Yeah, some of the stuff we saw at the other events, especially for Xbox, you know, with the whole Star Wars outlaws thing, the reveal there. So we got a little bit of a deeper dive. They started off with

37
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:32,960
just dance. It's thankfully they kept it to like a very small, minimal showcase of people dancing. Like, does anyone give a crap about that? No, just say, Hey, you know what, it's another new year, we have a new just dance game. Here's some of the songs in it done. We don't need like a song and dance production over there. It's cringe. It's goddamn cringe all the time. Ubisoft get through your head.

38
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:43,480
I mean, I will say those games do sell or they wouldn't keep making them and they don't give me I get it. It's the over the top presentation. That's ridiculous. Like it's wasted money. Yeah,

39
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:54,680
like the the moms and kids that buy that game like aren't watching the Ubisoft forward. So nobody needs to see a song and dance to get hyped up about just dance because nobody is hyped up about just dance.

40
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,760
Yeah, show a 32nd commercial you plan to use before a movie or something, you know, like, that's the place where you advertise it.

41
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:29,520
Right, exactly. So like, I mean, it's fine. Unless you have like something really like unique, like this time is gonna be, you know, we're doing something different. But it's like, this time we have some more songs. It's the same thing again, but whatever. So we had the first look at Avatar frontiers of Pandora. So the first gameplay trailer from that very pretty looking game. I am not fully immersed in the Avatar universe. So it's alright.

42
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,840
But it's coming out this summer.

43
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,520
I was gonna say dark soccer, you were you were kind of into the Avatar stuff for a bit. I don't know if you still are, but I know you were for a bit. Is this something up your alley?

44
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I think so if it's something that expands more on like, I guess the the built in culture of their universe. I have a big love for things like conlangs as in constructed languages. And, and fictional sociology, if that makes sense.

45
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,280
Sure.

46
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:11,400
So it's, it's stuff like that interests me. If it's anything that actually is as rich of an environment as the movies are, then I'm pretty down for that.

47
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,040
Yeah, I mean,

48
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
I just care about the blue people.

49
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:45,280
Well, yeah, and there's something about Avatar and to be fair, I never did see the sequel. I mean, one of these days, I guess, but there's something about Avatar where at least the first one that the the world and everything about it did seem very, like fleshed out, like for all the budget that movie had, you really feel like, you know, they weren't just making a movie, they were building a world, you know, and that part of that was, you know, actually having linguists coming up with the language kind of as you're talking about, and you know, that there's this whole

50
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:57,400
backstory. So it actually lends itself evolving. Yeah, and it lends itself very well to a game universe. Although I do recall that original movie had some tie in games that were kind of meh. But

51
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,720
I played one that was on PS3, PS2.

52
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,200
Yeah.

53
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,280
Yeah.

54
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,040
Yeah, it was fun.

55
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:26,400
Yeah, so but I'm curious what to see what maybe like the next gen and maybe a different developer kind of does for that whole sort of universe. It definitely lends itself well to a video game. But it's, it's very rare that this these days, it feels like that a movie gets a good video game tie in. I'm not gonna say always, but it just seems very rare these days. So I'd be curious for sure. So

56
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:42,840
looking in chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network, tiger class pointing out if I had Disney Plus, I could watch it actually got rid of Disney Plus, I found I had too many subscription services. So I pared it down. The only one I have right now is Paramount Plus. I don't even have Netflix right now.

57
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:50,440
I have my Apple TV account and which Rob if you use the OLR account.

58
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,920
Oh, oh, then will that get me? Okay, cool. I'll have to look into that. I'd like to see the Tetris movie. So yeah.

59
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:11,080
Well, I don't have it there. But I bought Super Mario Brothers and dragons. I've got a bunch of old movies to like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and I've got Paris is Burning and, and a few cultural.

60
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, well, we're talking about movies we bought I have clue the movie I bought I bought I bought clue the movie on Apple, whatever, whatever store, like, God probably like 1015 years ago, because I always wanted that movie with me no matter where I go. That was my reasoning behind it.

61
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:52,440
Actually, coming to look at it, I also have a bunch of scary movies. I have Barbarella, Villain's Headface, the magic music, Birdcage, Battle Royale, lots of good stuff. But I have a lot. This is what I went through my horror movie things. So I've got like the cube movies, you know, Dark City, Dark Water, a bunch of Digimon. Oh, my God.

62
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:21,720
Dark Soccer, I buy eight men out Dark Soccer, I might need you to take me take me on a movie date because there's a there's a horror movie I want to see. But I don't know if it's something up your alley. I want to see the blackening. And the reason why I want to see that movie is because it looks like it's bringing something back to horror that's sorely been missed for a long time for me. And that's camp. Because just watching the trailer, it looks very, very camp. And that's the stuff that I love in horror movies. So take me on a date Dark

63
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,280
Soccer.

64
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,320
Okay, I mean, apparently everyone is saying it's hilarious.

65
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,280
That's it. I like horror movies that are funny. That's it.

66
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,720
And I like the font.

67
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:49,680
Yeah. All right. Anyway, where were we? Oh, yes, Avatar. I don't know how we got from Avatar to campy horror movies. But welcome to Orange Songs Radio. Anyway, low key.

68
00:12:49,680 --> 00:13:19,280
All right. So yeah, Avatar is going to basically be like Far Cry. And in the sense that you know, you have to take over outposts and all that fun stuff. So I don't know about radio towers in there yet didn't see those, but it's probably coming. We had a trailer for X defiant, which is coming out later this year. It's their PVP focus FPS game. And they're going to be doing some closed betas. They're going to be happening actually next week. So that's kind of neat.

69
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:34,080
They said that the release date for the game is going to be coming out later this summer. We got to see more of Prince of Persia The Lost Crown, which looks pretty cool. It's a that 2d action platformer game.

70
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,400
Trying to think of the last time I was hyped for a Prince of Persia game.

71
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,440
Yeah, I mean, it's it's

72
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,320
like, is it 1987? What's going on in here? But yeah, no, it looks great.

73
00:13:43,720 --> 00:14:13,120
Yeah, so that'll be coming out in January on the 18th. And then we had the reveal of Captain Laserhawk a blood dragon remix, which looks like Ubisoft's version of Captain N. But that's being done by I don't remember his name is like Ari something that who did like all those like fan project movies. Like they did I know the violent like Power Rangers thing. But they also were behind the Castlevania animated

74
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:28,480
series that was on Netflix. So could be cool. It's supposed to be a throwback to 90s anime and stuff. So I mean, I'll check it out. I liked Blood Dragon. Yeah, I wish it was a game, though. But you know, it's fine.

75
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:58,440
We had Division Resurgence, which is a spin off of the Division and that's coming in the fall. Again, showing Skull and Bones. Like how many years we're gonna see this? Is it ever going to come out? I don't know. And they did like a sea shanty on stage. Once again, we don't need stage productions of stuff, especially when Skull and Bones like when you're initially revealing it. Cool.

76
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:06,320
When you're revealing it for like the fifth time. Not so much. But there is going to be a closed beta for it coming out in August.

77
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:36,160
So I did want to go back to a comment that Bobby Blackwell had said about these over the top reveals. He was talking about Just Dance, but I would assume it applies here too. He said the over the top presentation gets press coverage in mainstream media. We criticize the song and dance number years ago for E3, yet it was all over MTV News. That portion of their presentation wasn't for the gaming media, it was for the mainstream media. Like I get the logic there. But I also kind of think what Loki says about when it's like the third or fourth time. Like I do, I absolutely

78
00:15:36,160 --> 00:16:00,640
remember, absolutely remember when Activision did this for DJ Hero. Remember that fucking concert they put on at Staples Center? It was like a bunch of A-listers. There was at least five A-listers that were performing at that event. What Bobby said, absolutely right. That was to get MTV News coverage and things everywhere else.

79
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:15,520
I just, you know, I think there is, you know, I get where Bobby's comments rooted in, but I think there's something about Loki too, when you're doing it for the 10th time, which, how many years have they done these Just Dance things? I don't know if it's as effective.

80
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:37,520
There's a new Madden coming out this year? Like, I didn't know. Like, I mean, it would be different if this was like the second game in the series. But they've been putting out games for that for like, ever. It's been out for a long time. So it's just, it doesn't seem like that's something like, oh, yeah, we put on the song and dance. So MTV would pick it up and play it or like some mainstream media.

81
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,040
Like ABC, CBS, it's that type of stuff.

82
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:36,200
That to demonstrate Just Dance and he'd be like, I've never done this before. Even though like, you know, it's been out for 20 plus years or whatever. Yeah, it's a big waste of time. But whatever, you know, Skull and Bones, they're gonna do a beta in, you know, August. Cool, maybe someday will come out. Maybe someday someone will care about it. But yeah, that's, you can always play Monkey Island, you know, the crossover with with their pirate game. So

83
00:17:37,520 --> 00:18:02,880
what else? We got an announcement. Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope getting DLC. I almost forgot that that game even existed. And oh my god, it's Rayman. He's going to be in the game. Cool. Then we had the crew motor fest, which is Ubisoft's I'm going to copy Forza Horizon game.

84
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:15,240
And last crew game I think did pretty well. Of course, they they kind of gave it away in a lot of those PlayStation Plus type promotions. But I feel like the crew did decently seems like so might have made some money on DLC to

85
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:33,880
Motorfest is supposed to be taking place in Hawaii. And it's kind of like Forza Horizon in that sense, lots of cars. It's gonna be out September 14. And apparently you also be able to import your car collection from the crew to if you happen to have played that game. So that's kind of neat.

86
00:18:45,240 --> 00:19:15,080
coming out on the meta quest two and three and not the PlayStation VR two. So that's interesting. And that one you it's kind of a spin off of the series, you get to play as Ezio, Cassandra and Connor. And you go through different scenarios with them. So kind of covering those three games. And then of course, they showed that Assassin's Creed codename jade is in closed beta. And they revealed that it's going to be a mobile spin off of

87
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:41,880
Assassin's Creed. So you can check that out. What else? Oh, Assassin's Creed Mirage. That's going to be the brand new game set in, I believe, like Baghdad. And it follows Basim. And they should like some more gameplay for that and stuff. So, you know, definitely like Arabian Nights vibe there, which looked kind of cool. But to me, I mean, they all look the same.

88
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:54,120
And then finally, we got gameplay of Star Wars outlaws. And they kind of talked about how that game of play and it looked pretty neat. So yeah, check that one out.

89
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:22,160
Lots of lots of solid games there. I mean, it's a lot of stuff where I don't know if I their day one purchases for me, but they're things like I feel like I'll pick up down the road to fill in the gaps. Like, you know, I was surprised how much I liked Assassin's Creed Odyssey, honestly. So I in fact, I wish I had more time to go back and play it more thoroughly. There's too damn many games this year. But I'll check out Mirage eventually. I find I like Assassin's Creed games more than I thought I would, or used to, I guess really.

90
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:52,000
And they did they did show a lot this year. There were some things I was kind of sad that were missing from there. I mean, obviously, Beyond Good and Evil to, you know, we didn't see anything for that. And, you know, the trailer covering the misogyny and misconduct of their employees by ease. Come on, that was missing from the showcase altogether as well. I'm kind of shocked, but you know, still not addressing it, I guess in 2023. That just doesn't happen. Go watch her go play or just dance

91
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,560
game. You know, that one. That's something that they don't want the mainstream media picking up on. But you know, it's fine.

92
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Okay. All right. Well, looking at chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG network, Quest Buster is kind of clarifying about Mirage. It is set in Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age. So, you know, those, excuse me, Assassin's Creed games often have pretty cool settings to them. And you get a lot of history out of them recently. Like that kind of started not with Odyssey, but the game before it. Origins, I feel like kind of started the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know

93
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:57,560
like, you know, the more like, you know, like, the like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, the more like, you know, the more like, you know the

94
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,080
originally I was like okay this is gonna be pretty grounded in reality and it's like

95
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:09,000
what we could also sell all this dlc that has really ridiculous stuff in it i do like money

96
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,640
let's do that all right let's talk about capcom uh capcom was one i actually didn't watch um

97
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,360
but we did have a breakdown of the showcase with that so they showed some more footage

98
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:29,960
of konnitsugami path of the goddess which looks very colorful and uh interesting so um that's

99
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,120
an action game running in the resident evil engine and we have uh megaman x dive

100
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:45,960
offline so it's a they said digital bank containing megaman x memories or there is a

101
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,800
digital bank contain megaman x memories as under attack and you have uh over 100 upgradeable

102
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,960
megaman characters to team up with in somehow save people i have no idea what the hell this is

103
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,080
but i like me some megaman x

104
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,160
resident evil 4 vr mode is coming to playstation 5 so they showed off some of that and so it's

105
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:17,800
going to be a more immersive version of the game and uh we had uh pragmata is uh being showcased

106
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,840
again and has been delayed i guess it's been a few years since we've seen this i didn't i

107
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,160
completely forgot about it but apparently they announced it back in 2020 okay the megaman game

108
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,600
did a little quick research on this this is just an offline version of what was a free to play

109
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:41,000
mobile game megaman dive uh it's going to be available on steam but it's also ios and android

110
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,400
so it's it's basically a mobile title so you know take that for what it is uh and then yeah there's

111
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,080
you know otherwise it does i mean it is you know kind of the side scrolly megaman you know x type

112
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:03,400
of gameplay but do keep in mind it was originally mobile for what it's worth um but yeah pragmata

113
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,240
looks cool i just don't know what it is and also don't know when it's coming out now so

114
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:14,440
i will worry about that closer to whenever its release is uh we have uh ghost trick phantom

115
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,720
detective the remaster getting a demo now so that's going to be out actually at the end of

116
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:28,440
this month on xbox one playstation 4 switch and pc and the demo i guess is available now so that's

117
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,280
kind of cool if you want to check that out uh paulo justice ace attorney trilogy was announced

118
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:41,320
uh it's going to be coming out early next year and also on most of the consoles and pc as well

119
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,200
so that's cool collection of the three ace attorney games there um oh yeah that's right

120
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,720
i sort of remember this a while back so capcom town was something i thought it was like they

121
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,960
said it's like a digital theme park i thought it was a website at one time um but it's something

122
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,160
that they still announced and uh talked about a little bit so it's like a thing that includes

123
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,760
a playable classic capcom games oh yeah this was linked in our discord it's really it's it's really

124
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,960
cool like um that you can play like the original mega man and you know rockman or whatever you can

125
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,080
you can play all that stuff which is cool i saw it was at street fighter 6 you can also play

126
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,640
like classic arcade games in there and stuff which is kind of cool because they were showing

127
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,440
i saw a video someone talking about it and like they're playing final fight in street fighter 6

128
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,360
that's pretty rad like i love when they throw in like free stuff like that that's pretty sweet

129
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,520
yeah capcom has usually been pretty good about their back catalog i mean every generation has

130
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,720
had like a capcom classics collection of some sort you know there's our capcom arcade collection on

131
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,840
the current gen which i never did get volume 2 did volume 2 even come out it had to have i think i

132
00:25:52,840 --> 00:26:00,200
never picked it up unfortunately but uh yeah pretty cool um we got uh some more information

133
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:07,640
on exo primal so it's going to be coming out july 14th and launching on consoles and pc

134
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,280
uh launching game pass day one and of course we saw during the xbox showcase there's the whole

135
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,680
crossover between that and street fighter 6 i'm not sure that's coming right at launch or that's

136
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:26,040
shortly after um but you know it's an interesting looking game i guess um and then finally uh they

137
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:33,560
ended with dragons dogma 2 which i know is highly anticipated of course and looks pretty sweet nice

138
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,240
no word on when that is coming out uh let me get to some comments over twitch.tv slash vog network

139
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,680
yyr hello hello says uh about the mega man game it's at least nice that capcom is giving folks

140
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,960
a way to play that mobile mega man game after it shuts down yeah that's a good point you know there

141
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,400
are you know as much as i sometimes you know in mobile games there are some that have really big

142
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,160
followings um you know that would probably appreciate an offline game i think about like

143
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,160
gergalia lost and you know there was that game definitely had its fans and you know

144
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:10,120
obviously when it shut down that was sad so i i will appreciate capcom uh you know making that

145
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,160
type of forever version of the game available when they plan to shut it down not every developer

146
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:20,840
does that so um you know props to them uh many people talking about like the classic uh stuff

147
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,040
there um and dr c says the classic stuff in street fighter 6 is in the arcade when you go

148
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,440
online you can sit in a machine to play other people or there's another section elsewhere with

149
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:36,120
different capcom classic arcades that rotate every so often uh fifth dream says legendary

150
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,320
wings if you do the season pass thing so that's pretty cool i didn't realize that man i just

151
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,600
i have missed street fighter 6 if this was any other year those words would not be leaving my

152
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:54,040
mouth but it's it's a busy year we're catching up in 2023 from all these uh lockdown era you know

153
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,040
we're we're really getting i think the results of um lockdown production this year um this is very

154
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,840
very interesting to see just a lot of stuff coming in street fighter 6 is one of many uh games that

155
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:13,000
people very excited uh this summer all right well if that is it for capcom then i think we can take

156
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,320
a break from gaming news and talk a little bit about our gaming weeks because usually at the top

157
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,560
of the show we like to take a minute to ask the question how is your gaming week and talk about

158
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,920
the types of games that we've been playing this week so dark soccer i'll go to you how was your

159
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:33,720
gaming week it was all right um i played pinball lots of uh black knight and world cup um sort of

160
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:43,160
rage specifically for black knight um oh and had hiccups apparently um played uh some midnight suns

161
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:52,200
i played some dead by daylight played cult of the lamb um i'm still in that stupid wordscapes game

162
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:59,240
i like it it makes my my brain actually have to work for a little bit and otherwise i've been

163
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,120
just playing whatever comes in front of me how are you liking that new killer they released in

164
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,880
dead by daylight this week i haven't played it yet but i um adapted gabriel the first day

165
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:21,160
um we actually uh hold on sorry we actually um had a nice uh singularity who was just wandering

166
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,840
around apparently i was the chosen one you know what it is when you are the chosen one you live

167
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:36,120
you live everyone dies yeah and uh so we wandered around together and he shot me with little orbs

168
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:42,680
and i actually learned something though about the killer um thanks to one of mid skulls videos

169
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,440
where um the boost that he gets for having one of those little globs on people

170
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:58,120
increases per glob per person so it's oh i didn't know that oh wow it adds another like amount on

171
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,120
there and it's not in any of the official documentation but he tested it i don't know

172
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,760
if it's intended i don't know if it's gonna get patched out but um but otherwise i've also been

173
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,960
getting the legacy uh anniversary items just by logging in so although i forgot to log in yesterday

174
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,760
all right so i've got like the fourth anniversary shirt for claudette and

175
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:28,200
some other character stuff all right cool and i finally got my own wrecker uh a wraith outfit

176
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:36,840
nice yeah all right now i'm special we'll go to loki how was your game week um i just played

177
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,800
minecraft because i'm still working on minecraft stuff um i should have a new episode out tonight

178
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,400
or tomorrow morning because i'm editing it right now so it's all done built lots of stuff lots of

179
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,880
things um i did watch uh some of my serve mates playing a game on steam though called one arm

180
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,240
chef that looks pretty funny um it's a cooking game where you basically have to go around and

181
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,920
prepare things but it's one of those ones with like awkward controls that you have to like

182
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,280
pick up stuff carefully with your hand and do things but it looks like a lot of fun and it's

183
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,880
pretty chaotic it's kind of like that uh ready set cook but first person and you know with one arm

184
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:24,200
okay so i recommend it good party game all right uh fc100 matt says i really thought that mega man

185
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,040
minecraft stuff would be shown at the capcom show but it didn't uh no that's the thing they they

186
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,200
completely have forgotten about the whole contest they've already they've already started another

187
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:41,160
contest and i i will literally i vow i will bring it up every goddamn month on the 15th every single

188
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,400
month until they address it there you go it's still your discord get them it's just a locked

189
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,960
discord but like it's like well after the time that they would have advertised they already

190
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,720
started a new feature me minecraft like contest thing but now they're like reframing it though so

191
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,680
like before it used to be like oh yeah we're gonna announce winners now it's like oh yeah tag this to

192
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,880
be to have a chance to be featured on our site they don't like say oh we're gonna like do you

193
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,600
know winners it's just like oh we like your thing maybe we'll put it on our website so i don't know

194
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,840
but yeah they're irritating me at the very least like they said they would do it and there were

195
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:25,240
no entries i'm like okay you know no no worthy entries except for mine where's my shout out give

196
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,000
loki a shout out come on minecraft it's like it's never gonna happen it's too late that windows pass

197
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,960
now they're moving on to what was the new one that they had just uh recently that they did um

198
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:43,240
like a minecraft thing for it was um it's like some other like not that just the dragons because

199
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,000
they just have that too i don't know there's some other like animated series thing that they made

200
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,400
minecraft stuff where they just move it moved on so quickly so who knows all right all right well

201
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,680
my gaming week um been pretty predictable for most of you out there uh still continuing final fantasy

202
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,560
14 there was some new uh raids that were released uh in the last patch i finally got around to doing

203
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,600
those after shane nagged me enough to do them i was like okay sure i'll do them um and then

204
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:17,000
i've been playing diablo 4 as well uh continuing my progression there i'm level 54 now and i've

205
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
been experiencing some of the different stuff that world tier 3 has like the helltide events

206
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,560
and you know kind of pushing my way through some of the dungeons um so yeah i've been having fun

207
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,680
there i haven't been doing as much multiplayer as i was kind of hoping to do but um because i joined

208
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:37,160
a clan in the first couple days uh with one of my streamer buddies but um i i kind of get the

209
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,880
sense they've already moved on from diablo so i got to kind of look for maybe another group to join

210
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,520
uh see what to do there but um yeah otherwise uh i am enjoying still diablo 4 and you know there's

211
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,400
something very zen about clicking a bunch and uh you know slaying all those demons from hell it's

212
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,880
a lot of fun i'm playing a tornado druid for those that are curious um i will probably at some point

213
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,320
roll a hardcore character just to kind of say i did it and went through that progression

214
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:11,080
but with fall fantasy 16 out this week i just don't see that happening until probably season

215
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,360
one is when i'll get around to doing a hardcore run at some point uh speaking of fall fantasy 16

216
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,240
the much anticipated demo came out this week so i actually played that i did that on stream

217
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:29,320
uh this week and uh it was um it was quite the demo um i had used a comparison

218
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,560
that it was basically like episode one of a series and that's what it really felt like um it was

219
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:42,440
interesting because you had the two-hour prologue demo which had some combat in it it had like the

220
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,880
first little area in it and the tutorials but it didn't have a lot it was much more story-based but

221
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,120
i get it they were trying to you know set up the story and why things are the way they are and

222
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,320
this very very intricate flashback sequence i don't want to ruin it for those that haven't seen

223
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,440
it yet but it was it was very interesting um it was just basically like a playable episode of a tv

224
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,760
show and then there was a combat demo so after you beat the prologue demo you get like a 30-45

225
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,760
minute combat demo that takes you through a later dungeon in the game where you ultimately go up

226
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,080
against Garuda i mean it's in the demo um and you uh it kind of lets you experience a little

227
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:27,560
more advanced combat so you can see how the accessory rings can really simplify combat

228
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,960
and literally make it push x to win if that's what you want to play which you know no judgment

229
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,200
play the game you want to play another mode or you can have no assists and you have to dodge

230
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,720
everything manually and do this but i will say weaving in and out the icon ability like being

231
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,760
able to do like i kept saying falcon punch because titan has this giant rock fist that

232
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,840
goes like being able to weave in falcon punch and then like do garuda's claw move that's like a

233
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,400
bunch of rapid hits like being able to weave all that stuff in and out is really satisfying i will

234
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,760
say you know for all the apprehension people have about the action-based combat when the last time

235
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,760
final fantasy had turn-based combat truly was final fantasy 10 some might argue 13 was kind

236
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,600
of turn-based i don't think it was i think it was probably the closest uh we've had to that but um

237
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,640
i the action in 16 way better than 15 because i actually felt like i knew what the hell i was

238
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,200
doing and what was going on whereas in 15 as much as i was fine with 15 and i enjoyed my time with

239
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,000
the game i i did enjoy it enough where i i felt motivated to go through all the dlc but i enjoyed

240
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,400
the time enough of the game i felt like in 16 i was in control even though i was using the assist

241
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,240
to slow down the dodge so the only ring i used was the one where if an attack is incoming

242
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,640
a little ring comes up goes tick tick tick tick tick tick and you have that amount of time to dodge

243
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,840
so it helps you understand the dodge time frames better and it was great that was that was perfect

244
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,400
for me because it made it feel like i was in control but that i wasn't getting overwhelmed

245
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:07,800
with attacks either that i could i could still dodge attacks so um going to chat comments

246
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,960
sg100 matt says yeah that's got to be the most generous demo when rob streamed it he got three

247
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,280
hours worth of demo yeah because i also played about 45 minutes of theater them that night

248
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,120
and i think my stream was about three hours and 45 minutes uh when i was set and done because um

249
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,040
chrono uh chrono trigger part two music came out last thursday and i just got around to it this

250
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,520
week scar of time is finally available in uh theater rhythm and it's it's exactly everything

251
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:41,000
you were hoping for because that song is fantastic and our old credit music um is in there as well the

252
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,160
the little um do do two westerly wins or does it yeah far away that's it that that song is in there

253
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,520
as well but the original version not the the remix that was in there um questmaster says the icon

254
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,440
combat took a bit of getting used to for me but by the end of my time with it i was juggling

255
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,880
through the icon abilities to burst the boss down yeah same uh questmaster says your progress in the

256
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,680
demo will also carry over to the full game so there's also that yes and um it's interesting

257
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,440
because again i don't want to spoil too much of the demo for those who haven't seen it yet

258
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:22,840
but it does seem that point where the demo cuts off is very like definitive like they don't have

259
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,640
to carry over a bunch of data i'll just say it's a flashback so it's not like they have to carry

260
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,120
over a bunch of data into the live game because it's like here's a point where now you can pick

261
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:37,960
it up and go i think it's going to work a lot better than again 15 but remember 15 had that

262
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:43,480
movie kingslayer or whatever it was called nobody watched it and it will somebody i'm going to get

263
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,200
that email i watched it you're really ignorant okay i didn't watch it a lot of people i know

264
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,120
that played 15 didn't watch it because you know you put in the game you want to get going you

265
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:58,760
don't have to want to watch a two-hour prerequisite movie to do it so 16 kind of you know stepped it

266
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,880
up a little bit uh better there so all right um bobby blackwolf watched it of course i knew

267
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,680
somebody would say that i watched it but at least this one had playable sequences in it uh uh for

268
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:18,600
what it's worth and gave you and i did not even notice this until i saw a tweet about it earlier

269
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:25,720
but in that first area you play in the demo the little mobs you fight are little goblins

270
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,880
which okay but it's a throwback to the very first final fantasy those little goblins are the mobs

271
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,400
you fight right outside the original town so there's there's interesting tie-ins to the other

272
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,920
final fantasy games because there's a very very overt final fantasy 4 reference early on too

273
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,320
and uh it's but a lot of these things are like blink and you miss it types of things somebody

274
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:56,200
caught a final fantasy 10 reference that's really deep like it is literally the inflection of a

275
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,200
whistle that's given in the in the demo is mirroring what una does towards the end of

276
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,640
final fantasy 10 and like they did like the side by side and i was like dang those are some deep

277
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:14,120
ass cuts the other thing i'll say about final fantasy 16 though very clear from the very

278
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,880
beginning from the opening sequences of the game in the first 10 minutes this is an adult final

279
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:28,200
fantasy game with adult themes four letter words murder blood is all there very early on so the

280
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:35,640
whole game of chocobos a song of shiva and ifrit all of that appropriate to describe what's going

281
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,520
on in this particular game um that probably isn't going to sit well with some people because even

282
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,800
you know y'all know i don't love violence and i wasn't prepared for watching people get their

283
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,080
throat slit in the game that's that's something that happens and uh what i really was not prepared

284
00:40:51,080 --> 00:41:00,680
for was chocobo violence and i was like okay i was not mentally prepared for that but here we are

285
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:07,560
so this demo definitely setting up m rating bolded underlined italicized

286
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:14,920
so there it is for some people they'll be they'll be thrilled to hear it but it's definitely it's

287
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,680
definitely going to be a different mindset for approaching a final fantasy game than some of

288
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,320
the previous final fantasy games i did enjoy it though like i you know as far as like taking the

289
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,720
episode one of a series approach it was definitely one of those things where it was like when it was

290
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:35,560
done it was like i'm ready to binge the rest you got me let's do it let's do it so but luckily

291
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:42,040
it's not a six-month wait it's a 10-day wait so they did a lot of things uh very well with

292
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,400
the demo we'll have to check it out i it's probably one i'm gonna have to pick up yeah

293
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,840
i didn't really care for 15 i got so bored at 15 i didn't like the switch up on like the action

294
00:41:52,840 --> 00:42:00,360
combat but it's this has as much in common with 15 as 15 did with 13 like you know they're just

295
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,680
they're all separate and again the adult themes are really going to separate this one for sure

296
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:14,360
so uh yyr says has there ever been a final fantasy with an mm rating before i don't think so um but

297
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:19,320
i don't think there's ever been a final fantasy game with a quote that is fuck fuck fuck fuck

298
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,400
fuck fuck fuck fuck that is literally one of the lines of dialogue that's in the demo

299
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,760
granted they're running from a giant rock falling from the sky but that was a line in the demo do

300
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,880
you remember when you played are they sharing writers of the saint's row game i mean like it

301
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,360
sounds really bad do you remember it's actually it's it's extremely well acted and all that it's

302
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,520
it's it's but it's just like again you have to be kind of mentally prepared for it and the

303
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,120
demo sets the stage for that but do you remember when you played final fantasy 7 for the very first

304
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:57,800
time and in the opening intro section of the game uh barrett says shit and it's the first time

305
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,960
there's like a four-letter word that most people had seen in a video game i mean you may have seen

306
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:09,560
one but yeah okay imagine that like over and over and over again like you're like like because

307
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,160
remember when the first time you saw barrett say shit it was like oh edgy okay that was like the

308
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:23,080
final fantasy 16 demo was every scene oh oh oh oh there is the best line stitch your ass down in

309
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:32,840
that chair and drink your goddamn tea a line i still use to this day well you know you spoonie

310
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:39,880
barred one of the most epic like mistranslations yeah it was you son of a bitch in the original

311
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:49,240
yeah although that i i not quite what it originally was but yeah saying but it was the

312
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,560
closest translation exactly exactly uh dgrms says so does the final fantasy 16 demo need a fuck

313
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,720
counter uh probably probably it's uh the f word is going to be used very heavily in the game for

314
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:09,960
sure um i i i still i realize there's still a lot of um you know valid concerns about the diversity

315
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,000
in the game i get it i will say one thing i thought was interesting about the demo and

316
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,240
something you learned about the story and again i'm not going to excuse it but i will say i had a

317
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:26,440
oh moment with this the demo gets into the fact that there are people that have tattoos that are

318
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,360
like branded by icons or something i don't remember the specifics of it i'll let you play

319
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,800
the demo to find out but those people it's a very classist society and they actually use the term

320
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:44,280
enslaved to describe those people and so i was like okay there's an optic thing here that they

321
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,280
wanted to avoid i think there's still ways they could have got around it but there was a part of

322
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,320
me that was like i you know when i kind of heard that and i saw that i was like ah okay well i i

323
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,480
see what they were trying to avoid for better or for worse uh with some really bad optics in the

324
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,080
game um so again i'd like to kind of experience the whole game to sort of put my head together

325
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:13,560
on all that wrap my head around it um but that would i would just say that was something that

326
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,480
when it was revealed in the game that that was like a subplot basically i was like oh interesting

327
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,720
um uh also uh bobby also brings up a very interesting point and i've never heard this

328
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:30,440
before the final fantasy game and this is very interesting apparently when japanese folks played

329
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:38,120
the demo there was a complaint the lips don't sync up with the vocals which is interesting

330
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,000
because that's a complaint we've had for a long time the response from the developers the japanese

331
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,240
developers was the game was designed for english as the as basically the primary language so now

332
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:56,680
japanese players are experiencing what we've had forever with final fantasy games so

333
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:05,400
i i guess this whole european they're they're they are tying themselves to that that mountain

334
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,320
for what it's worth um so again i'd like to see the rest of the artistic choices in the game

335
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:18,280
um i hear you know again i'm trying to avoid spoilers but i hear the adult themes and some

336
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,920
dark adult themes don't stop with what's just seen in the demo and that's about all i'm gonna say

337
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,640
uh i'm curious to see i mean there's a lot of tv shows there's a lot of movies i watch that

338
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:37,640
have some very dark adult themes um i'm curious to see where it goes but um until i have a chance

339
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:45,000
to play the game start to finish we'll see we'll see um yeah bobby blackwolf says they even said

340
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,800
that the script was written in english first and then translated to japanese yeah and mike deft

341
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,520
points out they killed chocobos in the demo they absolutely do and it was one of those things where

342
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:01,880
i i wasn't prepared for that because again it's like the golden rule you don't kill a chocobo

343
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,560
right and it's it's one of those things where like in movies i'm like you know i don't love violence

344
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,880
but i don't particularly care if people get killed left and right and all this stuff i i get used to

345
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:17,240
it but the minute they show a cat in distressed i'm rolling up my sleeves ready to fight

346
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:28,840
yeah that's when i was watching uh the the autopsy of jane doe i was like no no and it's probably why

347
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,800
to this day drag me to hell is one of my least favorite movies ever yeah or stranger things

348
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,840
season three as much as i appreciate that shows strangers things there was that scene and i was

349
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:46,440
like oh oh no no no no the scene in shape of water that one didn't get me either yeah anyway

350
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,000
all right it was very quick and off camera so so that game is out god what thursday it's out very

351
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,040
soon it's 22nd so i'm not getting it digital i did end up getting a retail version of it

352
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,560
so i have to go run at lunch time to best buy and pick it up because i don't trust

353
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,080
a delivery service to deliver it on time so i decided i would just go pick it up at a mass

354
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,960
retailer at noon so i can go do it on my time uh and then i'll be ready to play after work so

355
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,040
that's between diablo 4 and final fantasy 16 that's going to be my next 30 days of gaming at

356
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:24,280
least so if you think loki talking about minecraft is a lot just wait just wait for me in these two

357
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:31,400
games all right moving on let's get into some gaming news and other things going on throughout

358
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:39,560
the industry this week so loki yeah so we've got news that the ftc is going to be temporarily

359
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:50,520
stopping or pausing i guess the merger of activision blizzard and microsoft so apparently

360
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:56,280
they are right now currently temporarily blocking the merger it was supposed to they're trying to

361
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,640
get it wrapped up in two weeks but now this new restraining order requested by the ftc would

362
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,120
prevent microsoft from closing that deal within the next two weeks and then there's an injunction

363
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:13,960
that would block the deal until ftc's legal challenge is completely resolved um and this

364
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,320
is also kind of um right now they said that the federal judge overseeing the case has

365
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:25,320
temporarily blocked the deal and now microsoft has until june 16th uh so that's already passed

366
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:31,000
to make its case uh while regulators have until june 20th to respond and a hearing will take

367
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,120
place on june 22nd and with microsoft prohibited from closing the the acquisition of activision

368
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:44,920
blizzard until at least five days after that ruling is issued so i guess we'll hear some

369
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,000
more news here in the next couple weeks yeah um you know obviously i had wanted to see this go

370
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,360
through it's interesting because activision is kind of like they were definitely prepared for

371
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,600
it and they're kind of all take or microsoft they're all kind of taking the approach of well

372
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,720
at least this gets this gets this hurt in court faster and we'll get to get through this and you

373
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,280
know figure out where we stand and so i'm kind of like you know what i can appreciate that approach

374
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:16,360
let's let's instead of this thing going on for years and years and years let's just figure are

375
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,840
you gonna let it happen or not let's get the answers sooner rather than later and if you're

376
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,520
not gonna let it happen let's get that why out there on the table so that we can all you know

377
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,320
be irritated with it or understand it or whatever happens with this and how they let

378
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:38,200
like these giant companies like warner brothers buy each other but this isn't gonna go through

379
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:44,520
like that's a little weird i know i again i and i've said this time and time again on the score

380
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,520
on the show i'll say it one more time i'm not a fan of the big fish consistently eating the

381
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,400
other big fish in this industry however in this particular circumstance i will take anything that

382
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,920
gets bobby kotak out of power um and i don't love that he's getting a settlement or he'll get money

383
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,840
at the end of the day unfortunately he's going to get that no matter what happens because that's the

384
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:08,920
fucked up world we live in so as long as his say as long as his word no longer means anything

385
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,880
in gaming that's what i want to happen most of all and that's why i support this merger that's

386
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,840
the end of that's it like i don't even need to consider any other fact other than that it takes

387
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:24,280
bobby kotak out of power and out of this industry that needs to happen yesterday therefore i support

388
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:32,600
the merger that's it yeah all right i would like for him to be never hired for anything again oh

389
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:39,800
i god yes i would like him to retire to a desert island and fade into obscurity and the back pages

390
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:46,920
of history books and that's on how not to run a business but that's you know wishful thinking

391
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:55,960
he'll end up on the board somewhere that would be great too all right let's talk about some twitch

392
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,240
drama that happened this week oh you know you know what live streaming culture it's a big part of

393
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,200
gaming culture and as we're going to talk about with the second half of this you know some of the

394
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:12,360
money that's involved is pro sports level uh so let's talk about the first half of this first

395
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,680
it has to do with the new program that twitch rolled out this week called the partner plus

396
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:25,800
program it would allow certain channels to get a 70 30 split on subs but as people were starting

397
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:31,400
to crunch the numbers they realized this is kind of open to a much smaller group of folks

398
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:39,160
than it really seems like because to be eligible for partner plus you have to maintain at least 350

399
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,360
recurring paid subscriptions gifted and prime ones do not count

400
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:53,400
on paper before you all jump down my throat i want to say i understand where twitch got this

401
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:59,880
from because it's that key word recurring because that is how a lot of these companies not just

402
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:06,200
twitch but your local gym your local subscription service that you forgot to cancel that's how all

403
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:12,280
of these pocket your money is through these recurring subscriptions so from that end i

404
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,440
understand why they're differentiating it from gifted subs and the other stuff

405
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,560
but as somebody who is a content creator and supports my friends who also content creators

406
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:28,280
you almost make way more money off gifted subs and these other things than you do recurring

407
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:35,480
subscriptions so this is a very high bar to me that's very just very deceptive you get only do

408
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,880
oh i've gifted oh you make more money off gifted subs and that stuff well i mean and really the

409
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:48,200
only time i see gifted subs is if i'm doing a subathon i mean i have some i have some recurring

410
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:56,360
yeah but um but like if i have a subathon then then yeah it's gonna way outweigh you know see

411
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:01,640
typically the only way that i get actually i'll take that back right now on average i get more

412
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:11,800
from my regular subscribers and i i thank every one of you and could use more um but but i'll get

413
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,880
this like even if i'm not doing a subathon or something i'll get this big patch of donations

414
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:26,840
which i i love too and that will end up being as much if not more during those bursts of donations

415
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,920
um the reoccurring subs though are are the constant you know the ones you can depend on

416
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:39,800
yeah so they were saying well i was gonna say too with that um that one of the content creators i

417
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:45,640
follow from twitch paladin amber made some comments regarding this whole deal anyway she's really

418
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,440
funny i like her yeah saying she's all this she's all fuck it this was a secret deal that they

419
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,240
offered other streamers if you hit this quota for three months you got the deal indefinitely now

420
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,480
they've added a cap to that time period of 12 months meaning that every year you have to hit

421
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:05,160
this economically unless you're sitting at around thousand viewers or more this is so unattainable

422
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,200
right now based off of the individual and reoccurring subs not gifted not prime people

423
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:15,400
cannot afford to sub people are canceling their subs due to financial reasons and this doesn't help

424
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:23,320
so yeah it's ridiculous well and you know what twitch also is something that they're doing that

425
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:30,360
isn't particularly helping but they're starting to amp up their promo of twitch turbo which again

426
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:36,520
i understand twitch is a business that wants to make money there but these twitch turbo if you

427
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:43,880
buy this you remove ads from the entire platform and that's fine and good but that's usually the

428
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,400
biggest reason to sub to a channel too so twitch is putting out a product that's effectively

429
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:57,320
competing with their content creators so that alone is a little bit kind of you know wacky

430
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,200
so i just i think there's just kind of like this general attitude of like stop putting out these

431
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,000
things with all of these rules and restrictions and so forth just make it across the board

432
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
make it consistent make it fair you know even if it's only like 55 45 at least it's something

433
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,800
you know or what have you it's a bump up i think i'm not sure who they're trying to placate with

434
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:25,320
this because it's more people finding out how they don't fit into this and for all the promotional

435
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:31,480
push they were doing with this all it left it left the vast majority of twitch content producers

436
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,600
feeling i don't fit into this in one way or another i'm an affiliate it doesn't matter

437
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,480
i don't i make most my income off gifted subs it doesn't matter or someone like so basically twitch

438
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:48,920
did this big announcement for people to realize wow i'm not getting this and then on top of that

439
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:55,320
every repost i saw was people saying this isn't for me yeah right and on top of that you have

440
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,680
large creators that are getting these large money deals from kick whether that's a good platform or

441
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:06,280
not it's i guess headed up by crypto gambling bros so who knows well since you brought it up

442
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,760
let's talk about that end of things real quick here let's talk about that so we can talk about

443
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:16,520
the big picture here and that is of course one of the prolific twitch content creators xqc

444
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:23,720
has signed a 100 million dollar deal to start streaming on kick interesting things about this

445
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:29,640
agreement it's technically not exclusive um and so he's still allowed to produce for other platforms

446
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:35,720
including twitch if he really wanted to um and uh it's 70 million over two years but there are

447
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,800
incentives that would push this that's where the 100 million actually comes from but still

448
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:44,680
i think many of us are sitting here going god if i made one million off of playing video games on

449
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,480
the internet that would change my fucking life so xqc making a hundred million seventy million

450
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:56,760
however you want to slice it with this deal is a pretty big deal but then it also causes people to

451
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:03,320
kind of look at but what is kick anyway you know and so we've been talking for a long time about

452
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:09,080
twitch really needs somebody to compete with it and yes youtube does but there's always this

453
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:16,280
weird distinction where like youtube's live stuff is not as strong as twitch is sorry i just even

454
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,160
as a participant and i know people that have moved from twitch to youtube and i just i enjoy the live

455
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:27,000
experience on twitch better but the on-demand experience on youtube far better than twitch

456
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,240
which i'll never understand why twitch literally walked away from the on-demand thing but that's

457
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:38,360
i digress so to me those platforms are very different kick is really trying to clone twitch

458
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:49,000
but what's backing kick uh the ceo and co-founder ed craven is also the co-founder of steak.com

459
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:57,720
it is an online crypto casino uh from curaçao so uh it's it's a lot of crypto it's a lot of gambling

460
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:04,040
in fact if you don't believe me here i am i'm i'm gonna i'm having a fuck it we'll do it live moment

461
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,760
i don't know what i'm about to see but i'm doing it i went to the kick site right now look at that

462
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,960
i'm showing kick on twitch i hope i don't get busted but i'm doing it for the purposes of

463
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:17,000
commentary and i just want to show look at this top three streams right now this one in the third

464
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,920
slot slots and casino the ones being recommended to me over here two out of the five slots and

465
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:30,600
casino second highest category slots and casino third highest category pools hot tubs and bikinis

466
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:38,440
to put it in perspective you have 77 000 just chatting plus another 12 000 we'll say 19 000

467
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:47,000
we're going to generously say 100 000 people on kick not watching video games the highest

468
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,160
video game content on kick right now call of duty war zone 5 000 viewers

469
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:03,800
there's something there there's a certain air of if something is too good to be true it probably is

470
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:11,800
about kick that i can't shake now look cue cue somebody playing this clip to haunt me in 10

471
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:17,240
years when you know i've decided to start a kick channel or whatever you know but as of today

472
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:24,520
kick really feels like something where there's not an adult in the room i i'm just that is

473
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,760
honestly my impression of kick i mean what their their point is and then of course there's so much

474
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:36,280
room for abuse yeah well then you have like adan ross is also part owner backing they have him on

475
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:41,880
there which he's trash and then um was the amaranth apparently got a deal with them now yes yeah

476
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,000
um i mean there's certainly the audience that they're going for it's like kind of like the

477
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:54,120
the wild west version of twitch but we'll see how that pans out like it's it may work now that

478
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:59,880
they're small but you know once it blows up or if it gets any bigger like i i don't know it's

479
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:04,360
gonna be hard to be a legitimate platform but twitch is certainly making competition easier

480
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,120
right now because of their all their bad deals that they're making so yeah but this is gonna

481
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:14,040
this is gonna force twitch to you know step it up so to speak um so it'll be it'll be interesting

482
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:21,000
to see the ripple effect this has so for that and i'm i'm i guess grateful to kick for putting out

483
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,720
things out there that i really do think a 95 5 split i i again if something sounds too good

484
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:35,080
to be true it probably is and this whole thing just reeks of something's something doesn't add

485
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:42,120
up so the math's not mathing maybe it'll be maybe it'll be fine today maybe it'll be fine for a year

486
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:49,240
but i don't know when i think i would like to see a twitch competitor i think of beam mixer that i

487
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,480
i you know rip mixer to be quite honest i still to this day don't understand why i do understand why

488
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,560
microsoft pulled the plug i wish they hadn't i really wish that i wish they hadn't bought

489
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,760
them in the first place to be quite honest but i digress i see them uh that's why i see xqc taking

490
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,600
a deal like this because he's like yeah they may go under cool you know whatever i get paid though

491
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:18,440
so you know that's fine yeah he's probably looking at what happened to ninja yeah but anyway why are

492
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:24,360
these people why are these people so goddamn famous like i i know i'm like i i'm sorry to

493
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:31,240
sound like okay boomer but i it's a serious question like i hasn't this guy kind of put his

494
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,560
foot in his mouth quite a bit i guess that's what people like about him i don't know sometimes

495
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:41,160
controversial people are famous i guess for whatever reason it's weird to to do the classic

496
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:50,120
quote of justification he says what he means oh boy uh okay lots of content yeah no i get it

497
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:55,080
there's a lot of folks in chat lighting up about this uh lots of strong feelings on kick there

498
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:01,080
let's see uh comments dj rama s says kick is basically the man show as a streaming site

499
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,840
oh that's funny honestly i feel like they would print that on the back of the box

500
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:14,440
dj rama says kick is also full of right-wing people too tiger claw says i heard kick is

501
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:20,440
all about free speech bobby blackwolf says kick is free speech absolutionists sjo another matt

502
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,320
says tell me you're not run by dude bros without saying you're run by dude bros yyr says i heard

503
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,880
that kick basically has no moderation like it's the equivalent of what muskrat is trying to turn

504
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:36,360
twitter into they say it's free speech except it winds up just being a hellhole well the thing is

505
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,800
is that a lot of those people will say will claim free speech when they what they mean is hate

506
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:52,760
speech so so i i it's it's gonna take some very different type of signings to get me interested

507
01:03:52,760 --> 01:04:01,560
into in kick i'll just say that so um but i guess have fun and thanks for maybe making twitch sweat

508
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:07,720
a little bit um because the competition is healthy at the end of the day but um there's

509
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:12,760
really nothing on that platform at this time i'm interested in viewing and that's that i mean if my

510
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:17,080
mind changes my mind changes maybe they bring somebody in from the outside who maybe they bring

511
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:21,560
an adult maybe they decide you know what we need an adult to clean this up and if they do it then

512
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:27,960
maybe it'll change so i don't want to own these words forever but as of today no thanks i got

513
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:37,240
better things to do um i i honestly though think that one thing that uh that twitch really needs

514
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:47,800
to do though is pay attention to to what their users are saying you know they're it's not wise

515
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:54,680
what they're doing it's going to be poor business in the long run right so all right all right um

516
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,720
let's uh move on to our next story before i get to that actually dark soccer i wanted to

517
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:06,280
because yyr is in chat and we do appreciate yyr we we we like him an awful lot and appreciate

518
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,800
him being here and as we know yyr is also a hard-working indie game developer um just like

519
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:18,680
loki uh and uh yyr made a game a couple years ago that we absolutely loved called super multitasking

520
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,760
and he was giving us a little update on super multitasking in chat and i just wanted to share

521
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:27,880
he's finishing up the new single player mode called gauntlet rather than slowly build up

522
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,640
and then kick you out after one mistake gauntlet consists of five 30 second rounds that are intense

523
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,720
throughout and if you make mistakes you get to keep going so it sounds like a very kind of

524
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,640
different mode to play in that particular game there so again if you haven't checked out super

525
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:48,760
multitasking it's like worry aware but like even even harder to juggle so uh check it out it's a

526
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:55,080
lot of fun and very addicting available on steam and i believe itch.io um if i'm wrong on that i

527
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:01,400
will be corrected shortly in chat uh but steam for sure so all right uh let's move on i'm gonna

528
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,800
take a quick afk uh real quick but uh dark soccer if you'd like to tell us about what we have to

552
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,600
i forgot about that nintendo world event that's going to be interesting yeah

553
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,960
do we have to wait until then to hear what's coming out for the holiday i feel like we might

554
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,640
it's very interesting how nintendo does that these days so

555
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,520
all right and i don't think i i sat down while you were reading the dates but i don't think i

556
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:42,760
heard a single one of those near us i think the closest one you said was la all right well maybe

557
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:47,080
they'll add you know san francisco or something in the bay san jose or something at some point

558
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:54,920
but all right until then uh loki what do you have for us uh yeah we have the uh announcement that

559
01:09:55,080 --> 01:10:01,320
announcement that basically microsoft is no longer developing for the xbox one console

560
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,520
because you may remember that a lot of the games that they've been developing

561
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,680
have been backwards compatible with the xbox one in the sense that you could buy

562
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:16,760
for one system and it will play on the series s x or the one well now to be able to create

563
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:23,000
higher fidelity games and all of that stuff now they're not going to be focusing on the

564
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:29,880
xbox one and the games coming out will technically be playable on um the x and s however they said

565
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:35,720
games are technically playable on the xbox one via streaming so you'll be able to do it like

566
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:42,280
digitally i guess that way or through um xcloud but they won't natively run on the system which

567
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:47,880
i mean it makes sense i mean like god like how long can they really support that system how long

568
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,520
i mean it's been a long time since that's been out so yeah they weren't gonna i mean this is

569
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,600
a long time for them to have supported the previous generation so it's not completely

570
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,240
surprising technically being supported it's just like hey okay this comes this little console can't

571
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:06,200
run these games anymore and you know to make it a little bit easier on developers and having to

572
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:13,800
like run it for like support such a wide variety of you know specs it's just now you will do it

573
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:18,360
through streaming instead well yeah and the cloud gaming thing is an interesting little twist with

574
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,320
this because we knew that you know microsoft was really going this direction and so you know they

575
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:29,960
want any microsoft device to be able to hook up to streaming and play games can't even the xbox 360

576
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:36,200
do streaming i thought it could i thought they put a player out on 360 i could be wrong but you know

577
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,520
you shouldn't you shouldn't need a very complicated device to do the streaming end of things but what

578
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,760
you need is internet bandwidth and that whole thing you know and that's still going to be an

579
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,480
issue for some people although you know it depends on what resolution you're streaming at you know if

580
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:56,280
you're only streaming it like you know regular 720 hd type are you know very it might not be uh quite

581
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:01,800
as much of a hog on your bandwidth as you think um but you know that's one of those things that

582
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,160
will probably have to be addressed as more and more stuff goes through the cloud okay

583
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:09,560
thanks yyr clarifies in our chat 360 cannot do game streaming i thought that was something they

584
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:14,360
were gonna they were trying to do at one point um was to you know try to put streaming on as

585
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:19,720
many devices as possible which would be smart but it is what it is uh and yrs says it's been

586
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:25,080
10 years i'll have that built in well they're trying to put it in more TVs so you know that's

587
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,920
that's where microsoft wants to go they're putting a lot in the cloud you know that's what got them

588
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:37,080
in trouble with the merger over overseas it's too much in the cloud so but then but then interesting

589
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,680
didn't we get the news on another note it's not in our show world but didn't we get the news

590
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:45,400
that like sony said that they're exploring cloud stuff more for their first party games and this

591
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:50,120
or like more releases that come out they're exploring the cloud gaming with so it's like

592
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,640
they waited for this ruling to come in before saying that this is very strange yeah i mean

593
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:03,800
i don't know it yeah wow yyr points out that netflix disney plus and other apps for 360

594
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:10,040
were all discontinued well rest in peace xbox 360 i guess i mean i get it i just i feel like

595
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:18,200
you know what it's it's like um stadia on a chromebook you know rip but that was the big

596
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:23,320
selling angle was that you can play this thing on a relatively weak device i would have thought

597
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,320
they'd include the 360 in that but i guess maybe it's too old push that too like because they have

598
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:35,800
now um minecraft runs on a chromebook type thing yeah um yeah i mean i still think a chromebook

599
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:42,280
could probably do like game streaming as well but who wants to just buy a chromebook like

600
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,680
unless you're like what's something you give to a kid or you know student or something like that

601
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:53,160
you know i would waste the money i'd buy it i don't know i mean i have i bought my kids gaming

602
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:57,560
laptops because if they're gonna have a laptop i'm not buying them a piece of garbage laptop

603
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:03,720
that can't do anything so yeah all right well you know what you don't need a very good system to

604
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:11,880
play this next game and this is definitely from the school of wtf lol bbq uh this is a new game

605
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,520
boy color game that has been released we can't make games for the xbox one but we can make them

606
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:24,440
for the game boy color and this is a mcdonald's based game this is mcdonald's very blunt and very

607
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:31,000
uh transparent attempt to do as much viral marketing as possible for bringing back grimace

608
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:37,160
from the mcdonaldland gang um as they're celebrating grimace's birthday uh celebration

609
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:42,040
i think there's a new shake or something like that i don't know but uh they actually doesn't

610
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:47,800
make you grimace there it is literally a purple shake um i don't know if i don't know what flavor

611
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:54,600
it is i assume grape what other purple flavors are there i i don't know so that sounds really

612
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,040
awful somebody in chat will have to tell me because when i go to mcdonald's and order a

613
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,240
drink i usually get the coffee because it's actually not bad but it's because they do it

614
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:07,480
dunkin donut style where it's like half half creamer but anyway um grimace's birthday is a

615
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:14,040
game that they have developed for the game boy color it was developed by cruel toys that's krool

616
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:19,160
and you can actually play this on a browser if you want over at grimace's birthday.com i cannot

617
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:23,720
believe i just gave mcdonald's free advertising here on the show but hey it is what it is they

618
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:28,680
did this type of thing to get this type of coverage right uh so anyway uh some people

619
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:34,760
have actually gone into the site and pulled the rom out and it will actually run on actual hardware

620
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:39,800
if you use an everdrive or something like that to actually play the game i kind of wonder if maybe

621
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:44,040
this game was developed at one point and then stopped and now they picked it up again i don't

622
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,640
know but maybe not it was developed by cruel toys is the company that developed it so it was

623
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:54,200
developed by somebody yeah i thought maybe maybe back in the day there was a game boy game that

624
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:01,960
started and then didn't finish but i guess i guess it's nothing nice like that so yeah king k rule

625
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:09,160
uh pod culture says mixed berry i don't know if that was the grimace shake flavor or if it's

626
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:14,840
another purple flavor yeah but either would work it's vanilla and berry or whatever you know now i

627
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:20,760
feel real bad that i didn't like try to cash in on some sort of like fast food uh tie-in with my game

628
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:28,360
i mean i got probably uh teamed up with chipotle i mean it makes you shit so i guess you know that

629
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:34,840
would have worked but oh well you know too late now honestly it would have worked with um

630
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:42,120
mcdonald's as well yeah any fast food i'm still open for negotiation any fast food company out

631
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:49,240
there i will sell cheap you should hit up arby's they're very edgy on social media

632
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:55,320
absolutely your game would work although you're gonna owe yyr some profits off that i hope you

633
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:02,040
know that's fine and to be honest i think dark soccer also had some of the idea concept with

634
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:11,160
that so you're buying us all some uh happy meals yeah yum all right yeah

635
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:18,200
dj rama s in chat says you must defeat the hamburglar to stand a chance that was the

636
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,880
thing i was saying what's up with the mcdonaldland reboot like i remember when the whole thing on

637
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:28,520
social media and this was not that long ago this was maybe like seven years ago the whole thing

638
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:34,920
was oh no the hamburglar's hot do you remember this they like recast the hamburger like seven

639
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:40,600
years ago and like he was fucking hot well why are they even bringing back grimace when i thought

640
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:46,200
they got rid of ronald mcdonald's so what the hell is like none of the universe makes any sense

641
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:53,800
anymore it's like well he's too ronald mcdonald's too creepy giant purple thing not so creepy let's

642
01:17:54,360 --> 01:18:00,680
do a birthday game for that okay wait i have to show this sorry it's uh how do we get other

643
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:07,800
screen here there it is uh this was from 2015 so this was this was about eight years ago there it

644
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:17,080
is the hamburglar as cbc news says a strangely attractive suburban dad where was that guy's game

645
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:25,720
i mean just asking i is certainly more attractive than the other hamburglar so i'm gonna say that

646
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:33,800
if if we're going to put the you know the characters of mcdonald's on a fuckability list

647
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:40,520
that hamburglar probably pretty high on the list yeah uh right up there with uh what's birdie

648
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:56,120

where am i going to see it because they all they all protested on reddit so i i thought that's

658
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:57,880
where all the the the shocking shit on the internet was was on reddit i don't know twitter

659
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:05,400
all right anyway uh let's move on uh more news to make you grimace uh dar sakra

660
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:14,760
so um for fans of the soul caliber franchise uh soul caliber 5 will be delisted uh for uh

661
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:25,480
playstation 3 and xbox 360 um i mean it is kind of old um but uh after june 19th so for us in the

662
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:34,520
us tomorrow the game and its dlc will no longer be available for purchase so oops um and i made

663
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:38,680
a mistake because i was watching the trailer again and i accidentally paused on valdo's butt crack

664
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:46,520
and i'm traumatized now um i mean it was a really it was a really good game so caliber

665
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:52,200
six though was better yeah but it really did kind of drag it back to where they wanted the franchise

666
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:58,680
five for me was one of the weaker entries in the series but you know i was more surprised with the

667
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,840
whole like why is it getting delisted and the only thing i think of was it has must have to

668
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:08,280
do with the ezio the guest character in five and maybe some type of license but it's not it's more

669
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:13,160
like 11 years at this point not 10 so i was trying to figure out like what is it that they lost in

670
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:18,600
that game it has to be the ezio licensing or something um why they're having to delist it

671
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,400
but if you know what used copies of that game about to go up in value because now you can't

672
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:29,000
get a digital so there is that if you have a uh a disc copy of soul caliber five you know hang on

673
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,280
to it because that's the only way you're gonna be able to play it now because they can't take the

674
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:38,200
disc from you but they can pull it for the digital storefronts so yeah i think i've got one like

675
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:43,000
laying around somewhere i know i feel i'm like i have one in my giant stack of like playstation

676
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,400
three games somewhere because it was a p wasn't that a ps3 game that was a ps3 game not even four

677
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:55,720
right yeah yeah yeah that's what i said yeah it all blurs together sometimes all right uh moving

678
01:21:55,720 --> 01:22:02,280
on uh loki yeah so the embracer group now is going they've announced that they're going through

679
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:09,080
a restructure and layoffs as well as studier closures are coming uh this is i think from a

680
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:13,640
two billion dollar acquisition deal that went through they were supposed to be purchasing

681
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:21,000
something and um well it didn't work out so uh they said embracer currently engages close to

682
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,880
17 000 people and while that number will be lower by the end of the year that's a fun way of saying

683
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:32,840
you're a layoff people it's truly too early to give an exact forecast on this um because the

684
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:39,160
reality is the quicker we act the sooner we'll merge as a stronger company i'm not sure which

685
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:45,640
studios are looking to sell off uh volition um are you saying that the heist and the hazardous

686
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:54,280
didn't bring you out of like out of the red into the black or whatever um like i thought for sure

687
01:22:54,280 --> 01:23:01,960
that would turn that game around that awful piece of crap game around but yeah um you know this was

688
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,440
a company that like they kept making acquisitions and i don't think they were necessarily on strong

689
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:11,000
ip but we'll have to see what they're going to do it says the actions will include but not limited

690
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:16,360
to closing or divestments of some studios and termination or pausing of some ongoing game

691
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:21,320
development projects yeah cut your losses while you can't say it's real well i just i feel bad

692
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:27,880
for the people whose jobs are affected you know from this big fish getting too big it does suck

693
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:32,200
yeah it says we'll also decrease spending on non-development costs such as overhead and other

694
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:38,120
operating expenses we will reduce the third-party publishing and put greater focus on internal ip

695
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:46,200
and increase external funding of large budget games i did i did notice the tomb raider team

696
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:51,240
went out of their way to come out and say we're not affected by it well duh yeah i mean out of

697
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:57,880
like you know out of the the different studios i mean i guess gearbox entertainment's pretty big

698
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:04,280
um but you know out of those i think crystal dynamics yeah it's pretty solid like their games

699
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:10,200
make money well they did do the avengers which wasn't so well received but i don't think that

700
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:15,480
was their fault it was good that's that that's the more screen that was that was definitely

701
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:19,560
a business decision that was that was decisions that were forced into that game that made it bad

702
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:24,600
i don't think that was crystal d's fault i think that was executive pressure fault yeah

703
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:30,760
all right well hope it we'll have to figure out what happens uh we'll get some more details i'm

704
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:35,160
assuming once layouts start happening i mean because people aren't going to be quiet about it

705
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:40,200
yeah but that's that's still really sad so hope everybody lands on their feet soon or we see some

706
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:46,200
really strong indie games and new studios formed as a result as sometimes happens with these

707
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:52,360
stories all right uh let's talk about some rumors that are going around but we're actually going to

708
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:58,040
shut them down and this is the deal uh there's a rumor going around that illumination universal

709
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:03,640
and nintendo are about to sign on a legend of zelda film deal which would make a lot of sense

710
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:08,920
considering how much fucking money the mario movie made like obviously you know people are thinking

711
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,600
about what other nintendo you know animated movies can they make which of course led to

712
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:18,200
the whole discussion about would zelda be an animated movie i wanted an acted movie i wanted

713
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:24,760
this i wanted that uh but basically uh they've they've come up to say like shut the fuck up and

714
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,240
this is cut this uh shut the fuck up is coming from super i'm paraphrasing but super mario

715
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:35,960
brothers movie producer chris meladandri uh said shut the fuck up no he said i don't know where

716
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,800
that came from about the zelda rumor i mean i can i can understand how people would surmise all

717
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,360
sorts of things because obviously we've had a great experience working together my relationship

718
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:51,080
with nintendo now includes being on their board of directors so i understand how people can surmise

719
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:55,560
these things but in terms of the specifics that was just something i've been hearing lots of

720
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:01,480
reports this is just about what's next between nintendo and illumination shut the fuck up

721
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,520
anyway you don't you don't want a zelda movie right now anyway because chris pratt would end

722
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:18,840
up voicing link and none of us want that so um i i feel like what comes next from the mario movie

723
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:25,960
which i still haven't seen you're not missing a lot i have it i know i need to i need to watch

724
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:31,720
it some i just i'm lazy it's one of those you know what maybe i'll just wait at this point and uh when

725
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:36,200
i come to visit bobby in july since by the way i will be at southern fried gaming expo at the

726
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:42,520
end of july in atlanta i'll i'll watch the mario movie at black wolf manor it'll be it'll be uh

727
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:47,640
it'll be a fun time so besides dark soccer you're taking me on a different movie date remember

728
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:54,840
all right why why can't there be more than one that's true why not both why not both all right

729
01:26:55,480 --> 01:27:01,640
um we'll we'll see what develop i was gonna say with the mario movie uh donkey kong you know

730
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:07,080
things in that universe a sequel things in that universe seem a little more you know like what's

731
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:15,880
probably coming next and not just you know the legend of zelda but uh we'll see uh sj100 matt

732
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:21,400
says illumination verse where the movies all tie together for a smash brothers movie that's the

733
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,480
thing that's the thing that so many people on the internet what want do you know how long it would

734
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,720
take us to get to a fucking smash brothers movie do you know how long it would take us to get there

735
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:37,560
it passes i guess again an avengers movie yeah a while a while all right well you know what

736
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:42,120
let's this is a great opportunity for us to go to this next segment and talk about you know

737
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:46,520
some of these things that we might get to discover a little more of in the smash brothers universe

738
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:47,640
let's roll the bumper

739
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:03,640
and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull

740
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:10,520
out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week all right dark soccer

741
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:20,360
what did you pick for us tonight i picked mario brothers not super not donkey kong

742
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:27,240
i picked mario brothers we are going to basics great pick one of my all-time favorites

743
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:35,080
so um it came out in 1983 so it's old

744
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:44,600
like us i mean well no we're not old we're vintage

745
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:56,440
yeah anyway um it came out in 1983 so 40 years ago um it was developed and published for

746
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:08,440
arcades by nintendo designed by miyamoto and the uh late yokoi gunpei um and it uh basically

747
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:17,800
just had two twin brothers they are twins originally mario and luigi who are exterminating

748
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:23,800
creatures that come from the sewers by knocking them upside down and kicking them away um the

749
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:31,400
first uh the version for the famicom slash nintendo entertainment system was the first

750
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:36,600
game produced by intelligent systems and it is definitely considered a part of the mario

751
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:41,240
franchise but originally began as a spin-off from the donkey kong series

752
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:51,400
at any rate um there is an updated version of it as a mini game in super mario

753
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:57,560
in super mario advanced series and other games and it's been re-released through various methods

754
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:07,480
before um so basically they jump you know knock these uh little creatures underneath or hit a

755
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:15,400
pow block in the center the origin of the pow block um they are a wraparound so you can run

756
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:22,680
off screen and come out the other side um and you knock the creatures upside down while avoiding

757
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:30,200
other creatures and uh and other obstacles like fireballs and whatnot and then you kick them off

758
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:39,960
the screen um but when you are out of lives you are your game's over um and you get extra points

759
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:47,800
by doing consecutive knockovers you know and you have all kinds of different enemies four

760
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:58,520
there are four of them there is the shell creeper which um is what evolved into the uh the koopa

761
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:08,440
trooper or as they are known in japan noko noko um but yeah that was the origin of them there's

762
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:15,400
the side stepper which requires two hits the fighter fly which moves by jumping and it can

763
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:23,400
only be flipped when it touches a platform and the slight slice piece however it's pronounced

764
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:30,680
that um turns the platforms into ice and it's slippery um it will disappear immediately instead

765
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:35,960
of flipping over and so it doesn't count towards your score um ice platforms will return to normal

766
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:41,320
at the start of each phase and then there's the fifth one the fireballs and

767
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:49,160
yeah you can't do shit to them um green ones are faster but disappear quicker the red ones

768
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:55,560
bounce around and don't disappear until they're hit from below so you can't really get points

769
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:03,000
out of them either um like i already mentioned the pal block um and it always fills itself at the

770
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:13,560
start of each bonus round so um it's the the game was actually suggested by yokoi uh to miyamoto

771
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:21,240
that mario should be able to fall from any height but miyamoto thought it's not much of a game

772
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:25,400
but they thought maybe he could have some superhuman abilities and they designed a

773
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:32,920
prototype that had mario jumping and bouncing around and then the uh enemies were introduced

774
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:40,360
again by yokoi um and you know had multiple floors set up and it really just uh evolved from there

775
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:48,440
and um because of mario's appearance in donkey kong they had overalls a hat and a mustache thick

776
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:53,080
mustache they decided to make him a plumber but he was almost a carpenter

777
01:32:54,120 --> 01:33:04,200
so um and so they designed the game around the the plumber aspect um at any rate um there there's

778
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:14,440
a story about how mario became uh went from jumpman to to mario is that um a landlord named

779
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:24,040
mario's sick i'm not gonna pronounce right segale segale um had uh come in um and a nintendo of

780
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:32,120
america daft meeting to demand rent and they named jumpman after him that that's a story going around

781
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:38,760
i mean so at any rate this also introduced louis g who was created for the multiplayer mode as a

782
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:47,640
palette swap of mario so uh the two-player mode was also inspired a little bit by joust and um

783
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:56,920
by now mario brothers has been released for more than a dozen platforms um and they used the first

784
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:04,120
movement from Mozart's uh eine kleine Nachtmusik um at the start of the game and uh the song has

785
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:13,480
been used in other games like uh ddr mario mix and super smash brothers brawl um at any rate uh

786
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:20,840
there are some conflicting release dates even though the official date was in 83

787
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:28,520
um game machine magazine stated that it made its north american debut at the amoa show

788
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:35,560
march 25th through 27th and entered mass production in japan on june 21st um and then

789
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:44,600
there's these other different you know uh accounts of it but iwata in uh in an intended director in

790
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:52,920
2013 uh gave the presentation stating that the game was first released in japan on july 14th 1983

791
01:34:53,800 --> 01:35:00,040
um it was labeled originally as the third game of the donkey kong series but uh

792
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,840
the uh over uh but you know we all know now that was actually more the beginning of the mario

793
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:13,960
series and there was a donkey kong 3 um but also um as far as the conversions nintendo held all

794
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:22,680
the rights in japan but the overseas licensing was given to atari um now the ports lots of them

795
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:30,920
many of them um there's the atari 2600 5200 atari 8-bit family atari 7800 answered cpc and zx

796
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:36,600
spectrum commodore 64 had two versions an atari soft port that did not get a commercial release

797
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:44,360
in the 1986 version by ocean software the atari 8-bit uh conversion was by sculptured software

798
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:50,200
and it's the only home port that has falling icicles there is an apple 2 version that was

799
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:57,000
never commercially released but it but copies exist um the nes one was released in north america

800
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:04,520
on july 23 1986 sorry that was the uh the family uh no that was the one never mind there was a

801
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:11,000
later nes port that was exclusive in europe in 93 called mario brothers classic series

802
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:19,640
um it was on virtual console it uh for we 3ds and we you um super mario brother uh sorry mario

803
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:25,800
brothers was also released in september 2017 for switch as part of the arcade archives series the

804
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:33,000
nest version was a launch title for nintendo switch online um it's been included in bonus stages for

805
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:40,920
super mario brothers 3 um in super mario advance mario elegy superstar saga there's a nest version

806
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:50,040
of it in animal crossing for gamecube aka animal crossing e plus um also uh you needed uh an e

807
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:59,080
reader to do the animal crossing e card version um there's also in 20 2004 there is a namco arcade

808
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:04,280
cabinet that contained donkey kong donkey kong jr mario brothers um although mario brothers was

809
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:10,840
altered for a vertical screen that was used by the other games um and it is cropped on the side

810
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:17,720
letterbox that way um it was a modest success when it originally came out 2000 cabinets sold in the

811
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:24,440
us by july 1983 and then it went on to be a lot more successful than that um game machine listed

812
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:30,440
mario brothers on their july uh 15th 93 issue as being the third most successful new table arcade

813
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:39,960
unit of the month uh nintendo uh sold 3800 mario brothers arcade cabinets in the us

814
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:47,080
and they are now considered mildly rare and hard to find um and even though it was released during

815
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:55,080
the video game crash of 83 the game did pretty well it wasn't affected by that um it's been

816
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:05,240
i'd say moderately well rated you know the 80 and higher um all across the board and and

817
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:14,760
it's had some legacy versions so the legacy versions are um you know kind of related versions

818
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:22,680
i should say is kite kita mario brothers that came out for famicom disc with uh added features and

819
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:27,880
uh revisions to the gameplay it had cutscenes and advertisements because it was sponsored

820
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:34,760
by a food company called uh nagatani um and it was only available as a disc writer promotion

821
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:40,600
84 hudson soft made two different games based on um mario brothers there's mario brothers special

822
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:48,040
that was a uh it had new phases and different gameplay and there was punch ball mario brothers

823
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:53,240
had a new gameplay mechanic as in punching small balls to stun enemies both of these were related

824
01:38:53,240 --> 01:39:02,200
for the nec pc 8801 the fm7 and the sharp x1 mario clash came out on the virtual boy talk about

825
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:10,040
your fucking migraine games okay um i've got it um it was developed as a straight remake called

826
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:16,120
originally called mario brothers vb and it's the first stereoscopic 3d mario game instead of

827
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:21,640
bumping into your enemies from below you have to hit them with shell creeper shells um super mario

828
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:26,840
3d world for wii u has a version of mario brothers starring luigi called luigi brothers

829
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:33,800
um the high score for the arcade version as recorded by twin galaxies is by steve uh clay

830
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:39,080
soth um at five million four hundred twenty four thousand nine hundred and twenty points

831
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:50,840
and that's it so many versions yes my goodness um in fact it's funny you know i i was mentioning

832
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:55,160
about how this is this is really truly one of my favorite games of all time like or you know

833
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:59,080
especially when you go to classics like part of the one of the games that really got me into

834
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:04,360
gaming but um you talked about all of the various variety of ports that there were for the game

835
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:10,520
right and so you know you know which one of those i got hooked on you had the only released uh

836
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:18,360
commodore 64 version no it was the atari 2600 version gotcha well i mean i thought i just i'm

837
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:25,320
fucking around but you know i i i played a shit ton of this on the atari 2600 and i factually

838
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:29,480
found a video out there on youtube of what it looked like because man the graphics were really

839
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:36,040
parsed back from what you saw in the arcade but i remember the coin was literally like a data square

840
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:41,720
like it literally looked like nothing but like a garbled image um but you know what the gameplay

841
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:47,960
for the most part was definitely there um and i got hooked on this you know what i think i

842
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:51,640
don't know that i have the 5200 version so i'm gonna have to

843
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:59,960
go nab it oh i bet i bet the 5200 version looks so much better i found a cassette no i didn't

844
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:06,680
never mind i thought it was a cassette it's not but i mean there's one that's actually in a

845
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:12,680
sealed box going for 700 bucks but honestly everyone else is selling like the other standard

846
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:18,120
expensive one is like a uh a fifty dollar yeah there's a bunch of repros out there

847
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:23,240
so the 5200 version has some interesting kind of frame rate issues but otherwise it's a pretty

848
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:28,680
darn loyal port it looks like so that's kind of interesting the 7800 version actually would be

849
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:35,720
really nice to have too i have a 7800 yeah better play that you know than all the ninja golf uh and

850
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:44,120
then in chat dark tatsuya says i heard the pc 88 versions uh were uh neat i wish they'd released

851
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:49,880
those on fds or something well it turns out there actually is a gameplay clip out there on youtube

852
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:56,840
of the pc 8801 version that i'm bringing up this doesn't look anything like mario brothers what the

853
01:41:56,840 --> 01:42:00,760
hell is this hold on hold on sorry uh and for those in the podcast feed like we're just seeing

854
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:05,400
a stage that just looks completely different and i was looking at one that had like conveyor belts

855
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,160
and things like that this doesn't look a thing like the other one but i guess that's part of

856
01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:13,960
what makes it so cool is that it does uh lay out the configuration of stages in different ways

857
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:18,440
and things of that sort so i guess yeah as far as like a collectible item could go that is kind of

858
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:23,720
interesting i'll give it that um but very different from uh the other mario brothers

859
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:26,540
neat

860
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:35,980
so all right uh yyr in chat says i'm impressed by that 2600 version yeah i mean as far as like

861
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:41,820
2600 ports go the mario brothers one was pretty you know well done i remember popeye was also

862
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:46,060
pretty decent on 2600 like i i something about those nintendo ports again they didn't do them

863
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:52,700
here like dark soccer said i i feel like parker brothers made all those parts or something it's

864
01:42:52,700 --> 01:43:00,780
been a long time but um uh the the atari ports are always very interesting so all right well

865
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:04,940
great great pick dark soccer i'm a little biased because that's one of my favorites too and again

866
01:43:04,940 --> 01:43:12,540
i was like she never picked that ever yeah but yeah that's how it goes sometimes all right let's

867
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:17,100
check out some other headlines around the gaming industry real quick in a segment we call rapid

868
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:24,220
fire news we'll go to loki apparently people found out that you can go google katamari and

869
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:29,740
it'll actually bring up a little katamari ball that you can click on and then roll around the

870
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:37,900
page and pick up the images on the page so that's neat and it works on your phones too

871
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:45,260
yes you can click to um it'll roll towards where you click or tap so that's kind of kind of neat

872
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:51,500
how about a new katamari game someday no we're just gonna remake the old ones rehashes the old

873
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:57,660
ones over and over again all right sounds good and then uh there's a new leak coming out about

874
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:03,260
mortal kombat 1 apparently the reddit user who previously leaked the mortal kombat 11

875
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:10,380
details and dlc roster um they were sent a fake character list for moral kombat 1 by a user and

876
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:15,260
then they revealed uh that the characters were which characters were fake on that leakers list

877
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:21,580
also this has been corroborated by another proven leaker fate unknown so right now it says the

878
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:29,900
reboot will include 19 characters including ashra havoc johnny cage kenshi katana hung lau

879
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:42,140
lee may lu kang melina natara raden arico reptile scorpion shang tsung cindell smoke sub-zero and

880
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:48,540
tanya they're going into the console releases uh first the early console releases for some of those

881
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:59,100
characters it's interesting yeah all right cool uh dar sakura how about you um yeah i got something

882
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:08,540
um so i don't know why i haven't heard of this game before hell singer yeah but anyway um is a

883
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:18,540
rhythmic first-person shooter metal game and it's going to have dlc that uh oh yeah the essential

884
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:25,900
hits pack dlc will be launching um it actually should already be out on steam ps5 and xbox series

885
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:36,620
x slash s um but anyway um you go through eight musically infused hells with a blade and different

886
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:45,260
guns so the uh new dlc is going to have stuff by uh gorillas i have to now have this of course

887
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:56,140
uh depeche mode um and uh let me see uh iconopop but i love it that song is like old but everywhere

888
01:45:56,700 --> 01:46:04,620
uprising by muse uh down with the sickness uh galantis runaway misery business by paramour

889
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:13,500
uh tsunami so yeah these are big songs yeah yeah well i mean it's feel good ink by gorillas i mean

890
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:19,900
older one but that was one that got a lot of people into gorillas that weren't before

891
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:25,660
uh dark to see it points out that this is on game pass saying i haven't tried this but might have to

892
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:30,060
make room on xbox while it's still on game pass me too this one's has not been on my radar but

893
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:35,660
it sounds like it ought to be and uh a dlc is a really good way to make money off a game that's

894
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:45,740
on game pass so um clever clever idea all right um moving on let's talk about diablo 4 and the

895
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:53,260
cow level or lack thereof that's right cow level is all over the news this week because uh it's

896
01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:58,940
being denied uh that the exist that the level is actually there uh general manager rod ferguson the

897
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:04,780
general manager diablo in an interview with kind of funny said uh we really wanted to ground diablo

898
01:47:04,780 --> 01:47:10,220
4 as much as possible we've had some fun but we want to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic

899
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:14,940
dark themes we had and because of that there's no secret level in diablo 4 that people might be

900
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:20,220
looking for as per previous games that hasn't stopped people from looking because apparently

901
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:26,300
there's minor evidence in the game some references to cows uh apparently there's like a bloody wooden

902
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:32,300
shard that has the letter w carved into it there's a musty tome that has things in it here's the

903
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:37,260
thing here's how i feel about the cow level i realized it was a thing in diablo 2 it didn't

904
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:44,060
show up in diablo 3 until one of the anniversary events so i don't think it's in i actually truly

905
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:48,700
don't think it's in diablo 4 right now but it will be eventually someday because the other

906
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:53,980
thing nobody's talking about is whimsy shire whimsy dale and that whole thing uh that is also

907
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:58,780
in diablo 3 but i don't remember if it was there at the start but they ended up adding it later

908
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:04,700
so i would say these will be things you're gonna see in expansions for diablo 4 because

909
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:09,820
that's gonna have a reason for you to come back exactly they're gonna keep you coming back for

910
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:14,700
something so yes it's all about the gothic dark fantasy now and all that and the storytelling is

911
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:21,260
really good and everything but they're gonna but look diablo 3 had a very similar path it was

912
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:25,420
serious in the beginning too and then got really fucking over the top towards the end diablo 4

913
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:29,900
will go the exact same way watch i mean they said it right now they said they want to keep

914
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:42,140
it grounded grounded like beef ground beef half-life 3 confirmed can you clip that matt

915
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:50,940
all right all right anyway apparently there is a whole discord server uh called not finding a cow

916
01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:56,140
level for people trying to look for the stupid cow level that's probably not there but we'll be

917
01:48:56,140 --> 01:49:01,020
there in a later patch for sure all right meanwhile let's check out some video games

918
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:06,460

931
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:24,140
a big deal in japan that is releasing on the playstation 5 this week um but if that's not

938
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:05,260
expecting it to be kind of a big deal especially after that demo apparently that demo increased

939
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:10,140
pre-orders in japan which was something that they were looking to do so very very interesting all

01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:15,500
uh around the world uh in game releases this week all right we have a few more stories for

949
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:21,500
you and then we'll be inviting your calls over at vog network.com discord our discord server

950
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:28,540
uh first up though let's go to loki yeah so apparently rockstar games has decided to remove

951
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:35,740
180 plus cars from grand theft auto online for some reason well that some reason is probably

952
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:42,220
greed is what it is but apparently yeah they've removed them from purchase in their in-game shops

953
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:50,700
and along with that though um they are offering some of them in some creative ways so for example

954
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:57,740
one of those ways is oh look at that it's that six dollar a month pay wall called gta plus that

955
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:03,500
when you have that you can exclusively buy some of these cars or they have them in literally

956
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:08,860
gambling as a part of the casino where they you know you've probably seen this in like real life

957
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:14,620
where they have actual like casinos that are wrapped you know auctioning off cars and stuff

958
01:53:14,620 --> 01:53:20,060
like that well some of those are available through that as well so literal gambling in their game

959
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:27,260
thank goodness and um a lot of these nobody asked for yeah a lot of these are really like

960
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:30,780
old cars that are they just want more people to stream the game on kick

961
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:38,060
they're just classic cars that were like staples of like the series from all the way back to

962
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:43,500
like number one i mean it's it is kind of ridiculous the large amount of cars that are in here

963
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:52,380
um i don't know like they're also there's uh obviously there's a los santos car meet

964
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:57,980
which you can actually meet other players and buy them from them i guess it's like a

965
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:04,300
market that they can sell does rockstar take a cut of that too i mean like of course surprise

966
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:11,660
of course um so i don't know all the all the more reason like i hear stuff like this this

967
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:17,420
just really doesn't want make me want to you know uh play grand theft auto line which i haven't done

968
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:27,580
for a very long time it's gotten pretty bad um gta6 when i don't know hopefully well within the

969
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:33,420
next financial year so you know we'll probably hear about that at some point soon because they're

970
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:40,140
saying they're making billions of dollars next year um they said that they explained that they

971
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:45,180
removed lesser used vehicles although some of these are like big supercars and stuff that like

972
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:50,700
were some of the best cars in the game so i don't see how those are less used and what's the point

973
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:56,300
of that when they're not like removing the models of the cars from the game because if you own the

974
01:54:56,300 --> 01:55:01,500
car already you get to keep it you still have it it's not like it just disappears it's just that

975
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:08,620
you can't buy them anymore so but why like that doesn't make any sense because it doesn't take up

976
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:17,500
any space reasons i mean paywalls is what i'm guessing i don't know but i don't know i don't get

977
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:24,140
all right well let's talk about a game that is coming out this fiscal year no really it is for

978
01:55:24,140 --> 01:55:33,420
sure uh dar sakura i think you have a little update on starfield yeah i do um so it's actually

979
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:42,540
more about shirley curry also known as the skyrim grandma um she there was an easter egg of her in

980
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:47,660
the starfield direct showcase but she is flat out says she is not in the game nor is she going to

981
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:55,660
play it because oh no just the whole like i'm not gonna play it oh there's a reason she says she's

982
01:55:55,660 --> 01:56:02,940
too angry because they're still waiting for elder scrolls six um get them grandma but i mean and

983
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:06,860
people are you know and she actually has a rebuttal for the people saying she's too close

984
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:15,580
minded about the games that she plays um but she says not so that she tries all kinds of games she

985
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:23,020
just doesn't like many of them um like she tried fallout and said it was way too depressing for her

986
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:33,500
um and uh she uh she's been so frustrated with waiting for elder scrolls um and she's kind of

987
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:39,180
uh run out of steam with skyrim right now um and starfield isn't really her thing because she

988
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:48,140
doesn't like space games so her her quote on here though is that uh um i have waited so long for

989
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:54,460
elder scrolls six as has everyone else i have played skyrim for so many years and made up my

990
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:59,660
own stories within the game that's getting harder to find new stories in my head on the same land of

991
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:06,540
skyrim um the starfield presentation was nice but still it's a space game and i am just an elder

992
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:13,340
scrolls five skyrim addict i guess lol this is from an email um so yeah are you saying the

993
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:20,460
skyrim grandma went on record uh when asked about elder scrolls six she said it's been 84 years

994
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:32,460
no okay uh dj rama s is suggesting that shirley curry should join forces with whoopi goldberg

995
01:57:32,460 --> 01:57:39,340
and cause havoc on those gaming companies i'm all for a gaming grandma's union um it's quite

996
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:43,500
awesome did you uh dark sakura shirley you've heard about the whoopi goldberg is she have you

997
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:49,580
heard about this yes she's pissed about oh she uh loki she's pissed about diablo 4 because she's

998
01:57:49,580 --> 01:57:54,460
actually a big diablo gaming fan uh and i knew that i knew she was super into diablo what i

999
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:59,020
didn't know is that she plays on a mac and they didn't put diablo 4 on a mac for whatever reason

1000
01:57:59,020 --> 01:58:06,060
which is which you know now that whoopi points it out i i you know blizzard usually does put their

1001
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:13,340
stuff out on mac so it's weird but um i'd always given them is that they were really

1002
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:20,940
early and strong mac supporters yeah so this this comes out of left field unless now

1003
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:30,060
the reason i could think is perhaps maybe they just don't quite have the skill with uh programming

1004
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:43,580
for both uh uh the uh doing intel and uh the m chip series yeah um or with uh with rosetta

1005
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:52,060
compatibility so that might that might be a an issue and and it's an understandable one

1006
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:59,820
but the m series has been out now for three years yeah they've had time and the development units

1007
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:08,060
are always available for uh for well developers like way early yeah so um it is interesting

1008
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:11,820
though that whoopi is going full karen on which is ironic because that's a real name

1009
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:16,220
uh is going full carrot on this uh with the whole wanting a refund and all this because i guess i

1010
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:20,380
guess she forgot to look and see if it would be she's kind of assumed it would be on mac um you

1011
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:26,780
know i guess i yeah she didn't figure that out so now she wants a refund i'm sure she'll get it but

1012
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:31,260
as some folks are pointing out did you're on my essence chat says well proton ish is coming to

1013
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:36,060
mac and mac os and oma and i know that there's been chat about that they are they have made some

1014
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:42,300
steps to make some of the gaming stuff potentially easier to port so maybe this isn't the end-all be

1015
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:48,460
all on diablo 4 and a lot of other games to be quite frank so uh miss goldberg may get her way

1016
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:54,220
uh eventually so we'll see but i'm sure she wants to slay demons in hell like the rest of us all

1017
01:59:54,220 --> 02:00:05,580
all right um moving on loki yeah so in the most non-news of news uh jeff keeley has confirmed it

1018
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:12,140
yes summers game fest is coming back next year like duh like we knew that was going to happen

1019
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:19,260
but apparently this year has set some records for him so cool look forward to it since i mean

1020
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:27,820
e3 isn't really a thing so but we kind of figured it was coming anyways yep yeah um i mean it's nice

1021
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:32,060
to have it confirmed as opposed to e3 that was up in the air until about six weeks before when

1022
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:38,460
finally they were like oh i guess we're not doing it uh oops so all right well congrats to jeff

1023
02:00:38,460 --> 02:00:43,900
keeley i guess the in-person event was pretty good um you know our invite was lost in the mail but

1024
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:52,540
apparently it was it was a good event good time was had all right uh let's talk about this is i

1025
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:58,380
think big news we have heard that this was coming and there's been some beta releases of it but

1026
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:02,780
i was playing dead by daylight this week at some point and i noticed i was like these notifications

1027
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:09,180
are in a different font oh my gosh the steam client changed and it sure did that's right

1028
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:15,100
the steam client overhauled notifications the ui elements the in-game overlay is now different

1029
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:21,100
so that desktop client did get its update and that was released on june 14th so a few days ago

1030
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:27,260
right around the time of that dbd patch ironically um and so many of those things like yeah it's it's

1031
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:33,020
fine i like the typography actually i really like the typography better in it um it just looks a

1032
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:38,860
little bit more modern a little bit more uh makes better use of the space that it has from a design

1033
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:47,340
standpoint i do not really care for how it acts in the g-force experience um but i'm not mad about

1034
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:52,940
it and maybe that's just something g-force needs to work on too on their end or something you know

1035
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:59,740
since it is new for everybody so but it's been a delight here on my mac but one thing that uh

1036
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:06,620
is is gone with this update the legacy steam big picture mode uh for those that remember that from

1037
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:12,220
those old like you know steam machines used to use that and that uh the now the bug fixes has

1038
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:18,380
the op command line option enable old big picture it has been removed um but you have a steam deck

1039
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:22,460
interface if you uh you don't have a steam deck machine you want to use that but the uh old big

1040
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:31,420
picture is gone some of us can airplay if you want to do that go for it it works all right that was

02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:49,980
full of your letters all right loki your your setup there sounds really um worrisome

1053
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:57,420
so you know how like you know activision blizzard said hey hey you know that like pve mode yeah

1054
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:01,020
that's coming with overwatch 2 and then they're like no it's not coming with overwatch 2 then

1055
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:05,660
they're like oh hey yeah we're gonna work on it again well now they're the news is out that

1056
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:12,140
it ain't actually part of overwatch 2 unless you pony up the money for it because it's going to

1057
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:17,820
cost you fifteen dollars as part of the invasion bundle and that gives you permanent access to

1058
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:24,060
overwatch 2 invasion story missions 1000 overwatch coins and a brand new sojourn

1059
02:04:24,060 --> 02:04:29,980
legendary skin or if you want to shove more money to the activision you can get the overwatch

1060
02:04:30,620 --> 02:04:37,100
2 ultimate invasion bundle for forty dollars it gives you a null sector premium battle pass with

1061
02:04:37,100 --> 02:04:44,940
20 battle pass skips an additional 1000 overwatch coins for a total of 2000 overwatch coins and two

1062
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:52,940
additional legendary skins for cassidy and kuriko i was against by the way like it's a 38

1063
02:04:52,940 --> 02:04:59,820
value so that's some expensive 17 dollar skins i would rather go give that money to a slot machine

1064
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:06,780
so yeah so hey yeah they'll bring your you know pve mode that was supposed to be included with

1065
02:05:06,780 --> 02:05:11,180
that game but it's going to cost you like you're buying another game anyways for that prize

1066
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:17,340
i want to waste they've just they've really screwed the pooch on the messaging with that

1067
02:05:17,340 --> 02:05:21,580
game and i understand they had some creative director changes and things but i don't know

1068
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:27,420

1128
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:46,700
of course i gotta hoard myself out everywhere uh my final thought is hoping my voice holds out i

1129
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:51,340
want to do another at least one more diablo 4 stream this week and then of course i'll be

1130
02:11:51,340 --> 02:11:56,140
streaming the shit out of final fantasy 16 once that game releases on thursday i'm sure a lot of

1131
02:11:56,140 --> 02:12:01,420
people will be but even if i only have one viewer i'm gonna stick with it i really am and then also

1132
02:12:01,420 --> 02:12:06,140
they're not paying me to say it but like these doctor pepper strawberry drinks strawberry cream

1133
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:11,500
are actually really fucking good they taste like strawberries speaking of that i saw a new coke

1134
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:17,580
flavor that was it was league of legends ultimate yeah okay yeah so we've been trying to figure out

1135
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:21,740
what that flavor is we bought it and we're like what now keep in mind we drink the zero sugar

1136
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:27,100
versions because you know i i can't really have the sugar but when i first had it i was like oh

1137
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:32,380
it's like the lemon but i feel like there's like orange and lime in this too i thought it was coke

1138
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:37,100
mixed with five alive that's honestly what i thought it was but when i read this on the

1139
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:41,420
internet i was like oh no that's a distinct taste and that is exactly what this is

1140
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:44,300
it's coke banana laffy taffy

1141
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:54,220
that's yeah try it tell me what you think but if you don't like banana

1142
02:12:54,220 --> 02:13:00,460
laffy taffy i don't think you'll like it this is a very distinct chemical banana taste to it so

1143
02:13:01,900 --> 02:13:09,420
all right uh okay that's it um we're gonna wrap up have a great week everybody happy gaming
