WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.560
It's a weird time in history right now.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.040
Writers Guild on strike, League of Legends pros on strike, Rail workers denied the right

00:15.040 --> 00:18.480
to strike, French workers striking, Bobby Kotick claiming there has never been a systemic

00:18.480 --> 00:22.020
harassment issue after paying 50 million to settle claims that they did and didn't have

00:22.020 --> 00:24.040
procedures in place to deal with the fact that they did.

00:24.040 --> 00:26.520
I don't have a solution and won't resort to a pithy quip.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.380
Society is complicated.

00:28.380 --> 00:29.860
Some of these headlines are in tonight's news.

00:29.860 --> 00:32.940
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

00:32.940 --> 00:35.820
them and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every

00:35.820 --> 00:37.820
gamer has a voice.

00:37.820 --> 00:44.660
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:44.660 --> 00:47.140
where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.140 --> 00:54.460
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 962 of our

00:54.460 --> 00:58.440
program for tonight, June the 4th of 2023.

00:58.440 --> 01:03.580
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here live each and every Sunday night when we record

01:03.580 --> 01:04.940
with my co-hosts.

01:04.940 --> 01:08.580
Say hello first and foremost to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:08.580 --> 01:10.580
No, I'm Pigmeg.

01:10.580 --> 01:11.580
Yeah.

01:11.580 --> 01:14.620
So okay, but the people on podcast don't get that.

01:14.620 --> 01:19.180
So you're being represented by a picture tonight because it sounds like both you and I have

01:19.180 --> 01:20.660
had a week.

01:20.660 --> 01:21.660
You start.

01:21.660 --> 01:22.660
Okay.

01:22.660 --> 01:29.100
So I've made it no secret that I have myalgic encephalomyelitis, which is also known colloquially

01:29.100 --> 01:32.940
as chronic fatigue syndrome.

01:32.940 --> 01:40.220
And since starting ballet, I actually ran out of two of my medications and I started

01:40.220 --> 01:42.580
taking them again very recently.

01:42.580 --> 01:48.300
And partly as a result, I'm having dizzy spells after activity.

01:48.300 --> 01:59.460
Not all the time, but I did a combination of like an hour and 15 minutes of yoga, Pilates,

01:59.460 --> 02:03.500
bar exercise, weight training, and my cool down.

02:03.500 --> 02:11.420
So because I mean, I basically do like mixed movement and then bar exercise to try to get

02:11.420 --> 02:12.420
my turnout.

02:12.420 --> 02:16.420
Today was the day I was working on my turnout.

02:16.420 --> 02:23.220
And I sat down for a little bit and just dizzy spell and I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not going

02:23.220 --> 02:28.900
to be able to do makeup or stand up while my hands are shaking.

02:28.900 --> 02:32.740
So I just like, I don't want to be on cam.

02:32.740 --> 02:39.140
So this little avatar I made in Daz 3D.

02:39.140 --> 02:46.860
And I had just put together, you know, kind of a representation of my cosmetic that I

02:46.860 --> 02:50.060
play with Meg in Dead by Daylight, but something a little bit different, but I always use the

02:50.060 --> 02:51.460
pig mask.

02:51.460 --> 02:57.820
So that's actually now my no cam image on my stream, because I use my camera to hide

02:57.820 --> 02:58.820
my perks.

02:58.820 --> 03:02.600
I was gonna say it's big V tube vibes, except the only thing that's missing is bouncing

03:02.600 --> 03:05.540
up and down, like as you're talking and that whole thing, you know, sort of the mouth move.

03:05.540 --> 03:08.460
Well, you wouldn't see the mouth moving under the mask, but maybe like bouncing up and down

03:08.460 --> 03:09.460
or whatever.

03:09.460 --> 03:13.740
The one I'm working on now is going to eventually, hopefully be a Vtuber.

03:13.740 --> 03:14.740
Yeah.

03:14.740 --> 03:15.740
Awesome.

03:15.740 --> 03:19.020
For me, my week, I have been dealing with strep throat actually.

03:19.020 --> 03:22.020
So you're probably wondering what the hell are you doing talking tonight?

03:22.020 --> 03:23.800
Actually I started in antibiotics a few days ago.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.580
My throat is now fine.

03:25.580 --> 03:30.520
What the weird thing that happened is that from strep throat, it now went to what I believe

03:30.520 --> 03:31.700
is a sinus infection.

03:31.700 --> 03:35.580
I can't exactly go to see my doctor on the weekend, so I can't get that properly evaluated

03:35.580 --> 03:36.580
in my own antibiotics.

03:36.580 --> 03:41.540
Anyway, I'm not sure what else they can do, but that is very strange to have a strep

03:41.540 --> 03:45.540
throat because that's not supposed to cause sinus issues, but it's likely that the infection

03:45.540 --> 03:47.700
kind of traveled a little bit.

03:47.700 --> 03:48.700
So that part's kind of weird.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.900
It actually depends on the antibiotic that you're on is why it might not affect your

03:50.900 --> 03:51.900
sinuses.

03:51.900 --> 03:52.980
Oh, interesting.

03:52.980 --> 03:55.700
I think I've taken this for a sinus infection for a Z-Pak.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.700
So it's a pretty common.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.700
Yeah.

03:58.700 --> 04:04.180
I myself, I always start off with doxycycline, but it's always worked for me.

04:04.180 --> 04:06.340
Z-Pak is, well see, I'm allergic to penicillin.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.060
So Z-Pak has always kind of been the first.

04:08.060 --> 04:09.060
Oh, interesting.

04:09.060 --> 04:10.060
Yeah.

04:10.060 --> 04:11.060
So it's that-

04:11.060 --> 04:12.060
And amoxicillin.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.060
Yeah.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.060
Yeah.

04:14.060 --> 04:15.060
Amoxicillin was the one I actually had a reaction to.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.060
So they just say all penicillins.

04:16.060 --> 04:21.900
So Z-Pak and the one you call doxycycline are usually the two go-tos, doxycycline, whatever,

04:21.900 --> 04:24.220
are usually the two go-tos.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.500
Yeah, same.

04:26.500 --> 04:33.460
Actually do you remember when I took amoxicillin and I had that really weird raised skin reaction

04:33.460 --> 04:35.540
that I kept going to the golf club with?

04:35.540 --> 04:36.540
I don't.

04:36.540 --> 04:37.540
It was a while ago.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.540
When I had lucky pneumonia.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.540
That was a while ago.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.540
Wow.

04:40.540 --> 04:41.540
That was a while ago.

04:41.540 --> 04:48.060
I mean, I think it was like 2010, but it itched so badly.

04:48.060 --> 04:51.420
But when I went under the blacklight because I'm so pale, it stretched out my skin and

04:51.420 --> 04:52.420
looked like spiderwebs.

04:52.420 --> 04:53.420
It was kind of cool.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.420
Oh, wow.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.420
That's wild.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.420
Yeah.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.640
No, all my issues happened when I was 12.

04:57.640 --> 05:02.780
I took amoxicillin for something and I got a big rash like everywhere and the doctor

05:02.780 --> 05:04.420
said, all right, no more of that.

05:04.420 --> 05:05.420
So interesting.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.300
It gave me penicillin when I was five and ended up in the E.R.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.300
Oh, my.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.300
Oh, no.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.300
All right.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.300
Well, let's say hello to say hello to somebody who hopefully is happy and healthy.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.300
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.300
Yeah.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.300
I'm all right.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.300
Yeah.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.300
Good.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.300
Good.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.060
Except why on earth would you have that game playing behind you tonight on stream?

05:23.060 --> 05:26.500
Is that that's one to switch I'm watching behind you tonight?

05:26.500 --> 05:31.700
It is because it's just so that you realize that the game actually exists because I completely

05:31.700 --> 05:32.700
forgot about it.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.260
I mean, we're going to talk about.

05:37.580 --> 05:42.220
Once again, Nintendo deciding to bring a sequel to something that, like, really no one cares

05:42.220 --> 05:43.220
about.

05:43.220 --> 05:47.020
Well, you know what, since you transitioned, why don't we get right into it?

05:47.020 --> 05:51.740
I'll just give my usual spiel because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock

05:51.740 --> 05:55.900
Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash Vogue Network

05:55.900 --> 06:00.500
VOG Network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who is back live tonight.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.900
Bobby Black Wolf, by the way, at Summer Games Done Quick, which will be one of our fast

06:04.900 --> 06:10.340
headlines later, but he really went into depth about being there and his participation and

06:10.340 --> 06:11.340
so forth.

06:11.340 --> 06:14.780
So if you have any type of interest in Games Done Quick and kind of what all happens at

06:14.780 --> 06:19.380
the in-person event because it is back in person, he talked a lot about that on his

06:19.380 --> 06:20.380
show tonight.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.340
So I'll kind of give an extra shout out for Bobby tonight.

06:22.340 --> 06:25.380
Stop trying to make one, two switch happen.

06:25.380 --> 06:26.900
It's not going to happen.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.940
Pretty much that's the that.

06:28.940 --> 06:31.100
Let's get into the kickoff topic.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.100
That is it.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.660
They without any fanfare whatsoever, which is the appropriate amount of fanfare to give

06:36.660 --> 06:39.500
one to switch is literally none.

06:39.500 --> 06:44.620
It is out for preorder now on the eShop for twenty nine ninety nine.

06:44.620 --> 06:48.220
It's releasing June 20th.

06:48.220 --> 06:51.900
I could really just like I don't care at all about this game.

06:51.900 --> 06:59.460
It was an awful game and now it's an awful game with a sequel and.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.940
Like you already have like Wii Sports Resort or like not Wii Sports Resort, the Switch

07:03.940 --> 07:10.280
Sports, which is basically Wii Sports, like you don't need this, like you tried this,

07:10.280 --> 07:11.780
you tried to make this happen.

07:11.780 --> 07:12.980
It didn't happen.

07:12.980 --> 07:14.540
No one really wanted it.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.500
And now you put out a sequel to it.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.500
Why?

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
I'm like, why would you do that?

07:18.500 --> 07:24.140
I'm legit surprised this didn't go the HBO Max route, shall we say, of quietly disappearing

07:24.140 --> 07:27.380
content into the night and writing it off and never releasing it.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.740
I'm kind of surprised it didn't go that way.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.500
Just, hey, guess what?

07:31.500 --> 07:37.340
You know, now that you pay an extra money for that Nintendo Switch online, thank you.

07:37.340 --> 07:38.340
Thank you.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.340
And then or whatever it is, you expansion pass.

07:40.340 --> 07:41.340
Now you get this piece.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.620
That's exactly what this should have been.

07:43.620 --> 07:48.100
This should have been a free piece of crap for being a Nintendo Switch online member.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.020
That's exactly what this should be.

07:50.020 --> 07:55.000
It could be both because $29.99 is really not that expensive.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.020
But they could say, but you could get it for free with Nintendo Switch online.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.740
But I don't think that they're doing that.

08:00.740 --> 08:03.900
I really just don't see the selling very well at all.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.620
Well, you know what, some folks in chat are talking about that.

08:06.620 --> 08:11.840
Like Mike Deff says, didn't the physical copies for everybody's one, two Switch sell out?

08:11.840 --> 08:14.360
Like it's awful and all, but it is selling.

08:14.360 --> 08:20.440
There is I honestly think it's people that are looking for a fast and easy party game

08:20.440 --> 08:22.940
that get allured to one to switch.

08:22.940 --> 08:26.340
And I wonder if there will be a similar allure for this, except there's no physical edition

08:26.340 --> 08:27.340
for this.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.800
It's not going to be something that tempts them on the Walmart shelf.

08:29.800 --> 08:34.400
Here's the other weird thing about this that I should point out based off of the screenshot

08:34.400 --> 08:38.080
here are the artwork.

08:38.080 --> 08:41.600
Half of the people have switch controllers or joy cons.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.440
The other half of the people on here have cell phones.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.720
So it sounds to me that it's a game that you can play with your cell phone as well.

08:49.720 --> 08:56.280
They have that is confirmed in the description that your cell phone is, which is something

08:56.280 --> 09:01.080
actually I thought was a brilliant move from Jackbox Games kind of brought that to the

09:01.080 --> 09:03.320
forefront several years ago at this point.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.440
And I think that was brilliant.

09:05.440 --> 09:11.000
So I, I'm not surprised to see another company implementing that.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.520
I'm surprised to see Nintendo be that company.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.640
That's the surprising part.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.640
I'm not surprised at all.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.860
Somebody took a good idea and put it in their own game.

09:19.860 --> 09:24.200
I'm surprised Nintendo did that because they're the ones to usually push their own hardware.

09:24.200 --> 09:31.180
But maybe, you know, again, if they're trying to, to me, there's only one market for this.

09:31.180 --> 09:33.000
There's one market for this.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.480
It is somebody who's throwing a party, has several people over, needs a party game everybody

09:38.480 --> 09:40.940
can play and wants something new to play.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.360
And this is it.

09:42.360 --> 09:48.560
And you know, if you didn't have enough Joy-Cons that everybody could play, you would be probably

09:48.560 --> 09:49.780
hesitant to buy it.

09:49.780 --> 09:53.020
But since it works with cell phones, that's not going to be a problem.

09:53.020 --> 09:54.260
Don't you all have phones?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.400
We all know that meme at this point, but it's true.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.180
Like everybody does have a phone at this point.

09:59.180 --> 10:02.940
But you know, don't they have like the Jackbox Games on the Switch?

10:02.940 --> 10:06.460
So like, I would just play that.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.260
You know, Bobby brings up a really good point in chat as well.

10:09.260 --> 10:14.620
There are lots of Switches that don't have Joy-Cons because if you have the, the one

10:14.620 --> 10:17.740
that Alan has, the Switch Lite or whatever they called it, where it was all together,

10:17.740 --> 10:19.120
you don't have Joy-Cons on that.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.900
So you have to have something else.

10:20.900 --> 10:21.900
Okay.

10:21.900 --> 10:22.900
Okay.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.100
I bet you're not plugging into the TV.

10:26.100 --> 10:29.420
So is everyone going to huddle around a little, a little Switch, let me go.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.900
I can't really see the screen because it's so damn tiny.

10:31.900 --> 10:36.940
But yeah, I think we're doing the thing, you know, like I, like I get it, you can play

10:36.940 --> 10:44.500
through your phone and stuff like that, but like, it just, I, I, whatever.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.500
You know what?

10:45.500 --> 10:46.500
Cool.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.140
You wasted development time on this.

10:48.140 --> 10:53.620
This is why I don't get like one, two Switch gets a sequel and gets development time.

10:53.620 --> 10:59.900
Pikmin gets goddamn how many sequels, you know, for that thing, but like F-Zero, what's

10:59.900 --> 11:00.900
that?

11:00.900 --> 11:01.900
Oh, I don't know.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.820
We just don't make F-Zero games here anymore.

11:03.820 --> 11:09.860
Well, the number again, it's not like everybody's one, or excuse me, it's not like the original

11:09.860 --> 11:11.060
one, two Switch didn't sell.

11:11.060 --> 11:16.580
Now I would argue that was because outside of Zelda, there was very little else to buy,

11:16.580 --> 11:19.100
at least, you know, for that party environment and so forth.

11:19.100 --> 11:22.100
And yes, I'm sure you all are going to come at me with the launch titles, but as far as

11:22.100 --> 11:27.220
Nintendo's first party, and they are very good at getting the game out in front of people,

11:27.220 --> 11:31.860
especially when the Switch was new and they made it, you know, they, here's what I asked.

11:31.860 --> 11:35.540
So I see the quote in chat, the 3 million people bought one, two Switch.

11:35.540 --> 11:38.140
How many of those 3 million people regret that purchase?

11:38.140 --> 11:39.740
That's what I really want to know.

11:39.740 --> 11:44.380
How many people are playing that game still, or how many people like purchased it because

11:44.380 --> 11:48.540
they're like, well, there's no like Wii Sports type games, so I'm going to buy this.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.500
Like look at the game that is behind me right now.

11:51.500 --> 11:54.100
Like let me describe for the audio listeners.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.900
It is a game where you have a chess that's wrapped in chains.

11:56.900 --> 12:00.540
You have to twist your Joy-Con around to unwrap the chains.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.020
That looks goddamn boring.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.100
Like I would not want to play that.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.100
It just, it's stupid.

12:05.100 --> 12:09.420
And watching the people like dress up like pirates do it is just cringey as hell.

12:09.420 --> 12:14.420
Let me ask this question, because if there is the cell phone integration, then none of

12:14.420 --> 12:17.540
this stuff with the vibration can be in it.

12:17.540 --> 12:23.020
So I'm going to be, I'm going to ask this question from, I guess devil's advocate or

12:23.020 --> 12:25.040
whatever you want to call it.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.100
Is it possible that them having to make the regular cell phones a controller as well will

12:30.140 --> 12:34.500
actually make the games better because they can't just rely on the gimmicks?

12:36.500 --> 12:37.940
No, I doubt it.

12:38.220 --> 12:42.100
I honestly doubt it, because if they thought it was going to be a good game, they'd be

12:42.100 --> 12:43.700
charging more than $29.99.

12:44.340 --> 12:48.700
They have no confidence on it, so they didn't spend any marketing budget or very

12:48.700 --> 12:49.780
little marketing budget.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.740
It's not even announced in a direct.

12:52.020 --> 12:57.180
It's not even something that they would throw in in their like random like directs that

12:57.180 --> 12:58.540
they were doing, like with indie games.

12:58.540 --> 13:01.980
They're like not even indie games, but like other things like, hey, this is coming out.

13:03.260 --> 13:07.380
Guy, because they can't because they honestly can't say, hey, guys, I know you guys are

13:07.380 --> 13:10.060
waiting for a sequel, the sequel you've all been asking for.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.140
It's like F zero mother.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.260
No, another retro game.

13:14.260 --> 13:18.100
No, any of your excite bike?

13:18.100 --> 13:18.740
No.

13:18.740 --> 13:19.500
Oh, one, two.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.340
Oh, oh, OK.

13:21.380 --> 13:27.020
I yeah, I'm just of the mindset that like rather than release it for $30, I bet more

13:27.020 --> 13:31.020
people would play it if they made it free with switch online, you know, and maybe, you

13:31.020 --> 13:33.980
know, again, it's about making money and they probably figure they're going to get those

13:33.980 --> 13:38.340
switch online dollars anyway, because people are going to pay the online, although Zelda

13:38.340 --> 13:39.340
doesn't really have online.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.180
Right. So they got it.

13:40.180 --> 13:44.980
They got to know they're they're they're maintaining those online fees from somewhere.

13:44.980 --> 13:46.620
I don't know, but OK.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.980
Yeah. Yeah. Bobby saying the games are too expensive.

13:48.980 --> 13:50.020
Here's a $30 game.

13:50.020 --> 13:52.460
If you thought it was good, you'd make it more expensive.

13:52.460 --> 13:55.660
Well, yeah, because I don't want to pay $30 for a crappy game.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.380
I can pay $30 for a good indie game.

13:58.740 --> 14:01.100
Sure. Yeah, I have a lot more enjoyment over it.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.820
Like one to switch is just bottom of the barrel garbage.

14:04.860 --> 14:09.660
This is this is something like if it was literally some other like random third party

14:09.660 --> 14:13.700
company that made shovelware put this out, I wouldn't be surprised that that was from

14:13.700 --> 14:17.860
them. The fact that Nintendo has their name on it doesn't make it a quality game.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.340
It was just not good.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.620
Yeah, well, we'll see when the reviews come out.

14:22.620 --> 14:28.820
But again, I just I don't you know, I say that and I don't usually put stock in in

14:28.820 --> 14:34.580
reviews, but I just feel like a lot of these the lower price tag, which Nintendo really

14:34.580 --> 14:40.300
does, not even being in a direct straight to the store, like all of these signs point

14:40.300 --> 14:43.820
out, this is the equivalent of a Nintendo write off like this.

14:44.060 --> 14:49.260
This is it. They're they're firing this one late into the night and it is what it is.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.260
And I fully expect the reviews are going to say this game is crap.

14:52.980 --> 15:00.300
And we might sound hateful or whatever, but I really think our prediction here is not

15:00.300 --> 15:01.740
without merit.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.460
I don't crap.

15:04.380 --> 15:07.660
If it's not, then what a pleasant surprise that would be, then great.

15:07.660 --> 15:10.700
I would be excited that, hey, it's only thirty dollars.

15:10.700 --> 15:17.140
That's a great deal. But, you know, like Loki points out, even though, yeah, thirty

15:17.140 --> 15:18.460
dollars is cheaper game.

15:18.460 --> 15:22.020
And for the most part, we're happy to see that it's difficult to get excited when you're

15:22.020 --> 15:25.660
looking at Jackbox Games, which the party packs are what are they?

15:25.660 --> 15:27.060
Nineteen ninety nine for the party.

15:27.180 --> 15:31.220
I don't I don't legit know what they cost right now, but there may be 19, maybe twenty

15:31.220 --> 15:36.540
four ninety nine. And I would I would say I enjoyed any of those packs, any of them

15:36.540 --> 15:37.900
better than I did one to switch.

15:38.460 --> 15:42.260
Yeah. You want to get me excited about something that would be like a party game for

15:42.260 --> 15:43.900
the switch and you can involve cell phones.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.540
Make me another WarioWare game.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.740
Could you do that with the cell phones?

15:48.740 --> 15:51.820
And that would probably work for some of the touch screen stuff.

15:51.820 --> 15:55.260
You could probably do little micro games and stuff and send it through there and have

15:55.260 --> 15:56.740
some sort of interaction with that.

15:57.140 --> 16:00.700
But like that's a better franchise than this.

16:00.700 --> 16:01.860
This is just garbage.

16:01.900 --> 16:05.380
This is I just don't see this being a thing.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.220
Actually, you bring up an interesting idea.

16:08.220 --> 16:14.580
Like what if Nintendo were to take the cell phone thing and put it in some other games?

16:14.580 --> 16:17.020
Like I just I think I'm still sitting here shot going.

16:17.020 --> 16:19.540
I just I never saw Nintendo doing this in the first place.

16:19.660 --> 16:23.340
So for me to think like, oh, would they make a WarioWare game that you could control with

16:23.340 --> 16:25.980
your phone? Like I'm like, no, they would never do that.

16:25.980 --> 16:29.380
But I'm like, well, but I didn't think they'd do this either.

16:29.780 --> 16:36.500
You know, could they do something that maybe they try to attract people with phones to get

16:36.500 --> 16:39.580
more of those, you know, party in person type of games?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.740
I don't know. I don't know.

16:41.740 --> 16:48.460
But the other thing to point out is that we this this release is also surprising because

16:48.500 --> 16:53.220
it's literally the only new game we know that's coming for Switch first party right now.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.260
We don't know what else is on Nintendo's agenda.

16:56.260 --> 17:02.420
So, again, this does feel very get it out there before they're going to reset the palette

17:02.420 --> 17:04.860
and tell us the games we're really excited for.

17:04.860 --> 17:06.020
When does this come out again, Loki?

17:06.020 --> 17:06.540
The end of June?

17:07.260 --> 17:12.300
It's on the 20th. And so, yeah, by the time like if they do, probably the next week is

17:12.300 --> 17:13.380
when we get a Nintendo Direct.

17:13.660 --> 17:17.220
So if we get a Nintendo Direct, you're literally going to forget that this game exists

17:17.220 --> 17:19.020
again, like you're going to hear the other games.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.020
You're like, oh, cool.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.860
You know, I'm gonna look forward to that and then just immediately forget that this thing

17:22.860 --> 17:25.060
exists like you did the original one to switch.

17:25.260 --> 17:29.220
Yeah. But if the Nintendo Direct is before the 20th, and then we already know we're going

17:29.220 --> 17:35.340
to see the footage for this game, which is still a possibility, Nintendo still may just in

17:35.340 --> 17:41.540
the. They have to show they're trying to make money and, you know, that build an awareness

17:41.540 --> 17:45.780
again, they will probably show some footage for the game and stress the cell phone thing

17:45.780 --> 17:46.860
an instant party.

17:47.340 --> 17:52.940
If you want to have an immediate party just by this game type of thing, I could see them

17:52.940 --> 17:55.540
doing that if the direct is before the 20th.

17:57.060 --> 18:01.780
But I still want to know what the hell Nintendo is doing for the holiday.

18:01.940 --> 18:05.580
I do not believe there is nothing for the holiday.

18:05.620 --> 18:07.740
I do not believe there is nothing for the holiday.

18:07.900 --> 18:15.700
How? The only way the only way I would believe that is if Nintendo says it's because

18:15.740 --> 18:21.180
we're targeting Switch successor for first quarter 2014, then I would believe that there's

18:21.180 --> 18:22.060
nothing for the holiday.

18:22.700 --> 18:27.900
But I just I know I know what everybody's saying, what the rumors said and what Nintendo

18:27.900 --> 18:29.100
has even gone record saying.

18:29.340 --> 18:35.500
I just I it blows my mind or there or they're going to really rest on a third party.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.580
That could be two.

18:36.580 --> 18:38.940
There could be some big third party announcements.

18:38.940 --> 18:44.500
I just don't know what they'd be, but maybe something like Xenoblade Chronicles X, because

18:44.500 --> 18:46.420
they still didn't have a remade that one.

18:46.420 --> 18:50.020
They could, you know, do a remaster of that for the Switch could come out for holiday.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.500
You know, there might be a few of those things that they could kind of pull on.

18:53.500 --> 18:58.020
I guess Xenoblade would be more second party, but still, you know, there might there might

18:58.020 --> 19:02.260
be some things they can kind of pull out to to to band aid the holiday until the Switch

19:02.260 --> 19:03.180
successor happens.

19:03.580 --> 19:08.380
So. Yeah, Deidre Omez says Mario Kart 9.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.900
And yeah, I agree with Bobby.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.860
They're not going to release Mario Kart 9 while they're still releasing waves of Mario

19:12.860 --> 19:13.980
Kart 8 DLC.

19:14.220 --> 19:18.540
I don't see how they release Mario Kart 9 for the Switch at this point, unless it's a

19:18.540 --> 19:21.020
hybrid game with whatever the successor is.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.540
You know, I hope the successor is fully backwards compatible.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.940
We shouldn't count on it, but I think we all hope it is.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.980
I think it would be a damn shame if something like Tears of the Kingdom wasn't playable on

19:30.980 --> 19:31.900
the next console.

19:33.180 --> 19:34.740
But we'll see. I don't know.

19:35.980 --> 19:42.060
I would again, and I've said this before on the show, I'll make it quick, the low hanging

19:42.100 --> 19:47.780
fruit, quote unquote, game to release, in my opinion, that kind of blows my mind that

19:47.780 --> 19:55.300
they haven't done it this year is Mario Odyssey 2, especially with Mario movie having

19:55.300 --> 19:59.740
been this year. And now the Blu-ray coming out in a couple of weeks.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.860
Right. In fact, I actually know it's like next week because I think somebody in Discord

20:02.860 --> 20:07.020
was saying the Best Buy like shifted to people's homes already, like broke street on it

20:07.020 --> 20:12.620
or whatever. I'm still kind of blown away that there was no tie in Mario product for the

20:12.620 --> 20:21.100
Mario movie. So again, I would think a Mario Odyssey 2 or something in the Mario

20:21.100 --> 20:24.100
universe is the holiday title.

20:25.060 --> 20:26.700
But what do I know?

20:28.580 --> 20:31.300
Although I have had a lot of predictions come true this year, I'm just saying.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.580
Nothing. All right.

20:34.980 --> 20:38.180
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

20:38.180 --> 20:40.500
this week, whether it's one to switch or something else.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.580
Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.500
We have Black Knight Sword of Rage.

20:46.980 --> 20:51.260
We have the pro version and I've been playing some of that and it pisses me off.

20:52.940 --> 20:58.300
Been playing through Marvel's Midnight Suns on my second playthrough, doing a light

20:58.300 --> 21:01.740
play through and I've got Storm and she's amazing.

21:02.980 --> 21:06.940
But I think also her voice actress was Sindel, I think.

21:06.940 --> 21:07.940
I'll have to double check.

21:09.460 --> 21:14.500
But I'm just finding a lot of like the Netherrealm crossovers is kind of interesting.

21:15.940 --> 21:19.260
But at any rate, I've been enjoying that.

21:19.260 --> 21:21.620
I'm still doing, of course, Dead by Daylight.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.540
Probably going to work on my Adept some more.

21:26.380 --> 21:27.980
And did the.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.340
What else is I playing?

21:30.340 --> 21:32.780
Oh, yeah, Cult of the Lamb, which I love.

21:34.780 --> 21:37.620
I played seven hours of Midnight Suns.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.340
I didn't go to bed until like 4 a.m.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.220
You were streaming late.

21:42.060 --> 21:48.860
Yeah, well, Dan was staying up and he was going to let me know when the finale was up for.

21:48.860 --> 21:50.780
Oh, yeah.

21:50.780 --> 21:57.820
Game stone quick ended late for us and early for that because it was like five or six in the morning for them.

21:57.820 --> 22:02.660
He passed out and finally I just could not keep my eyes open anymore.

22:02.660 --> 22:16.980
I was just really fading and like I didn't get up until one today because I mean, it's why my submissions were so bare was because I barely could remember my name.

22:16.980 --> 22:19.340
It was.

22:20.540 --> 22:26.620
It was like the fatigue was like to the point I actually couldn't get out of my chair.

22:28.140 --> 22:35.580
So if no one knows what the feeling of having your muscles ache to the point where you literally cannot move.

22:36.620 --> 22:37.620
That's where I was.

22:38.620 --> 22:40.620
And I actually.

22:41.980 --> 22:53.020
Finally, after a little bit, managed to conserve enough that I could get up and go to bed, Michigan's Midnight Suns is a great game, and you can read all about it on the Internet.

22:54.940 --> 22:55.540
I'm kidding.

22:56.540 --> 23:09.860
It's it's a Marvel sort of strategy RPG-ish kind of game where you have like a card deck that dictates your moves to use in the battle sequences.

23:11.060 --> 23:23.500
And you can do like story things and other things to like gain experience and gain items that will help you out and boost you up and all of this stuff.

23:23.500 --> 23:28.420
And then you kind of not romance people, you kind of make friends with them.

23:28.980 --> 23:32.460
It's just making friends, although some of them totally flirt with you.

23:32.460 --> 23:37.380
Like, I seriously think that Morbius just is a flirt, like an unapologetic flirt.

23:39.620 --> 23:40.220
It's great.

23:42.100 --> 23:47.420
I was trying to get some B-roll of the game up for one of your streams, but for whatever reason, it was taking a sweet time.

23:47.420 --> 23:51.500
But for those watching live on Twitch, there's some a Dark Soccer stream from last night.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.700
So you see a little bit of what the game looks like.

23:53.700 --> 23:59.300
So you can kind of see like it's the part where I burped into the mic, they don't hear the audio anyway.

24:00.260 --> 24:00.980
It's just the video.

24:00.980 --> 24:15.060
But you can see that you're like you kind of like you have a battlefield fight RPG thing like, I don't know, Chrono Trigger, but you're using cards to actually make the plays, which is interesting.

24:15.060 --> 24:17.900
It's not just like fight, magic, run, right?

24:17.900 --> 24:21.260
It's you're using cards to make your different plays, which is interesting.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.380
It's a different way to do it, right?

24:22.900 --> 24:26.620
And you have to be able to use your environment or combo your cards.

24:27.060 --> 24:39.500
Like one thing that I like is that you eventually get the ability for your party members to be an obstacle that causes damage to the others instead of them getting hurt when you knock some money into them.

24:40.500 --> 24:46.980
But like some of the major characters, you know, were corrupted, like in this clip, it's Scarlet Witch was corrupted.

24:49.220 --> 24:54.380
And like Venom, Sabretooth, those are the big ones.

24:54.380 --> 24:59.540
You fight Dracula, Mephisto, you know, some big Marvel names.

24:59.540 --> 25:07.940
And I like that the continuity of it sort of it's mostly comic continuity, but it's its own universes continuity as well.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.740
It's not like MCU style, though.

25:09.740 --> 25:14.220
There are some some touches, you know, I think it's a great game.

25:14.220 --> 25:21.620
I mean, I have zero regrets for having bought the legendary edition for a hundred bucks when they came out.

25:22.540 --> 25:25.020
All right. And Storm, oh, my God.

25:25.220 --> 25:30.860
So I love Deadpool and Morbius is OK and Venom is OK.

25:31.460 --> 25:34.540
But Storm, oh, she's amazing.

25:35.380 --> 25:39.540
All right, that's it for your gaming week, we'll go over to Loki.

25:40.580 --> 25:46.300
Yep, more Minecraft just been plugging away, but an episode this week

25:47.980 --> 25:55.580
built the giant metal giant met that's from Mega Man three, I think it's a mid boss that has giant

25:57.340 --> 25:59.380
was thrusters, I guess, on the bottom of it.

25:59.380 --> 26:02.500
So that was kind of fun. A big quarry.

26:02.500 --> 26:07.460
Yeah, still working on more stuff for my season, trying to wrap things up.

26:09.580 --> 26:18.460
And if folks want to check out your build video, of course, they can go to your YouTube over at Loki underscore O.L.R., right?

26:18.620 --> 26:20.300
No underscore, just Loki O.L.R.

26:20.500 --> 26:24.580
Oh, because I went to because I was just pulling the video and I did underscore Loki O.L.R.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.900
and it worked, but whatever weird.

26:28.740 --> 26:29.900
But yeah, you can check out the bill.

26:29.900 --> 26:35.100
I was trying to see if I could show a little part in that video, because this is where you're kind of like in the weeds, maybe here.

26:35.140 --> 26:36.820
Yeah, there there's the giant metal.

26:36.820 --> 26:38.020
Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

26:38.020 --> 26:39.140
Wow. Look at that. Sorry.

26:39.140 --> 26:46.780
Sorry to those on the podcast feed, but just imagine I'm showing a very elaborate Minecraft build where Loki is kind of like in this pit.

26:47.020 --> 26:51.300
There's like a tiny little door that he's going in that I imagine kind of helps him get back up to the top.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.620
And you can see where the storage room is.

26:53.620 --> 26:55.900
There's a farm farm in the giant metal.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.500
It drops stuff out of the bottom of it.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.060
Got it. Got it.

26:59.060 --> 27:04.140
But but yeah, there's a really cool little Mega Man guy that floats up there at the top.

27:04.140 --> 27:05.820
And yeah, this is this is great.

27:05.820 --> 27:08.300
You do these such elaborate builds are so cool.

27:08.860 --> 27:10.820
So I hope more people check them out.

27:12.100 --> 27:15.540
God, just look how vast the Minecraft world is.

27:16.340 --> 27:17.860
Sometimes you really.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.820
Yeah, the size is just incredible.

27:20.060 --> 27:21.820
Anyway. All right.

27:23.460 --> 27:25.020
So that's it, just Minecraft for you.

27:26.460 --> 27:27.780
Yep, just Minecraft.

27:28.100 --> 27:32.980
All right. My gaming week again, I've been kind of sick, so it's cut into my time a little bit.

27:32.980 --> 27:37.460
But, you know, I was all over Diablo 4, which, of course, had early access this week.

27:37.460 --> 27:47.620
So speaking about paying one hundred dollars for the ultimate edition of the game, I paid the fee to get in and do the early access in Diablo, which I have been playing quite a bit.

27:48.020 --> 27:52.420
Not as much as some people I know, because like yesterday I couldn't even sit down and focus.

27:52.420 --> 27:56.580
I had so much sinus pressure, like right in that place that sucks to have sinus pressure.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.940
So, like, I couldn't focus for long periods of time.

27:59.940 --> 28:03.180
But everywhere is horrible.

28:03.180 --> 28:06.020
But anyway, I did beat act two.

28:06.020 --> 28:07.140
I did that earlier today.

28:07.140 --> 28:15.060
So and act one was the basically the equivalent of the demo or the beta that was out before.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.580
That was how much story was available.

28:16.580 --> 28:18.700
So I've been able to play a little more and go through act two.

28:19.500 --> 28:26.540
And I don't know if I have a lot else to say about this game that I didn't already say when I was talking about the beta, because obviously I've gotten to sample it a little bit.

28:26.980 --> 28:33.140
But, you know, just to recap, I think this is more rooted in Diablo two than it is Diablo three.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.860
I don't think being rooted in Diablo three is a bad thing.

28:35.860 --> 28:41.500
I love Diablo three, but I realize a lot of people kind of missed some of the parts of two when they went to three.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.940
And I think this is more rooted in two.

28:43.940 --> 28:45.580
And I think there's a lot of people that are going to enjoy that.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.820
But it has a lot of the quality of life stuff from three.

28:48.660 --> 28:54.260
The open world stuff is very interesting because that's the only part that's like a little weird because it isn't randomized.

28:54.580 --> 28:56.300
The overworld is always the same.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.100
It is gigantic, though.

28:58.300 --> 29:07.180
And there are all of these dungeons that you can go in, excuse me, and those are randomized and everything else that you do, like a classic Diablo game is randomized.

29:07.220 --> 29:11.180
My understanding is once you get into end game, then you'll go in some of those areas.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.900
And that's kind of like end game is running those randomized.

29:13.900 --> 29:20.740
But with affixes, it sounds a lot like mythic dungeon runs in World of Warcraft.

29:21.380 --> 29:26.180
I hope to be able to speak more on that in a week when I have assumably beaten the story.

29:27.020 --> 29:29.460
I'll be streaming it on my own feed throughout the week this week.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.420
They're going to be doing some Twitch drops this week, by the way.

29:31.900 --> 29:38.220
So I would encourage you, if you have any interest in Diablo at all, watch the streams to get the draw.

29:38.220 --> 29:41.060
I guess eat KFC, if you must, to get those drops as well.

29:41.060 --> 29:43.300
But if you want to collect that stuff, if you don't, then whatever.

29:43.300 --> 29:46.820
It's just I don't think they do anything besides really cosmetics.

29:47.580 --> 29:49.780
That is the one thing, by the way, with Diablo 4.

29:49.780 --> 30:04.060
I have to agree with a lot of the stuff I've been reading that it is unfortunate that they kind of put all that cosmetic pay stuff in there because it's ridiculous when they've already paying $70 for the game.

30:04.500 --> 30:17.980
But at least it is confined to its own little menu, its own little shop, and it isn't something where like you have to click through a pop up or anything like that, or it doesn't try to coax you the way a lot of free to play games will.

30:18.700 --> 30:19.740
It doesn't do any of that.

30:19.740 --> 30:22.820
So I will say at least it kind of puts it in its own little corner.

30:23.140 --> 30:33.820
The one thing I don't like is that if you're like me and you can't stand to see notifications, so like you will know that you have a new quest unlocked.

30:33.820 --> 30:36.500
There's a little notification thing in that tab, so you want to go clear it.

30:36.980 --> 30:39.620
The shop tab always has new notifications in it.

30:40.260 --> 30:46.020
So that little like part of me that like wants to clear all my notifications can't do it without going to the shop.

30:46.020 --> 30:47.500
That's how they get you.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.460
But otherwise, it's whatever.

30:51.780 --> 30:54.220
I'll be interested to see what they do with the battle pass.

30:54.220 --> 30:59.180
That's going to be very interesting when that, but I guess that's tied to seasonal content.

31:00.420 --> 31:06.340
And, you know, Dead by Daylight has battle passes and it's all cosmetics and I don't mind it.

31:06.340 --> 31:10.540
So I'll kind of be curious to see if it's a similar system in Diablo, which I believe it's supposed to be.

31:10.860 --> 31:16.060
It's just, you know, how many of these season achievements you do basically tie into how much of the battle pass stuff you unlock.

31:16.380 --> 31:17.700
And it is all cosmetics.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.820
But yeah, I'm playing a druid and my druid is through act two.

31:21.820 --> 31:23.820
My druid is level forty one.

31:23.820 --> 31:28.060
No. Thirty nine, I think just before forty.

31:30.220 --> 31:31.220
I think I went the wrong way.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.580
It's a tractor level, not at a level.

31:33.100 --> 31:39.300
My druid is level thirty nine and just got through act two because I'm one of those people that's like, I have to do every side quest.

31:39.300 --> 31:40.900
I have to find every Lilith statue.

31:40.900 --> 31:41.780
I have to do all these things.

31:42.020 --> 31:53.540
But I finally got myself to stop doing that because the bonuses that you get in each zone stop at a certain point and you have to be in world tier three, which is a higher level to unlock the highest stuff.

31:53.900 --> 32:01.020
So basically I said, OK, I will allow myself to go side quest adventure to get my two skill points that you get and then I'm stopping.

32:01.580 --> 32:05.020
So that's that's what I just finished in the second zone.

32:05.020 --> 32:08.500
I beat act two and then I got my second skill point from the zone.

32:08.500 --> 32:15.980
So later tonight I will probably go and play act three and see how far I can get with that tonight.

32:16.660 --> 32:19.420
Mishkins in chat says there's going to be a battle pass for D4.

32:19.420 --> 32:20.540
Oh, Lord. Yep.

32:21.860 --> 32:25.420
But again, it's supposedly all cosmetic.

32:25.820 --> 32:26.900
That's what they promised.

32:26.900 --> 32:34.020
So if that's what it stays as, then I don't think it's going to be too big an issue because the character creator is pretty good.

32:34.940 --> 32:38.780
You'll probably you've probably seen a lot of people on social media sharing the characters that they've made.

32:39.100 --> 32:42.540
You can make a lot of diverse, different types of characters.

32:43.220 --> 32:48.940
In Diablo three, every character kind of had their default and you couldn't really customize that.

32:49.260 --> 32:54.020
Now they don't have a default druid or a default barbarian.

32:54.300 --> 32:59.820
It is always when you're on the character select screen, it is always randomized, the characters that are sitting there.

33:00.060 --> 33:06.700
So you can see different looking people anytime you look at the menu of a class select, which I think is interesting.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.260
I like that they kind of mix it up like that.

33:08.700 --> 33:14.700
So Mish in chat says I made a second character because I'm like you, Rob, I do everything I can.

33:15.020 --> 33:18.860
I'll make a second character, too, eventually, but I'll wait for the season content to do it.

33:19.100 --> 33:22.460
When the season content drops, then I'll make a second character.

33:22.460 --> 33:29.300
And, you know, because I assume that season characters will roll into regular like before.

33:29.860 --> 33:33.180
Other than that, I've also been playing more Final Fantasy 14.

33:33.220 --> 33:44.980
I should get my island sanctuary to rank 14 tonight because that's my end game content is island sanctuary or the, I guess, animal crossing for lack of it's more like farm simulator or something is more like what it is.

33:45.780 --> 33:48.300
What are the what is the name of that big farming game?

33:48.500 --> 33:49.620
Why is the name escape me?

33:50.020 --> 33:51.860
Harvest Moon. It's more Harvest Moon than that.

33:53.220 --> 33:55.460
But I'll get to that tonight.

33:55.460 --> 33:58.340
And I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, just a little.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.700
But I did get Jane to prestige one.

34:02.180 --> 34:05.900
I only have a handful of characters left to art at prestige one and Jane was one of them.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.460
So I got my adept Jane as well.

34:07.500 --> 34:21.740
So, yeah, I should also mention what Dead by Daylight they did a big pride stream earlier this week and they released a lot of charm content that are related to Pride Month.

34:21.980 --> 34:30.500
So meaning like, you know, charms are things that your survivor can wear on their little belt or, you know, belt area or killers.

34:31.180 --> 34:33.260
Yeah, killers can have them on their hook.

34:33.620 --> 34:39.420
So most Lijabodqua people had the rainbow charms.

34:39.420 --> 34:47.500
But now, like Dark Saga just said, you can have an ace charm if you want to have an ace charm or a pan flag if you want to have that or trans flags.

34:47.500 --> 34:52.700
They released a lot of different identities within the spectrum this week.

34:52.700 --> 35:00.100
And that's really cool for those that, you know, want to use those and further identify or what have you.

35:00.100 --> 35:06.780
And I think they also released another rainbow charm that was like an eye that looked pretty cool, too, like a more generalized pride charm that was neat.

35:06.980 --> 35:13.300
So there is the one thing to bring up we had touched on before.

35:13.300 --> 35:13.980
Yeah, please.

35:14.660 --> 35:29.780
Yeah, so Pupers was, you know, a big figure in the community, one of the early fog whisperers, you know, the representatives of the game and just a really all around great person.

35:29.780 --> 35:37.380
And he finally died on the second from ALS complications of ALS.

35:38.380 --> 35:49.780
And so, on that note, you know, we just want to offer our empathy to family and friends, the people who knew him the best.

35:49.780 --> 35:59.380
And also, you know, a show of support for the community, for everyone who he touched.

35:59.380 --> 36:00.780
He is definitely a light in the fog.

36:01.380 --> 36:04.980
Yeah, a lot of people in the Twitch community feeling lost this week, for sure.

36:04.980 --> 36:07.060
And may his memory be a blessing.

36:08.060 --> 36:08.860
All right.

36:10.260 --> 36:14.260
I think that's everything to say on my gaming week.

36:14.260 --> 36:16.900
So let's get into some news.

36:17.380 --> 36:18.420
I'm going to turn it again.

36:18.420 --> 36:23.100
The show is probably going to be a little shorter tonight, just because I'm feeling kind of bled or sacros feeling kind of bled.

36:23.300 --> 36:26.580
But we do have some news we want to get through and talk about some of the headlines this week.

36:26.580 --> 36:28.700
So, Loki, I'm going to let you start it off.

36:33.380 --> 36:34.020
Right, Loki?

36:34.860 --> 36:35.660
I'm sorry, what was that?

36:35.940 --> 36:37.020
You started off, right?

36:37.140 --> 36:37.620
Yeah.

36:37.620 --> 36:43.860
Yep, meta quest three, I think I've been actually waiting for because I wanted to pick up a new VR headset.

36:43.860 --> 36:48.620
And I know that they were going to be announcing a new meta quest three.

36:48.620 --> 36:50.420
And now here we go.

36:50.980 --> 37:04.860
So the quest three is going to be coming out this fall, starting at $500, along with that they're gonna be dropping the price of the quest to down $100 again, so they raised it and now it's back down again.

37:04.860 --> 37:06.780
So that's interesting.

37:07.620 --> 37:20.100
Looks like it has more front facing cameras, a more powerful Snapdragon processor in as well, it's going to be capable of doing some AR stuff as well, which is kind of cool.

37:20.580 --> 37:38.620
And then on top of that, they're going to be also doing a patch, or I guess not really a patch, a firmware update for the quest to, to actually bump up the power of it by like, I think 20-25% or up to 25% more.

37:38.620 --> 37:41.780
So that's kind of nice for folks who have the the older one.

37:41.780 --> 37:52.100
Let's see, yeah, so $500 for the 128 gigabyte storage version, and then 256, no price on that yet.

37:52.100 --> 38:08.220
But it is interesting to see, you know that it is, I mean, I'm curious to check out to see how much better it is, because I know my VR headset is pretty old, and I would like a new one that can sit in the box that I probably won't ever use.

38:08.220 --> 38:12.140
But it's nice to know that I'll have one in case I do want to use it.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.460
My kids are always saying, are you going to get us one?

38:15.460 --> 38:20.180
I'm like, you already have a quest to that I bought you like six months ago, so shut up.

38:22.140 --> 38:32.180
But yeah, the they've got, yeah, 40% smaller than the quest to it's got the same pancake lens optics from the quest pro.

38:32.180 --> 38:37.300
So that's cool, even better visuals and a higher resolution display.

38:37.340 --> 38:44.420
And they said much higher resolution quality pass through cameras now in color, assisted with a special depth sensor.

38:44.420 --> 38:49.260
So that's going to be hopefully for AR, possibly.

38:51.020 --> 38:54.580
Maybe we'll have to see some of the games and what they do.

38:55.140 --> 39:05.980
Yes, we will have to see some of those games, including the one that they did promise us last time we talked about VR, and still nothing.

39:06.580 --> 39:24.700
So back on October 28th, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, the lizard man himself, promised that they're going to be working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for VR, to which I said, wow, I don't really care about that because that's going to look like garbage in VR because it's so damn old.

39:24.700 --> 39:30.220
But OK, sure, you know, if that's all I get, then I'm fine with that, I guess.

39:30.740 --> 39:36.780
Um, nothing about the game at all.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.700
So is it coming out?

39:41.180 --> 39:46.460
Hopefully, Grow Street Games isn't working on it because that will be all sorts of awful.

39:49.860 --> 39:54.020
I don't know, I like once again, like until I saw that article, I completely forgot about it.

39:54.020 --> 39:57.420
Yeah, I forgot that that was the thing, too, until that story was making the rounds this week.

39:58.420 --> 40:04.980
It's not really like a really cool thing to have an exclusive like, yeah, it's exclusive Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

40:04.980 --> 40:08.220
I mean, you might as well just do like Grand Theft Auto one at that point.

40:08.220 --> 40:16.220
I mean, it's so old, like, is that really all the quest three can handle is just like San Andreas?

40:16.420 --> 40:23.900
Unless they're doing something real extra to it, which I don't I don't know why they'd have the license to do that, but I would hope not.

40:24.300 --> 40:29.100
Like do like I'd be excited about Grand Theft Auto for VR, like I'd be down for that.

40:29.100 --> 40:35.660
Like that's about as old as I would go with Grand Theft Auto for VR on like one of those headsets.

40:35.820 --> 40:39.780
San Andreas is just too damn old at this point, but that's it's like a remake.

40:39.780 --> 40:45.020
That's also you and you were like a top leaderboard player on Grand Theft Auto four.

40:45.020 --> 40:52.980
So yes, I am hoping someday that Grand Theft Auto four comes back with online support so that I can once again dominate leaderboards again.

40:53.980 --> 40:55.020
That will be my game.

40:55.020 --> 40:58.460
But. But wait, we'll have to wait.

40:59.820 --> 41:08.500
Random aside, real quick, speaking of VR games is not related to what you just talked about, Loki, and technically this isn't about VR, but a game that does play in VR.

41:08.820 --> 41:22.780
Dark Soccer, I thought of you this week because I think I felt like our worlds collided a little bit because No Man's Sky, one of my favorite games that I talk about all the time, teased a lot of you know, they were when

41:23.780 --> 41:32.700
Hello Games wants to tease a new or Sean Murray specifically, when he wants to tease a new game, he uses emojis and he was using a lot of Apple emojis this week.

41:32.700 --> 41:35.860
And everybody was like, oh, is No Man's Sky coming out on Mac?

41:36.060 --> 41:37.820
And sure enough, that was it.

41:37.820 --> 41:39.940
No Man's Sky came out on Mac this week.

41:39.940 --> 41:46.660
So this this game that's like seven years old, that continues to come out on these platforms.

41:46.660 --> 41:53.260
But I did I was I and I thought it was legit cool that like it's coming out through Steam, basically.

41:53.260 --> 42:01.260
And if you already bought No Man's Sky on Steam, on PC or wherever else, you just get the Mac one free, quote unquote.

42:01.260 --> 42:03.180
So it's already unlocked for you.

42:03.180 --> 42:04.180
So I thought that was really cool.

42:04.260 --> 42:06.100
So that's pretty good.

42:06.100 --> 42:09.940
I mean, I already have it for Steam, so that'll be nice.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.380
Oh, then, yeah, it's already in your library.

42:12.540 --> 42:13.740
So that's really cool.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.820
I just didn't want to have to keep logging into GeForce for it.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.020
Yeah, this is fine.

42:19.140 --> 42:20.060
Yeah, interesting.

42:20.860 --> 42:29.580
You know, and if rumors about where Apple may be, because the No Man's Sky developer said we have something else to announce really soon.

42:30.260 --> 42:37.060
If rumors about where Apple could be going very, very soon, true not to be true, that could be very interesting.

42:37.060 --> 42:41.300
But we'll we'll wait until those curtains are pulled back.

42:41.300 --> 42:45.740
I have not heard of any rumors, nor have I the desire to comment on them.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.180
Yep. All right.

42:47.660 --> 42:48.700
Yep. All right.

42:48.980 --> 42:52.100
Well, let's move on and talk about something else.

42:52.100 --> 42:56.260
Another game that I really like now, Diablo 4, because obviously I've been playing quite a bit of it.

42:56.740 --> 43:00.820
But some people, unfortunately, have had a lot more trouble playing Diablo 4.

43:01.340 --> 43:09.900
For the most part, the launch of Diablo 4 has actually been like shockingly smooth for a Diablo game or for a Blizzard game.

43:09.900 --> 43:16.340
Excuse me. Like, you know, well, I got to say, actually, some of their more recent WoW expansions have actually launched pretty smoothly as well.

43:16.740 --> 43:24.340
I think Blizzard just has that reputation from 10 years ago of having a lot of hot mess launches and certainly Diablo 3.

43:24.780 --> 43:34.260
Y'all remember the big era when people were trying to play Diablo 3 and everybody was pissed that Diablo 3 was always online, which is funny because that's like the norm now and nobody cares anymore.

43:34.660 --> 43:37.180
But Diablo 3 had all those issues.

43:37.580 --> 43:45.100
Well, for the most part, for most people, Diablo 4 hasn't been an issue, but it has been on the PlayStation 5.

43:45.740 --> 43:51.660
Some folks are having problems getting into Diablo 4 on the PlayStation 5, and this is because of what's called a valid license error.

43:52.020 --> 43:58.180
So apparently what would happen is that if the game just couldn't authenticate or whatever, it would not let you in the game.

43:58.580 --> 44:02.260
People found a workaround of doing one of two things.

44:02.260 --> 44:11.180
The first workaround that was found was, oh, if you buy two dollars worth of the Diablo currency on the PlayStation store, you can get in.

44:11.660 --> 44:13.460
And people were like, oh, that's shitty.

44:13.460 --> 44:21.380
Oh, that's shady. But what the trick really is, is that you're downloading something new from the store and it's causing the store to refresh your account.

44:21.660 --> 44:28.100
So people realized if you download a free game, you can also like go download Fortnite or whatever is free to play.

44:28.100 --> 44:29.460
There's a ton of stuff in the free play section.

44:29.860 --> 44:33.500
Go download something there and it will update your license and then you can get into Diablo 4.

44:33.860 --> 44:40.380
Interestingly enough, this doesn't seem specific to PlayStation because it's also been happening on Xbox.

44:40.660 --> 44:45.780
I know Dark Tetsuya was saying, yeah, I've been having a similar problem on the Xbox series.

44:46.380 --> 44:52.500
So it doesn't seem like it's as prevalent on Microsoft, but it definitely hit PlayStation.

44:53.780 --> 44:55.460
Really interesting thought.

44:56.460 --> 45:09.700
You know, all this stuff lately about Microsoft trying to buy Activision and Blizzard and Sony's response was that, well, they could screw us on launches if they wanted to.

45:11.500 --> 45:22.180
Now, I don't think Blizzard or Activision screwed the launch here because I think if it's a store license issue, that sounds like a Sony problem to me.

45:23.060 --> 45:27.940
But if it's on multiple platforms, though, that is, yeah, that is so I'm not I'm not sure.

45:29.860 --> 45:47.180
I feel like this is going to get diagnosed a little further, because if this is a Sony problem, then whatever Sony has to eat it, if this is a Blizzard problem, this issue is going to come back again in an arbitration room or a courtroom watch.

45:48.060 --> 45:52.340
Because this is exactly what Sony was bitching about coming to life.

45:54.420 --> 45:55.540
For better or for worse.

45:59.100 --> 46:06.780
Yeah, I mean, I could see them someone doing a case, I really that it's not letting you play it for like a day or so, whatever.

46:06.860 --> 46:09.260
I mean, they obviously got it fixed.

46:09.260 --> 46:12.660
It's not like it's not saying, oh, we got to purchase it.

46:13.660 --> 46:18.700
You know, you know, the pay to be in their minute one if they're not in their minute one.

46:18.700 --> 46:24.940
And by the way, they that by the way, the part a lot of people aren't saying they actually opened the servers 10 minutes early.

46:24.940 --> 46:27.140
It was supposed to launch at four o'clock Pacific.

46:27.420 --> 46:36.420
Those sneaky little sneaks actually plugged it in at 350 just for this reason to not everybody slam at the same second.

46:36.980 --> 46:38.820
They opened it early so people could get in.

46:39.460 --> 46:43.340
It's a smart thing to do, but so they can have a little bit more graceful.

46:43.340 --> 46:45.660
But again, on the PC front, you wouldn't know anything is wrong.

46:45.660 --> 46:47.380
It's running smooth as butter on PC.

46:47.860 --> 46:49.860
Like, yeah, I mean, sure.

46:49.860 --> 46:51.380
Like people are going to sue about everything.

46:51.380 --> 46:57.180
I still see like advertisements on Facebook about like steam lawsuits saying that steam is monopolizing PC and like.

46:58.740 --> 47:00.780
Do you not understand how storefronts work?

47:02.140 --> 47:02.700
But like.

47:04.060 --> 47:05.460
Yeah, I don't know.

47:05.460 --> 47:05.980
Yeah, sure.

47:05.980 --> 47:07.140
I guess anything's possible.

47:07.140 --> 47:09.140
People are dumb and will like sue over everything.

47:09.140 --> 47:11.620
But like, I think is it is it warranted?

47:11.620 --> 47:13.740
Probably not in this scenario.

47:13.740 --> 47:15.140
I don't think they sue.

47:15.140 --> 47:16.580
But keep in mind, the U.S.

47:16.580 --> 47:19.220
hasn't made their decision yet on this whole thing.

47:19.340 --> 47:21.260
So that's why I say it's coming up.

47:21.260 --> 47:25.500
Not even like, yeah, that's not even anything like, well, see, you couldn't play it.

47:25.820 --> 47:29.180
But yeah, it's like, but yeah, that's that's on Sony storefront.

47:29.180 --> 47:35.580
Like it was your like if you had these license error issues, like, I don't know, it just sounds like a setup problem.

47:35.580 --> 47:38.860
And it was on both platforms like.

47:38.860 --> 47:42.900
That's just really like drawing straw there, like it's just like it's.

47:43.940 --> 47:48.540
I mean, sure, if that's what like puts them over the edge saying, see, see.

47:49.420 --> 47:51.380
No, I don't think it'll put it over the edge.

47:51.380 --> 47:52.540
I don't think everybody like.

47:52.540 --> 47:55.020
No, I don't think it puts anything of the edge, but I think it gets brought up.

47:55.020 --> 47:55.500
That's all I'm saying.

47:55.500 --> 47:56.460
I think this gets brought up.

47:56.460 --> 47:58.980
I think Sony pulls this out and says, look what happened.

48:00.700 --> 48:02.820
So it'll be interesting.

48:02.820 --> 48:03.260
I don't know.

48:04.260 --> 48:12.260
By the way, and on all that, I heard that, you know, you know, obviously people talk a lot and there's a lot of stuff circulating social media.

48:12.660 --> 48:21.380
Apparently, somebody with Activision Blizzard is supposed to be meeting with somebody with the UK government to try to get them to reverse their decision on the appeal on blocking the merge.

48:21.620 --> 48:25.180
But there is talk on the table that Activision Blizzard may pull out of the UK.

48:26.740 --> 48:31.100
If the Microsoft thing goes through, they may just straight pull out of the UK.

48:32.100 --> 48:42.220
That's an interesting thing for them to leverage, because it's not that the games would suffer because all they have to do is release the games as Microsoft in the UK.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.620
They would close all the offices in the UK.

48:46.340 --> 48:53.460
So I believe now that they could be playing this game is that they're basically saying, if you block us, we'll just pull all your employees out of the UK.

48:53.660 --> 48:55.580
I think they're going to try to strong arm it that way.

48:56.420 --> 48:58.380
That's a pretty.

48:58.380 --> 49:00.580
It's shitty, but it's it's also business.

49:01.500 --> 49:02.100
I get it.

49:02.540 --> 49:04.260
Oh, God. What was that company?

49:04.260 --> 49:04.860
It was.

49:07.940 --> 49:08.900
Not Konami.

49:08.900 --> 49:14.220
Remember, Konami had the the other like publishing arm that they use for the Nintendo because.

49:14.340 --> 49:15.140
No, it's Ultra.

49:15.380 --> 49:15.860
It's Ultra.

49:15.860 --> 49:16.260
Ultra.

49:16.340 --> 49:16.660
Yeah.

49:16.660 --> 49:17.940
Ultra Games is coming back.

49:17.940 --> 49:20.780
Babies publishing Diablo and Call of Duty.

49:22.020 --> 49:26.540
I think I think if the US also blocks it, then they can't do that.

49:26.580 --> 49:32.860
But if the UK kind of sticks out like a thumb where they're the only one that blocked it out of the others, absolutely.

49:32.860 --> 49:41.100
Microsoft, they're going to put that on the table that basically like, OK, well, we're going to just dissolve Activision Blizzard's presence in the UK then.

49:41.460 --> 49:44.420
And they'll I mean, it is shitty, but.

49:45.460 --> 49:46.620
But it's a good tactic.

49:46.620 --> 49:48.740
I mean, yeah, it's a good tactic.

49:48.740 --> 49:50.060
Very good strong arm.

49:50.060 --> 49:56.140
Yeah, but again, the UK has to stand alone in blocking it, which is a whole other issue.

49:56.140 --> 49:59.980
If they're standing alone blocking it, then we kind of look at it going, well, why are they blocking it and everybody else?

50:00.380 --> 50:04.020
Yeah, I mean, it's not the first time the UK's done something to block.

50:06.140 --> 50:06.580
All right.

50:08.100 --> 50:09.220
Anyhow, moving on.

50:09.220 --> 50:14.580
No offense, the people are not their government, but I'm saying the government's been doing some shit.

50:15.700 --> 50:25.420
Believe me, after after the years 2016 to 2021 here in the US, please, please understand the people are not the government.

50:25.900 --> 50:26.660
Oh, indeed.

50:26.660 --> 50:30.260
Indeed, we understand that more than anyone.

50:30.260 --> 50:32.220
We we love all our friends in the UK.

50:32.220 --> 50:36.740
Loudest and worst, you know, the sore thumb sticks out.

50:38.860 --> 50:39.340
All right.

50:39.660 --> 50:42.860
Anyhow, Dark Soccer, Konami got brought up.

50:42.860 --> 50:44.220
So, hey, let's talk about this.

50:45.180 --> 50:47.660
Silent Hill Ascension.

50:48.260 --> 50:52.220
So basically it is going to launch this year.

50:52.220 --> 50:53.620
There is a trailer.

50:54.100 --> 51:10.500
It is coming out with Behavior, Bad Robot Games, DJ2 Entertainment and Genvid all together released the trailer for Silent Hill Ascension.

51:10.500 --> 51:18.820
You know what I kind of hope with Behavior involved in it is that we get some updates for the Silent or we get another Silent Hill pack.

51:19.900 --> 51:21.540
For Dead by Daylight, but going back to...

51:21.540 --> 51:22.300
I would love that.

51:23.020 --> 51:23.380
Yeah.

51:23.860 --> 51:39.660
But anyway, with Silent Hill Ascension, you are going around Silent Hill and there are actions that are going to be going into the game.

51:39.660 --> 51:45.460
Kind of, I guess it almost sounds almost like the quarry, you know, where your actions are going to build the outcome of the game.

51:46.700 --> 51:51.340
But you are going to be playing with a global audience.

51:51.340 --> 51:52.900
I guess it's built for streaming.

51:54.220 --> 52:00.100
But they are basically going to...

52:00.100 --> 52:02.180
Hello, I am trying to see where exactly it is under.

52:02.180 --> 52:03.380
They are talking about the environment a lot.

52:03.940 --> 52:12.060
But they are going to build a completely immersive experience with, you know, live community driven moments.

52:12.060 --> 52:19.460
I am reckoning that something like how Cult of the Lamb works, you know, or having a built in Dixper or something.

52:19.980 --> 52:20.940
Interesting.

52:21.820 --> 52:27.660
But I want to read this quote from Okamoto Motoy, who is the series producer at Konami.

52:28.540 --> 52:31.820
Silent Hill fans and horror audiences everywhere will have a lot to look forward to.

52:31.820 --> 52:42.300
We are pleased to tell a new interactive story and never before explored locations alongside new characters that will be introduced to fans of the Silent Hill universe.

52:43.020 --> 52:50.060
It is you who decide the fate of multiple main characters, which will unfold simultaneously around the globe.

52:51.340 --> 53:01.700
Hmm, it almost sounds like the creative direction of the show could be whatever the Internet votes on, like it might not be like an individualized experience.

53:01.700 --> 53:12.780
I don't know. I can't kind of tell, but I'm getting the sense that like it's actually whatever the entire Internet decides is what happens, which actually sounds really horrific and I hope is not the direction they go in.

53:12.780 --> 53:17.380
That sounds very like how Elon Musk wants to run Twitter.

53:18.100 --> 53:20.460
And I don't know how I feel about that.

53:20.620 --> 53:22.620
But I'm hoping I'm misunderstanding that.

53:23.660 --> 53:28.020
I think it's going to be like a choose your own adventure, you're going to have the presets.

53:28.020 --> 53:29.340
OK, well, that would be much better.

53:30.300 --> 53:38.700
But the thing is, is that this allows for a replay of seasons, if that makes sense.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.500
I mean, it looks pretty interesting.

53:42.500 --> 53:47.220
I would rather play, you know.

53:47.540 --> 54:00.420
Yeah, well, I'm OK with a narrative game, like especially like a tell tale kind of game or, you know, you even brought up Until Dawn or Cory, but I think that, oh, no, that's being done in the Dead by Daylight universe.

54:00.420 --> 54:09.780
So I guess I get all these horror game franchises mixed up sometimes, but it could be interesting to see something go that direction for sure as well.

54:09.780 --> 54:19.140
But yeah, I just I worry if it's something where the entire Internet votes on it because it's it's going to get gross real quick.

54:19.700 --> 54:21.940
What? The Internet is a cesspool?

54:22.180 --> 54:23.300
Yes, that part.

54:24.220 --> 54:27.060
So, yeah, I just I hope they're not going that direction.

54:27.380 --> 54:30.060
But we'll see when the game comes out or we have some more details.

54:30.740 --> 54:35.540
S2100 Matt in chat says, yeah, I worry how that will play out.

54:35.540 --> 54:38.180
Yeah, I'm going to try to be helpful.

54:38.260 --> 54:46.860
Yeah, I want to try to be helpful, too, and I'll wait I'll wait to see some gameplay, some details to really kind of formulate those thoughts, but it does feel a little nebulous right now.

54:47.660 --> 54:48.860
Oh, of course.

54:48.860 --> 55:04.580
But I'm still I'm I'm maintaining a little bit of hope that maybe it's enough that people will be fans of the series and want to that the good will outweigh the bad.

55:04.620 --> 55:08.780
Yeah, and on the bright side, it's not the only Silent Hill thing that's coming out either.

55:08.780 --> 55:15.300
So if this doesn't end up being your cup of tea, you still have the Silent Hill 2 remake, you still have the Silent Hill F or whatever that was called, they showed the trailer for.

55:15.540 --> 55:19.260
So it's still all these other places they're building out the universe.

55:19.260 --> 55:22.420
So if this doesn't end up being your cup of tea, there's probably something that will be.

55:23.980 --> 55:27.020
Except Pachinko, for some reason, they're done with the Pachinko.

55:27.020 --> 55:28.100
I don't know what that's all about.

55:28.420 --> 55:31.420
Maybe no one's into the Apache slot that much anymore.

55:31.660 --> 55:32.300
I guess.

55:33.180 --> 55:33.660
All right.

55:33.660 --> 55:36.580
Well, speaking of something else, people don't seem to be into anymore.

55:36.860 --> 55:40.100
Loki, let's talk about a recently released game.

55:40.500 --> 55:49.700
Yeah, I don't know if anybody was into it much when it came out, but there were a couple of people in chat here that were like, it's not as bad as everyone says is it sounds like could have been better.

55:49.700 --> 55:55.500
It sounds like it's one of those things where it's like once you get back, is that like Harambee in the background on your stream?

55:55.500 --> 55:56.620
What the hell was that?

55:57.340 --> 55:58.980
This is one to switch.

55:59.380 --> 56:04.580
This is what you deserve is a stupid monkey doing garbage.

56:05.780 --> 56:07.420
I don't even know half these games.

56:07.420 --> 56:08.780
I've played one to switch.

56:08.780 --> 56:10.740
I didn't even know about half of these games.

56:10.740 --> 56:11.220
It's in.

56:11.220 --> 56:15.540
I remind you they have a game that I even when I saw it, I was like, what?

56:15.540 --> 56:24.340
Like where they had you rock your controller to you had to rock the controller because the controller was a baby and you had to put it to sleep.

56:25.260 --> 56:28.500
And my mind's like, someone's going to shake that damn controller.

56:29.540 --> 56:34.540
So that would be wasn't there like a cookie mama spinoff game that was that.

56:34.540 --> 56:39.060
And if you shook the controller, it was a big like, no, like that came up like X or something.

56:39.060 --> 56:40.220
I swear that was the thing.

56:40.580 --> 56:42.340
And that was one where they had it.

56:42.380 --> 56:45.980
It was like a baby doll that you actually insert the controller into.

56:45.980 --> 56:51.020
Like you put the Wii in its mouth or the Wiimote thing in the mouth or something terrible.

56:51.020 --> 56:53.220
You do something horrible to that doll.

56:53.220 --> 56:55.820
And yes.

56:56.540 --> 56:58.340
Because that poor child did die.

57:00.940 --> 57:01.340
All right.

57:02.140 --> 57:05.460
Anyways, yeah, game's stupid or just, you know.

57:07.020 --> 57:10.620
But anyway, it didn't have the bugs that Redful had.

57:10.780 --> 57:13.660
So, you know, that is an unfortunate thing.

57:13.660 --> 57:14.580
So what happened?

57:14.580 --> 57:15.780
What happened with Redful?

57:15.780 --> 57:17.420
Why was it the way it was?

57:17.420 --> 57:25.420
Well, some reasons may have come out from this article by Bloomberg basically saying that, look, Microsoft didn't really have

57:25.420 --> 57:29.660
hands on on the game development with this game.

57:30.020 --> 57:36.500
They kind of left it to Bethesda to take care of, aside from making the decision not to publish it on the PlayStation 5.

57:37.180 --> 57:46.260
With that, though, the Austin studio that was handling Redfall, apparently, you know, a good portion of the team, 70% of the

57:46.260 --> 57:54.060
team that had made Prey, which was markedly a better game, had left Arkane Austin by the time Redfall had shipped.

57:54.340 --> 57:59.220
So losing a lot of that talent could have definitely been part of the problem there as well.

58:00.940 --> 58:07.700
Also, there was an interview with Kind of Funny Games where Spencer defended the creative direction of the game, saying one

58:07.700 --> 58:11.580
thing I will fight is this sort of what went wrong.

58:11.580 --> 58:15.060
There's clearly quality and execution things we can do.

58:15.300 --> 58:19.700
But one thing I won't do is push against the creative aspirations of our team.

58:20.700 --> 58:25.300
OK, I don't think it was like harping on the creativity of the game.

58:25.300 --> 58:27.300
They were just saying the game runs like dog shit.

58:27.300 --> 58:29.020
So, you know, maybe don't do that.

58:30.540 --> 58:34.660
Yes, I understand the problem with the game is not like the story or creative stuff.

58:34.660 --> 58:38.700
It's it's well, that's not I mean, yes and no.

58:38.700 --> 58:48.580
Like, I will hark on the I will make a complaint about the creativity of the game, because, like, for example, you have

58:48.980 --> 58:54.580
Dishonored, which has like really awesome, like real time cut scenes and stuff like that.

58:54.580 --> 58:59.780
That's like a really, you know, a solid narrative to the game.

58:59.780 --> 59:02.900
Same with even Deathloop and stuff like that.

59:03.780 --> 59:09.620
This one has like static images that they pan slowly across the screen.

59:11.180 --> 59:17.060
And that's it, like there's like no like cut scenes in there, it's like they like half-assed it.

59:17.580 --> 59:26.580
Which I'm sorry, but like that, when you have one game that looks really cool, like you've put out games that are really high quality and then this one comes out.

59:26.580 --> 59:30.820
It's just even that much more of a contrast to your previous games.

59:30.820 --> 59:39.860
And so obviously it's people are going to complain about it because it's they were expecting Dishonored and you gave them one to switch.

59:39.860 --> 59:51.900
All right, well, let's move on and address another rumor that's going around in the gaming community right now.

59:51.900 --> 59:59.540
And that is that CD Projekt Red is apparently trying to get or is Sony is trying to buy CD Projekt Red.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:13.100
And the rumor is so loud that President and CEO Adam Kinski actually said in a recent investor Q&A, not happening, CD Projekt is not for sale.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:26.060
This dates back to apparently a Destiny leaker who had one that had been right before, had a thread on Reddit that PlayStation wants to buy CD Projekt Red in that investor Q&A.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:28.620
The CEO said nothing has changed on our end.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:32.220
I can repeat what we've been saying throughout the year, CD Projekt is not for sale.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.780
We want to remain independent.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.380
We have, I believe, an excellent strategy for sure.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.300
It's not easy to execute, but it's very exciting to follow our path.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.820
So it's pure rumor.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:47.060
So we already know that they're working on some other things that have nothing to do with Cyberpunk 2077.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.420
For example, a new Witcher trilogy is something that's being worked on.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.860
There's also the expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, which will be shown at Cyber Game Fest.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.140
That is something they're going to show.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.180
So there's still more to come there.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:12.420
But interesting that we always get these rumors about Sony trying to buy somebody like, like they've got to be looking around wondering who can we buy since Microsoft's getting Activision Blizzard?

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.180
Who can we buy?

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.220
I don't know.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.300
Maybe they'll buy Capcom.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:16.900
I don't know.

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:21.420
Just because, yeah, just because, you know, it still could be a true rumor.

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:30.060
It could be that, you know, internally, they're like, yeah, we're interested in acquiring this company, but if the company doesn't want to sell, they can't purchase it.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:30.460
Right.

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.700
You know, that's still so both could be true at the same time.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:34.700
True.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.660
Hi, Dr. Sakurai.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:42.020
Well, it's finally happened.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.060
I can't make words.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:53.380
It's Chiyo Kazuhiro, who is the current producer of the Mega Man series, has left Capcom.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:59.820
He followed Inahune in 2010 as taking over.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:09.620
The first one he worked on was Mega Man 7 for Super Nintendo and recently worked on Mega Man Legacy Collection and the Battle Network series.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.900
But there is no announced replacement for him yet.

01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:18.580
I wonder if this means they aren't working on a new Mega Man game right now.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.460
You think they would be.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:23.060
I thought the more recent entries actually sold pretty decently, but.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.260
Yeah, I liked 11.

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.020
Yeah.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.260
So that's unfortunate.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:34.900
And they also they've been re-releasing like a bunch of those collections that probably sold pretty well.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.460
So, yeah, Battle Network, all that just came out recently.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:48.980
And and I would like to say that, like, I mean, I get it that they're not making stuff, but like watching the the showcase and like runs of Mega Man Maker games.

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.380
Pretty awesome.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:52.140
During the summer games done quick.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.820
Oh, I didn't see the Mega Man.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:57.300
I saw some of the Mario Maker relay that they were doing.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:03.340
But yeah, so like there's like a PC game that's Mega Man Maker that somebody's that they've developed and stuff.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:05.420
And so you can make your own custom Mega Man games.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:11.540
And they did a bunch of Mega Man levels themed after other, you know, eight big games, which I thought was funny.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:12.980
Yeah, that's cool.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.380
Yeah, all right.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:16.660
Moving on, Loki.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:23.460
All right, so there's this whole thing going on with esports now.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:40.700
Basically, some of the leagues are trying to unionize and are striking over plans to make rule changes that would, I guess, cut the North American Challenger League from 16 teams to seven.

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.060
I thought at least I thought that they were trying to.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:48.700
Yeah, the else the LCS Players Association representing the region's professional players.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:53.660
So the estimated 70 players, coaches, et cetera, lose their jobs.

01:03:54.220 --> 01:04:02.020
And Riot says that the cuts were necessary to ensure that the North American leagues remain sustainable and economically viable.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.660
So they're just going to try to refuse to play.

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:12.860
And then Riot's basically going to say, well, if you strike, then we're going to cancel the entire esports season.

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.740
I guess that makes sense if you don't play teams.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.020
Yeah.

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:30.300
So they're saying, hopefully, this two week window will give us time to for productive dialogue between the LSCPA teams and the league and then resume LCS competition this summer.

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:40.340
The LCS will not be penalizing teams for not fielding their rosters during this two week period to allow for everyone's space to focus on constructive dialogue.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:50.660
We're doing our best to ensure LCS employees, contractors, and others supporting LCS or others supporting the LCS are not negatively impacted by the delay.

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.100
So.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:54.500
Yep.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:05:03.620
And there was another thing, too, saying that there's Riot, they said that there's a possibility of teams using scab players.

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.340
Yeah, so hopefully, hopefully they don't do that.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:08.220
Hmm.

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.060
I'm just like people.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:18.140
Yeah, a lot of a lot of strong arm tactics going on in the industry right now in there.

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:19.540
Yeah.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:20.980
All right.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:25.420
Well, what a terrible what a terrible follow up this makes for it.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:30.820
But it's one of those things where it's like the lion, the witch and the audacity of this bitch.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:40.100
Like, again, here we are talking about, you know who, the CEO of Activision Blizzard, Bobby Beeptic.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.540
Bobby Crap?

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.580
I don't know why, but he got a fucking cover story on variety this week.

01:05:46.820 --> 01:05:51.620
And I'm assuming it's because of Diablo four's launch or whatever, which variety is a Hollywood thing.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:54.220
But we know games are starting to bleed the line with Hollywood.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.020
So fine, whatever.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.580
I get why variety is doing that.

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.780
But to give this guy the cover, Christ.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:11.700
But there's this whole interview that they just basically give him a platform to say things like, quote, we've had every possible form of investigation done and we did not have a systemic issue with harassment ever.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:16.180
Well, fucking Jason laid it out in the intro already.

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:20.500
Like the lie detector test determined that was a lie.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.140
Like, lie detectors don't work.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.060
It's a Maury reference.

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:34.340
But it's just, yeah, obviously, you know, Diablo four is launching and all that stuff.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:49.780
And oh, he's variety says in that interview, quote, continue to comment from, you know, who is saying, look, like any large company with 16000 employees, we're going to have some instances of workplace discrimination or harassment.

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:55.820
We're fortunate over our 30 years has been a very small number and it's something that we care deeply about.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.940
I swear to God, that sounds like something our last president would have said.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:09.580
That sounds like a quote from what the last like the the way that's phrased is just from the school of I'm not even going to say his name, but you all know who I'm talking about.

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.100
It's a very small number.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:12.820
We care.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:16.340
That is no, we don't care at all.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.020
He needs to go.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.180
He needs to go.

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:26.020
I mean, yeah, this is a perfect example of why he needs to go, because he doesn't think there's a problem.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.700
I mean, he's come on.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.860
I mean, there's no problem.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:34.700
I mean, obviously, they're not going to come out and say, yeah, we knew about this systemic problem at our company.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:35.940
Of course, he's going to deny it.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:36.860
Of course he is.

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:37.620
Here's the thing.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.660
He's only emboldened by everything that's happened.

01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:44.260
Recap the board of directors at Activision.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:53.020
So the own company that talks to this guy every day did that report that cleared Bobby Kotick of any wrongdoing.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:09.860
And in that report, it said, contrary to many of the allegations, the board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that Activision Blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported, which we all know again lie.

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:13.300
And Bobby Kotick said now he's just emboldened.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:22.980
He says in the cover story of Variety, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you if any of what you read in the inflammatory narrative was truthful.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.580
He shouldn't be sitting there.

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:35.860
That's why all of us that care about this industry are so fucking mad, because it's this systemic fuckery going on with the board of directors.

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:37.500
I got to watch getting loud tonight.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.420
My voice can't handle it.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.540
Breathe in, breathe out.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:47.380
OK, it's this systemic fuckery happening with the board of directors that is allowing Bobby Kotick to stay in place.

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:50.860
And the whole process is infuriating.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:09:00.540
And the fact that now this is just a cover story that more people can read as almost like this guy is trying to save face is also.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:08.700
Infuriating, and I just want to see this guy out of our industry sooner rather than later.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:10.660
Period.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:14.820
I agree.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:17.700
And I don't know what else needs to be said.

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:25.380
So let's travel back to a simpler time when this guy wasn't in the headlines.

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:32.020
Let's go back in this next segment to a more fun time in gaming, if I can find the button.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.900
I'm a little flustered by it.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:49.740
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:52.860
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:57.340
All right, what did you pick for the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:04.140
Saturn Bomberman, which is a very specific reason I chose Saturn Bomberman.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:09.300
I love Bomberman, don't get me wrong, but this one is a little bit special.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:16.260
So of course, it was an action game developed by Hudson Soft for Sega Saturn.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:28.580
It is the 12th Bomberman game, and it was released in Japan on July 19th, 1996, and in North America on August 22nd, 1997, and in Europe in 1997 as well.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.900
It is a multiplayer game for up to 10 players.

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:45.580
It is one of the top, I would say, rated Bomberman games, although it did get some criticism for not really pushing the series.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.500
But at any rate, it has that battle mode and a story mode.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:59.100
And then there's a master mode where you have to finish a series of levels where you're given rank based on how much time is taken.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:05.140
And so you have a scoreboard for how fast you do and you get different power ups.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.460
Of course, there's new ones.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:11.100
Saturn Bomberman brings in dinosaur helpers, which are found as eggs.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:21.820
And when you release, they're released when you destroy a soft block and there are babies, adolescents and adults in the appropriate strength level.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:29.180
They can take one hit and you can ride the dinosaur and basically they act as your Yoshi.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.900
They get hit, you're OK.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.380
You have different power ups.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:43.700
The special meter that slowly builds up and once the meter is full, your dinosaur will grow a level from baby to adolescent and adolescent to adult.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:46.020
But in battle mode, it's a little differently.

01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.500
When you collect an egg riding the dinosaur, the dinosaur will grow.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.620
And then you can jump off the dinosaur at any time.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:12:06.340
So basically, the story mode for this is that you blow up poles with red orbs that are called Zarfs while destroying your enemies and blowing up blocks and getting power ups.

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:13.140
And then once you clean up all the Zarfs, you get an exit and can go and you do a victory pose and there's a cut scene.

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.780
The battle mode.

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:20.380
So this is where it gets interesting.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:24.500
So you need two multitaps for this.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:36.940
Seven players can connect on one multitap or you can just play two, but you also can go against bots in the game.

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:47.700
If you have more than eight players, you get a widescreen arena that shrinks the characters down.

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:54.860
It's a little bit, it makes the play field area very large, but it disables some power ups, including the dinosaurs.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:13:02.740
The North American version also supports the Sega Netlink for up to four players online.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.380
They were pretty split over this.

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:19.460
Like I said, you know, a lot of people thought that this was an amazing addition, that the power ups in the system was just pretty, pretty awesome.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:26.820
You know, having the 10 players set up was also pretty great, but there were some people who thought it just didn't do enough.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:35.660
They think that it's still too much classic Bomberman and didn't add anything fresh to it.

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:50.540
That's really been the only thing, but not everyone was fully sold on the 10 player feature as well because of the screen size and losing the power ups and whatnot.

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:56.460
AGM said it was a mediocre one player game, but a fantastic multiplayer game.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:03.900
And honestly, I've only ever played this multiplayer, so I think the biggest party I played with was a six person party.

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:18.780
They also said the graphics and music weren't super great, but this one itself, you know, like I said, this one, this one was just a really fun group game.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.780
I mean, in the end, that's what it was meant for.

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:29.100
It was ranked as the second best Saturn game of 1997 with Fighters Megamix being right above it.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.580
I don't know if I've done Fighters Megamix, I might need to.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:36.980
In 2014, Retro Gamer placed this on their top 10 Saturn games list.

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:46.620
And I think that, yeah, it's a little divisive, but I think it's a fun game if you just look at it for what it is.

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:51.820
It's a Bomberman game and it's on the Saturn and you can have a lot of friends play with you.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.700
This is an ultimate party game.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.980
So there you go.

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:01.940
All right, your classic game of the week, Saturn Bomberman.

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:03.900
I was actually pretty surprised I've never done a Bomberman.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.300
Oh, you haven't done any, but I thought you've done at least one of them.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:10.620
Wow.

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.460
I looked and no Bombers came up.

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.700
Interesting.

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:20.340
I think I've done, I think I've done Star Parodia and I think that's the closest to Bomberman I got.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:21.420
Interesting.

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:22.620
All right.

01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:29.700
Well, I never played the Saturn one, but that party mode sounds really messy.

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:30.460
It's pretty epic.

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:32.260
It is messy though.

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:38.580
I mean, like when you get to the 10 player one, I'll be honest, it never really appealed to me in that respect.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:46.700
But at the same time, I mean, it's, it's just, you know, it's Bomberman.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.460
How can you go wrong with Bomberman?

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:49.540
All right.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:56.780
Well, let's travel around and get some rapid fire news and some other topics really quickly here before we wrap up.

01:15:56.780 --> 01:15:59.060
Yeah, we're going to move to wrap up here pretty soon, actually, folks.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:05.100
Sorry, I know it's a little early, but as I said, just for a multitude of issues, we want to keep it a little shorter than usual tonight.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.100
So sorry, but I'm sure you all understand.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:10.380
So let's do some other quick headlines.

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:10.820
Loki.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:16.140
Yeah, so itch.io is doing yet another queer games bundle.

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:30.780
I think we did something similar like this last year, but we have another bundle with 450 games, tabletop games, books, zines, albums, art, and from nearly 300 queer creators, all for 60 bucks.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:37.900
The price of one AAA game, you can get 450 pieces of games and all sorts of other things.

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:39.660
So that's pretty cool.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:48.060
And I have no idea what's in that in that bundle, but it's probably a lot of stuff.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:53.620
I have way too much stuff on itch.io that I've not touched, but I'll still probably buy it.

01:16:54.620 --> 01:17:02.100
And PlayStation Plus has announced their monthly games lineup for June 2023.

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.620
So you're going to be getting with games of the plus NBA 2K23.

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:11.140
And we have Jurassic World Evolution 2.

01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:14.340
Those are both are going to be on PlayStation five and PlayStation four.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:18.420
And last but not least, Trek de Yomi is going to be on both as well.

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:21.020
All right.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:25.340
I think I gave you the same link twice for Xbox Game Pass.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.860
Sorry, we can come back and do those at the end if you want to find the right link in the showroom.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:36.700
Let me go to Dark Sakura first, then when I saw this headline, I instantly thought of you.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:42.300
Yeah, and it's going to be too much for me to do the preorder as much as I want it.

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:53.940
But Cotton 100%, which is a SNES classic or a Super Famicom classic is being re-released for September 2023 date.

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:58.380
It will be roughly 55 bucks.

01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:01.900
It comes with a brand new art reminiscent of the original.

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.900
I'll be more specific about it.

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:08.940
It says delivery date between September 26th and October 5th.

01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:16.060
So around late September, it's 7,678 yen.

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.300
Now the delivery price on this of the release date of September 21st.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:20.820
There you go.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:27.180
Gosh, the delivery on this is 2,416 yen.

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.060
But oh, my gosh, I want it so much.

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.180
I love Cotton.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:35.740
But it's not the only game that they're doing this with.

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:43.340
I think I'm just looking at some of the upcoming stuff available.

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:50.060
No, actually, I think Cotton is the only one that's getting the release like that.

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:58.660
I thought I saw other stuff, but yeah, there's Battletoads.

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:04.700
Looks like Battletoads is a resale version of the scenes of it.

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:10.740
And there's a Mega Drive game on here, too, which is.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:15.580
I don't recognize the game.

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.940
Oh, a Glalancer.

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:22.940
Yeah, so I'm seeing a few things on there for other things,

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:27.780
but they also have a bunch of like retro knockoff systems meant to play things.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:33.820
But but yeah, I mean, Cotton, shit.

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:35.620
I love that game.

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:36.940
All right.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:43.180
Well, we had brought it up earlier in the show, but just to officially recap, Summer

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:53.180
Game Stunt Quick did happen this last week and the official final total $2,239,204 for

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:59.140
Doctors Without Borders, or I believe that's Merica San Fronteras is that's why it's

01:19:59.140 --> 01:19:59.980
MSF USA.

01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.700
It's Doctors Without Borders.

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:06.020
Yeah, but it's Doctors Without Borders.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:10.460
And yeah, they raised quite a bit of money there.

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:13.580
That's certainly no small amount to blink at.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.420
That's a great job by All Done.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:22.220
Some folks are noting it's not as much as was raised last year, but there's probably a

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.900
few things that come into play with that.

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:28.060
Again, Bobby went into this in depth on his show, so I won't recap it too much.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:32.900
But something to kind of consider is that if you look at the timing that this year's

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.980
event happened, it was really different from other years.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:41.340
Usually this happens pretty close to my birthday and OLR's birthday, which is the end

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:41.820
of June.

01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:44.580
We're close to the end of June right now.

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:47.340
So I would say timing is probably a part of that.

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:51.900
But again, I will defer to Bobby's show tonight who gets a little more into it tonight.

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.180
But again, I don't I don't think we should be like, oh, no, it didn't raise as much.

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:58.940
I guess it still raised 2.2 million dollars.

01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.100
When was the last time you raised that kind of money?

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:06.340
That's a great amount of money for a very worthy cause.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:09.460
So congratulations to everyone that was involved with that.

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.980
All right, Loki, do you want to talk about Xbox Game Pass real quick?

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.260
Yeah, so Game Pass is getting quite a few games for the month of June.

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:24.180
So we have Chicory, A Colorful Tale that's both on console and PC, as well as cloud.

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:28.100
Far World Pioneers on console and PC.

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:32.780
We have Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 on all three.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:37.860
Slayer's X, Terminal Aftermath, Vengeance of the Slayer on all three.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.060
The Big Con, that's also all three.

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:42.380
Amnesia, The Bunker.

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:49.220
We've got Hypno Space Outlaw, Rune Factory 4 Special, Stacking.

01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:55.260
Let's see, Dord, I have no idea how to pronounce.

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:57.420
I'm going to butcher this, but that's fine.

01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.660
It looks like Dordogne, I guess.

01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:03.220
That's coming out on all three as well.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.980
And then apparently there's going to be.

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.220
Oh, gosh, there's still more.

01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:12.580
OK, well, we've got Super Mega Baseball 4.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:17.020
That's going to be early access with I guess that's EA Play.

01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:23.900
And then Supress, the Superlands, Six Inches Under Battlefield 2040.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.980
And this is like I think this is DLC game updates.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.580
So Tales and Trails.

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:33.420
Yeah, of course, that's Minecraft stuff leaving games past.

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:37.500
We've got our bridge constructor portal that's going to be leaving.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:42.020
Chorus, Maneater, Mortal Shell, Serious Sam 4 and Total War Three Kingdoms.

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:46.340
There were some updates to that leaving list, by the way, since the time

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:48.580
that that was published, because apparently it's out there now that

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:52.140
on the 15th of the month, some pretty heavy hitters are going to be leaving.

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.020
Among Us is leaving Game Pass, which was a pretty heavy hitter

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:55.540
when that came out.

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:59.420
And Shredder's Revenge, the Ninja Turtles game, is going to be leaving Game Pass.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.500
That would be that's been about a year since that came out, right?

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.420
So maybe the year kind of ran out on that.

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.180
So but that was still a little surprising.

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:10.820
I was like, oh, Game Pass kind of been taking some hits,

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.300
but I think something to really keep in mind.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.300
And again, as we start to get to the end of the show.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:22.580
This weekend, coming weekend, and by the time we're on our next show,

01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:25.060
going to be huge, especially for Microsoft.

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.380
Don't forget, everyone.

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:30.660
Microsoft doing a big event Sunday morningish, afternoonish.

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.420
It's around isn't around like 11 a.m.

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.060
I don't remember the exact time.

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:36.620
Somebody in chat needs to jump in, please.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:39.900
But they're also doing the Starfield Direct as well.

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:43.020
So they're kind of doing the deep dive on Starfield and Microsoft announcements.

01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:45.660
So we'll find out what else Microsoft's doing this holiday.

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.820
And I don't think it's unrealistic to expect.

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:51.420
There will be stealth Game Pass releases that they have not been.

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:55.260
That is common with these Microsoft events is there's at least one game.

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.500
They'll be like, and it's on Game Pass today.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:01.300
So even though it kind of feels like there's not much coming to Game Pass,

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:07.260
I wonder if they haven't been stockpiling them a little bit to dump with this.

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.540
Dark to see also reminding us Summer Game Fest is also Thursday.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.500
So there's going to be a lot that happens with that.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:16.060
There's no way I can simulcast that.

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.820
Anything that happens during the day now, there's no way I can simulcast it.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.860
I guess I didn't mention it.

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:25.460
I'll say I got a I got a promotion at work, which is great.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.260
And, you know, all that.

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:32.180
But it just means more time that I just I have so much to do right now.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.740
So, yeah, I can't pull away for that.

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:37.900
I wish these things were in the evening, but I understand because of time zones,

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:41.060
they want to do a lot of these things because like one o'clock

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.100
L.A. time is like nine o'clock in the UK.

01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:49.300
So I understand why they want to do things when they do.

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:53.100
But yeah, it just sucks during the day I can't simulcast.

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:56.020
But I'll definitely be checking out the footnotes after the fact,

01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.300
because I'm really curious to see what they do announce from the event for sure.

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.100
So. All right.

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:04.260
Yeah. Next week's show, we're going to have a lot more stories

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:07.220
and hopefully I won't be feeling like shit. All right.

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:12.100
Let's do some release dates of what's coming out this week.

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.820
Loki in the US, what's coming out this week?

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.940
This week, we have Amnesia, the bunker

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:24.180
that's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:28.540
Diablo four is finally coming out for everybody else that didn't preorder.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:33.300
That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:36.780
Loop eight, Summer of the Gods.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:41.580
That's on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:45.580
Raiden three cross

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:50.500
Mikado Maniacs, and that's on PC,

01:25:51.060 --> 01:25:55.700
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.500
We have finally a US one.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.820
It is interesting.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.700
The Mikado soundtracks are pretty cool.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:07.780
We have a Bleak Sword DX on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:12.420
Harmony, The Fall of Reverie on PC and Nintendo Switch.

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:15.980
Pro Cycling Manager on 2023.

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:20.580
That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:26.620
And to go along with that, of course, Tour de France 2023 on PC,

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:30.780
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:32.500
And that is it.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.740
All right, let's go over to Japan.

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.100
Japan actually a little slower on releases this week.

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:42.780
The only release on the Nintendo Switch this week is the Telenet shooting collection.

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:48.580
That's a collection of four games, classic titles from PC Engine and Genesis era.

01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:50.380
These seem like dark soccer games.

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:55.340
Granada, Avenger, Gyruss, and Psychic Storm are in this collection.

01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:59.020
Psychic Storm. OK, we have stories about Psychic Storm.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:03.340
I'm sure you have been around where Dan and I have gone, I get pissed off like that.

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:08.780
That is a direct reference to them saying Psychic Storm in Psychic Storm

01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:10.380
because it sounds like I get pissed off.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.020
I see. OK.

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.980
And it's like, Psychic Storm, but it's I get pissed off for us.

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:19.500
Got it. Yeah. Anyway, one game.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.460
And then the only release for the PlayStation five in Japan this week.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:23.380
Actually, there are two.

01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:27.500
MotoGP23 is out this week in Japan on Japan.

01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.700
On June the 8th.

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:34.140
But just like the rest of the world, Japan is also getting Diablo four on June the 6th.

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:37.260
So if you were wondering, is that game coming out of Japan?

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:38.900
Yes, it is. It is still coming out there.

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:40.300
It's a worldwide release, really.

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:46.860
So because not everything Blizzard does goes to Japan because infamously World Warcraft is not available in Japan for whatever reason.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:52.620
So not the people there aren't playing it, but it's not officially released in Japan.

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.620
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:02.500
So in the UK, on the 6th for Xbox and PlayStation, we have Diablo four for Switch.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:07.140
We have Loop eight Summer of Gods on the 8th for the three.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:11.260
We have MotoGP23 on the 9th for Switch.

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:14.460
We have Toy Soldiers for PlayStation and Switch.

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:17.540
We have Garden Simulator for PlayStation and Xbox.

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:23.460
We have Miasma Chronicles on PlayStation, Death or Treat.

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:24.780
Love the name.

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:29.220
Also for PlayStation, Seeker My Shadow.

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:31.540
That's Eastall.

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:32.660
All right.

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:36.700
Well, with that, folks, we have reached the end of the show.

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:42.380
I know it's it was a little shorter tonight, but I think I've laid out why it's still an hour and a half is actually pretty good.

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.020
So thank you all for being here.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:45.940
I appreciate it.

01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:50.820
Let me quickly go to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories you want to cover tonight.

01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.780
Loki, hey, do you have any last minute stories?

01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.460
You all right over there?

01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:01.900
Yeah, I'm OK.

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:03.820
I was looking for last minute stories.

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:06.220
And no, we have no last minute stories.

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:08.940
I was going to say, I didn't seem like a lot a lot happened this week.

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:13.660
But again, you know, with E3 week would have been this upcoming week.

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:17.700
I think a lot of it was probably being saved for this next week.

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.660
So I fully expect next week's going to be a pretty big show with that.

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:26.060
I guess there's one thing I guess I guess you mentioned this really minor.

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:38.460
But apparently the developers that were going to be doing the Knights of the Old Republic to restoration DLC on Switch said that they're not going to be able to do that.

01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.860
Oh, I'm glad you brought this up.

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.540
This is a big deal for that community.

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:42.420
Yeah.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:50.140
So instead, Aspire is going to be offering some free replacement games instead.

01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:59.900
So if you are affected by this, if you preorder this, you can get whether they have Coder 2, the Sith Lords on Steam.

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:09.340
They've got Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic on Switch, The Force Unleashed, Republic Commando, Episode One, Episode One Racer, Jedi Knight,

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:14.580
Jedi Academy or Jedi Knight 2, Jedi Outcast on Switch as well.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.420
So, yeah, that that sucks.

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:20.380
Which if you're a Star Wars fan, you probably already owned all those Switch games.

01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:21.100
So, right.

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:22.980
I mean, it's not like this is a brand new game.

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:24.740
It's just, you know, yeah, yeah.

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:26.700
All right.

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:30.500
Well, let's and I should shout out the mailbag.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.820
I don't think we had any new emails tonight anyway, but I will.

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:33.620
We had garbage.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:38.780
Yeah, I will mention participate at orangesontrader.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:41.060
Again, that's participate at orangesontrader.com.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:43.420
I imagine we might get a couple after Summer Game Fest this week.

01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:43.900
We'll see.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:51.940
I have put out a call, by the way, for at least two cat pictures with nerdy stuff in them.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.020
No, no people.

01:30:53.300 --> 01:31:00.660
I want like video game memorabilia or the old Miitomo thing, you know, stuff like that.

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.740
Oh, yeah, because you're talking about updating the intro, huh?

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:04.700
Right.

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.540
And I need cheddar.

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.180
I was gonna say I need to get you cheddar picks then.

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:21.300
That actually is timed really well because our 21st anniversary, dot, dot, dot, is in three weeks on the 25th would be our 21st anniversary show.

01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:24.060
This show is now old enough to drink.

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:26.260
So there's that.

01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.460
Don't we have other stuff we could be doing?

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.780
Well, putting together cat pictures into a collage.

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:31.860
Clearly, that's one of them.

01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:34.740
So okay, I mean, I was talking about like napping.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.580
Def says, what's the due date for that?

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:39.940
If we want to make that happen by the June 25th show, then what's the due date for that?

01:31:42.820 --> 01:31:43.620
Two weeks.

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:44.380
Two weeks.

01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:48.500
As today, SSJ 100 Matt would like to submit a dog.

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.860
I guess put cat ears on it'll be fine.

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.060
I think we can allow Matt's dog.

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:56.540
He's cute.

01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:57.540
Yeah.

01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:57.980
All right.

01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.060
Just this once.

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:01.500
Dog exceptions on a case by case basis.

01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.580
Ferrets are 1000% allowed.

01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:09.980
Actually, for Def, we should allow other animals too, if he wants.

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.780
Yeah, we can have other animals.

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:13.300
Absolutely.

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:18.020
I'm gonna have to change this to O.L.R.

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.180
Cats and friends.

01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:22.100
Yeah, cats and friends, because we all know cats are in charge.

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:23.020
Absolutely.

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:24.620
The cats rule the stoop.

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:25.620
All right.

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.900
With that, we're gonna wrap up the show for tonight.

01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.100
So that's it.

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.500
Thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.660
If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show.

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.220
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:38.900
But we need more voices to put out on air.

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:43.780
So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you heard the show.

01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:45.140
Those go an awful long way.

01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:46.340
So please consider that.

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:49.660
In the meantime, we'll get everybody's final thoughts.

01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:55.380
So Dark Sakura, I guess you get to get an early start tonight if you want on your post show shenanigans.

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:59.900
Well, that means that, well, actually, I'm going to have a Shayla with me.

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:04.940
I do not know about a Fixie, because I think Fixie is with their significant other.

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:13.100
But yeah, I'm going to do some entertainment and ending things and stuff.

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:14.540
All right.

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:16.340
Well, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:19.500
I don't have any thoughts.

01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:24.980
Oh, I guess I'll just go ahead and say, you know, again, we miss you, Peppers.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:27.940
I'm glad you're not hurting and may your memory be a blessing.

01:33:28.820 --> 01:33:29.220
All right.

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:30.300
Well, thanks, Jamie.

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.380
We'll talk to you next week.

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:33.100
I guess.

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:33.740
All right.

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:35.540
Bye.

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:36.180
All right.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.620
Loki, your final thought tonight?

01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:45.820
Just going to be working hard on more Minecraft content, just rushing to get stuff down or stuff done, I guess.

01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:48.180
Lots of work on, lots to do.

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:49.260
All right.

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:54.260
And my final thought is I really hope I'm feeling better tomorrow because I do want to get to streaming some Diablo 4.

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:58.460
I'm actually a little bit pained that I haven't been able to stream the early hours of the game.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.020
But it is what it is.

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:03.260
Even doing this tonight, I'm already like, oh, it's pressure.

01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:07.380
So I'm going to go treat myself to a nap.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:10.020
So on that thought, we have a busy week ahead.

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:12.900
I think we all need a nap because it's going to be a big week in gaming this week.

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:18.700
So we will be here in seven days to digest all the news from Summer Game Fest, Microsoft's press event.

01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:23.340
I keep saying press event, but it's really, you know, gamer direct conference or whatever you want to call it.

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:28.060
And whatever other surprises might be dropped on us this week, I assume there it may not end there.

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.300
We may have some other surprises this week.

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:32.020
So we'll talk about all of that next week on the show.

01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.180
In the meantime, I hope you all have a wonderful week.

01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:35.660
Thank you so much for being here.

01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:43.820
And I am now going to roll the credits, which, by the way, DJ Rama S subbed the credits out and made good on her promise from last week.

01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:49.180
So that being said, those on the podcast are going to hear something different behind as we outro tonight.

01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:49.820
Good night, everybody.
