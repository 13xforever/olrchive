00:00.000 --> 00:11.600
It's still a weird era.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.000
Business people get advice from business people about what supposedly made them successful,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.440
forgetting how much of it wasn't in their hands to begin with and never will be.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.040
Twitch thinks their TV network can control all their content, so their rules about advertising

00:22.040 --> 00:24.440
went over about as well as could be expected.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.520
Time flows like a river, and history repeats.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.200
Please support the people that do the work.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.160
This is the One Step Forward, Five Leaps Back intro.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.600
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:33.600 --> 00:36.520
this and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now in the show where every

00:36.520 --> 00:38.520
gamer has a voice.

00:38.520 --> 00:44.140
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:44.140 --> 00:46.920
where every gamer has a voice.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.160
It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:49.160 --> 00:56.920
We are live once again, episode number 963 of our show for tonight, June 11th, 2023.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.600
It's a little bit of a busy week in gaming.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.160
We got a lot to get into, but first, let's introduce ourselves and get off topic.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.480
My name is Rob Roberts.

01:05.480 --> 01:09.860
I'm here with you every week, joined by my co-hosts, the one and only Dark Sakura or

01:09.860 --> 01:10.860
Jamie Summers.

01:10.860 --> 01:11.860
I'm mad at popcorn.

01:11.860 --> 01:14.860
I need to go get some more.

01:14.860 --> 01:15.860
That is a shame.

01:15.860 --> 01:23.900
You might need some popcorn tonight with all the cutscenes, cinematics, epics, games coming.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.360
It's delicious kettle corn.

01:25.960 --> 01:26.960
The best.

01:26.960 --> 01:27.960
My favorite.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.960
The best.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.160
After my day, I need it.

01:31.160 --> 01:35.080
Let me cycle back to that real quick, but first, let me say hello as well to Tech Master

01:35.080 --> 01:36.080
Loki.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.080
Hello.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.080
Hi, Loki.

01:38.080 --> 01:39.080
How are you?

01:39.080 --> 01:40.080
Doing good.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.540
Trying to figure out the game behind you playing, because of course, we do tape live every Sunday

01:43.540 --> 01:47.680
night at 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 o'clock Pacific at the Voice of the Geeks Network, twitch.tv

01:47.680 --> 01:53.680
slash VOG Network, V-O-G Network, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show on Sunday nights.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
You can see video.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
It is a podcast.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.200
We try to be mindful of that and keep it very audio based, but sometimes there's just some

01:59.200 --> 02:02.560
fun little things on the video, and the one is I'm trying to figure out what that game

02:02.560 --> 02:05.880
is playing behind Loki on his little webcam tonight.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.160
It was a Super Nintendo game.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.480
Is it the one with the guy playing the banjo on the cover?

02:12.480 --> 02:13.480
No.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.480
That's-

02:14.480 --> 02:15.480
No.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.480
That's a shooter game.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.480
Equinox or something like that.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.480
No.

02:18.480 --> 02:19.480
Equinox was a Sony game.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.520
Flannix, I think, was a game.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.520
That game.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.520
Yeah.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.520
Yeah.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.520
This is Cybernator.

02:25.360 --> 02:30.600
Oh, because there was an NES version of that, wasn't there, or an earlier version or something?

02:30.600 --> 02:31.600
I thought.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.600
Maybe.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.600
Maybe.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
Maybe.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.600
Maybe.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.600
There's a game that was similar.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.600
Yeah.

02:37.600 --> 02:38.600
Okay.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
I don't remember.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
Well, Dark Tetsuya and chat got it.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.600
Ding, ding, ding.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.600
Maybe Cybernator.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.600
So, there it is.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.600
You got it.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.600
Yes, and Flannix was the game I was trying to think of with the epic-

02:45.600 --> 02:46.600
Hey, Link.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.600
No.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.600
The guy playing the banjo.

02:48.600 --> 02:54.040
It's the banjo game because the box art was this infamous guy playing the banjo that had

02:54.560 --> 02:59.400
literally nothing to do with the game.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.800
I don't know why-

03:00.800 --> 03:04.440
And it intrigued you, and you had to rent it then, and you're like-

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
Yeah.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.640
It really was one of those things where it's like, I have to rent this because I don't

03:09.640 --> 03:11.800
know what the hell this is.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.040
I really don't.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.920
I'm not able to find a very large picture of this box art, but I found a little tiny

03:16.920 --> 03:19.400
one there that I can put on stream.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
That's what it looked like.

03:20.760 --> 03:26.160
It's honestly a game I should cover because it was a completely different game and had

03:26.160 --> 03:29.960
a really good X68000 release.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.960
Mm-hmm.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
Yeah, it's-

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
Of course.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.160
Dark Tetsuya says, I mean, people still talk about it 30 years later, so mission accomplished.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
Clearly.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.160
Clearly mission accomplished.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
All right.

03:40.160 --> 03:44.840
We are going to get into some gaming news, but first, Dark Sakura, I know you were talking

03:44.840 --> 03:51.000
about your day, and I wanted to give you some space to vent if you need it.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.560
Oh, it's not really a vent per se.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.360
I had posted earlier that Midna was having some problems.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.320
She had been twitching on her jaw.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.800
Her lower jaw would just twitch, and she'd be licking the top of her mouth, and she was

04:07.800 --> 04:13.120
drooling excessively, but she didn't have bad breath.

04:13.400 --> 04:23.920
The biggest sign that she would have had stomatitis, I believe it is, which is a more advanced,

04:23.920 --> 04:31.280
terrible form of gingivitis, so she didn't have bad breath or anything, and she was doing

04:31.280 --> 04:37.040
other stuff, but whenever I'd go to wipe her mouth with a towel, she'd hiss really badly.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.040
That was yesterday.

04:38.040 --> 04:43.240
My friend Heather, she was a vet tech.

04:43.240 --> 04:50.080
I sent her videos, but because Midna didn't have the bad breath or anything, we were thinking

04:50.080 --> 04:54.400
that it might be neurological, like she had a seizure or an episode or something, until

04:54.400 --> 05:03.840
I sent her a video of Midna eating and trying to get in my face to take some bonito flakes.

05:03.840 --> 05:10.640
We saw her tooth was at a 45-degree angle.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.560
Her appointment was on Tuesday.

05:12.560 --> 05:17.560
I didn't know if I needed to get her into an emergency vet, so I couldn't find my forceps

05:17.560 --> 05:24.280
either, so I sterilized some pliers, and I was just going to see, is it loose?

05:24.280 --> 05:29.640
I barely touched it, and it came out, so Midna's feeling better.

05:29.640 --> 05:37.880
She started eating almost immediately, little hog, cleaning herself.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.720
She's over on the other chair, just chilling.

05:42.720 --> 05:49.640
For anyone who is like, oh no, no way in this thing, it just came out.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.640
It just came out.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.880
I hardly did it.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.520
It just needed a little push.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.120
Or a pull in this case.

05:57.120 --> 06:00.760
It wiggled once and came out, and Midna didn't act any other way.

06:00.760 --> 06:06.280
In fact, she seemed pretty happy when it was gone.

06:06.280 --> 06:18.720
I do have some Chloracin, which is an antibacterial mouth rinse, although they put orange flavor

06:18.720 --> 06:23.640
in it, which is stupid, because citrus scents and flavors are a deterrent to cats.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.640
They hate them.

06:25.680 --> 06:36.440
Midna's extra pissed off about that, but she's still going to get it used for a few days.

06:36.440 --> 06:44.560
And yeah, she's probably going to be on some antibiotics after I take her to the vet, because

06:44.560 --> 06:47.240
I don't want it to get infected.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.480
I'm just afraid that they might need to see if there's any more debris in there, and that's

06:51.480 --> 06:57.360
the part where I don't know if I'm going to have all the money for that, but on a completely

06:57.360 --> 07:03.520
unrelated topic, I have the world's smallest Birkin bag.

07:03.520 --> 07:09.600
For anyone who doesn't know, it's actually a miniature version of an Hermes Birkin in

07:09.600 --> 07:18.400
a nice cappuccino color, and I got a traction machine, but I think they sent me the wrong

07:18.400 --> 07:28.240
one, and yeah, that's been my IRL week, but mostly it's just been Midna for the last couple

07:28.240 --> 07:32.480
of days, and she was so miserable.

07:32.480 --> 07:37.920
If I had seen it sooner, I could have yanked that tooth out, but at least she's done this

07:37.920 --> 07:38.920
time.

07:38.920 --> 07:39.920
At least it's done now, and she's doing better now.

07:39.920 --> 07:40.920
Yeah.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.920
Yeah.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.920
I'm a cat surgeon.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.920
Just kidding.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.920
I'm not.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.920
All right.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
I'm keeping the tooth.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.920
Cats are important.

07:48.440 --> 07:55.440
I want to say a bit of a personal note before we get into the gaming news, because I just

07:55.440 --> 07:57.640
made an announcement at the end of Bobby's show here.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.880
I want to make sure I repeat it here for the OLR audience, and that is I'm not going to

08:01.880 --> 08:04.280
be making one trip to Atlanta this year.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.320
I'm going to be making two.

08:06.320 --> 08:12.040
I'm very excited to announce I'm going to be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo the weekend

08:12.040 --> 08:17.840
of July 28th through the 30th, and this is at the Marriott Renaissance Waverly where

08:17.840 --> 08:18.840
that's happening.

08:18.840 --> 08:24.520
It's very similar in many ways to the show out here that's California Extreme, but they

08:24.520 --> 08:28.240
have some celebrity guests, and it's been getting bigger and bigger, and it's their

08:28.240 --> 08:33.600
10th anniversary year out there, so I'm very excited to go out and take part in that.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.600
Check that out.

08:34.600 --> 08:38.640
I'm hoping to be involved with some panels and do some fun things out there that weekend

08:38.640 --> 08:39.640
in July.

08:39.640 --> 08:46.760
July 28th through the 30th, the Southern Fried Gaming Expo in Atlanta, and I will also still

08:46.760 --> 08:52.240
this year be at Dragon Con, so I'm taking two trips to Atlanta about five weeks apart,

08:52.240 --> 08:55.880
but the Southern Fried trip is only a long weekend.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.840
I literally get in on a Thursday night, and I go out Monday morning.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.320
It's just a long weekend.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.320
Dragon Con, I'm there for an entire week as usual, because Dragon Con is a very long con,

09:06.320 --> 09:07.320
but yeah.

09:07.320 --> 09:12.160
Man, any excuse you can to beat Bobby's score at pinball, I mean, I swear.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.160
Right?

09:13.160 --> 09:14.160
Well, the nice-

09:14.160 --> 09:15.680
This rivalry's getting out of control.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.520
The nice thing about Southern Fried Gaming Expo is that they have an entire room filled

09:19.520 --> 09:24.000
with pinball games that I can get the high score on, or at least, if nothing else, I

09:24.000 --> 09:26.960
probably won't get the high, high score, because there's a lot of very good players there,

09:26.960 --> 09:31.800
but at least beat Bobby's score on as many of the machines as possible, because he can't

09:31.800 --> 09:38.040
ban me from that arcade as long as I am a registered member of the con, which I will

09:38.040 --> 09:39.040
be.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.640
So yes, I'm looking forward to my stupid beginner's luck.

09:42.640 --> 09:46.040
You know that's all it is, is stupid beginner's luck, because I think I talked about it last

09:46.040 --> 09:51.440
week, or a couple weeks ago on the show, when I was in San Diego for work, one of the nights

09:51.440 --> 09:56.200
I went to a coin-op place there that had some pinball games, and I played that Avengers

09:56.200 --> 10:02.440
table for the first time, and I won a free game twice.

10:02.440 --> 10:07.360
That's how ridiculous my beginner's luck was on that table, so there is that, but that's

10:07.360 --> 10:12.840
why I love the Stern connected thing, because when nobody believes me that I did that, I

10:12.840 --> 10:16.560
can be like, see, I have the score and the achievements to prove it, my little Stern

10:16.560 --> 10:19.600
insider thing, so that's something they're doing very well.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.860
All right.

10:21.860 --> 10:28.300
Let's get into a lot of gaming news from this week, because this would have been E3 week,

10:28.300 --> 10:33.820
this coming week would have been E3 week, but obviously not happening, but what did

10:33.820 --> 10:39.540
happen, Summer Game Fest this last week, and then of course this morning, Xbox had a showcase.

10:39.540 --> 10:43.300
So let's start, and then there's actually other things been going on as well, but we're

10:43.300 --> 10:47.660
going to start tonight talking about Summer Game Fest, which happened a few days ago.

10:47.660 --> 10:50.380
Unfortunately, I was not able to watch this live.

10:50.380 --> 10:55.700
I had to get kind of a recap of this, but I kind of caught up on all the news and what

10:55.700 --> 10:56.700
happened.

10:56.700 --> 11:00.860
So first, let's talk about the Prince of Persia, Lost Crown.

11:00.860 --> 11:05.700
So this is a game that's kind of like a 2.5D adventure, it looks a little more like a classic

11:05.700 --> 11:08.460
Prince of Persia title than one of the newer titles.

11:08.460 --> 11:13.680
This is going to be coming out in January, January 18th, 2024, assuming it doesn't get

11:13.680 --> 11:15.460
delayed or anything.

11:15.460 --> 11:18.540
But this honestly, right off the bat, this is probably one of the more exciting titles

11:18.540 --> 11:20.040
out of the whole showcase for me.

11:20.040 --> 11:25.060
So I'm definitely down with Prince of Persia, The Lost Crown, and sort of finding the roots

11:25.060 --> 11:28.580
a little bit of the series.

11:28.580 --> 11:32.980
Another, we went right from that into Mortal Kombat 1.

11:32.980 --> 11:36.480
We are starting over, says the Mortal Kombat team.

11:36.480 --> 11:41.460
As they go into Mortal Kombat 1, they really did some in-depth gameplay for this, and then

11:41.460 --> 11:46.820
some of the crazy changes that are going on as well, and the Cameo system, which will

11:46.820 --> 11:50.460
let you call in additional characters to help during a fight.

11:50.460 --> 11:56.180
So you can bring in Baraka, Goro, Striker, and Sonya are some examples of Cameo fighters.

11:56.180 --> 12:03.300
So that's an interesting kind of, it feels very like Capcom fighter from the 90s, where

12:03.300 --> 12:05.300
you would tag team people.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.620
They don't take it, they just come in to do a move.

12:07.620 --> 12:10.340
There was absolutely a Capcom fighter like that, more than one.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.700
Yeah, more than one.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.980
There's several where you just tag them in and they do a move.

12:14.980 --> 12:16.180
Yeah, yeah.

12:16.180 --> 12:18.620
That one, Superheroes and Street Fighters, the one I definitely remember.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.740
So that'll be fun.

12:20.740 --> 12:24.420
So Mortal Kombat 1, I think people are very excited about.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.380
That is coming out September 19th.

12:26.380 --> 12:30.600
So the nice thing about the Mortal Kombat team, they usually don't tease games until

12:30.600 --> 12:31.760
they're about ready to go.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.740
So Mortal Kombat 1 is out in just a few months.

12:34.740 --> 12:38.180
Sonic Superstars, this looked kind of cool too.

12:38.180 --> 12:43.140
This is going to involve multiple playable characters, co-op gameplay for up to four

12:43.140 --> 12:47.420
people and you can run up walls and waterfalls.

12:47.420 --> 12:53.100
That's going to be out for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X, and Nintendo Switch all this

12:53.100 --> 12:54.100
fall.

12:54.100 --> 12:59.220
So a little bit more of like a, I don't, I always say like a kind of like more of a game

12:59.220 --> 13:03.180
in Sonic's roots a little bit.

13:03.180 --> 13:09.100
Because it's not, it's not like the more recent title, but it definitely looks, it looks very

13:09.100 --> 13:10.100
cool.

13:10.100 --> 13:14.140
It's a bit more like Mania, you know, like more of the classics on the game, the last

13:14.140 --> 13:19.460
one they went really in the other direction, everyone's like, no, don't do that.

13:19.460 --> 13:23.820
Well, the vibe I kind of get from it, honestly, and not, not completely, but like just a vibe

13:23.820 --> 13:29.420
is the new Super Mario Brothers games that were on like Wii U and stuff, which were four

13:29.420 --> 13:30.420
player.

13:30.420 --> 13:31.740
That's kind of like the vibe I get from it.

13:31.740 --> 13:36.460
It's kind of like that, but for Sonic, but like not a literal clone, like it's, it's

13:36.460 --> 13:37.980
doing its very Sonic thing.

13:37.980 --> 13:41.300
Like these, it looks very chaotic and fun, honestly.

13:41.300 --> 13:46.340
Yeah, I think this Sonic title, I'm going to be quite honest, looks more exciting than

13:46.340 --> 13:50.300
a lot of Sonic titles have been in a long time for me, just because it invokes like

13:50.300 --> 13:52.020
that classic Sonic feel to it.

13:52.020 --> 13:53.380
You know what I mean?

13:53.380 --> 13:56.540
So Sonic Superstars, really looking forward to that.

13:56.540 --> 14:02.020
A horror game called Toxic Commando is coming from one of the all time greats in horror,

14:02.020 --> 14:04.940
John Carpenter and Saber Interactive.

14:04.940 --> 14:08.100
You'll be fighting zombies with guns and vehicles.

14:08.100 --> 14:12.420
Yeah, just John Carpenter's name alone on this is going to make people pay attention.

14:12.420 --> 14:16.020
I can't say I blame them for that.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.180
And we got Spider-Man 2.

14:18.180 --> 14:20.980
This is probably one of the other big reveals out of the whole thing.

14:20.980 --> 14:25.740
We have a date, October 20th, exclusive to the PlayStation 5, of course.

14:25.740 --> 14:32.980
We have Spider-Man 2 is going to be coming out and Queens and Brooklyn are fully explorable

14:33.020 --> 14:37.020
in the game because it's a very open world type of game and rooted in New York.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.720
So that'll be very cool.

14:38.720 --> 14:44.000
If you are a Fortnite fan, chapter four, season three is coming out.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.900
It's called Wilds and the big new character in this is going to be Optimus Prime.

14:48.900 --> 14:54.820
So if you want to play as a transformer in Fortnite, if you want to be a transformer

14:54.820 --> 15:01.700
fighting Ariana Grande, wielding Jedi superpowers, Fortnite is now the game for you because it's

15:01.700 --> 15:06.120
literally the blender of all these pop culture things, which is what they've been saying

15:06.120 --> 15:08.620
for quite some time.

15:08.620 --> 15:11.780
There's one more pretty major thing I'm going to let Dark Soccer talk about in a minute,

15:11.780 --> 15:14.340
but I want to do some other quick hits here.

15:14.340 --> 15:17.340
New trailer for Path of Exile 2.

15:17.340 --> 15:22.660
Exo Primal is going to get some skins for the mechs based on Street Fighter 6, Ryu and

15:22.660 --> 15:23.660
Guile.

15:23.660 --> 15:26.660
Tiny bit of a deeper dive on Nicolas Cage in Dead by Daylight.

15:26.660 --> 15:31.420
And of course, Nicolas Cage actually showed up to basically give the, I'm Nicolas Cage

15:31.460 --> 15:33.940
and I approve this message type of thing.

15:33.940 --> 15:35.780
That's going to be coming out on July 25th.

15:35.780 --> 15:37.780
His model doesn't look anything like him.

15:37.780 --> 15:38.780
I mean, barely.

15:38.780 --> 15:39.780
It's a mild resemblance.

15:39.780 --> 15:42.300
It looks a lot like him.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.340
Looks better.

15:44.340 --> 15:48.180
It's hot Nicolas Cage, I'm on down with the model to be honest.

15:48.180 --> 15:52.140
The facial structure is there, the expressions there, it's pretty dead on.

15:52.140 --> 15:54.620
It's younger, which is, you know, it's fine.

15:54.620 --> 16:00.780
I mean, it's meant to be a video game, it's Nick Cage.

16:00.780 --> 16:04.660
Also The Witcher Season 3 Volume 1 had a new trailer.

16:04.660 --> 16:10.300
Witchfire is going to be entering early access on the Epic Game Store September 20th.

16:10.300 --> 16:15.100
New gameplay trailer showed off for Remnant 2, a live action trailer and a release date

16:15.100 --> 16:18.620
in August for Crossfire Sierra Squad.

16:18.620 --> 16:22.780
PlayStation 5 is going to be getting the game that I'm seeing more and more of on Twitch.

16:22.780 --> 16:27.200
Honkai Star Rail is going to be coming out on PlayStation 5 during Quarter 4 this year.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.960
That of course from the same people that brought Genshin Impact, so it's a similar

16:30.960 --> 16:36.500
vibe, although it's a little more standard RPG mechanics from what I understand.

16:36.500 --> 16:40.000
Lies of P got a demo and a release date of September 19th.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah, it looks pretty good.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.600
Sand Land based on Akira Toriyama's Sand Land, a game that's going to be based on that.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.640
It's coming out.

16:49.640 --> 16:55.620
Annapurna mentioned they're going to be doing their own showcase on June 29th to show off

16:55.620 --> 16:57.780
some upcoming games.

16:57.780 --> 17:02.680
New free-to-play MMO Throne and Liberty with a trailer, War Haven with a new trailer, Party

17:02.680 --> 17:09.140
Animals with a release date, Dying Light 2 has some gameplay updates, Alan Wake 2 had

17:09.140 --> 17:12.980
an extended gameplay video and Keely had interviewed Sam Lake on stage.

17:12.980 --> 17:15.780
I think a lot of people are very excited about Alan Wake 2.

17:15.780 --> 17:19.140
I'm definitely excited to see what music they've licensed for it because the first game had

17:19.140 --> 17:21.460
an amazing soundtrack, that's for sure.

17:21.460 --> 17:27.700
Yes, Your Grace Snowfall, which is a sequel, got a 2024 release window.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.420
There was an awful lot going on.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.460
A lot of it was finally some dates, really, for some things.

17:32.460 --> 17:39.460
A limited Xbox Series X for the Porsche's 75th anniversary.

17:39.460 --> 17:44.940
Star Trek Infinite, a 4X game from Paradox, is going to be coming out as well.

17:44.940 --> 17:49.780
There's a game I missed that you wanted to mention, by all means do so, and there's one

17:49.780 --> 17:51.780
more, actually.

17:51.780 --> 17:59.620
Also we got a clip from the new Twisted Metal show, which, eh, is alright.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.780
Loki's being very generous, in my opinion.

18:01.780 --> 18:08.780
I guess maybe if you enjoy bad shit- Here's the thing, I know it's trash.

18:08.780 --> 18:14.740
I know it's trash, it's like Fast Five, or like the Fast and the Furious series.

18:14.740 --> 18:18.380
I know going in it's going to be trash.

18:18.380 --> 18:21.380
I've set my expectation for trash.

18:21.380 --> 18:22.380
I'm fine with that.

18:22.380 --> 18:32.900
I like Anthony Mackie, and I like Will Arnett, so I'm ready for trash in the Twisted Metal

18:32.900 --> 18:33.900
world.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.260
I don't expect anything great out of it.

18:36.260 --> 18:42.180
And I'm happy for you, Loki, and that's about where my excitement ends.

18:42.180 --> 18:45.420
But in all seriousness, I think something all three of us can get behind, this was the

18:45.420 --> 18:48.220
one that everyone was talking about, Dark Sakura.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.460
What was the big, big reveal of this show?

18:50.460 --> 18:59.220
It was Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is the second installation of the remake series.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.460
And it's very pretty.

19:01.460 --> 19:02.460
Very pretty.

19:02.460 --> 19:08.260
It's supposed to be like the middle part of the game, where you're outside wandering around,

19:08.260 --> 19:13.140
going hither and yon.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.260
It's very pretty.

19:15.260 --> 19:19.180
I like the voice acting.

19:19.180 --> 19:27.620
I can see where they're going with the foreshadowing in there too, so that's pretty good.

19:27.620 --> 19:32.540
And I feel like they really are now flexing that they're going to do whatever the fuck

19:32.540 --> 19:33.540
they want in this.

19:33.540 --> 19:38.660
I mean, I know you mentioned they're following the story a little bit, but okay, there's

19:38.660 --> 19:42.300
this whole interesting thing that came out about in the Japanese version of the trailer.

19:42.300 --> 19:45.500
So something that happens towards the end of the trailer is that there's this whole

19:45.500 --> 19:52.420
scene where it looks like Sephiroth is looking at Tifa or something, and he actually says

19:52.420 --> 19:58.620
something in the Japanese trailer about, I killed Tifa or something like that.

19:58.620 --> 20:02.360
I don't remember what the words were, but obviously they're not going to give away a

20:02.360 --> 20:05.300
bombshell thing like that in the trailer.

20:05.300 --> 20:11.220
It's obviously some type of mind fuck, like was it a fake version or an alternate reality

20:11.220 --> 20:15.680
version because obviously there's something going on because you can't say I killed this

20:15.680 --> 20:18.220
person and then the person is sitting right in front of you.

20:18.220 --> 20:22.940
There's obviously some weird shit going on, but there's just that whole concept of, wait

20:22.940 --> 20:28.120
a minute, they might kill somebody besides Aerith, which, spoiler alert, already happened

20:28.120 --> 20:35.000
in the first game, and then he was brought back to life, but in the second game, clearly

20:35.000 --> 20:36.060
they can do whatever they want.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.060
But I just-

20:37.060 --> 20:38.060
Hold on.

20:38.060 --> 20:39.060
Oh, what?

20:39.580 --> 20:41.780
I'm going to see what he said.

20:41.780 --> 20:43.620
I'm going to hear it for myself.

20:43.620 --> 20:44.620
Oh, okay.

20:44.620 --> 20:51.220
Yeah, there's a translation version somewhere out there with subtitles.

20:51.220 --> 20:54.940
But anyway, while you're checking that out, I will just mention, just because I've had

20:54.940 --> 21:00.160
that kind of year, I do want to say about six years ago when this series was first announced,

21:00.160 --> 21:04.260
I said they can do whatever the hell they want this time, and I think they'll kill Tifa

21:04.260 --> 21:06.900
instead of Aerith just to get fanboys upset.

21:06.900 --> 21:15.900
So by God, if that does come true, I'm writing a book, why I'm so goddamn smart at video

21:15.900 --> 21:17.700
games by Rob Roberts.

21:17.700 --> 21:23.860
One thing though I should point out is that the scene there, at least as far as how it

21:23.860 --> 21:27.660
was in the old game, was from their flashback.

21:27.660 --> 21:33.240
She wore that outfit as like a tour guide or something when they found the Genova facility

21:33.240 --> 21:35.540
the first time.

21:35.540 --> 21:39.980
So that's all in flashback.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.260
So Mishkins in chat says, I feel like that might be a dream sequence, like someone's

21:43.260 --> 21:44.260
having a dream.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.860
And in it they say, I killed Tifa.

21:45.860 --> 21:46.860
Oh yeah, there's absolutely...

21:46.860 --> 21:50.140
Well, they didn't say I killed Tifa, he said, I killed her.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.140
Who is she?

21:51.140 --> 21:54.300
No, they're talking about the Japanese version.

21:54.300 --> 21:56.740
In the Japanese one, they say, yeah.

21:56.740 --> 22:02.840
But here's the thing, look, it's not worth over-analyzing because they do misdirects

22:02.840 --> 22:04.920
in movie trailers all the time.

22:04.920 --> 22:11.600
Or because I love to relate everything to RuPaul's Drag Race, there was a scene in the

22:11.600 --> 22:16.080
trailer for season five where Alaska goes, I've had it with everybody.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.200
She goes, I fucking hate it here.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.460
And then you find out it was like, she's acting.

22:20.460 --> 22:24.860
And they got her to say that in the clip, like had nothing to do with her actually being

22:24.860 --> 22:25.860
mad at anybody.

22:25.860 --> 22:29.820
Like it's just, they do that type of misdirect shit all the time in trailers just to get

22:29.820 --> 22:30.820
you riled up.

22:30.820 --> 22:36.300
So, did you want to say anything else on that, Darcyra?

22:36.300 --> 22:41.580
I listened to the phrase and he literally did said, I'm the one that killed Tifa.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.580
Yeah.

22:42.580 --> 22:43.580
So...

22:43.580 --> 22:45.020
I went to listen to it.

22:45.020 --> 22:51.220
But if you, again, I think in the very beginning of that trailer, you see all of the characters

22:51.220 --> 22:56.540
coming out in stretchers and Midgar, so something weird's going on.

22:56.540 --> 23:00.700
So it's, it's just, and if you played the first game, you know, there's all sorts of

23:00.700 --> 23:04.780
weird timeline fuckery and things that have been altered from its original state and so

23:04.780 --> 23:05.780
forth.

23:05.780 --> 23:11.800
You know, it's, again, I can't keep hiding the major twists in Final Fantasy Remake from

23:11.800 --> 23:15.660
you much longer because they're going to be essential to Rebirth and talking about the

23:15.660 --> 23:18.340
game and why it's going to go in a different direction.

23:18.340 --> 23:24.300
So but yeah, it's, I was very hyped for the trailer.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.900
Oh, you know, the other part of the trailer that was huge news.

23:27.900 --> 23:31.060
It says it's two discs.

23:31.060 --> 23:32.060
Excuse me?

23:32.060 --> 23:33.980
Taking all of your storage space.

23:33.980 --> 23:34.980
Excuse me?

23:34.980 --> 23:38.820
This game is so big, you need two Blu-rays.

23:38.820 --> 23:46.180
One Blu-ray disc is not enough to handle the second part of a game.

23:46.180 --> 23:49.900
That's big news too, as far as I'm concerned.

23:49.900 --> 23:54.180
RIP to the bandwidth caps of those that still have them for those that decide to get the

23:54.180 --> 23:55.760
game digitally.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.760
My goodness.

23:56.760 --> 24:00.060
Well, if you have a PlayStation 5 digital edition.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.060
Oops.

24:01.060 --> 24:02.060
Oops.

24:02.060 --> 24:03.060
Yeah.

24:03.060 --> 24:07.220
I hope you have unlimited bandwidth or something or you're going to be playing on the cloud.

24:07.220 --> 24:08.220
I don't know.

24:08.220 --> 24:11.500
Or you can maybe like download like the first part and then the second part the following

24:11.500 --> 24:12.500
month or something like that.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.500
I don't know.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.740
Quest Buster does point out Horizon Forbidden West is also on two discs.

24:16.740 --> 24:18.100
Oh, even on PS5 it was?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.100
I did not know that.

24:19.300 --> 24:20.300
Okay.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.180
But I'd also kind of believe it.

24:23.180 --> 24:26.100
Quest Buster says, get a snack for long installs.

24:26.100 --> 24:29.900
Mike Def says, 200 gigabytes plus updates.

24:29.900 --> 24:35.200
Well, look Square, you better minimize those day one updates.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.100
Let me tell you, because by the way, the other thing that they snuck in a pushback, did you

24:39.100 --> 24:42.440
notice they snuck in a delay with that game as well?

24:42.440 --> 24:46.660
Now it's quarter one 2024, because it was supposed to be this year, because remember

24:46.660 --> 24:50.900
we were talking about, oh, Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 part two in the same

24:50.900 --> 24:51.900
year.

24:51.900 --> 24:52.900
Wow.

24:52.900 --> 24:58.120
And I, again, I don't want to toot my own horn, but I was saying several weeks ago,

24:58.120 --> 25:01.000
it's probably going to slip in the first quarter.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
And here we are.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.640
And, but it's, I don't think it's a big deal, especially now when you hear like exactly

25:05.640 --> 25:07.580
how much is going into the game.

25:07.580 --> 25:12.120
And quite frankly, again, if a delay can minimize those day one patches, I think most people

25:12.120 --> 25:18.720
will be very grateful to hear it, quite honestly, so.

25:18.720 --> 25:24.120
They've also been teasing things on Twitter about that game, basically that like, it ranges

25:24.120 --> 25:31.640
from the really fucking obvious to the not so obvious, like, yes, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth

25:31.640 --> 25:38.800
will have a new soundtrack with some new songs, as well as remixed songs from the original.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.500
Holy fucking shit, what an announcement.

25:41.500 --> 25:45.540
Like what a breaking news alarm of Final Fantasy 7.

25:45.540 --> 25:46.540
Oh my god.

25:46.540 --> 25:49.540
Video game to have soundtrack?

25:49.540 --> 25:50.700
What?

25:50.700 --> 25:51.700
You don't say.

25:51.700 --> 25:54.540
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.

25:54.540 --> 25:55.540
What?

25:55.540 --> 25:56.540
I just went back.

25:56.540 --> 26:00.380
I know I keep going back to the thing you said, what he actually says is I should have

26:00.380 --> 26:01.380
killed Tifa.

26:01.380 --> 26:02.380
Hmm.

26:02.380 --> 26:03.380
Interesting.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.380
All right.

26:04.380 --> 26:05.380
Well, look.

26:05.380 --> 26:06.380
Anyway.

26:06.380 --> 26:08.460
We'll find out in a few months.

26:08.460 --> 26:14.500
But the other thing, then there also was one that said basically the developers feel you

26:14.500 --> 26:18.980
don't have to play the first game to pick up this game, which is the smart thing to

26:18.980 --> 26:24.260
do, you know, because let's be real, there are some people that are going to be 21 when

26:24.260 --> 26:29.880
this game comes out that were like 16 or 17 when the other one came out.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.540
And maybe they're just now getting around to buying their own PS5 and what have you,

26:33.540 --> 26:34.540
you know, whatever.

26:34.540 --> 26:35.620
There's a variety of reasons.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.260
People may have just missed the first game or don't want to put the time into play it,

26:38.260 --> 26:39.620
but want to play this one.

26:39.620 --> 26:42.780
So it's nice that they'll have a catch up.

26:42.780 --> 26:44.460
Here's the thing, though.

26:44.460 --> 26:49.060
It doesn't mean it'll be a good catch up mechanic, but if they're smart, they'll put out one

26:49.060 --> 26:56.100
of those things on YouTube that's like recapping the first Final Fantasy 7 game in seven minutes.

26:56.100 --> 27:00.700
That's what they should do if they are, you know, wanting to make sure they get everybody

27:00.700 --> 27:02.860
up to speed, which I mean, you could.

27:02.860 --> 27:07.060
You could recap the key points of the game in seven minutes and be up to speed.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.020
So we'll see.

27:09.020 --> 27:10.700
All right.

27:10.700 --> 27:11.780
That was Summer Game Fest.

27:11.780 --> 27:13.260
How did you feel about it?

27:13.260 --> 27:15.980
Did you watch the event live, Loki, or some of it?

27:15.980 --> 27:16.980
Yes, I did.

27:16.980 --> 27:17.980
What did you think?

27:17.980 --> 27:20.300
Because again, I had to kind of watch the highlight reel after the fact.

27:20.300 --> 27:22.660
I want to get your take on how was it live.

27:22.660 --> 27:27.660
Do you think it was a worthy press event successor to some of the E3 hype?

27:27.660 --> 27:28.820
Like, where's your head at with it?

27:28.820 --> 27:30.740
It's about what it was last year.

27:30.740 --> 27:31.740
It wasn't anything.

27:31.740 --> 27:33.100
It was like, it was all right.

27:33.100 --> 27:37.420
You know, still hoping for granted that six trailers, but that never happens.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.940
So, you know, I'll just leave disappointed.

27:39.940 --> 27:41.780
But no, it was OK.

27:41.780 --> 27:44.540
Like I think they had some pretty good stuff in there.

27:44.540 --> 27:45.540
Yeah.

27:45.540 --> 27:50.200
I think one thing it did is it set up the holiday pretty well, you know, especially

27:50.200 --> 27:54.020
for things that are outside of the big three, you know, outside of Sony.

27:54.020 --> 27:58.540
And there even was stuff in a little bit from, you know, with Sony and Spider-Man and stuff.

27:58.540 --> 28:02.660
But otherwise, for the most part, you know, the big three kind of do their own things

28:02.700 --> 28:07.340
and what have you, it set up the holiday very well for what you would expect from E3 otherwise.

28:07.340 --> 28:11.380
Because if you think about it, most of what you would see on the show floor at E3, especially

28:11.380 --> 28:14.940
the things that were playable, were things that were going to be coming out that holiday.

28:14.940 --> 28:19.500
And there's something to be said about in later years, especially how you would start

28:19.500 --> 28:22.060
seeing later and later things getting announced.

28:22.060 --> 28:25.960
But in the heydays of E3, it was really about what was going to be out that holiday, what

28:25.960 --> 28:28.320
should be out on store shelves.

28:28.320 --> 28:32.220
And I think a lot of the updates and the things that they were showing, it was setting up

28:32.220 --> 28:37.140
the holiday very well for a plethora of third parties and all these...

28:37.140 --> 28:41.380
I don't want to group it together under miscellaneous content because that makes it sound very like

28:41.380 --> 28:44.960
other and unimportant, but that's really, you know, outside the big three, that's really

28:44.960 --> 28:45.960
what it was.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.700
So I feel like it did a very good job where E3 does not exist anymore of setting up the

28:49.700 --> 28:51.840
holiday for everybody else.

28:51.840 --> 28:55.700
And that's kind of what I got out of Summer Game Fest as a whole.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.620
So could it have been better?

28:58.620 --> 29:02.740
Maybe, but I feel like some of the big publishers want to save some of it for themselves, you

29:02.740 --> 29:04.620
know, and that's just the reality.

29:04.620 --> 29:11.500
There's still a lot of different press events that are showcases, people that are coming

29:11.500 --> 29:12.500
later this month.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.820
So, yeah, a lot of that's going to be kind of held back until those come out.

29:15.820 --> 29:16.820
Yeah.

29:16.820 --> 29:17.820
I would say it's...

29:17.820 --> 29:20.100
I know we're going to talk about it later in the show, but I would say it's a far better

29:20.100 --> 29:26.100
miscellaneous event than the PC gaming show, but we'll talk about that later.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.180
Let's go on a heyday.

29:27.180 --> 29:34.540
I thought this was another relatively strong announcement, was this morning's Xbox event.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.840
Loki, I'll turn it over to you.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.900
This one I did watch live, but I'm kind of curious on your take and walk us through some

29:39.900 --> 29:41.900
of the things that were announced.

29:41.900 --> 29:45.660
So they had a bunch of different trailers for different things that we were anticipating

29:45.660 --> 29:47.620
trailers being there.

29:47.620 --> 29:53.020
So one of those being Fable, they showed off a cinematic trailer that kind of let you know,

29:53.020 --> 29:54.460
hey, we're still working on it.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.460
And I liked it.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.460
I thought it was funny.

29:56.740 --> 29:59.340
Well, and Richard Ayode being in it is huge.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.540
Yeah, that was fantastic.

30:01.540 --> 30:05.140
Yeah, literally huge.

30:05.140 --> 30:11.500
My one bitch about the Fable thing, though, was that like the gameplay, it was there,

30:11.500 --> 30:13.380
but it was blink an eye and you'll miss it.

30:13.380 --> 30:18.580
I'm pretty sure that whole sequence where the hero, she was running from the giant thing.

30:18.580 --> 30:21.900
I think that was gameplay.

30:21.900 --> 30:22.900
That was it, though.

30:23.220 --> 30:28.300
I still don't have a sense of like, look, we haven't really had a Fable game in a really

30:28.300 --> 30:34.180
long time, and I'm excited for playground games to kind of like get to do their take

30:34.180 --> 30:36.420
on it in the Forza engine and everything.

30:36.420 --> 30:41.780
So I was hoping for a little more about like, what is the game actually going to be type

30:41.780 --> 30:42.780
of thing.

30:42.780 --> 30:48.740
And I just feel like, OK, it's going to have the dry British sense of humor stuff.

30:48.740 --> 30:49.740
That's fine.

30:49.740 --> 30:50.740
Which it does.

30:50.740 --> 30:51.740
It does.

30:51.740 --> 30:52.740
Yeah, it was cute.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.180
You're not losing that.

30:54.180 --> 30:56.740
It looks like the story will be cute.

30:56.740 --> 31:03.500
But I was just hoping for a little more of the game to excite me and keep me going after

31:03.500 --> 31:06.100
years and years of nothing on the Fable front.

31:06.100 --> 31:07.820
That's my only little bitch.

31:07.820 --> 31:12.540
But I, you know, the fact that they have the star power now with Richard Aida and everything

31:12.540 --> 31:14.500
is great.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.500
So yeah.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.500
Yeah.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.980
And that is unfortunately, a lot of the trailers don't really show much as far as gameplay

31:20.980 --> 31:21.980
goes.

31:22.100 --> 31:26.980
Let me get some other comments from chat, sorry, over twitch.tv slash vog network.

31:26.980 --> 31:31.180
She Hulk 10 says, well, as far as I'm concerned, this new Fable looked nothing like Fable.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.540
The trailer is just there to say, hey, this game exists.

31:33.540 --> 31:34.940
Trust us.

31:34.940 --> 31:37.540
Starfield saved the show, which we'll talk a little bit about that later.

31:37.540 --> 31:42.660
SG100Matt says, I was meh on a new Fable game, but with playground games doing it, that got

31:42.660 --> 31:43.660
my interest.

31:43.660 --> 31:44.660
Yeah.

31:44.660 --> 31:47.300
The developers there, the humor is there.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.180
The star power is there.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.740
Is the game there?

31:50.820 --> 31:51.900
I think it's going to be good.

31:51.900 --> 31:52.900
I hope.

31:52.900 --> 31:53.900
I hope.

31:53.900 --> 31:54.900
But I, okay.

31:54.900 --> 31:55.900
Okay.

31:55.900 --> 31:58.100
So clearly this is not happening this year.

31:58.100 --> 32:04.300
So you're, you're, they need a pass until holiday 2024 yet, but I hope the gameplay

32:04.300 --> 32:08.980
trailer that inevitably comes next year is real good.

32:08.980 --> 32:09.980
Real good.

32:09.980 --> 32:12.100
As far as it looking like Fable, I'm okay.

32:12.100 --> 32:16.580
If they've got a radically different direction, it has been like 10 years and it's a new studio.

32:16.580 --> 32:21.060
So I'm, I'm okay if it, you know, they've kind of turned the car around, so to speak

32:21.060 --> 32:22.660
and gone a different direction with it.

32:22.660 --> 32:23.660
Yeah.

32:23.660 --> 32:24.660
All right.

32:24.660 --> 32:25.660
Anyway.

32:25.660 --> 32:26.660
Sorry.

32:26.660 --> 32:27.660
I have a lot to say on Fable though.

32:27.660 --> 32:31.140
So there was, um, a lot of these member of those games, all the different game studios

32:31.140 --> 32:32.460
that they purchased way back.

32:32.460 --> 32:33.900
It's been a while now.

32:33.900 --> 32:37.220
Um, well now we're starting to see all those games that are in development.

32:37.220 --> 32:43.420
So for example, from the devs that did We Happy Few, we had South of Midnight, which

32:43.420 --> 32:45.140
it was kind of a cinematic trailer.

32:45.140 --> 32:48.820
Not really sure what the gameplay is going to be there, but it looks interesting.

32:48.820 --> 32:54.580
Kind of like this whole like Voodoo Bayou type of a vibe to it, which I like.

32:54.580 --> 33:01.700
And then, um, we've got a little peek at Star Wars Outlaws, which is an Ubisoft Star Wars

33:01.700 --> 33:02.700
game.

33:02.700 --> 33:06.440
And they're going to be showing more of that at the Ubisoft showcase, uh, which is coming

33:06.440 --> 33:07.900
out later this month.

33:07.900 --> 33:11.740
That looked interesting, but again, it was a case of too much trailer and not enough

33:11.740 --> 33:12.740
game.

33:13.060 --> 33:16.780
But if you're a Star Wars fan, you were horny for it.

33:16.780 --> 33:17.780
I'm sure you were.

33:17.780 --> 33:21.540
It looked really, really, really good just from like a Star Wars lore perspective.

33:21.540 --> 33:26.660
So yeah, and it's at least, at least it's coupled with this thing is coming in like

33:26.660 --> 33:27.660
a day or two.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.220
So like Ubisoft's going to show the gameplay.

33:29.220 --> 33:31.180
It's just, we have to wait just a couple more days.

33:31.180 --> 33:35.340
So kind of those two things together, I'm a lot more okay with what they did.

33:35.340 --> 33:36.340
Yeah.

33:36.420 --> 33:42.580
From, um, the devs of Spiritfarer, we had a game called 33, uh, what was it?

33:42.580 --> 33:44.540
Uh, 33 Immortals, I think.

33:44.540 --> 33:45.540
Yeah.

33:45.540 --> 33:47.540
Hades inspired games now it looks like.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.540
Yeah.

33:48.540 --> 33:49.540
Yeah.

33:49.540 --> 33:50.540
Like multiplayer.

33:50.540 --> 33:53.020
It's a 33 player co-op game.

33:53.020 --> 33:54.620
I mean, that sounds cool.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.940
Honestly like Hades 99 or whatever.

33:56.940 --> 33:58.040
I'm here for it.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.420
Like that could be really fun actually.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.220
So um, yeah, neat.

34:02.220 --> 34:03.220
Yeah.

34:03.220 --> 34:04.220
That looked pretty cool.

34:04.220 --> 34:10.700
Uh, Payday three as announced there is it's coming on game pass as well and it looks like

34:10.700 --> 34:11.700
payday.

34:11.700 --> 34:12.700
So, okay.

34:12.700 --> 34:13.700
Okay.

34:13.700 --> 34:14.700
Um, can I be honest?

34:14.700 --> 34:15.700
Loki?

34:15.700 --> 34:16.700
Look, I know you like the payday games.

34:16.700 --> 34:19.540
I, I'm not really a fan of the payday game.

34:19.540 --> 34:20.540
I'm sorry.

34:20.540 --> 34:22.060
I just have to be honest.

34:22.060 --> 34:29.620
The parts in game of payday did not look current gen to me and it didn't, it did not look,

34:29.620 --> 34:33.860
it looked very plain.

34:33.860 --> 34:35.500
It just, it is not exciting.

34:35.500 --> 34:39.340
It was not exciting, but maybe these are because I don't get into these kinds of games usually

34:39.340 --> 34:45.880
admittedly, but I just, this trailer like made me go this, I'm supposed to get excited

34:45.880 --> 34:48.420
about this cause I, I didn't at all.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.540
Like it just, it was, it was almost kind of bad.

34:50.540 --> 34:51.540
I'm sorry.

34:51.540 --> 34:55.560
I feel, I always feel bad when I shit on games before I've played them, but like I was not

34:55.560 --> 34:57.820
excited about what I saw at all.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.660
Um, let's see what else.

35:00.660 --> 35:02.940
We had a persona three reloaded.

35:02.940 --> 35:08.220
So our persona three reload, which is going to be coming to game pass as well.

35:08.220 --> 35:10.060
Uh, so that's like pretty neat.

35:10.060 --> 35:12.300
Did you hear about everything persona three doesn't have in it though?

35:12.300 --> 35:16.940
It has like none of the extra content and they replaced all of the voice actors.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.740
All of the voice actors are new.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.180
Well here's the weird thing.

35:20.180 --> 35:25.060
Like for the most part, yes, I would agree, but I feel like the whole thing was done to

35:25.060 --> 35:30.300
get rid of one voice actor in particular whose name is Vic McGoon.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.400
Yeah.

35:31.400 --> 35:36.840
So I have a feeling, unfortunately, contraction on stuff in order to get the association with

35:36.840 --> 35:40.600
that guy gone, they had to replace everybody.

35:40.600 --> 35:44.200
And so it makes that whole thing very complicated.

35:44.200 --> 35:53.880
Uh, so yeah, uh, we got the, uh, Skyrim looking game from Obsidian avowed, uh, trailer for

35:53.880 --> 35:54.880
that.

35:54.880 --> 35:55.880
That looks pretty awesome.

35:55.880 --> 36:00.040
It's, it's going to be, it's going to, you know, scratch my elder scrolls itch until

36:00.040 --> 36:01.400
there's drill six comes out.

36:01.400 --> 36:06.240
Well, I guess Starfield do that too, but here's, here's, here's the thing about avowed and

36:06.240 --> 36:08.940
a lot of games, frankly, that I saw at the Xbox event.

36:08.940 --> 36:14.000
And I find like I'm always walking out of these Xbox events thinking this avowed was

36:14.000 --> 36:17.600
something where I was like, okay, I don't, I'd have to see more on this.

36:17.600 --> 36:21.520
Like in the traditional, how I evaluate game sense, I would usually go, okay, I need to

36:21.520 --> 36:22.880
see more about this.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.560
I need to do is deep dive to know if this is worth spending 70 bucks on.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.280
Like I need to know more about this.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.280
I see more game play.

36:29.520 --> 36:34.240
I need to get maybe some sense from some critics I trust or some friends, like if this is going

36:34.240 --> 36:35.240
to be worth 70 bucks.

36:35.240 --> 36:39.400
But the thing about the Xbox events, I get to measure it to different criteria because

36:39.400 --> 36:42.320
I go, oh cool, this is on game pass.

36:42.320 --> 36:45.720
This just validates me hanging onto my subscription and yeah, hell yeah, I'm going to download

36:45.720 --> 36:47.600
this day one and check it out.

36:47.600 --> 36:54.720
Like it really changes the criteria of how I approach a lot of games that are shown like,

36:54.720 --> 36:58.200
and again, sorry not to be a bitch, but like payday three didn't even look like it was

36:58.200 --> 36:59.600
worth the bandwidth.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.600
Sorry about it.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.840
But, but you know what?

37:01.840 --> 37:06.160
Maybe it was for somebody else who could give two shits about avowed and that's okay.

37:06.160 --> 37:10.220
That's the beauty about a diverse plate of games that you bring to the table at these

37:10.220 --> 37:11.600
announcement things.

37:11.600 --> 37:12.600
Great.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.260
But avowed, I definitely was like, okay, cool.

37:14.260 --> 37:15.260
That's going to be on game pass.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.260
Fuck you.

37:16.260 --> 37:17.260
I'll check it out.

37:17.260 --> 37:18.260
Cool.

37:18.260 --> 37:21.240
And I feel like as long as I'm walking away feeling like that from an Xbox thing, it's

37:21.240 --> 37:22.240
a win.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.240
That's true.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.240
Yeah.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.240
Yeah.

37:25.280 --> 37:28.400
I mean, there's like, like you said, there's something for everybody.

37:28.400 --> 37:35.160
So for example, people that play payday three may not be fans of, you know, a secret of

37:35.160 --> 37:36.400
monkey Island.

37:36.400 --> 37:40.800
So now we have the sea of thieves teaming up with the secret of monkey Island, do some

37:40.800 --> 37:46.680
sort of a new storyline thing that makes it sound way more interesting than the sea of

37:46.680 --> 37:47.680
thieves.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.680
That's for sure.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.080
That's a huge collab.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.240
That's a huge collab.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.240
Is it interesting enough for me to play it?

37:53.240 --> 37:56.360
I don't know, but it looks cool.

37:56.360 --> 38:00.280
I love me some, you know, a secret of monkey Island.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.280
I was getting pretty excited there.

38:01.280 --> 38:05.320
Then I saw a sea of thieves and I got less excited, but it was still neat to see.

38:05.320 --> 38:10.520
Well, I think again, because this is all game pass, I think one thing that Microsoft slash

38:10.520 --> 38:16.080
rare could do that would be very smart would be to put out some type of campaign or something

38:16.080 --> 38:22.680
or an event or do some marketing behind look, if you've missed sea of thieves all this time,

38:22.680 --> 38:28.200
here's how to catch up and feel like you're with it to do this monkey Island stuff like

38:28.200 --> 38:29.200
a little.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.800
And I'm sure they've got to be thinking this in the back of their mind.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.960
Like how do we catch people up who have never played this game, who are suddenly interested

38:34.960 --> 38:39.560
in it because of the Lucas arts collab, I think if they can kind of bring that a little

38:39.560 --> 38:43.560
bit more to the forefront of mind, I think that'll be a win for them.

38:43.560 --> 38:47.480
I think they could win me over if they could convince me that I could catch up relatively

38:47.480 --> 38:51.820
easy and be able to jump into this monkey Island stuff without feeling like I'm seven

38:51.820 --> 38:54.060
years behind on sea of thieves.

38:54.060 --> 38:57.500
Yeah, yeah.

38:57.500 --> 39:02.420
Then we got a trailer for what I thought was a flight sim update originally, but then it

39:02.420 --> 39:05.100
ends up being a whole new flight sim game.

39:05.100 --> 39:10.940
So what's going to be unique about flight sim 2024 is now they have a bunch of different

39:10.940 --> 39:13.540
jobs that you can do in the game.

39:13.540 --> 39:18.580
So like if you want to try your hand at you know, aerial firefighting, you can do that

39:18.580 --> 39:26.060
or cargo transport or rescue or, you know, all sorts of crazy stuff with that, which

39:26.060 --> 39:30.660
was really cool because kind of taking flight sim in a completely different direction with

39:30.660 --> 39:31.660
that stuff.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.460
So I'm definitely interested in hearing more about that.

39:34.460 --> 39:37.060
Yeah, I was a little surprised it wasn't an expansion.

39:37.060 --> 39:38.600
I thought that's where it was going at first.

39:38.600 --> 39:42.780
But then of course, again, going back to the game pass thing I just laid out, like does

39:42.780 --> 39:43.780
it matter?

39:43.780 --> 39:46.060
Because as long as you have game pass, you're going to get it anyway.

39:46.060 --> 39:49.620
And I will say again, flight sim is an excellent example of a game.

39:49.620 --> 39:53.620
I don't think I could justify dropping $70 on it because I'm terrible at flying the planes

39:53.620 --> 39:54.620
and all that.

39:54.620 --> 39:58.980
I need that mode where you start it and it like flies the plane for you and then you

39:58.980 --> 40:02.240
pick it up midway through like that, because you can do that in some of the adventure modes

40:02.240 --> 40:04.280
in the first flight sim.

40:04.280 --> 40:07.820
So you know, I like that, but I don't know if it's worth spending $70 on, but again,

40:07.820 --> 40:15.300
with game pass, like that flight sim is probably the, yeah, I'm going to say it's the best

40:15.340 --> 40:17.940
looking video game out there right now, period.

40:17.940 --> 40:20.880
Flight sim is the best looking video game out there right now.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.420
It's just a gorgeous, gorgeous game.

40:23.420 --> 40:27.620
And all this other stuff they're doing with it just, you know, even kicks that up more

40:27.620 --> 40:32.860
where it's like, okay, if just flying a plane is too boring for you, then here's like 20

40:32.860 --> 40:37.100
different jobs you could do in the game to give this a little bit more of like something

40:37.100 --> 40:40.220
to get you from A to B, for real.

40:41.220 --> 40:48.140
Then we had a trailer for, another trailer for Sasua Saga, Hellblade II, and they said

40:48.140 --> 40:51.940
that it's wrapped up shooting and it's coming out next year.

40:51.940 --> 40:52.940
So that looks interesting.

40:52.940 --> 40:53.940
It looks good.

40:53.940 --> 40:54.940
Okay.

40:54.940 --> 40:56.100
I'm going to say something unpopular about this game.

40:56.100 --> 40:59.060
It is time for this game to shit or get off the pot.

40:59.060 --> 41:02.080
It is like, I'm sick of the teases for this game.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.700
It has been how many years that they've been teasing this game.

41:04.700 --> 41:08.260
It's and I realize a good game takes time.

41:08.260 --> 41:14.500
I get, but we're getting to that like no man's sky pre-hype, what was the other game

41:14.500 --> 41:22.300
they drug out for years and years and years, Cyberpunk, that great example, exactly the

41:22.300 --> 41:24.940
worry I'm starting to have for this game.

41:24.940 --> 41:30.800
There is such a thing as too much hype and this game is getting dangerously close.

41:30.800 --> 41:36.340
The most exciting thing about that entire trailer was a release date for next year.

41:36.340 --> 41:40.620
And they, I swear to God, they better not delay it because I cannot take one more year

41:40.620 --> 41:42.180
of this game being teased.

41:42.180 --> 41:43.900
I'm sure it will be great.

41:43.900 --> 41:45.980
Look again, I'm not trying to shit on the game.

41:45.980 --> 41:49.300
I'm just saying how much hype is too much hype.

41:49.300 --> 41:54.700
We literally have some groundbreaking new trailer for this game every single year and

41:54.700 --> 41:56.220
I'm ready for something different.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.220
That's all.

41:57.220 --> 41:58.220
Yeah.

41:58.220 --> 42:02.260
Oh, Death's Draining would have been another one that did that too.

42:02.260 --> 42:03.380
Oh, good.

42:03.380 --> 42:04.380
Good example.

42:04.380 --> 42:05.380
Yeah.

42:05.420 --> 42:09.740
I mean, and again, none of those games are, well, maybe Cyberpunk, but now it's in a better

42:09.740 --> 42:11.340
state than it was maybe in the beginning.

42:11.340 --> 42:13.380
But you know, Death's Draining wasn't particularly bad.

42:13.380 --> 42:18.340
No man's sky, again, now it's great, you know, the beginning, you know, again, I'm not trying

42:18.340 --> 42:19.940
to crap on the quality of the game.

42:19.940 --> 42:23.600
I'm just saying there is such a thing as too much hype and a point where I'm like, I'm

42:23.600 --> 42:25.240
sick of hearing about it.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.140
And this game is getting there.

42:27.140 --> 42:31.380
It's like on the line.

42:31.380 --> 42:33.860
So let's see.

42:33.860 --> 42:42.100
We also had a trailer for Like a Dragon 8 called Infinite Wealth and it was silly.

42:42.100 --> 42:46.340
It's definitely felt like a like a dragon game.

42:46.340 --> 42:51.340
It felt like that fucking scene from Austin Powers with all the, yes, that was, that was

42:51.340 --> 42:54.540
objects discreetly covering.

42:54.540 --> 42:55.540
But you know what?

42:55.540 --> 42:58.580
I'm, I'm going to say this, I'm going to say this.

42:58.580 --> 43:04.780
I will give kudos to Sega and Microsoft for daring to show Ichiban's ass.

43:04.780 --> 43:05.780
I will.

43:05.780 --> 43:06.780
You know what?

43:06.780 --> 43:07.780
I will.

43:07.780 --> 43:13.620
Because how many times do we get to see, you know, cleavage, lady, lady butts and all these?

43:13.620 --> 43:19.980
I will, I will give props and on Pride Month nonetheless, I will give Microsoft and Sega

43:19.980 --> 43:24.180
their due props for not being afraid to show a butt.

43:24.180 --> 43:25.900
It's just a butt.

43:25.900 --> 43:28.540
Everybody's going to be talking about it for the next week.

43:28.540 --> 43:29.540
But you know what?

43:29.540 --> 43:33.500
Y'all, it's, it's, it's, it's just a butt.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.500
Yeah.

43:34.500 --> 43:36.700
We have another update coming to Fallout 76.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.980
They're adding Atlantic City.

43:38.980 --> 43:39.980
Cool.

43:39.980 --> 43:42.100
I'm still not interested in Fallout 76.

43:42.100 --> 43:47.100
I hear it is better than it used to be, but too little too late.

43:47.100 --> 43:48.860
Wait, wait, wait.

43:48.860 --> 43:52.460
You went by like a dragon too fast because I just wanted to say this, there's been a

43:52.460 --> 43:57.380
lot of confusion, but this is officially Yakuza 8 basically, which is now like a dragon

43:57.380 --> 43:58.380
is now the main series.

43:58.380 --> 44:03.500
This is like a dragon 8 and it is kind of exciting that it is in the, like it's very

44:03.500 --> 44:09.500
clearly and literally fish out of water situation, but it sounds like he's going to be in America.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.300
I mean, it looked very Santa Monica to me.

44:11.300 --> 44:16.060
I mean, some people were saying it was Hawaii maybe, but I thought maybe the abundance of

44:16.060 --> 44:20.300
blonde hair, blue eye folks in the scene was supposed to point to like a Santa Monica type

44:20.300 --> 44:21.300
of thing.

44:21.820 --> 44:27.540
So, but I like the idea of a Yakuza game taking place in America, or at least in part.

44:27.540 --> 44:31.420
It doesn't mean the whole thing's there because, you know, and like a dragon, you started in

44:31.420 --> 44:33.060
one place, but didn't stay there.

44:33.060 --> 44:34.060
Spoiler alert.

44:34.060 --> 44:39.260
But again, if even I know that after all this time, you can have that ruined for you.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.860
It's not, it's just the prologue anyway.

44:41.860 --> 44:46.720
But I think it'll be interesting to see how that goes into America.

44:46.720 --> 44:54.800
But yes, I need to see, I need to see that Yakuza like a dragon.

44:54.800 --> 44:55.800
I'm sorry.

44:55.800 --> 45:01.720
I have, so Orange Right has brought up a clip from the Game Awards 2022 and I have a feeling

45:01.720 --> 45:03.600
I know what I said in this clip.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.600
I'm sorry.

45:04.600 --> 45:08.400
You guys aren't going to be able to hear this, but I think I know what I said in this clip

45:08.400 --> 45:13.560
and it sounds like, it sounds like again, Rob Stardamus might've come true.

45:13.560 --> 45:14.560
I apologize to my co-host.

45:14.560 --> 45:18.880
You're not going to be able to hear this, but I'm going to play it here on the show

45:18.880 --> 45:19.880
here.

45:19.880 --> 45:20.880
Oops.

45:20.880 --> 45:21.880
I'm sorry.

45:21.880 --> 45:22.880
Let me do this.

45:22.880 --> 45:25.240
So this is a clip of Bobby and I doing the Game Awards in 2022.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.000
Thank you Orange Right for digging this up.

45:28.000 --> 45:34.720
I will never understand how these game trailers at these events can slice people in half,

45:34.720 --> 45:36.720
chop off heads.

45:36.720 --> 45:37.920
Okay.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.760
It's buffering quite a bit, unfortunately.

45:39.760 --> 45:43.400
So let me, I'm going to drop down the quality a little bit just because my poor bandwidth

45:43.400 --> 45:44.720
is probably doing a lot right now.

45:44.720 --> 45:49.440
I will never understand how these game trailers at these events can slice people in half,

45:49.440 --> 45:53.520
chop off heads, but heaven forbid we see a butt.

45:53.520 --> 45:59.680
Heaven forbid we see a butt in a trailer.

45:59.680 --> 46:06.320
So my, my point is to folks planning for the Game Awards 2023 or 2022, excuse me, leading

46:06.320 --> 46:08.800
into 2023, I want to see some butts.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.640
It can happen.

46:10.640 --> 46:12.640
And then you can slice them in half.

46:12.640 --> 46:16.880
That lets you butt first.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.160
Ew.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.280
Wow.

46:20.280 --> 46:21.280
My power.

46:21.280 --> 46:22.280
TBH.

46:22.280 --> 46:27.760
I mean, my ego is already getting pretty big this year, but how about that?

46:27.760 --> 46:29.800
Somebody from Sega was fucking listening to that.

46:29.800 --> 46:30.800
How about that?

46:30.800 --> 46:32.800
How about that?

46:32.800 --> 46:33.800
Vognetwork.com.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.440
All right.

46:35.440 --> 46:36.440
Anyway.

46:36.440 --> 46:37.440
All right.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.440
All right.

46:39.280 --> 46:47.560
We had a new game shown from Capcom called Path of the Goddess, which is definitely a

46:47.560 --> 46:51.240
unique looking game.

46:51.240 --> 46:52.240
Let's see what else.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.200
Oh, Forza Motorsports coming out this October.

46:54.200 --> 46:57.640
It's been a while.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.540
Which we kind of knew it was coming, but no.

46:59.540 --> 47:04.600
Another game that they've been hyping a little long, but at least it's this holiday finally.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.240
And I do love Forza Horizon.

47:07.240 --> 47:11.960
I wish I was better at the more sim game than the arcade-y game, but I understand there's

47:11.960 --> 47:15.960
a clear difference in the franchise, and this is the one that I enjoy less.

47:15.960 --> 47:19.520
But there are some people that enjoy them far more, and it does look beautiful, I'll

47:19.520 --> 47:20.520
say that.

47:20.520 --> 47:23.520
Again, I know I just said I think Flight Sim is probably the best looking video game out

47:23.520 --> 47:26.640
there, but Forza, not bad.

47:26.640 --> 47:27.880
Not bad by any means.

47:27.880 --> 47:28.880
Looked very good.

47:28.880 --> 47:29.880
Yep.

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
What else?

47:30.880 --> 47:31.880
Let's see.

47:31.880 --> 47:39.120
The Yellow Scrolls Online, they have a new expansion coming out called Necrom, which

47:39.120 --> 47:40.320
looked interesting.

47:40.320 --> 47:45.000
That's coming out June 20th.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.880
So this was funny.

47:47.880 --> 47:53.400
So I guess this is a trailer kind of a walk back a little bit of the whole Overwatch 2

47:53.400 --> 47:54.400
PvE thing.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.400
Oh, boy, was this a 180.

47:57.400 --> 47:58.840
Holy smokes.

47:58.840 --> 48:02.960
So they had a trailer for that.

48:02.960 --> 48:07.720
That's going to be, I guess, starting, it's coming out in August now.

48:07.720 --> 48:09.080
So that's interesting.

48:09.080 --> 48:13.840
Well, so there's some yes ands with that is that obviously there was this full skill tree

48:13.840 --> 48:18.280
system and all this other stuff that they were talking about with Overwatch 2 originally

48:18.280 --> 48:20.800
that is not going to be there and that this didn't change.

48:20.800 --> 48:26.200
And obviously they couldn't have 180'd on the content that fast, but they clearly 180'd

48:26.200 --> 48:27.200
on the messaging.

48:27.200 --> 48:33.920
This, by the way, is another reason why as much as I don't like big fish eating big fish

48:33.920 --> 48:39.500
in this industry, I absolutely support the Microsoft Activision Blizzard merger is because

48:39.500 --> 48:45.560
I feel like Microsoft fixed their fuck up with this and the PvE stuff.

48:45.560 --> 48:50.680
I mean, this trailer that they put out was some really good saving face.

48:50.680 --> 48:55.240
And a lot of people I know that played Overwatch responded very well to what was in that trailer.

48:55.280 --> 48:57.800
And they did show a variety of content.

48:57.800 --> 49:02.400
Even I was kind of like, oh, all this is going to be in the game?

49:02.400 --> 49:03.400
Okay.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.680
Like maybe I do need to reinstall it.

49:05.680 --> 49:07.440
Like they even got me.

49:07.440 --> 49:13.040
So kudos to Microsoft for helping them to 180 that messaging real quick.

49:13.040 --> 49:17.240
But I do think, I don't think the PvE is quite as robust as people were going to be hoping

49:17.240 --> 49:23.720
for, but it's just nice to see them acknowledge, highlight and show that there is going to

49:23.720 --> 49:28.640
be space for PvE in Overwatch, which was a key component of that trailer.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.400
So yeah, good for them.

49:31.400 --> 49:36.680
Mike Defton chat says they're finally releasing Overwatch 2 and it's just J100Matt says this.

49:36.680 --> 49:37.680
Yeah.

49:37.680 --> 49:41.920
Again, why I think the Microsoft merger is honestly good news.

49:41.920 --> 49:46.360
Also, I just want to backtrack and read a couple of comments on that Capcom title.

49:46.360 --> 49:49.600
Dr. C said, disappointed that it wasn't on Amusha.

49:49.600 --> 49:53.320
It looked like it thematically and quest buster says, I thought so too.

49:53.320 --> 49:54.320
Yeah.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.320
Yeah.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.320
I did kind of look that for a minute.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.320
So.

49:57.320 --> 49:58.320
Okay.

49:58.320 --> 50:02.800
Persona mastery is coming November 17th.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.680
So got a trailer for that.

50:04.680 --> 50:13.520
Lots of like Atlas games being shown for sure because we also got metaphor re Fantasio,

50:13.520 --> 50:16.040
which is a brand new RPG from Atlas as well.

50:16.040 --> 50:17.040
They showed that.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.440
I felt like there were more Japanese developed games in the showcase that we've seen in a

50:20.440 --> 50:21.600
very long time.

50:21.600 --> 50:22.600
Yeah.

50:22.600 --> 50:28.080
I noticed that quite a bit without them pointing it out, which is also impressive.

50:28.080 --> 50:33.200
I felt like there was a much more, you know, for all the lol Microsoft in Japan stuff we

50:33.200 --> 50:38.160
usually see there really was a lot of Japanese developed stuff relatively compared to other

50:38.160 --> 50:42.720
Xbox shows in this particular showcase without them pointing it out.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.160
I just thought that was interesting.

50:44.160 --> 50:45.160
Yeah.

50:45.160 --> 50:52.120
Then we also got, was it, so they did a trailer for Starfield prior to the Starfield direct,

50:52.120 --> 50:56.240
which was obviously the big main thing at after the event was done.

50:56.240 --> 51:05.000
But we got a new trailer for that just sent, which is a new game, I guess, by the life

51:05.000 --> 51:07.040
of strange developers.

51:07.040 --> 51:14.920
And it's like a climbing game, which is it was different, but it looked interesting.

51:14.920 --> 51:21.960
Another one, which is also kind of a crazy looking was Still Wakes the Deep, which was

51:21.960 --> 51:26.000
like a horror game almost taking place on it, like an oil rig.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.520
Was that the one from the Chinese room?

51:27.520 --> 51:29.640
Yeah, it is from the Chinese room.

51:29.640 --> 51:30.640
Okay.

51:30.640 --> 51:31.640
Yeah.

51:31.640 --> 51:35.760
I thought the Chinese room like literally like laid off their entire staff like four

51:35.760 --> 51:37.160
or five years ago.

51:37.160 --> 51:39.720
Like how are we getting something new from the Chinese room?

51:39.720 --> 51:42.400
That's and is it, it's not even going to be the same people.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.400
I don't know.

51:43.840 --> 51:47.600
The Chinese room made one of my very favorite narrative games ever, which is Everybody's

51:47.600 --> 51:48.640
Gone to the Rapture.

51:48.640 --> 51:51.440
And that's why when I see their logo, I fucking pay attention.

51:51.440 --> 51:56.520
But there's a part of me that's like, well, is it going to be like that?

51:56.520 --> 52:01.440
Because like, usually that logo enough would sell me on a game knowing it was the same

52:01.440 --> 52:02.440
creative team.

52:02.440 --> 52:06.560
But it's like, what maybe the studio head is the same and that's it.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.200
So I don't know how to feel about it.

52:08.200 --> 52:11.480
I need to see a little more to see if it's a narrative heavy game or what.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.800
Oh, and the music, wasn't it?

52:14.800 --> 52:18.120
I could be wrong, but I want to say it was the studio head's wife that did the music

52:18.120 --> 52:19.120
for that game.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.240
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

52:20.240 --> 52:27.160
So if, if that's the case for this game, like again, the music would be awesome.

52:27.160 --> 52:32.040
So yeah, just as Joe 100 Matt says 2017, they laid off their staff.

52:32.040 --> 52:35.360
That's what I thought because I was I remember thinking at the time, Oh, bummer.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.640
I really liked that game.

52:36.640 --> 52:38.320
And now we're not going to get anything else from them.

52:38.320 --> 52:41.400
And whoops, here we are.

52:41.400 --> 52:42.880
So interesting.

52:42.880 --> 52:43.880
Yeah.

52:43.880 --> 52:49.000
Um, Dungeons of Hinterberg, which was kind of an adventure games.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.920
They did like a cel shaded sword fighting adventure game.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.080
They have like a hoverboard type thing in there, which looked kind of cool.

52:56.080 --> 53:00.120
I'm down for more like adventure games.

53:00.120 --> 53:06.600
There was a big deal with Kiana Reeves coming out to talk about the Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom

53:06.600 --> 53:14.680
Liberty trailer, which it's content coming out in September.

53:14.680 --> 53:17.920
And of course, it also has Idris Elba in it.

53:17.920 --> 53:24.520
And I guess you're saving the future president of something, the United States, maybe.

53:24.520 --> 53:28.520
So that'll be pretty cool looking.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.520
What else?

53:29.520 --> 53:35.680
Let's see, Tower Born, which was a game by the creators of the Banner Saga look pretty

53:35.680 --> 53:36.680
cool.

53:36.680 --> 53:39.760
I really liked that big tower with the windmill thing on top of it.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.080
That looked really cool, kind of stylized.

53:42.080 --> 53:46.840
And then of course, the one they ended with reminded me the most of Bioshock Infinite,

53:46.840 --> 53:48.720
but Clockwork Revolution.

53:48.720 --> 53:54.440
It's a time bending steampunk RPG that certainly feels like Bioshock Infinite.

53:54.440 --> 53:58.040
Yeah, I thought it was a Bioshock announcement at first too, but then I was like, this isn't

53:58.040 --> 53:59.560
really like stylistic.

53:59.560 --> 54:02.880
It looks like Infinite, but it doesn't look like it at all.

54:02.880 --> 54:06.720
It's the developers that did Wasteland and Arcanium.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.640
So it's, I mean, I'm down for it.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.120
It looks cool.

54:11.120 --> 54:18.060
And then they announced one terabyte black Xbox Series S is coming for $349 in case you

54:18.060 --> 54:25.680
wanted an S, but you wanted more space to fit, you know, a few copies of Flight Sim

54:25.680 --> 54:26.680
or something like that.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.680
Yeah.

54:27.680 --> 54:30.440
I want to correct myself minorly on one thing I brought up earlier.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.120
So I was talking about Jessica Curry is her name, and she was the composer of Everybody's

54:34.120 --> 54:35.200
Gone to the Rapture.

54:35.200 --> 54:42.120
And yes, she was the wife of Dan Pinchbeck, who was part of Dear Esther.

54:42.120 --> 54:43.200
He made that game.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.880
And then they went on to form, I guess, the Chinese Room at that point.

54:46.880 --> 54:50.000
But it's also important to point out she wasn't just a composer of Everybody's Gone to the

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
Rapture.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
She was the director.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
That's an important clarification.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.120
So she had a much bigger hand in that game than just the music.

54:56.120 --> 55:03.400
And though nothing about what's happening with her current status with the Chinese Room,

55:03.400 --> 55:09.320
because I believe, I'm sorry, I'm trying to do some research live as we're looking at

55:09.320 --> 55:10.320
this.

55:10.320 --> 55:15.760
It does appear that Pinchbeck still is a creative director for the Chinese Room.

55:15.760 --> 55:20.320
And Curry is an independent composer for the studio.

55:20.320 --> 55:22.400
So maybe she will be doing the music.

55:22.400 --> 55:23.400
Who knows?

55:23.400 --> 55:24.400
Could be very interesting.

55:24.400 --> 55:28.880
All right, anyway, more to come on that.

55:28.880 --> 55:29.880
Yeah.

55:29.880 --> 55:33.920
Starfield looks amazing.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.160
I hope it doesn't.

55:35.160 --> 55:36.160
Please don't suck.

55:36.160 --> 55:39.800
I mean, it looks amazing, but please don't suck.

55:39.800 --> 55:43.320
It's based off of all the stuff that they talked about.

55:43.320 --> 55:46.460
So thousands of different planets you can go on.

55:46.460 --> 55:49.040
It's basically like a no man's sky.

55:49.040 --> 55:54.000
You can create your own ships, you can have crew on your ships, you can actually go inside.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.040
I think that's a little bit different than no man's sky.

55:56.040 --> 55:58.720
No, you know what it sounded like to me?

55:58.720 --> 56:02.360
The original vision for Mass Effect Andromeda is what it sounded like to me.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.360
Remember?

56:03.360 --> 56:06.360
Because Andromeda was supposed to be like lots more planets that were supposed to have

56:06.360 --> 56:08.560
more generated stuff with RPG elements.

56:08.560 --> 56:12.500
And then they kind of had the Frostbite engine wouldn't let them do it basically.

56:12.500 --> 56:16.040
So they had to change it into what it was, which they got some flack for doing.

56:16.040 --> 56:19.660
So yeah, definitely in hearing about that, I was like, this is basically what Andromeda

56:19.660 --> 56:21.380
was supposed to be.

56:21.380 --> 56:22.640
This is very interesting to me.

56:23.120 --> 56:26.880
I will say, I turned off the Starfield Direct halfway through, but not for the reason you

56:26.880 --> 56:27.880
think.

56:27.880 --> 56:30.200
I turned it off halfway through because I was convinced.

56:30.200 --> 56:35.220
I was like, all right, and you all know, I don't like to overhype things.

56:35.220 --> 56:38.240
And so halfway through, I was like, all right, I'm convinced.

56:38.240 --> 56:39.400
It's on Game Pass anyway.

56:39.400 --> 56:40.400
I'm downloading it.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.400
I'll check it out.

56:41.400 --> 56:45.140
I don't need to hear every nook and cranny about the game, you know, and why this city

56:45.140 --> 56:46.560
is beautiful.

56:46.560 --> 56:50.480
And they put 5,000 side quests in there and this is so expansive.

56:50.960 --> 56:52.760
At that point, I was like, all right, I've heard enough.

56:52.760 --> 56:53.760
I'm fine.

56:53.760 --> 56:54.760
Like, stop.

56:54.760 --> 56:55.760
I'm buying.

56:55.760 --> 56:56.760
It's fine.

56:56.760 --> 56:57.760
You're good.

56:57.760 --> 56:58.760
So that's why I turned it off.

56:58.760 --> 57:02.800
I just was like, hype train has pulled into the station.

57:02.800 --> 57:03.880
We're good.

57:03.880 --> 57:06.120
So I'll be checking that out for sure when it releases.

57:06.120 --> 57:10.120
I'm not going to splurge the money for the five day early release because, you know,

57:10.120 --> 57:14.280
they're trying to do extra things to lure you in addition to Game Pass and that stuff.

57:14.280 --> 57:17.040
But nah, the Game Pass one is fine for me.

57:17.040 --> 57:22.280
If I find it's worth spending extra money on, I'll do it outside of the game.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.320
So yeah.

57:24.320 --> 57:28.200
Questbuster in chat says, Starfield looks good, but I also zoned out in the middle of

57:28.200 --> 57:30.800
the presentation because I already got what I wanted to.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
I'm fine.

57:31.800 --> 57:32.800
Thanks.

57:32.800 --> 57:33.800
No, I don't need a membership card.

57:33.800 --> 57:34.880
Yeah, exactly that.

57:34.880 --> 57:37.600
As Jonathan and Matt says, you don't need to sell me on the timeshare.

57:37.600 --> 57:38.600
I'm buying.

57:38.600 --> 57:39.600
Yep.

57:39.600 --> 57:40.600
Oh, Bobby Blackwolf.

57:40.600 --> 57:41.600
Great point.

57:41.600 --> 57:42.860
You'll be at Dragon Con during the early release days.

57:42.860 --> 57:45.400
That's right, because it releases on September 6.

57:45.400 --> 57:50.560
And this game is literally Club 96 because it's releasing on September 6.

57:50.560 --> 57:51.560
So exactly.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.560
Yeah.

57:52.560 --> 57:53.560
I'll be at Dragon Con for early access anyway.

57:53.560 --> 57:55.480
That's what I have to worry about with this.

57:55.480 --> 58:01.960
So like a game like Skyrim, you can play for like thousands of hours and that's one world.

58:01.960 --> 58:07.200
Is this just going to be the game that I end up having to play the rest of my life?

58:07.200 --> 58:13.600
I wonder if the, I wonder if the planets are a little more confined.

58:13.600 --> 58:18.240
Like there's artificial ways they wall them in or something that they didn't really show.

58:18.240 --> 58:22.520
Like mountains you can't scale or something like the, you know, you, you just never have

58:22.520 --> 58:23.520
the right equipment to do.

58:23.520 --> 58:24.520
I don't know.

58:24.520 --> 58:29.920
Again, I'm, you know, maybe I'm saying too much or whatever, but it just seems like maybe

58:29.920 --> 58:30.920
there's some ways.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.680
Or yeah, if they're just using AI to randomly generate shit all the way to, or machine learning,

58:34.680 --> 58:38.640
whatever you want to call it, between things, then okay, so it's a bunch of nothing between

58:38.640 --> 58:41.720
all these areas, which could end up being its own problem too.

58:41.720 --> 58:47.880
But I, I think it'll be good enough and vast and exploring enough.

58:47.880 --> 58:49.800
And do you want to play it the rest of your life?

58:49.800 --> 58:50.800
Maybe.

58:50.800 --> 58:51.800
Okay.

58:51.800 --> 58:52.800
Yeah.

58:52.800 --> 58:55.560
Bobby Blackwell says it is procedurally generated with handcrafted elements.

58:55.560 --> 58:57.200
So interesting.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.800
I mean, it looks, looks interesting.

59:00.800 --> 59:01.840
I definitely want to check it out.

59:01.840 --> 59:03.620
I mean, yeah.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.620
Bring it on.

59:04.620 --> 59:05.620
I'm excited.

59:05.620 --> 59:09.680
Again, this is one of the things where it's because it's game pass, it's like, okay, yeah,

59:09.680 --> 59:13.400
I'll keep my game pass subscription active and I will download this on September 6th.

59:13.400 --> 59:14.400
Done.

59:14.400 --> 59:15.400
We're good.

59:15.400 --> 59:16.940
I don't need to hear anymore.

59:16.940 --> 59:19.840
So character creator looked really good too.

59:19.840 --> 59:20.840
Yes.

59:20.840 --> 59:22.920
Very like tons of things you can do with that.

59:22.920 --> 59:26.880
Although our old pal Travis Donovan from a show called Understation Live that was here

59:26.880 --> 59:30.520
on VOG for quite some time before it sunsetted, he made a very good point.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.400
He said with everything going on, and I'm paraphrasing his tweets, I don't have it in

59:33.400 --> 59:37.740
front of me, but he was like, with everything going on, you know, in video games and technology

59:37.740 --> 59:43.100
these days, it is so wild that I can't just take a selfie and upload it into the character

59:43.100 --> 59:47.520
creator and have it generate something that's basically close enough.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.180
They have that in some games.

59:49.180 --> 59:50.180
It's just not this one.

59:50.180 --> 59:52.620
The Nintendo me thing did that if I remember right.

59:52.620 --> 59:55.020
Do you think you could do that with your 3DS?

59:55.020 --> 59:56.020
Couldn't you?

59:56.020 --> 59:59.380
Well, yeah, yeah, you could, but like NBA 2K, I think does that.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.860
Oh yeah, it does.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.460
I know NBA 2K does that.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.460
There's other games that also have those where you can map things because people put their

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.600
babies and dogs and all sorts of weird stuff.

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.660
But yeah, this, the only thing that I saw that's kind of catering to you is that they

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.780
said that the robot will say your name like they did in Fallout 4.

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.780
So cool.

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.500
I mean, I don't know.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.180
I don't really need it to, you know, exactly look like me.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:31.220
Well, Rob isn't exactly a hard name either, so maybe I need to give myself a more clever

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.220
name.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.940
I'll name myself after one of the animals like I often do in video games.

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.020
So I'll go by Mr. Smoosh.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:40.740
So the robot has to call me that or like Nostradamus or something.

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:41.740
See?

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:42.740
Yeah.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:46.380
All right.

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.740
Anything else on the Xbox event?

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:52.540
No, I mean, that was pretty much the major announcements that they had.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.540
How'd you feel?

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.260
I liked the Starfield controller.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.900
I thought that looked pretty cool.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.900
I did.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.620
I liked that too, actually.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620
Yeah.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.740
And they had headphones too.

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:05.260
I didn't really get a good look at the headphones.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.580
The collector's edition watch.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.580
That's neat.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.820
Not going to buy it, but that's neat.

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:13.460
I mean, that they have a watch.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:18.020
It would have been cooler if it like tied in with the game, like using like a cell phone

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.020
or something like that.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:22.420
Although it says you can read your notifications and stuff on your cell phone on the watch,

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.620
which is neat.

01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:28.420
But yeah, if it like tied into the game or something like that, it would be pretty cool.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:29.420
Neat.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.420
All right.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.900
Overall, you feel pretty good about that?

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:33.900
Yeah, it was positive.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:34.900
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:41.860
I mean, I think the best way, like, what was it, like to quote Skill Up, they said, you

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:47.260
know, I judge a presentation like that based off of how many games I'm excited to play.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.800
And I think that this had a lot of games I'm excited to play in it.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.980
So I would say it's pretty positive in my opinion.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:54.980
Yeah.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:02:02.580
I think Game Pass changes the way you evaluate a lot of stuff in that showcase.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:08.220
And again, as has been the case for several years now, these showcases are wonderful advertisements

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.220
for Game Pass.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:12.380
And I feel that that was pretty much the same theme this year.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.460
All right.

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:16.880
Well, let's move on.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.220
And you know, an hour into the show, let's finally talk about our gaming weeks.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.940
Hey, we knew it would be that kind of week this week, though, with all the announcements.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:26.620
Let's talk about the types of games we have been playing this week, though, while we anticipate

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.220
all this other upcoming stuff.

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:31.940
I need to step away real quick, but I'll start by throwing it to Jamie and ask, how was your

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.820
gaming week?

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:37.500
It was all right.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.220
I played Black Knight 2000.

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:44.860
I'm sorry, Black Knight Sword of Rage, which we have now, and it's really awesome.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:52.900
And I played some Turtles and I played some World Cup Soccer for my pinball gaming.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.980
And then, of course, I played Dead by Daylight.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:08.860
I've also played Marvel's Midnight Suns, I've played Cult of the Lamb, and I'm actually

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.020
branching out.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:14.020
I'm trying to look at a couple other things that I just want to play in my downtime.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:17.420
So kind of thinking about starting something new.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.420
We'll see.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.420
That's it.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.420
OK.

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.820
I played Minecraft.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.220
Surprise.

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.100
It's the same thing.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:28.940
Don't play in stuff.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:34.620
I've designed two of the Robot Master areas because I'm going to try to cram two in one

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.940
episode, which is ridiculous, but I've got them designed.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.820
I've got one I've already started building.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.860
The other one will probably finish later this week.

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:48.980
I'm hoping to get an episode out in the middle of the week because this is the pace I have

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:54.940
to keep in order to finish on time, to finish everything I wanted, because originally the

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:59.620
season we were planning on going to the end of the year, but then we decided to change

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:01.860
that now so it's not the whole year.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:07.860
And so because I could have scaled down the scope of my projects, but instead I decided

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.860
to double up on how quickly I get them done.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:18.900
So that's not entirely healthy, but it is what I'm doing and it is coming along.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.180
It is pretty fun.

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:26.340
So lots of stuff very soon.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.340
Lots of builds.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.340
Very, very cool.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.860
I've been checking in from time to time.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860
Thank you.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.860
Appreciate it.

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.860
And I can tell you that Dan followed you too.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:41.820
Oh, thank you.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:42.820
All right.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:48.940
Well, then I can hop into my gaming week, which was primarily Diablo 4 because I was

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:50.220
talking about it a little bit last week.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.660
I know, shock and awe.

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:56.220
But I've been feeling a lot better this week.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:57.780
I was sick last weekend.

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:00.540
If you listen to last week's show, I've been feeling a lot better as the days have gone

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.540
by.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:04.700
I still have a little bit of residual, but for the most part now it's Alan.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.940
Alan finally got sick.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.340
He finally caught whatever I had like on Wednesday.

01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:14.280
I think what ultimately happened, I had strep throat and a sinus cold at the same time.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.380
Like legitimately that's what happened because Alan only caught the sinus cold part.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.240
He didn't catch the strep throat.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.740
So interesting.

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.180
Well, strep is bacterial.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.180
Yeah.

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:27.460
So he would have had, I guess.

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:31.500
But we knew at a certain point like not to touch each other and sleep in different beds.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.100
So like we kind of knew early on said strep, but I think the sinus thing was harder to

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.100
prevent for whatever reason.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.300
It doesn't necessarily help with bacteria.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.980
That's more of a viral precaution, but yeah.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.380
You know, you do what you can.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.380
All right.

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.980
But anyway, point is I'm feeling a lot better and I was able to really put some hours into

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.020
Diablo 4 this week and I beat the main campaign.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.020
Yay.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.220
Um, and uh, I'm in the end game stuff now.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.500
I'm only level 50.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.940
I kind of timed it really good.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:01.300
I beat the game around level 48 so I've been doing end game stuff up to level 50 and I

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:05.900
just before tonight's show, I beat the capstone dungeon to get me into world tier three where

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.300
some more stuff unlocks.

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.100
Um, so that's pretty cool.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:14.260
I will say as far as the game itself goes in the story, I was, it's, it's great.

01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.820
Like and you know, I know I've been hyping this game up a lot, but like the story was

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.660
really well done.

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:20.900
It has its faults.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:23.940
There were a couple things about the end of the game that really annoyed the piss out

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:24.940
of me.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:25.940
Like narrative wise.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:31.160
Um, I kind of think one of the, all right, I'm gonna watch my words carefully.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:35.560
Not everybody's beaten it yet, so I'm going to just, I'm going to hold my criticisms out

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.680
of respect for those that are still working their way through.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.040
But in six weeks when season one starts, I'm not going to promise the same was straight.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.040
So all of you into Diablo better hurry up.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.240
Um, but um, I will say those complaints are relatively minor.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:55.280
I do think the good news about the game and the story wise is that Lilith was an incredible

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:01.600
antagonist and I'm really pleased that they juggled new characters, obviously cause at

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.400
the time, you know, this is past, well past Diablo three, they had to incorporate a lot

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.500
of new characters with some of the classics.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:14.960
But like Diablo himself is not really a main character in this game at all.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:23.000
He's there, he's mentioned, he relates to Lilith, um, because you know, basically Diablo

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
is Lilith's uncle.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
That's not a spoiler.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.120
If you, if you read up on the game, you kind of know how Lilith relates to everything in

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.960
Diablo lore and so forth.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:37.680
But, but it is very clear Diablo will play into an expansion and it is very clear there

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:44.000
will be story expansions and it, because to me they very clearly teased a new class in

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
the game.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.520
Like there are NPC, major NPCs that are, I think a class that was in Diablo three that

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.960
is not Diablo four, uh, which will be very exciting when that shows up.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.600
Uh, and uh, yeah, just left it very open ended, but I'm, I'm okay.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:04.680
I mean, like again, I thought the six acts that they gave you were really well done story

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.640
and uh, very, uh, yeah, very comprehensive.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:11.680
Uh, Questbuster says, I only just started the story a day or two in Diablo four.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.220
I spent most of my time just exploring and building my sorceress.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.640
The world is so huge.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.720
I, yeah, I mean, that's how I started too, but let me give you a friendly piece of advice.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.600
Don't overdo it with staying in one zone.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.240
It can be a dragon age origins, hinterlands kind of thing.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:34.960
You really need to force yourself to leave the zone once you unlock that second skill

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:35.960
point.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.600
And my reason for that is the other stuff you unlock by doing more things in the zone

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.740
are gated behind world tier three.

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.440
So you're working like the more, the Paragon points and the obols, you can't get those

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:52.960
until you're in world tier three, which you can't do until you beat the game.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.520
So look, I'm all for side questing and I'm not going to tell you not to side quest.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:09:01.360
That would be foolish, but I will say you're, you're, you're going to be working towards

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.640
things you can't even unlock once you get that second skill point in an area.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.200
So you get skill point potion upgrade, which is very helpful too.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.160
And then another skill point, once you unlock that second skill point, force yourself to

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160
move on.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.660
You'll be doing yourself a favor.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.860
Once you get through the main story, you get a mount towards the end of the story, which

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:22.960
helps greatly with the exploration.

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.460
You'll be thanking yourself.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.620
So yeah, I know, I know it goes against everything I want to do in a game normally too, but you

01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:30.740
really have to force yourself to move on.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:34.340
So all right.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.100
Questmaster says you can get Paragon points.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.820
They just take a super long time because I'm still on tier two.

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:44.400
Yes, but you can actually get a four Paragon point bonus for getting a certain reputation

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.400
in the zone.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.480
That's very high, but only on world tier three.

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:54.680
So all right, Pop Culture says I'm playing on Black Wolf mode and I'm still struggling.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.360
Make sure you are evaluating your gear.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.100
Don't be afraid to do some upgrades, especially on your weapon.

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.600
And remember death really doesn't have a penalty outside of durability, which is a nothing

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.600
factor anyway.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.020
You get the gold to make up for that by killing one pack of mobs.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.440
So take it at your own pace.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.440
It's fine.

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:15.840
I beat the game on world tier one.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.440
I didn't move to world tier two until I beat the game.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:23.380
So you are, and I got to like 48 with all the side quests I did.

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.980
So don't feel like you're going to get a subpar experience just because you're not able to

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.260
go past world tier one for whatever reason.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.280
So but yeah, Diablo four, I think it's great.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.560
I can't wait to experience more of the end game and playing with friends too, because

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.780
I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, all right, I'm sick of doing all these dungeons

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:40.780
by myself.

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:44.300
I want to do team up and do some of this harder stuff would be a little more fun.

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.820
So hoping to do some of that in the next week.

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:47.820
All right.

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:48.820
That was my gaming week.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:52.620
I mean, I played a little 14, a little dead by daylight, but let's be real.

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.100
Most of it was Diablo four.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.140
All right.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:59.860
Let's go on to some more gaming news, more expos.

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:03.420
But this, you know what, Loki, I felt like, I felt like this one didn't, this one didn't

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:05.500
deserve a headline spot tonight.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.100
Well, it's, it's, it's, it never does.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:13.420
It's the PC gaming show and it's usually pretty lame as it is.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:18.700
But they tried to go the whole, and this is where like I fault them, especially because

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:24.100
they tried to go the Devolver digital route and they failed horribly at it.

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.820
Like it was just cringy.

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.500
The hosts were very cringy.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.500
Please don't do that.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.500
Just show the trailers.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.500
That's all you got to do.

01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:34.060
You don't even have to have the hosts.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.980
They don't serve any purpose other than wasting everybody's time.

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.940
But there's lots of different things that they did show.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:46.420
I'm going to try to go down through some of these that I recognize that look pretty cool.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:50.840
So let's see, and this is based off of like when it's actually going to be released here.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:56.120
So we had a vampire survivors update 1.5 is coming out actually tomorrow.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.180
So that looked pretty cool.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:02.500
Teardown is getting a creative mode, which teardown, if you're not familiar, is that

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:07.460
voxel kind of heist game, but now you can build with voxels and stuff and do crazy things

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:08.460
with them.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.780
So that looked pretty cool.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:13.700
A game called Miasma Chronicles.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.180
That's going to be coming out on the 20th and it looked pretty sweet.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:22.220
Parked Beyond, that Bandai Namco game, it's a park sim that's going to be coming out here

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.220
this week.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.900
What other cool things, 3DXX.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:27.900
I get it.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.760
3DXX is supposed to be kind of like a Mega Man game, but those those main characters

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.500
are like goddamn like wish.com Mega Man.

01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:39.980
I mean, like it's it's a little too close for my comfort, to be honest.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.980
I didn't.

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.920
Is this a sequel to 20 XCX?

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.920
I think it is.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920
Yes.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.640
So that's coming out in August 9th.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:53.700
Path of Exile 2, the showcase July 28th for that.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:59.940
There's a lot of what was the other one here that in vector rhythm galaxy, I think would

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:04.840
be one you want to check out a new rhythm game that's coming out July 14th.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.600
That's the Avicii one.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.600
But now with.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.600
Yes.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:09.600
Yeah.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.380
With just a rotation of electro songs at this point.

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.380
Yeah.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.380
Yeah.

01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.380
That Avicii game was pretty good, actually.

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.380
It was a good tribute.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.380
Yeah.

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:23.820
We had a Frostpunk 2 announced, so it's coming out next year.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.660
Parcel Court looked pretty sweet.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.300
It's a you're a bike courier and it's like lots of like jumping off walls and stuff like

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:31.300
that, which is cool.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:39.880
Mullet Magic, which is a 90s anime like roguelike game that's kind of a one of those retro FPS

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.280
games done like the style of Duke Nukem or something like that, that's going to be coming

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280
out at some point.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.680
It looked pretty sweet.

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:53.940
XO one, the developers that made that kind of I don't know what you kind of call it.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:14:00.400
It's more of like a planetary exploration, kind of like a it's not an action game, but

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.460
it's like a you traverse like different planet landscapes and now they have XO Rally Championship

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:09.380
where you're in this kind of buggy that you have to control kind of through those same

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:12.200
type of landscapes, but looks a little bit more challenging.

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.980
So that's something that got announced as well.

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:23.920
There was one that I saw that looked just like Animal Crossing Critter Cove was an Animal

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:27.860
Crossing type game that's going to be coming out here at some point.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.900
Mariachi Legends looked pretty sweet.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:38.600
It's kind of a almost like Spanish mythos like Metroidvania type game.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.540
So that looked pretty cool.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:48.980
Stampede Racing Royale is the horrible amalgamation of a battle royale game and Mario Kart, and

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:53.600
it looked like too many players on like a track at the same time, but it's your usual

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.920
like kart game.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.000
The Invincible looked pretty cool.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.060
I'm trying to see what else.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.060
Lords of the Fallen, I think, is being remade.

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:07.980
Oh, yeah, somebody somebody showed me a clip of that.

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:08.980
Yeah, they are.

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:14.900
It's like a it's not really a remake, but it's like a re reinterpretation or something.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:15.900
Yeah, I guess.

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.820
Yeah, I don't even know if I called it that, but yeah.

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:24.620
Sand, which is a kind of like a steampunk game set in deserts, looked pretty cool.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.160
They they they teased it before the like event, they're like, the full trailer is coming during

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.160
this.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:37.320
They kept it to the end and the trailer was just like 30 seconds of like a cinematic.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:43.240
It showed nothing of what the game is about, and it's it just sucked the whole the whole

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.240
thing sucks.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.240
Okay.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.240
Like the games are cool.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:47.240
Yeah.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:48.240
That's like some games.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.240
Yeah, the games are awesome.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:54.340
But like, oh, another one, Dwarf is another game that they showed that reminded me of

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:58.080
old school Command and Conquer, which I am totally down for.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.280
So that looked cool.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.800
And then the most random thing ever, another Castlevania or Metroidvania style game starring

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.720
Ebenezer Scrooge and Ebenezer and the Invisible World.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:11.120
Okay, sure.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:15.560
This is what happens when classics go into the public domain.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560
Sure.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560
Why not?

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.920
I mean, every let everybody have a Metroidvania game.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:21.920
That's fine.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:22.920
Yeah.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920
But yeah, lots.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:28.540
You know what, though, I it's it's quirky enough to sound actually kind of interesting,

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:29.540
to be honest.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:30.740
Yeah, it's all right.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:35.620
They showed off a lot of different trailers for like, Hello Neighbor, there's so many

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:39.420
Hello Neighbors spin offs now, like I can't keep track of all of them.

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.900
I know one of them was like Hello Engineer.

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:46.620
And then they have like, I don't even know they have like several Hello Neighbor games.

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:51.500
Oh, and then another one that I remembered was My Friendly Neighborhood, which is, you

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.400
know, you've got your FNAF, which is a take on, you know, of course, Chuck E. Cheese and

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.880
stuff like that, you know, Showtime Pizza.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:03.540
Well, now you have your, well, let's make a FNAF type game, but it's with Sesame Street.

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.060
And so that's what My Friendly Neighborhood is.

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.280
You're fighting off Muppets.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.280
Oh, no.

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.600
Are Bert and Ernie in it?

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:17.720
Uh, they're, you know, legally distinct Bert and Ernie are in it.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.720
Okay, okay.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.180
Kurt and Mernie.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:27.060
Kurt and, yeah.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:30.440
All right.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.020
So it sounds like the PC gaming show just maybe needs to reevaluate the presentation

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.560
because the game trailers themselves are fine.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.340
It's just the presentation of it all is like, they need to do better.

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:44.200
I noticed they were partnering with Heka streamers, trying to get the streamers to like co-stream

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:48.920
and kind of build the hype that way because I have some influencer friends and like all

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.640
of them were mysteriously hyping up the PC gaming show.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:57.440
And I was like, y'all don't usually get excited about this kind of stuff.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.240
Like I know what's going on.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.700
Yeah, it's just, it was just cringe.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:06.020
Like the presenters were cringe, the trailers were good.

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.580
The presenters were cringe.

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.580
Just tone it down.

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:12.640
Like you're not going to be as funny as Devolver Digital.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:14.640
Get that out of your head.

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.920
You're just not going to, it's not going to happen.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:17.920
All right.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.680
We'll talk about Devolver Digital a little later in the show, but first we have some

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.720
more stories that don't involve showcases that are going on this week, but we have this

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.720
to talk about.

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720
Oh boy.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.720
All right.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.400
Get your popcorn because I got something to say about this.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.780
So Activision has removed a Call of Duty skin from sale.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.640
This skin was for a streamer community.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.720
The streamer's name is Nickmercs.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.440
I had not heard of this guy until this story came out, although apparently I'd already

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.520
blocked him on Twitter at some point, so this is clearly not the first thing he's done that

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.420
made me make a face.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.680
What is it that he did?

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:04.640
He made a comment on social media in response to a video that was shared by an esports caster,

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.760
Chris Puckett, and they were in the video.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:13.880
Some pro-LGBTQIA plus demonstrators were being attacked outside of a school in California,

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.280
and in the caption, Chris Puckett said, Americans are in a sad place right now.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.320
Let people love who they love and live your own life.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:26.120
I'm sorry, I'm getting angry just even having to read this.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:31.320
In a reply, Nickmercs said, they should leave little children alone.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.560
That's the real issue.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:41.640
And, of course, people went off on Twitter, as you might expect.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:47.060
Even the esports caster that wrote the original tweet put, who is they and what terrible act

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.520
is everyone afraid of?

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.960
I think, Hope, the goal of most of them is to reduce child suicides.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:58.640
This is done through acceptance and removing the stigma of feeling being different.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.360
As a dad, I'm struggling to see the harm.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.000
Gay doesn't equal pedo.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.420
Great response by Chris Puckett.

01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:07.420
Thank you very much.

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:09.520
You do not make me angry.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:16.920
Then Nickmercs goes on to stream and doesn't apologize for the tweet, but also denies having

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.920
anti-LGBT beliefs.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.880
I'm not going to play the clip because I'm not going to amplify this guy's views, because

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.820
as far as I'm concerned, that little fucky comment stands for itself.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:33.540
Not during Pride Month, you son of a bitch.

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:37.020
You are not going to make these types of fucking comments during Pride Month.

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:44.220
Thank God you lost your sponsorship, because some people don't deserve to be famous.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:48.500
The Kardashians deserve more fame than you do after a comment like that.

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:57.940
During Pride Month, I am sick and fucking tired of this gay equals pedophilia connotation.

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:02.060
I'll tell you who's molesting kids, and it's not drag queens.

01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.540
You can finish the rest of that sentence.

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.200
You want to go look on social media and the facts for yourself.

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:10.040
It's not drag queens doing it.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.500
You can figure out the other half of that.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.540
I don't need to spell it out for you.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:14.540
But I'm-

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:18.600
Yeah, they have that whole subreddit called Not a Drag Queen that-

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.260
I am sick and tired of this.

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:29.500
Alan, my husband and I just want to live our fucking lives with our cats and go to Target.

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.900
That is all we want.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:39.020
Not any of this shit about they should leave little children alone.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.720
Spoiler alert, I don't even really like kids.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.820
We don't plan on having our own.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:51.820
Now before my friends with children get offended, obviously, I like my friends' kids in small

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:52.860
doses.

01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.260
Loki, your children are fine.

01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.420
But you know what the great thing about your kids-

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.420
It's fine.

01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:00.180
I like my kids in small doses too.

01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:01.180
That's everybody's kids.

01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:02.180
Here's the great thing-

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.060
It was like I would say when I was babysitting Julian, I can give him back what I've done.

01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:07.060
That is it.

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.060
That is it.

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.060
That is the lovely thing.

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.060
That is it.

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:15.740
At some point there comes a day with, okay, this visit was lovely and now I'm going to

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:16.740
leave.

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:17.740
La la la la la.

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:18.740
That is the best part.

01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:19.740
That's the best part.

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:24.700
Now you get to take them.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:30.980
But this fucking viewpoint enrages me.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:35.620
This is not 2023 stuff.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:39.540
This alone should be enough to get a rat out of me.

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.620
But you know what's happening now?

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.660
It's going one step further.

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:51.220
Now all the pinheads are coming out and supporting this guy.

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:52.220
Like Tim the Tap Man.

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.500
Tim the Tap Man.

01:22:53.500 --> 01:23:00.560
I swear to God, I read Tim the Tam Tams when I read that at first, who apparently is also

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:05.820
a Call of Duty high profile streamer, 5 million YouTube subscribers and a billion views.

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.820
Called on-

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:08.380
Oh, don't we just have Tim Tams instead?

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.380
How about it?

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:14.020
Called on Activision to remove his bundle in support of my friend.

01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.580
Nick Merks has been my friend for years.

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.420
We went in getting our Call of Duty operations together.

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:23.020
It feels wrong for me to have mine and him no longer have his.

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:28.060
In support of my friend, please remove the Tim the Tap Man bundle at Call of Duty.

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:35.140
And then that 40 year old man who dresses up in a wig on stream that Dr. Disrespect

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:39.660
gets on there and dares to go say things like, I'm going to uninstall Call of Duty

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:40.660
on stream.

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:41.660
Excuse me.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:42.660
Who was-

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:43.660
Let's see.

01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:44.660
Again.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:45.660
What was-

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:46.660
I'm sorry.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:47.660
What was the tweet that pissed me off?

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:50.340
Nick Merks said they should leave little children alone.

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.340
What-

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.340
Remind me.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.140
Why was Dr. Disrespect banned from Twitch?

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.900
He's also banned from YouTube, I think.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:57.900
Oh yeah.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:04.240
He took a camera into a bathroom where underage people were at E3.

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:11.640
You dumb fucks are just showing your entire asses and not in the cool Ichiban kind of

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640
way.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:18.160
You are just showing why you deserve to have no followers.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:22.640
So as far as I'm concerned, you all can fuck off into the sun.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.720
And I hope Activision tells you as much.

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:30.380
And to be honest, I have never wanted to play Call of Duty more in my life.

01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:32.680
You need to give the props where props are due.

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.920
I understand.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.800
We've given Activision a lot of shit on this show over the years and rightfully so.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.760
Their CEO is still a master cock monger idiot.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.520
I cannot stand him.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.800
However, when it's right, it's right.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:53.120
And I will say good job Activision for what you're doing on this and props to you.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:58.040
And honestly, I want to play Call of Duty to support what you're doing.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.840
I do.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:05.320
I never thought those words would leave my mouth.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:12.600
But thank you for standing by and say that this language isn't fucking okay.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.400
And yeah, if this is the kind of shit that's going to leave your mouth, you deserve to

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.480
be deplatformed.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.320
I don't have a Call of Duty skin on the store.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.280
I'm not entitled to it.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.460
Neither are you.

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:36.940
So if you're going to conduct yourself like a massive twat, then good riddance.

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.800
Maybe you can start a GoFundMe or something and a bunch of dumb fucks can pay your bills

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800
or something.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.780
All your scummy little fans that are standing by you through all this.

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:53.520
Anyway, Djurama S points out that wasn't why he was removed from Twitch, but it should

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.520
have been.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.520
Yeah, probably.

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.280
I'm pretty sure he got a temp ban for that.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.400
It was all those temp bans that added up.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.120
But we're...he's...that guy...

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:12.680
Anyway, and if you're following these people, I really need you to evaluate.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:16.340
Because honestly, again, I want to make this very clear.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:18.260
They should leave little children alone.

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:19.360
That's the real issue.

01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.640
Who is they?

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.960
LGBT folks?

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.400
Because that's me.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.760
That's Dark Sakura.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.520
That's a lot of people in our audience that listen to this show.

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:37.000
You're okay with somebody saying that, insinuating, allowing that conclusion that we want to whatever

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.200
with kids?

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.940
You're okay with that?

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.120
Fuck out of here.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.600
I think I threw up in my mouth a little.

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.600
I did too.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.520
And this is...it's the whole thing is, again, if y'all are going to say, stop making stupid

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.640
people famous when talking about the Kardashians, then you need to mean it here too.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.080
Stop making these dumb fucks famous.

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.080
I was so happy.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.580
I mean, I'd heard of Dr. Disrespect, but only because of the other dumb things he's done

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:08.580
over the years.

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:13.120
But I hadn't heard of the Tam Tam guy or this other guy who I apparently had blocked already

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.960
on Twitter, probably over something else moronic that he'd said at some point.

01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:21.240
Not in my gaming community.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.240
Get the fuck out.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.480
I'm glad Activision showed him the door.

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.480
Anyway, I don't know what better transition...

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.360
One thing they did right?

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.680
Yeah, no, we have to give credit where credit is due.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:40.320
There are a lot of problems at Activision, 100%.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.200
This was the right decision.

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.040
This shows a culture of trying to change and do the right thing.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:52.120
This is movement in the right direction, and it must be called out and it must be backed

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.920
up and applauded.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:59.520
Anyway, I don't know how else to follow up this story, but I think a serial killer story

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520
sounds pretty good.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.240
So Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:09.000
Well, actually, my thing is starting off on the music composer.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.480
Oh, sure.

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:18.000
How many of y'all listening are familiar with Harry Manfredini?

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.360
I bet if I played the song, you'd know.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:26.200
Well, we can play it if we won't get, you know...

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.440
I shouldn't risk it, but you can hum it.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:29.440
All right.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:33.240
Well, no, just think kill, kill, kill, die, die, die.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.240
Anyway.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.240
There you go.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:48.000
So anyway, so Harry Manfredini is the composer for all the music in the Friday 13th series

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.760
and the games.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:58.080
And now the game itself, the game that's been out right now, their publisher, Gun Media,

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.560
announced that their license for Friday the 13th is going to expire and the game won't

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.920
be for sale after this year.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:12.520
So moving on, while that's been...

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:19.920
On one hand, there's already so many other things going like a Peacock TV series, but

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.120
another video game is in the works.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:30.920
And it was Manfredini who broke it by saying that he was doing the music for it.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:39.120
There was a Crystal Lake reunion event that was in New Jersey and he said that he was

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:44.640
working on music for another game that has yet to be officially announced and he can't

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.960
really say much about it.

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.280
I think he kind of let that going a bit more.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:53.120
But he did say the new game will feature more realistic looking characters and have different

01:29:53.120 --> 01:30:01.240
gameplay as compared to the previous asymmetrical experience.

01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:14.480
So there is a lot more projects involved in the whole Return to Crystal Lake series that's

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.960
going to be on...

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.840
Sorry, Crystal Lake series that's going to be on Peacock.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:26.680
But they're apparently going to have a lot more and it looks like the video game doesn't

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.680
have a release date clearly because all we had was this tease and the TV show doesn't

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.000
have a release date yet.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.160
So we'll have to keep our eyes on it.

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.000
Well, and now they have to let the old game sunset.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.200
I don't know if you heard that this week, but the current asymmetrical game...

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.920
That's what I said at the beginning of the article.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.800
Yeah, it's going to go, phew.

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:50.840
But it is interesting because this all lends itself to...

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:54.560
I think a lot of people jump to the conclusion that, oh, Jason's going to be in Dead by Daylight

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:59.800
because the original asymmetrical game is sunsetting, but not so fast.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.960
Well, I mean, why not both anyway?

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.960
I mean...

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.960
It could.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.960
We could text Chainsaw Massacre.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.960
We have Bubba.

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:07.960
Yeah.

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:08.960
Could happen.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:15.400
Although I really wish Bubba had gone because I hate him and I'm going to hate having to

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.240
adapt him.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.040
I have to think of how to make a non-threatening looking Bubba so that people just feel sorry

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.440
for me.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:25.920
He has that purple suit thing that's a little silly.

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.040
I haven't wear the suit in the Lunch Lady wig.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.040
There you go.

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.040
Yeah.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.320
But, um, yeah.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.600
So I'm, I liked the Friday the 13th game.

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.920
I think it's a shame what happened with all the legal fuckery with that game, because

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.920
that game kind of deserved a better ending than it got.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:48.920
And I see in our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, SheHulk10 says, good night to

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.720
the last Friday the 13th game.

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.680
It is awesome and should make us nervous about what we own digitally.

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.520
It'll be unplayable December 31st, 2024.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:57.520
Yeah.

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.760
Kind of sucks that the servers are going to be kaput.

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:04.440
But until then, you know, it was a great game for what it was.

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:09.120
It's a bummer that the legal issues just caused it to grind to a halt.

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:15.560
Speaking of scary games sunsetting on a tangent, I'm sure you heard about this Dark Sakura

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:19.080
Video Horse Society or VHS also announced this week.

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:25.480
It will be leaving as of, I think, October, September, October.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.080
I didn't hear about that.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.080
Oh yeah.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.080
Yeah.

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.080
VHS is done.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.520
It didn't do well?

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:32.520
Yeah.

01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:36.720
And they did not have the player base basically to substantiate, which is interesting.

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:40.200
That game had so much hype and then they pulled it offline.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:44.400
It was the exact same thing that happened to Hive social app.

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:48.880
Everybody jumped on it for a couple of weeks and then they pulled it offline for like months

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.880
and nobody went back.

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:54.240
Well, I shouldn't say nobody, but not enough people went back that were there the first

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.240
time.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:59.760
They just put out a whole bunch of new content and you know, a lot of people loved it.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:09.040
So I'll be honest, I hated the forced voice chat, I mean, but I mean, that's sad.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.040
Yeah.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:13.520
So that's another horror, asymmetrical horror game that's biting the dust.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:15.680
Rest of Pepperoni.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.680
Yeah.

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:17.840
RIP MPs.

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:22.040
I think you can still play it like, and they gave out a code to give you a ton of the cosmetics

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.640
and stuff, but yeah, it's, it's unfortunate.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.640
All right.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.240
Are they doing a full server shutdown or?

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:30.240
Yeah.

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:31.240
Full.

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.240
You won't be able to play it after a certain day.

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.240
So.

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.040
Well, then you know that there's going to be private servers popping up.

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:36.680
I'm sure they'll figure something out.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680
Yeah.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680
All right.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:41.000
Loki, I promised earlier we could talk a little more about this.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:42.400
You love this company, right?

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.400
Yeah.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:44.400
Devolver Digital.

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.020
They had their digital showcase, didn't show off a ton of games, but they had four games

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:52.080
that they showed off and they were all pretty good looking.

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:59.600
So we had Wizard with a Gun, which is an isometric survival game that's themed around fantasy

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.560
with the Western.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:06.680
And there's also, you build, you know, construct buildings and collect resources to survive

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.680
in the game.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.680
So that's pretty sweet.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.760
It's supposed to be coming out sometime this year.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:13.840
The Talos Principle 2 looks incredible.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:17.560
I haven't played the first one, but I really wanted to play the first one.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:23.720
It's a great first person puzzler, and that's supposed to be coming out here also this year

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:25.720
as well.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:28.480
Human Fall Flat 2.

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.480
Pretty cool looking.

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.920
It's a third person puzzler game.

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:36.120
And then my favorite, Baby Steps.

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:41.200
Baby Steps is what they call a literal walking simulator.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.280
This is by Bennett Foddy.

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:49.000
You may remember them from Getting Over It, a very frustrating game, also a game that

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.280
they made a while back called QWOP.

01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:56.760
And well, it is sort of the most annoying fucking game you'll ever play in your life.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:02.760
Imagine a 3D version of QWOP, but it's also an RPG, and that's what you got.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:04.040
And it looks ridiculous.

01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.320
And I love it.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:11.320
And that'll be coming out sometime next year.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:12.320
That's it.

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.760
All right.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.760
Sounds like fun.

01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.760
All right.

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:19.560
Moving on to a story that's kind of developing as we went into OLR tonight.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.240
I just kind of put a placeholder here because I knew that Square Enix was going live at

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:28.440
4 o'clock to do a deeper dive into Final Fantasy 16 and make some big announcements, including

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.680
a demo was expected to come out of this event.

01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:32.680
And it did.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:37.960
They did announce that a demo of Final Fantasy 16 will be released tomorrow on PlayStation

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:38.960
5.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:43.000
If you want to get real exact, 1 o'clock Pacific, 4 a.m. Eastern this morning is when

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.600
that'll go live.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.680
And this is, they're saying a two hour basically prologue.

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.040
And then once you beat it, you get like a battle demo that unlocks.

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:55.480
So I'm guessing the prologue probably doesn't maybe have a ton of gameplay in it.

01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:58.840
It might be a lot of cut scenes to set you up for it, I would imagine.

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.920
But the save data can carry over into the main game.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.200
So essentially you can start playing Final Fantasy 16 tomorrow, but just the first couple

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.200
hours.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.320
So I'm very excited about that as somebody who's excited about 16.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:18.080
Also, you know, they obviously did some, you know, other announcements about the game.

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.760
Some very interesting collaborators on this game.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:27.720
It was announced also the Kingdom Hearts development team helped to develop Final Fantasy 16.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:33.800
And Platinum Games helped to develop a part of Final Fantasy 16.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.800
What the fuck is going on with all these teams lending a hand to Final Fantasy 16?

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.040
I think I know what it is.

01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:40.040
Any cooks in the kitchen?

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.840
No, I think I know what it is.

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:42.960
Because they talked about this.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:46.920
They said the icon battles in the game in an earlier direct, they said the icon battles

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:52.280
would all be very different and unique and take inspiration from other types of games.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:57.480
So I have a feeling Platinum Games probably did one of the icon battles.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.560
Kingdom Hearts team probably did one of the icon battles.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.840
And that's why it's a part of the game.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:06.520
But that's still pretty neat because that shows that there really is going to be some

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.120
variety with the game and some of these battles.

01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:15.280
So I'm very excited to see kind of the credits are going to be like three hours long just

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:18.920
to watch the credits are going to be as long as this prologue playable demo.

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.700
But sounds like it'll be very interesting.

01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:24.260
So that is out again tonight.

01:37:24.260 --> 01:37:26.240
Also going with that, there's some merch.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:31.840
If you want to get yourself a Torgal little plushie, that's right, the little dog that

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:37.440
you can have in the game that you can pet apparently is going to be a plushie.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.320
You can get one for either $39.99 or $120.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:46.240
I'm going to guess one is probably four times bigger than the other as far as the plush

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.240
sizes.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.720
I haven't been able to research all the details on that yet.

01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:54.080
They're also putting up a little moogle, some jewelry, and they put out a brand new trailer

01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.600
that I haven't watched yet, but it's called the Ascension trailer.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.360
So the hype is building up for that game, which releases in 11 days.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.200
So busy summer.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.500
All right, moving on.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:09.480
More game announcements, Dark Sakura.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:17.320
Well, oh, sorry, I had accidentally closed it.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:22.520
Anyway, we love Kojima, don't we?

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.520
Do we?

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.520
No, we do.

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:25.520
We do.

01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:34.200
But at any rate, me as a Mac gamer, I am super, super happy for this, is that the Death Stranding

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.640
director's cut will be on Mac.

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.840
I'm so happy.

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:48.520
I mean, I was already down to play it, but now I actually will get to play it natively

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.840
on my Mac.

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:55.960
And he's also committed to bringing other future games out on Mac, you know, good triple

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.680
A titles.

01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:01.200
And I'm feeling pretty happy about that.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:09.320
Capcom's already on the ball too, with them having released Resident Evil Village on Mac.

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:12.360
So we're seeing some good stuff, very happy.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:18.800
There was a quick little footnote out of Worldwide Developers Conference 2.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:24.200
It's really a much bigger deal than I think they made it out to be.

01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:27.800
It was kind of announced as an asterisk, and this is actually a huge deal.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:31.120
And I'm sorry, I don't know all the details, because again, I'm not a Mac gamer.

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.800
But my understanding is they released some type of driver, basically, that's supposed

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:39.520
to make DirectX stuff, I think that's what it is, a lot easier to kind of run natively

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:40.520
on Mac.

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:44.600
So long story short, they kind of slipped in updates to game drivers that actually are

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:50.200
going to make PC games more likely to run natively on a Mac, basically.

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.960
So this may not be the last that we see something poured over, which would make Whoopi Goldberg

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.960
very happy because she's pissed off Diablo 4 isn't on Mac, because Blizzard usually puts

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.240
their stuff out on Mac, but they didn't put this one out.

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:05.920
So maybe this will be the juice that Blizzard needs.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.920
I don't know.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:11.960
So how about that headset for $3,500?

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.360
There's a reason I didn't talk about it tonight.

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.800
I don't see it as a gaming device.

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.800
Not yet.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.800
Anyway.

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.800
I mean, it was...

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:19.800
If I may.

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:20.800
Sure.

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:23.960
It's a virtual computer environment.

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.200
And it was...

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:32.160
It is a computer, but you are using screens and keyboard and everything in a tailored

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.160
virtual environment.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:38.480
And it's the developers conference, like the first iPhone was a little like it took a while

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:41.960
for that to catch on to like, I kind of feel like this is one of those things was like,

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:46.240
this device isn't for me, but it's for the people that are going to create the big ideas

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:48.120
for this environment.

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.960
And you know, let's see what this looks like five years down the line.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:57.160
I'm really thinking of its potential with accessibility.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.800
So I'm pretty...

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:03.200
I know I can't afford one, but I'm pretty excited to see where computing goes in the

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.200
next 10 years.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.680
I mean, I understand why they called it what they did, because they can say they invented

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:10.680
it.

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:14.360
And to be honest, like it's a mixed messaging anyways, because if it's supposed to be like

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:19.920
a con for corporations to replace their computers or something like that, but then they're also

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:24.080
saying, but you can experience all this stuff with Disney Plus and stuff like that.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.920
So it's very mixed messaging what they're trying to do with it.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920
But yeah, the tech's cool.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.000
And hopefully it drives other people to make tech just as well.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.520
So if nothing else, Apple has extended the life of AR VR with this, you know, like, I

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:43.000
think that this is going to be a part of the conversation for a much longer time.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:47.920
I think people like Zuckerberg, who kind of is dismissive of this, because he has to be,

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.600
you know, it's essentially competition to the meta quest, but secretly, he ought to

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:56.480
be thanking them for keeping this at the forefront of people's mind and all this stuff.

01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:59.400
It's going to cause VR and AR to have more to go with.

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.800
Because honestly, a lot of what they were talking about sounds similar to like the Hololens

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:07.240
thing that I tried that Bobby had like years ago.

01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:11.800
But it's just the technology is much more refined five years down the line, and it's

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.200
just going to get more and more refined five years from now.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:22.120
So I got excited watching people using the software that I use for a lot of my video

01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:25.600
editing and my audio editing, I thought it was pretty neat.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.600
Yeah.

01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.600
And you make a good point.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:32.320
It could do some very interesting things for accessibility, which, you know, to be fair,

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:36.560
let's talk about Microsoft and connect, even though it didn't, you know, it was a flash

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:41.200
in the pan for gaming, we'll say, connect still did a lot for accessibility and its

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:45.320
usage in, you know, sterile environments as well and what it can do.

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:50.080
And so it'll be interesting to see kind of what this brings to the table for unique environments

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.080
and things like that.

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.680
But I just think like, it's just not part of the conversation right now as a mass consumer

01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.880
device.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.000
This is a peek at the future.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.400
If they ever decide to drop it down like to, you know, $200 someday.

01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:09.240
I'd say a thousand, drop it down to a thousand, I'm interested.

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:17.040
There's no possible way that's going to be anything less than even $1,500 on resell or

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.040
anything like that.

01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:19.040
I'm talking like far in the future.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:25.040
I mean, like, what happens, what happens every time Apple announces something, the phone,

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:30.360
the watch, that all the other people are going to come out of the woodwork, the Samsungs,

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:35.120
they're all going to come out of the woodwork and come out with their cheaper responses.

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.560
And some people love that stuff.

01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.560
Some people don't.

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.280
You get the choice as a consumer.

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.640
So there's just, this is just going to open the door again.

01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:52.940
The life of ARVR has been given a new, this is a time extent on VR AR and will allow this

01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:54.040
whole thing to catch on more.

01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:59.880
Just saying you can finally realize what Pokemon Go should have been or make Ingress even that

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.620
much better.

01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.820
Can we talk about what Ingress just implemented?

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:07.860
Because it's garbage, garbage.

01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:09.940
It's overclock hacking, but it's fine.

01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:14.260
It's a point to using the scans, the Pokestop scans and all this stuff.

01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:18.700
Because all the scans are so terrible, it doesn't work.

01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:22.300
Like I'll tap the ground to put the cube on the ground to try to hack it.

01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:26.660
And the cube flies up in the tree because it thinks the tree is the ground.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:35.300
Because it's, anyway, I digress, but that is not the future of AR, that's for sure.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.500
I had been thinking about this, something I was talking to another friend about is,

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:45.860
and this actually goes back to a documentary I was watching about some surgeons using Bluetooth

01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:54.740
to connect a, well, a former quadriplegic, he's now just missing the use of his legs,

01:44:54.740 --> 01:45:01.300
but he was fully paralyzed before, and they're using Bluetooth to connect segments of his

01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:07.860
upper spinal cord with the lower end to send the signals from the brain using Bluetooth

01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:08.860
to the lower extremities.

01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:15.940
And he has to use a pretty hefty brace for it, but he's been able, and the equipment

01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:23.220
is still pretty hardcore right now, but he was able to walk up a flight of steps by himself

01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:24.220
using Bluetooth.

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:31.220
And if you think about implementing technology like that with a computer like this, someone

01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:39.080
can actually do any kind of work that someone with full use of their body would be able

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:40.080
to do.

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:46.100
And I think that just looking at how these technologies can overlap, because, I mean,

01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:50.220
and again, this is not a VR headset, this is a whole computer.

01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:54.540
And I think that it would be just really awesome to have those sorts of things out

01:45:54.540 --> 01:46:01.020
in the medical community so that it can go to benefit people who might need the extra

01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.020
assistance.

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:11.180
I mean, there is so much happening right now just in the field of bionics and cybernetics

01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:14.020
that I'm impressed, I really am.

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:17.980
Not the AI stuff, not so much.

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:21.420
You have to have a degree of machine learning to advance it.

01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.420
Technology is so fucking rad.

01:46:22.420 --> 01:46:26.300
I just think of as a diabetic and watching some of the things that my grandma, when she

01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:31.820
had it, having to monitor her blood sugar so many times a day, but now I see people

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:32.820
that are type 1 di...

01:46:32.820 --> 01:46:38.260
I'm not type 1, so I still have some insulin, I just have to watch what I eat basically.

01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:42.360
But I look at type 1 diabetic friends and now with the help of constant glucose monitors

01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:47.820
as well as insulin pumps and phones that kind of bridge between them, you basically have

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:50.900
a robotic pancreas is basically what it is now.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:54.580
But technology allows that without you having to draw your blood a million times a day because

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:58.940
you have the CGM that does that and then the insulin pump that says, oh, the blood sugar

01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:03.300
is a certain level, we're going to just automatically get the insulin going and all that stuff.

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:04.300
It's amazing.

01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:10.720
And to tie it back to Apple or whoever doing these types of technologies, it's a pretty

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:16.580
not well kept secret that a space that Apple wants to get into with the Apple Watch is

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:19.140
blood-free glucose monitoring.

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:22.940
And it's a technology that they're working on, they're not there yet, but when they get

01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:29.420
there, that Apple Watch, let's be real, eventually the technology will get swiped by other companies

01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:30.420
too.

01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:35.560
But when Apple does it, that Apple Watch will be transformative.

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:40.680
As a diabetic, I can't think of something I want more than something that monitors my

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:43.900
blood sugar like that, as long as it's accurate, but they're not going to release something

01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:48.100
like that until they have approval from the FDA, just like the electrocardiogram thing.

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:49.100
Exactly.

01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:55.180
And that electrocardiogram in the fall detection has actually saved lives of people that I

01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.180
know.

01:47:56.180 --> 01:48:06.900
So I'm just going to go out there and say that I'm absolutely in awe.

01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:07.940
Technology is fucking rad.

01:48:07.940 --> 01:48:10.220
I love living in the future.

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:16.300
And the thing is, is that we grew up as this technology grew up.

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:17.300
We've been moving.

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:20.760
See, people are saying that, oh, it's, you know, millennials, blah, blah, blah.

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:26.820
This is going to be the ones, you know, who are keeping the tech industry, you know, the

01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:30.180
innovations in tech going, but like, no, it's actually us who grew up with it.

01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:35.500
We've seen where it's been firsthand and we know where it can go firsthand.

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:40.120
So yeah, you know, I mean, I'm not, I'm not just

01:48:40.120 --> 01:48:45.700
counting any other, I hate the whole generational argument, but I am just thinking that we in

01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:53.460
particular are in this place where we remember going out to play outside and having pixel

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:56.420
graphics and computers with cassette tapes.

01:48:56.420 --> 01:49:03.100
But we also appreciate, you know, our high end systems and our Mac books and, you know,

01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:06.760
being able to go on a virtual walk and everything.

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:07.760
So.

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:08.760
All right.

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.700
Well, let's move on.

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:13.940
Let's talk about, let's talk about something else that might need to grow up a little bit

01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.580
in our next story.

01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:17.580
Yeah.

01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:24.120
So there was the whole, I guess it was a blog post that was put out by Twitch talking about

01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:31.300
changes to their ad policy, basically that they wouldn't allow burned in ads to display,

01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:34.300
you know, video or audio ads and that type of stuff.

01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:35.880
And then everybody was pissed off about it.

01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:42.220
So then they said, no, no, no, no, no, you have misinterpreted or then they walked it

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:47.380
back even further saying today's branded content policy update was overly broad and it's create

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:49.460
confusion and frustration.

01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:51.080
And we apologize for that.

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:57.100
And then I want to say that they added something to that, like that it was just, yeah, we,

01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:01.940
we do not intend to limit streamer's ability to enter into direct relationships with sponsors.

01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.280
And we understand that this is an important part of how streamers earn revenue.

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.680
We want to clarify our existing ad policy was intended to prohibit third party ad networks

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.540
from selling burned in video and display ads on Twitch, which is consistent with other

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:15.540
services.

01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:21.060
We missed the mark with our policy language and we'll rewrite the guidelines to be clear.

01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:26.700
It's almost as if you consulted with your partners and or affiliates before making these

01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:31.460
announcements, they might tell you some of this feedback.

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:33.160
Yeah.

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:37.520
And then it's still in their policy though, that saying that you can't do the burn in

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:41.400
ads either, but it'll be interesting to see how they enforce it because YouTube has a

01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:43.980
similar type of thing, but they don't care.

01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:46.980
They just allow that to happen for the most part.

01:50:46.980 --> 01:50:52.520
I think it's when they were talking about like major players, like just selling ads.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:57.540
So imagine if you will, like a stream labs or something like that selling that ad space

01:50:57.540 --> 01:50:58.540
or something like that.

01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:00.120
To be fair to Twitch.

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.260
I understand why they want to be the ones selling ads.

01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:07.300
Like I get that to an extent, like they don't want, and I think when they clarified the

01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:09.540
language is that it's an ad network.

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:14.180
They don't want a competing, like whoever selling, you know, ads and so forth.

01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:20.100
But obviously, you know, you look at a summer games done quick, a nonprofit that's bolstered

01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:25.380
up by having ads and sponsorship on their stream to be able to help fundraise over that.

01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:28.700
I don't think that's ever what Twitch intended to target, but unfortunately, because they

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:33.860
didn't talk to enough people, they inadvertently did, and that's why they had to correct course

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:35.400
real quick.

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:40.440
As Bobby points out in chat, they made graphics for it.

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:42.640
It was not broad or misinterpreted.

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:43.640
Yeah.

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:48.160
Like this was very well thought out on their end.

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:55.640
And as he points out, to a point, they snuck in the no simulcasting to their terms of

01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:57.020
service as well.

01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:59.820
Whereas that used to be an affiliate partner contract thing.

01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:06.760
Now it's blanketed to everybody to which a lot of streamers are like, listen, you know,

01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.980
I can either stream to like these eight platforms or just Twitch.

01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:12.980
What do you think I'm going to do?

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:17.060
I mean, obviously, I'm just going to stream to those other platforms and not Twitch.

01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:21.480
I personally think I see and I've been to many discussions on this topic over the years

01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:26.140
and I have yet to be won over that splitting yourself in eight different directions is

01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:27.580
a good idea.

01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:30.900
Like you have to focus on one place first.

01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:34.580
But that's, you know, some people disagree with me fundamentally, and that's fine.

01:52:34.580 --> 01:52:38.420
I do what I need to do with my brand, y'all do what you need to do with your brands.

01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:42.140
And that's the beauty of an open market in this space.

01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:48.600
So I just don't think it's a smart idea to simulcast to that many places anyway, because

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.320
you can't, you can't monitor that many chat rooms at once by yourself.

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:56.620
You can't monitor socials in that many places at once.

01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:58.780
So I don't know.

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:01.060
But anyway, let's see other comments in chat.

01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:02.060
S.G.O.

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:05.360
Hunter Matt says, I find it funny that Twitch made a massive deal with the WWE this week

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.940
for simulcast type shows and shows with superstars, which would have tons of ads and sponsors

01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:13.660
and everything that Twitch was going to nix, granted they had a special deal with them,

01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:14.660
but it's funny.

01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:17.480
I don't think there's any irony in that at all.

01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.660
The thing is, is that Twitch is making money on it.

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:21.260
It was their deal.

01:53:21.260 --> 01:53:25.060
It's not the people on their platform making their own deal.

01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:26.700
There's a universe of difference.

01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:27.700
Yeah.

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:28.700
S.G.O.

01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:32.820
Hunter Matt says, folks, we're running to Kick by BlackWoolz says Kick is owned by CryptoBros.

01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:36.880
They don't necessarily want to address how people are abused, quote unquote, free speech.

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:42.300
That's like Kick just needs to, I need Kick to prove that they're grownups before I'm

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:43.780
going to take interest in it.

01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:47.100
Because right now, when I go to the site, it's casino, casino, casino, it looks, it

01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:49.320
just looks like a bunch of garbage.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.880
That's just, I'm just calling it like it is.

01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:57.360
For me to believe in Kick, I'm going to need to show that it's run by grownups and a really

01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:01.720
solid anti-harassment policy would show that it's run by grownups.

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:07.760
But if they're going to take the Elon Musk approach to like, then that guy is a child

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:10.880
and it is not, then that is showing that it is not being run by grownups.

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:20.380
Well, I mean, their whole thing is no control and decentralization, so whatever.

01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:22.020
I'm not going to go to it.

01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:27.260
I'm going to keep calling them out until they, you know, if they ever do something about

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.260
it.

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:31.420
But the thing is, is that as long as people can go there and be hateful and get away with

01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:37.820
it because they're making more money doing it, fuck off, I'll stick with Twitch.

01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:42.840
At least they've got really good policies for dealing with, they were really like the

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:46.440
last round of hate raids that were going out, they're really on the ball with restricting

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:47.440
things like that.

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.440
Right.

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:52.480
And it took them a minute to get there, but they're there, you know, so.

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:55.720
I'm happily in their research, you know, program.

01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:01.300
I'm happy to do my bit to make it better, but, you know, the big thing that they need

01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:07.800
to address is, you know, things like, you know, charity streams.

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:14.080
I think if people are going through the built in charity extension, then I think that probably

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.840
gets around that.

01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:20.000
I mean, they've got to definitely rephrase that.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.380
They're going to have to rewrite part of that agreement.

01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:26.240
That's just the end of the story.

01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:30.160
And you also can't charge somebody for something that they didn't pay for to begin with.

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.220
I'm just going to say that.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:33.220
All right.

01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:34.220
All right.

01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:38.420
Like for leaving something they didn't put money in to begin with, I should say.

01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:39.420
All right.

01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:44.900
Well, before we get to our classic game of sorts for this week, I want to talk a little

01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:48.660
bit about because it is June and it was actually Pride weekend here in Sacramento.

01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.860
I didn't go this year, though, with Alan being sick and everything.

01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:52.940
I didn't go.

01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:57.340
But I heard the Rebecca Black concert was really fun because that was who the headliner

01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:59.660
was this year was Rebecca Black.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:04.520
That Friday song is like 10 years old at this point.

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:07.520
The last album she put out is legit club hits.

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.600
It's actually pretty decent.

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:11.140
I like Saturday.

01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:14.280
She came out as, I think, Pam a few years ago.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:19.600
She's part of the community because she's in her late 20s now.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.480
Friday was when she was 17 and that was 10 years ago, so she's like 27 now.

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.880
So she's definitely come a long way.

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:29.780
Anyway, but my point is, it is Pride Month and there's a lot of companies that are doing

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.460
things for Pride Month.

01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:35.820
To recap, I want to just quickly state some of the things that are going on.

01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.860
Some of these things we have brought up in prior episodes.

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.180
I just want to make that clear.

01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:41.500
I am just recapping for Pride Month.

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.820
What all is going on of a rainbow variety?

01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:48.900
Blizzard Entertainment has done some Pride updates to Overwatch 2, icons and name cards,

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:57.540
and then, of course, they also confirmed Batiste and Pharah as canon in LGBTQIA community.

01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:01.780
They are also selling Pride-themed merchandise with the proceeds going to the National Center

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:03.520
for Transgender Equality.

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:08.080
So if you want to get Diablo logo and transgender pride colors, that is something they're selling

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:09.080
on the store right now.

01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:11.840
I know because I'm probably buying one.

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.240
So that is something they're doing.

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:18.680
Crystal Dynamics is running a month-long funding raising initiative for the It Gets Better

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:19.680
project.

01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:25.400
They're going to do a panel for their various studio members in the community on June 28th.

01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:31.020
And then on June 30th, they're going to partner with Drag Race alumnus Rock M. Sakura, who

01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:34.260
is very underrated in her run on that show, by the way.

01:57:34.260 --> 01:57:35.940
She's a very talented queen.

01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:38.860
She's going to host a charity stream for the It Gets Better project.

01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:40.620
That's all from Crystal Dynamics.

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:44.520
Darkpaw Games doing new EverQuest 2 content.

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:45.520
Very cool.

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:47.460
You can download that until July 9th.

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:53.400
Iron Galaxy will be doing a panel as well on June 15th with their employee resource

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.400
group.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:58.120
And they're going to participate in the Pride Parade in Chicago on June 25th.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:58:03.160
Microsoft announced a new partnership with GLAAD that's supposed to help them with their

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:07.780
LGBTQIA plus storytelling and games and staffers on Xbox.

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:09.280
People like to see the representation.

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.440
It's great.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:16.080
You can also find some curated game lists for June and onward, including some transgender

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:20.460
and non-binary community games collection, as well as an LGBTQIA plus community games

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.820
collection.

01:58:21.820 --> 01:58:25.220
They're also promising Pride Month streams and other content.

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:27.860
Last week on the show, I remember this got brought up, but just mentioning again, the

01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:33.260
Queer Games Bundle is available with over 450 games and tabletop games and so forth.

01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:38.420
That's all on itch.io, but you can get more information as well on Twitter at Queer Game

01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:40.180
Bundle.

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:43.440
Riot Games is doing a Pride Month recognition with their players.

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:48.520
You can get new icons, emotes, titles, and other content from over the years returning.

01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.280
That's all free for players.

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:55.300
Sega announced they're going to be doing Sega Pride, a charity fundraising event for Kaleidoscope

01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:58.240
Trust from June 22nd to June 30th.

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:02.820
That will be streamed on their official Twitch channel and organization members from Kaleidoscope

01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:07.420
will be answering questions about their work and the importance of the charity.

01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:13.600
Tybo will be doing Pride Month events as well, partnering with It Gets Better, Copenhagen

01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:18.200
Pride, Gay Gaming Pros, and so forth.

01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:22.520
Twitch is going to feature a collection of LGBTQIA plus streamers on the front page throughout

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.800
the month, so that's cool.

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:28.400
I guess the invite for Dark Soccer and myself got lost in the mail.

01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.640
No, I assume they're inviting partners, which is what they tend to do, so yay to our friends

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:34.240
that will be there.

01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:41.060
Press 2 will be doing donations to the organization Mind Out, and there will also be an interview

01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:45.740
on Pride being featured in Alba, a wildlife adventure.

01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:51.060
And Zynga also partnered with It Gets Better and Take Two, and Zynga donated $50,000 to

01:59:51.060 --> 01:59:55.780
the initiative, which is very cool, and they will also be doing a celebration with interviews

01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:59.700
and staff of different genders and sexualities, and there will be Pride themed content in

01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:04.600
their games, zynga.com slash playwithpride, all one word.

02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:08.040
So you know what?

02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:13.840
To the streamers before who were running their mouths on Twitter about things they shouldn't

02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:20.140
be talking about, I just want you to see through all of those various initiatives, you are

02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:23.740
in the wrong.

02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:28.760
This rainbow tidal wave is coming, we're here, we're queer, get used to it.

02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:29.700
Thank you very much.

02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:38.180
All right, let's travel back to a simpler time when streamers weren't getting big deals

02:00:38.180 --> 02:00:39.620
like this for in-game content.

02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:42.420
But once a month, Dark Sakura puts a twist on it.

02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:44.060
But first, I'm going to run the bumper.

02:00:44.060 --> 02:01:00.000
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
out a classic and tell you about it.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.800
It's time for the classic game of the week.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:10.600
But once a month, Dark Sakura picks a non-video game to highlight.

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:13.240
What did you pick for us this week, Dark Sakura?

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:18.820
I picked mousetrap, as in the board game mousetrap.

02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:19.820
It's mechanical.

02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:21.940
There's things that move, right?

02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:23.440
No, I love this choice.

02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.200
I fucking love this game.

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:34.920
So the original mousetrap board game was first published by Ideal in 1963 for two to four

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:35.920
players.

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:40.660
And it was one of the first mass produced three dimensional board games.

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:47.140
Basically you are building a giant mousetrap in the style of a Rube Goldberg machine.

02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:53.540
And the point is to trap the opponent's mice.

02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:59.140
And there's actually, the gameplay has changed over time, even though the playfield has not.

02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:06.860
So the original premise of it was that, and first of all, this was invented, the concept

02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:11.660
of it was invented by Marvin Glass and a designer named Gordon Barlow.

02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:19.380
They were for Marvin Glass and Associates, and they got their patent for it in 1967.

02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:27.440
The original version of it was supposed to be a game that the players didn't get a lot

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.780
of choice in, as far as how to play it.

02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:37.680
Multiple rules, almost no decision making, something that was sort of patterned after

02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:43.040
Candylander Chutes and Ladders, or originally Stakes and Ladders.

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:48.340
You would take turn rolling a die, and to move your little mouse guy across the game

02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:58.640
board, and you go from the start in a continuous loop at the end, the little path would go.

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:04.400
There is a mouse trap that's assembled in the center of the board, and as you land on

02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:09.760
build spaces, you would add another piece to the mouse trap and build it as you go along.

02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:15.120
So it's always built in the same order.

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:23.060
And then along the end loop are a lot more build spaces, so that if the trap isn't finished,

02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:25.120
it can be completed.

02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:31.280
And there's a cheese space that's right underneath where the cage will go, and a turn crank space.

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:39.320
So if someone lands on turn crank, when an opponent is on the cheese space, you turn

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:44.280
the crank and it launches the machine, and if it works properly, if you weren't missing

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:50.040
parts, the cage would fall on the cheese space, and the opponent gets eliminated from the

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:51.040
game.

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:57.520
The last one winning is the last one who doesn't get caged is the winner.

02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:07.360
So the game was redesigned, the board was, in 1975 with adding cheese pieces that could

02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.600
allow you to push opponents into the trap space.

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:17.200
You would get these tokens, and if the trap is vacant, when you land on turn crank, you

02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:23.400
use the token to roll a die to move an opponent.

02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:28.480
Modified version in the UK had three mouse traps, the special trigger that would work

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:37.160
at random, and a different board game, different components, and instead of the model bathtub,

02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:44.080
they had a model toilet that would trigger everything.

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:48.880
And then of course, there were other versions of it, there was one from Elephant and Friends

02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:57.040
in 2014, you had a barrel instead of a dice, and all kinds of different changes, but the

02:04:57.040 --> 02:04:59.920
trap is built before the start of the game.

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:05.840
In 2010, Classic Mouse Trap was re-released, it had some major changes.

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:10.840
The object this time was to collect six cheese pieces, and instead of being eliminated from

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:15.800
the game when you're caught in the trap, you had to forfeit a piece of cheese to the

02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:18.400
opponent who traps you.

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:22.440
And then of course the trap was modified so that you don't use a crank, you just press

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:23.440
a lever.

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:27.520
It's got a plastic stop sign on it.

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:33.880
Now a little bit more about the history of the game.

02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:43.000
Firstly, Marvin Glass did state that he was greatly influenced by Rube Goldberg's illustrations,

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.120
but they didn't want to pay the licensing or royalty fees.

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:52.320
He also did two other games that were based on Goldberg designs, one called Crazy Clock

02:05:52.320 --> 02:06:00.640
Game in 1964, and Fish Bait Game in 1965, neither credit Goldberg.

02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:05.240
Which would have opened the door for Goldberg to have pursued legal action, but at the time

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:11.360
he was really old and close to retirement, and he decided not to take the legal action

02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:16.960
because as it said, inspiration and ideas are not intellectual property that can be

02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:20.320
protected by a copyright, trademark, or patent.

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:25.720
What he did, however, was he sold the licensing right for his drawings to another company

02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:35.680
called Model Products so that the royalties would go to someone else.

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:41.160
So that Glass could never get them.

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:47.000
And really both of those games are other, like I said, Rube Goldberg-esque machines.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:59.880
One of them is that you have to operate the machine and whoever is the first one to succeed

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:03.720
with the installation is the winner, and then the Fish Bait Game is that you are fishermen

02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:09.040
who have to catch a man eating fish.

02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:16.560
As far as legacies go, in 1990, Mouse Trap was adapted into a board game as part of a

02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:23.760
British children's show called Motormouth, and the contestants took the place of the

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:27.000
mice in the life-size board game.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.880
And then there is the thing that I think I told you about earlier, Rob.

02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:42.520
Mark Perez of San Francisco formed a ginormous, giant, what he calls life-size mousetrap.

02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:52.000
It is 16 pieces, 500,000-pound interactive connective sculpture that's set up on a 6,500-square-foot

02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:00.400
game board, and it has a little vaudeville-style show and a music score by a one-woman band

02:08:00.400 --> 02:08:02.640
named Esmeralda Strange.

02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:09.040
You have sexy mice, can-can dancers, clown workers, acrobats, and other scenes that are

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:13.760
dedicated to the game.

02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:24.520
It gets traveled and assembled by 25 tons of cranes and equipment in a semi-truck.

02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:29.800
The ball bearing, they use a bowling ball instead, and it ends with the destruction

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:33.000
of an automobile by dropping a safe on it.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.480
They drop in a literal old-style bank safe on a car.

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:38.480
That's awesome.

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:39.720
It's very rewarding.

02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:42.040
You can't actually play it.

02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:48.920
You can't play on it as the ball, but you can watch the ball eventually break things.

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:50.240
And even Smithsonian Magazine-

02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:54.720
And yes, I'm trying to show that part of it live here on stream, trying to get to that

02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:57.000
part where the safe will crash the car.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.360
We're almost there.

02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:02.880
And you see the moving parts on it and everything, that's pretty cool.

02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:12.440
But Smithsonian Magazine reports that the exhibit's merit teaches physics and simple

02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440
machines.

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:17.920
So, there you go.

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:26.760
Mouse trap inspired by Rube Goldberg and inspiring dudes from San Francisco to crash cars with

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:30.280
a safe using a bowling ball.

02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:36.040
There you go.

02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:38.380
I'm sorry, I've been muted this whole time while I'm talking.

02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:39.880
There it is, your classic game of the week, mouse trap.

02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:43.140
Sorry, I was trying to double close all those windows because you had like four different

02:09:43.140 --> 02:09:44.800
movies playing as B-roll there.

02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:51.560
But yeah, mouse trap inspiring different arts and all that good stuff.

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:53.080
So, great pick.

02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:58.480
I think a lot of us remember that game from when we were younger, even if we never actually-

02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.200
I think people in chat were saying, I didn't actually play the game, I just like to build

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:03.200
the trap.

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:04.200
Exactly.

02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:12.400
I did post an image in the chat and I wish I had a way to share this with the podcast

02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:20.920
listeners of a picture from an eBay listing of an original 1963 mouse trap.

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:26.600
And it didn't change much into the 80s, I'll tell you that, because that's what my-

02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:30.760
Yeah, the contraption itself really doesn't look that much different, honestly.

02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:34.880
I always wanted to call her my cousin, but in reality, she was my aunt who was a year

02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:43.440
older than me, thanks to my former stepdad marrying a younger woman and having a kid

02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:46.280
right before I was born.

02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.280
Families are weird, y'all.

02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:49.280
Yep.

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:50.280
All right.

02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:52.480
Great pick for a not video game.

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:58.400
But again, that's kind of the fun is it's like, honestly, it may not be a video game,

02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:04.160
but I think there's a lot of that creativity and putting things together and I'm certainly

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:11.640
not surprised whatsoever to hear Loki, a Minecraft fan and a Sim build fan, a Lego fan, was also

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:12.640
a mousetrap fan.

02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:17.040
I feel like that game was just a building block to all of that stuff.

02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:21.280
I want them to release like a super mousetrap where it's got even more-

02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.680
What, the safe on a car wasn't enough for you?

02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:26.680
No, I mean like for a home version.

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:27.680
Okay.

02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:34.440
I mean, I do like the Rube Goldberg machines, the guy with the squirrels.

02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:36.280
Have you ever watched those videos?

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:37.280
Not that one.

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:40.000
I mean, I've seen the pictures and, you know.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.160
Well, it's not really a machine.

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.120
It's just he creates this obstacle course for squirrels, but there's like little goals

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:48.360
that happen at the end and it's pretty funny.

02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.880
Oh, Mark Rober.

02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:50.880
Yeah.

02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:51.880
All right.

02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:56.720
We're going to talk about some other quick headlines around the industry this week.

02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:03.200
We're almost to the end of our scheduled stories tonight because we knew that the wrap ups

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:06.480
would take a very long time at the top tonight, so we didn't schedule a lot of stories in

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.600
this half of the show, but we want to touch on a few headlines real quick before we get

02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:16.120
to our listener roundtable via participate at orangelodgeradio.com, our email and our

02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.320
Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.960
But first, Loki, some headlines.

02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:26.340
Yeah, there's been some updates to Nintendo Switch online.

02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:31.800
So for June, we're going to be getting some brand new Super Nintendo and Nintendo games.

02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:39.760
Starting off with, of course, we have looks like Kirby's Tilt and Tumble and Blaster Master

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:40.760
Enemy Below.

02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:47.280
Those are going to be new Game Boy titles and then Harvest Moon on the Super Nintendo

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.640
and looks like Mystery Tower, which is going to be for the NES.

02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:56.640
I've never heard of Mystery Tower Harvest Moon is cool.

02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:57.920
For sure.

02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:04.220
And then more showcases coming out later this month, so in the very near future tomorrow,

02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:06.980
we have the Capcom Showcase 2023.

02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:11.580
It's going to be at 3 p.m. Pacific Time, 6 p.m. Eastern.

02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:18.220
And they're going to have different announcements available there as well as Ubisoft Forward,

02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:22.460
which is going to be also tomorrow as well, June 12th.

02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:30.860
And that is happening early in the morning at 945 Pacific Daylight Time and 645 Eastern

02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:31.860
Time.

02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:32.860
So.

02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:33.860
Cool.

02:13:33.860 --> 02:13:40.140
Oh, I'm sorry, C.E.S.T., that's not Eastern Time, that would I don't know if that is Central

02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:41.140
Central.

02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:45.440
No, that's not something it's several hours later.

02:13:45.440 --> 02:13:48.900
So that's got to be European time or some C.E.S.T.

02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:51.740
Oh, I thought you said C.E.S.T.

02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:54.860
No, not C.E.S.T., I know what C.E.S.T. means.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:58.940
Some of the games are going to be showing off in their avatar frontiers of Pandora.

02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:03.740
Forgot that they're making an avatar game, Assassin's Creed Mirage, which I mean honestly

02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:06.940
when I saw the trailer for that, I thought it was Prince of Persia.

02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:13.280
The Crew Motorfest and an unannounced game, which I think is probably Star Wars since

02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:15.380
they already show that.

02:14:15.380 --> 02:14:16.860
So that would be Star Wars there.

02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:19.340
And then other things will be showing off later on.

02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:24.100
They're going to have a live stream that covers some more stuff from that.

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:27.180
And C.E.S.T. is Central European Summer Time.

02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:32.380
It is seven hours ahead of Eastern, which would be 10 hours ahead of us.

02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:34.460
On the West Coast.

02:14:34.460 --> 02:14:35.460
The more you know.

02:14:35.460 --> 02:14:40.020
OK, Dark Sakura, how about some other you had some other WWDC stuff?

02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:41.420
I think it was.

02:14:41.420 --> 02:14:42.420
I did.

02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:48.720
And it was really just the winners of the 2023 Apple Design Awards.

02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:52.420
And I'm only going to I'm not going to necessarily say what they were for, but I just wanted

02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:56.020
to mention the games in there that won.

02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:59.340
One of them is Stitched by Lykke Studios out of Thailand.

02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:04.260
And that's actually pretty fun and very relaxing.

02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:15.180
There was also Afterplace, which is a pixel game by Evan Kies here in the US.

02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:21.380
There are crazy spiders on it, I'm just going to say.

02:15:21.380 --> 02:15:26.260
Another game called Railbound, which no words, no points.

02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:29.900
You just build tracks.

02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:33.420
Just a fun little puzzler.

02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:39.060
And then another one called Ending by Handy Games out of Germany, where you play as a

02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:43.380
fox trying to escape an environmental disaster.

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:47.420
It's very stray-like, but simpler.

02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:48.420
And then.

02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:52.340
I'm just seeing if there's any other games on here.

02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:55.860
Resident Evil Village, of course, also won.

02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:58.900
Marvel Snap also won.

02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:06.140
So that one actually got a design layout award.

02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:08.140
So there you go.

02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:09.140
Nice.

02:16:09.140 --> 02:16:10.140
All right.

02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:11.140
Well, for fans.

02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:12.140
Oh.

02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:15.900
Well, and I should point out that some of these games that won were not necessarily

02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:17.900
in singularly game categories.

02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.900
These were all design.

02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:21.900
All right.

02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:26.460
So one game well-designed that I know a lot of you were really enjoying, but you don't

02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:30.100
have much longer to enjoy it on Game Pass, sadly, because it's going away this month.

02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:35.020
But for those of you that purchased Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge, you're

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:39.180
going to get some expanding DLC that comes out later in 2023.

02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:44.260
Dimension Shellshock is the DLC that's coming, and they have already announced one of the

02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:51.160
big characters to this DLC is Usagi Miyamoto from Usagi Yojimbo fame, who is, of course,

02:16:51.160 --> 02:16:57.680
the rabbit that crossed over in some of the comics with the Ninja Turtles.

02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.680
That's kind of a cool little deep cut that they're bringing over into the game.

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:07.600
I used to totally read the Usagi Yojimbo comics back in the day, and he was in the cartoon,

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:10.320
the 90s cartoon quite a bit.

02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:14.740
And as part of this DLC, since it is called Dimension Shellshock, this means there has

02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:20.280
to be some time-spanning portals that will bring Usagi to modern times, which means there

02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:23.960
are portals that take the modern times to ancient Japan.

02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:27.780
Hello, the third movie, Ninja Turtles movie.

02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:29.040
Maybe it'll be similar in plot.

02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.420
No, I don't know.

02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:32.640
There is going to be more other playable characters.

02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:36.760
Usagi is the only one confirmed as of now, but people are certainly guessing on what

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.080
the others could be.

02:17:38.080 --> 02:17:43.660
This DLC comes out later this year for the Switch, PS4 and 5, Windows PC, and Xbox One.

02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:48.360
No price as of yet, but it will come later.

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.320
So pretty cool.

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:54.920
All right, that is our rapid fire news.

02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:59.680
So let's talk about what games are coming out this week, as if last week wasn't good

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:00.680
enough for you.

02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:02.280
What's coming out this week?

02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.280
Loki will start in the US.

02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:05.440
Yeah, didn't you get enough games last week?

02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:09.200
I know, Street Fighter 6 and Diablo 4, you ought to be pretty busy.

02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:16.120
Yeah, we have a Front Mission 2 remake on Nintendo Switch.

02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:22.160
We've got Doredogne, I don't know how to pronounce that.

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.720
That's my best guess.

02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:28.640
That's going to be on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and

02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:37.760
Xbox Series, Blue Protocol on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Daydream Forgotten Sorrow

02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:48.120
on PC, Birdie Wing Golf Girls Story on Nintendo Switch, Crime Boss Rock-A-City on PlayStation

02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:55.880
5 and Xbox Series, the game sucks, don't buy it, Jack Gene on Nintendo Switch, Layers of

02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:03.760
Fear on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, Steel Assault on PlayStation 4, PlayStation

02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:13.400
5, Xbox One and Xbox Series, Formula One 23 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox

02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:19.640
One, Xbox Series, and last but not least, Park Beyond on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox

02:19:19.640 --> 02:19:20.640
Series.

02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:25.680
All right, looking in Japan at what releases are coming out over there.

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:31.080
On the Switch this week, we have Hakuyoki, Sweet School Life for the Nintendo Switch.

02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:37.440
It is in a regular and a limited edition or a special edition, and Kamisama Tokoi Gokoro

02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:43.120
is out this week as well on the Switch, and the House of the Dead remake is also out on

02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:44.920
the Switch this week.

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:47.480
Those are the releases on the Nintendo Switch.

02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:54.320
On the PlayStation 5, Railway Empire 2 gets a deluxe edition release on the PlayStation

02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:55.320
5.

02:19:55.320 --> 02:20:00.200
I think we have that here on Game Pass actually, but I know train sims are really fun in Japan,

02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:01.760
so there's that.

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:06.120
And then the House of the Dead remake is also available on the PlayStation 5 this week as

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:07.120
well.

02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:09.920
Dark Soccer, how about Europe?

02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:14.200
I actually have to say something that I bought earlier today after choosing the classic game.

02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:15.200
Okay.

02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:18.080
I bought a world's smallest mouse trap.

02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:19.640
Like a pocket version or something?

02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:22.080
Yeah, to go with my world's smallest scrabble.

02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:24.280
Oh, that's kind of cute.

02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:25.800
These are a whole series of things.

02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:26.800
Oh, okay.

02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:28.680
Most of them work.

02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:35.320
I mean, clearly not the mean microscopic Polaroid camera, but I love them.

02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:36.880
There's even an operation.

02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:37.880
There's a few different ones.

02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:39.880
They're pretty cool.

02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:46.360
Anyway, as far as what's coming out on the 13th for PlayStation Xbox Switch, we have

02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.800
Power Wash Simulator.

02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:53.800
On the 15th for PlayStation Switch, we have Galguardian's Demon Purge.

02:20:53.800 --> 02:21:00.800
On the 16th for, and these both are PlayStation and Xbox, we have Park Beyond and F123.

02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:06.800
P.S., if someone wants to give me a McLaren F1, please do.

02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:08.800
I just want one.

02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:09.800
Please.

02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:10.800
Thank you.

02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:12.800
I'm sure one is on its way right now.

02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:13.800
All right.

02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:17.800
I've actually driven one around the box, around the block.

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:18.800
Fine.

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:20.800
It's your turn to have a say.

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.800
If you want to send us an email, you can do that.

02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:24.800
Participate at orangesontraday.com.

02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:27.800
Sadly, I think we are email-less another week.

02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:29.800
I'll let Jamie confirm that.

02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:30.800
Mm-hmm.

02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:31.800
Oh, no, no.

02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:32.800
We got one last second.

02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:33.800
Oh, we did.

02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:34.800
Okay.

02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:43.800
I think we should just have a voice clip of Cooney from Weird Al's UHF.

02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:44.800
Uh-huh.

02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:45.800
Nothing.

02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:47.800
Absolutely nothing.

02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:51.800
Hi, all.

02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:52.800
It's Mishi.

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:54.800
I hope you're having a great weekend.

02:21:54.800 --> 02:21:56.800
Sorry in advance for spelling errors.

02:21:56.800 --> 02:21:57.800
It's okay.

02:21:57.800 --> 02:21:58.800
It's more...

02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:03.800
Anyway, with that being said, my gaming week consisted of Diablo 4, Zelda, Tears of the

02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.800
Kingdom, which I finally got a new PC.

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:09.800
I ended up being able to play a game I was putting off simply because my old PC wouldn't

02:22:09.800 --> 02:22:10.800
run it.

02:22:10.800 --> 02:22:12.800
The game is called Sunhaven.

02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:15.800
It's your typical farming game, similar to Stardew Valley, with fantasy elements thrown

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:18.800
in, like dragons, fae folk, and the like.

02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:22.800
It's just a really cozy game if you want something relaxing to play.

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:25.800
I'm slowly working on Diablo and Tears of the Kingdom as well.

02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:27.800
Once again, thanks for the show.

02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:28.800
Great job, guys.

02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:30.800
Happy gaming weekend stuffs.

02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:31.800
Sincerely, Mishi.

02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:33.800
Aw, thanks for the email, Mishi.

02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:34.800
Appreciate it.

02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:36.800
That Sunhaven sounds super cute.

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:39.800
I'm all for Stardew Valley but with dragons and fairies.

02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:41.800
That's very much what we do.

02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:45.800
Those Stardew Valley games, there's a lot of copycat titles.

02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:50.800
I'm not using that negatively, but it's just, you know, sometimes when a game does very

02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:55.800
well you start to see some of the, you know, heavily inspired titles come out.

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:56.800
I hadn't heard that one.

02:22:56.800 --> 02:23:01.800
That one wasn't on my radar, but I'm all for the cozy games, that's for sure.

02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:04.800
Okay, so talking in the roundtable.

02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:07.800
We have No One Special 77s in chat tonight.

02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:08.800
Hello, hello.

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:14.800
Who says, who asks, I should say, is there any games coming out between now and quarter

02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:17.800
and 2024 that you're excited for?

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:18.800
Oh, boy.

02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:21.800
That's a loaded question, to be honest.

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:23.800
I mean, for me personally, I've made it no secret.

02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:26.800
I'm very excited for Final Fantasy XVI.

02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:31.800
And at the end of the year, I think Starfield I'm pretty hyped for at this point.

02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:35.800
I think there's enough there that I really am excited to see and want to check out.

02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:38.800
There's that as well.

02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:41.800
I feel like Nintendo will probably still announce something.

02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:45.800
We just don't know yet, but in the coming weeks, they'll announce a holiday game that

02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:48.800
I'm going to go, yep, I want to get that game.

02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:54.800
Speaking of Nintendo inspired games, that's Square Enix Splatoon knockoff with the foam.

02:23:54.800 --> 02:23:56.800
I can't remember the name of it now.

02:23:56.800 --> 02:23:57.800
That looked cute.

02:23:57.800 --> 02:24:00.800
And I might be interested in that if that makes this year, but I can't remember if it

02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:01.800
was this year.

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:02.800
Oh, no.

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:04.800
He said in the question, quarter one, 2024.

02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:08.800
So that means Final Fantasy VII Rebirth counts too, because that's supposed to be quarter

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:09.800
one of next year.

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:11.800
And I'm very hyped about that game as well.

02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:16.800
So I got a lot of great games to play throughout the year, and I still have a backlog.

02:24:16.800 --> 02:24:21.800
Like, you know, I have to admit for the first time in a long time, seeing that new Like

02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:25.800
a Dragon 8 trailer today, I was like, maybe I really do.

02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:28.800
Maybe Bobby Blackwell has a point when he says I need to go finish Like a Dragon.

02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:31.800
Like maybe maybe I should go back and bubble that back up.

02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:33.800
But see, here's the problem.

02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:36.800
And Bobby's admitted this is a problem for him on his show, too.

02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:40.800
So now I'm going to have to start from the beginning, because I'm going to feel like

02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:44.800
I forgot everything that happened at this point and have to start from the beginning.

02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:47.800
I probably don't have to, but I feel like I have to.

02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:51.800
So there's just that growing backlog of games to get through.

02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:54.800
Oh, Bobby points out there's a theater mode, so I could just watch the cut scenes.

02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:55.800
All right.

02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:56.800
That's clever.

02:24:56.800 --> 02:24:57.800
That's clever.

02:24:57.800 --> 02:24:58.800
I was going to joke.

02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:00.800
I could watch a speed run.

02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:02.800
Let's see.

02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:03.800
Let's see.

02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:07.800
SJ100Matt says there's so many games coming out, but not enough time to play them.

02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:11.800
Need a room of spirit and time to get through some of these.

02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:12.800
For serious.

02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:13.800
For serious.

02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:14.800
Oh, God.

02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:16.800
Now time in a bottle, though, is stuck in my head.

02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:20.800
Kind of a depressing little song.

02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:24.800
I'll give I'll give one more shout for our Discord green room if anyone wants to call.

02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:27.800
But otherwise, let me go to Loki and check in if there's a last minute story tonight.

02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.800
I feel like we hit on most things with the big announcements, but you never know.

02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:33.800
Yeah, we pretty much hit on most of those things.

02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:38.800
I would say the only detail that we've got now is Starfield is going to run at 30 FPS

02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:42.800
locked on consoles, so they're not going to be doing any sort of performance mode.

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:48.800
It's 4K on the Series X and 1440p on the Series S.

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:51.800
I'm a little surprised to hear they're not trying to push 60 frames.

02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:53.800
Yeah, at least on the console.

02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:56.800
Maybe PC, which is probably where I'll be playing it.

02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.800
So that's fine.

02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:00.800
Yeah.

02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:04.800
All right, we'll see what comes of that.

02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:05.800
All right.

02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:09.800
Well, with that, I think we are not getting any other calls or anything tonight, which

02:26:09.800 --> 02:26:10.800
is fine.

02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:11.800
We're at about two and a half hours, which is normal length.

02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:14.800
So we're going to move to wrap it all up for tonight.

02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:18.800
But before we do, I'll just say thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:19.800
Radio.

02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:21.800
Thank you for supporting independent podcasting.

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:24.800
If you enjoyed what you heard here on the show, please help us spread the word.

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:26.800
Tell a friend or two about the show.

02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.800
A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify goes an awful long way as well.

02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:35.800
I try to keep an eye on Spotify once in a while, too, for the people that actually respond

02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:37.800
to the, what did you think of this week's show?

02:26:37.800 --> 02:26:39.800
Because I saw one in the queue there that I pushed up.

02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:44.800
So if you say nice things, I'll bump up whatever it is you put in there, too, as long as it's

02:26:44.800 --> 02:26:46.800
somewhat relevant.

02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:47.800
So thank you to all that.

02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:48.800
I really appreciate that.

02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:50.800
And those all go an awful long way.

02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:52.800
So thank you, thank you.

02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:53.800
I think that's all I have to say.

02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:55.800
We'll be back in seven days to do it again.

02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:58.800
We have some more announcements we're going to be getting at Ubisoft, Capcom, who knows

02:26:58.800 --> 02:26:59.800
what else this week.

02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:02.800
Maybe Nintendo will surprise us, but I'm not going to hold my breath.

02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:05.800
But in the meantime, lots of fun games to still be playing.

02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.800
Ooh, as I transition it to Dark Sakura, I know she has a new Dead by Daylight chapter

02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:11.800
to play on Tuesday.

02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:12.800
That's something exciting that's coming.

02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:13.800
I do.

02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:14.800
Yeah.

02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:21.800
And they've already had to do some tweaks to it, but I'm really looking forward to learning

02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:24.800
the singularity, unlocking.

02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:28.800
I mean, to be honest, I still don't have my night adept and I haven't played him yet,

02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:29.800
but I did.

02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:39.800
I did get both Wesker and Skull Merchant done in four games each.

02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:45.800
I've seen people calling that new killer Larry because he's the singularity.

02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:53.800
Actually, Larry is what Shayla calls one of the crows because he's Larry Bird.

02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:54.800
Okay.

02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:57.800
But isn't there a streamer named Laurie Bird?

02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:01.800
I think there is.

02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:03.800
She actually stopped.

02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:04.800
Lady Burb.

02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:06.800
She actually stopped streaming.

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:08.800
Oh, I might be thinking of somebody else.

02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:11.800
But her husband is also Burb.

02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:12.800
Gotcha.

02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:15.800
And they call their kid Little Burb.

02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:16.800
Okay.

02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.800
And then what else am I going to say with that?

02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:20.800
Oh, the new survivor is very handsome.

02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:22.800
Very handsome fellow.

02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:24.800
Oh, Mr. Soma.

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:31.800
And there are, from what I can see, I think Felix is getting another shirtless look, or

02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:33.800
at least open-shirted look.

02:28:33.800 --> 02:28:38.800
For Pride Month, it's what we deserve.

02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:43.800
I want an ace character that isn't Ace Visconti.

02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:48.800
Although, wouldn't that be kind of funny if it was Ace?

02:28:48.800 --> 02:28:51.800
Our other nickname is Ass Discount.

02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:54.800
I love the way that Alan plays Ace Visconti.

02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.800
Have you ever played with him on Dead by Daylight?

02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:00.800
His steam name is Ace Visconti, but gay.

02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:04.800
And he plays with purple velvet pants and a leopard shirt.

02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:10.800
It looks like a 70s stereotype of somebody who was in a John Waters movie once.

02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.800
I've seen him do his cosplay before, too.

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:18.800
Now, my ace is really gross.

02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:29.800
He's kind of a lech old man who makes just enough money gambling to keep himself afloat,

02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:32.800
and he has a thing for college girls.

02:29:32.800 --> 02:29:33.800
Oh, boy.

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:34.800
All right.

02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:36.800
Well, on that Dead by Daylight fandom note-

02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:38.800
We have weird headcanons in the game.

02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:43.800
On that Dead by Daylight fandom note, I know you're off to go play and stream, so any final

02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:46.800
thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:50.800
I may have open lobbies, and if I don't get anyone to play with me, we may go ahead and

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:52.800
try another attempt tonight.

02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:53.800
All right.

02:29:53.800 --> 02:29:56.800
But you got to pay a lot for it to be nurse.

02:29:56.800 --> 02:29:57.800
All right.

02:29:57.800 --> 02:29:59.800
Well, have a good stream tonight.

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:05.800
I was going to say you, too, but probably you're going to Diablo, so bye.

02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:06.800
Bye.

02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:08.800
Have a good night.

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:10.800
That was a very safe bet she made there.

02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:11.800
All right.

02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:15.800
Actually, I have some 14 errors to catch up on, too, so it might end up being that.

02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:16.800
All right.

02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:18.800
Loki, what's your final thought for us tonight?

02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:22.800
I'm excited to go see Randy Feltface tomorrow.

02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:23.800
Who the hell is that?

02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:24.800
I've never heard that.

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:27.800
He is an Australian puppet comic.

02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:28.800
Oh, okay.

02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:29.800
And it's not like-

02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:31.800
Everything's funnier with puppets.

02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:33.800
Well, he is a puppet.

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:34.800
His character is a puppet.

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:39.800
You don't know who actually is voicing him, but he is hilarious, and I can't wait to see him.

02:30:39.800 --> 02:30:40.800
All right.

02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:41.800
Good times.

02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:42.800
Have fun at that.

02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:43.800
My final thought.

02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:45.800
Final Fantasy XVI demo tomorrow.

02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:46.800
Yes, I'll be streaming.

02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:50.800
I know I've been really bad at streaming, but man, being sick knocked me on my ass for

02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:56.800
two weeks, so strep throat, it happens, and then another something on top of that.

02:30:56.800 --> 02:30:57.800
I'm excited to get back into streaming.

02:30:57.800 --> 02:30:58.800
I'm really excited.

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:01.800
I get to play Final Fantasy XVI tomorrow.

02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:02.800
I'm so excited.

02:31:02.800 --> 02:31:03.800
That's it.

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:04.800
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:09.800
We'll be back in seven days to talk about XVI, whatever other games, Capcom, Ubisoft,

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:11.800
everybody else is set to announce.

02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:13.800
It's an exciting time in gaming.

02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:18.800
I hope you all have fun playing games, whether you're playing Diablo IV, Street Fighter VI,

02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:22.800
or something in your backlog from years ago, whatever it is, or you're just playing Minecraft

02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:29.800
again like Loki, whatever it is you're playing, have fun, enjoy it, and please be nice to

02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:33.800
people online, and stop making stupid people famous.

02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:35.800
Good night, everybody.

02:31:35.800 --> 02:31:40.800
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:45.800
