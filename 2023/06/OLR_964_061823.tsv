0	30000	Quote, General Manager, Rod Ferguson, We really wanted to ground Diablo 4 as much as possible. We've had some fun, but we wanted to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic, dark themes we had. End quote. There is no cow level. Also Diablo 4, for the low, low price of 100% of your daily sodium intake, you too can wield the Dread Pheasant Slayer or the Foul Reaper. This is the Gotta Get Paid update. Now it's time to get started.
30000	60000	It's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers and Loki to tell you more about this story and the rest of the week's gaming news. Starting right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
60000	90000	Our program for tonight, June the 18th of 2023. Not only did I mix up the numbers, but of course I mixed up the six and the nine. How nice. We love that here at Orange Sounds Radio. Please say hello to my co hosts with me here every week. I'm Rob Roberts, but they are DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi, how are you? I kind of heard a little bit right now. I had to go take something real quick. Oh, well, I hope you feel better.
90000	100560	I had a lot of rest yesterday. So I might have pulled something on my side a little bit. But that's why drugs exist. Yes, yes. Everybody, medical science is not out to kill you.
100560	121760	And as I was telling you before the show, I'm still not 100% from when I was sick after like Memorial Day. I'm still hanging on to a lot of that. So yes, Advil has been my friend, as has, you know, what is it just generic Sudafed or whatever. It's not I'm like, whatever top care is, I guess target or whatever brand that is.
122960	125880	Oh, boy. So you so you literally can't cry?
126720	143960	No, I cry too much. I either go from being like super dry and crusty to just tearing up really randomly. And we don't know what the cause of it was. It might have been related to allergy, pollen, something or the other. Could have happened when I was dealing with midness tooth.
144480	148120	Oh, interesting emergency dental surgery on the cat. Yeah, yeah.
148800	163120	The vet was like, okay, it came out. And she's like, we need to do extra. I mean, I can catch everyone up on Midna later, but it was just sick. Okay, well, that's how it worked. Yeah, cool.
163280	172880	All right, well, that's good. So now you can add dental surgeon to your resume. Let's see, ballet performer, dental surgeon, graphic artist,
174280	185280	videographer, part time killer in Dead by Daylight killer, sometimes survivor, Midnight Sun and cult leader.
185760	191680	All right. Well, speaking of cult leaders, help me also say hello to our other co host tonight, tech master, Loki.
192400	192800	Hello.
192840	194080	Hi, Loki. How are you doing?
194400	194960	I'm pretty good.
195000	215000	Good. Okay. So every week, of course, we broadcast on Twitch over at twitch.tv slash vog network. That's VOG network, Sunday nights at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Blackwell show. And if you watch us on Twitch, I mean, we are a podcast. But if you watch us on Twitch, you can see some of the fun things in our background sometimes, which includes what is this behind you tonight,
215000	217240	Loki? I don't recognize this and I feel like I should.
218040	228080	You should recognize it. It is a I don't even know if it's out yet. I think we just have a demo out for it. But it it is aptly appropriate that it's dad by the sword.
228400	239040	Oh, okay. It's because little father's day tie in. I see what you're doing there. All right. Well, happy, happy day to you, Loki. Did did the kids do anything to spoil you today, Loki?
240960	241440	No.
241480	244760	Did they behave themselves for a change? That would be a nice treat, wouldn't it?
245960	248360	No, I'm just I'm just teasing.
248360	261320	Happy to you and all of the feline and other animal parents out there. And that I know it's a it's also a really hard day for a lot of people.
261320	261640	Sure.
261640	262520	Myself included.
262560	263360	Sure, of course.
263360	285320	So just if you need to, if you need to stay away from the paternal holiday, you are absolutely welcome to, you know, we understand. So for anyone who is remembering one or, or not, I should say, I hope you have a good Sunday.
285480	302680	Yeah. And always an opportunity for me to say Happy Daddy's Day to all the daddies out there that I know and adore. So just, you know, and that has nothing to do with being a relative. Absolutely not. Let's see. Going to chat over at Twitch-
302680	305400	It involves leather and hair.
305440	332640	What? What? Of which I have neither right now. All right. Going to our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network. Jessica says my kids are animals, so I take both boxes. Well, happy day to you. And DJ Rama S is recommending or not recommending over the counter mucinex. It will knock you on your ass after the second dose. Yeah, I think that's a little stronger than what I need right now. Like I just still have like a lingering sore throat and sinus issues.
332640	348120	Honestly, mucinex is it's just an expectorant. Like, it's guafenecin, basically, which all that is, it's not going to like, make you hurt or make you sleepy unless it's got other stuff in it. It's literal guafenecin.
348120	360480	But there there is like, there's different types like there is for anything. There's certain different types that will absolutely knock you on your butt. But it's like it's that mixed with like NyQuil or something or I always
360480	371120	I always just go get straight up guafenecin if I need it. But if you if you are not coughing anything, you do not need an expectorant.
371720	394840	All right. Let's see. We should move on and get into games. I hope for those of you that are sick out there, I hope you feel better soon, for what it's worth. All right. Let's get to the latest and greatest in gaming news. We had some more press events this week that we want to talk a little bit about the news with. Loki, did you want to talk about this or you want me to do it or what?
395280	413640	Okay, cool. So we have Ubisoft and Capcom. We because we got a lot of news last week, right? Because we had, you know, Xbox, we had summer game pass. So we had a lot of game announcements. I feel like we didn't get as much new stuff out of this as much as we got deeper dives. We did get some new things, though. I'll let Loki handle it from here.
414040	427240	Yeah, some of the stuff we saw at the other events, especially for Xbox, you know, with the whole Star Wars outlaws thing, the reveal there. So we got a little bit of a deeper dive. They started off with
427240	452960	just dance. It's thankfully they kept it to like a very small, minimal showcase of people dancing. Like, does anyone give a crap about that? No, just say, Hey, you know what, it's another new year, we have a new just dance game. Here's some of the songs in it done. We don't need like a song and dance production over there. It's cringe. It's goddamn cringe all the time. Ubisoft get through your head.
453560	463480	I mean, I will say those games do sell or they wouldn't keep making them and they don't give me I get it. It's the over the top presentation. That's ridiculous. Like it's wasted money. Yeah,
463520	474680	like the the moms and kids that buy that game like aren't watching the Ubisoft forward. So nobody needs to see a song and dance to get hyped up about just dance because nobody is hyped up about just dance.
474680	480760	Yeah, show a 32nd commercial you plan to use before a movie or something, you know, like, that's the place where you advertise it.
480760	509520	Right, exactly. So like, I mean, it's fine. Unless you have like something really like unique, like this time is gonna be, you know, we're doing something different. But it's like, this time we have some more songs. It's the same thing again, but whatever. So we had the first look at Avatar frontiers of Pandora. So the first gameplay trailer from that very pretty looking game. I am not fully immersed in the Avatar universe. So it's alright.
509720	510840	But it's coming out this summer.
511800	518520	I was gonna say dark soccer, you were you were kind of into the Avatar stuff for a bit. I don't know if you still are, but I know you were for a bit. Is this something up your alley?
518520	539520	I think so if it's something that expands more on like, I guess the the built in culture of their universe. I have a big love for things like conlangs as in constructed languages. And, and fictional sociology, if that makes sense.
539760	540280	Sure.
540800	551400	So it's, it's stuff like that interests me. If it's anything that actually is as rich of an environment as the movies are, then I'm pretty down for that.
551440	552040	Yeah, I mean,
554040	555600	I just care about the blue people.
555760	585280	Well, yeah, and there's something about Avatar and to be fair, I never did see the sequel. I mean, one of these days, I guess, but there's something about Avatar where at least the first one that the the world and everything about it did seem very, like fleshed out, like for all the budget that movie had, you really feel like, you know, they weren't just making a movie, they were building a world, you know, and that part of that was, you know, actually having linguists coming up with the language kind of as you're talking about, and you know, that there's this whole
585280	597400	backstory. So it actually lends itself evolving. Yeah, and it lends itself very well to a game universe. Although I do recall that original movie had some tie in games that were kind of meh. But
597880	601720	I played one that was on PS3, PS2.
601760	602200	Yeah.
602880	603280	Yeah.
603280	604040	Yeah, it was fun.
604120	626400	Yeah, so but I'm curious what to see what maybe like the next gen and maybe a different developer kind of does for that whole sort of universe. It definitely lends itself well to a video game. But it's, it's very rare that this these days, it feels like that a movie gets a good video game tie in. I'm not gonna say always, but it just seems very rare these days. So I'd be curious for sure. So
627400	642840	looking in chat over twitch.tv slash a vog network, tiger class pointing out if I had Disney Plus, I could watch it actually got rid of Disney Plus, I found I had too many subscription services. So I pared it down. The only one I have right now is Paramount Plus. I don't even have Netflix right now.
643640	650440	I have my Apple TV account and which Rob if you use the OLR account.
651040	657920	Oh, oh, then will that get me? Okay, cool. I'll have to look into that. I'd like to see the Tetris movie. So yeah.
658920	671080	Well, I don't have it there. But I bought Super Mario Brothers and dragons. I've got a bunch of old movies to like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and I've got Paris is Burning and, and a few cultural.
671080	691000	Oh, well, we're talking about movies we bought I have clue the movie I bought I bought I bought clue the movie on Apple, whatever, whatever store, like, God probably like 1015 years ago, because I always wanted that movie with me no matter where I go. That was my reasoning behind it.
691880	712440	Actually, coming to look at it, I also have a bunch of scary movies. I have Barbarella, Villain's Headface, the magic music, Birdcage, Battle Royale, lots of good stuff. But I have a lot. This is what I went through my horror movie things. So I've got like the cube movies, you know, Dark City, Dark Water, a bunch of Digimon. Oh, my God.
713160	741720	Dark Soccer, I buy eight men out Dark Soccer, I might need you to take me take me on a movie date because there's a there's a horror movie I want to see. But I don't know if it's something up your alley. I want to see the blackening. And the reason why I want to see that movie is because it looks like it's bringing something back to horror that's sorely been missed for a long time for me. And that's camp. Because just watching the trailer, it looks very, very camp. And that's the stuff that I love in horror movies. So take me on a date Dark
741720	742280	Soccer.
746280	751320	Okay, I mean, apparently everyone is saying it's hilarious.
752520	756280	That's it. I like horror movies that are funny. That's it.
756440	757720	And I like the font.
758400	769680	Yeah. All right. Anyway, where were we? Oh, yes, Avatar. I don't know how we got from Avatar to campy horror movies. But welcome to Orange Songs Radio. Anyway, low key.
769680	799280	All right. So yeah, Avatar is going to basically be like Far Cry. And in the sense that you know, you have to take over outposts and all that fun stuff. So I don't know about radio towers in there yet didn't see those, but it's probably coming. We had a trailer for X defiant, which is coming out later this year. It's their PVP focus FPS game. And they're going to be doing some closed betas. They're going to be happening actually next week. So that's kind of neat.
799920	814080	They said that the release date for the game is going to be coming out later this summer. We got to see more of Prince of Persia The Lost Crown, which looks pretty cool. It's a that 2d action platformer game.
814440	817400	Trying to think of the last time I was hyped for a Prince of Persia game.
817640	819440	Yeah, I mean, it's it's
819480	823320	like, is it 1987? What's going on in here? But yeah, no, it looks great.
823720	853120	Yeah, so that'll be coming out in January on the 18th. And then we had the reveal of Captain Laserhawk a blood dragon remix, which looks like Ubisoft's version of Captain N. But that's being done by I don't remember his name is like Ari something that who did like all those like fan project movies. Like they did I know the violent like Power Rangers thing. But they also were behind the Castlevania animated
853160	868480	series that was on Netflix. So could be cool. It's supposed to be a throwback to 90s anime and stuff. So I mean, I'll check it out. I liked Blood Dragon. Yeah, I wish it was a game, though. But you know, it's fine.
868480	898440	We had Division Resurgence, which is a spin off of the Division and that's coming in the fall. Again, showing Skull and Bones. Like how many years we're gonna see this? Is it ever going to come out? I don't know. And they did like a sea shanty on stage. Once again, we don't need stage productions of stuff, especially when Skull and Bones like when you're initially revealing it. Cool.
898520	906320	When you're revealing it for like the fifth time. Not so much. But there is going to be a closed beta for it coming out in August.
906320	936160	So I did want to go back to a comment that Bobby Blackwell had said about these over the top reveals. He was talking about Just Dance, but I would assume it applies here too. He said the over the top presentation gets press coverage in mainstream media. We criticize the song and dance number years ago for E3, yet it was all over MTV News. That portion of their presentation wasn't for the gaming media, it was for the mainstream media. Like I get the logic there. But I also kind of think what Loki says about when it's like the third or fourth time. Like I do, I absolutely
936160	960640	remember, absolutely remember when Activision did this for DJ Hero. Remember that fucking concert they put on at Staples Center? It was like a bunch of A-listers. There was at least five A-listers that were performing at that event. What Bobby said, absolutely right. That was to get MTV News coverage and things everywhere else.
960640	975520	I just, you know, I think there is, you know, I get where Bobby's comments rooted in, but I think there's something about Loki too, when you're doing it for the 10th time, which, how many years have they done these Just Dance things? I don't know if it's as effective.
975520	997520	There's a new Madden coming out this year? Like, I didn't know. Like, I mean, it would be different if this was like the second game in the series. But they've been putting out games for that for like, ever. It's been out for a long time. So it's just, it doesn't seem like that's something like, oh, yeah, we put on the song and dance. So MTV would pick it up and play it or like some mainstream media.
997520	1000040	Like ABC, CBS, it's that type of stuff.
1027520	1056200	That to demonstrate Just Dance and he'd be like, I've never done this before. Even though like, you know, it's been out for 20 plus years or whatever. Yeah, it's a big waste of time. But whatever, you know, Skull and Bones, they're gonna do a beta in, you know, August. Cool, maybe someday will come out. Maybe someday someone will care about it. But yeah, that's, you can always play Monkey Island, you know, the crossover with with their pirate game. So
1057520	1082880	what else? We got an announcement. Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope getting DLC. I almost forgot that that game even existed. And oh my god, it's Rayman. He's going to be in the game. Cool. Then we had the crew motor fest, which is Ubisoft's I'm going to copy Forza Horizon game.
1082880	1095240	And last crew game I think did pretty well. Of course, they they kind of gave it away in a lot of those PlayStation Plus type promotions. But I feel like the crew did decently seems like so might have made some money on DLC to
1095240	1113880	Motorfest is supposed to be taking place in Hawaii. And it's kind of like Forza Horizon in that sense, lots of cars. It's gonna be out September 14. And apparently you also be able to import your car collection from the crew to if you happen to have played that game. So that's kind of neat.
1125240	1155080	coming out on the meta quest two and three and not the PlayStation VR two. So that's interesting. And that one you it's kind of a spin off of the series, you get to play as Ezio, Cassandra and Connor. And you go through different scenarios with them. So kind of covering those three games. And then of course, they showed that Assassin's Creed codename jade is in closed beta. And they revealed that it's going to be a mobile spin off of
1155080	1181880	Assassin's Creed. So you can check that out. What else? Oh, Assassin's Creed Mirage. That's going to be the brand new game set in, I believe, like Baghdad. And it follows Basim. And they should like some more gameplay for that and stuff. So, you know, definitely like Arabian Nights vibe there, which looked kind of cool. But to me, I mean, they all look the same.
1182440	1194120	And then finally, we got gameplay of Star Wars outlaws. And they kind of talked about how that game of play and it looked pretty neat. So yeah, check that one out.
1194120	1222160	Lots of lots of solid games there. I mean, it's a lot of stuff where I don't know if I their day one purchases for me, but they're things like I feel like I'll pick up down the road to fill in the gaps. Like, you know, I was surprised how much I liked Assassin's Creed Odyssey, honestly. So I in fact, I wish I had more time to go back and play it more thoroughly. There's too damn many games this year. But I'll check out Mirage eventually. I find I like Assassin's Creed games more than I thought I would, or used to, I guess really.
1222640	1252000	And they did they did show a lot this year. There were some things I was kind of sad that were missing from there. I mean, obviously, Beyond Good and Evil to, you know, we didn't see anything for that. And, you know, the trailer covering the misogyny and misconduct of their employees by ease. Come on, that was missing from the showcase altogether as well. I'm kind of shocked, but you know, still not addressing it, I guess in 2023. That just doesn't happen. Go watch her go play or just dance
1252000	1257560	game. You know, that one. That's something that they don't want the mainstream media picking up on. But you know, it's fine.
1257560	1287560	Okay. All right. Well, looking at chat over at twitch.tv slash VOG network, Quest Buster is kind of clarifying about Mirage. It is set in Baghdad during the Islamic Golden Age. So, you know, those, excuse me, Assassin's Creed games often have pretty cool settings to them. And you get a lot of history out of them recently. Like that kind of started not with Odyssey, but the game before it. Origins, I feel like kind of started the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, you know
1287560	1317560	like, you know, the more like, you know, like, the like, you know, the more like, you know, the more like, the more like, you know, the more like, you know the
1317560	1321080	originally I was like okay this is gonna be pretty grounded in reality and it's like
1322280	1329000	what we could also sell all this dlc that has really ridiculous stuff in it i do like money
1329640	1337640	let's do that all right let's talk about capcom uh capcom was one i actually didn't watch um
1337640	1342360	but we did have a breakdown of the showcase with that so they showed some more footage
1342360	1349960	of konnitsugami path of the goddess which looks very colorful and uh interesting so um that's
1350520	1356120	an action game running in the resident evil engine and we have uh megaman x dive
1357240	1365960	offline so it's a they said digital bank containing megaman x memories or there is a
1365960	1371800	digital bank contain megaman x memories as under attack and you have uh over 100 upgradeable
1371800	1375960	megaman characters to team up with in somehow save people i have no idea what the hell this is
1376600	1379080	but i like me some megaman x
1382920	1389160	resident evil 4 vr mode is coming to playstation 5 so they showed off some of that and so it's
1389160	1397800	going to be a more immersive version of the game and uh we had uh pragmata is uh being showcased
1397880	1402840	again and has been delayed i guess it's been a few years since we've seen this i didn't i
1402840	1409160	completely forgot about it but apparently they announced it back in 2020 okay the megaman game
1409160	1414600	did a little quick research on this this is just an offline version of what was a free to play
1414600	1421000	mobile game megaman dive uh it's going to be available on steam but it's also ios and android
1421000	1427400	so it's it's basically a mobile title so you know take that for what it is uh and then yeah there's
1428120	1433080	you know otherwise it does i mean it is you know kind of the side scrolly megaman you know x type
1433080	1443400	of gameplay but do keep in mind it was originally mobile for what it's worth um but yeah pragmata
1443400	1447240	looks cool i just don't know what it is and also don't know when it's coming out now so
1447240	1454440	i will worry about that closer to whenever its release is uh we have uh ghost trick phantom
1454440	1459720	detective the remaster getting a demo now so that's going to be out actually at the end of
1459720	1468440	this month on xbox one playstation 4 switch and pc and the demo i guess is available now so that's
1468440	1474280	kind of cool if you want to check that out uh paulo justice ace attorney trilogy was announced
1474280	1481320	uh it's going to be coming out early next year and also on most of the consoles and pc as well
1481320	1488200	so that's cool collection of the three ace attorney games there um oh yeah that's right
1488200	1495720	i sort of remember this a while back so capcom town was something i thought it was like they
1495720	1501960	said it's like a digital theme park i thought it was a website at one time um but it's something
1501960	1507160	that they still announced and uh talked about a little bit so it's like a thing that includes
1507160	1512760	a playable classic capcom games oh yeah this was linked in our discord it's really it's it's really
1512760	1517960	cool like um that you can play like the original mega man and you know rockman or whatever you can
1517960	1523080	you can play all that stuff which is cool i saw it was at street fighter 6 you can also play
1524040	1529640	like classic arcade games in there and stuff which is kind of cool because they were showing
1529640	1534440	i saw a video someone talking about it and like they're playing final fight in street fighter 6
1534440	1538360	that's pretty rad like i love when they throw in like free stuff like that that's pretty sweet
1538360	1542520	yeah capcom has usually been pretty good about their back catalog i mean every generation has
1542520	1547720	had like a capcom classics collection of some sort you know there's our capcom arcade collection on
1547720	1552840	the current gen which i never did get volume 2 did volume 2 even come out it had to have i think i
1552840	1560200	never picked it up unfortunately but uh yeah pretty cool um we got uh some more information
1560200	1567640	on exo primal so it's going to be coming out july 14th and launching on consoles and pc
1568280	1574280	uh launching game pass day one and of course we saw during the xbox showcase there's the whole
1574280	1578680	crossover between that and street fighter 6 i'm not sure that's coming right at launch or that's
1578680	1586040	shortly after um but you know it's an interesting looking game i guess um and then finally uh they
1586040	1593560	ended with dragons dogma 2 which i know is highly anticipated of course and looks pretty sweet nice
1593560	1599240	no word on when that is coming out uh let me get to some comments over twitch.tv slash vog network
1599240	1604680	yyr hello hello says uh about the mega man game it's at least nice that capcom is giving folks
1604680	1609960	a way to play that mobile mega man game after it shuts down yeah that's a good point you know there
1609960	1615400	are you know as much as i sometimes you know in mobile games there are some that have really big
1615400	1619160	followings um you know that would probably appreciate an offline game i think about like
1619160	1623160	gergalia lost and you know there was that game definitely had its fans and you know
1623160	1630120	obviously when it shut down that was sad so i i will appreciate capcom uh you know making that
1630120	1635160	type of forever version of the game available when they plan to shut it down not every developer
1635160	1640840	does that so um you know props to them uh many people talking about like the classic uh stuff
1640840	1646040	there um and dr c says the classic stuff in street fighter 6 is in the arcade when you go
1646040	1650440	online you can sit in a machine to play other people or there's another section elsewhere with
1650440	1656120	different capcom classic arcades that rotate every so often uh fifth dream says legendary
1656120	1661320	wings if you do the season pass thing so that's pretty cool i didn't realize that man i just
1661880	1666600	i have missed street fighter 6 if this was any other year those words would not be leaving my
1666600	1674040	mouth but it's it's a busy year we're catching up in 2023 from all these uh lockdown era you know
1674040	1680040	we're we're really getting i think the results of um lockdown production this year um this is very
1680040	1684840	very interesting to see just a lot of stuff coming in street fighter 6 is one of many uh games that
1684840	1693000	people very excited uh this summer all right well if that is it for capcom then i think we can take
1693000	1697320	a break from gaming news and talk a little bit about our gaming weeks because usually at the top
1697320	1701560	of the show we like to take a minute to ask the question how is your gaming week and talk about
1701560	1704920	the types of games that we've been playing this week so dark soccer i'll go to you how was your
1704920	1713720	gaming week it was all right um i played pinball lots of uh black knight and world cup um sort of
1713720	1723160	rage specifically for black knight um oh and had hiccups apparently um played uh some midnight suns
1724120	1732200	i played some dead by daylight played cult of the lamb um i'm still in that stupid wordscapes game
1732200	1739240	i like it it makes my my brain actually have to work for a little bit and otherwise i've been
1739240	1744120	just playing whatever comes in front of me how are you liking that new killer they released in
1744120	1749880	dead by daylight this week i haven't played it yet but i um adapted gabriel the first day
1751880	1761160	um we actually uh hold on sorry we actually um had a nice uh singularity who was just wandering
1761160	1766840	around apparently i was the chosen one you know what it is when you are the chosen one you live
1767240	1776120	you live everyone dies yeah and uh so we wandered around together and he shot me with little orbs
1776120	1782680	and i actually learned something though about the killer um thanks to one of mid skulls videos
1783880	1790440	where um the boost that he gets for having one of those little globs on people
1790840	1798120	increases per glob per person so it's oh i didn't know that oh wow it adds another like amount on
1798120	1802120	there and it's not in any of the official documentation but he tested it i don't know
1802120	1806760	if it's intended i don't know if it's gonna get patched out but um but otherwise i've also been
1806760	1813960	getting the legacy uh anniversary items just by logging in so although i forgot to log in yesterday
1815000	1818760	all right so i've got like the fourth anniversary shirt for claudette and
1819000	1828200	some other character stuff all right cool and i finally got my own wrecker uh a wraith outfit
1829720	1836840	nice yeah all right now i'm special we'll go to loki how was your game week um i just played
1836840	1841800	minecraft because i'm still working on minecraft stuff um i should have a new episode out tonight
1841800	1847400	or tomorrow morning because i'm editing it right now so it's all done built lots of stuff lots of
1848360	1855880	things um i did watch uh some of my serve mates playing a game on steam though called one arm
1855880	1861240	chef that looks pretty funny um it's a cooking game where you basically have to go around and
1861240	1864920	prepare things but it's one of those ones with like awkward controls that you have to like
1864920	1870280	pick up stuff carefully with your hand and do things but it looks like a lot of fun and it's
1870280	1875880	pretty chaotic it's kind of like that uh ready set cook but first person and you know with one arm
1876760	1884200	okay so i recommend it good party game all right uh fc100 matt says i really thought that mega man
1884200	1890040	minecraft stuff would be shown at the capcom show but it didn't uh no that's the thing they they
1890040	1894200	completely have forgotten about the whole contest they've already they've already started another
1894200	1901160	contest and i i will literally i vow i will bring it up every goddamn month on the 15th every single
1901160	1905400	month until they address it there you go it's still your discord get them it's just a locked
1905400	1909960	discord but like it's like well after the time that they would have advertised they already
1909960	1915720	started a new feature me minecraft like contest thing but now they're like reframing it though so
1915720	1920680	like before it used to be like oh yeah we're gonna announce winners now it's like oh yeah tag this to
1920680	1925880	be to have a chance to be featured on our site they don't like say oh we're gonna like do you
1925880	1930600	know winners it's just like oh we like your thing maybe we'll put it on our website so i don't know
1931320	1936840	but yeah they're irritating me at the very least like they said they would do it and there were
1936840	1945240	no entries i'm like okay you know no no worthy entries except for mine where's my shout out give
1945240	1951000	loki a shout out come on minecraft it's like it's never gonna happen it's too late that windows pass
1951000	1955960	now they're moving on to what was the new one that they had just uh recently that they did um
1955960	1963240	like a minecraft thing for it was um it's like some other like not that just the dragons because
1963240	1969000	they just have that too i don't know there's some other like animated series thing that they made
1969000	1975400	minecraft stuff where they just move it moved on so quickly so who knows all right all right well
1975400	1980680	my gaming week um been pretty predictable for most of you out there uh still continuing final fantasy
1980680	1985560	14 there was some new uh raids that were released uh in the last patch i finally got around to doing
1985560	1990600	those after shane nagged me enough to do them i was like okay sure i'll do them um and then
1990600	1997000	i've been playing diablo 4 as well uh continuing my progression there i'm level 54 now and i've
1997000	2001000	been experiencing some of the different stuff that world tier 3 has like the helltide events
2001000	2005560	and you know kind of pushing my way through some of the dungeons um so yeah i've been having fun
2005560	2010680	there i haven't been doing as much multiplayer as i was kind of hoping to do but um because i joined
2010680	2017160	a clan in the first couple days uh with one of my streamer buddies but um i i kind of get the
2017160	2021880	sense they've already moved on from diablo so i got to kind of look for maybe another group to join
2022440	2028520	uh see what to do there but um yeah otherwise uh i am enjoying still diablo 4 and you know there's
2028520	2033400	something very zen about clicking a bunch and uh you know slaying all those demons from hell it's
2033400	2039880	a lot of fun i'm playing a tornado druid for those that are curious um i will probably at some point
2039880	2045320	roll a hardcore character just to kind of say i did it and went through that progression
2045960	2051080	but with fall fantasy 16 out this week i just don't see that happening until probably season
2051080	2056360	one is when i'll get around to doing a hardcore run at some point uh speaking of fall fantasy 16
2056360	2061240	the much anticipated demo came out this week so i actually played that i did that on stream
2061800	2069320	uh this week and uh it was um it was quite the demo um i had used a comparison
2069880	2075560	that it was basically like episode one of a series and that's what it really felt like um it was
2075560	2082440	interesting because you had the two-hour prologue demo which had some combat in it it had like the
2082440	2087880	first little area in it and the tutorials but it didn't have a lot it was much more story-based but
2087880	2092120	i get it they were trying to you know set up the story and why things are the way they are and
2092120	2097320	this very very intricate flashback sequence i don't want to ruin it for those that haven't seen
2097320	2102440	it yet but it was it was very interesting um it was just basically like a playable episode of a tv
2102440	2108760	show and then there was a combat demo so after you beat the prologue demo you get like a 30-45
2108760	2114760	minute combat demo that takes you through a later dungeon in the game where you ultimately go up
2114760	2121080	against Garuda i mean it's in the demo um and you uh it kind of lets you experience a little
2121080	2127560	more advanced combat so you can see how the accessory rings can really simplify combat
2127560	2131960	and literally make it push x to win if that's what you want to play which you know no judgment
2131960	2138200	play the game you want to play another mode or you can have no assists and you have to dodge
2138200	2143720	everything manually and do this but i will say weaving in and out the icon ability like being
2143720	2148760	able to do like i kept saying falcon punch because titan has this giant rock fist that
2148760	2154840	goes like being able to weave in falcon punch and then like do garuda's claw move that's like a
2154840	2159400	bunch of rapid hits like being able to weave all that stuff in and out is really satisfying i will
2159400	2164760	say you know for all the apprehension people have about the action-based combat when the last time
2164760	2170760	final fantasy had turn-based combat truly was final fantasy 10 some might argue 13 was kind
2170760	2176600	of turn-based i don't think it was i think it was probably the closest uh we've had to that but um
2177800	2183640	i the action in 16 way better than 15 because i actually felt like i knew what the hell i was
2183640	2190200	doing and what was going on whereas in 15 as much as i was fine with 15 and i enjoyed my time with
2190200	2195000	the game i i did enjoy it enough where i i felt motivated to go through all the dlc but i enjoyed
2195000	2201400	the time enough of the game i felt like in 16 i was in control even though i was using the assist
2201400	2207240	to slow down the dodge so the only ring i used was the one where if an attack is incoming
2207240	2211640	a little ring comes up goes tick tick tick tick tick tick and you have that amount of time to dodge
2211640	2216840	so it helps you understand the dodge time frames better and it was great that was that was perfect
2216840	2221400	for me because it made it feel like i was in control but that i wasn't getting overwhelmed
2221400	2227800	with attacks either that i could i could still dodge attacks so um going to chat comments
2228680	2233960	sg100 matt says yeah that's got to be the most generous demo when rob streamed it he got three
2233960	2238280	hours worth of demo yeah because i also played about 45 minutes of theater them that night
2238280	2242120	and i think my stream was about three hours and 45 minutes uh when i was set and done because um
2242680	2248040	chrono uh chrono trigger part two music came out last thursday and i just got around to it this
2248040	2254520	week scar of time is finally available in uh theater rhythm and it's it's exactly everything
2254520	2261000	you were hoping for because that song is fantastic and our old credit music um is in there as well the
2261000	2269160	the little um do do two westerly wins or does it yeah far away that's it that that song is in there
2269160	2274520	as well but the original version not the the remix that was in there um questmaster says the icon
2274520	2278440	combat took a bit of getting used to for me but by the end of my time with it i was juggling
2278440	2283880	through the icon abilities to burst the boss down yeah same uh questmaster says your progress in the
2283880	2290680	demo will also carry over to the full game so there's also that yes and um it's interesting
2290680	2294440	because again i don't want to spoil too much of the demo for those who haven't seen it yet
2294440	2302840	but it does seem that point where the demo cuts off is very like definitive like they don't have
2302840	2307640	to carry over a bunch of data i'll just say it's a flashback so it's not like they have to carry
2307640	2312120	over a bunch of data into the live game because it's like here's a point where now you can pick
2312120	2317960	it up and go i think it's going to work a lot better than again 15 but remember 15 had that
2317960	2323480	movie kingslayer or whatever it was called nobody watched it and it will somebody i'm going to get
2323480	2328200	that email i watched it you're really ignorant okay i didn't watch it a lot of people i know
2328200	2332120	that played 15 didn't watch it because you know you put in the game you want to get going you
2332120	2338760	don't have to want to watch a two-hour prerequisite movie to do it so 16 kind of you know stepped it
2338760	2345880	up a little bit uh better there so all right um bobby blackwolf watched it of course i knew
2345880	2352680	somebody would say that i watched it but at least this one had playable sequences in it uh uh for
2352680	2358600	what it's worth and gave you and i did not even notice this until i saw a tweet about it earlier
2359560	2365720	but in that first area you play in the demo the little mobs you fight are little goblins
2366280	2371880	which okay but it's a throwback to the very first final fantasy those little goblins are the mobs
2371880	2377400	you fight right outside the original town so there's there's interesting tie-ins to the other
2377400	2382920	final fantasy games because there's a very very overt final fantasy 4 reference early on too
2383560	2389320	and uh it's but a lot of these things are like blink and you miss it types of things somebody
2389320	2396200	caught a final fantasy 10 reference that's really deep like it is literally the inflection of a
2396200	2402200	whistle that's given in the in the demo is mirroring what una does towards the end of
2402200	2407640	final fantasy 10 and like they did like the side by side and i was like dang those are some deep
2407640	2414120	ass cuts the other thing i'll say about final fantasy 16 though very clear from the very
2414120	2419880	beginning from the opening sequences of the game in the first 10 minutes this is an adult final
2419880	2428200	fantasy game with adult themes four letter words murder blood is all there very early on so the
2428200	2435640	whole game of chocobos a song of shiva and ifrit all of that appropriate to describe what's going
2435640	2440520	on in this particular game um that probably isn't going to sit well with some people because even
2440520	2445800	you know y'all know i don't love violence and i wasn't prepared for watching people get their
2445800	2451080	throat slit in the game that's that's something that happens and uh what i really was not prepared
2451080	2460680	for was chocobo violence and i was like okay i was not mentally prepared for that but here we are
2460680	2467560	so this demo definitely setting up m rating bolded underlined italicized
2468680	2474920	so there it is for some people they'll be they'll be thrilled to hear it but it's definitely it's
2474920	2478680	definitely going to be a different mindset for approaching a final fantasy game than some of
2478680	2483320	the previous final fantasy games i did enjoy it though like i you know as far as like taking the
2483320	2487720	episode one of a series approach it was definitely one of those things where it was like when it was
2487720	2495560	done it was like i'm ready to binge the rest you got me let's do it let's do it so but luckily
2495560	2502040	it's not a six-month wait it's a 10-day wait so they did a lot of things uh very well with
2502040	2507400	the demo we'll have to check it out i it's probably one i'm gonna have to pick up yeah
2507400	2512840	i didn't really care for 15 i got so bored at 15 i didn't like the switch up on like the action
2512840	2520360	combat but it's this has as much in common with 15 as 15 did with 13 like you know they're just
2520360	2526680	they're all separate and again the adult themes are really going to separate this one for sure
2527240	2534360	so uh yyr says has there ever been a final fantasy with an mm rating before i don't think so um but
2534360	2539320	i don't think there's ever been a final fantasy game with a quote that is fuck fuck fuck fuck
2539320	2543400	fuck fuck fuck fuck that is literally one of the lines of dialogue that's in the demo
2543400	2548760	granted they're running from a giant rock falling from the sky but that was a line in the demo do
2548760	2553880	you remember when you played are they sharing writers of the saint's row game i mean like it
2554600	2560360	sounds really bad do you remember it's actually it's it's extremely well acted and all that it's
2560360	2564520	it's it's but it's just like again you have to be kind of mentally prepared for it and the
2564520	2570120	demo sets the stage for that but do you remember when you played final fantasy 7 for the very first
2570120	2577800	time and in the opening intro section of the game uh barrett says shit and it's the first time
2577800	2581960	there's like a four-letter word that most people had seen in a video game i mean you may have seen
2581960	2589560	one but yeah okay imagine that like over and over and over again like you're like like because
2589560	2595160	remember when the first time you saw barrett say shit it was like oh edgy okay that was like the
2595160	2603080	final fantasy 16 demo was every scene oh oh oh oh there is the best line stitch your ass down in
2603080	2612840	that chair and drink your goddamn tea a line i still use to this day well you know you spoonie
2612840	2619880	barred one of the most epic like mistranslations yeah it was you son of a bitch in the original
2619880	2629240	yeah although that i i not quite what it originally was but yeah saying but it was the
2629240	2635560	closest translation exactly exactly uh dgrms says so does the final fantasy 16 demo need a fuck
2635560	2641720	counter uh probably probably it's uh the f word is going to be used very heavily in the game for
2641720	2649960	sure um i i i still i realize there's still a lot of um you know valid concerns about the diversity
2649960	2655000	in the game i get it i will say one thing i thought was interesting about the demo and
2655000	2659240	something you learned about the story and again i'm not going to excuse it but i will say i had a
2659240	2666440	oh moment with this the demo gets into the fact that there are people that have tattoos that are
2666440	2670360	like branded by icons or something i don't remember the specifics of it i'll let you play
2670360	2675800	the demo to find out but those people it's a very classist society and they actually use the term
2675800	2684280	enslaved to describe those people and so i was like okay there's an optic thing here that they
2684280	2690280	wanted to avoid i think there's still ways they could have got around it but there was a part of
2690280	2697320	me that was like i you know when i kind of heard that and i saw that i was like ah okay well i i
2697320	2703480	see what they were trying to avoid for better or for worse uh with some really bad optics in the
2703480	2709080	game um so again i'd like to kind of experience the whole game to sort of put my head together
2709080	2713560	on all that wrap my head around it um but that would i would just say that was something that
2713560	2717480	when it was revealed in the game that that was like a subplot basically i was like oh interesting
2718120	2723720	um uh also uh bobby also brings up a very interesting point and i've never heard this
2723720	2730440	before the final fantasy game and this is very interesting apparently when japanese folks played
2730440	2738120	the demo there was a complaint the lips don't sync up with the vocals which is interesting
2738120	2743000	because that's a complaint we've had for a long time the response from the developers the japanese
2743000	2749240	developers was the game was designed for english as the as basically the primary language so now
2749800	2756680	japanese players are experiencing what we've had forever with final fantasy games so
2757880	2765400	i i guess this whole european they're they're they are tying themselves to that that mountain
2765400	2771320	for what it's worth um so again i'd like to see the rest of the artistic choices in the game
2771880	2778280	um i hear you know again i'm trying to avoid spoilers but i hear the adult themes and some
2778280	2782920	dark adult themes don't stop with what's just seen in the demo and that's about all i'm gonna say
2783800	2789640	uh i'm curious to see i mean there's a lot of tv shows there's a lot of movies i watch that
2789640	2797640	have some very dark adult themes um i'm curious to see where it goes but um until i have a chance
2797640	2805000	to play the game start to finish we'll see we'll see um yeah bobby blackwolf says they even said
2805000	2809800	that the script was written in english first and then translated to japanese yeah and mike deft
2809800	2814520	points out they killed chocobos in the demo they absolutely do and it was one of those things where
2814520	2821880	i i wasn't prepared for that because again it's like the golden rule you don't kill a chocobo
2821880	2827560	right and it's it's one of those things where like in movies i'm like you know i don't love violence
2827560	2831880	but i don't particularly care if people get killed left and right and all this stuff i i get used to
2831880	2837240	it but the minute they show a cat in distressed i'm rolling up my sleeves ready to fight
2839000	2848840	yeah that's when i was watching uh the the autopsy of jane doe i was like no no and it's probably why
2848840	2853800	to this day drag me to hell is one of my least favorite movies ever yeah or stranger things
2853800	2858840	season three as much as i appreciate that shows strangers things there was that scene and i was
2858840	2866440	like oh oh no no no no the scene in shape of water that one didn't get me either yeah anyway
2866440	2873000	all right it was very quick and off camera so so that game is out god what thursday it's out very
2873000	2878040	soon it's 22nd so i'm not getting it digital i did end up getting a retail version of it
2878040	2881560	so i have to go run at lunch time to best buy and pick it up because i don't trust
2882360	2887080	a delivery service to deliver it on time so i decided i would just go pick it up at a mass
2887080	2891960	retailer at noon so i can go do it on my time uh and then i'll be ready to play after work so
2891960	2898040	that's between diablo 4 and final fantasy 16 that's going to be my next 30 days of gaming at
2898040	2904280	least so if you think loki talking about minecraft is a lot just wait just wait for me in these two
2904280	2911400	games all right moving on let's get into some gaming news and other things going on throughout
2911400	2919560	the industry this week so loki yeah so we've got news that the ftc is going to be temporarily
2920360	2930520	stopping or pausing i guess the merger of activision blizzard and microsoft so apparently
2930520	2936280	they are right now currently temporarily blocking the merger it was supposed to they're trying to
2936280	2941640	get it wrapped up in two weeks but now this new restraining order requested by the ftc would
2941640	2946120	prevent microsoft from closing that deal within the next two weeks and then there's an injunction
2946120	2953960	that would block the deal until ftc's legal challenge is completely resolved um and this
2953960	2959320	is also kind of um right now they said that the federal judge overseeing the case has
2959320	2965320	temporarily blocked the deal and now microsoft has until june 16th uh so that's already passed
2965320	2971000	to make its case uh while regulators have until june 20th to respond and a hearing will take
2971000	2978120	place on june 22nd and with microsoft prohibited from closing the the acquisition of activision
2978120	2984920	blizzard until at least five days after that ruling is issued so i guess we'll hear some
2984920	2991000	more news here in the next couple weeks yeah um you know obviously i had wanted to see this go
2991000	2996360	through it's interesting because activision is kind of like they were definitely prepared for
2996360	3000600	it and they're kind of all take or microsoft they're all kind of taking the approach of well
3000600	3005720	at least this gets this gets this hurt in court faster and we'll get to get through this and you
3005720	3010280	know figure out where we stand and so i'm kind of like you know what i can appreciate that approach
3010280	3016360	let's let's instead of this thing going on for years and years and years let's just figure are
3016360	3020840	you gonna let it happen or not let's get the answers sooner rather than later and if you're
3021320	3026520	not gonna let it happen let's get that why out there on the table so that we can all you know
3027160	3031320	be irritated with it or understand it or whatever happens with this and how they let
3031320	3038200	like these giant companies like warner brothers buy each other but this isn't gonna go through
3038200	3044520	like that's a little weird i know i again i and i've said this time and time again on the score
3044520	3048520	on the show i'll say it one more time i'm not a fan of the big fish consistently eating the
3048520	3053400	other big fish in this industry however in this particular circumstance i will take anything that
3053400	3058920	gets bobby kotak out of power um and i don't love that he's getting a settlement or he'll get money
3058920	3062840	at the end of the day unfortunately he's going to get that no matter what happens because that's the
3062840	3068920	fucked up world we live in so as long as his say as long as his word no longer means anything
3069880	3073880	in gaming that's what i want to happen most of all and that's why i support this merger that's
3073880	3078840	the end of that's it like i don't even need to consider any other fact other than that it takes
3078840	3084280	bobby kotak out of power and out of this industry that needs to happen yesterday therefore i support
3084280	3092600	the merger that's it yeah all right i would like for him to be never hired for anything again oh
3092600	3099800	i god yes i would like him to retire to a desert island and fade into obscurity and the back pages
3099800	3106920	of history books and that's on how not to run a business but that's you know wishful thinking
3106920	3115960	he'll end up on the board somewhere that would be great too all right let's talk about some twitch
3115960	3121240	drama that happened this week oh you know you know what live streaming culture it's a big part of
3121240	3126200	gaming culture and as we're going to talk about with the second half of this you know some of the
3126200	3132360	money that's involved is pro sports level uh so let's talk about the first half of this first
3132360	3136680	it has to do with the new program that twitch rolled out this week called the partner plus
3136680	3145800	program it would allow certain channels to get a 70 30 split on subs but as people were starting
3145800	3151400	to crunch the numbers they realized this is kind of open to a much smaller group of folks
3151400	3159160	than it really seems like because to be eligible for partner plus you have to maintain at least 350
3159160	3164360	recurring paid subscriptions gifted and prime ones do not count
3166520	3173400	on paper before you all jump down my throat i want to say i understand where twitch got this
3173400	3179880	from because it's that key word recurring because that is how a lot of these companies not just
3179880	3186200	twitch but your local gym your local subscription service that you forgot to cancel that's how all
3186200	3192280	of these pocket your money is through these recurring subscriptions so from that end i
3192280	3196440	understand why they're differentiating it from gifted subs and the other stuff
3197080	3201560	but as somebody who is a content creator and supports my friends who also content creators
3203080	3208280	you almost make way more money off gifted subs and these other things than you do recurring
3208280	3215480	subscriptions so this is a very high bar to me that's very just very deceptive you get only do
3215480	3221880	oh i've gifted oh you make more money off gifted subs and that stuff well i mean and really the
3221880	3228200	only time i see gifted subs is if i'm doing a subathon i mean i have some i have some recurring
3228200	3236360	yeah but um but like if i have a subathon then then yeah it's gonna way outweigh you know see
3236360	3241640	typically the only way that i get actually i'll take that back right now on average i get more
3241640	3251800	from my regular subscribers and i i thank every one of you and could use more um but but i'll get
3251800	3257880	this like even if i'm not doing a subathon or something i'll get this big patch of donations
3257880	3266840	which i i love too and that will end up being as much if not more during those bursts of donations
3267560	3272920	um the reoccurring subs though are are the constant you know the ones you can depend on
3272920	3279800	yeah so they were saying well i was gonna say too with that um that one of the content creators i
3279800	3285640	follow from twitch paladin amber made some comments regarding this whole deal anyway she's really
3285640	3290440	funny i like her yeah saying she's all this she's all fuck it this was a secret deal that they
3290440	3295240	offered other streamers if you hit this quota for three months you got the deal indefinitely now
3295240	3299480	they've added a cap to that time period of 12 months meaning that every year you have to hit
3299480	3305160	this economically unless you're sitting at around thousand viewers or more this is so unattainable
3305160	3310200	right now based off of the individual and reoccurring subs not gifted not prime people
3310200	3315400	cannot afford to sub people are canceling their subs due to financial reasons and this doesn't help
3316200	3323320	so yeah it's ridiculous well and you know what twitch also is something that they're doing that
3323320	3330360	isn't particularly helping but they're starting to amp up their promo of twitch turbo which again
3330360	3336520	i understand twitch is a business that wants to make money there but these twitch turbo if you
3336520	3343880	buy this you remove ads from the entire platform and that's fine and good but that's usually the
3343880	3349400	biggest reason to sub to a channel too so twitch is putting out a product that's effectively
3349400	3357320	competing with their content creators so that alone is a little bit kind of you know wacky
3357320	3362200	so i just i think there's just kind of like this general attitude of like stop putting out these
3362200	3367000	things with all of these rules and restrictions and so forth just make it across the board
3367000	3373000	make it consistent make it fair you know even if it's only like 55 45 at least it's something
3373000	3377800	you know or what have you it's a bump up i think i'm not sure who they're trying to placate with
3377800	3385320	this because it's more people finding out how they don't fit into this and for all the promotional
3385320	3391480	push they were doing with this all it left it left the vast majority of twitch content producers
3391480	3396600	feeling i don't fit into this in one way or another i'm an affiliate it doesn't matter
3396600	3401480	i don't i make most my income off gifted subs it doesn't matter or someone like so basically twitch
3401480	3408920	did this big announcement for people to realize wow i'm not getting this and then on top of that
3409480	3415320	every repost i saw was people saying this isn't for me yeah right and on top of that you have
3415320	3420680	large creators that are getting these large money deals from kick whether that's a good platform or
3420680	3426280	not it's i guess headed up by crypto gambling bros so who knows well since you brought it up
3426280	3430760	let's talk about that end of things real quick here let's talk about that so we can talk about
3430760	3436520	the big picture here and that is of course one of the prolific twitch content creators xqc
3437080	3443720	has signed a 100 million dollar deal to start streaming on kick interesting things about this
3443720	3449640	agreement it's technically not exclusive um and so he's still allowed to produce for other platforms
3449640	3455720	including twitch if he really wanted to um and uh it's 70 million over two years but there are
3455720	3459800	incentives that would push this that's where the 100 million actually comes from but still
3459800	3464680	i think many of us are sitting here going god if i made one million off of playing video games on
3464680	3469480	the internet that would change my fucking life so xqc making a hundred million seventy million
3469480	3476760	however you want to slice it with this deal is a pretty big deal but then it also causes people to
3476760	3483320	kind of look at but what is kick anyway you know and so we've been talking for a long time about
3483320	3489080	twitch really needs somebody to compete with it and yes youtube does but there's always this
3489080	3496280	weird distinction where like youtube's live stuff is not as strong as twitch is sorry i just even
3496280	3501160	as a participant and i know people that have moved from twitch to youtube and i just i enjoy the live
3501160	3507000	experience on twitch better but the on-demand experience on youtube far better than twitch
3507000	3511240	which i'll never understand why twitch literally walked away from the on-demand thing but that's
3511240	3518360	i digress so to me those platforms are very different kick is really trying to clone twitch
3519080	3529000	but what's backing kick uh the ceo and co-founder ed craven is also the co-founder of steak.com
3529000	3537720	it is an online crypto casino uh from curaçao so uh it's it's a lot of crypto it's a lot of gambling
3537720	3544040	in fact if you don't believe me here i am i'm i'm gonna i'm having a fuck it we'll do it live moment
3544040	3548760	i don't know what i'm about to see but i'm doing it i went to the kick site right now look at that
3548760	3551960	i'm showing kick on twitch i hope i don't get busted but i'm doing it for the purposes of
3551960	3557000	commentary and i just want to show look at this top three streams right now this one in the third
3557000	3562920	slot slots and casino the ones being recommended to me over here two out of the five slots and
3562920	3570600	casino second highest category slots and casino third highest category pools hot tubs and bikinis
3570600	3578440	to put it in perspective you have 77 000 just chatting plus another 12 000 we'll say 19 000
3578440	3587000	we're going to generously say 100 000 people on kick not watching video games the highest
3587000	3593160	video game content on kick right now call of duty war zone 5 000 viewers
3595960	3603800	there's something there there's a certain air of if something is too good to be true it probably is
3604600	3611800	about kick that i can't shake now look cue cue somebody playing this clip to haunt me in 10
3611800	3617240	years when you know i've decided to start a kick channel or whatever you know but as of today
3618680	3624520	kick really feels like something where there's not an adult in the room i i'm just that is
3624520	3628760	honestly my impression of kick i mean what their their point is and then of course there's so much
3628760	3636280	room for abuse yeah well then you have like adan ross is also part owner backing they have him on
3636280	3641880	there which he's trash and then um was the amaranth apparently got a deal with them now yes yeah
3642680	3647000	um i mean there's certainly the audience that they're going for it's like kind of like the
3647000	3654120	the wild west version of twitch but we'll see how that pans out like it's it may work now that
3654120	3659880	they're small but you know once it blows up or if it gets any bigger like i i don't know it's
3659880	3664360	gonna be hard to be a legitimate platform but twitch is certainly making competition easier
3664360	3668120	right now because of their all their bad deals that they're making so yeah but this is gonna
3668120	3674040	this is gonna force twitch to you know step it up so to speak um so it'll be it'll be interesting
3674040	3681000	to see the ripple effect this has so for that and i'm i'm i guess grateful to kick for putting out
3681000	3687720	things out there that i really do think a 95 5 split i i again if something sounds too good
3687720	3695080	to be true it probably is and this whole thing just reeks of something's something doesn't add
3695080	3702120	up so the math's not mathing maybe it'll be maybe it'll be fine today maybe it'll be fine for a year
3702120	3709240	but i don't know when i think i would like to see a twitch competitor i think of beam mixer that i
3709960	3715480	i you know rip mixer to be quite honest i still to this day don't understand why i do understand why
3715480	3719560	microsoft pulled the plug i wish they hadn't i really wish that i wish they hadn't bought
3719560	3724760	them in the first place to be quite honest but i digress i see them uh that's why i see xqc taking
3724760	3730600	a deal like this because he's like yeah they may go under cool you know whatever i get paid though
3730600	3738440	so you know that's fine yeah he's probably looking at what happened to ninja yeah but anyway why are
3738440	3744360	these people why are these people so goddamn famous like i i know i'm like i i'm sorry to
3744360	3751240	sound like okay boomer but i it's a serious question like i hasn't this guy kind of put his
3751240	3755560	foot in his mouth quite a bit i guess that's what people like about him i don't know sometimes
3755560	3761160	controversial people are famous i guess for whatever reason it's weird to to do the classic
3761160	3770120	quote of justification he says what he means oh boy uh okay lots of content yeah no i get it
3770120	3775080	there's a lot of folks in chat lighting up about this uh lots of strong feelings on kick there
3775080	3781080	let's see uh comments dj rama s says kick is basically the man show as a streaming site
3783880	3788840	oh that's funny honestly i feel like they would print that on the back of the box
3789080	3794440	dj rama says kick is also full of right-wing people too tiger claw says i heard kick is
3794440	3800440	all about free speech bobby blackwolf says kick is free speech absolutionists sjo another matt
3800440	3805320	says tell me you're not run by dude bros without saying you're run by dude bros yyr says i heard
3805320	3809880	that kick basically has no moderation like it's the equivalent of what muskrat is trying to turn
3809880	3816360	twitter into they say it's free speech except it winds up just being a hellhole well the thing is
3816360	3821800	is that a lot of those people will say will claim free speech when they what they mean is hate
3821800	3832760	speech so so i i it's it's gonna take some very different type of signings to get me interested
3832760	3841560	into in kick i'll just say that so um but i guess have fun and thanks for maybe making twitch sweat
3841560	3847720	a little bit um because the competition is healthy at the end of the day but um there's
3847720	3852760	really nothing on that platform at this time i'm interested in viewing and that's that i mean if my
3852760	3857080	mind changes my mind changes maybe they bring somebody in from the outside who maybe they bring
3857080	3861560	an adult maybe they decide you know what we need an adult to clean this up and if they do it then
3861560	3867960	maybe it'll change so i don't want to own these words forever but as of today no thanks i got
3867960	3877240	better things to do um i i honestly though think that one thing that uh that twitch really needs
3877240	3887800	to do though is pay attention to to what their users are saying you know they're it's not wise
3887800	3894680	what they're doing it's going to be poor business in the long run right so all right all right um
3895160	3899720	let's uh move on to our next story before i get to that actually dark soccer i wanted to
3899720	3906280	because yyr is in chat and we do appreciate yyr we we we like him an awful lot and appreciate
3906280	3911800	him being here and as we know yyr is also a hard-working indie game developer um just like
3911800	3918680	loki uh and uh yyr made a game a couple years ago that we absolutely loved called super multitasking
3918680	3922760	and he was giving us a little update on super multitasking in chat and i just wanted to share
3922840	3927880	he's finishing up the new single player mode called gauntlet rather than slowly build up
3927880	3933640	and then kick you out after one mistake gauntlet consists of five 30 second rounds that are intense
3933640	3937720	throughout and if you make mistakes you get to keep going so it sounds like a very kind of
3937720	3941640	different mode to play in that particular game there so again if you haven't checked out super
3941640	3948760	multitasking it's like worry aware but like even even harder to juggle so uh check it out it's a
3948760	3955080	lot of fun and very addicting available on steam and i believe itch.io um if i'm wrong on that i
3955080	3961400	will be corrected shortly in chat uh but steam for sure so all right uh let's move on i'm gonna
3961400	3965800	take a quick afk uh real quick but uh dark soccer if you'd like to tell us about what we have to
3965800	3976200	look forward to yeah sure so um there is a new little kind of new visit in town it is the nintendo
3976200	3985560	summer of play tour so um we are going to be seeing them going to some major cities um from

4156280	4160600	i forgot about that nintendo world event that's going to be interesting yeah
4163880	4167960	do we have to wait until then to hear what's coming out for the holiday i feel like we might
4168760	4171640	it's very interesting how nintendo does that these days so
4171640	4176520	all right and i don't think i i sat down while you were reading the dates but i don't think i
4176520	4182760	heard a single one of those near us i think the closest one you said was la all right well maybe
4182760	4187080	they'll add you know san francisco or something in the bay san jose or something at some point
4187080	4194920	but all right until then uh loki what do you have for us uh yeah we have the uh announcement that
4195080	4201320	announcement that basically microsoft is no longer developing for the xbox one console
4201320	4204520	because you may remember that a lot of the games that they've been developing
4204520	4208680	have been backwards compatible with the xbox one in the sense that you could buy
4208680	4216760	for one system and it will play on the series s x or the one well now to be able to create
4216760	4223000	higher fidelity games and all of that stuff now they're not going to be focusing on the
4223000	4229880	xbox one and the games coming out will technically be playable on um the x and s however they said
4229880	4235720	games are technically playable on the xbox one via streaming so you'll be able to do it like
4235720	4242280	digitally i guess that way or through um xcloud but they won't natively run on the system which
4242280	4247880	i mean it makes sense i mean like god like how long can they really support that system how long
4247880	4252520	i mean it's been a long time since that's been out so yeah they weren't gonna i mean this is
4252520	4256600	a long time for them to have supported the previous generation so it's not completely
4256600	4261240	surprising technically being supported it's just like hey okay this comes this little console can't
4261240	4266200	run these games anymore and you know to make it a little bit easier on developers and having to
4266200	4273800	like run it for like support such a wide variety of you know specs it's just now you will do it
4273800	4278360	through streaming instead well yeah and the cloud gaming thing is an interesting little twist with
4278360	4283320	this because we knew that you know microsoft was really going this direction and so you know they
4283320	4289960	want any microsoft device to be able to hook up to streaming and play games can't even the xbox 360
4289960	4296200	do streaming i thought it could i thought they put a player out on 360 i could be wrong but you know
4296200	4300520	you shouldn't you shouldn't need a very complicated device to do the streaming end of things but what
4300520	4304760	you need is internet bandwidth and that whole thing you know and that's still going to be an
4304760	4309480	issue for some people although you know it depends on what resolution you're streaming at you know if
4309480	4316280	you're only streaming it like you know regular 720 hd type are you know very it might not be uh quite
4316280	4321800	as much of a hog on your bandwidth as you think um but you know that's one of those things that
4321800	4325160	will probably have to be addressed as more and more stuff goes through the cloud okay
4325160	4329560	thanks yyr clarifies in our chat 360 cannot do game streaming i thought that was something they
4329560	4334360	were gonna they were trying to do at one point um was to you know try to put streaming on as
4334360	4339720	many devices as possible which would be smart but it is what it is uh and yrs says it's been
4339720	4345080	10 years i'll have that built in well they're trying to put it in more TVs so you know that's
4345080	4348920	that's where microsoft wants to go they're putting a lot in the cloud you know that's what got them
4348920	4357080	in trouble with the merger over overseas it's too much in the cloud so but then but then interesting
4357080	4360680	didn't we get the news on another note it's not in our show world but didn't we get the news
4360680	4365400	that like sony said that they're exploring cloud stuff more for their first party games and this
4365400	4370120	or like more releases that come out they're exploring the cloud gaming with so it's like
4370120	4375640	they waited for this ruling to come in before saying that this is very strange yeah i mean
4376600	4383800	i don't know it yeah wow yyr points out that netflix disney plus and other apps for 360
4383800	4390040	were all discontinued well rest in peace xbox 360 i guess i mean i get it i just i feel like
4390840	4398200	you know what it's it's like um stadia on a chromebook you know rip but that was the big
4398200	4403320	selling angle was that you can play this thing on a relatively weak device i would have thought
4403320	4407320	they'd include the 360 in that but i guess maybe it's too old push that too like because they have
4407320	4415800	now um minecraft runs on a chromebook type thing yeah um yeah i mean i still think a chromebook
4415800	4422280	could probably do like game streaming as well but who wants to just buy a chromebook like
4423080	4426680	unless you're like what's something you give to a kid or you know student or something like that
4426680	4433160	you know i would waste the money i'd buy it i don't know i mean i have i bought my kids gaming
4433240	4437560	laptops because if they're gonna have a laptop i'm not buying them a piece of garbage laptop
4437560	4443720	that can't do anything so yeah all right well you know what you don't need a very good system to
4443720	4451880	play this next game and this is definitely from the school of wtf lol bbq uh this is a new game
4451880	4456520	boy color game that has been released we can't make games for the xbox one but we can make them
4456520	4464440	for the game boy color and this is a mcdonald's based game this is mcdonald's very blunt and very
4464440	4471000	uh transparent attempt to do as much viral marketing as possible for bringing back grimace
4471000	4477160	from the mcdonaldland gang um as they're celebrating grimace's birthday uh celebration
4477160	4482040	i think there's a new shake or something like that i don't know but uh they actually doesn't
4482040	4487800	make you grimace there it is literally a purple shake um i don't know if i don't know what flavor
4487800	4494600	it is i assume grape what other purple flavors are there i i don't know so that sounds really
4494600	4498040	awful somebody in chat will have to tell me because when i go to mcdonald's and order a
4498040	4501240	drink i usually get the coffee because it's actually not bad but it's because they do it
4501240	4507480	dunkin donut style where it's like half half creamer but anyway um grimace's birthday is a
4507480	4514040	game that they have developed for the game boy color it was developed by cruel toys that's krool
4514760	4519160	and you can actually play this on a browser if you want over at grimace's birthday.com i cannot
4519160	4523720	believe i just gave mcdonald's free advertising here on the show but hey it is what it is they
4523720	4528680	did this type of thing to get this type of coverage right uh so anyway uh some people
4528680	4534760	have actually gone into the site and pulled the rom out and it will actually run on actual hardware
4534760	4539800	if you use an everdrive or something like that to actually play the game i kind of wonder if maybe
4539800	4544040	this game was developed at one point and then stopped and now they picked it up again i don't
4544040	4549640	know but maybe not it was developed by cruel toys is the company that developed it so it was
4549640	4554200	developed by somebody yeah i thought maybe maybe back in the day there was a game boy game that
4554200	4561960	started and then didn't finish but i guess i guess it's nothing nice like that so yeah king k rule
4562840	4569160	uh pod culture says mixed berry i don't know if that was the grimace shake flavor or if it's
4569160	4574840	another purple flavor yeah but either would work it's vanilla and berry or whatever you know now i
4574840	4580760	feel real bad that i didn't like try to cash in on some sort of like fast food uh tie-in with my game
4580760	4588360	i mean i got probably uh teamed up with chipotle i mean it makes you shit so i guess you know that
4588360	4594840	would have worked but oh well you know too late now honestly it would have worked with um
4595640	4602120	mcdonald's as well yeah any fast food i'm still open for negotiation any fast food company out
4602120	4609240	there i will sell cheap you should hit up arby's they're very edgy on social media
4610920	4615320	absolutely your game would work although you're gonna owe yyr some profits off that i hope you
4615320	4622040	know that's fine and to be honest i think dark soccer also had some of the idea concept with
4622040	4631160	that so you're buying us all some uh happy meals yeah yum all right yeah
4634040	4638200	dj rama s in chat says you must defeat the hamburglar to stand a chance that was the
4638200	4643880	thing i was saying what's up with the mcdonaldland reboot like i remember when the whole thing on
4643880	4648520	social media and this was not that long ago this was maybe like seven years ago the whole thing
4648520	4654920	was oh no the hamburglar's hot do you remember this they like recast the hamburger like seven
4654920	4660600	years ago and like he was fucking hot well why are they even bringing back grimace when i thought
4660600	4666200	they got rid of ronald mcdonald's so what the hell is like none of the universe makes any sense
4666200	4673800	anymore it's like well he's too ronald mcdonald's too creepy giant purple thing not so creepy let's
4674360	4680680	do a birthday game for that okay wait i have to show this sorry it's uh how do we get other
4680680	4687800	screen here there it is uh this was from 2015 so this was this was about eight years ago there it
4687800	4697080	is the hamburglar as cbc news says a strangely attractive suburban dad where was that guy's game
4697080	4705720	i mean just asking i is certainly more attractive than the other hamburglar so i'm gonna say that
4705720	4713800	if if we're going to put the you know the characters of mcdonald's on a fuckability list
4713800	4720520	that hamburglar probably pretty high on the list yeah uh right up there with uh what's birdie
4720920	4736120	that's a child jokes people jokes all right anyway um let's see uh what is it pirate poundtown says
4736120	4741960	i suddenly want to buy a mcdonald's so it worked i guess it did sure did uh deejiram says two words
4741960	4747640	colonel sanders yeah uh i remember when reeba mackintosh played colonel sanders that was the
4747640	4753160	best one right there so anyway i remember when we had colonel colonel sanders near me
4753160	4759080	like they're all closed now i fucking forgot i gotta go to kfc to get the diablo food
4760200	4762840	i want my bird staff or whatever it's called in the game
4763960	4771960	bird staff all right it's it's all like the foul presence it's all these fucking puns on the kfc
4771960	4780040	menu it's it's ridiculous anyway let's see uh deejiram s and chat says my brother in christ you
4780040	4785880	should see the fan art of the fast food restaurant mascots excuse me you will clutch your pearls
4787000	4791960	where am i going to see it because they all they all protested on reddit so i i thought that's
4791960	4797880	where all the the the shocking shit on the internet was was on reddit i don't know twitter
4798440	4805400	all right anyway uh let's move on uh more news to make you grimace uh dar sakra
4806920	4814760	so um for fans of the soul caliber franchise uh soul caliber 5 will be delisted uh for uh
4814760	4825480	playstation 3 and xbox 360 um i mean it is kind of old um but uh after june 19th so for us in the
4825480	4834520	us tomorrow the game and its dlc will no longer be available for purchase so oops um and i made
4834520	4838680	a mistake because i was watching the trailer again and i accidentally paused on valdo's butt crack
4840040	4846520	and i'm traumatized now um i mean it was a really it was a really good game so caliber
4846520	4852200	six though was better yeah but it really did kind of drag it back to where they wanted the franchise
4853160	4858680	five for me was one of the weaker entries in the series but you know i was more surprised with the
4858680	4862840	whole like why is it getting delisted and the only thing i think of was it has must have to
4862840	4868280	do with the ezio the guest character in five and maybe some type of license but it's not it's more
4868280	4873160	like 11 years at this point not 10 so i was trying to figure out like what is it that they lost in
4873160	4878600	that game it has to be the ezio licensing or something um why they're having to delist it
4878600	4883400	but if you know what used copies of that game about to go up in value because now you can't
4883400	4889000	get a digital so there is that if you have a uh a disc copy of soul caliber five you know hang on
4889000	4892280	to it because that's the only way you're gonna be able to play it now because they can't take the
4892280	4898200	disc from you but they can pull it for the digital storefronts so yeah i think i've got one like
4898200	4903000	laying around somewhere i know i feel i'm like i have one in my giant stack of like playstation
4903000	4907400	three games somewhere because it was a p wasn't that a ps3 game that was a ps3 game not even four
4907400	4915720	right yeah yeah yeah that's what i said yeah it all blurs together sometimes all right uh moving
4915720	4922280	on uh loki yeah so the embracer group now is going they've announced that they're going through
4922280	4929080	a restructure and layoffs as well as studier closures are coming uh this is i think from a
4929080	4933640	two billion dollar acquisition deal that went through they were supposed to be purchasing
4933640	4941000	something and um well it didn't work out so uh they said embracer currently engages close to
4941000	4945880	17 000 people and while that number will be lower by the end of the year that's a fun way of saying
4945880	4952840	you're a layoff people it's truly too early to give an exact forecast on this um because the
4952840	4959160	reality is the quicker we act the sooner we'll merge as a stronger company i'm not sure which
4959160	4965640	studios are looking to sell off uh volition um are you saying that the heist and the hazardous
4965640	4974280	didn't bring you out of like out of the red into the black or whatever um like i thought for sure
4974280	4981960	that would turn that game around that awful piece of crap game around but yeah um you know this was
4981960	4986440	a company that like they kept making acquisitions and i don't think they were necessarily on strong
4986440	4991000	ip but we'll have to see what they're going to do it says the actions will include but not limited
4991000	4996360	to closing or divestments of some studios and termination or pausing of some ongoing game
4996360	5001320	development projects yeah cut your losses while you can't say it's real well i just i feel bad
5001320	5007880	for the people whose jobs are affected you know from this big fish getting too big it does suck
5007880	5012200	yeah it says we'll also decrease spending on non-development costs such as overhead and other
5012200	5018120	operating expenses we will reduce the third-party publishing and put greater focus on internal ip
5018120	5026200	and increase external funding of large budget games i did i did notice the tomb raider team
5026200	5031240	went out of their way to come out and say we're not affected by it well duh yeah i mean out of
5031240	5037880	like you know out of the the different studios i mean i guess gearbox entertainment's pretty big
5037880	5044280	um but you know out of those i think crystal dynamics yeah it's pretty solid like their games
5044280	5050200	make money well they did do the avengers which wasn't so well received but i don't think that
5050200	5055480	was their fault it was good that's that that's the more screen that was that was definitely
5055480	5059560	a business decision that was that was decisions that were forced into that game that made it bad
5059560	5064600	i don't think that was crystal d's fault i think that was executive pressure fault yeah
5065240	5070760	all right well hope it we'll have to figure out what happens uh we'll get some more details i'm
5070760	5075160	assuming once layouts start happening i mean because people aren't going to be quiet about it
5075160	5080200	yeah but that's that's still really sad so hope everybody lands on their feet soon or we see some
5080200	5086200	really strong indie games and new studios formed as a result as sometimes happens with these
5086840	5092360	stories all right uh let's talk about some rumors that are going around but we're actually going to
5093240	5098040	shut them down and this is the deal uh there's a rumor going around that illumination universal
5098040	5103640	and nintendo are about to sign on a legend of zelda film deal which would make a lot of sense
5103640	5108920	considering how much fucking money the mario movie made like obviously you know people are thinking
5108920	5112600	about what other nintendo you know animated movies can they make which of course led to
5112600	5118200	the whole discussion about would zelda be an animated movie i wanted an acted movie i wanted
5118200	5124760	this i wanted that uh but basically uh they've they've come up to say like shut the fuck up and
5124760	5129240	this is cut this uh shut the fuck up is coming from super i'm paraphrasing but super mario
5129240	5135960	brothers movie producer chris meladandri uh said shut the fuck up no he said i don't know where
5135960	5141800	that came from about the zelda rumor i mean i can i can understand how people would surmise all
5141800	5146360	sorts of things because obviously we've had a great experience working together my relationship
5146360	5151080	with nintendo now includes being on their board of directors so i understand how people can surmise
5151080	5155560	these things but in terms of the specifics that was just something i've been hearing lots of
5155560	5161480	reports this is just about what's next between nintendo and illumination shut the fuck up
5166200	5170520	anyway you don't you don't want a zelda movie right now anyway because chris pratt would end
5170520	5178840	up voicing link and none of us want that so um i i feel like what comes next from the mario movie
5179480	5185960	which i still haven't seen you're not missing a lot i have it i know i need to i need to watch
5185960	5191720	it some i just i'm lazy it's one of those you know what maybe i'll just wait at this point and uh when
5191720	5196200	i come to visit bobby in july since by the way i will be at southern fried gaming expo at the
5196200	5202520	end of july in atlanta i'll i'll watch the mario movie at black wolf manor it'll be it'll be uh
5202520	5207640	it'll be a fun time so besides dark soccer you're taking me on a different movie date remember
5207640	5214840	all right why why can't there be more than one that's true why not both why not both all right
5215480	5221640	um we'll we'll see what develop i was gonna say with the mario movie uh donkey kong you know
5221640	5227080	things in that universe a sequel things in that universe seem a little more you know like what's
5227080	5235880	probably coming next and not just you know the legend of zelda but uh we'll see uh sj100 matt
5235880	5241400	says illumination verse where the movies all tie together for a smash brothers movie that's the
5241400	5245480	thing that's the thing that so many people on the internet what want do you know how long it would
5245480	5249720	take us to get to a fucking smash brothers movie do you know how long it would take us to get there
5250680	5257560	it passes i guess again an avengers movie yeah a while a while all right well you know what
5257560	5262120	let's this is a great opportunity for us to go to this next segment and talk about you know
5262120	5266520	some of these things that we might get to discover a little more of in the smash brothers universe
5266520	5267640	let's roll the bumper
5278200	5283640	and now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where i'll dive into the vault and pull
5283640	5290520	out a classic and tell you about it it's time for the classic game of the week all right dark soccer
5290520	5300360	what did you pick for us tonight i picked mario brothers not super not donkey kong
5301240	5307240	i picked mario brothers we are going to basics great pick one of my all-time favorites
5307240	5315080	so um it came out in 1983 so it's old
5318200	5324600	like us i mean well no we're not old we're vintage
5327960	5336440	yeah anyway um it came out in 1983 so 40 years ago um it was developed and published for
5336440	5348440	arcades by nintendo designed by miyamoto and the uh late yokoi gunpei um and it uh basically
5348440	5357800	just had two twin brothers they are twins originally mario and luigi who are exterminating
5357800	5363800	creatures that come from the sewers by knocking them upside down and kicking them away um the
5363800	5371400	first uh the version for the famicom slash nintendo entertainment system was the first
5371400	5376600	game produced by intelligent systems and it is definitely considered a part of the mario
5376600	5381240	franchise but originally began as a spin-off from the donkey kong series
5384520	5391400	at any rate um there is an updated version of it as a mini game in super mario
5391400	5397560	in super mario advanced series and other games and it's been re-released through various methods
5397560	5407480	before um so basically they jump you know knock these uh little creatures underneath or hit a
5407480	5415400	pow block in the center the origin of the pow block um they are a wraparound so you can run
5415400	5422680	off screen and come out the other side um and you knock the creatures upside down while avoiding
5422680	5430200	other creatures and uh and other obstacles like fireballs and whatnot and then you kick them off
5430200	5439960	the screen um but when you are out of lives you are your game's over um and you get extra points
5439960	5447800	by doing consecutive knockovers you know and you have all kinds of different enemies four
5448520	5458520	there are four of them there is the shell creeper which um is what evolved into the uh the koopa
5458520	5468440	trooper or as they are known in japan noko noko um but yeah that was the origin of them there's
5468440	5475400	the side stepper which requires two hits the fighter fly which moves by jumping and it can
5475400	5483400	only be flipped when it touches a platform and the slight slice piece however it's pronounced
5483960	5490680	that um turns the platforms into ice and it's slippery um it will disappear immediately instead
5490680	5495960	of flipping over and so it doesn't count towards your score um ice platforms will return to normal
5496040	5501320	at the start of each phase and then there's the fifth one the fireballs and
5502920	5509160	yeah you can't do shit to them um green ones are faster but disappear quicker the red ones
5509160	5515560	bounce around and don't disappear until they're hit from below so you can't really get points
5515560	5523000	out of them either um like i already mentioned the pal block um and it always fills itself at the
5523000	5533560	start of each bonus round so um it's the the game was actually suggested by yokoi uh to miyamoto
5533560	5541240	that mario should be able to fall from any height but miyamoto thought it's not much of a game
5541240	5545400	but they thought maybe he could have some superhuman abilities and they designed a
5545400	5552920	prototype that had mario jumping and bouncing around and then the uh enemies were introduced
5552920	5560360	again by yokoi um and you know had multiple floors set up and it really just uh evolved from there
5561000	5568440	and um because of mario's appearance in donkey kong they had overalls a hat and a mustache thick
5568440	5573080	mustache they decided to make him a plumber but he was almost a carpenter
5574120	5584200	so um and so they designed the game around the the plumber aspect um at any rate um there there's
5584200	5594440	a story about how mario became uh went from jumpman to to mario is that um a landlord named
5595080	5604040	mario's sick i'm not gonna pronounce right segale segale um had uh come in um and a nintendo of
5604040	5612120	america daft meeting to demand rent and they named jumpman after him that that's a story going around
5612120	5618760	i mean so at any rate this also introduced louis g who was created for the multiplayer mode as a
5618760	5627640	palette swap of mario so uh the two-player mode was also inspired a little bit by joust and um
5629320	5636920	by now mario brothers has been released for more than a dozen platforms um and they used the first
5636920	5644120	movement from Mozart's uh eine kleine Nachtmusik um at the start of the game and uh the song has
5644120	5653480	been used in other games like uh ddr mario mix and super smash brothers brawl um at any rate uh
5655160	5660840	there are some conflicting release dates even though the official date was in 83
5661640	5668520	um game machine magazine stated that it made its north american debut at the amoa show
5668520	5675560	march 25th through 27th and entered mass production in japan on june 21st um and then
5675560	5684600	there's these other different you know uh accounts of it but iwata in uh in an intended director in
5684600	5692920	2013 uh gave the presentation stating that the game was first released in japan on july 14th 1983
5693800	5700040	um it was labeled originally as the third game of the donkey kong series but uh
5702600	5706840	the uh over uh but you know we all know now that was actually more the beginning of the mario
5706840	5713960	series and there was a donkey kong 3 um but also um as far as the conversions nintendo held all
5713960	5722680	the rights in japan but the overseas licensing was given to atari um now the ports lots of them
5722680	5730920	many of them um there's the atari 2600 5200 atari 8-bit family atari 7800 answered cpc and zx
5730920	5736600	spectrum commodore 64 had two versions an atari soft port that did not get a commercial release
5736600	5744360	in the 1986 version by ocean software the atari 8-bit uh conversion was by sculptured software
5744360	5750200	and it's the only home port that has falling icicles there is an apple 2 version that was
5750200	5757000	never commercially released but it but copies exist um the nes one was released in north america
5757000	5764520	on july 23 1986 sorry that was the uh the family uh no that was the one never mind there was a
5764520	5771000	later nes port that was exclusive in europe in 93 called mario brothers classic series
5771560	5779640	um it was on virtual console it uh for we 3ds and we you um super mario brother uh sorry mario
5779640	5785800	brothers was also released in september 2017 for switch as part of the arcade archives series the
5785800	5793000	nest version was a launch title for nintendo switch online um it's been included in bonus stages for
5793000	5800920	super mario brothers 3 um in super mario advance mario elegy superstar saga there's a nest version
5800920	5810040	of it in animal crossing for gamecube aka animal crossing e plus um also uh you needed uh an e
5810040	5819080	reader to do the animal crossing e card version um there's also in 20 2004 there is a namco arcade
5819080	5824280	cabinet that contained donkey kong donkey kong jr mario brothers um although mario brothers was
5824280	5830840	altered for a vertical screen that was used by the other games um and it is cropped on the side
5831480	5837720	letterbox that way um it was a modest success when it originally came out 2000 cabinets sold in the
5837720	5844440	us by july 1983 and then it went on to be a lot more successful than that um game machine listed
5844440	5850440	mario brothers on their july uh 15th 93 issue as being the third most successful new table arcade
5850440	5859960	unit of the month uh nintendo uh sold 3800 mario brothers arcade cabinets in the us
5861160	5867080	and they are now considered mildly rare and hard to find um and even though it was released during
5867080	5875080	the video game crash of 83 the game did pretty well it wasn't affected by that um it's been
5875880	5885240	i'd say moderately well rated you know the 80 and higher um all across the board and and
5886040	5894760	it's had some legacy versions so the legacy versions are um you know kind of related versions
5894760	5902680	i should say is kite kita mario brothers that came out for famicom disc with uh added features and
5902680	5907880	uh revisions to the gameplay it had cutscenes and advertisements because it was sponsored
5907880	5914760	by a food company called uh nagatani um and it was only available as a disc writer promotion
5914760	5920600	84 hudson soft made two different games based on um mario brothers there's mario brothers special
5921320	5928040	that was a uh it had new phases and different gameplay and there was punch ball mario brothers
5928040	5933240	had a new gameplay mechanic as in punching small balls to stun enemies both of these were related
5933240	5942200	for the nec pc 8801 the fm7 and the sharp x1 mario clash came out on the virtual boy talk about
5942200	5950040	your fucking migraine games okay um i've got it um it was developed as a straight remake called
5950040	5956120	originally called mario brothers vb and it's the first stereoscopic 3d mario game instead of
5956120	5961640	bumping into your enemies from below you have to hit them with shell creeper shells um super mario
5961640	5966840	3d world for wii u has a version of mario brothers starring luigi called luigi brothers
5967480	5973800	um the high score for the arcade version as recorded by twin galaxies is by steve uh clay
5973800	5979080	soth um at five million four hundred twenty four thousand nine hundred and twenty points
5979960	5990840	and that's it so many versions yes my goodness um in fact it's funny you know i i was mentioning
5990840	5995160	about how this is this is really truly one of my favorite games of all time like or you know
5995160	5999080	especially when you go to classics like part of the one of the games that really got me into
5999080	6004360	gaming but um you talked about all of the various variety of ports that there were for the game
6004360	6010520	right and so you know you know which one of those i got hooked on you had the only released uh
6010520	6018360	commodore 64 version no it was the atari 2600 version gotcha well i mean i thought i just i'm
6018360	6025320	fucking around but you know i i i played a shit ton of this on the atari 2600 and i factually
6025320	6029480	found a video out there on youtube of what it looked like because man the graphics were really
6029480	6036040	parsed back from what you saw in the arcade but i remember the coin was literally like a data square
6036040	6041720	like it literally looked like nothing but like a garbled image um but you know what the gameplay
6041720	6047960	for the most part was definitely there um and i got hooked on this you know what i think i
6048440	6051640	don't know that i have the 5200 version so i'm gonna have to
6052680	6059960	go nab it oh i bet i bet the 5200 version looks so much better i found a cassette no i didn't
6059960	6066680	never mind i thought it was a cassette it's not but i mean there's one that's actually in a
6066680	6072680	sealed box going for 700 bucks but honestly everyone else is selling like the other standard
6072680	6078120	expensive one is like a uh a fifty dollar yeah there's a bunch of repros out there
6078120	6083240	so the 5200 version has some interesting kind of frame rate issues but otherwise it's a pretty
6083240	6088680	darn loyal port it looks like so that's kind of interesting the 7800 version actually would be
6088680	6095720	really nice to have too i have a 7800 yeah better play that you know than all the ninja golf uh and
6095720	6104120	then in chat dark tatsuya says i heard the pc 88 versions uh were uh neat i wish they'd released
6104120	6109880	those on fds or something well it turns out there actually is a gameplay clip out there on youtube
6109880	6116840	of the pc 8801 version that i'm bringing up this doesn't look anything like mario brothers what the
6116840	6120760	hell is this hold on hold on sorry uh and for those in the podcast feed like we're just seeing
6120760	6125400	a stage that just looks completely different and i was looking at one that had like conveyor belts
6125880	6129160	and things like that this doesn't look a thing like the other one but i guess that's part of
6129160	6133960	what makes it so cool is that it does uh lay out the configuration of stages in different ways
6133960	6138440	and things of that sort so i guess yeah as far as like a collectible item could go that is kind of
6138440	6143720	interesting i'll give it that um but very different from uh the other mario brothers
6146040	6146540	neat
6146540	6155980	so all right uh yyr in chat says i'm impressed by that 2600 version yeah i mean as far as like
6155980	6161820	2600 ports go the mario brothers one was pretty you know well done i remember popeye was also
6161820	6166060	pretty decent on 2600 like i i something about those nintendo ports again they didn't do them
6166060	6172700	here like dark soccer said i i feel like parker brothers made all those parts or something it's
6172700	6180780	been a long time but um uh the the atari ports are always very interesting so all right well
6180780	6184940	great great pick dark soccer i'm a little biased because that's one of my favorites too and again
6184940	6192540	i was like she never picked that ever yeah but yeah that's how it goes sometimes all right let's
6192540	6197100	check out some other headlines around the gaming industry real quick in a segment we call rapid
6197100	6204220	fire news we'll go to loki apparently people found out that you can go google katamari and
6205180	6209740	it'll actually bring up a little katamari ball that you can click on and then roll around the
6209740	6217900	page and pick up the images on the page so that's neat and it works on your phones too
6218540	6225260	yes you can click to um it'll roll towards where you click or tap so that's kind of kind of neat
6225260	6231500	how about a new katamari game someday no we're just gonna remake the old ones rehashes the old
6231500	6237660	ones over and over again all right sounds good and then uh there's a new leak coming out about
6237660	6243260	mortal kombat 1 apparently the reddit user who previously leaked the mortal kombat 11
6243260	6250380	details and dlc roster um they were sent a fake character list for moral kombat 1 by a user and
6250380	6255260	then they revealed uh that the characters were which characters were fake on that leakers list
6255820	6261580	also this has been corroborated by another proven leaker fate unknown so right now it says the
6261580	6269900	reboot will include 19 characters including ashra havoc johnny cage kenshi katana hung lau
6270460	6282140	lee may lu kang melina natara raden arico reptile scorpion shang tsung cindell smoke sub-zero and
6282140	6288540	tanya they're going into the console releases uh first the early console releases for some of those
6288540	6299100	characters it's interesting yeah all right cool uh dar sakura how about you um yeah i got something
6299100	6308540	um so i don't know why i haven't heard of this game before hell singer yeah but anyway um is a
6310060	6318540	rhythmic first-person shooter metal game and it's going to have dlc that uh oh yeah the essential
6318540	6325900	hits pack dlc will be launching um it actually should already be out on steam ps5 and xbox series
6326460	6336620	x slash s um but anyway um you go through eight musically infused hells with a blade and different
6336620	6345260	guns so the uh new dlc is going to have stuff by uh gorillas i have to now have this of course
6345740	6356140	uh depeche mode um and uh let me see uh iconopop but i love it that song is like old but everywhere
6356700	6364620	uprising by muse uh down with the sickness uh galantis runaway misery business by paramour
6364620	6373500	uh tsunami so yeah these are big songs yeah yeah well i mean it's feel good ink by gorillas i mean
6373580	6379900	older one but that was one that got a lot of people into gorillas that weren't before
6380940	6385660	uh dark to see it points out that this is on game pass saying i haven't tried this but might have to
6385660	6390060	make room on xbox while it's still on game pass me too this one's has not been on my radar but
6390060	6395660	it sounds like it ought to be and uh a dlc is a really good way to make money off a game that's
6395660	6405740	on game pass so um clever clever idea all right um moving on let's talk about diablo 4 and the
6405740	6413260	cow level or lack thereof that's right cow level is all over the news this week because uh it's
6413260	6418940	being denied uh that the exist that the level is actually there uh general manager rod ferguson the
6418940	6424780	general manager diablo in an interview with kind of funny said uh we really wanted to ground diablo
6424780	6430220	4 as much as possible we've had some fun but we want to make sure it felt authentic to the gothic
6430220	6434940	dark themes we had and because of that there's no secret level in diablo 4 that people might be
6434940	6440220	looking for as per previous games that hasn't stopped people from looking because apparently
6440220	6446300	there's minor evidence in the game some references to cows uh apparently there's like a bloody wooden
6446300	6452300	shard that has the letter w carved into it there's a musty tome that has things in it here's the
6452300	6457260	thing here's how i feel about the cow level i realized it was a thing in diablo 2 it didn't
6457260	6464060	show up in diablo 3 until one of the anniversary events so i don't think it's in i actually truly
6464060	6468700	don't think it's in diablo 4 right now but it will be eventually someday because the other
6468700	6473980	thing nobody's talking about is whimsy shire whimsy dale and that whole thing uh that is also
6473980	6478780	in diablo 3 but i don't remember if it was there at the start but they ended up adding it later
6478780	6484700	so i would say these will be things you're gonna see in expansions for diablo 4 because
6486300	6489820	that's gonna have a reason for you to come back exactly they're gonna keep you coming back for
6489820	6494700	something so yes it's all about the gothic dark fantasy now and all that and the storytelling is
6494700	6501260	really good and everything but they're gonna but look diablo 3 had a very similar path it was
6501260	6505420	serious in the beginning too and then got really fucking over the top towards the end diablo 4
6505420	6509900	will go the exact same way watch i mean they said it right now they said they want to keep
6509900	6522140	it grounded grounded like beef ground beef half-life 3 confirmed can you clip that matt
6522140	6530940	all right all right anyway apparently there is a whole discord server uh called not finding a cow
6530940	6536140	level for people trying to look for the stupid cow level that's probably not there but we'll be
6536140	6541020	there in a later patch for sure all right meanwhile let's check out some video games
6541020	6546460	coming to a store shelf near you much sooner than a diablo 4 cow level with some world release dates
6546460	6552220	loki what's coming out in the us uh we have aliens dark descent on pc playstation 4 playstation 5

6660300	6665260	expecting it to be kind of a big deal especially after that demo apparently that demo increased
6665260	6670140	pre-orders in japan which was something that they were looking to do so very very interesting all
6670140	6677900	right in the meantime the uk dark sakura so um on the 20th we have for playstation and xbox
6678860	6684860	we have aliens a dark descent um for the same we have crash team rumble deluxe edition
6685580	6692540	uh on the 22nd uh we have yugioh battles of legend oh this is actually the card game
6692540	6699900	um okay that doesn't count um on the 22nd first which in playstation we have valthirian

6722220	6730140	playstation alchemy alchemic cutie and i kind of want to play that too all right pretty busy week
6730700	6735500	uh around the world uh in game releases this week all right we have a few more stories for
6735500	6741500	you and then we'll be inviting your calls over at vog network.com discord our discord server
6741500	6748540	uh first up though let's go to loki yeah so apparently rockstar games has decided to remove
6748540	6755740	180 plus cars from grand theft auto online for some reason well that some reason is probably
6755740	6762220	greed is what it is but apparently yeah they've removed them from purchase in their in-game shops
6762780	6770700	and along with that though um they are offering some of them in some creative ways so for example
6770700	6777740	one of those ways is oh look at that it's that six dollar a month pay wall called gta plus that
6777740	6783500	when you have that you can exclusively buy some of these cars or they have them in literally
6783500	6788860	gambling as a part of the casino where they you know you've probably seen this in like real life
6788860	6794620	where they have actual like casinos that are wrapped you know auctioning off cars and stuff
6794620	6800060	like that well some of those are available through that as well so literal gambling in their game
6800060	6807260	thank goodness and um a lot of these nobody asked for yeah a lot of these are really like
6807340	6810780	old cars that are they just want more people to stream the game on kick
6813260	6818060	they're just classic cars that were like staples of like the series from all the way back to
6818700	6823500	like number one i mean it's it is kind of ridiculous the large amount of cars that are in here
6824060	6832380	um i don't know like they're also there's uh obviously there's a los santos car meet
6832380	6837980	which you can actually meet other players and buy them from them i guess it's like a
6837980	6844300	market that they can sell does rockstar take a cut of that too i mean like of course surprise
6844300	6851660	of course um so i don't know all the all the more reason like i hear stuff like this this
6851660	6857420	just really doesn't want make me want to you know uh play grand theft auto line which i haven't done
6857420	6867580	for a very long time it's gotten pretty bad um gta6 when i don't know hopefully well within the
6867580	6873420	next financial year so you know we'll probably hear about that at some point soon because they're
6873420	6880140	saying they're making billions of dollars next year um they said that they explained that they
6880140	6885180	removed lesser used vehicles although some of these are like big supercars and stuff that like
6885180	6890700	were some of the best cars in the game so i don't see how those are less used and what's the point
6890700	6896300	of that when they're not like removing the models of the cars from the game because if you own the
6896300	6901500	car already you get to keep it you still have it it's not like it just disappears it's just that
6901500	6908620	you can't buy them anymore so but why like that doesn't make any sense because it doesn't take up
6908620	6917500	any space reasons i mean paywalls is what i'm guessing i don't know but i don't know i don't get
6918540	6924140	all right well let's talk about a game that is coming out this fiscal year no really it is for
6924140	6933420	sure uh dar sakura i think you have a little update on starfield yeah i do um so it's actually
6933420	6942540	more about shirley curry also known as the skyrim grandma um she there was an easter egg of her in
6942540	6947660	the starfield direct showcase but she is flat out says she is not in the game nor is she going to
6947660	6955660	play it because oh no just the whole like i'm not gonna play it oh there's a reason she says she's
6955660	6962940	too angry because they're still waiting for elder scrolls six um get them grandma but i mean and
6963500	6966860	people are you know and she actually has a rebuttal for the people saying she's too close
6966860	6975580	minded about the games that she plays um but she says not so that she tries all kinds of games she
6975580	6983020	just doesn't like many of them um like she tried fallout and said it was way too depressing for her
6983820	6993500	um and uh she uh she's been so frustrated with waiting for elder scrolls um and she's kind of
6993500	6999180	uh run out of steam with skyrim right now um and starfield isn't really her thing because she
6999180	7008140	doesn't like space games so her her quote on here though is that uh um i have waited so long for
7008140	7014460	elder scrolls six as has everyone else i have played skyrim for so many years and made up my
7014460	7019660	own stories within the game that's getting harder to find new stories in my head on the same land of
7019660	7026540	skyrim um the starfield presentation was nice but still it's a space game and i am just an elder
7026540	7033340	scrolls five skyrim addict i guess lol this is from an email um so yeah are you saying the
7033340	7040460	skyrim grandma went on record uh when asked about elder scrolls six she said it's been 84 years
7042540	7052460	no okay uh dj rama s is suggesting that shirley curry should join forces with whoopi goldberg
7052460	7059340	and cause havoc on those gaming companies i'm all for a gaming grandma's union um it's quite
7059340	7063500	awesome did you uh dark sakura shirley you've heard about the whoopi goldberg is she have you
7063500	7069580	heard about this yes she's pissed about oh she uh loki she's pissed about diablo 4 because she's
7069580	7074460	actually a big diablo gaming fan uh and i knew that i knew she was super into diablo what i
7074460	7079020	didn't know is that she plays on a mac and they didn't put diablo 4 on a mac for whatever reason
7079020	7086060	which is which you know now that whoopi points it out i i you know blizzard usually does put their
7086140	7093340	stuff out on mac so it's weird but um i'd always given them is that they were really
7094540	7100940	early and strong mac supporters yeah so this this comes out of left field unless now
7103100	7110060	the reason i could think is perhaps maybe they just don't quite have the skill with uh programming
7110700	7123580	for both uh uh the uh doing intel and uh the m chip series yeah um or with uh with rosetta
7124300	7132060	compatibility so that might that might be a an issue and and it's an understandable one
7132060	7139820	but the m series has been out now for three years yeah they've had time and the development units
7139820	7148060	are always available for uh for well developers like way early yeah so um it is interesting
7148060	7151820	though that whoopi is going full karen on which is ironic because that's a real name
7151820	7156220	uh is going full carrot on this uh with the whole wanting a refund and all this because i guess i
7156220	7160380	guess she forgot to look and see if it would be she's kind of assumed it would be on mac um you
7160380	7166780	know i guess i yeah she didn't figure that out so now she wants a refund i'm sure she'll get it but
7166780	7171260	as some folks are pointing out did you're on my essence chat says well proton ish is coming to
7171260	7176060	mac and mac os and oma and i know that there's been chat about that they are they have made some
7176060	7182300	steps to make some of the gaming stuff potentially easier to port so maybe this isn't the end-all be
7182300	7188460	all on diablo 4 and a lot of other games to be quite frank so uh miss goldberg may get her way
7188460	7194220	uh eventually so we'll see but i'm sure she wants to slay demons in hell like the rest of us all
7194220	7205580	all right um moving on loki yeah so in the most non-news of news uh jeff keeley has confirmed it
7205580	7212140	yes summers game fest is coming back next year like duh like we knew that was going to happen
7212140	7219260	but apparently this year has set some records for him so cool look forward to it since i mean
7219260	7227820	e3 isn't really a thing so but we kind of figured it was coming anyways yep yeah um i mean it's nice
7227820	7232060	to have it confirmed as opposed to e3 that was up in the air until about six weeks before when
7232060	7238460	finally they were like oh i guess we're not doing it uh oops so all right well congrats to jeff
7238460	7243900	keeley i guess the in-person event was pretty good um you know our invite was lost in the mail but
7244460	7252540	apparently it was it was a good event good time was had all right uh let's talk about this is i
7252540	7258380	think big news we have heard that this was coming and there's been some beta releases of it but
7258380	7262780	i was playing dead by daylight this week at some point and i noticed i was like these notifications
7262780	7269180	are in a different font oh my gosh the steam client changed and it sure did that's right
7269180	7275100	the steam client overhauled notifications the ui elements the in-game overlay is now different
7275100	7281100	so that desktop client did get its update and that was released on june 14th so a few days ago
7281100	7287260	right around the time of that dbd patch ironically um and so many of those things like yeah it's it's
7287260	7293020	fine i like the typography actually i really like the typography better in it um it just looks a
7293020	7298860	little bit more modern a little bit more uh makes better use of the space that it has from a design
7298860	7307340	standpoint i do not really care for how it acts in the g-force experience um but i'm not mad about
7307340	7312940	it and maybe that's just something g-force needs to work on too on their end or something you know
7312940	7319740	since it is new for everybody so but it's been a delight here on my mac but one thing that uh
7319740	7326620	is is gone with this update the legacy steam big picture mode uh for those that remember that from
7326620	7332220	those old like you know steam machines used to use that and that uh the now the bug fixes has
7332220	7338380	the op command line option enable old big picture it has been removed um but you have a steam deck
7338380	7342460	interface if you uh you don't have a steam deck machine you want to use that but the uh old big
7342460	7351420	picture is gone some of us can airplay if you want to do that go for it it works all right that was
7351420	7356780	all of these slotted stories we had for tonight so we can open it up to you all if you have some
7356780	7366060	questions for us the stories were slots yes hot slotted stories are they loose slots hot slots in

7423020	7429980	full of your letters all right loki your your setup there sounds really um worrisome
7430540	7437420	so you know how like you know activision blizzard said hey hey you know that like pve mode yeah
7437420	7441020	that's coming with overwatch 2 and then they're like no it's not coming with overwatch 2 then
7441020	7445660	they're like oh hey yeah we're gonna work on it again well now they're the news is out that
7446780	7452140	it ain't actually part of overwatch 2 unless you pony up the money for it because it's going to
7452140	7457820	cost you fifteen dollars as part of the invasion bundle and that gives you permanent access to
7457820	7464060	overwatch 2 invasion story missions 1000 overwatch coins and a brand new sojourn
7464060	7469980	legendary skin or if you want to shove more money to the activision you can get the overwatch
7470620	7477100	2 ultimate invasion bundle for forty dollars it gives you a null sector premium battle pass with
7477100	7484940	20 battle pass skips an additional 1000 overwatch coins for a total of 2000 overwatch coins and two
7484940	7492940	additional legendary skins for cassidy and kuriko i was against by the way like it's a 38
7492940	7499820	value so that's some expensive 17 dollar skins i would rather go give that money to a slot machine
7501340	7506780	so yeah so hey yeah they'll bring your you know pve mode that was supposed to be included with
7506780	7511180	that game but it's going to cost you like you're buying another game anyways for that prize
7512060	7517340	i want to waste they've just they've really screwed the pooch on the messaging with that
7517340	7521580	game and i understand they had some creative director changes and things but i don't know
7522460	7527420	hasn't stopped some of my friends from playing it and streaming it a lot but um i i just i i have
7527420	7531340	not touched overwatch 2 since that first season that they kind of brought it back and i'm just
7531340	7538780	kind of like meh like if they do a free pve thing i'll go check it out but until then nah

7921420	7926140	they're not paying me to say it but like these doctor pepper strawberry drinks strawberry cream

7947100	7952380	it's like the lemon but i feel like there's like orange and lime in this too i thought it was coke
7952380	7957100	mixed with five alive that's honestly what i thought it was but when i read this on the
7957100	7961420	internet i was like oh no that's a distinct taste and that is exactly what this is
7961660	7964300	it's coke banana laffy taffy
7967900	7974220	that's yeah try it tell me what you think but if you don't like banana
7974220	7980460	laffy taffy i don't think you'll like it this is a very distinct chemical banana taste to it so
