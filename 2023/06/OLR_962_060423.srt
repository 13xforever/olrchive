1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,560
It's a weird time in history right now.

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,040
Writers Guild on strike, League of Legends pros on strike, Rail workers denied the right

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,480
to strike, French workers striking, Bobby Kotick claiming there has never been a systemic

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,020
harassment issue after paying 50 million to settle claims that they did and didn't have

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,040
procedures in place to deal with the fact that they did.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,520
I don't have a solution and won't resort to a pithy quip.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,380
Society is complicated.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,860
Some of these headlines are in tonight's news.

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,940
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you about

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,820
them and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where every

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
gamer has a voice.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,660
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,140
where every gamer has a voice.

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,460
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are live once again with episode number 962 of our

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,440
program for tonight, June the 4th of 2023.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,580
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here live each and every Sunday night when we record

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,940
with my co-hosts.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,580
Say hello first and foremost to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

19
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,580
No, I'm Pigmeg.

20
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,580
Yeah.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,620
So okay, but the people on podcast don't get that.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,180
So you're being represented by a picture tonight because it sounds like both you and I have

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,660
had a week.

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
You start.

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
Okay.

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,100
So I've made it no secret that I have myalgic encephalomyelitis, which is also known colloquially

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,940
as chronic fatigue syndrome.

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:40,220
And since starting ballet, I actually ran out of two of my medications and I started

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,580
taking them again very recently.

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,300
And partly as a result, I'm having dizzy spells after activity.

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:59,460
Not all the time, but I did a combination of like an hour and 15 minutes of yoga, Pilates,

32
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,500
bar exercise, weight training, and my cool down.

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:11,420
So because I mean, I basically do like mixed movement and then bar exercise to try to get

34
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
my turnout.

35
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,420
Today was the day I was working on my turnout.

36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:23,220
And I sat down for a little bit and just dizzy spell and I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not going

37
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,900
to be able to do makeup or stand up while my hands are shaking.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,740
So I just like, I don't want to be on cam.

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:39,140
So this little avatar I made in Daz 3D.

40
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,860
And I had just put together, you know, kind of a representation of my cosmetic that I

41
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,060
play with Meg in Dead by Daylight, but something a little bit different, but I always use the

42
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,460
pig mask.

43
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,820
So that's actually now my no cam image on my stream, because I use my camera to hide

44
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,820
my perks.

45
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,600
I was gonna say it's big V tube vibes, except the only thing that's missing is bouncing

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,540
up and down, like as you're talking and that whole thing, you know, sort of the mouth move.

47
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,460
Well, you wouldn't see the mouth moving under the mask, but maybe like bouncing up and down

48
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
or whatever.

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,740
The one I'm working on now is going to eventually, hopefully be a Vtuber.

50
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Yeah.

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,740
Awesome.

52
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,020
For me, my week, I have been dealing with strep throat actually.

53
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,020
So you're probably wondering what the hell are you doing talking tonight?

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,800
Actually I started in antibiotics a few days ago.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,580
My throat is now fine.

56
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,520
What the weird thing that happened is that from strep throat, it now went to what I believe

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,700
is a sinus infection.

58
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,580
I can't exactly go to see my doctor on the weekend, so I can't get that properly evaluated

59
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,580
in my own antibiotics.

60
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,540
Anyway, I'm not sure what else they can do, but that is very strange to have a strep

61
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,540
throat because that's not supposed to cause sinus issues, but it's likely that the infection

62
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,700
kind of traveled a little bit.

63
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,700
So that part's kind of weird.

64
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,900
It actually depends on the antibiotic that you're on is why it might not affect your

65
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
sinuses.

66
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,980
Oh, interesting.

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,700
I think I've taken this for a sinus infection for a Z-Pak.

68
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
So it's a pretty common.

69
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Yeah.

70
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,180
I myself, I always start off with doxycycline, but it's always worked for me.

71
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,340
Z-Pak is, well see, I'm allergic to penicillin.

72
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,060
So Z-Pak has always kind of been the first.

73
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,060
Oh, interesting.

74
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Yeah.

75
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,060
So it's that-

76
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,060
And amoxicillin.

77
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,060
Yeah.

78
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
Yeah.

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,060
Amoxicillin was the one I actually had a reaction to.

80
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,060
So they just say all penicillins.

81
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,900
So Z-Pak and the one you call doxycycline are usually the two go-tos, doxycycline, whatever,

82
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,220
are usually the two go-tos.

83
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,500
Yeah, same.

84
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:33,460
Actually do you remember when I took amoxicillin and I had that really weird raised skin reaction

85
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,540
that I kept going to the golf club with?

86
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,540
I don't.

87
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,540
It was a while ago.

88
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,540
When I had lucky pneumonia.

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,540
That was a while ago.

90
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,540
Wow.

91
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,540
That was a while ago.

92
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:48,060
I mean, I think it was like 2010, but it itched so badly.

93
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,420
But when I went under the blacklight because I'm so pale, it stretched out my skin and

94
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,420
looked like spiderwebs.

95
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,420
It was kind of cool.

96
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Oh, wow.

97
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,420
That's wild.

98
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,420
Yeah.

99
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,640
No, all my issues happened when I was 12.

100
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,780
I took amoxicillin for something and I got a big rash like everywhere and the doctor

101
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,420
said, all right, no more of that.

102
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,420
So interesting.

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
It gave me penicillin when I was five and ended up in the E.R.

104
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Oh, my.

105
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
Oh, no.

106
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
All right.

107
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Well, let's say hello to say hello to somebody who hopefully is happy and healthy.

108
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

109
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Yeah.

110
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
I'm all right.

111
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Yeah.

112
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Good.

113
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Good.

114
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,060
Except why on earth would you have that game playing behind you tonight on stream?

115
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,500
Is that that's one to switch I'm watching behind you tonight?

116
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,700
It is because it's just so that you realize that the game actually exists because I completely

117
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
forgot about it.

118
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,260
I mean, we're going to talk about.

119
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,220
Once again, Nintendo deciding to bring a sequel to something that, like, really no one cares

120
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,220
about.

121
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,020
Well, you know what, since you transitioned, why don't we get right into it?

122
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,740
I'll just give my usual spiel because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock

123
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,900
Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the Voice Geeks Network, twitch.tv slash Vogue Network

124
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,500
VOG Network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, who is back live tonight.

125
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,900
Bobby Black Wolf, by the way, at Summer Games Done Quick, which will be one of our fast

126
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,340
headlines later, but he really went into depth about being there and his participation and

127
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
so forth.

128
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,780
So if you have any type of interest in Games Done Quick and kind of what all happens at

129
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,380
the in-person event because it is back in person, he talked a lot about that on his

130
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
show tonight.

131
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,340
So I'll kind of give an extra shout out for Bobby tonight.

132
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,380
Stop trying to make one, two switch happen.

133
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,900
It's not going to happen.

134
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,940
Pretty much that's the that.

135
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,100
Let's get into the kickoff topic.

136
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
That is it.

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,660
They without any fanfare whatsoever, which is the appropriate amount of fanfare to give

138
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,500
one to switch is literally none.

139
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,620
It is out for preorder now on the eShop for twenty nine ninety nine.

140
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,220
It's releasing June 20th.

141
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,900
I could really just like I don't care at all about this game.

142
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:59,460
It was an awful game and now it's an awful game with a sequel and.

143
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,940
Like you already have like Wii Sports Resort or like not Wii Sports Resort, the Switch

144
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,280
Sports, which is basically Wii Sports, like you don't need this, like you tried this,

145
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,780
you tried to make this happen.

146
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,980
It didn't happen.

147
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,540
No one really wanted it.

148
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,500
And now you put out a sequel to it.

149
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Why?

150
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
I'm like, why would you do that?

151
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,140
I'm legit surprised this didn't go the HBO Max route, shall we say, of quietly disappearing

152
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,380
content into the night and writing it off and never releasing it.

153
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,740
I'm kind of surprised it didn't go that way.

154
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,500
Just, hey, guess what?

155
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,340
You know, now that you pay an extra money for that Nintendo Switch online, thank you.

156
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
Thank you.

157
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,340
And then or whatever it is, you expansion pass.

158
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Now you get this piece.

159
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,620
That's exactly what this should have been.

160
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,100
This should have been a free piece of crap for being a Nintendo Switch online member.

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,020
That's exactly what this should be.

162
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,000
It could be both because $29.99 is really not that expensive.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,020
But they could say, but you could get it for free with Nintendo Switch online.

164
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,740
But I don't think that they're doing that.

165
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,900
I really just don't see the selling very well at all.

166
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,620
Well, you know what, some folks in chat are talking about that.

167
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,840
Like Mike Deff says, didn't the physical copies for everybody's one, two Switch sell out?

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,360
Like it's awful and all, but it is selling.

169
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,440
There is I honestly think it's people that are looking for a fast and easy party game

170
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,940
that get allured to one to switch.

171
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,340
And I wonder if there will be a similar allure for this, except there's no physical edition

172
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
for this.

173
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,800
It's not going to be something that tempts them on the Walmart shelf.

174
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,400
Here's the other weird thing about this that I should point out based off of the screenshot

175
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,080
here are the artwork.

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,600
Half of the people have switch controllers or joy cons.

177
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,440
The other half of the people on here have cell phones.

178
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,720
So it sounds to me that it's a game that you can play with your cell phone as well.

179
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,280
They have that is confirmed in the description that your cell phone is, which is something

180
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,080
actually I thought was a brilliant move from Jackbox Games kind of brought that to the

181
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,320
forefront several years ago at this point.

182
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,440
And I think that was brilliant.

183
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,000
So I, I'm not surprised to see another company implementing that.

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm surprised to see Nintendo be that company.

185
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,640
That's the surprising part.

186
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
I'm not surprised at all.

187
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,860
Somebody took a good idea and put it in their own game.

188
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm surprised Nintendo did that because they're the ones to usually push their own hardware.

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,180
But maybe, you know, again, if they're trying to, to me, there's only one market for this.

190
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,000
There's one market for this.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,480
It is somebody who's throwing a party, has several people over, needs a party game everybody

192
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,940
can play and wants something new to play.

193
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,360
And this is it.

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,560
And you know, if you didn't have enough Joy-Cons that everybody could play, you would be probably

195
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,780
hesitant to buy it.

196
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,020
But since it works with cell phones, that's not going to be a problem.

197
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,260
Don't you all have phones?

198
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,400
We all know that meme at this point, but it's true.

199
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,180
Like everybody does have a phone at this point.

200
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,940
But you know, don't they have like the Jackbox Games on the Switch?

201
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,460
So like, I would just play that.

202
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,260
You know, Bobby brings up a really good point in chat as well.

203
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,620
There are lots of Switches that don't have Joy-Cons because if you have the, the one

204
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,740
that Alan has, the Switch Lite or whatever they called it, where it was all together,

205
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,120
you don't have Joy-Cons on that.

206
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,900
So you have to have something else.

207
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
Okay.

208
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Okay.

209
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,100
I bet you're not plugging into the TV.

210
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,420
So is everyone going to huddle around a little, a little Switch, let me go.

211
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,900
I can't really see the screen because it's so damn tiny.

212
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,940
But yeah, I think we're doing the thing, you know, like I, like I get it, you can play

213
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:44,500
through your phone and stuff like that, but like, it just, I, I, whatever.

214
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
You know what?

215
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Cool.

216
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,140
You wasted development time on this.

217
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,620
This is why I don't get like one, two Switch gets a sequel and gets development time.

218
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,900
Pikmin gets goddamn how many sequels, you know, for that thing, but like F-Zero, what's

219
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
that?

220
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Oh, I don't know.

221
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,820
We just don't make F-Zero games here anymore.

222
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,860
Well, the number again, it's not like everybody's one, or excuse me, it's not like the original

223
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,060
one, two Switch didn't sell.

224
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,580
Now I would argue that was because outside of Zelda, there was very little else to buy,

225
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,100
at least, you know, for that party environment and so forth.

226
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
And yes, I'm sure you all are going to come at me with the launch titles, but as far as

227
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,220
Nintendo's first party, and they are very good at getting the game out in front of people,

228
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,860
especially when the Switch was new and they made it, you know, they, here's what I asked.

229
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,540
So I see the quote in chat, the 3 million people bought one, two Switch.

230
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,140
How many of those 3 million people regret that purchase?

231
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,740
That's what I really want to know.

232
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,380
How many people are playing that game still, or how many people like purchased it because

233
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,540
they're like, well, there's no like Wii Sports type games, so I'm going to buy this.

234
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,500
Like look at the game that is behind me right now.

235
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,100
Like let me describe for the audio listeners.

236
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,900
It is a game where you have a chess that's wrapped in chains.

237
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,540
You have to twist your Joy-Con around to unwrap the chains.

238
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,020
That looks goddamn boring.

239
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,100
Like I would not want to play that.

240
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
It just, it's stupid.

241
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,420
And watching the people like dress up like pirates do it is just cringey as hell.

242
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,420
Let me ask this question, because if there is the cell phone integration, then none of

243
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,540
this stuff with the vibration can be in it.

244
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,020
So I'm going to be, I'm going to ask this question from, I guess devil's advocate or

245
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,040
whatever you want to call it.

246
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,100
Is it possible that them having to make the regular cell phones a controller as well will

247
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,500
actually make the games better because they can't just rely on the gimmicks?

248
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,940
No, I doubt it.

249
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,100
I honestly doubt it, because if they thought it was going to be a good game, they'd be

250
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,700
charging more than $29.99.

251
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,700
They have no confidence on it, so they didn't spend any marketing budget or very

252
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,780
little marketing budget.

253
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,740
It's not even announced in a direct.

254
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,180
It's not even something that they would throw in in their like random like directs that

255
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,540
they were doing, like with indie games.

256
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,980
They're like not even indie games, but like other things like, hey, this is coming out.

257
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,380
Guy, because they can't because they honestly can't say, hey, guys, I know you guys are

258
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,060
waiting for a sequel, the sequel you've all been asking for.

259
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,140
It's like F zero mother.

260
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,260
No, another retro game.

261
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,100
No, any of your excite bike?

262
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,740
No.

263
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,500
Oh, one, two.

264
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,340
Oh, oh, OK.

265
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,020
I yeah, I'm just of the mindset that like rather than release it for $30, I bet more

266
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,020
people would play it if they made it free with switch online, you know, and maybe, you

267
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,980
know, again, it's about making money and they probably figure they're going to get those

268
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,340
switch online dollars anyway, because people are going to pay the online, although Zelda

269
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
doesn't really have online.

270
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,180
Right. So they got it.

271
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,980
They got to know they're they're they're maintaining those online fees from somewhere.

272
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,620
I don't know, but OK.

273
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,980
Yeah. Yeah. Bobby saying the games are too expensive.

274
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,020
Here's a $30 game.

275
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,460
If you thought it was good, you'd make it more expensive.

276
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,660
Well, yeah, because I don't want to pay $30 for a crappy game.

277
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,380
I can pay $30 for a good indie game.

278
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,100
Sure. Yeah, I have a lot more enjoyment over it.

279
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,820
Like one to switch is just bottom of the barrel garbage.

280
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,660
This is this is something like if it was literally some other like random third party

281
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,700
company that made shovelware put this out, I wouldn't be surprised that that was from

282
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,860
them. The fact that Nintendo has their name on it doesn't make it a quality game.

283
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,340
It was just not good.

284
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,620
Yeah, well, we'll see when the reviews come out.

285
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,820
But again, I just I don't you know, I say that and I don't usually put stock in in

286
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,580
reviews, but I just feel like a lot of these the lower price tag, which Nintendo really

287
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,300
does, not even being in a direct straight to the store, like all of these signs point

288
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,820
out, this is the equivalent of a Nintendo write off like this.

289
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,260
This is it. They're they're firing this one late into the night and it is what it is.

290
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,260
And I fully expect the reviews are going to say this game is crap.

291
00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:00,300
And we might sound hateful or whatever, but I really think our prediction here is not

292
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,740
without merit.

293
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,460
I don't crap.

294
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,660
If it's not, then what a pleasant surprise that would be, then great.

295
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,700
I would be excited that, hey, it's only thirty dollars.

296
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:17,140
That's a great deal. But, you know, like Loki points out, even though, yeah, thirty

297
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,460
dollars is cheaper game.

298
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,020
And for the most part, we're happy to see that it's difficult to get excited when you're

299
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,660
looking at Jackbox Games, which the party packs are what are they?

300
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,060
Nineteen ninety nine for the party.

301
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,220
I don't I don't legit know what they cost right now, but there may be 19, maybe twenty

302
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,540
four ninety nine. And I would I would say I enjoyed any of those packs, any of them

303
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,900
better than I did one to switch.

304
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,260
Yeah. You want to get me excited about something that would be like a party game for

305
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,900
the switch and you can involve cell phones.

306
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,540
Make me another WarioWare game.

307
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,740
Could you do that with the cell phones?

308
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,820
And that would probably work for some of the touch screen stuff.

309
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,260
You could probably do little micro games and stuff and send it through there and have

310
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,740
some sort of interaction with that.

311
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,700
But like that's a better franchise than this.

312
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,860
This is just garbage.

313
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,380
This is I just don't see this being a thing.

314
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,220
Actually, you bring up an interesting idea.

315
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,580
Like what if Nintendo were to take the cell phone thing and put it in some other games?

316
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,020
Like I just I think I'm still sitting here shot going.

317
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,540
I just I never saw Nintendo doing this in the first place.

318
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,340
So for me to think like, oh, would they make a WarioWare game that you could control with

319
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,980
your phone? Like I'm like, no, they would never do that.

320
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,380
But I'm like, well, but I didn't think they'd do this either.

321
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:36,500
You know, could they do something that maybe they try to attract people with phones to get

322
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,580
more of those, you know, party in person type of games?

323
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,740
I don't know. I don't know.

324
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,460
But the other thing to point out is that we this this release is also surprising because

325
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,220
it's literally the only new game we know that's coming for Switch first party right now.

326
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,260
We don't know what else is on Nintendo's agenda.

327
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:02,420
So, again, this does feel very get it out there before they're going to reset the palette

328
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,860
and tell us the games we're really excited for.

329
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,020
When does this come out again, Loki?

330
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,540
The end of June?

331
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:12,300
It's on the 20th. And so, yeah, by the time like if they do, probably the next week is

332
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,380
when we get a Nintendo Direct.

333
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,220
So if we get a Nintendo Direct, you're literally going to forget that this game exists

334
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,020
again, like you're going to hear the other games.

335
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,020
You're like, oh, cool.

336
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,860
You know, I'm gonna look forward to that and then just immediately forget that this thing

337
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,060
exists like you did the original one to switch.

338
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,220
Yeah. But if the Nintendo Direct is before the 20th, and then we already know we're going

339
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,340
to see the footage for this game, which is still a possibility, Nintendo still may just in

340
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,540
the. They have to show they're trying to make money and, you know, that build an awareness

341
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,780
again, they will probably show some footage for the game and stress the cell phone thing

342
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,860
an instant party.

343
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,940
If you want to have an immediate party just by this game type of thing, I could see them

344
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,540
doing that if the direct is before the 20th.

345
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,780
But I still want to know what the hell Nintendo is doing for the holiday.

346
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,580
I do not believe there is nothing for the holiday.

347
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,740
I do not believe there is nothing for the holiday.

348
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:15,700
How? The only way the only way I would believe that is if Nintendo says it's because

349
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,180
we're targeting Switch successor for first quarter 2014, then I would believe that there's

350
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,060
nothing for the holiday.

351
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,900
But I just I know I know what everybody's saying, what the rumors said and what Nintendo

352
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,100
has even gone record saying.

353
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,500
I just I it blows my mind or there or they're going to really rest on a third party.

354
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,580
That could be two.

355
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,940
There could be some big third party announcements.

356
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,500
I just don't know what they'd be, but maybe something like Xenoblade Chronicles X, because

357
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,420
they still didn't have a remade that one.

358
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,020
They could, you know, do a remaster of that for the Switch could come out for holiday.

359
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,500
You know, there might be a few of those things that they could kind of pull on.

360
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,020
I guess Xenoblade would be more second party, but still, you know, there might there might

361
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,260
be some things they can kind of pull out to to to band aid the holiday until the Switch

362
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,180
successor happens.

363
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,380
So. Yeah, Deidre Omez says Mario Kart 9.

364
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,900
And yeah, I agree with Bobby.

365
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,860
They're not going to release Mario Kart 9 while they're still releasing waves of Mario

366
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,980
Kart 8 DLC.

367
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,540
I don't see how they release Mario Kart 9 for the Switch at this point, unless it's a

368
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,020
hybrid game with whatever the successor is.

369
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,540
You know, I hope the successor is fully backwards compatible.

370
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,940
We shouldn't count on it, but I think we all hope it is.

371
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,980
I think it would be a damn shame if something like Tears of the Kingdom wasn't playable on

372
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,900
the next console.

373
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,740
But we'll see. I don't know.

374
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,060
I would again, and I've said this before on the show, I'll make it quick, the low hanging

375
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,780
fruit, quote unquote, game to release, in my opinion, that kind of blows my mind that

376
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:55,300
they haven't done it this year is Mario Odyssey 2, especially with Mario movie having

377
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,740
been this year. And now the Blu-ray coming out in a couple of weeks.

378
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,860
Right. In fact, I actually know it's like next week because I think somebody in Discord

379
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,020
was saying the Best Buy like shifted to people's homes already, like broke street on it

380
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,620
or whatever. I'm still kind of blown away that there was no tie in Mario product for the

381
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:21,100
Mario movie. So again, I would think a Mario Odyssey 2 or something in the Mario

382
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,100
universe is the holiday title.

383
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,700
But what do I know?

384
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,300
Although I have had a lot of predictions come true this year, I'm just saying.

385
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,580
Nothing. All right.

386
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,180
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

387
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,500
this week, whether it's one to switch or something else.

388
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,580
Dark Sakura, how is your gaming week?

389
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
We have Black Knight Sword of Rage.

390
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,260
We have the pro version and I've been playing some of that and it pisses me off.

391
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,300
Been playing through Marvel's Midnight Suns on my second playthrough, doing a light

392
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,740
play through and I've got Storm and she's amazing.

393
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,940
But I think also her voice actress was Sindel, I think.

394
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
I'll have to double check.

395
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,500
But I'm just finding a lot of like the Netherrealm crossovers is kind of interesting.

396
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,260
But at any rate, I've been enjoying that.

397
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,620
I'm still doing, of course, Dead by Daylight.

398
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,540
Probably going to work on my Adept some more.

399
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,980
And did the.

400
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,340
What else is I playing?

401
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,780
Oh, yeah, Cult of the Lamb, which I love.

402
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,620
I played seven hours of Midnight Suns.

403
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,340
I didn't go to bed until like 4 a.m.

404
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,220
You were streaming late.

405
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:48,860
Yeah, well, Dan was staying up and he was going to let me know when the finale was up for.

406
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,780
Oh, yeah.

407
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:57,820
Game stone quick ended late for us and early for that because it was like five or six in the morning for them.

408
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,660
He passed out and finally I just could not keep my eyes open anymore.

409
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:16,980
I was just really fading and like I didn't get up until one today because I mean, it's why my submissions were so bare was because I barely could remember my name.

410
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,340
It was.

411
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:26,620
It was like the fatigue was like to the point I actually couldn't get out of my chair.

412
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:35,580
So if no one knows what the feeling of having your muscles ache to the point where you literally cannot move.

413
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,620
That's where I was.

414
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,620
And I actually.

415
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:53,020
Finally, after a little bit, managed to conserve enough that I could get up and go to bed, Michigan's Midnight Suns is a great game, and you can read all about it on the Internet.

416
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,540
I'm kidding.

417
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:09,860
It's it's a Marvel sort of strategy RPG-ish kind of game where you have like a card deck that dictates your moves to use in the battle sequences.

418
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:23,500
And you can do like story things and other things to like gain experience and gain items that will help you out and boost you up and all of this stuff.

419
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,420
And then you kind of not romance people, you kind of make friends with them.

420
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,460
It's just making friends, although some of them totally flirt with you.

421
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,380
Like, I seriously think that Morbius just is a flirt, like an unapologetic flirt.

422
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,220
It's great.

423
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,420
I was trying to get some B-roll of the game up for one of your streams, but for whatever reason, it was taking a sweet time.

424
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,500
But for those watching live on Twitch, there's some a Dark Soccer stream from last night.

425
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,700
So you see a little bit of what the game looks like.

426
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,300
So you can kind of see like it's the part where I burped into the mic, they don't hear the audio anyway.

427
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,980
It's just the video.

428
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:15,060
But you can see that you're like you kind of like you have a battlefield fight RPG thing like, I don't know, Chrono Trigger, but you're using cards to actually make the plays, which is interesting.

429
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,900
It's not just like fight, magic, run, right?

430
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,260
It's you're using cards to make your different plays, which is interesting.

431
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,380
It's a different way to do it, right?

432
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,620
And you have to be able to use your environment or combo your cards.

433
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:39,500
Like one thing that I like is that you eventually get the ability for your party members to be an obstacle that causes damage to the others instead of them getting hurt when you knock some money into them.

434
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,980
But like some of the major characters, you know, were corrupted, like in this clip, it's Scarlet Witch was corrupted.

435
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,380
And like Venom, Sabretooth, those are the big ones.

436
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,540
You fight Dracula, Mephisto, you know, some big Marvel names.

437
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:07,940
And I like that the continuity of it sort of it's mostly comic continuity, but it's its own universes continuity as well.

438
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,740
It's not like MCU style, though.

439
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,220
There are some some touches, you know, I think it's a great game.

440
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,620
I mean, I have zero regrets for having bought the legendary edition for a hundred bucks when they came out.

441
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,020
All right. And Storm, oh, my God.

442
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,860
So I love Deadpool and Morbius is OK and Venom is OK.

443
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,540
But Storm, oh, she's amazing.

444
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,540
All right, that's it for your gaming week, we'll go over to Loki.

445
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,300
Yep, more Minecraft just been plugging away, but an episode this week

446
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:55,580
built the giant metal giant met that's from Mega Man three, I think it's a mid boss that has giant

447
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,380
was thrusters, I guess, on the bottom of it.

448
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,500
So that was kind of fun. A big quarry.

449
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,460
Yeah, still working on more stuff for my season, trying to wrap things up.

450
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:18,460
And if folks want to check out your build video, of course, they can go to your YouTube over at Loki underscore O.L.R., right?

451
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,300
No underscore, just Loki O.L.R.

452
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,580
Oh, because I went to because I was just pulling the video and I did underscore Loki O.L.R.

453
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,900
and it worked, but whatever weird.

454
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,900
But yeah, you can check out the bill.

455
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,100
I was trying to see if I could show a little part in that video, because this is where you're kind of like in the weeds, maybe here.

456
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,820
Yeah, there there's the giant metal.

457
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,020
Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

458
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,140
Wow. Look at that. Sorry.

459
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:46,780
Sorry to those on the podcast feed, but just imagine I'm showing a very elaborate Minecraft build where Loki is kind of like in this pit.

460
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,300
There's like a tiny little door that he's going in that I imagine kind of helps him get back up to the top.

461
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,620
And you can see where the storage room is.

462
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,900
There's a farm farm in the giant metal.

463
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,500
It drops stuff out of the bottom of it.

464
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,060
Got it. Got it.

465
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,140
But but yeah, there's a really cool little Mega Man guy that floats up there at the top.

466
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,820
And yeah, this is this is great.

467
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,300
You do these such elaborate builds are so cool.

468
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,820
So I hope more people check them out.

469
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,540
God, just look how vast the Minecraft world is.

470
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,860
Sometimes you really.

471
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,820
Yeah, the size is just incredible.

472
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,820
Anyway. All right.

473
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,020
So that's it, just Minecraft for you.

474
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,780
Yep, just Minecraft.

475
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,980
All right. My gaming week again, I've been kind of sick, so it's cut into my time a little bit.

476
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,460
But, you know, I was all over Diablo 4, which, of course, had early access this week.

477
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:47,620
So speaking about paying one hundred dollars for the ultimate edition of the game, I paid the fee to get in and do the early access in Diablo, which I have been playing quite a bit.

478
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,420
Not as much as some people I know, because like yesterday I couldn't even sit down and focus.

479
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,580
I had so much sinus pressure, like right in that place that sucks to have sinus pressure.

480
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,940
So, like, I couldn't focus for long periods of time.

481
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,180
But everywhere is horrible.

482
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,020
But anyway, I did beat act two.

483
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,140
I did that earlier today.

484
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:15,060
So and act one was the basically the equivalent of the demo or the beta that was out before.

485
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,580
That was how much story was available.

486
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,700
So I've been able to play a little more and go through act two.

487
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,540
And I don't know if I have a lot else to say about this game that I didn't already say when I was talking about the beta, because obviously I've gotten to sample it a little bit.

488
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:33,140
But, you know, just to recap, I think this is more rooted in Diablo two than it is Diablo three.

489
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,860
I don't think being rooted in Diablo three is a bad thing.

490
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,500
I love Diablo three, but I realize a lot of people kind of missed some of the parts of two when they went to three.

491
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,940
And I think this is more rooted in two.

492
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,580
And I think there's a lot of people that are going to enjoy that.

493
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,820
But it has a lot of the quality of life stuff from three.

494
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:54,260
The open world stuff is very interesting because that's the only part that's like a little weird because it isn't randomized.

495
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,300
The overworld is always the same.

496
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,100
It is gigantic, though.

497
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:07,180
And there are all of these dungeons that you can go in, excuse me, and those are randomized and everything else that you do, like a classic Diablo game is randomized.

498
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,180
My understanding is once you get into end game, then you'll go in some of those areas.

499
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,900
And that's kind of like end game is running those randomized.

500
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:20,740
But with affixes, it sounds a lot like mythic dungeon runs in World of Warcraft.

501
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,180
I hope to be able to speak more on that in a week when I have assumably beaten the story.

502
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,460
I'll be streaming it on my own feed throughout the week this week.

503
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,420
They're going to be doing some Twitch drops this week, by the way.

504
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:38,220
So I would encourage you, if you have any interest in Diablo at all, watch the streams to get the draw.

505
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,060
I guess eat KFC, if you must, to get those drops as well.

506
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,300
But if you want to collect that stuff, if you don't, then whatever.

507
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,820
It's just I don't think they do anything besides really cosmetics.

508
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,780
That is the one thing, by the way, with Diablo 4.

509
00:29:49,780 --> 00:30:04,060
I have to agree with a lot of the stuff I've been reading that it is unfortunate that they kind of put all that cosmetic pay stuff in there because it's ridiculous when they've already paying $70 for the game.

510
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:17,980
But at least it is confined to its own little menu, its own little shop, and it isn't something where like you have to click through a pop up or anything like that, or it doesn't try to coax you the way a lot of free to play games will.

511
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,740
It doesn't do any of that.

512
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,820
So I will say at least it kind of puts it in its own little corner.

513
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:33,820
The one thing I don't like is that if you're like me and you can't stand to see notifications, so like you will know that you have a new quest unlocked.

514
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,500
There's a little notification thing in that tab, so you want to go clear it.

515
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,620
The shop tab always has new notifications in it.

516
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:46,020
So that little like part of me that like wants to clear all my notifications can't do it without going to the shop.

517
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,500
That's how they get you.

518
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,460
But otherwise, it's whatever.

519
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,220
I'll be interested to see what they do with the battle pass.

520
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,180
That's going to be very interesting when that, but I guess that's tied to seasonal content.

521
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,340
And, you know, Dead by Daylight has battle passes and it's all cosmetics and I don't mind it.

522
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,540
So I'll kind of be curious to see if it's a similar system in Diablo, which I believe it's supposed to be.

523
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,060
It's just, you know, how many of these season achievements you do basically tie into how much of the battle pass stuff you unlock.

524
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,700
And it is all cosmetics.

525
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,820
But yeah, I'm playing a druid and my druid is through act two.

526
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,820
My druid is level forty one.

527
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,060
No. Thirty nine, I think just before forty.

528
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
I think I went the wrong way.

529
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,580
It's a tractor level, not at a level.

530
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:39,300
My druid is level thirty nine and just got through act two because I'm one of those people that's like, I have to do every side quest.

531
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,900
I have to find every Lilith statue.

532
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,780
I have to do all these things.

533
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:53,540
But I finally got myself to stop doing that because the bonuses that you get in each zone stop at a certain point and you have to be in world tier three, which is a higher level to unlock the highest stuff.

534
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:01,020
So basically I said, OK, I will allow myself to go side quest adventure to get my two skill points that you get and then I'm stopping.

535
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,020
So that's that's what I just finished in the second zone.

536
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,500
I beat act two and then I got my second skill point from the zone.

537
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:15,980
So later tonight I will probably go and play act three and see how far I can get with that tonight.

538
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,420
Mishkins in chat says there's going to be a battle pass for D4.

539
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,540
Oh, Lord. Yep.

540
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,420
But again, it's supposedly all cosmetic.

541
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,900
That's what they promised.

542
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:34,020
So if that's what it stays as, then I don't think it's going to be too big an issue because the character creator is pretty good.

543
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,780
You'll probably you've probably seen a lot of people on social media sharing the characters that they've made.

544
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,540
You can make a lot of diverse, different types of characters.

545
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,940
In Diablo three, every character kind of had their default and you couldn't really customize that.

546
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:54,020
Now they don't have a default druid or a default barbarian.

547
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,820
It is always when you're on the character select screen, it is always randomized, the characters that are sitting there.

548
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:06,700
So you can see different looking people anytime you look at the menu of a class select, which I think is interesting.

549
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,260
I like that they kind of mix it up like that.

550
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:14,700
So Mish in chat says I made a second character because I'm like you, Rob, I do everything I can.

551
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:18,860
I'll make a second character, too, eventually, but I'll wait for the season content to do it.

552
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,460
When the season content drops, then I'll make a second character.

553
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:29,300
And, you know, because I assume that season characters will roll into regular like before.

554
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,180
Other than that, I've also been playing more Final Fantasy 14.

555
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:44,980
I should get my island sanctuary to rank 14 tonight because that's my end game content is island sanctuary or the, I guess, animal crossing for lack of it's more like farm simulator or something is more like what it is.

556
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,300
What are the what is the name of that big farming game?

557
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,620
Why is the name escape me?

558
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,860
Harvest Moon. It's more Harvest Moon than that.

559
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,460
But I'll get to that tonight.

560
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,340
And I've also been playing a little bit of Dead by Daylight, just a little.

561
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,700
But I did get Jane to prestige one.

562
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,900
I only have a handful of characters left to art at prestige one and Jane was one of them.

563
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,460
So I got my adept Jane as well.

564
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:21,740
So, yeah, I should also mention what Dead by Daylight they did a big pride stream earlier this week and they released a lot of charm content that are related to Pride Month.

565
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:30,500
So meaning like, you know, charms are things that your survivor can wear on their little belt or, you know, belt area or killers.

566
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,260
Yeah, killers can have them on their hook.

567
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:39,420
So most Lijabodqua people had the rainbow charms.

568
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:47,500
But now, like Dark Saga just said, you can have an ace charm if you want to have an ace charm or a pan flag if you want to have that or trans flags.

569
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,700
They released a lot of different identities within the spectrum this week.

570
00:34:52,700 --> 00:35:00,100
And that's really cool for those that, you know, want to use those and further identify or what have you.

571
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:06,780
And I think they also released another rainbow charm that was like an eye that looked pretty cool, too, like a more generalized pride charm that was neat.

572
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:13,300
So there is the one thing to bring up we had touched on before.

573
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,980
Yeah, please.

574
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:29,780
Yeah, so Pupers was, you know, a big figure in the community, one of the early fog whisperers, you know, the representatives of the game and just a really all around great person.

575
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:37,380
And he finally died on the second from ALS complications of ALS.

576
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:49,780
And so, on that note, you know, we just want to offer our empathy to family and friends, the people who knew him the best.

577
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:59,380
And also, you know, a show of support for the community, for everyone who he touched.

578
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,780
He is definitely a light in the fog.

579
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,980
Yeah, a lot of people in the Twitch community feeling lost this week, for sure.

580
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,060
And may his memory be a blessing.

581
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,860
All right.

582
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,260
I think that's everything to say on my gaming week.

583
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,900
So let's get into some news.

584
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,420
I'm going to turn it again.

585
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,100
The show is probably going to be a little shorter tonight, just because I'm feeling kind of bled or sacros feeling kind of bled.

586
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,580
But we do have some news we want to get through and talk about some of the headlines this week.

587
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,700
So, Loki, I'm going to let you start it off.

588
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,020
Right, Loki?

589
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,660
I'm sorry, what was that?

590
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,020
You started off, right?

591
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,620
Yeah.

592
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,860
Yep, meta quest three, I think I've been actually waiting for because I wanted to pick up a new VR headset.

593
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,620
And I know that they were going to be announcing a new meta quest three.

594
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,420
And now here we go.

595
00:36:50,980 --> 00:37:04,860
So the quest three is going to be coming out this fall, starting at $500, along with that they're gonna be dropping the price of the quest to down $100 again, so they raised it and now it's back down again.

596
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,780
So that's interesting.

597
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:20,100
Looks like it has more front facing cameras, a more powerful Snapdragon processor in as well, it's going to be capable of doing some AR stuff as well, which is kind of cool.

598
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:38,620
And then on top of that, they're going to be also doing a patch, or I guess not really a patch, a firmware update for the quest to, to actually bump up the power of it by like, I think 20-25% or up to 25% more.

599
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,780
So that's kind of nice for folks who have the the older one.

600
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:52,100
Let's see, yeah, so $500 for the 128 gigabyte storage version, and then 256, no price on that yet.

601
00:37:52,100 --> 00:38:08,220
But it is interesting to see, you know that it is, I mean, I'm curious to check out to see how much better it is, because I know my VR headset is pretty old, and I would like a new one that can sit in the box that I probably won't ever use.

602
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,140
But it's nice to know that I'll have one in case I do want to use it.

603
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,460
My kids are always saying, are you going to get us one?

604
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,180
I'm like, you already have a quest to that I bought you like six months ago, so shut up.

605
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:32,180
But yeah, the they've got, yeah, 40% smaller than the quest to it's got the same pancake lens optics from the quest pro.

606
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,300
So that's cool, even better visuals and a higher resolution display.

607
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:44,420
And they said much higher resolution quality pass through cameras now in color, assisted with a special depth sensor.

608
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,260
So that's going to be hopefully for AR, possibly.

609
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,580
Maybe we'll have to see some of the games and what they do.

610
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:05,980
Yes, we will have to see some of those games, including the one that they did promise us last time we talked about VR, and still nothing.

611
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:24,700
So back on October 28th, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, the lizard man himself, promised that they're going to be working on Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for VR, to which I said, wow, I don't really care about that because that's going to look like garbage in VR because it's so damn old.

612
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,220
But OK, sure, you know, if that's all I get, then I'm fine with that, I guess.

613
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:36,780
Um, nothing about the game at all.

614
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,700
So is it coming out?

615
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:46,460
Hopefully, Grow Street Games isn't working on it because that will be all sorts of awful.

616
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,020
I don't know, I like once again, like until I saw that article, I completely forgot about it.

617
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,420
Yeah, I forgot that that was the thing, too, until that story was making the rounds this week.

618
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:04,980
It's not really like a really cool thing to have an exclusive like, yeah, it's exclusive Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

619
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,220
I mean, you might as well just do like Grand Theft Auto one at that point.

620
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:16,220
I mean, it's so old, like, is that really all the quest three can handle is just like San Andreas?

621
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:23,900
Unless they're doing something real extra to it, which I don't I don't know why they'd have the license to do that, but I would hope not.

622
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,100
Like do like I'd be excited about Grand Theft Auto for VR, like I'd be down for that.

623
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,660
Like that's about as old as I would go with Grand Theft Auto for VR on like one of those headsets.

624
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,780
San Andreas is just too damn old at this point, but that's it's like a remake.

625
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:45,020
That's also you and you were like a top leaderboard player on Grand Theft Auto four.

626
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:52,980
So yes, I am hoping someday that Grand Theft Auto four comes back with online support so that I can once again dominate leaderboards again.

627
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,020
That will be my game.

628
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,460
But. But wait, we'll have to wait.

629
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:08,500
Random aside, real quick, speaking of VR games is not related to what you just talked about, Loki, and technically this isn't about VR, but a game that does play in VR.

630
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:22,780
Dark Soccer, I thought of you this week because I think I felt like our worlds collided a little bit because No Man's Sky, one of my favorite games that I talk about all the time, teased a lot of you know, they were when

631
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:32,700
Hello Games wants to tease a new or Sean Murray specifically, when he wants to tease a new game, he uses emojis and he was using a lot of Apple emojis this week.

632
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,860
And everybody was like, oh, is No Man's Sky coming out on Mac?

633
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,820
And sure enough, that was it.

634
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,940
No Man's Sky came out on Mac this week.

635
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:46,660
So this this game that's like seven years old, that continues to come out on these platforms.

636
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:53,260
But I did I was I and I thought it was legit cool that like it's coming out through Steam, basically.

637
00:41:53,260 --> 00:42:01,260
And if you already bought No Man's Sky on Steam, on PC or wherever else, you just get the Mac one free, quote unquote.

638
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,180
So it's already unlocked for you.

639
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
So I thought that was really cool.

640
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,100
So that's pretty good.

641
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,940
I mean, I already have it for Steam, so that'll be nice.

642
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,380
Oh, then, yeah, it's already in your library.

643
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,740
So that's really cool.

644
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,820
I just didn't want to have to keep logging into GeForce for it.

645
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,020
Yeah, this is fine.

646
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,060
Yeah, interesting.

647
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:29,580
You know, and if rumors about where Apple may be, because the No Man's Sky developer said we have something else to announce really soon.

648
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:37,060
If rumors about where Apple could be going very, very soon, true not to be true, that could be very interesting.

649
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,300
But we'll we'll wait until those curtains are pulled back.

650
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,740
I have not heard of any rumors, nor have I the desire to comment on them.

651
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,180
Yep. All right.

652
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,700
Yep. All right.

653
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,100
Well, let's move on and talk about something else.

654
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:56,260
Another game that I really like now, Diablo 4, because obviously I've been playing quite a bit of it.

655
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,820
But some people, unfortunately, have had a lot more trouble playing Diablo 4.

656
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:09,900
For the most part, the launch of Diablo 4 has actually been like shockingly smooth for a Diablo game or for a Blizzard game.

657
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:16,340
Excuse me. Like, you know, well, I got to say, actually, some of their more recent WoW expansions have actually launched pretty smoothly as well.

658
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:24,340
I think Blizzard just has that reputation from 10 years ago of having a lot of hot mess launches and certainly Diablo 3.

659
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:34,260
Y'all remember the big era when people were trying to play Diablo 3 and everybody was pissed that Diablo 3 was always online, which is funny because that's like the norm now and nobody cares anymore.

660
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,180
But Diablo 3 had all those issues.

661
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:45,100
Well, for the most part, for most people, Diablo 4 hasn't been an issue, but it has been on the PlayStation 5.

662
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:51,660
Some folks are having problems getting into Diablo 4 on the PlayStation 5, and this is because of what's called a valid license error.

663
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:58,180
So apparently what would happen is that if the game just couldn't authenticate or whatever, it would not let you in the game.

664
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,260
People found a workaround of doing one of two things.

665
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:11,180
The first workaround that was found was, oh, if you buy two dollars worth of the Diablo currency on the PlayStation store, you can get in.

666
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,460
And people were like, oh, that's shitty.

667
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:21,380
Oh, that's shady. But what the trick really is, is that you're downloading something new from the store and it's causing the store to refresh your account.

668
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:28,100
So people realized if you download a free game, you can also like go download Fortnite or whatever is free to play.

669
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,460
There's a ton of stuff in the free play section.

670
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,500
Go download something there and it will update your license and then you can get into Diablo 4.

671
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:40,380
Interestingly enough, this doesn't seem specific to PlayStation because it's also been happening on Xbox.

672
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:45,780
I know Dark Tetsuya was saying, yeah, I've been having a similar problem on the Xbox series.

673
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:52,500
So it doesn't seem like it's as prevalent on Microsoft, but it definitely hit PlayStation.

674
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,460
Really interesting thought.

675
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:09,700
You know, all this stuff lately about Microsoft trying to buy Activision and Blizzard and Sony's response was that, well, they could screw us on launches if they wanted to.

676
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:22,180
Now, I don't think Blizzard or Activision screwed the launch here because I think if it's a store license issue, that sounds like a Sony problem to me.

677
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,940
But if it's on multiple platforms, though, that is, yeah, that is so I'm not I'm not sure.

678
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:47,180
I feel like this is going to get diagnosed a little further, because if this is a Sony problem, then whatever Sony has to eat it, if this is a Blizzard problem, this issue is going to come back again in an arbitration room or a courtroom watch.

679
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,340
Because this is exactly what Sony was bitching about coming to life.

680
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,540
For better or for worse.

681
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:06,780
Yeah, I mean, I could see them someone doing a case, I really that it's not letting you play it for like a day or so, whatever.

682
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,260
I mean, they obviously got it fixed.

683
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,660
It's not like it's not saying, oh, we got to purchase it.

684
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,700
You know, you know, the pay to be in their minute one if they're not in their minute one.

685
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:24,940
And by the way, they that by the way, the part a lot of people aren't saying they actually opened the servers 10 minutes early.

686
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,140
It was supposed to launch at four o'clock Pacific.

687
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:36,420
Those sneaky little sneaks actually plugged it in at 350 just for this reason to not everybody slam at the same second.

688
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,820
They opened it early so people could get in.

689
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,340
It's a smart thing to do, but so they can have a little bit more graceful.

690
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,660
But again, on the PC front, you wouldn't know anything is wrong.

691
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,380
It's running smooth as butter on PC.

692
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,860
Like, yeah, I mean, sure.

693
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,380
Like people are going to sue about everything.

694
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:57,180
I still see like advertisements on Facebook about like steam lawsuits saying that steam is monopolizing PC and like.

695
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,780
Do you not understand how storefronts work?

696
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:02,700
But like.

697
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,460
Yeah, I don't know.

698
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:05,980
Yeah, sure.

699
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,140
I guess anything's possible.

700
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,140
People are dumb and will like sue over everything.

701
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,620
But like, I think is it is it warranted?

702
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,740
Probably not in this scenario.

703
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,140
I don't think they sue.

704
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,580
But keep in mind, the U.S.

705
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,220
hasn't made their decision yet on this whole thing.

706
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,260
So that's why I say it's coming up.

707
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,500
Not even like, yeah, that's not even anything like, well, see, you couldn't play it.

708
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,180
But yeah, it's like, but yeah, that's that's on Sony storefront.

709
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:35,580
Like it was your like if you had these license error issues, like, I don't know, it just sounds like a setup problem.

710
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,860
And it was on both platforms like.

711
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,900
That's just really like drawing straw there, like it's just like it's.

712
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,540
I mean, sure, if that's what like puts them over the edge saying, see, see.

713
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,380
No, I don't think it'll put it over the edge.

714
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,540
I don't think everybody like.

715
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,020
No, I don't think it puts anything of the edge, but I think it gets brought up.

716
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:55,500
That's all I'm saying.

717
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,460
I think this gets brought up.

718
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,980
I think Sony pulls this out and says, look what happened.

719
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,820
So it'll be interesting.

720
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,260
I don't know.

721
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:12,260
By the way, and on all that, I heard that, you know, you know, obviously people talk a lot and there's a lot of stuff circulating social media.

722
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:21,380
Apparently, somebody with Activision Blizzard is supposed to be meeting with somebody with the UK government to try to get them to reverse their decision on the appeal on blocking the merge.

723
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,180
But there is talk on the table that Activision Blizzard may pull out of the UK.

724
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:31,100
If the Microsoft thing goes through, they may just straight pull out of the UK.

725
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:42,220
That's an interesting thing for them to leverage, because it's not that the games would suffer because all they have to do is release the games as Microsoft in the UK.

726
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,620
They would close all the offices in the UK.

727
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:53,460
So I believe now that they could be playing this game is that they're basically saying, if you block us, we'll just pull all your employees out of the UK.

728
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,580
I think they're going to try to strong arm it that way.

729
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,380
That's a pretty.

730
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,580
It's shitty, but it's it's also business.

731
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,100
I get it.

732
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,260
Oh, God. What was that company?

733
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,860
It was.

734
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,900
Not Konami.

735
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:14,220
Remember, Konami had the the other like publishing arm that they use for the Nintendo because.

736
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,140
No, it's Ultra.

737
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:15,860
It's Ultra.

738
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,260
Ultra.

739
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:16,660
Yeah.

740
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,940
Ultra Games is coming back.

741
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,780
Babies publishing Diablo and Call of Duty.

742
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,540
I think I think if the US also blocks it, then they can't do that.

743
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:32,860
But if the UK kind of sticks out like a thumb where they're the only one that blocked it out of the others, absolutely.

744
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:41,100
Microsoft, they're going to put that on the table that basically like, OK, well, we're going to just dissolve Activision Blizzard's presence in the UK then.

745
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,420
And they'll I mean, it is shitty, but.

746
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,620
But it's a good tactic.

747
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,740
I mean, yeah, it's a good tactic.

748
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,060
Very good strong arm.

749
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:56,140
Yeah, but again, the UK has to stand alone in blocking it, which is a whole other issue.

750
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,980
If they're standing alone blocking it, then we kind of look at it going, well, why are they blocking it and everybody else?

751
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,020
Yeah, I mean, it's not the first time the UK's done something to block.

752
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:06,580
All right.

753
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,220
Anyhow, moving on.

754
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,580
No offense, the people are not their government, but I'm saying the government's been doing some shit.

755
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:25,420
Believe me, after after the years 2016 to 2021 here in the US, please, please understand the people are not the government.

756
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:26,660
Oh, indeed.

757
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,260
Indeed, we understand that more than anyone.

758
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,220
We we love all our friends in the UK.

759
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:36,740
Loudest and worst, you know, the sore thumb sticks out.

760
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,340
All right.

761
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,860
Anyhow, Dark Soccer, Konami got brought up.

762
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:44,220
So, hey, let's talk about this.

763
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,660
Silent Hill Ascension.

764
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,220
So basically it is going to launch this year.

765
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,620
There is a trailer.

766
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:10,500
It is coming out with Behavior, Bad Robot Games, DJ2 Entertainment and Genvid all together released the trailer for Silent Hill Ascension.

767
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:18,820
You know what I kind of hope with Behavior involved in it is that we get some updates for the Silent or we get another Silent Hill pack.

768
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,540
For Dead by Daylight, but going back to...

769
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,300
I would love that.

770
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,380
Yeah.

771
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:39,660
But anyway, with Silent Hill Ascension, you are going around Silent Hill and there are actions that are going to be going into the game.

772
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:45,460
Kind of, I guess it almost sounds almost like the quarry, you know, where your actions are going to build the outcome of the game.

773
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,340
But you are going to be playing with a global audience.

774
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,900
I guess it's built for streaming.

775
00:51:54,220 --> 00:52:00,100
But they are basically going to...

776
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,180
Hello, I am trying to see where exactly it is under.

777
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,380
They are talking about the environment a lot.

778
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:12,060
But they are going to build a completely immersive experience with, you know, live community driven moments.

779
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:19,460
I am reckoning that something like how Cult of the Lamb works, you know, or having a built in Dixper or something.

780
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,940
Interesting.

781
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:27,660
But I want to read this quote from Okamoto Motoy, who is the series producer at Konami.

782
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,820
Silent Hill fans and horror audiences everywhere will have a lot to look forward to.

783
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:42,300
We are pleased to tell a new interactive story and never before explored locations alongside new characters that will be introduced to fans of the Silent Hill universe.

784
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:50,060
It is you who decide the fate of multiple main characters, which will unfold simultaneously around the globe.

785
00:52:51,340 --> 00:53:01,700
Hmm, it almost sounds like the creative direction of the show could be whatever the Internet votes on, like it might not be like an individualized experience.

786
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:12,780
I don't know. I can't kind of tell, but I'm getting the sense that like it's actually whatever the entire Internet decides is what happens, which actually sounds really horrific and I hope is not the direction they go in.

787
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,380
That sounds very like how Elon Musk wants to run Twitter.

788
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,460
And I don't know how I feel about that.

789
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,620
But I'm hoping I'm misunderstanding that.

790
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:28,020
I think it's going to be like a choose your own adventure, you're going to have the presets.

791
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,340
OK, well, that would be much better.

792
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:38,700
But the thing is, is that this allows for a replay of seasons, if that makes sense.

793
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,500
I mean, it looks pretty interesting.

794
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,220
I would rather play, you know.

795
00:53:47,540 --> 00:54:00,420
Yeah, well, I'm OK with a narrative game, like especially like a tell tale kind of game or, you know, you even brought up Until Dawn or Cory, but I think that, oh, no, that's being done in the Dead by Daylight universe.

796
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:09,780
So I guess I get all these horror game franchises mixed up sometimes, but it could be interesting to see something go that direction for sure as well.

797
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:19,140
But yeah, I just I worry if it's something where the entire Internet votes on it because it's it's going to get gross real quick.

798
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,940
What? The Internet is a cesspool?

799
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,300
Yes, that part.

800
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,060
So, yeah, I just I hope they're not going that direction.

801
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:30,060
But we'll see when the game comes out or we have some more details.

802
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,540
S2100 Matt in chat says, yeah, I worry how that will play out.

803
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,180
Yeah, I'm going to try to be helpful.

804
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:46,860
Yeah, I want to try to be helpful, too, and I'll wait I'll wait to see some gameplay, some details to really kind of formulate those thoughts, but it does feel a little nebulous right now.

805
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,860
Oh, of course.

806
00:54:48,860 --> 00:55:04,580
But I'm still I'm I'm maintaining a little bit of hope that maybe it's enough that people will be fans of the series and want to that the good will outweigh the bad.

807
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,780
Yeah, and on the bright side, it's not the only Silent Hill thing that's coming out either.

808
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:15,300
So if this doesn't end up being your cup of tea, you still have the Silent Hill 2 remake, you still have the Silent Hill F or whatever that was called, they showed the trailer for.

809
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,260
So it's still all these other places they're building out the universe.

810
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,420
So if this doesn't end up being your cup of tea, there's probably something that will be.

811
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,020
Except Pachinko, for some reason, they're done with the Pachinko.

812
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,100
I don't know what that's all about.

813
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,420
Maybe no one's into the Apache slot that much anymore.

814
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,300
I guess.

815
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:33,660
All right.

816
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,580
Well, speaking of something else, people don't seem to be into anymore.

817
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,100
Loki, let's talk about a recently released game.

818
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:49,700
Yeah, I don't know if anybody was into it much when it came out, but there were a couple of people in chat here that were like, it's not as bad as everyone says is it sounds like could have been better.

819
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:55,500
It sounds like it's one of those things where it's like once you get back, is that like Harambee in the background on your stream?

820
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,620
What the hell was that?

821
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,980
This is one to switch.

822
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,580
This is what you deserve is a stupid monkey doing garbage.

823
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,420
I don't even know half these games.

824
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,780
I've played one to switch.

825
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,740
I didn't even know about half of these games.

826
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,220
It's in.

827
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:15,540
I remind you they have a game that I even when I saw it, I was like, what?

828
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:24,340
Like where they had you rock your controller to you had to rock the controller because the controller was a baby and you had to put it to sleep.

829
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,500
And my mind's like, someone's going to shake that damn controller.

830
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,540
So that would be wasn't there like a cookie mama spinoff game that was that.

831
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,060
And if you shook the controller, it was a big like, no, like that came up like X or something.

832
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,220
I swear that was the thing.

833
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,340
And that was one where they had it.

834
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,980
It was like a baby doll that you actually insert the controller into.

835
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:51,020
Like you put the Wii in its mouth or the Wiimote thing in the mouth or something terrible.

836
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,220
You do something horrible to that doll.

837
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,820
And yes.

838
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,340
Because that poor child did die.

839
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,340
All right.

840
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:05,460
Anyways, yeah, game's stupid or just, you know.

841
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:10,620
But anyway, it didn't have the bugs that Redful had.

842
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,660
So, you know, that is an unfortunate thing.

843
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,580
So what happened?

844
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,780
What happened with Redful?

845
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,420
Why was it the way it was?

846
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:25,420
Well, some reasons may have come out from this article by Bloomberg basically saying that, look, Microsoft didn't really have

847
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:29,660
hands on on the game development with this game.

848
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:36,500
They kind of left it to Bethesda to take care of, aside from making the decision not to publish it on the PlayStation 5.

849
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:46,260
With that, though, the Austin studio that was handling Redfall, apparently, you know, a good portion of the team, 70% of the

850
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:54,060
team that had made Prey, which was markedly a better game, had left Arkane Austin by the time Redfall had shipped.

851
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:59,220
So losing a lot of that talent could have definitely been part of the problem there as well.

852
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:07,700
Also, there was an interview with Kind of Funny Games where Spencer defended the creative direction of the game, saying one

853
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,580
thing I will fight is this sort of what went wrong.

854
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:15,060
There's clearly quality and execution things we can do.

855
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,700
But one thing I won't do is push against the creative aspirations of our team.

856
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,300
OK, I don't think it was like harping on the creativity of the game.

857
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,300
They were just saying the game runs like dog shit.

858
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,020
So, you know, maybe don't do that.

859
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,660
Yes, I understand the problem with the game is not like the story or creative stuff.

860
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,700
It's it's well, that's not I mean, yes and no.

861
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:48,580
Like, I will hark on the I will make a complaint about the creativity of the game, because, like, for example, you have

862
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:54,580
Dishonored, which has like really awesome, like real time cut scenes and stuff like that.

863
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,780
That's like a really, you know, a solid narrative to the game.

864
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:02,900
Same with even Deathloop and stuff like that.

865
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:09,620
This one has like static images that they pan slowly across the screen.

866
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:17,060
And that's it, like there's like no like cut scenes in there, it's like they like half-assed it.

867
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:26,580
Which I'm sorry, but like that, when you have one game that looks really cool, like you've put out games that are really high quality and then this one comes out.

868
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:30,820
It's just even that much more of a contrast to your previous games.

869
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:39,860
And so obviously it's people are going to complain about it because it's they were expecting Dishonored and you gave them one to switch.

870
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:51,900
All right, well, let's move on and address another rumor that's going around in the gaming community right now.

871
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:59,540
And that is that CD Projekt Red is apparently trying to get or is Sony is trying to buy CD Projekt Red.

872
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:13,100
And the rumor is so loud that President and CEO Adam Kinski actually said in a recent investor Q&A, not happening, CD Projekt is not for sale.

873
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:26,060
This dates back to apparently a Destiny leaker who had one that had been right before, had a thread on Reddit that PlayStation wants to buy CD Projekt Red in that investor Q&A.

874
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,620
The CEO said nothing has changed on our end.

875
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,220
I can repeat what we've been saying throughout the year, CD Projekt is not for sale.

876
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,780
We want to remain independent.

877
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:36,380
We have, I believe, an excellent strategy for sure.

878
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,300
It's not easy to execute, but it's very exciting to follow our path.

879
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,820
So it's pure rumor.

880
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:47,060
So we already know that they're working on some other things that have nothing to do with Cyberpunk 2077.

881
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,420
For example, a new Witcher trilogy is something that's being worked on.

882
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:55,860
There's also the expansion for Cyberpunk 2077, which will be shown at Cyber Game Fest.

883
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,140
That is something they're going to show.

884
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,180
So there's still more to come there.

885
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:12,420
But interesting that we always get these rumors about Sony trying to buy somebody like, like they've got to be looking around wondering who can we buy since Microsoft's getting Activision Blizzard?

886
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,180
Who can we buy?

887
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,220
I don't know.

888
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,300
Maybe they'll buy Capcom.

889
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:16,900
I don't know.

890
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:21,420
Just because, yeah, just because, you know, it still could be a true rumor.

891
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:30,060
It could be that, you know, internally, they're like, yeah, we're interested in acquiring this company, but if the company doesn't want to sell, they can't purchase it.

892
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:30,460
Right.

893
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,700
You know, that's still so both could be true at the same time.

894
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:34,700
True.

895
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,660
Hi, Dr. Sakurai.

896
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,020
Well, it's finally happened.

897
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:46,060
I can't make words.

898
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:53,380
It's Chiyo Kazuhiro, who is the current producer of the Mega Man series, has left Capcom.

899
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,820
He followed Inahune in 2010 as taking over.

900
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:09,620
The first one he worked on was Mega Man 7 for Super Nintendo and recently worked on Mega Man Legacy Collection and the Battle Network series.

901
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,900
But there is no announced replacement for him yet.

902
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:18,580
I wonder if this means they aren't working on a new Mega Man game right now.

903
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,460
You think they would be.

904
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:23,060
I thought the more recent entries actually sold pretty decently, but.

905
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,260
Yeah, I liked 11.

906
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,020
Yeah.

907
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:29,260
So that's unfortunate.

908
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,900
And they also they've been re-releasing like a bunch of those collections that probably sold pretty well.

909
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,460
So, yeah, Battle Network, all that just came out recently.

910
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:48,980
And and I would like to say that, like, I mean, I get it that they're not making stuff, but like watching the the showcase and like runs of Mega Man Maker games.

911
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:50,380
Pretty awesome.

912
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,140
During the summer games done quick.

913
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,820
Oh, I didn't see the Mega Man.

914
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,300
I saw some of the Mario Maker relay that they were doing.

915
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:03,340
But yeah, so like there's like a PC game that's Mega Man Maker that somebody's that they've developed and stuff.

916
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,420
And so you can make your own custom Mega Man games.

917
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:11,540
And they did a bunch of Mega Man levels themed after other, you know, eight big games, which I thought was funny.

918
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:12,980
Yeah, that's cool.

919
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,380
Yeah, all right.

920
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,660
Moving on, Loki.

921
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:23,460
All right, so there's this whole thing going on with esports now.

922
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:40,700
Basically, some of the leagues are trying to unionize and are striking over plans to make rule changes that would, I guess, cut the North American Challenger League from 16 teams to seven.

923
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,060
I thought at least I thought that they were trying to.

924
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:48,700
Yeah, the else the LCS Players Association representing the region's professional players.

925
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:53,660
So the estimated 70 players, coaches, et cetera, lose their jobs.

926
01:03:54,220 --> 01:04:02,020
And Riot says that the cuts were necessary to ensure that the North American leagues remain sustainable and economically viable.

927
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,660
So they're just going to try to refuse to play.

928
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:12,860
And then Riot's basically going to say, well, if you strike, then we're going to cancel the entire esports season.

929
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:16,740
I guess that makes sense if you don't play teams.

930
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,020
Yeah.

931
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:30,300
So they're saying, hopefully, this two week window will give us time to for productive dialogue between the LSCPA teams and the league and then resume LCS competition this summer.

932
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:40,340
The LCS will not be penalizing teams for not fielding their rosters during this two week period to allow for everyone's space to focus on constructive dialogue.

933
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:50,660
We're doing our best to ensure LCS employees, contractors, and others supporting LCS or others supporting the LCS are not negatively impacted by the delay.

934
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,100
So.

935
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,500
Yep.

936
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:03,620
And there was another thing, too, saying that there's Riot, they said that there's a possibility of teams using scab players.

937
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,340
Yeah, so hopefully, hopefully they don't do that.

938
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:08,220
Hmm.

939
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,060
I'm just like people.

940
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:18,140
Yeah, a lot of a lot of strong arm tactics going on in the industry right now in there.

941
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:19,540
Yeah.

942
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:20,980
All right.

943
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:25,420
Well, what a terrible what a terrible follow up this makes for it.

944
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:30,820
But it's one of those things where it's like the lion, the witch and the audacity of this bitch.

945
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:40,100
Like, again, here we are talking about, you know who, the CEO of Activision Blizzard, Bobby Beeptic.

946
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,540
Bobby Crap?

947
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,580
I don't know why, but he got a fucking cover story on variety this week.

948
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:51,620
And I'm assuming it's because of Diablo four's launch or whatever, which variety is a Hollywood thing.

949
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:54,220
But we know games are starting to bleed the line with Hollywood.

950
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,020
So fine, whatever.

951
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,580
I get why variety is doing that.

952
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,780
But to give this guy the cover, Christ.

953
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:11,700
But there's this whole interview that they just basically give him a platform to say things like, quote, we've had every possible form of investigation done and we did not have a systemic issue with harassment ever.

954
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:16,180
Well, fucking Jason laid it out in the intro already.

955
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:20,500
Like the lie detector test determined that was a lie.

956
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,140
Like, lie detectors don't work.

957
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:26,060
It's a Maury reference.

958
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:34,340
But it's just, yeah, obviously, you know, Diablo four is launching and all that stuff.

959
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:49,780
And oh, he's variety says in that interview, quote, continue to comment from, you know, who is saying, look, like any large company with 16000 employees, we're going to have some instances of workplace discrimination or harassment.

960
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:55,820
We're fortunate over our 30 years has been a very small number and it's something that we care deeply about.

961
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,940
I swear to God, that sounds like something our last president would have said.

962
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:09,580
That sounds like a quote from what the last like the the way that's phrased is just from the school of I'm not even going to say his name, but you all know who I'm talking about.

963
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,100
It's a very small number.

964
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:12,820
We care.

965
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,340
That is no, we don't care at all.

966
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,020
He needs to go.

967
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,180
He needs to go.

968
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:26,020
I mean, yeah, this is a perfect example of why he needs to go, because he doesn't think there's a problem.

969
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,700
I mean, he's come on.

970
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,860
I mean, there's no problem.

971
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:34,700
I mean, obviously, they're not going to come out and say, yeah, we knew about this systemic problem at our company.

972
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:35,940
Of course, he's going to deny it.

973
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:36,860
Of course he is.

974
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,620
Here's the thing.

975
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:40,660
He's only emboldened by everything that's happened.

976
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:44,260
Recap the board of directors at Activision.

977
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:53,020
So the own company that talks to this guy every day did that report that cleared Bobby Kotick of any wrongdoing.

978
01:07:54,260 --> 01:08:09,860
And in that report, it said, contrary to many of the allegations, the board and its external advisors have determined that there is no evidence to suggest that Activision Blizzard senior executives ever intentionally ignored or attempted to downplay the instances of gender harassment that occurred and were reported, which we all know again lie.

979
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:13,300
And Bobby Kotick said now he's just emboldened.

980
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:22,980
He says in the cover story of Variety, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you if any of what you read in the inflammatory narrative was truthful.

981
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,580
He shouldn't be sitting there.

982
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:35,860
That's why all of us that care about this industry are so fucking mad, because it's this systemic fuckery going on with the board of directors.

983
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:37,500
I got to watch getting loud tonight.

984
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,420
My voice can't handle it.

985
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,540
Breathe in, breathe out.

986
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:47,380
OK, it's this systemic fuckery happening with the board of directors that is allowing Bobby Kotick to stay in place.

987
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,860
And the whole process is infuriating.

988
01:08:53,140 --> 01:09:00,540
And the fact that now this is just a cover story that more people can read as almost like this guy is trying to save face is also.

989
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:08,700
Infuriating, and I just want to see this guy out of our industry sooner rather than later.

990
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:10,660
Period.

991
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:14,820
I agree.

992
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,700
And I don't know what else needs to be said.

993
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:25,380
So let's travel back to a simpler time when this guy wasn't in the headlines.

994
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:32,020
Let's go back in this next segment to a more fun time in gaming, if I can find the button.

995
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,900
I'm a little flustered by it.

996
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:49,740
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

997
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,860
It's time for the classic game of the week.

998
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:57,340
All right, what did you pick for the classic game of the week, DarkSakura?

999
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:04,140
Saturn Bomberman, which is a very specific reason I chose Saturn Bomberman.

1000
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,300
I love Bomberman, don't get me wrong, but this one is a little bit special.

1001
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:16,260
So of course, it was an action game developed by Hudson Soft for Sega Saturn.

1002
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:28,580
It is the 12th Bomberman game, and it was released in Japan on July 19th, 1996, and in North America on August 22nd, 1997, and in Europe in 1997 as well.

1003
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,900
It is a multiplayer game for up to 10 players.

1004
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:45,580
It is one of the top, I would say, rated Bomberman games, although it did get some criticism for not really pushing the series.

1005
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,500
But at any rate, it has that battle mode and a story mode.

1006
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:59,100
And then there's a master mode where you have to finish a series of levels where you're given rank based on how much time is taken.

1007
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:05,140
And so you have a scoreboard for how fast you do and you get different power ups.

1008
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,460
Of course, there's new ones.

1009
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:11,100
Saturn Bomberman brings in dinosaur helpers, which are found as eggs.

1010
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:21,820
And when you release, they're released when you destroy a soft block and there are babies, adolescents and adults in the appropriate strength level.

1011
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:29,180
They can take one hit and you can ride the dinosaur and basically they act as your Yoshi.

1012
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,900
They get hit, you're OK.

1013
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,380
You have different power ups.

1014
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:43,700
The special meter that slowly builds up and once the meter is full, your dinosaur will grow a level from baby to adolescent and adolescent to adult.

1015
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,020
But in battle mode, it's a little differently.

1016
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,500
When you collect an egg riding the dinosaur, the dinosaur will grow.

1017
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,620
And then you can jump off the dinosaur at any time.

1018
01:11:54,660 --> 01:12:06,340
So basically, the story mode for this is that you blow up poles with red orbs that are called Zarfs while destroying your enemies and blowing up blocks and getting power ups.

1019
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:13,140
And then once you clean up all the Zarfs, you get an exit and can go and you do a victory pose and there's a cut scene.

1020
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,780
The battle mode.

1021
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:20,380
So this is where it gets interesting.

1022
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:24,500
So you need two multitaps for this.

1023
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:36,940
Seven players can connect on one multitap or you can just play two, but you also can go against bots in the game.

1024
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:47,700
If you have more than eight players, you get a widescreen arena that shrinks the characters down.

1025
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:54,860
It's a little bit, it makes the play field area very large, but it disables some power ups, including the dinosaurs.

1026
01:12:55,820 --> 01:13:02,740
The North American version also supports the Sega Netlink for up to four players online.

1027
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:06,380
They were pretty split over this.

1028
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:19,460
Like I said, you know, a lot of people thought that this was an amazing addition, that the power ups in the system was just pretty, pretty awesome.

1029
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:26,820
You know, having the 10 players set up was also pretty great, but there were some people who thought it just didn't do enough.

1030
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:35,660
They think that it's still too much classic Bomberman and didn't add anything fresh to it.

1031
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:50,540
That's really been the only thing, but not everyone was fully sold on the 10 player feature as well because of the screen size and losing the power ups and whatnot.

1032
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:56,460
AGM said it was a mediocre one player game, but a fantastic multiplayer game.

1033
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:03,900
And honestly, I've only ever played this multiplayer, so I think the biggest party I played with was a six person party.

1034
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:18,780
They also said the graphics and music weren't super great, but this one itself, you know, like I said, this one, this one was just a really fun group game.

1035
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:21,780
I mean, in the end, that's what it was meant for.

1036
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:29,100
It was ranked as the second best Saturn game of 1997 with Fighters Megamix being right above it.

1037
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,580
I don't know if I've done Fighters Megamix, I might need to.

1038
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:36,980
In 2014, Retro Gamer placed this on their top 10 Saturn games list.

1039
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:46,620
And I think that, yeah, it's a little divisive, but I think it's a fun game if you just look at it for what it is.

1040
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:51,820
It's a Bomberman game and it's on the Saturn and you can have a lot of friends play with you.

1041
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,700
This is an ultimate party game.

1042
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,980
So there you go.

1043
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:01,940
All right, your classic game of the week, Saturn Bomberman.

1044
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,900
I was actually pretty surprised I've never done a Bomberman.

1045
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,300
Oh, you haven't done any, but I thought you've done at least one of them.

1046
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,620
Wow.

1047
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,460
I looked and no Bombers came up.

1048
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:14,700
Interesting.

1049
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:20,340
I think I've done, I think I've done Star Parodia and I think that's the closest to Bomberman I got.

1050
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:21,420
Interesting.

1051
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:22,620
All right.

1052
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:29,700
Well, I never played the Saturn one, but that party mode sounds really messy.

1053
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:30,460
It's pretty epic.

1054
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,260
It is messy though.

1055
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:38,580
I mean, like when you get to the 10 player one, I'll be honest, it never really appealed to me in that respect.

1056
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:46,700
But at the same time, I mean, it's, it's just, you know, it's Bomberman.

1057
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,460
How can you go wrong with Bomberman?

1058
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:49,540
All right.

1059
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:56,780
Well, let's travel around and get some rapid fire news and some other topics really quickly here before we wrap up.

1060
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,060
Yeah, we're going to move to wrap up here pretty soon, actually, folks.

1061
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:05,100
Sorry, I know it's a little early, but as I said, just for a multitude of issues, we want to keep it a little shorter than usual tonight.

1062
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,100
So sorry, but I'm sure you all understand.

1063
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,380
So let's do some other quick headlines.

1064
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:10,820
Loki.

1065
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:16,140
Yeah, so itch.io is doing yet another queer games bundle.

1066
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:30,780
I think we did something similar like this last year, but we have another bundle with 450 games, tabletop games, books, zines, albums, art, and from nearly 300 queer creators, all for 60 bucks.

1067
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:37,900
The price of one AAA game, you can get 450 pieces of games and all sorts of other things.

1068
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:39,660
So that's pretty cool.

1069
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:48,060
And I have no idea what's in that in that bundle, but it's probably a lot of stuff.

1070
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:53,620
I have way too much stuff on itch.io that I've not touched, but I'll still probably buy it.

1071
01:16:54,620 --> 01:17:02,100
And PlayStation Plus has announced their monthly games lineup for June 2023.

1072
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:07,620
So you're going to be getting with games of the plus NBA 2K23.

1073
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,140
And we have Jurassic World Evolution 2.

1074
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:14,340
Those are both are going to be on PlayStation five and PlayStation four.

1075
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:18,420
And last but not least, Trek de Yomi is going to be on both as well.

1076
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:21,020
All right.

1077
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:25,340
I think I gave you the same link twice for Xbox Game Pass.

1078
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,860
Sorry, we can come back and do those at the end if you want to find the right link in the showroom.

1079
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:36,700
Let me go to Dark Sakura first, then when I saw this headline, I instantly thought of you.

1080
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:42,300
Yeah, and it's going to be too much for me to do the preorder as much as I want it.

1081
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:53,940
But Cotton 100%, which is a SNES classic or a Super Famicom classic is being re-released for September 2023 date.

1082
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,380
It will be roughly 55 bucks.

1083
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:01,900
It comes with a brand new art reminiscent of the original.

1084
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,900
I'll be more specific about it.

1085
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:08,940
It says delivery date between September 26th and October 5th.

1086
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:16,060
So around late September, it's 7,678 yen.

1087
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:20,300
Now the delivery price on this of the release date of September 21st.

1088
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:20,820
There you go.

1089
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:27,180
Gosh, the delivery on this is 2,416 yen.

1090
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:30,060
But oh, my gosh, I want it so much.

1091
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,180
I love Cotton.

1092
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,740
But it's not the only game that they're doing this with.

1093
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:43,340
I think I'm just looking at some of the upcoming stuff available.

1094
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:50,060
No, actually, I think Cotton is the only one that's getting the release like that.

1095
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:58,660
I thought I saw other stuff, but yeah, there's Battletoads.

1096
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:04,700
Looks like Battletoads is a resale version of the scenes of it.

1097
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:10,740
And there's a Mega Drive game on here, too, which is.

1098
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,580
I don't recognize the game.

1099
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,940
Oh, a Glalancer.

1100
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:22,940
Yeah, so I'm seeing a few things on there for other things,

1101
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:27,780
but they also have a bunch of like retro knockoff systems meant to play things.

1102
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:33,820
But but yeah, I mean, Cotton, shit.

1103
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:35,620
I love that game.

1104
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:36,940
All right.

1105
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:43,180
Well, we had brought it up earlier in the show, but just to officially recap, Summer

1106
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:53,180
Game Stunt Quick did happen this last week and the official final total $2,239,204 for

1107
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:59,140
Doctors Without Borders, or I believe that's Merica San Fronteras is that's why it's

1108
01:19:59,140 --> 01:19:59,980
MSF USA.

1109
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,700
It's Doctors Without Borders.

1110
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,020
Yeah, but it's Doctors Without Borders.

1111
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,460
And yeah, they raised quite a bit of money there.

1112
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,580
That's certainly no small amount to blink at.

1113
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,420
That's a great job by All Done.

1114
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:22,220
Some folks are noting it's not as much as was raised last year, but there's probably a

1115
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:23,900
few things that come into play with that.

1116
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:28,060
Again, Bobby went into this in depth on his show, so I won't recap it too much.

1117
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:32,900
But something to kind of consider is that if you look at the timing that this year's

1118
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,980
event happened, it was really different from other years.

1119
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:41,340
Usually this happens pretty close to my birthday and OLR's birthday, which is the end

1120
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:41,820
of June.

1121
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:44,580
We're close to the end of June right now.

1122
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:47,340
So I would say timing is probably a part of that.

1123
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,900
But again, I will defer to Bobby's show tonight who gets a little more into it tonight.

1124
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,180
But again, I don't I don't think we should be like, oh, no, it didn't raise as much.

1125
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:58,940
I guess it still raised 2.2 million dollars.

1126
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,100
When was the last time you raised that kind of money?

1127
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:06,340
That's a great amount of money for a very worthy cause.

1128
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:09,460
So congratulations to everyone that was involved with that.

1129
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:13,980
All right, Loki, do you want to talk about Xbox Game Pass real quick?

1130
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:18,260
Yeah, so Game Pass is getting quite a few games for the month of June.

1131
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:24,180
So we have Chicory, A Colorful Tale that's both on console and PC, as well as cloud.

1132
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:28,100
Far World Pioneers on console and PC.

1133
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:32,780
We have Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 on all three.

1134
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:37,860
Slayer's X, Terminal Aftermath, Vengeance of the Slayer on all three.

1135
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:41,060
The Big Con, that's also all three.

1136
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,380
Amnesia, The Bunker.

1137
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:49,220
We've got Hypno Space Outlaw, Rune Factory 4 Special, Stacking.

1138
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:55,260
Let's see, Dord, I have no idea how to pronounce.

1139
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,420
I'm going to butcher this, but that's fine.

1140
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:00,660
It looks like Dordogne, I guess.

1141
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,220
That's coming out on all three as well.

1142
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,980
And then apparently there's going to be.

1143
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:10,220
Oh, gosh, there's still more.

1144
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:12,580
OK, well, we've got Super Mega Baseball 4.

1145
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:17,020
That's going to be early access with I guess that's EA Play.

1146
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:23,900
And then Supress, the Superlands, Six Inches Under Battlefield 2040.

1147
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,980
And this is like I think this is DLC game updates.

1148
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,580
So Tales and Trails.

1149
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:33,420
Yeah, of course, that's Minecraft stuff leaving games past.

1150
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,500
We've got our bridge constructor portal that's going to be leaving.

1151
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,020
Chorus, Maneater, Mortal Shell, Serious Sam 4 and Total War Three Kingdoms.

1152
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:46,340
There were some updates to that leaving list, by the way, since the time

1153
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:48,580
that that was published, because apparently it's out there now that

1154
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,140
on the 15th of the month, some pretty heavy hitters are going to be leaving.

1155
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,020
Among Us is leaving Game Pass, which was a pretty heavy hitter

1156
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:55,540
when that came out.

1157
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:59,420
And Shredder's Revenge, the Ninja Turtles game, is going to be leaving Game Pass.

1158
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:02,500
That would be that's been about a year since that came out, right?

1159
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,420
So maybe the year kind of ran out on that.

1160
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,180
So but that was still a little surprising.

1161
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,820
I was like, oh, Game Pass kind of been taking some hits,

1162
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:13,300
but I think something to really keep in mind.

1163
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:17,300
And again, as we start to get to the end of the show.

1164
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,580
This weekend, coming weekend, and by the time we're on our next show,

1165
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,060
going to be huge, especially for Microsoft.

1166
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,380
Don't forget, everyone.

1167
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:30,660
Microsoft doing a big event Sunday morningish, afternoonish.

1168
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,420
It's around isn't around like 11 a.m.

1169
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,060
I don't remember the exact time.

1170
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,620
Somebody in chat needs to jump in, please.

1171
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:39,900
But they're also doing the Starfield Direct as well.

1172
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,020
So they're kind of doing the deep dive on Starfield and Microsoft announcements.

1173
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,660
So we'll find out what else Microsoft's doing this holiday.

1174
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:48,820
And I don't think it's unrealistic to expect.

1175
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,420
There will be stealth Game Pass releases that they have not been.

1176
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:55,260
That is common with these Microsoft events is there's at least one game.

1177
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:57,500
They'll be like, and it's on Game Pass today.

1178
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,300
So even though it kind of feels like there's not much coming to Game Pass,

1179
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:07,260
I wonder if they haven't been stockpiling them a little bit to dump with this.

1180
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:11,540
Dark to see also reminding us Summer Game Fest is also Thursday.

1181
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,500
So there's going to be a lot that happens with that.

1182
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,060
There's no way I can simulcast that.

1183
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:19,820
Anything that happens during the day now, there's no way I can simulcast it.

1184
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,860
I guess I didn't mention it.

1185
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:25,460
I'll say I got a I got a promotion at work, which is great.

1186
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,260
And, you know, all that.

1187
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:32,180
But it just means more time that I just I have so much to do right now.

1188
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,740
So, yeah, I can't pull away for that.

1189
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,900
I wish these things were in the evening, but I understand because of time zones,

1190
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:41,060
they want to do a lot of these things because like one o'clock

1191
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:46,100
L.A. time is like nine o'clock in the UK.

1192
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:49,300
So I understand why they want to do things when they do.

1193
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:53,100
But yeah, it just sucks during the day I can't simulcast.

1194
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,020
But I'll definitely be checking out the footnotes after the fact,

1195
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,300
because I'm really curious to see what they do announce from the event for sure.

1196
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:01,100
So. All right.

1197
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,260
Yeah. Next week's show, we're going to have a lot more stories

1198
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:07,220
and hopefully I won't be feeling like shit. All right.

1199
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:12,100
Let's do some release dates of what's coming out this week.

1200
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,820
Loki in the US, what's coming out this week?

1201
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:17,940
This week, we have Amnesia, the bunker

1202
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:24,180
that's going to be coming out on PC, PlayStation four, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1203
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,540
Diablo four is finally coming out for everybody else that didn't preorder.

1204
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:33,300
That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1205
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,780
Loop eight, Summer of the Gods.

1206
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:41,580
That's on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four and Xbox one.

1207
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:45,580
Raiden three cross

1208
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:50,500
Mikado Maniacs, and that's on PC,

1209
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:55,700
Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

1210
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,500
We have finally a US one.

1211
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,820
It is interesting.

1212
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,700
The Mikado soundtracks are pretty cool.

1213
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,780
We have a Bleak Sword DX on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1214
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:12,420
Harmony, The Fall of Reverie on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1215
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,980
Pro Cycling Manager on 2023.

1216
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:20,580
That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

1217
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:26,620
And to go along with that, of course, Tour de France 2023 on PC,

1218
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:30,780
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

1219
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:32,500
And that is it.

1220
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,740
All right, let's go over to Japan.

1221
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:38,100
Japan actually a little slower on releases this week.

1222
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:42,780
The only release on the Nintendo Switch this week is the Telenet shooting collection.

1223
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:48,580
That's a collection of four games, classic titles from PC Engine and Genesis era.

1224
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:50,380
These seem like dark soccer games.

1225
01:26:50,380 --> 01:26:55,340
Granada, Avenger, Gyruss, and Psychic Storm are in this collection.

1226
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:59,020
Psychic Storm. OK, we have stories about Psychic Storm.

1227
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:03,340
I'm sure you have been around where Dan and I have gone, I get pissed off like that.

1228
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:08,780
That is a direct reference to them saying Psychic Storm in Psychic Storm

1229
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:10,380
because it sounds like I get pissed off.

1230
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,020
I see. OK.

1231
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:16,980
And it's like, Psychic Storm, but it's I get pissed off for us.

1232
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:19,500
Got it. Yeah. Anyway, one game.

1233
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,460
And then the only release for the PlayStation five in Japan this week.

1234
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:23,380
Actually, there are two.

1235
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:27,500
MotoGP23 is out this week in Japan on Japan.

1236
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,700
On June the 8th.

1237
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:34,140
But just like the rest of the world, Japan is also getting Diablo four on June the 6th.

1238
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:37,260
So if you were wondering, is that game coming out of Japan?

1239
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,900
Yes, it is. It is still coming out there.

1240
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,300
It's a worldwide release, really.

1241
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:46,860
So because not everything Blizzard does goes to Japan because infamously World Warcraft is not available in Japan for whatever reason.

1242
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:52,620
So not the people there aren't playing it, but it's not officially released in Japan.

1243
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:54,620
How about the UK, Dark Sakura?

1244
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:02,500
So in the UK, on the 6th for Xbox and PlayStation, we have Diablo four for Switch.

1245
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:07,140
We have Loop eight Summer of Gods on the 8th for the three.

1246
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:11,260
We have MotoGP23 on the 9th for Switch.

1247
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:14,460
We have Toy Soldiers for PlayStation and Switch.

1248
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,540
We have Garden Simulator for PlayStation and Xbox.

1249
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:23,460
We have Miasma Chronicles on PlayStation, Death or Treat.

1250
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:24,780
Love the name.

1251
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:29,220
Also for PlayStation, Seeker My Shadow.

1252
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:31,540
That's Eastall.

1253
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:32,660
All right.

1254
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:36,700
Well, with that, folks, we have reached the end of the show.

1255
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:42,380
I know it's it was a little shorter tonight, but I think I've laid out why it's still an hour and a half is actually pretty good.

1256
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:45,020
So thank you all for being here.

1257
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:45,940
I appreciate it.

1258
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:50,820
Let me quickly go to Loki and see if there's any last minute stories you want to cover tonight.

1259
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:59,780
Loki, hey, do you have any last minute stories?

1260
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,460
You all right over there?

1261
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:01,900
Yeah, I'm OK.

1262
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,820
I was looking for last minute stories.

1263
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,220
And no, we have no last minute stories.

1264
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,940
I was going to say, I didn't seem like a lot a lot happened this week.

1265
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:13,660
But again, you know, with E3 week would have been this upcoming week.

1266
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:17,700
I think a lot of it was probably being saved for this next week.

1267
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:22,660
So I fully expect next week's going to be a pretty big show with that.

1268
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:26,060
I guess there's one thing I guess I guess you mentioned this really minor.

1269
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:38,460
But apparently the developers that were going to be doing the Knights of the Old Republic to restoration DLC on Switch said that they're not going to be able to do that.

1270
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,860
Oh, I'm glad you brought this up.

1271
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,540
This is a big deal for that community.

1272
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:42,420
Yeah.

1273
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:50,140
So instead, Aspire is going to be offering some free replacement games instead.

1274
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:59,900
So if you are affected by this, if you preorder this, you can get whether they have Coder 2, the Sith Lords on Steam.

1275
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:09,340
They've got Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic on Switch, The Force Unleashed, Republic Commando, Episode One, Episode One Racer, Jedi Knight,

1276
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:14,580
Jedi Academy or Jedi Knight 2, Jedi Outcast on Switch as well.

1277
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,420
So, yeah, that that sucks.

1278
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,380
Which if you're a Star Wars fan, you probably already owned all those Switch games.

1279
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,100
So, right.

1280
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,980
I mean, it's not like this is a brand new game.

1281
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,740
It's just, you know, yeah, yeah.

1282
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:26,700
All right.

1283
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:30,500
Well, let's and I should shout out the mailbag.

1284
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,820
I don't think we had any new emails tonight anyway, but I will.

1285
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:33,620
We had garbage.

1286
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:38,780
Yeah, I will mention participate at orangesontrader.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1287
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:41,060
Again, that's participate at orangesontrader.com.

1288
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:43,420
I imagine we might get a couple after Summer Game Fest this week.

1289
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:43,900
We'll see.

1290
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:51,940
I have put out a call, by the way, for at least two cat pictures with nerdy stuff in them.

1291
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,020
No, no people.

1292
01:30:53,300 --> 01:31:00,660
I want like video game memorabilia or the old Miitomo thing, you know, stuff like that.

1293
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,740
Oh, yeah, because you're talking about updating the intro, huh?

1294
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:04,700
Right.

1295
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,540
And I need cheddar.

1296
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:07,180
I was gonna say I need to get you cheddar picks then.

1297
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:21,300
That actually is timed really well because our 21st anniversary, dot, dot, dot, is in three weeks on the 25th would be our 21st anniversary show.

1298
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:24,060
This show is now old enough to drink.

1299
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,260
So there's that.

1300
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:28,460
Don't we have other stuff we could be doing?

1301
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,780
Well, putting together cat pictures into a collage.

1302
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:31,860
Clearly, that's one of them.

1303
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,740
So okay, I mean, I was talking about like napping.

1304
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,580
Def says, what's the due date for that?

1305
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:39,940
If we want to make that happen by the June 25th show, then what's the due date for that?

1306
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:43,620
Two weeks.

1307
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:44,380
Two weeks.

1308
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:48,500
As today, SSJ 100 Matt would like to submit a dog.

1309
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:52,860
I guess put cat ears on it'll be fine.

1310
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,060
I think we can allow Matt's dog.

1311
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:56,540
He's cute.

1312
01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:57,540
Yeah.

1313
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:57,980
All right.

1314
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,060
Just this once.

1315
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,500
Dog exceptions on a case by case basis.

1316
01:32:02,460 --> 01:32:04,580
Ferrets are 1000% allowed.

1317
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:09,980
Actually, for Def, we should allow other animals too, if he wants.

1318
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:12,780
Yeah, we can have other animals.

1319
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:13,300
Absolutely.

1320
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,020
I'm gonna have to change this to O.L.R.

1321
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,180
Cats and friends.

1322
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:22,100
Yeah, cats and friends, because we all know cats are in charge.

1323
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:23,020
Absolutely.

1324
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,620
The cats rule the stoop.

1325
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:25,620
All right.

1326
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,900
With that, we're gonna wrap up the show for tonight.

1327
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,100
So that's it.

1328
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,500
Thank you, as always, for listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1329
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,660
If you enjoyed what you heard, tell a friend about the show.

1330
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:37,220
Help us spread the word, because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

1331
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,900
But we need more voices to put out on air.

1332
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:43,780
So a nice five star review on a site like iTunes or Spotify or wherever it is you heard the show.

1333
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,140
Those go an awful long way.

1334
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,340
So please consider that.

1335
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:49,660
In the meantime, we'll get everybody's final thoughts.

1336
01:32:49,660 --> 01:32:55,380
So Dark Sakura, I guess you get to get an early start tonight if you want on your post show shenanigans.

1337
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:59,900
Well, that means that, well, actually, I'm going to have a Shayla with me.

1338
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:04,940
I do not know about a Fixie, because I think Fixie is with their significant other.

1339
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:13,100
But yeah, I'm going to do some entertainment and ending things and stuff.

1340
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:14,540
All right.

1341
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,340
Well, do you have a final thought for us tonight?

1342
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:19,500
I don't have any thoughts.

1343
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:24,980
Oh, I guess I'll just go ahead and say, you know, again, we miss you, Peppers.

1344
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,940
I'm glad you're not hurting and may your memory be a blessing.

1345
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:29,220
All right.

1346
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,300
Well, thanks, Jamie.

1347
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:31,380
We'll talk to you next week.

1348
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:33,100
I guess.

1349
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:33,740
All right.

1350
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:35,540
Bye.

1351
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:36,180
All right.

1352
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:37,620
Loki, your final thought tonight?

1353
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:45,820
Just going to be working hard on more Minecraft content, just rushing to get stuff down or stuff done, I guess.

1354
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:48,180
Lots of work on, lots to do.

1355
01:33:48,860 --> 01:33:49,260
All right.

1356
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:54,260
And my final thought is I really hope I'm feeling better tomorrow because I do want to get to streaming some Diablo 4.

1357
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:58,460
I'm actually a little bit pained that I haven't been able to stream the early hours of the game.

1358
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,020
But it is what it is.

1359
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:03,260
Even doing this tonight, I'm already like, oh, it's pressure.

1360
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:07,380
So I'm going to go treat myself to a nap.

1361
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:10,020
So on that thought, we have a busy week ahead.

1362
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:12,900
I think we all need a nap because it's going to be a big week in gaming this week.

1363
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:18,700
So we will be here in seven days to digest all the news from Summer Game Fest, Microsoft's press event.

1364
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:23,340
I keep saying press event, but it's really, you know, gamer direct conference or whatever you want to call it.

1365
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:28,060
And whatever other surprises might be dropped on us this week, I assume there it may not end there.

1366
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,300
We may have some other surprises this week.

1367
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:32,020
So we'll talk about all of that next week on the show.

1368
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:34,180
In the meantime, I hope you all have a wonderful week.

1369
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:35,660
Thank you so much for being here.

1370
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:43,820
And I am now going to roll the credits, which, by the way, DJ Rama S subbed the credits out and made good on her promise from last week.

1371
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:49,180
So that being said, those on the podcast are going to hear something different behind as we outro tonight.

1372
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:49,820
Good night, everybody.

1373
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,580
