00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,040
to enjoy to tell you about this week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,240
every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,920
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:50,440
Welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,480
21 years and counting.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,400
Hello, hello, and hello to all those of you that are participating with our show live over

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,280
at Twitch.tv, Twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,360
Thank you so much. I see the love coming in as the show is starting and all the birthday

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,600
wishes. Thank you all so much.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
It does mean the world.

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,400
Let me quickly go around and introduce everybody.

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,000
Of course, I am Rob Roberts, and I've been here every week, just about.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,880
I mean, give or take some holiday weeks and vacation weeks because people are like, it

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,440
doesn't math up. If you do 50 weeks a year, shouldn't you be past episode 1000 by now?

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,520
Well, we do more like 45 episodes a year, which is still more than any Netflix show is

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,760
going to get, that's for sure.

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
But it doesn't math up.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,560
Yeah, I just said it doesn't math up.

25
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,080
So anyway.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
Hi, I'm Rob Roberts.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,160
And joining me to correct my grammar is Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,080
Well, I do it to everybody.

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,200
It's equal opportunity.

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,520
Fair, fair.

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,400
How are you tonight?

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,360
Um, it's been a week.

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Just a week?

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,840
Well, a friend of mine at work that I hadn't seen since before the pandemic died last year

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,960
while I was on leave and found out another of my favorite people at work is at home dying

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,160
right now from cancer.

37
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,600
So, yeah, it's been a little emotional.

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,400
Thank you.

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you.

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,520
Um, but which was, which was funny.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
I was watching like something about aging right before I went into work and found out.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,840
So guys, it's, it's been a week, a week.

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,760
Yeah.

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,120
You know, you know, I'm resilient.

46
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,120
Yeah.

47
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,840
Turning, you know, in turning 21, not to like totally bring down the mood at the start of

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,960
the show, but certainly when you've been doing a show, as long as this, when you're 21 years,

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,800
you know, we've had people, you know, you guys that show up here Sunday nights, you're

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,840
the extended family of orange lounge rate, or you are the family of orange launch radio.

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,200
Now you're basically extended family to us as hosts.

52
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,080
And, uh, you know, we've, we've lost some listeners over the years, like, you know, in,

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,320
in somewhat recent memory, a fat ninja DM used to be here, uh, on Sunday nights chatting

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,640
with us.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,200
And, you know, we lost him, um, probably about a year, a year and a half ago at this point.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,760
Uh, although it's very hard for me to time these days.

57
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,560
Um, you know, there's been, there's been other folks over the years as well.

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,120
So it's always, you know, one of those things where it's like, Oh, uh, those, those reminders

59
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,760
of, um, every day being a gift are, uh, certainly all around us.

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,960
So, um, we're, we're thankful that we've been able to be here for 21 years.

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
That's for sure.

62
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,320
Uh, we've had our health.

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,160
There's been ups and downs for sure.

64
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,280
Um, but we've had the ability to be here for 21 years.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,920
And so for that, we're thankful for sure.

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Um, um, let me also say hello to and welcome tech master.

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,600
Loki.

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,520
Hello.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Hi, how are you?

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,560
I'm good.

71
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,520
Yeah, I'm full.

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,120
What's that?

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,600
I ate a bunch of, I'm full because my wife bought, um, like a sashimi grade tuna.

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,200
Like, I was like 14.

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,720
I don't know.

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,520
It was like a thing that was like, it's pretty large and ate all of it with rice.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,440
I was going to go back healthy.

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,520
It sounds like you made a poke bowl, but like a Loki poke bowl, which all it needed was bacon.

79
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,600
I like poke bowls and like, and I almost got poke bowl today, but like I didn't because I have tuna at home.

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,640
So what we call poke here is not actually poke.

81
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,360
Well, you know what?

82
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,080
I mean, that I know it's missing all of the pocket monsters, but you know what, sushi's close enough, so it's fine.

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
Or tuna in this case.

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:39,040
I mean, just sounds like you, like, I mean, tuna is really, I mean, fish in general is really good for your joints.

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
So, yeah.

86
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:51,800
Um, so tonight we are taking a look back at 21 years of Orange Lounge Radio, believe it or not, uh, officially as of June 23rd, which was a couple of days ago.

87
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,320
Uh, that was our very first broadcast back in 2002.

88
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,400
Um, and for those that, you know, are new around here, cause we do get new faces, uh, every week, we're thankful for that.

89
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:11,360
Um, we started because all three of us met as we were playing, um, Dance Dance Revolution would probably be the most notable Bahmani game, which was a series of music-based.

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,240
Well, I shouldn't say was cause technically Bahmani games are still going.

91
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:24,280
There was a lull for a while, but, um, uh, Bahmani games are music-based games, uh, by Konami, uh, who has gone through their own series of changes over the years.

92
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,520
But regardless, we all met playing DDR at the arcade.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,640
And after we would meet up at Roseville Gothland on, what was it?

94
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:42,800
Tuesday nights, Thursday nights, one of them, we would go from there and we would go to the little cafe that was in the parking lot and we would, uh, just chow down on mozzarella sticks and soup, whatever else they had.

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:52,160
And, uh, just talk about life tangents and a lot of video games and what was happening, not just in the DDR community, but in the rest of the gaming world.

96
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,320
And so, um, on RIP, the mini loaves at, uh, the restaurant.

97
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,280
Oh man, those are the best.

98
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,720
They don't do mini loaves anymore, huh?

99
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,480
No.

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,200
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap.

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,760
But anyway, um, yeah, uh, you know, we would, we would, uh, uh, eat and, you know, talk and just be there.

102
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:21,920
So we kind of took that atmosphere and brought it to this virtual environment, you know, that we, you see now and, um, you know, especially since pandemic lockdowns happened, really taking that concept of a virtual table.

103
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,280
And, um, you know, uh, inviting all of you to be here with us.

104
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:36,600
So, uh, I really, really appreciate, uh, those of you that have turned out, whether it's the first episode or the, um, 965th episode that you're listening to of orange launch radio.

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Thank you so much for being here and just being a part of it.

106
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
Uh, really appreciate it.

107
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:50,200
And, um, I also wanted to say a big kudos, uh, that that intro tonight from Jason was very impressive with all the statistics.

108
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,920
Um, I'm assuming some of that had to come off the Wiki or really good memory.

109
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,560
Cause there was stuff in there where I was like, I don't even remember how many of those we've had.

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Uh, so that's, that's really, um, really impressive.

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:15,200
And also I just want to take a moment to acknowledge Jason as well, who has been instrumental for this program behind the scenes, um, over the years with our voiceovers, um, the hosting and, you know, keep, keeping the, the wheels turn in and all that stuff.

112
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,760
So just a big kudos to Jason for helping this be afloat for 21 years.

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,600
I know you haven't heard him regularly on this show in a while.

114
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,600
He used to come in the studio for a while when it made more, when it clicked more for his personal life to be able to do that.

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,640
But, um, just, you know, want to give that big, thank you as well.

116
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:43,600
I also want to give, um, I'm sure there's a lot of people we could thank and I'm going to forget people, but I also want to give a shout out to Bobby black Wolf because we do tape live every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific, right after the Bobby black will show.

117
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,440
And Bobby for years and years has joked that he's the opening act to orange launch radio.

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:59,960
I think he knows we don't really see it that way, but, um, we are happy to share the stage with Bobby every week, pretty much for what, like 18 of those 21 years.

119
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,280
Um, so, and maybe not quite that long, but almost, it really feels like that it's been a long, long time, uh, sharing the stage with Bobby.

120
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,040
So we appreciate that.

121
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:17,960
Bobby is also, you know, there was a time when this show almost ended after four years when life 365, uh, kind of.

122
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:31,000
Fucked her, I guess life is five is back, but this is the old life is five when you could like run your own network on there and you know, some internet rate things went through and the rates are going to go through the roof and we weren't really going to be able to afford to keep our own station running anymore.

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,640
Cause orange radio was not just a show.

124
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:47,320
It was a station, uh, back in the beginning and, uh, we didn't think we were going to be able to run it anymore, but Bobby was really the one that kind of connected us with, um, all games radio who at the time then became our home network for quite some time.

125
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,920
Um, before then, of course the voice of geeks network about, uh, God, 11 years ago at this point.

126
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,680
So, um, thank you to Bobby.

127
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Who's made, made sure we've always had a stage to do this on.

128
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,720
That's for sure.

129
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,080
So, uh, yeah, and dark to see you talking about life.

130
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,800
365 says they came back, huh?

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,080
Yeah.

132
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,640
I remember doing, cause I was like, do they charge you to broadcast on there now?

133
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,040
Yeah.

134
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I think somebody, uh, somebody new bought it.

135
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,760
Like it's changed hands as a lot of websites do.

136
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,160
And I think, I think it tries to be a broadcast in a box type of thing, but it's, you know, here we are on Twitch.

137
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,400
Twitch is the mechanism that we can record the podcast, which this has always been an audio show from the very beginning.

138
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,040
So yes, video is here.

139
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,720
We're happy to see you on Twitch and all that stuff, but it's, it's really an audio show.

140
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,600
This was inspired not by other podcasts because I mean, I'm not trying to sound egotistical.

141
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:50,000
It's just the fact when there was nobody else out there that when we, when we started doing this type of thing, there were other broadcasters.

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,720
There was nothing like what you see today.

143
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
That was the medium.

144
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:02,440
We were influenced by more traditional radio shows and like the three hour programs you might see on Sirius XM or on broadcast radio.

145
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,360
That's where the roots of our show is.

146
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,760
Not like a 30 minute, one hour package, um, you know, that you might see in more traditional, you know, types of formats.

147
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,360
And that's why the show has continued to run essentially as long as we feel it needs to.

148
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,400
I don't know if there's a lot of shows out there that run beyond an hour on a regular basis.

149
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:29,160
There's some, I'm sure there are, but, um, you know, just, we've been doing it our way and that's how we've made it for 21 years.

150
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,200
So, uh, I'm rambling.

151
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
I tend to do that, but I want to take a minute to acknowledge.

152
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:44,640
Does anybody else, uh, want to, um, oh, one other shout out I should give, actually, I know I'm going to forget people and I'm sorry about that because I didn't plan this out in advance, but I want to make sure I also shout out Travis Donovan.

153
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,960
I know he's not here and he's doing his old thing.

154
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:58,320
He's being a crabby old man yelling at a cloud, but, and we love him for it, but you know, he was the one that showed me and dark soccer to an extent that literally any idiot can podcast.

155
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:08,560
And I mean that in the nicest possible way, but you know, I went to college thinking I would want to get into radio and I might want to be actually, then it was TV, a weatherman to do all this stuff.

156
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,120
And then when I actually interned in the industry, uh, I learned that I don't want to, I don't want to do this.

157
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,600
I don't have the fight to, um, I was, I'm just going to be very blunt.

158
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
I don't want to blow my way to the top.

159
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:41,320
Uh, and this industry is very competitive and this, this whole thing, I don't, I don't, I don't think it's for me, but Travis showed me very early on that with a gorilla radio type of setup in your spare bedroom and an internet connection, you can create radio on your own terms.

160
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,800
And that's the path that, you know, we've been forging here at orange launch radio.

161
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,520
And many of you out there that are content creators have been forging ever since.

162
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,480
And it's a, it's a, it's a wonderful, wonderful thing.

163
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,080
So I learned that watching pump up the volume later, that movie was obviously a huge influence as well, but that was a movie.

164
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,400
Right.

165
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,120
And to see it in real life was like, Oh, I don't have to break the law to do this type of thing.

166
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,480
I'd like to, I'd like to thank Christian Slater.

167
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,600
And, uh, what was her name that played the eat me, beat me lady?

168
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,920
Oh, I don't, I don't.

169
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
Somebody in chattel side.

170
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,640
I remember who you're talking about, but yeah, I don't remember the actress's name.

171
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,800
Um, it's almost there, but now I'm just, I'm, I'm kidding.

172
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,520
I think Bobby.

173
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,360
Um, so as to show 100, Matt and chat says, if Travis were here, he'd say, I made you, but I'm too old and going to take a nap.

174
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,840
That sounds, that sounds about right.

175
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,440
That's the very time I think of Travis.

176
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,240
I think of him with a bra on his head saying he's queen on the dollar.

177
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,000
It's not just him saying he's queen on the dollar.

178
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,360
He would put the bra on his head and go, I'm queen on the dollar.

179
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah.

180
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,520
This whole thing he would do.

181
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:54,760
I got to wonder though, is he going to, you know, with the new starfield coming out and stuff, he's going to switch up his cosplay to do some of that instead of all the mass effects stuff.

182
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,320
Or you think he's going to stick with that going forward?

183
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,520
Uh, I don't know.

184
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,760
Cause he doesn't, he doesn't really go to dragon con anymore.

185
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,560
He made a surprise appearance a couple of years ago, but, um, he hasn't been since, Oh, S.

186
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,200
Jonah to Matt says, Samantha Mathis is who you're looking for.

187
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,560
Jamie.

188
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,600
Didn't she play the original princess peach or Daisy, whoever it was in the original Mario movie.

189
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Wasn't that also her in the nineties, Mario movie?

190
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,760
I'm almost positive.

191
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,600
It was, that would be assuming I actually watched that.

192
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
Yeah, no, it was interesting connection.

193
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,000
So pump up the volume does connect to video games in many ways.

194
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,080
Um, Rama confirms.

195
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,560
Yes.

196
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,280
And I also want to ignore, uh, acknowledge this.

197
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,120
Um, uh, some of you in chat are saying some very nice things.

198
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,960
Pod culture says, uh, Rob, y'all were the biggest influence on our show.

199
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,240
Um, and, uh, fixie high fixation, gays fixie and chat says ramble away.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,840
This is you guys big day.

201
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,600
Yes.

202
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,040
Um, as Joe and Hunter, Matt pointing out, there were always some webcams, the 56 K cam of the guest couch.

203
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,400
Yes.

204
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,480
There was a webcam in the early days of the show.

205
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,560
It would refresh once every 30 seconds as webcams did back then, but there was a cam.

206
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,320
It did work.

207
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,400
So just in TV, y'all.

208
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,600
Yeah, we were on Justin TV.

209
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,200
Yes, we were.

210
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,040
So there actually still is an orange lounge radio Twitch channel.

211
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,760
It just collects cobwebs.

212
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,680
It is our old Justin channel and there's some old content still there.

213
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
If you want to go seek it out.

214
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,360
I mean, have fun.

215
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,640
It's some old shit, but it's there.

216
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,040
Um, you might even find clips of when we were in the garage studio.

217
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,560
So, well, shit.

218
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,280
Now that I've gone down this rabbit hole.

219
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,800
Was it orange lounge or was it orange lounge radio?

220
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,560
I'm trying to look it up.

221
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,120
Oh, some fucker grabbed the name orange lounge.

222
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,920
That's not, that's probably not orange lounge.

223
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,440
I don't think.

224
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,360
No, it's just, it's probably like a fan or something.

225
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:39,880
Okay.

226
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:47,600
I found our channel, but unfortunately all I see are clips of the final fantasy 13 demo being played.

227
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,600
Lord.

228
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,560
Um, I don't know if we have any clips from in the studio.

229
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,360
Oh, I see.

230
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,600
I see some things.

231
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,960
Well, the audio would have been from the podcast.

232
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,160
It's just the video was the 13 demo.

233
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,280
Wait, hold on, hold on.

234
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,680
Okay.

235
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,440
Oh, this is great.

236
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,880
This is great.

237
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,240
Hold on.

238
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,000
So somebody clip this, this clip is 15 years ago.

239
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,280
Hold on.

240
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm going to put this on the other screen.

241
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,840
15 years ago.

242
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,280
This clip is from check this out.

243
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,160
Uh, if you want to give us a call.

244
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,120
I remember this.

245
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,480
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

246
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,920
Who's this?

247
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,040
Oh, wait, who's this?

248
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,320
And there's intern drew.

249
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,640
Yeah.

250
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,400
You can see there.

251
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,600
Loki is wearing a little big planet costume with the OLR logo intern drew's in the back there.

252
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,760
And I believe that's Bradley Arcadian 42 in the back.

253
00:15:44,800 --> 00:16:01,280
And then dark soccer used to sit on a couch that was over on the right side because she didn't want to be on cam, which, you know, if you've ever paid attention to what happens to women on the internet, sometimes I understand our soccer's perspective at that time and not wanting to be on cam.

254
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,200
There's some really wild stuff here in the background to like all this stuff.

255
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
This is like a dear friends poster.

256
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,480
I want to say this is signed in the back.

257
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,480
You know, it's funny.

258
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,440
All the decor in the garage.

259
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,040
What's that?

260
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,240
Drew's picture on my phone is him with the long floppy hair, which of course he doesn't have now.

261
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,880
But I always like I'm so entertained to show co workers.

262
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,360
We worked together.

263
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,160
Look at that.

264
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,440
I'm like, don't don't, you know, he thankfully he grew out of his young republican phase.

265
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,720
Yeah, yeah.

266
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,480
Oh, no.

267
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,880
Oh, no.

268
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,560
Okay, I'm going to do one more one more.

269
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,240
Oh, God, I could fall down a rabbit hole here.

270
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,760
There's a lot of clips on here.

271
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,840
Holy shit.

272
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,560
Oh, my God.

273
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,280
Okay, I got to do one more of these.

274
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,560
This is this one is labeled.

275
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,240
Caramel dancing.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,800
Oh, Lord.

277
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,360
And I have to see what's going on in this clip here.

278
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,080
Hold on, hold on.

279
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,400
Is that Rama in the studio with us?

280
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,000
Holy shit, it is.

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,920
This is when Rama was here.

282
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,560
Yes.

283
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,680
Oh, oh, shit.

284
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,520
I'm not on another screen.

285
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,360
And that started to you with us.

287
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:29,800
There are two in the back and drew with the hair and me face palming during this song.

288
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Don't they dance at some point?

289
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm skipping ahead.

290
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,640
No, I guess this is just our reaction to the song.

291
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,240
I don't know.

292
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,160
That's that's another very, very old clip.

293
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,880
I did not know this much shit was archived over on the old Orange Lounge Radio Twitch channel.

294
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,720
You have to dig a little bit to find it, but it's there.

295
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,040
That's and I know how to and I know how to download every little piece of it.

296
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,920
You might you might think you might need to send me where was the link again?

297
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,000
It's the it's just Twitch TV, Orange Lounge Radio.

298
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,400
And then you have to actually go into the full videos page and the videos page has everything.

299
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,120
It's not in the main page.

300
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,120
I can get it all downloaded.

301
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah, that might be a fun thing to put together.

302
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,960
Let's hear it for developer mode.

303
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,520
Yeah.

304
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,960
Wowee.

305
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,320
Wow.

306
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,840
What a good trip down memory lane.

307
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,200
My God.

308
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,480
Episode 270 post show.

309
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,760
It looks like the cameras pointed at the TV or something.

310
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,040
I don't remember how we were doing it at the time.

311
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,520
Oh, my goodness.

312
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,440
All right.

313
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll see.

314
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,120
Oh, there we go.

315
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,600
Excite truck deathmatch.

316
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,280
All right.

317
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,400
Oh, I'll I'll grab some.

318
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,160
Yeah, dark disease, as I wonder if there's a way to save those clips.

319
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,760
Yeah, that's what Jamie.

320
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,920
Yeah, there absolutely is.

321
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,320
Yeah.

322
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:52,240
So if you are in if you have developer mode enabled in Safari, you can right click on a video and inspect element.

323
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,040
You just have to know how to read the code to find it.

324
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,720
Wow.

325
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,400
That's awesome.

326
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,400
Yeah.

327
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,200
Fun trip down memory lane.

328
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,240
So that's that's why I knew we had a YouTube channel with some old clips, too.

329
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:12,560
But that was that I forgot that we actually have basically a Justin TV channel that got turned into a Twitch channel that has really, really old clips of us doing this thing 15 years ago and probably more.

330
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
That's appreciation.

331
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,600
Wild.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,560
So yeah, I was looking at some of those videos.

333
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,000
There's a lot of wacky stuff in there, but I love it.

334
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,520
I love it.

335
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:21,600
All right.

336
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,480
Well, again, thanks from all of us to you all who come out here and listen every week and just have made this show happen.

337
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,560
So, you know, our next big milestone will be episode 1000.

338
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:44,360
Believe it or not, we're not the first gaming podcast to hit 1000 episodes, but we're the first weekly show one show a week to hit it.

339
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,360
And honestly, in almost any medium I can think of.

340
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,120
I mean, there's some there's others like, you know, there's some shows that have been running like that, like The Simpsons has been running since the dawn of time, right?

341
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,520
But even The Simpsons only does like 20 up.

342
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,600
No, we have more episodes of them.

343
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah.

344
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:12,880
Well, and if you think if you think about traditional radio things like what's Art Bell show called, but a new guy has run it for years coast to coast, you know, things like that have been running for years and years and years and years, right?

345
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,520
So they're always going to have more episodes than us.

346
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,840
But you know, as far as like internet medium things, there's not like for video games.

347
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,680
They're there, we know we're the oldest that that has done this consistently for this long.

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,880
We're the oldest I mean, period.

349
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,960
That's it for video games.

350
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,640
For other mediums.

351
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,480
I'm sure it's, there's probably some tech related shows that have been going about us.

352
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,800
But it's a small circle at this point.

353
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,600
So, um, and big kudos.

354
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,920
I might not be able to download these.

355
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,680
Oh, no, really?

356
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,760
Yeah, they're saying it can't load the the video file off of here.

357
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,680
It's gotta be there, though.

358
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,640
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

359
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,360
I'll get it done.

360
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,520
If you can play it, you can download it.

361
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:02,720
So yeah, but um, yeah, I just want to say, you know, again, not just thanks to all of you, but also, you know, Dark Sakura Loki.

362
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,680
It's our dedication that's had made this happen for 21 years.

363
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,680
So thank you all for you know, being committed to this as long as y'all have as well.

364
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,560
So it's, um,

365
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,880
what else is he gonna do?

366
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,280
I know.

367
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,840
Things hit a hit things.

368
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,040
Things hit that point at some point where it's like, what else am I gonna do Sunday night?

369
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,600
All right.

370
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,200
You know, you know, this has been a very positive part of my life.

371
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,920
You Dan's a podcaster now.

372
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,960
Yeah, he does the pinball stuff, right?

373
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,880
The spinner is lit.

374
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,400
Mm hmm.

375
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,800
So, yeah, it's, uh, yeah.

376
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:47,680
And Alan had a short lived Warcraft podcast for like six episodes, but I always, you know, he gets into streaming, which is pretty cool.

377
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,320
So now we just need Mrs.

378
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,120
Loki to have a rant podcast of her own.

379
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,040
I think she'd be good at it if she wanted to do it.

380
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,560
The only thing she's watching now that she'd rant on is the Beverly Hills Housewives.

381
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,120
I was gonna say it has to be Housewives.

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,120
Which I have watched way too many episodes of already.

383
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,880
Like, I am not happy that I've seen that many episodes.

384
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,120
I would love a Housewives recap podcast for Mrs.

385
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,160
Loki, but it's it's all good.

386
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,160
She can she can enjoy it in peace.

387
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:27,640
Just imagine like living or like being friends with people that bring up like you said something mean to me like two years ago and I still remember it.

388
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,920
And I'm waiting for that apology.

389
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,040
And like, that's the show.

390
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,360
It's just like super annoying.

391
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,040
Yeah.

392
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,920
All right.

393
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,600
Let's see, comments in chat.

394
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:48,360
No one special and 777 says, So when our hits 1000, will we get Rob singing a Madonna voiceover or going full diva and sashaying away?

395
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,800
I already went full diva once on this program.

396
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,120
So be careful what you wish for.

397
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,200
I don't know.

398
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,440
The honest answer is I don't know.

399
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Like you, you hit so many milestones, you're not sure how to tell them all apart at one point.

400
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,760
So, you know, we want to still acknowledge and say thank you.

401
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,480
But, you know, I don't know what we'll do.

402
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,960
Like you start paving things with your milestones.

403
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,080
Yeah, yeah.

404
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:22,280
Such as the background of Street Fighter six that Loki has running there and all the Capcom game milestones you see on the sidewalk there in the background in that earlier scene.

405
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,240
I think it moved into a fighting match, but I caught that in the earlier scene.

406
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,880
I was just hoping there'd be some hot player on refrigerator action, but we haven't seen it yet.

407
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,440
Not yet.

408
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,840
So by the way, I have a theory about this.

409
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,520
And I think that these are really low res, not just because of how we shot them.

410
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,960
I think they were just leftover placeholder.

411
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:51,000
Because, yeah, I can't I can't get it to load up the original clip from the link.

412
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,800
Oh, wow.

413
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,600
I mean, and they're also like copies of copies from Lord knows how long ago that have been.

414
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,920
If I can get logged into the account and go into the video manager, then I can get them that way.

415
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,880
I would bet.

416
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,000
Well, I don't want to talk about the password, but I'll text you.

417
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,720
I'll text you.

418
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,640
So I gotta I gotta watch my mouth on air.

419
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,360
But I have guesses.

420
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,840
Well, and if nothing else, we can probably reset it.

421
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,400
Probably.

422
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,440
Except the account.

423
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,600
Even if the email account doesn't exist anymore, we can create it and then reset it and then

424
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,320
delete it again.

425
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,960
Because it probably it probably honestly goes to mailbag at orange on trader.com.

426
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,000
But we'll figure it out.

427
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,960
It could go to my personal email to at orange on radio.

428
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,460
So we'll see.

429
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,560
Yeah.

430
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,800
Anyway, um, let's get into some actual gaming news.

431
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,600
That's what we do here.

432
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,280
We talk about what's going on in the gaming industry.

433
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,920
And there's actually continued to be quite a bit this week because it was rumored that

434
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,880
it was going to happen.

435
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,400
And then sure enough, Nintendo decided to show up to the not E3 party as well and drop

436
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,520
some bombshells of their own.

437
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,160
So we have a Nintendo Direct to talk about from this week.

438
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,400
Loki, would you mind walking us through some of the headlines from the Nintendo Direct?

439
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,440
Yeah.

440
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:10,920
So they started off with showing off some new Pokemon DLC for Violet and Scarlet, including

441
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,280
Area Zero.

442
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,560
So that looked cool.

443
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,480
I don't know, not playing the game, but we knew they were going to be putting out more

444
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,360
DLC for that.

445
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,560
So of course, it makes sense.

446
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,200
They had another trailer for Sonic Superstars, which is coming out like I think this week.

447
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,640
So it's, you know, of course, on the switch as well.

448
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,480
So looks cool.

449
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,400
Trying to get my kid to play it.

450
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,600
But now I don't know if he's going to.

451
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,200
Paulie was another one.

452
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,240
It's a free to play game, kind of a survival.

453
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,280
I was like town building, but yeah, it looked pretty cool.

454
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,200
And that's going to be coming to the switch as well.

455
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:58,680
Persona 5 Tactica was going to be coming out November 17th and it looked pretty sweet.

456
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,360
This is a neat take on a game, but Myth Force, which is structured.

457
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,920
It's supposed to be like a Saturday morning cartoon.

458
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,720
And I mean, the logo itself kind of reminds me a little bit like Thundercats almost, but

459
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,480
it is supposed to be coming to the switch later this year as well.

460
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,840
And we got some more news about Splatoon 3 Splatfest.

461
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,720
They're going to be doing a toss up between different desserts.

462
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,040
So it looks like frozen yogurt, ice cream.

463
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,080
And I don't know if it's like frozen yogurt as well or maybe I don't know.

464
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,280
Mint chocolate chip or something.

465
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,040
But here's the funny thing about that.

466
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,600
Why wouldn't you'll notice they didn't do chocolate, probably because they didn't want

467
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,760
it look to look like you were flinging poop everywhere.

468
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,880
So they decided to purposely pick something besides just chocolate so that it could be

469
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,240
a better color than brown because the means that would come from brown brown splat, they

470
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,920
just and that's the same reason you're not going to see a yellow or is there a yellow?

471
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,040
I don't think there is a yellow.

472
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,000
He had a medical term.

473
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,080
I probably the vanilla is kind of yellowy.

474
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,040
I don't know.

475
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,520
I don't know.

476
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,680
Well, I'm sure there's probably like a fluorescent yellow, but not like, you know, it's like

477
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,160
well, it's it's.

478
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:24,600
It is it is a like a don't just take the train and derail it immediately.

479
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,720
Here's the thing.

480
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,160
Here's the thing with the Splatfest.

481
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,840
Why the hell was that in the Nintendo Direct?

482
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,920
Like what a fucking buzzkill that was like the Nintendo Directs have consistently been

483
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,360
botching Splatoon news.

484
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,560
Like, I'm just going to say it.

485
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,520
Yeah, the Splatoon stuff in the last direct was also like not great.

486
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,680
And like a Splatfest.

487
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,800
Who cares?

488
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,040
Sorry.

489
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,120
I mean, I'm sorry to Splatoon fans.

490
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,720
Of course you care, but it doesn't need to be like, are they thinking like, oh, oh, fuck,

491
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,160
I got to get Splatoon three because I got to fight about ice cream.

492
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Who was this supposed to win over?

493
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,000
Like, I just I it was a weird thing to have in the direct.

494
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,760
It was a waste of time in the direct.

495
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,840
It was a waste of ice cream, though.

496
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,340
Yeah.

497
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
And it does not look like ice cream.

498
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,520
I'm just saying that.

499
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,960
So they may have missed with they may have avoided the poop thing, but unfortunately

500
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,480
you swung too far the other way.

501
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,000
And yeah, but that is coming out, I guess, July 14th.

502
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,080
It's going to be running through that through the 16th.

503
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,320
So cool.

504
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,840
We got news that there is going to be a new Detective Pikachu returns.

505
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,200
I guess that's the name of the game.

506
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,720
So new Detective Pikachu game.

507
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,760
And it looked cute.

508
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,320
And that is coming out on October six.

509
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,880
Then I mean, I guess the Detective Pikachu news is kind of exciting, but like then they

510
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,000
dropped the bombshell.

511
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,720
The first bomb.

512
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,200
Wait, hold on.

513
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,160
Before I get to the bombshell.

514
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,400
Yeah, I just want to say Detective Pikachu.

515
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,440
I was still disappointed.

516
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,560
It's not Danny DeVito that's doing the voice in there.

517
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,480
People were saying it's Will Arnett, but it's actually not Bobby went over this on his show.

518
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,840
It's actually the same voice actor that does Ichiban's voice, but kind of sounding inspired

519
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,840
by Will Arnett type of thing.

520
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,000
But anyway, you slice it.

521
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,360
It's not Danny DeVito.

522
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,760
And that is quite disappointing.

523
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm sorry to say.

524
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,320
So you have that as well.

525
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,600
So anyway.

526
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,000
Okay, so Loki, this was a big one, right?

527
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,220
Yes.

528
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,560
So they announced that Super Mario RPG is getting a remaster.

529
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,720
And that's going to be coming out this year on November 17th.

530
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,640
And it looks fantastic.

531
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,280
That's awesome.

532
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,480
Yeah, it's extremely hyped for that.

533
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,480
This is one of those things that I really did not think this was ever going to happen.

534
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,000
And here we are.

535
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,960
And it's not just re-releasing the old Super Nintendo game, which I think plenty of people

536
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,480
would have been happy with.

537
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,080
But it looks like they have legit reconstructed it from the ground up.

538
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,400
There's no other way to make the game with this much graphical modernness that this game

539
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,640
has.

540
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,480
This is completely remade from the ground up, which makes me wonder if maybe they're

541
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,920
going to add to it or change it.

542
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,520
You know, it would be cool.

543
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,160
I think people are assuming it's going to be a quote unquote, shot for shot remake.

544
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,280
But why should it?

545
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,640
If they rebuilt this from the ground up, which they would have had to do, maybe they've

546
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,080
made some additions or changes.

547
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,040
I don't think we're going to be talking like Final Fantasy 7 remake type of thing, but

548
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,720
it could be DLC or something.

549
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,200
Yeah.

550
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,040
Well, careful what you wish for.

551
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,160
But yeah, for sure.

552
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,040
Because also they're going to charge full price for this.

553
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,560
This is going to be a $60 game.

554
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Now, I think it's worth it.

555
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,000
It better not be a $70 game.

556
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,800
No, it's $60.

557
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
The price is already out there because you can pre-order it.

558
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,440
And it's eligible for the Nintendo voucher.

559
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,920
So if you still haven't taken advantage of the Nintendo voucher between this and the

560
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,880
Maybe you still need Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

561
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,160
You probably have stuff to spend the voucher on.

562
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,080
So it's worth considering.

563
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,520
And remember, Costco, you can get $100 worth of credit for $90.

564
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,680
So if you use the Costco hack, or there might be other stores that do this, too.

565
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,960
But I just know of Costco.

566
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,280
If you use the Costco hack, you can get two games for $90.

567
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,040
You're taking it down to $45 a game.

568
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,400
That's a pretty good deal.

569
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:27,240
So along with that, they announced that there is a new Princess Peach game coming in next year.

570
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,240
They didn't say much about that.

571
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,800
And we've had a Princess Peach game before.

572
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,480
But it was on the DS.

573
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,040
And it didn't look anything like this.

574
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,640
So I think they're just kind of ignoring that one and making a new Princess Peach game.

575
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:48,680
Because this one, to me, it honestly looked like she had the Dressphere from Final Fantasy

576
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,640
X-2 to me is kind of what I saw here.

577
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,440
But there was very little gameplay at all in this.

578
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,120
You could just see maybe a little bit of the art style.

579
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,800
Maybe looks a little bit Paper Mario.

580
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,440
Just a tad.

581
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,240
Just a tad.

582
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,120
But then you definitely see that she does like, oh, transform.

583
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,480
And now I'm an ice princess.

584
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,840
But don't call me Rosalina.

585
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,760
It looks like a stage almost.

586
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Like everything's a set, which is interesting.

587
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,320
Then Luigi's Mansion Dark Moon is being ported or remastered, I guess, as well.

588
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,560
So that was originally a 3DS game.

589
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,080
And now it's coming to the Switch.

590
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,680
I just want to get some quick comments from chat.

591
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,680
That's funny.

592
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,520
Orange Right says $60.

593
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,040
Technically the budget price now.

594
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,560
OK, maybe not for Nintendo yet.

595
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,360
Vid Power 573 is in chat.

596
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,520
Hello, saying Super Mario RPG was the best thing about that entire Nintendo Direct.

597
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,360
Many people are going to agree with you.

598
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,960
Honestly, that Direct could have been five minutes with just that announcement.

599
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,440
And people would still say it was one of the best Directs they've ever done.

600
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,840
Just because that's the mother load for so many people.

601
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,880
That's the game most people have been waiting for them to remake for a very long time.

602
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,080
So again, honest to God, hear me out.

603
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,240
If they have followed that up with, we're remaking Mother and we're releasing Mother

604
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,160
3 on Virtual Console, that would have literally been the Sony event where they were like Final

605
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,000
Fantasy 7 remake, Shenmue 3, Last Guardian.

606
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,400
We're giving it to everybody today.

607
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,040
Like, like if that if that had been the thought, like this would have been the the the

608
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,680
insurpassable Nintendo Direct if they had put the Mother series out there on the table as

609
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:32,920
well.

610
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,680
But unfortunately, that is indeed too much to ask for Mother 3.

611
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,400
Still, still think about it, y'all.

612
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,200
We're getting Super Mario RPG remade from the ground up for a modern console before

613
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,960
we get a fucking Virtual Console release of Mother 3.

614
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,840
Just a reminder.

615
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:51,720
Yeah.

616
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,160
So and then they had to, you know, bring down the hype, I guess.

617
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,880
So they announced that the Batman Arkham trilogy is coming to the Nintendo Switch.

618
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,720
I mean, it's a good series, but it's just, it's so old.

619
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,240
Yeah, it's old news.

620
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,200
This strategy didn't work for the Wii U.

621
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,360
Why should we care now?

622
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,480
I mean, exactly.

623
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,920
They did that last time.

624
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,320
They brought out the Batman Arkham stuff for the Wii U and it was like super late too.

625
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,200
And it's, yeah, the armored edition.

626
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,240
Cool.

627
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,380
Okay.

628
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,600
Gloomhaven.

629
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,400
It's a dungeon crawler game that's coming September 18th.

630
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,520
So like kind of neat.

631
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,840
Also, another game that I didn't need to see a trailer for, but they announced it anyways.

632
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,280
Again, Just Dance 2024.

633
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,520
What?

634
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,640
It's coming to the Switch?

635
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,760
I never knew that.

636
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,560
Like, it's every year, but they're just like, no, hey, there's another one.

637
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,040
Yay.

638
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,600
Then there was some more RPGs.

639
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,280
We had Silent Hope, which looks interesting.

640
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:10,680
And Fae Farm, which is a fantasy farming game, and that's coming out on September 8th.

641
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,560
The new Hot Wheels Unleashed game, Turbo Charge, is coming out in October.

642
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,600
And that looks pretty cool because the first one is actually pretty sweet as well.

643
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,200
Manic Mechanics, kind of a fun little, like, I think it's like a co-op game.

644
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,720
And we had Mario and Rabbids Sparks of Hope DLC, which this is shown during the Ubisoft

645
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,600
event as well with Rayman in it as well.

646
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,480
So that's going to be out, I think, later this year.

647
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,480
Dragon Quest Monsters, The Dark Prince, is coming in December.

648
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,480
And that one's been new game.

649
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,840
I think it's been out for a long time in Japan.

650
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,920
It's one of those things where it's like we're finally getting it after a very long

651
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,720
time type of thing.

652
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,680
Let's see.

653
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,320
So then we got yet another trailer or extended look at Pikmin four.

654
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,960
I'm just so glad that this game is coming out so I don't have to see it again.

655
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:21,160
Like it's been shown so many times, but there's a demo that's coming out later this week

656
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,480
and it's releasing July 21st.

657
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,040
Thank God.

658
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,200
This is kind of neat.

659
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,560
So Metal Gear Solid Master Collection volume one that has Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear

660
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,040
Solid 2 Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater is coming to the Switch.

661
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,320
And that's on October 24th.

662
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,920
I did not realize that this was also in Sony's press event because I was texting somebody

663
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,080
and I was like, Oh my God, this looks incredible.

664
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,800
And they were like, it was the same thing they showed at Sony's event.

665
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,160
I was like, Oh, well, Sony did theirs while I was working, so I didn't see everything.

666
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,720
So I'm very excited about this collection.

667
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,520
But you know what makes me like, here's the thing.

668
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,640
It's one thing to have all those Metal Gear games, which looks great.

669
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,720
But did you notice that the MSX version of Metal Gear, as well as the MSX version of

670
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,640
the real Metal Gear two in English are in this collection?

671
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,080
Yeah, that's pretty.

672
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,440
That's all I need.

673
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,680
That is literally all I need.

674
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,960
I don't need anything else.

675
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm so excited about those games coming out.

676
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,480
Dark Sakura, you know the Metal Gear MSX stuff.

677
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,120
Surely you've got to be excited to see this coming out too.

678
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,360
I'm excited about this.

679
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,320
That's pretty cool.

680
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,820
Yeah.

681
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah, I know that.

682
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,160
Well, I mean, we've already played through the MSX ones.

683
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,600
Yeah, it was a bonus disc for like Metal Gear Solid 3, something like that.

684
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,960
Well, I'm referring to MSX emulators.

685
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,520
Oh, yeah.

686
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,560
Well, yeah, there's that too.

687
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,060
Yeah.

688
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,100
But it's nice that it's coming in this collection and not in a collector's edition type of thing.

689
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
So, yeah, that's really exciting.

690
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,460
Yeah, that'll be neat.

691
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:58,940
Yes, yes.

692
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Anyway, sorry, Loki, but I had to put that out there.

693
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,740
I was as excited about that as some of you were about the Mario RPG thing, which I'm

694
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,380
excited about too.

695
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:08,940
Don't get me wrong.

696
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,440
Yeah.

697
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,180
Vampire Survivors is going to be coming to the Switch.

698
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:13,980
It may make sense.

699
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,700
It's done well.

700
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,860
Kind of surprised it wasn't already there, honestly.

701
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,660
Yeah, exactly.

702
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,500
There is a game called Headbanger's Rhythm Royale, which features a bunch of pigeons

703
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,660
and you have to move their heads and do stuff in time.

704
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:34,140
It's kind of like a party game slash it almost reminds me a little bit of Fall Guys, but

705
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,740
not with like obstacle courses.

706
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,180
So you're just kind of competing different mini games and getting eliminated as you go

707
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,540
along, which is kind of cool.

708
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Can I quickly just say this comment from chat?

709
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:49,180
VidPower573 says, surprise, they're including the NES Snakes Revenge game in the collection,

710
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,380
the game that Hideo Kojima didn't approve of back in the day.

711
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,860
Kojima's no longer with Konami.

712
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
They don't give a hoot what he thinks at this point.

713
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,020
So I think that's an incentive for Konami.

714
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,380
Honestly, I think it's one of those things where if they hadn't, it's a really easy thing

715
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,940
to include.

716
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,820
And if they hadn't included it, they probably would have gotten crap.

717
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:12,940
I also wonder, I'm assuming there would be a Japanese version of this release as well.

718
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,180
And so it's kind of the opposite for them where it's like, it's the first time.

719
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,620
Well, it's not really the first time we're getting the MSX games, but for many people,

720
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:26,060
I wonder if it's the first time Japan gets to see Snakes Revenge officially, not that

721
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,780
they should care.

722
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,100
But you know, it's kind of one of those.

723
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,900
Oh, now I get-

724
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,260
It's not a bad game, actually.

725
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

726
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,780
Go back.

727
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,260
Go back.

728
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:35,740
Think back.

729
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:42,780
When the game came out, there wasn't really anything else too much like it, you know?

730
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:43,980
I suppose.

731
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,020
It had good music.

732
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,420
It had solid gameplay.

733
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:53,900
Yes, it wasn't an official Metal Gear Solid 2, but it was a pretty decent game and people

734
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,460
shit on it now because, oh, it's not the real sequel.

735
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,180
Meh.

736
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:57,980
No, no, no, no, no.

737
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,540
Go back and actually watch a playthrough of it.

738
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,140
It has some really solid music.

739
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,500
It's not a bad game by any means.

740
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,580
Well, you'll have the chance to-

741
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,460
Why watch a playthrough?

742
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,980
You can play it yourself pretty soon.

743
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,100
Yeah, why play it when I could just watch a playthrough?

744
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,620
All right.

745
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,660
Anyway, sorry, Logan.

746
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,220
Then we have a game called Penny's Big Breakaway.

747
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,660
It's a colorful platformer with lots of penguins.

748
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,340
That looks pretty cool.

749
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,500
We got some news regarding the next boost course pass.

750
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,140
Wave 5 for Mario Kart 8.

751
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:40,460
And they showed off a brand new track that was inside of a bathroom.

752
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:47,820
And they also have new players, new characters, I guess, coming to the game as well.

753
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:56,940
So we have Wiggler and Kamek from Mario Kart Tour and also the Piranha Plant from Mario Kart 7.

754
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,060
I don't remember which one it was.

755
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,220
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

756
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,180
Mario Kart 7 had Wiggler and Kamek and Mario-

757
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,660
Kamek's from Mario Kart Tour.

758
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,180
Wiggler's from Mario Kart 7.

759
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,340
Don't remember where the Piranha Plant thing was from.

760
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:10,940
One of them.

761
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,020
I think those are the two new ones or three new ones.

762
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Star Ocean Second Story R is getting a 2.5D remake.

763
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,860
This is a big deal.

764
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,780
Yeah, that looked pretty cool.

765
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,420
Let's see.

766
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,220
This was sweet.

767
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,380
We're getting a new WarioWare game.

768
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,820
So WarioWare movement.

769
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,220
Can I say just quickly, though, about the Star Ocean remake?

770
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,060
It very much looks like that same engine for Octopath, Triangle Strategy,

771
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,140
this to me looks like it was built in that same engine.

772
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,820
I mean, it doesn't look exactly the same, but it definitely like it's that same style

773
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,060
of like the pixel art on the rendered backgrounds.

774
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:57,900
And so this very much bodes well for continuing remakes over at Square Enix for some of these.

775
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,860
The more and more of these that come out, the more I go, you know what?

776
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,620
Chrono Trigger isn't out of the question.

777
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,580
I don't want to set the bar too high, but Chrono Trigger is not out of the question.

778
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,020
Even just Star Ocean two is huge for a lot of people.

779
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,980
The fact that that's coming.

780
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,020
So anyway, sorry, Logie.

781
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,620
Yeah, so like pretty cool WarioWare move.

782
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,700
It is going to be a brand new WarioWare game using motion controls.

783
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,740
And I mean, they had me in the first half.

784
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,340
Exactly.

785
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,860
Like I love WarioWare, but the games looked ridiculous.

786
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,860
I'm not I mean, it's something for kids.

787
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,060
That's what I'm chalking it up to.

788
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,620
That's fine.

789
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,940
Not everything for Nintendo has to be for me.

790
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,500
And then we had the last bit of like, eh, it's news.

791
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:50,620
They tease Nintendo Live Seattle 2023, where you can go check out stuff in person.

792
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,540
That's going to be September 1st and they're open registration

793
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,580
or they already have open registration for that.

794
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,700
And then, of course, new me, both for Tears of the Kingdom.

795
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,380
So Zelda and Gendorf.

796
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:09,100
And then they ended with a brand new 2D Mario game, Super Mario Brothers Wonder.

797
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:09,660
Finally.

798
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,820
And it looks awesome and is coming out in October.

799
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,980
Yeah, the new 2D Mario look great.

800
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,340
It had an elephant.

801
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,300
Mario is now like the new thing everybody's leeching on to.

802
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,980
Like, you know, you had cat Mario and then you had a tanuki suit Mario.

803
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,660
You know, there's always like some new Mario suit that people go wild for.

804
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,300
And now Elephant Mario is the new one.

805
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,900
It looks it looks neat.

806
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,020
The game itself.

807
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,860
I didn't think the trailer made it look it looked weird to me.

808
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,340
I feel like it'll look better in long form gameplay than it did in the trailer to me.

809
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:47,580
I mean, I love 2D Mario games, so I'll pick it up regardless.

810
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,380
But yeah, I mean, it looks pretty amazing.

811
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,220
I'm surprised it took them this long with the movie, but maybe this is something they

812
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,820
were trying to get out with the movie.

813
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:00,140
And for whatever reason, be it, you know, pandemic went on longer, you know, technically

814
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,020
still going, but, you know, lockdowns went on longer than anyone could thought of or

815
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,340
whatever.

816
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:08,140
I don't know if it was just a miscalculation on that part, but it is nice to see that it's

817
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,540
happening.

818
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:16,140
Also nice to see now what Nintendo is doing with their holiday, because remember when

819
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,020
they were trying to make us believe they're not doing anything this holiday?

820
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,940
I was like, that is not true.

821
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,460
I don't believe that for one damn minute.

822
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,220
And so now, OK, here we go.

823
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,420
Mario RPG, a new 2D Mario.

824
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,700
OK, now we're getting a bigger picture as well as like what they're actually working

825
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,740
on for the holiday.

826
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,500
And that's that's pretty cool to see.

827
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:41,180
Some folks also out there on the Internet believe that that was not Charles Martinet

828
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,740
voicing Mario in the trailer, which is.

829
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,860
Leading to a lot of interesting thoughts.

830
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,900
Sorry, I heard a thud, thud, thud, and it's just Cheddar trying to open one of our cabinets

831
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,100
because he's a little brat.

832
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,100
You know what?

833
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,420
I hear that with Midna trying to open doors and cabinets by head butting them.

834
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,300
She understands physics.

835
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,260
What the hell is that?

836
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,340
Thud noise is like the neighbor banging on the wall.

837
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,620
No, it's just Cheddar trying to open a cabinet off, off cam.

838
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:08,940
All right.

839
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,020
Oh, you got this Cheddar.

840
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,020
Alan just overheard what I was saying.

841
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,740
Alan went and.

842
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,540
Threatened him with a finger and Cheddar ran away.

843
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,740
This Cheddar is a scaredy cat.

844
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,860
OK, the dark tattoo says, yeah, my wife's cat will do that.

845
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,060
She'll hide in the cabinets.

846
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,980
Dude, if if Cheddar gets in the cabinet, I don't think he's going to be able to have

847
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,660
the physical energy to push himself out.

848
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:31,980
I don't know.

849
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,060
Maybe he will, but I just I worry he'll get in there and he'll be like, oh, no.

850
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,020
How did I get in here?

851
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:37,820
How do I get out?

852
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,620
Anyway.

853
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:40,940
All right.

854
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,540
What else?

855
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,580
Oh, Charles Martinet may not be the voice of Mario.

856
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,660
Maybe this is all alleged, but some people are, you know, sleuthing the trailer.

857
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,020
I have a couple of thoughts about that.

858
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:57,740
I feel like Nintendo may be realizing that that the voice of Mario cannot just be wahoo,

859
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,060
and all this for a while.

860
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,820
And they have to maybe because of the movie, they're going to have to look at how can Mario

861
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,660
speak in full sentences in the games.

862
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,660
And so they may be looking to recast the voice actor for that reason.

863
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:17,740
I do not think a certain crispy rodent will be doing the voice at the video game level,

864
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,500
but they'll probably get someone to emulate him, just like, you know, we were talking

865
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,420
about Detective Pikachu and who are who it may or may not be emulating.

866
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,900
Um, and here's the other thing.

867
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,500
What's the condition of his voice?

868
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:30,300
Yeah.

869
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,940
I was going to say Charles Martinet is also in his late sixties.

870
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,100
And if he wants to have a beautiful retirement, he's earned every minute of it.

871
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,700
If he wants to just go around to conventions and collect money for signing autographs and

872
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,500
doing selfies, that is his fucking right at this point.

873
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,140
So I think we also have to, yeah, there's

874
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,980
June four eight went well into her, you know, nineties.

875
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:50,780
True.

876
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,280
True.

877
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,640
But, um, you know, there's, but, but she, she won it.

878
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,280
Well, didn't she have a break for a while?

879
00:46:59,280 --> 00:46:59,840
A long while.

880
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,800
And then she kind of came back.

881
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,680
Yeah, off and on.

882
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,160
I mean, I think she was just doing it as she could.

883
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,400
Yeah.

884
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,880
I mean, Charles Martinet may come back for a Mario multiverse.

885
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,400
Well, and again, we're assuming he's gone.

886
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,200
He might not be, but people, you know, the internet's doing its thing.

887
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,400
And I think we do need to kind of realize the Mario movie may have changed some things

888
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,480
and just the evolving technology may have decided to have an impact on the directorial

889
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,280
approach to Mario.

890
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,160
So I'm just trying to prepare everyone for the fact that Charles Martinet may not be

891
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,760
associated with Mario moving forward, but obviously he will always be the voice of Mario

892
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,960
to many of us in our hearts.

893
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,920
But, you know, he joined, he joins a legacy of many awesome Mario's, um, including, you

894
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,920
know, captain Lou, you know, any, many other people that have voiced him in the past.

895
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,200
But, um, you know, anyway.

896
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,960
I mean, think about how many of the modern, you know, cartoons out there where they've

897
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,320
had people, um, you know, new voice actors in the role because someone's died or retired.

898
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,560
I mean, think of how many cartoons had replaced, uh, character voices when Casey Kasem died.

899
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,200
I mean, he was a lot of Transformers voices.

900
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,520
He, um, was, uh, uh, Shaggy, wasn't he?

901
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,040
Yeah, he was Shaggy.

902
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,240
So, yeah.

903
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
But now they got Matthew Lillard to do it, so.

904
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,080
Which is, he's fantastic too.

905
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,040
Yeah.

906
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,640
But I mean, I'm just, I'm just saying there's, there's even, you know, modern, you know, mouse.

907
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,240
Well, yeah, I think about, um, not, not because the person died at the time.

908
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,400
Unfortunately, they're no longer with us now, but I think about Aladdin and how Robin Williams

909
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,840
did it in the movie, but then for the sequel, and I think there was a TV show, uh, Dan Castaneda,

910
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,560
I think is his name.

911
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,840
The guy that does Homer Simpson.

912
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,400
Homer.

913
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,640
Yeah.

914
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,440
Does the voice.

915
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,480
No, it's a good, yeah.

916
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,440
Like it was, it was, it was a great job.

917
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,400
Like it almost like it's a talented voice actor.

918
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:52,560
Yeah.

919
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,480
It was jarring at first, but then like, as you watch the show, you just got used to it and it's

920
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,560
like, Oh, and then you go back and watch the original movie.

921
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,160
Like, Oh wait, that's jarring now.

922
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,120
Like that's weird.

923
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,800
But yeah, he did a great job.

924
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,200
Yeah.

925
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,560
So, you know, that's, that's my thought is they're probably going to get someone to give a more,

926
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,120
uh, crisp rodent type of approach to the character that you saw in the movie

927
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,000
to try to bring those universes a little tighter together,

928
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,560
especially because the movie's getting a sequel.

929
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,400
Like, no question.

930
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,440
No, we're getting a sequel to the movie period.

931
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,480
Uh, the movie did too damn well for us not to.

932
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,680
Um, so the, and you know, you know, obviously these things are planned years in advance,

933
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,960
but I think Nintendo probably took a safe bet that this was going to be a universe

934
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,560
to build on for a long time.

935
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,600
So anyway, some talk about Matthew Lillard and chat, uh, fix, fix.

936
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,840
He is actually saying Matthew is no longer shaggy.

937
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,640
He was replaced for the newer scoop movie.

938
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,800
Uh, and then some folks pointing out that Matthew Lillard will continue to be booked

939
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,280
and blessed anyway, because he's in the five nights universe now with that movie coming out.

940
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,520
So, uh, it's yeah, but I just, I just happened roles change.

941
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,440
He's such a, like a good actor as well.

942
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:12,960
Like my wife, once again, really into like horrible, um, dramas, uh, but she used to

943
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,440
watch a lot of, Oh God, what was it now?

944
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,080
Good girls.

945
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,080
And Matthew Lillard was in there.

946
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,560
He played a character named Dean who is absolutely hated because he was just like such a,

947
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,080
he wasn't a horrible character, but he was, he's a, he's a weak male character in the

948
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,360
show type of thing.

949
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,000
But like out of like all the cast, like he's like the most humble and the most like approachable

950
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,960
and just overall genuinely nice guy.

951
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,280
Yeah.

952
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,800
So, uh, he was in twin peaks, uh, the, the reboot, uh, twin peaks, 21 years.

953
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,040
What was the name of the reboot?

954
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,000
Not season three.

955
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,160
Oh, the return twin peaks, the return.

956
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
He was in that for like one or two episodes.

957
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
He wasn't in it very long, but he was in that too.

958
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,840
So yeah, he's, he gets around.

959
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,240
Good guy.

960
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,040
All right.

961
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,560
Anyway, back to the Nintendo direct.

962
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,800
Uh, how did you feel about it overall?

963
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,120
I thought I, I actually watched it live.

964
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,040
While I did emails, cause I didn't have any calls that early, thankfully, but I did emails

965
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:05,440
on one screen.

966
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,720
I was kind of like watching the other and I was like, dang, dang, you know, like it was,

967
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,200
it was definitely an E3 level presentation.

968
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,000
I mean, there was a lot of filler, but there was a lot of, there was a lot of tent pole

969
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,400
announcements to justify it too, you know?

970
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,280
And in the sense that like, again, for me, I don't really give a hoot about Pikmin 4,

971
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,080
but I realized that is someone else's tent pole game.

972
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,760
Um, and that's cool.

973
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,800
So yeah, there was like, they did have some something for everyone.

974
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,240
Not that I don't like Pikmin 4, it's just that they've, I've seen it so much.

975
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,280
They're like, they're, they're getting to no man's sky type of level of showing that

976
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:41,920
game off.

977
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,280
Like, and then they'll probably still be another full direct for it.

978
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:45,920
Of course.

979
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,080
And then there's going to be the DLC and stuff.

980
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,040
It's like, I just like, I don't care about Pikmin that much.

981
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,280
Like, just stop showing it to me.

982
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,640
That's the thing is like, I get it.

983
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,960
I know what's coming out, but like, chill, please.

984
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,640
The Pikmin game I do play regularly, Pikmin Bloom has already announced that they're

985
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,000
going to do a tie in event as well.

986
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,800
But they're just repeating what they already did for Pikmin 3.

987
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,960
When that released.

988
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,280
Oh yeah.

989
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,720
And then Pikmin 1 and 2 are out.

990
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,400
So at least if you are a Pikmin fan, like every game is on the Switch now.

991
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,440
That's not the mobile game.

992
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,120
So that's neat.

993
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,720
It is nice to have everything on one platform.

994
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,880
So all right.

995
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,720
Um, let's move on.

996
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,320
That was a lot of news, but it was a, it was a good, uh, it was a good direct chock full

997
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,920
of a lot of stuff that there's something in there you're looking forward to.

998
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,080
There was something in there you're looking forward to.

999
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,160
If not Mario RPG, then maybe Star Ocean, you know, or Metal Gear collection or something

1000
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,360
you're looking forward to in that, that, um, direct.

1001
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:41,600
Okay.

1002
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,880
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, the types of video games that we have been playing this

1003
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,040
week while we wait for all these other games to come out.

1004
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,960
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

1005
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,720
Um, I played, uh, Dead by Daylight, of course playing the, um, the seventh anniversary

1006
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,840
business, um, which is, is pretty fun stuff.

1007
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:06,240
Still a lot of stinky killers, but I was doing some offline play with Fixie and with Shayla

1008
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,080
and, um, and I was having fun.

1009
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,320
Of course I played Midnight Suns last night.

1010
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:18,000
Um, you know, cause honestly enough, that's like my, my break from everything.

1011
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,760
It's the end of my work week.

1012
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,280
I need to do something that I can just whatever on.

1013
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,600
Um, so, so yeah, I played that last night.

1014
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,040
And of course, uh, I did not play Cult of the Lamb.

1015
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,640
I actually did not stream on Juneteenth because that's not my day.

1016
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,520
It, it was a day to focus on our, uh, our, uh, by POC folks.

1017
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,040
And so I didn't stream on that day.

1018
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:50,560
Um, also been playing my stupid word scapes game because I'm an addict and a word nerd

1019
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,280
and it was great.

1020
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,600
And, um, yeah.

1021
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,520
But of course I played pinball because I played pinball.

1022
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,200
So that's it.

1023
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,080
All right.

1024
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,160
Oh, and Dan played, Dan was playing BurgerTime.

1025
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:05,920
Hey, that's a good choice.

1026
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,280
I got a BurgerTime machine behind me.

1027
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,800
It's a good choice of game to play.

1028
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:10,820
All right.

1029
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,060
Uh, Loki, how was your game week?

1030
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,700
Uh, I mean, I played Minecraft.

1031
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,220
What?

1032
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,020
You never play that.

1033
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,300
I know it's a shock.

1034
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,780
I, yeah, let's just like constantly do that.

1035
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,020
No, I took time off to play more Minecraft actually.

1036
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,660
Um, didn't get as much done as I wanted to though.

1037
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,940
Cause I was trying to get a jump on content creation for the week.

1038
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,700
I did put out my episode earlier this week though, which I did a lot in already.

1039
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,780
And you know, I'm still working on the two last areas, the two last robot masters.

1040
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:46,660
So I have stuff like for that, I built another, um, or I will be building a another giant,

1041
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,140
uh, mega man to enemy.

1042
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,540
So there'll be another one of those.

1043
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:59,060
Um, so I did finish that and then, uh, just to try and figure out what I want to put in

1044
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:05,940
some of these areas, it's, it's as the end of the season is getting closer, it is harder.

1045
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,540
I am getting to that creativity, uh, burnout.

1046
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,820
Well, it's just, I guess, uh, some of this, cause the initial concept for all the robot

1047
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:19,700
masters, they didn't really have like a strong, like, Oh, here's what I want to do for all of

1048
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:19,860
them.

1049
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,260
So some of them it's like, Whoa, what do I do for this?

1050
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,140
I don't know.

1051
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:28,260
Like in it's kind of sitting there for days until finally something clicks and then you

1052
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:28,900
just build it.

1053
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:36,500
Um, so I'm kind of in that mode right now where like I am building frog man's area,

1054
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,620
which is in the swamp.

1055
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:45,700
So there's, you know, uh, I built a Willow tree that looks cool that I'm going to be

1056
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:51,140
decorating stuff with, um, and did some like, uh, paths and stuff, but like, I don't know

1057
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,980
like what structures to build there.

1058
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:56,900
I was like, thought about, Oh, cause it's kind of slime based stuff.

1059
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:03,540
So like, uh, not sewage, but like a toxic waste processing plant or something like that.

1060
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,940
But that kind of looks like the same stuff that I have on in another area as well.

1061
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,940
So I was like, I don't know if I want to do that.

1062
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,740
So I'm just going back and forth, figuring out what I'm going to do for that.

1063
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,940
Hopefully I get past that hurdle pretty soon.

1064
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:20,820
And then the last bit is going to be Wiley's castle, which at least that I know what that

1065
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:20,980
is.

1066
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,740
I mean, that that's pretty easy.

1067
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,460
Um, so yeah, wrapping things up there a little bit.

1068
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,740
Um, I did, I was hoping to get it this week, but I haven't gotten it yet.

1069
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:36,180
I ordered a, um, because Facebook keeps advertising to me this nonsense.

1070
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:40,660
They have all these like wood kits that you can buy to build things.

1071
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,780
Um, and they kind of like a slot together.

1072
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,380
So this one is a wooden pinball machine.

1073
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:54,500
It's like a tabletop, like, I don't know, 12, 18 inch machine that actually has the,

1074
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
all the electronics for it and everything.

1075
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,140
So that's gonna be fun.

1076
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,580
I can't wait to put that together and, uh, play a little bit of pinball with that.

1077
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,100
Nice.

1078
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,580
It's circus theme that has a circus.

1079
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,540
Thankfully, the circus music can be turned off.

1080
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,900
They put a switch in.

1081
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:13,460
Thank you manufacturers for doing that because that would have been irritating, but yeah,

1082
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,260
it'll be neat to kind of put that together.

1083
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:16,760
Cool.

1084
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,340
All right.

1085
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,860
Uh, well, that's it for your gaming week.

1086
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:24,420
Then my gaming week, um, I continued to play Diablo four, uh, still in the end game for

1087
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,060
that.

1088
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,260
Uh, so it was playing that a little bit.

1089
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:30,180
I was even playing some dead by daylight, uh, a little bit, especially with the, uh, anniversary

1090
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,460
event having just started, you know, I got to make sure I get some cakes, uh, that I

1091
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,140
can use year round on one of my characters.

1092
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,580
So there was that as well.

1093
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,500
Um, but obviously if you know me and you've been paying any attention over the last few

1094
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,820
weeks, you know, that the day final fantasy 16 came out, I've been on board with that

1095
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,540
a hundred percent.

1096
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,460
I've been playing that since, uh, the demo kind of picking that up from the demo, um,

1097
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,420
and continuing on with the game.

1098
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:55,300
So obviously I'm not done yet, but I've, I've sunk a good, I don't know, maybe 12 hours

1099
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:55,700
into it.

1100
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,380
It's, it's literally all on actually at this point, YouTube, because I've been doing something

1101
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,180
I don't usually do.

1102
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,460
So when I usually stream narrative games, I'll stream the main quest and I'll play side

1103
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,980
quests off stream.

1104
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,220
But what I'm doing is that I'm still recording myself doing side quests and I'm putting it

1105
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,100
on YouTube.

1106
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,340
So all of my gameplay is over on YouTube.

1107
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:21,220
Um, over on my, my personal channel there, Rob Roberts plays, don't just go to Rob Roberts

1108
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,580
cause that's somebody that sells guns, go to Rob Roberts plays.

1109
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,260
And that's my YouTube channel and I have my full 16 play through, or of course you can

1110
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,700
follow me on Twitch on there.

1111
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,100
So I'm still in progress with the game.

1112
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,980
I obviously I'm going to make sure I keep it spoiler free.

1113
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,420
I'm not going to do that to you.

1114
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,780
Um, but you know, I've, I've been going through some very key elements of the story just finished.

1115
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:49,380
I will say a story mission where I got the prompt that said, you are about to do a pivotal

1116
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,820
story in the game and, uh, you will only be able to do certain things from here.

1117
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,340
Uh, the type of warning you would get in Final Fantasy 14 before a major quest.

1118
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,460
So there were, there was that.

1119
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:05,620
So, um, yeah, I, I I've been exploring the game and, um, I do still really like it.

1120
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,860
I do think what's happened.

1121
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,420
And I think this is actually very clever on their part.

1122
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:17,300
They really front loaded a lot of the story, meaning that two hour demo or the prologue

1123
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:22,900
or the early years of Clive, as it were, uh, that they released as that demo 10 days ago

1124
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,020
was very stacked with story and stuff.

1125
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:32,180
Because when you start the retail game, after that point, the pacing slows way down to what

1126
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:37,380
you would expect in a more traditional RPG, which is let's go find the hub.

1127
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,540
Let's explain these systems.

1128
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,780
Let's go through some of these maps that are a little bit linear while we're still explaining

1129
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,340
and laying the groundwork for the Y and all this.

1130
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:52,420
It's not bad, but it's a real jarring, like pacing shift from what happens in that demo.

1131
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,500
It does start to pick back up and there are some more story moments that kick in.

1132
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:01,300
You do get it's, it is not, even though some of the early levels, you'll start to be like,

1133
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:06,100
Oh no, we've got Final Fantasy 13 syndrome going on here where the maps are very tunnel-y.

1134
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,020
They, they do, they fix that real quick.

1135
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,940
And you do get some really big open maps, more like you might see in something like

1136
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:15,700
Final Fantasy 14, again, is a really good mold for what you get here.

1137
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,780
It's like a single-player Final Fantasy 14 game.

1138
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:24,660
But I also understand now playing through this, why Final Fantasy and Square Enix, you know,

1139
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:30,420
and why they're having this crisis about should we even number Final Fantasy games anymore?

1140
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:37,620
Because the series has taken a big shift from the earlier turn-based RPGs.

1141
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,860
Now, unlike some of the articles I've been reading out there on the internet, which do

1142
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:42,980
not make sense to me.

1143
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:48,020
And I start to wonder, have some journalists played a Final Fantasy game before?

1144
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,700
Have you watched the show Tamar?

1145
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:53,540
Like, it's very that like, have some of you journalists played a Final Fantasy game before?

1146
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:58,980
Because 16 is not the first time that the game went action-based combat.

1147
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,940
That, that's, that's actually what everyone was ticked off about in 15, the last Final

1148
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,900
Fantasy game that came out.

1149
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:12,260
I assure you, the combat in 16, way better, light years better than Final Fantasy 15.

1150
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:18,660
It's, it's very satisfying to control and the accessories that you can do and all that

1151
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:23,860
really help you be able to skill the fights down to what you want.

1152
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:29,700
But it does take a lot of the quintessential turn-based elements.

1153
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,180
Casting magic is different.

1154
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,300
It's there, but it's different.

1155
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,060
Limit breaks are there, but they're different.

1156
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,940
So it's that the fact that it is a little war rooted in action is going to, you know,

1157
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,220
rub some people the wrong way.

1158
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:50,660
But this is a direction the franchise has slowly been moving in since Final Fantasy

1159
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,220
11.

1160
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,540
11 was the first one that got rid of turns.

1161
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,620
They had to because it was a live MMO.

1162
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,660
And then some of that was incorporated into 12.

1163
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,780
12 didn't have turns.

1164
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:07,940
And then even in 13, yeah, you, you kind of had the more turns, but it's still, you were

1165
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:11,220
setting up things at a time and it was still playing out live.

1166
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,660
13 was them kind of trying to marry the two a little bit.

1167
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:17,300
But then, you know, ever since then, it's been a little more action-based.

1168
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,540
But I understand that the series has departed a little bit from what it used to be.

1169
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,340
And that's going to rub some people the wrong way.

1170
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,460
I understand.

1171
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:30,180
But I still think the game stands on its own as a solid game.

1172
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:35,620
But I understand, you know, it's been a journey from Final Fantasy 1.

1173
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,780
And it's not a journey everyone wants to follow.

1174
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:45,700
Now, I understand that series like Octopath Traveler, Bravely Default.

1175
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,460
There's other series out there for folks that missed that.

1176
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:52,500
But I understand that there's people that want to see that rooted in Final Fantasy.

1177
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:59,220
That all being said, if you look at the Final Fantasy series as having always been a trailblazer

1178
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:05,300
series of sorts, you know, like with things like the active time battle and things playing

1179
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,660
out a little more live, you know, like it did in Final Fantasy 4.

1180
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,780
And, you know, the gambit system and some of the things that, you know, Final Fantasy

1181
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,900
has really changed the game.

1182
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,180
And, you know, you kind of look at this as just the series continuing to evolve.

1183
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,860
I think it is.

1184
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:18,900
I think it is really neat.

1185
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,620
I think it's good.

1186
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:24,020
The story, again, heavy adult themes.

1187
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,340
Some people are going to be really thrown.

1188
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,780
Um, but it's holding up.

1189
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,460
The story is very interesting.

1190
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,940
I thought at first it was getting a little predictable, but then they kind of did a gotcha

1191
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,580
type of moment.

1192
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,500
And I was like, oh, okay, interesting.

1193
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:45,220
I guess the only maybe small drawback I would have is that I have noticed that some of the

1194
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:49,700
dungeons get a little like I was in a dungeon.

1195
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,340
I was even on stream and I was kind of commenting like, okay, I'm ready to be done with this

1196
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,860
and to advance the plot.

1197
01:03:55,860 --> 01:04:01,460
Because I feel like I'm doing trash, trash miniboss, trash, trash, and it starts to fall

1198
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:06,820
into that dangerous pattern from 14, which is something that 14 has been criticized about

1199
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:13,060
is that a lot of 14 is very formulaic, especially when it comes to the end game dungeons.

1200
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,340
Every single one of them, trash pack, trash pack, first boss, trash pack, they're all

1201
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:19,140
the same.

1202
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,340
They all look great.

1203
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,540
They all sound great.

1204
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,980
They all have different mechanics.

1205
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:26,420
But there's a certain formula that they have a hard time breaking.

1206
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:30,500
And I'm a little worried 16 may fall victim to some of that.

1207
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:35,140
But that isn't as hard of a read on the game as you might think.

1208
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:39,780
I actually think there's a lot again, the combat for me not playing a lot of these type

1209
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,980
of action games.

1210
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:43,060
It's really fucking satisfying.

1211
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:47,460
And the way you weave in and out abilities like, oh, you're doing Phoenix's move and

1212
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:52,180
then you swap to a different icon like instantly you're doing their moves and swapping again.

1213
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,540
It's really satisfying and feels really good.

1214
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,420
So I'm excited to see from here where the story keeps going.

1215
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:01,220
But the early hours have really pulled me in.

1216
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:01,940
That's for sure.

1217
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:08,660
SSG100Matt says if OLR is 21 and old enough to drink, Final Fantasy 16 is sneaking into

1218
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:10,420
its first R-rated movie.

1219
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:14,260
Well, what's interesting about that, and I was reminded on Twitter, one of our listeners,

1220
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:19,620
Ziba, hi, if you're listening, reminded me on Twitter, hey, actually 16 was not the first

1221
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:21,540
game where they were killing chocobos.

1222
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,260
Do you remember Final Fantasy Type Zero?

1223
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:27,380
And I was like, oh, yeah, I do remember that game.

1224
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:32,980
I didn't like it, but it did have the adult themes were kind of in that game too.

1225
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:35,700
And it was another one of those like war type of games.

1226
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:40,420
I think the battle in that I did not like the battle system in that game, but it's interesting.

1227
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,940
Why couldn't I mean, I'm glad it wasn't, but why couldn't Final Fantasy Type Zero have

1228
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:46,980
been a mainline game?

1229
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:53,940
Why couldn't Stranger of Paradise Final Fantasy Origin have been a Final Fantasy one part

1230
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,620
zero game?

1231
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,900
Like these, it is interesting.

1232
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:08,500
And the Final Fantasy team is having a crisis of and why does Final Fantasy 13 versus get

1233
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,260
upgraded to Final Fantasy 15?

1234
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:15,300
Well, that's because long development time, but like I was going to say, why don't they

1235
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:20,020
why don't they just have spin off series like they did with like a dragon, you know,

1236
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:26,180
where they had that it was its own, which is a term based action game, you know, and

1237
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:26,980
that's amazing.

1238
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:27,860
And that did well.

1239
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,380
And you can have narrative and stuff.

1240
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,460
So you can have your KD too.

1241
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:36,260
You can make your action games for the folks that like action stuff, and then you make

1242
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:40,980
your traditional Final Fantasy games for the people like the traditional stuff.

1243
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:43,540
And then you can even go in the middle and make something, you know, kind of a little

1244
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,020
bit of each.

1245
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:50,820
But like, I don't I don't really buy into like the excuse that, well, you know, a lot

1246
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,900
of people just nowadays they don't like term based stuff because they didn't grow up with

1247
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,020
it and blah, blah, blah.

1248
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:57,300
It's like, yeah, but like.

1249
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:03,700
I don't think that people aren't playing like some of the classic RPGs because they're

1250
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,260
turn based.

1251
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,260
I and I yeah, I also disagree.

1252
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:11,220
Now, while I'm fine with the choice that they made in 16 to do what they do with the battle

1253
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,260
system, I'm fine with it.

1254
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:19,780
Yeah, that comment is very short sighted of like Dungeons and Dragons is bigger than ever.

1255
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:24,660
Thanks to the pandemic and, you know, podcasting as well.

1256
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:31,540
Like I would say more kids today know Dungeons and Dragons than probably when we were all

1257
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:31,860
kids.

1258
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,500
I mean, sure.

1259
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,540
Of course, D&D was the thing.

1260
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,180
We were all kids.

1261
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,220
Most of us played it.

1262
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:39,220
But I mean, just in the popular lexicon and how many people play it and are exposed to

1263
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,220
it, I would actually argue it's more today.

1264
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,100
So don't tell me people don't know turn based RPGs.

1265
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:44,660
That's a lie.

1266
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:48,180
Well, it's also the same argument that they tried to make before where they said single

1267
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,420
player games are popular anymore.

1268
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,660
And then, like, well, that came all their life.

1269
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,540
Service game item.

1270
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,660
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1271
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,220
And all it's like, that's not true at all.

1272
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:00,420
Like, and then they have the eat crow on that as well.

1273
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:04,100
But I mean, obviously, the reason they made that argument the first was because they want

1274
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:07,460
to go live service so they can monetize the crap out of it.

1275
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,780
They're like, Well, see, you guys wanted this.

1276
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,580
It's like, no, no, no one did.

1277
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:17,940
And that's the thing, too, with Final Fantasy 16 is I think a lot of it, it could be almost

1278
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:22,180
like you're changing it so much that you're going to lose the people that were like kind

1279
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,500
of fans of Final Fantasy to begin with.

1280
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,700
And that's kind of the thing, too.

1281
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:31,940
For me, like even with a 15, like it was so radically different than, you know, maybe

1282
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:36,820
like not as radically different as 13, but like it was different enough to where like

1283
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,180
I didn't stick with it.

1284
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:41,700
And normally, like I will finish all of those Final Fantasy games.

1285
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:47,380
But that was like one of the first ones that in type zero that I didn't really want to

1286
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,340
finish.

1287
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,820
And that's why I was kind of like, well, aside from the fact it's on PlayStation five and

1288
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:57,620
I don't own a PlayStation five, that's the only reason I'd hesitate on Final Fantasy

1289
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:58,340
16.

1290
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:03,780
And and like even the review that I watched from a reviewer that I respect, didn't like

1291
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,420
the game.

1292
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:10,820
And they didn't like it because that it felt like there was very little in the sense of

1293
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:17,220
gameplay and a ton of cut scenes, like 75% of the game is cut scenes, which there are

1294
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:22,100
better ways to like tell your story and have cut scenes incorporated with that.

1295
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,540
But I would be curious, what did that what did that reviewer think of persona then?

1296
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:27,940
They like persona.

1297
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:33,700
Okay, so so so so I'm sorry, but that's that do you see where I'm like that they just

1298
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,660
contradicted themselves.

1299
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,020
Right.

1300
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:42,820
I think though, that in this sense, it was more of like, you know, you can have cut scenes

1301
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:49,220
that are like kind of like God of War, for example, God of War has story cut scenes that

1302
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,820
are in the gameplay.

1303
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,620
It's not just like, okay, I'm doing game and stop.

1304
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,460
And now you got to watch cut scene.

1305
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:03,300
You know, it's your interacting with it, you it's it's told in a dynamic way that doesn't

1306
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,460
interrupt the gameplay flow.

1307
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:05,960
Yeah.

1308
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:07,780
Yeah.

1309
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,740
I mean, I don't know.

1310
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:12,100
Like I think the cut scenes are fine as for a Final Fantasy game.

1311
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:16,740
I'm not bothered with it because I feel like all like all Final Fantasy games since like

1312
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:22,180
seven fuck even like four and six and five had like very long sequences where you weren't

1313
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:22,820
doing anything.

1314
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,620
I mean, probably not as bad in the Super Nintendo era, but especially when you started

1315
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:26,660
getting to seven.

1316
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,380
And so that like the cut scenes are like a mainstay in it.

1317
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,980
And you know, you're kind of there for the story.

1318
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:37,460
But I mean, I can see where maybe some of my complaints about how some of the formulaic

1319
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,500
layout and then you combine that with the cut scene.

1320
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:45,940
I can see where some people can maybe like get a little irritated with that, you know,

1321
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,260
so, you know, again, I'm not saying this game is perfect.

1322
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,100
I'm not even I'm actually at this point, not sure it's going to be my favorite Final

1323
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,420
Fantasy game, but it's going to be in the top half.

1324
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,660
I could I, you know, I'm not through.

1325
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,820
I may be 40% of the way through the game.

1326
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,860
I already know this is better than 15.

1327
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:02,900
It's better than eight.

1328
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,780
Sorry, not sorry.

1329
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:05,060
It's better than two.

1330
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,900
It's better than like the bottom tier of Final Fantasy for me.

1331
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:14,580
It's better than it's certainly better than 14 original version, which is the worst Final

1332
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,220
Fantasy game.

1333
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,140
So 16 will absolutely be in the top half of the ranking.

1334
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:23,140
I'm just not sure exactly where yet for me.

1335
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:27,860
But I think, yeah, it's there's a lot of good stuff in there.

1336
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,460
But I'm curious to see where the story ends up going.

1337
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,620
I have I've seen that there is criticism about that the story apparently takes a turn at

1338
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:40,340
some point, and that the back half of the game was not as exciting as the front half

1339
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:40,740
of the game.

1340
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:41,780
I've heard that.

1341
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,820
But I'm going to draw my own conclusion on that.

1342
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:50,020
And because, you know, again, critics, I don't know, they don't always see it the same way

1343
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:50,500
I do.

1344
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,380
So we'll see.

1345
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:52,980
All right.

1346
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:55,060
That was my gaming week.

1347
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,300
Let's get into some gaming news.

1348
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,660
Quickly, though, I want to just do some quick housekeeping things.

1349
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:05,380
I want to give a shout out to the Dragon Con digital media track because earlier this week

1350
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:13,460
on the 20th, I was able to moderate a virtual LGBTQIA kind of panel discussion with some

1351
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:16,740
other content creators over there on the Dragon Con digital media track.

1352
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,620
That was really cool.

1353
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,460
It will be archived on YouTube soon.

1354
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,660
I don't think it's there yet, but I'll post the link on socials when that's up.

1355
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:26,900
But I just wanted to acknowledge and thank the folks that participated with that and

1356
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,820
the Dragon Con digital media track for doing that.

1357
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:36,820
Speaking of things to do in Atlanta, we will not be here the week of July 30th because

1358
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,820
I will be in Atlanta.

1359
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,780
I'm going to be at the Southern Fried Gaming Expo.

1360
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,460
I keep forgetting they changed their name a few years ago.

1361
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:49,540
But I will be there at that expo to help them celebrate their 10th anniversary.

1362
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,780
I'm very excited about it.

1363
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,380
I'm looking forward to being there.

1364
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,180
My picture is even on the website as somebody that's going.

1365
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,380
So that's really fun.

1366
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:58,500
I was very happy to see that.

1367
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,420
That's always a fun thing to do.

1368
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:04,100
So I look forward to joining you all in Atlanta twice this year.

1369
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,460
Once for SFGE and once for Dragon Con.

1370
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:10,660
But unfortunately, because of that traveling, there won't be a show that weekend.

1371
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,940
But that's like a month away.

1372
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:13,780
But just warning you all.

1373
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,380
Okay, let's get into some news.

1374
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:19,220
We'll probably, since the front half of the show is really long tonight, I'm probably

1375
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:21,780
going to accelerate our pacing on these stories a little bit.

1376
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:23,620
But I know there's some things we want to talk about still.

1377
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:24,260
So, Loki.

1378
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,220
Yeah, this is kind of a minor story.

1379
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:33,380
But the Game Pass prices are rising, apparently.

1380
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:38,740
So and including the Xbox Series X will also be increased worldwide.

1381
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:47,380
They're saying that the Game Pass is going to be going up from, I guess it's not a lot.

1382
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:48,820
It's like a buck or so.

1383
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:58,740
So from $10 to $11 worldwide and the Game Pass ultimate is going up from $15 to $17.

1384
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:03,940
And Microsoft, of course, says, you know, we've held our prices for consoles for many

1385
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,980
years and adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market.

1386
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:14,420
And these Game Pass price adjustments are not related to the Activision Blizzard deal

1387
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:17,540
and are intended to match our local market conditions.

1388
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:26,900
So they're saying that the Xbox Series X will remain $500 in the US, but it's going up to

1389
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:38,260
550 euro in Europe, $650 Canadian in Canada and $800 Australian in Australia.

1390
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,660
That's beginning August 1st.

1391
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:45,140
The Game Pass pricing is going into effect July 6th, so right around the corner.

1392
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:45,880
Hmm.

1393
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:51,940
So stock up on that year of Game Pass if you want to get in at the lower price or whatever.

1394
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:59,060
So I mean, we kind of knew the Game Pass price was going to go up eventually, but I just

1395
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,700
feel like I don't think Game Pass has had quite as strong of a year as previous years.

1396
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,380
I feel like a lot has been delisted from the service and they're adding new things, but

1397
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,860
it's not they're not really getting the big, big names.

1398
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,220
I think Starfield is good.

1399
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,540
That's you know, I know I'm very happy about that.

1400
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,380
And there'll be some other big names too, but I'll pay it.

1401
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,820
You know, it's still a great deal and so forth, but it's just one of those like, oh, it's

1402
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:22,340
just the timing of now.

1403
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:27,540
It's like, oh man, if only the Activision merger could finish and they could add all

1404
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:32,900
those games too, then I think it gives them really the bandwidth to really up, which they'll

1405
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,540
probably do again once that happens, quite honestly.

1406
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:36,660
But we'll see.

1407
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:40,100
We'll see what happens because that merger may not happen, but we'll get to that news

1408
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:40,600
later.

1409
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,400
All right, let's move on.

1410
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,200
Let's talk about one of those big Activision games, Diablo 4 out of Blizzard.

1411
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:54,520
People now that more and more people are finishing the main story, people are looking forward

1412
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,240
to the seasonal content.

1413
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:03,000
At some point in July, Diablo 4 seasons will begin and it's getting some pushback because

1414
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,320
the seasonal content is going to require players to complete a new character.

1415
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:09,800
It was talked about in a blog.

1416
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,440
Well, actually the blog post didn't talk about it.

1417
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:21,000
And then on Twitter, Rod Ferguson responded to somebody, I think it's, I'm going to just

1418
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:26,440
bite my tongue, but I just don't think this person usually contributes great articles.

1419
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:33,480
But anyway, saying that you will, yes, to take part in the seasonal quest line, mechanics,

1420
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,560
season journey and battle pass, you will need to create a new seasonal character playing

1421
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,640
campaign with seasonal character will also progress the season journey and battle pass.

1422
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,400
And people are not happy about it.

1423
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,400
Saying, as a new player, I don't see myself grinding like this again, if I have to start

1424
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,960
from scratch, I'm likely done maining Diablo.

1425
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,880
And I know a ton of people in the same boat.

1426
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:00,520
I'm sorry, why the fuck are you maining Diablo and going so far to say that if you didn't

1427
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,480
play Diablo two or three, where this was the exact same way it worked.

1428
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,320
This isn't news.

1429
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,120
Diablo has always done a level read.

1430
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,800
That's what seasons are all about.

1431
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:19,560
So I'm trying to like figure out like, why are people so weird about this when it's literally

1432
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,600
always been this way?

1433
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:27,400
And my only thought is because of that open world, really strong narrative structure of

1434
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,440
Diablo four, people are really worried about having to play it all over again.

1435
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:38,200
But they've already said, if you've played through the main story already, then when

1436
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:44,120
you do seasons, the map is unlocked, the Lilith statues are unlocked, you don't have to do

1437
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,680
that again.

1438
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:49,640
You just get that on your seasonal character and you can level however you want, which

1439
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:53,640
is how you leveled seasonal characters in three and then to remastered when they went

1440
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,280
back and did that.

1441
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,720
I really failed to see the problem here.

1442
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,120
And this is one of those headlines that again is being copy pasted like wildfire.

1443
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:08,840
And I don't understand the hysteria around it, but I'm pretty passionate about Diablo.

1444
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:15,560
It's no no secret around here, but I just it's it's silly.

1445
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,800
It's it's non non news to me.

1446
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:22,440
Pirate pound town and chat says, Yeah, this is just bandwagon gamers jumping into Diablo

1447
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,280
without knowing what Diablo is.

1448
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:24,840
That's what it's.

1449
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,400
So when somebody says I'm maining Diablo, you didn't put a lot of research into that

1450
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,120
before you did it.

1451
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,080
Now, did you?

1452
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,920
Because that's that sounds like a content creator saying that.

1453
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,680
And I'm like, do your homework before you declare that you are the world's definitive

1454
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,040
Diablo streamer.

1455
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:47,000
Like, obviously, maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit, but that's just that comment just

1456
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,120
comes from a place of, do you watch the show Tamar?

1457
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:55,720
Anyway, let's move on to other news.

1458
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:59,080
Dark Sakura, why don't you talk about a completely different game for us?

1459
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:06,600
Well, for anyone who is a fan of the original chocobo racing, there is now chocobo GP.

1460
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:14,680
And it's not going to nickel dime you for making any progress in there.

1461
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:27,000
And it has a new eShop store page that shows that it's like a rerelease on the switch

1462
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,960
for June 15th.

1463
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:32,280
It's going to have some neat little stuff in there.

1464
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:37,640
I'm sorry, I can make words happen, I promise.

1465
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:48,280
But basically, this is it really got bad reviews before, partly because of the paywalls

1466
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,320
and the grind and all of that.

1467
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,640
So now it's just going to be open.

1468
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,240
You also will get extra experience points.

1469
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:04,520
Well, sorry, they did do extra experience points as sort of an apology for that.

1470
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:14,680
But now this one is pretty much going to be, they're not going to do any big updates,

1471
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,640
no new characters.

1472
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:27,080
And yeah, so the rerelease is going for about 50 bucks.

1473
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:33,560
But this is, yeah, just you can transfer your previous save to the rerelease version.

1474
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,640
Just by buying it as an upgrade DLC for the light version.

1475
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,080
And then there you go.

1476
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:39,580
Yeah.

1477
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,600
And Mike Deft in chat saying this is what it should have been from the start.

1478
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,600
Dark Tetsuya is saying, I don't know, I got to say the ship has sailed on this one.

1479
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,800
They should have done it this way from the get go instead of charging 40 bucks for a

1480
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,080
free to play game.

1481
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,400
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm with all of you.

1482
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,160
Like this is definitely them going back and going like, whoops, this is how we should

1483
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,280
have done it from the beginning.

1484
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:03,480
And for all intents and purposes, it's probably too damn late.

1485
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:11,240
But it is interesting and rare to see a game company do that and try to be like, oops,

1486
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,000
let's relaunch this game the way the fans are saying we should have done it in the first

1487
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:15,500
place.

1488
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,560
It is rare to see that.

1489
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,400
I just don't know if I'm interested anymore.

1490
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:27,000
I have been interested since Chocobo racing.

1491
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,640
Yeah, yeah, I loved Chocobo racing.

1492
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,400
I didn't love Chocobo GP when I played it.

1493
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:39,720
And I think, admittedly, the whole micro transaction system was a part of what left the huge taste

1494
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,280
of my mouth.

1495
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:46,200
But honestly, do I care enough to go back and now play a full retail price for the game?

1496
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:47,340
Nah.

1497
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,880
Nah, I'm over it.

1498
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:51,720
Which is a bummer.

1499
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,280
I mean, there are people out there who are very happy about it.

1500
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,400
And I'm glad for them.

1501
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,240
Yeah, and my dad says I care.

1502
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:57,740
Yeah.

1503
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:00,300
Yeah, our opinion is not necessarily the definitive.

1504
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:05,420
People are burned by different fires.

1505
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,060
Yeah.

1506
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:12,220
And to be fair with what Dark Tetsuya says, maybe if it went on sale, I could go, yeah,

1507
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:16,460
like when that game comes down to $20, because inevitably it will come down to $20 and I'm

1508
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:18,300
willing to play that waiting game.

1509
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,660
I'll probably pick it up then.

1510
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:20,540
I'll pick it up for $20.

1511
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:27,660
But I'm not going to pay, you know, for, yeah, what it should have been the first time.

1512
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:32,300
So anyway, let's move on.

1513
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:33,360
Loki.

1514
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:34,700
Yeah.

1515
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:42,940
So there's more drama still with the whole Activision Blizzard acquisition and Sony PlayStation

1516
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,060
along with that as well.

1517
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:52,860
So now this is a little bit that came out about Jim Ryan and some of his private remarks

1518
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:56,060
regarding the acquisition deal that was going in place.

1519
01:22:56,060 --> 01:23:02,860
You may remember that Sony has made the argument that if that they don't believe that Microsoft

1520
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:12,140
will make good on their promise to keep Call of Duty multi platform in public, they say

1521
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:17,740
that at least Jim Ryan, however, in a private email that was shared, apparently with the

1522
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,020
court, said it's not an exclusivity play at all.

1523
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:27,420
It says they're thinking bigger than that, and they have the cash to make the moves like

1524
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:27,660
this.

1525
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:35,420
I spent a fair bit of time with Phil Spencer and Bobby Kojic over the past day, and I'm

1526
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:40,460
pretty sure we will continue to see Call of Duty on PlayStation for many years to come.

1527
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:48,780
So like they know that it's going to be, you know, available for the PlayStation.

1528
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:55,100
Microsoft is committed to three years already, and yet they're just making it out, obviously,

1529
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,180
because they don't want the deal to go through that.

1530
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:58,060
No, no, no.

1531
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:03,580
It's not going to be, you know, exclusive at all, even though in their minds it is.

1532
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,940
It's going to be available on their system, and that's not an issue.

1533
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,580
Also, this was crazy as well.

1534
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:20,940
Well, Jim Ryan also shared that if Activision were to be actively to be acquired by Microsoft,

1535
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:27,500
then Sony wouldn't share PlayStation six info with the developers of Call of Duty.

1536
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:33,660
Also, another argument that they've made before is that, well, you know, if Microsoft buys

1537
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:36,780
Activision Blizzard, they're just going to make a version of Call of Duty that's going

1538
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,180
to suck on PlayStation hardware.

1539
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:42,060
It's just going to play poorly and they're going to think, oh,

1540
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:45,580
it's the PlayStation hardware and not Call of Duty that's playing poorly.

1541
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:50,300
But now you're like saying that, oh, well, we're not going to give you information about our system.

1542
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,220
So what do you think is going to happen from that?

1543
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:56,940
You would get a product that is not going to perform as well as it could because you're

1544
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:01,820
withholding information because you're worried that they're going to have some sort of insider

1545
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:04,140
information that will affect, you know.

1546
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:08,620
The creation of the next Xbox console or something like that.

1547
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:12,620
It is just ridiculous that you would go that far.

1548
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:16,220
This court case is making Sony look real bad.

1549
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,980
It's making them look drunk with power.

1550
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,140
It's making them look like the one percent.

1551
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:25,740
And it's it's making Microsoft look humble, which is a weird thing to say.

1552
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:30,380
But as far as the games division goes, like you see Microsoft kind of admitting they know

1553
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,500
they're lagging behind in the race and they know, you know, some of these things.

1554
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,620
And yet they still, you know, they know they have to put games on certain consoles.

1555
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:41,180
And just the whole fact that Sony is like withholding and doing what they're withholding

1556
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,380
and then coming on the other hand and saying, oh, but we know we're getting a lesser than

1557
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:48,300
version, like it's almost like they're they're they're the ones trying to squelch the

1558
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:52,140
competition in the marketplace and it's coming out in court.

1559
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:55,100
And it really doesn't make Sony look good, to be honest.

1560
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:58,460
I don't think most gamers are going to give a shit because at the end of the day, Sony's

1561
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:01,420
got really great exclusives and a pretty damn good console.

1562
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,940
And that's what the gamers are.

1563
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:07,100
But it's when you look at the business side of things like you definitely look at this

1564
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,580
and you're like, Sony is not the good guy here.

1565
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,660
And I'm not before you all today.

1566
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:13,020
Oh, I'm a Microsoft fanboy.

1567
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,700
I'm a Microsoft apologist.

1568
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,740
I'm sorry.

1569
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:21,100
It's just like, again, I'm allowed to draw conclusions and, you know, make opinions based

1570
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:22,300
off these court documents.

1571
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:24,780
It does not make Sony look like nice people.

1572
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,620
It really doesn't.

1573
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:27,020
Yeah.

1574
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:29,180
And it's just like business isn't nice.

1575
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:30,940
I understand that.

1576
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:35,180
But it's just like one of those like, oh, it just makes a lot of those complaints that

1577
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,300
Sony's putting out there.

1578
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,860
Like, it's really exposing it for the bullshit that it is.

1579
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:40,300
Yeah.

1580
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,540
And honestly, I'm sorry.

1581
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:47,580
Look, I worry our legislators and I worry they're too dumb and they're going to fall

1582
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,380
for it.

1583
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:49,340
Of course they're dumb.

1584
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:52,380
Like, I mean, they don't understand how any of this stuff works.

1585
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:56,780
Although I would say that they're probably more willing to side with Microsoft on this

1586
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:00,860
because Microsoft being an American company and Sony being a Japanese company.

1587
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:05,660
Unfortunately for them, it's just, you know, USA, USA, USA.

1588
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,900
And it doesn't matter what the situation is.

1589
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,660
I honestly don't think that they understand fully what's going on here.

1590
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:16,220
And it's also very hypocritical of Sony, too, because Sony does the exact same things when

1591
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:22,380
it comes to given the opportunity, they will absolutely pay for exclusivity on their console.

1592
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,380
They have fucking look at 16.

1593
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:30,300
That's not to say that Sony or Microsoft hasn't done the same thing in the past with like

1594
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:32,060
third party stuff as well.

1595
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:35,020
But you may get like a year of exclusivity or something like that.

1596
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:38,220
But like, but yeah, they do this.

1597
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:42,620
And to pretend like we don't do this, this is ridiculous.

1598
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,060
We would never do that.

1599
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:44,860
Like, come on.

1600
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,900
Like, we don't trust you at all to do this.

1601
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:53,100
And like for me, like, I don't even care anymore about console wars because I'm just going

1602
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,500
for PC, PC, I win out everything.

1603
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:58,140
I can play all the different systems on PC if I want to.

1604
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,060
I mean, emulating Switch, of course.

1605
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:05,900
But like I it's it doesn't really make sense to me to like dive into a console anymore

1606
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:07,500
because I just don't play my consoles.

1607
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,500
Like I don't play my PlayStation four.

1608
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,980
I haven't played that in like over a year.

1609
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:16,300
And my Xbox Series X is in a box under my desk right now.

1610
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:19,580
Like it is not being used at all.

1611
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,460
Like I just I don't know.

1612
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:25,900
I bought a Series X and I used it hard for like two years.

1613
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:31,420
But then when I upgraded my PC, my Series X is now the downstairs media device so that

1614
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:35,100
Alan can watch 4K stuff through the Series X.

1615
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:37,180
Like that's our PS3 for that.

1616
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,100
Yeah, it's seriously like it made me reconsider.

1617
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,740
That's why I was like, well, do I really want a PlayStation five?

1618
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,380
Probably not, because like I just won't use it.

1619
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:49,500
Like I won't get the money out of it like that.

1620
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:53,260
It's just not worth it, especially for PlayStation VR, too.

1621
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:57,340
Like that's just a money pit right there.

1622
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:02,620
But yeah, I just we don't like any of these corporate companies nowadays.

1623
01:29:02,620 --> 01:29:06,300
You just we've gotten burned so many times by corporations.

1624
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:09,500
I just don't trust Sony in this sense.

1625
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,980
I don't trust Microsoft either, like 100 percent.

1626
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:15,580
But at least they've been seeming to be more on the side of like the consumer.

1627
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:19,900
Recently, that could all change one day, sure.

1628
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:22,540
But like right now, they seem to be on the consumer side,

1629
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,300
at least Game Pass is a great deal.

1630
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,580
So well, it's a lot of that is in the leader.

1631
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:28,540
A lot of it is in the leader.

1632
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:29,420
Yeah, for sure.

1633
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,300
Gaming on my Mac.

1634
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,140
I don't trust anybody.

1635
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:37,180
Well, and you don't have as many games to play either.

1636
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:39,820
Yeah, actually, I pretty much can play just about anything.

1637
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,740
So some of those games that you've talked about streaming in the past.

1638
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:48,380
Well, come the next operating system, I won't have that problem at all.

1639
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,220
Ask Whoopi Goldberg how Diablo 4 is going.

1640
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:53,580
Come the next operating system, I won't have that problem at all.

1641
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,460
I heard about that.

1642
01:29:56,060 --> 01:29:57,580
Some other comments in chat.

1643
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:02,060
Dartusia says, I don't know, we're using our series S lately for D4

1644
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:05,100
when the network wants to work and Street Fighter 6 mostly.

1645
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:10,460
And honestly, Dartusia, if I hadn't upgraded my PC, I'd probably be in the same boat.

1646
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,780
I'd be using a console to play those games as well.

1647
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:14,540
Absolutely.

1648
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,740
But yeah.

1649
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:19,420
Also, you can play Diablo 4 on a Mac.

1650
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,460
GeForce Now has it.

1651
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:22,860
Oh, I didn't know GeForce Now has it.

1652
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:23,180
That's cool.

1653
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:25,820
Well, somebody needs to send that to Whoopi Goldberg.

1654
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:33,580
So yeah, pretty much anything that's worth having is either coming out natively or is on a stream

1655
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:40,140
service and like everyone knows the next, you know, as already has come out for the next OS

1656
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:47,900
that the line like deal is going to basically make Maxfully Gaming compatible.

1657
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:53,260
Well, and, you know, you bring up a good point about the cloud gaming in general.

1658
01:30:53,260 --> 01:30:58,700
I mean, that's just that's enabling gaming on many, many more devices,

1659
01:30:58,700 --> 01:30:59,980
Max and otherwise.

1660
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:04,860
And, you know, laptops and, you know, phones, I guess, and tablets and things like that.

1661
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,260
That's where, too, that's a lot, you know, cloud gaming.

1662
01:31:07,260 --> 01:31:10,220
We kind of look at how much of the future is really going to be in cloud gaming.

1663
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:15,980
Again, I think we're just stable 5G over connections away from cloud gaming really taking

1664
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:16,540
over.

1665
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:20,380
And I think and so it's interesting to kind of go back to a lot of where this conversation

1666
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,900
started about console wars.

1667
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:28,460
I think that's the big, ironically, cloud looming in the sky is once 5G is available

1668
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:28,940
anywhere.

1669
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:32,540
I don't think you're going to need consoles anymore in the traditional sense.

1670
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,420
So they're still going to try.

1671
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:39,740
Of course, they're going to try really slow to abandon technology, but it's going to be

1672
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:45,420
interesting to see how the consoles might evolve to make that case for what cloud gaming

1673
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:46,220
can't bring you.

1674
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:48,220
It'll be interesting to see what they do.

1675
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:50,780
Excuse me.

1676
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:56,140
Well, that court case has really been fascinating to see play out, and we're still going to

1677
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:57,340
get more gems out of that.

1678
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:58,060
That's for sure.

1679
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,540
Loki, I'm sorry, I might have missed it.

1680
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:02,860
You talk about the PlayStation six, that part of things.

1681
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:04,380
Yes.

1682
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:05,020
Okay, sorry.

1683
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:12,780
Then let's talk about a different six in a series that I don't know if this game is ever

1684
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:13,100
coming.

1685
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:16,140
It feels like Elder Scrolls six.

1686
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:21,260
Apparently, this was something that came out of this recent trial as well, or whatever

1687
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:26,060
the hearings, whatever you want to call it that's going on right now is that even though

1688
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:34,460
the Elder Scrolls six was announced five years ago at the 2018 E3 Expo, it was said

1689
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,620
by Phil Spencer, this game is still five days or five days away.

1690
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:45,980
I wish five plus years away, saying under oath, quote, I think we've been a little unclear

1691
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:50,060
on what platforms that will launch on given how far out the game is.

1692
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,900
It's difficult for us right now to nail down exactly what platforms the games will launch

1693
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:54,460
on.

1694
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:59,500
As I said with Elder Scrolls six, it's so far out, it's hard to understand what the

1695
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,580
platforms will even be at this point.

1696
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:05,580
It's the same team that's finishing Starfield, which comes out in September.

1697
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:09,180
So we're talking about being likely five plus years away.

1698
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:13,900
So when he's talking about platform, he's not talking about Sony versus Microsoft.

1699
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:17,340
He's talking about would it be PS five or PS six?

1700
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:23,500
Because they might be needing to prep this game for a more advanced console and the Xbox

1701
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:28,700
equivalent of that, obviously, like whether it's series Y or whatever it is.

1702
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:34,940
Phoenix 7726 says, Rob, at this rate, Elder Scrolls is going to beat Kingdom Hearts for

1703
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,860
longest gap between sequels.

1704
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:44,380
This just also goes to show how freaking long it is between big budget games.

1705
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:49,820
I mean, you know, earlier in the show, I was talking a lot about Final Fantasy 16.

1706
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:53,420
Think about how long it's been since Final Fantasy 15.

1707
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:57,100
It's been seven years since Final Fantasy 15.

1708
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:58,380
Wow.

1709
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:07,980
Seven years is more time than what passed between Final Fantasy four, five, six, seven

1710
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,580
and eight.

1711
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:13,260
No, was 491 or 92?

1712
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,540
Because eight was 99.

1713
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,420
So 92 would have been seven years ago.

1714
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:26,780
But at least five, six, seven and eight were all done within the same period that it's

1715
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:29,100
taken 15 to 16.

1716
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,540
So that's kind of food for thought as well.

1717
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:36,140
That just speaks to the long development cycle of a lot of these games now, for sure.

1718
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:38,940
So, you know, I'm not totally surprised to hear this now.

1719
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:42,220
I'm kind of wondering, well, why did they announce this way back as they did?

1720
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:48,140
But, you know, this was also before the Microsoft purchase, and maybe they had a different plan

1721
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:48,700
to get there.

1722
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:52,940
I'm not saying Microsoft's delayed it, but maybe Microsoft's going to force it to be

1723
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:56,460
a more quality product when it comes out being less bugs.

1724
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:03,180
Starfield is going to be very telling for if Bethesda has maybe changed some of their

1725
01:35:04,060 --> 01:35:09,660
things that they get razzed for a lot in the QA department or lack of addressing QA department,

1726
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:13,260
I should say, since Microsoft took over.

1727
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:17,100
Because if Starfield is still a buggy mess, people are going to be like, why the fuck

1728
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,940
did they delay this as much as they did?

1729
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:24,140
But if it's really, really polished, people are going to be like, wow, a Bethesda game

1730
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:25,180
that actually, yeah.

1731
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:31,340
So Phoenix 7726 says, to be fair, Rob, those games were not nearly as complicated and took

1732
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:32,700
much less time to develop.

1733
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:35,420
And at this point, these times are just going to keep going up.

1734
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:36,300
Oh, exactly that.

1735
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,700
I actually am making that same point.

1736
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:44,060
Yeah, it wasn't as hard to do the sprite art in those days, and even the PlayStation 1

1737
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:48,540
style art from seven and eight, and what goes into those games, then what games require

1738
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:49,040
today.

1739
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:53,340
So there's going to be a long wait between 16 and 17.

1740
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:57,580
But I guarantee 17 is already under development.

1741
01:35:57,580 --> 01:36:02,060
I think the question is, is it another MMO or not?

1742
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:05,100
Because 11 was an MMO, 14 was an MMO.

1743
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:09,020
So if they follow the pattern, 17 would be an MMO.

1744
01:36:10,060 --> 01:36:13,180
I'm not sure they want to do an MMO now.

1745
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:18,780
Again, I feel like 14 is still riding a wave that they could have another single player

1746
01:36:18,780 --> 01:36:20,140
game in a 17.

1747
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:25,260
But it's so hard to say, you know, again, Square Enix maybe doesn't want to number their

1748
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,780
Final Fantasy games anymore.

1749
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:27,280
Who knows?

1750
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:33,260
So yeah, and I agree Phoenix 14 is still going too strong.

1751
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,420
No need to kill it and pull an Overwatch one.

1752
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:38,460
Well, to be fair, 11 is still going.

1753
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:42,860
I don't know if I would say strong, but it has people that love it very much and are

1754
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:43,820
still showing up to play.

1755
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:49,420
So even 11, you know, just a new MMO coming out doesn't negate the other necessarily.

1756
01:36:49,420 --> 01:36:55,260
But yeah, anyway, let's move on to whenever Elder Scrolls 6 finally comes out.

1757
01:36:55,260 --> 01:36:56,780
Many people I'm sure will stream it.

1758
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,140
And so we always watch what's going on in streaming communities.

1759
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:00,860
Right, Dark Sakura?

1760
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:02,700
That we do.

1761
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:05,260
And it's not the best news.

1762
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:10,220
Well, I mean, if you're, you know, everybody except partners.

1763
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:22,540
So there is this hype chat thing coming where basically you can pay to have your chat highlighted,

1764
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:27,500
like pinned for a bit, you know, to guarantee that it'll be seen.

1765
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:31,660
And you're basically buying your chat message.

1766
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,180
This is not a new idea.

1767
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,500
This has been happening on YouTube already.

1768
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,100
I was gonna say, this sounds like super chats.

1769
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:38,240
Yeah.

1770
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,220
They're calling it hype chat.

1771
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:44,700
So you can pay anything between $1 to $500.

1772
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:49,740
You can set a minimum of up to $100.

1773
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:55,420
And so depending on how much you pay, depends on how long it stays up as well as character

1774
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,780
length in the visual design.

1775
01:37:56,780 --> 01:38:09,900
And this also gives the streamer a share of the revenue from the hype chat.

1776
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,020
I don't know what that share is.

1777
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:18,060
But I don't know what they're thinking.

1778
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,700
They're not making this a friendly environment.

1779
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:25,180
And then also though, and now this is slightly okay.

1780
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:34,540
They're working on a new range of labels and tags to better identify the kind of mature

1781
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,860
content that's being displayed.

1782
01:38:37,420 --> 01:38:40,780
So I mean, like for right now, it just had mature content and it could be anything.

1783
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:46,700
So the new levels are going to be mature rated games, sexual themes, drugs intoxication,

1784
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,060
or excessive tobacco use.

1785
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:49,900
Why is that?

1786
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:50,620
Whatever.

1787
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:56,940
Anyway, violent or graphic depictions, significant profanity or vulgarity and gambling.

1788
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:08,700
These are basically, they're not going to get people away with breaking the rules, but

1789
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:15,740
these are out there just as general warnings for anyone who might peek in.

1790
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:20,620
If the game has that kind of content in it, not necessarily the streamer.

1791
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:29,660
So there's a lot of, what's the word I'm thinking of?

1792
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:34,780
A lot of false reporting that goes on too, like retaliatory.

1793
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:41,340
That I think they need to look a bit more at the current system of reporting and action

1794
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,740
rather than adding more labels.

1795
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:56,140
So anyway, I'm not going to kick because it's very abusive toward anyone who's basically

1796
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:59,180
not, you know, straight sister white.

1797
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:08,940
But I don't know, I won't say anything else about it.

1798
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,060
I have feelings, that's all.

1799
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:10,940
I have feelings.

1800
01:40:10,940 --> 01:40:15,660
No, so I don't think kick is, I've said this on the show previously.

1801
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:21,180
I think last week, until there's an adult that's clearly in charge of kick, and it looks

1802
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,300
like an adult is running it.

1803
01:40:23,180 --> 01:40:25,500
I'm not really interested right now.

1804
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:31,660
It just seems a little bit like it feels like the ball pit at Dashcon right now.

1805
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:33,260
And that's not a place I need to be.

1806
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:35,820
Somebody peed in that thing.

1807
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:36,940
You know it.

1808
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:41,100
The ball pit at Twitch was better.

1809
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,860
It had a mac and cheese in it.

1810
01:40:42,860 --> 01:40:44,140
Yeah, that is true.

1811
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:48,060
Let's see other stuff in chat.

1812
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:56,140
Mike Deft by Black Wolf, a few people pointing out that that split on the hype chats is 70-30

1813
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:58,380
plus a 5% fee.

1814
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:04,460
It just seems like a lot of, you know, like, why do I need to hype that?

1815
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:05,500
Yeah, it's a money grab.

1816
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:07,420
I'm not going to encourage people to buy that.

1817
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:09,900
I mean, if at the end of the day, it's your money.

1818
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,580
We're not partners anyway.

1819
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:12,300
Oh yeah, that's right.

1820
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:13,900
It's only partners, not affiliates.

1821
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:14,620
That's right.

1822
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:16,300
So yeah, it is.

1823
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:17,660
It is a little silly in my opinion.

1824
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,900
No one I know that's a partner would do that other than a joke.

1825
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,400
Yeah.

1826
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:28,540
Bobby in chat says the content warnings are fine for me on Twitch.

1827
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,860
It helps advertisers target ads better.

1828
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:35,020
The stuff about excessive drinking and smoking is about excessive drinking and smoking on

1829
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:35,660
stream.

1830
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:38,060
Taking a sip of beer doesn't need the content warning.

1831
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:39,500
Doing a drunk show would.

1832
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:43,100
And I'm assuming that's similar to there's a difference.

1833
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:45,740
I wasn't talking about the drinking aspect of it.

1834
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:49,820
Yeah, but I'm going to assume there's also a difference between somebody who does this

1835
01:41:50,460 --> 01:41:54,860
and has a little whiff of a pen once in a, in a, in a great while.

1836
01:41:54,860 --> 01:42:00,540
And somebody who's like fully got their bong out, taking hits between answering Q and A.

1837
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:03,980
Like they just, they need to define it clearly.

1838
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:04,620
Yes.

1839
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,020
Yes.

1840
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:06,140
Leaving it so subjective.

1841
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:06,780
Exactly.

1842
01:42:06,780 --> 01:42:07,260
Exactly.

1843
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,580
So are they saying that Doug Benson isn't welcome on Twitch?

1844
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:13,180
Because they specifically said tobacco.

1845
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:15,820
And I'm sorry, I know chain smokers.

1846
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:16,540
Yeah.

1847
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,540
Who will chain smoke during their stream?

1848
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:19,040
Yeah.

1849
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:21,900
So what's, what's excessive?

1850
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:23,180
What's the definition of it?

1851
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:26,700
Are they smoking like five packs in an hour or what?

1852
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:30,860
I mean, that's, and it's a elaboration, but still.

1853
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:35,740
Oh, apparently MJ always needs the content warning, even if it's just a small hit.

1854
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:36,300
Interesting.

1855
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:43,980
Cause a lot of DVD streamers I watch partake in between or even have channel rewards to partake.

1856
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:47,820
So that's very, I mean, granted, if they're streaming DVD, it's already

1857
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:51,500
a restricted channel because they're playing an M rated game.

1858
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,540
So that's interesting.

1859
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:59,580
But yeah, I think there's too much subjectiveness as stark Sakura put it.

1860
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:02,620
I think there's, they're going to need to clearly define those lanes.

1861
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:06,380
And for the love of God, get your affiliates and

1862
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:11,500
partners to the table to help you in defining those lanes.

1863
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:14,540
Oh, you know, they're not going to, I mean, now here's the thing.

1864
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,780
I'm, I'm a member of Twitch RPG.

1865
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:23,820
And I haven't really seen a whole lot being done with that.

1866
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:26,940
You know, I do my surveys when I get them.

1867
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:29,740
Oh, we'll, we'll give you a hundred bits to do this survey.

1868
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:36,860
But there's, they're not like super in depth, you know, not,

1869
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:41,580
not a really big survey or a deep dive into things that people might want to see.

1870
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:44,780
And they're missing an opportunity with that.

1871
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:45,920
Yeah.

1872
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:52,540
Bobby is copy pasting some stuff from the fact that apparently does try to draw the

1873
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:57,260
lanes a little more on what exactly alcohol use is, you know, smoking a cigarette and

1874
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:01,340
all of that is, but even then they say, okay, for alcohol use, sipping on a drink

1875
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:05,820
while streaming wouldn't require a label, but apparently appearing visibly intoxicated to

1876
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:09,980
the point you are slurring your speech or making being drunk the focus of your stream.

1877
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:12,540
For example, doing a drunk history would require a label.

1878
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:15,500
I still say there's a lot of interpretation in there.

1879
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,060
I get it.

1880
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:19,580
It does sound like one extreme or the other, but what if it's not one of the extremes?

1881
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:23,180
Who's to say what visibly intoxicated is?

1882
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:28,620
And again, there's been plenty of false reports for other issues.

1883
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:29,120
Yeah.

1884
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:35,420
You know that I, I, they're going to need to step up their moderation staff.

1885
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:39,980
And then of course, make sure their moderation staff is trustworthy.

1886
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:40,940
Yeah, for sure.

1887
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:43,500
I mean, cause we we've heard that incident.

1888
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:44,860
All right.

1889
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:45,980
Let's move on to our next story.

1890
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,420
I've take a quick, quick AFK.

1891
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:49,420
I'm sorry, but, uh, Loki, you want to take the next story?

1892
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:51,020
Yeah.

1893
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:57,340
This is not really surprising at all, but considering the whole, uh, situation with

1894
01:44:57,340 --> 01:45:01,580
E3 and the sudden cancellation in, uh, 2023.

1895
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:08,940
Well, now it's coming out that according to information from the Los Angeles city tourism

1896
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:15,180
board of commissioners held its regularly scheduled meeting and announced updates on

1897
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:22,220
tourism and whatnot, and basically said that it didn't sound like that E3 was happening

1898
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:26,060
in 23 or 2024 and 2025.

1899
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:36,300
Um, and apparently, uh, the ESA has come out to say, ESA is currently in conversations

1900
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:41,980
with ESA members and other stakeholders about E3 2024 and beyond, and no final decisions

1901
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:43,900
about the events have been made at this time.

1902
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:47,980
That doesn't say that they, that's not a yes that we're doing it next year.

1903
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:57,340
So, um, I would assume that, you know, Los Angeles being the host city of E3 would be

1904
01:45:57,340 --> 01:45:59,180
aware whether they're doing it or not.

1905
01:45:59,900 --> 01:46:05,340
Um, as of right now, I wouldn't be surprised if it's canceled going forward.

1906
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:10,300
I mean, honestly, I mean, there is no excuse this year aside from everybody dropping out,

1907
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:14,860
I guess, I guess that's excuse enough, but I don't see everybody just all of a sudden

1908
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:16,220
jumping on next year.

1909
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:18,460
I don't think anything's going to change.

1910
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,580
So I think they're done.

1911
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:25,100
Um, Bobby and point, uh, Bobby and chat says this only means they're not doing E3 in LA.

1912
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:26,460
It could be done elsewhere.

1913
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:27,100
That's true.

1914
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:28,460
It could be done elsewhere.

1915
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,420
Go back to Vegas.

1916
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:30,140
Yeah.

1917
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:31,900
Why are we giving the ESA this much credit?

1918
01:46:33,180 --> 01:46:35,180
I don't E3 is done.

1919
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:35,900
E3 has done.

1920
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:36,780
E3 has been done.

1921
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:38,460
It's here now.

1922
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:45,180
Now the question is, how does it evolve with this whole partnership for the E3, as you

1923
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:48,780
used to know it, as you used to attend is done is done.

1924
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:50,380
It's been done for some time.

1925
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:56,140
However, that name, you know, if we know, read pop, getting the rights to the name and

1926
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:58,780
all this stuff, we know read pop also runs packs.

1927
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:05,980
I think there's a very clear way that the E3 kind of what everybody thinks E3 is and

1928
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:09,180
what packs really is, is kind of merged together.

1929
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:15,500
And I think what we used to know is E3 ends up effectively becoming packs Southwest or

1930
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:15,740
something.

1931
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:16,380
No, it's not packs.

1932
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,540
Southwest used to be like Texas, right?

1933
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:22,700
I don't know, packs Pacific or something, which is packs prime, but I feel like there's

1934
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:26,220
going to be either a Vegas or an LA type of packs.

1935
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:31,180
And that's, you know, what essentially, you know, that time of year in E3 ends up turning

1936
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:34,380
into, uh, where maybe even as either.

1937
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:39,980
And I think I said this way back then, as I said, the first year it will be packs presents

1938
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:40,940
E3.

1939
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:43,900
And then after that year it will be E3 featuring packs.

1940
01:47:45,980 --> 01:47:51,740
And that's, that's where, and then it will be E3 in Boston, E3, you know, yes, ironically

1941
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:53,980
E for all at the end of the day.

1942
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:54,460
Yeah.

1943
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:57,180
So that's where I think it goes.

1944
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:59,260
And it's because of the read pop connection.

1945
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:03,580
That's why I'm drawing that line because effectively read pop will own packs.

1946
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:06,300
And then they're also going to have the rights to the E3.

1947
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:12,540
So I think they inject that E3 stuff into packs, but it ends up being that what, what

1948
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:18,140
this is basically what the fuck is packs had to do with penny arcade for a long time now.

1949
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:21,180
So at some point it will just be E3.

1950
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:25,420
And they already have like each featuring the packs board game lounge.

1951
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,020
It's just like, it's, it's not really adding anything.

1952
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:31,020
It's not like they're going to have word gaming content.

1953
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,340
It'd be just basically what it was before.

1954
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:38,940
By doing that, here's the thing, the ESA still wants to get membership dues.

1955
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:42,780
That's why they're not going to know that I am being 100% legit.

1956
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:50,220
So E3 is going to say, Oh, this is going to make it more attractive for the gaming companies

1957
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:51,100
in that region.

1958
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:56,300
And that's why I think there will be an LA San Diego or Vegas version of packs at some

1959
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:00,860
point because of the game companies in that area, I guess you could do San Francisco as

1960
01:49:00,860 --> 01:49:01,580
well.

1961
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:05,180
So somewhere, you know, Silicon Valley, San Jose even.

1962
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:09,740
So somewhere I that's just why I see like a packs California or Vegas type of thing

1963
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:15,100
happening because now that the ESA will have a stake in this, essentially the ESA will

1964
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:15,580
have a stake.

1965
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:22,460
And they'll be like, Oh, well, by you being in the ESA, we want you to exhibit at E3 what

1966
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:27,020
used to be packs and try to draw more big name.

1967
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:33,340
When packs has always been about indie, it was some big name sometimes, but try to use

1968
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:36,300
that power to pull in more big boosts at your packs.

1969
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:39,740
They can try.

1970
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,780
Yeah, we'll see.

1971
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:44,060
We'll see what happens.

1972
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:48,940
So Pirate Pound Town in chat says Santa Clara, better venues.

1973
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,620
I don't know if there's anything there that's big.

1974
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:53,820
And honestly, even though I say San Jose, I don't think there's anything big enough.

1975
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:56,940
Even the San Jose is probably not big enough for something.

1976
01:49:56,940 --> 01:50:01,020
Well, if it holds Fanime, it can probably hold E3, but it just depends.

1977
01:50:01,020 --> 01:50:02,620
It depends how big they want to go.

1978
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:09,180
I just I think Vegas is the obvious cheap convention city, but San Diego is pretty good

1979
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:09,420
too.

1980
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:11,100
It's just San Diego can be kind of expensive.

1981
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:16,380
So I can see them, you know, putting it somewhere.

1982
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:26,140
Okay, moving on, let's get to our next story, which has to do with Quake 2.

1983
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:30,700
Not one, not three, you know, the good ones, but Quake 2.

1984
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:39,420
Apparently, a game rating and administration committee in Korea has rated Quake 2 remastered.

1985
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:41,420
Well, this hasn't been announced yet.

1986
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:46,460
This is also, by the way, how Quake remastered was announced before it was actually announced

1987
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:47,420
in 2021.

1988
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:53,260
Just an interesting aside, QuakeCon is coming up in August in Texas.

1989
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:59,020
So if there's any legitimacy to this, which there probably is, then you're going to hear

1990
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:02,300
about it at QuakeCon in August, which you probably will.

1991
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:05,660
So look forward to a Quake 2 remastered.

1992
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:06,060
You know what?

1993
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,220
It is a good chance for that game to get a second chance.

1994
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:11,660
I know I kind of, you know, make fun of it a little bit, but it just didn't play quite

1995
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:14,620
the same as the first, you know, and it did a different thing.

1996
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:17,420
But maybe going back and remastering it, you kind of revisit some of that.

1997
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:19,500
And, you know, it's been a long time.

1998
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:20,860
You take another look at it.

1999
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:27,740
All right, speaking of classics, I think it's time for an old favorite segment here on our

2000
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:28,460
program.

2001
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:29,500
So let's roll the bumper.

2002
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:45,500
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive into the vault and pull

2003
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,820
out a classic and tell you about it.

2004
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:50,460
It's time for the classic game of the week.

2005
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:54,700
And what did you pick for us tonight, DarkSagra?

2006
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:58,540
I picked a game called Last Resort.

2007
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:03,100
It is a horizontal shooter by SNK.

2008
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:06,220
The arcade release was out in 1992.

2009
01:52:07,100 --> 01:52:13,980
Of course, it got a port for the home Neo Geo and Neo Geo CD systems and several other

2010
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:16,700
rereleases, and I'll be getting into that momentarily.

2011
01:52:17,980 --> 01:52:24,620
The point that I want to bring up just to start off with has to do with the development

2012
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:32,780
and the reason why some things may look kind of familiar, like as in R-type like, is because

2013
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:36,700
Last Resort was developed by former IRM staff members.

2014
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:41,500
And IRM did, you guessed it, R-type.

2015
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:49,260
Anyway, so you basically have to blast through five different stages twice and destroy the

2016
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:55,100
end boss by aiming at their weak points.

2017
01:52:55,740 --> 01:53:06,700
So you have a cyber jet and then a robot drone that you can use as a shield and also as an

2018
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:12,060
additional weapon with multi-fire and concussion launch capabilities.

2019
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:19,820
The drone can be toggled to be in front or behind, and behind it can be a cyber jet that

2020
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:26,380
can be upgraded with three types of firepower and faster jet speed by getting different

2021
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,020
power-ups.

2022
01:53:28,060 --> 01:53:31,020
It's basically the R-9 from R-type.

2023
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,220
I'm just going to say that right now.

2024
01:53:33,180 --> 01:53:42,540
So basically, the plot of it is that this computer virus has infected the primary computer

2025
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:50,860
that runs the first space station, and so it's basically brought up its automated defensive.

2026
01:53:51,900 --> 01:53:59,580
And so now the computer is attacking Earth and you have to stop the computer by fighting

2027
01:54:00,460 --> 01:54:02,300
its drones and whatnot.

2028
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:11,260
Anyway, it got really positive reviews from seven reviewers and Gamists in 1992.

2029
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:21,500
Game Machine listed the game on their May 15, 1992, as the 13th most popular arcade

2030
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,380
software at the time.

2031
01:54:23,180 --> 01:54:27,900
Replay also put it up pretty highly, very positive reviews overall.

2032
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:31,420
And yes, lots of people comparing it to R-type.

2033
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:39,500
And also, there have been visual comparisons to Akira, the film from 1988.

2034
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:44,860
And I can definitely see it in some of the aspects.

2035
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:53,180
It just really had some great qualities to it.

2036
01:54:53,260 --> 01:55:06,060
However, the AES conversion was pretty much turned down because of some slowdown and

2037
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:13,100
shorter length, because, I mean, of course, the hardware was meant to handle the same

2038
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:14,380
thing the arcades could.

2039
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:21,020
But the graphics, the music two-player mode were all considered really great, but the

2040
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:26,300
lack of also the additional stage and, of course, the slowdown still got further scores

2041
01:55:27,340 --> 01:55:27,740
lower.

2042
01:55:30,220 --> 01:55:36,060
One thing that was praised was the power-up system was a mixture of R-type and forgotten

2043
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:36,540
worlds.

2044
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:42,380
However, again, slowdown still, still, still.

2045
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:49,340
And it was even being compared to the shooters on the Super Nintendo as far as the console

2046
01:55:49,340 --> 01:55:49,900
slowdown.

2047
01:55:55,020 --> 01:56:01,980
But I mean, overall, it was considered just a really, really visually stunning and audio

2048
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:03,580
stunning game in the arcade version.

2049
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:06,140
What is still popular.

2050
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:11,900
We're also, I think there's, I've seen recent re-releases come out for it.

2051
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:20,060
But as far as other versions, of course, we had the Neo Geo arcade, the MVS.

2052
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:23,180
We've had the Neo Geo AES, which is the home one.

2053
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:25,180
We've had the Neo Geo CD.

2054
01:56:26,380 --> 01:56:31,900
We've had SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 for PS2, PS Portable, and Wii.

2055
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:37,260
And then ACA Neo Geo for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2056
01:56:37,260 --> 01:56:46,060
I also think that I got a thing through my Prime gaming account that it was one of the

2057
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:48,060
SNK games they were giving out for free.

2058
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:56,380
So, but yeah, I mean, it's really straightforward.

2059
01:56:56,380 --> 01:57:04,060
But I just thought that its notability was because of the way that it really portrayed

2060
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:14,700
the sense of its lore through the environment and graphics, as well as having the benefit

2061
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:17,580
of being by former Irem programmers.

2062
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:20,780
And I think that's really where the R-Type influence comes in.

2063
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:26,700
A little bit also like how it also did in Blazing Star and Polestar.

2064
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:29,660
Another two of my favorite SNK shooters.

2065
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:34,460
But yeah, it's Last Resort.

2066
01:57:35,660 --> 01:57:36,460
All right.

2067
01:57:36,460 --> 01:57:37,020
There it is.

2068
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:40,060
Your classic game of the week, Last Resort.

2069
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:45,420
I feel like I've put a quarter or two in this machine before, but I honestly had a hard

2070
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:46,460
time recalling it.

2071
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:50,940
But yeah, I definitely see a lot of what you're talking about.

2072
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:54,540
A lot of the R-Type kind of similarities and things of that sort.

2073
01:57:55,420 --> 01:58:00,220
I think they had it for a hot minute back in the day at Crestview Lanes.

2074
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,180
Oh God.

2075
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:04,380
That takes me back.

2076
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:11,580
But I know for a fact that it was, I think what took it over, because I knew they had

2077
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:14,300
this for a long time, was Blazing Star.

2078
01:58:15,980 --> 01:58:18,940
Which I love Last Resort.

2079
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:20,700
I think Blazing Star was more fun.

2080
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:26,140
But I mean, I also would rather play R-Type.

2081
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:34,460
So it just had that distinction of being like a marriage of titles.

2082
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:39,420
But it's no less a good game.

2083
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:45,340
And I think that if you've got Prime or you have other services that will allow you to

2084
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,260
check out this game, you should totally do it.

2085
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:49,820
It's a good one.

2086
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:56,700
Yeah, obviously these Neo Geo games show up a lot on the Prime, and it's a good chance

2087
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:58,540
to check them all out and take a walk down memory lane.

2088
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:05,660
All right, well, let's talk quickly about some other headlines going on in the gaming

2089
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:08,620
industry this week and some rapid fire news.

2090
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:09,120
Loki.

2091
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:10,640
Yep.

2092
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:16,940
So I mean, with the movie right around the corner, the brand new Barbie movie, there

2093
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:24,780
was a small announcement that the 1956 Chevrolet Barbie movie Corvette EV is going to be in

2094
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:26,140
Forza Horizon five.

2095
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:27,820
I love this for the record.

2096
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:35,660
And they also have the 2022 GMC Barbie movie Hummer EV pickup as well that you can drive

2097
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:36,160
around.

2098
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:38,300
That's silly.

2099
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:39,920
Awesome.

2100
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:40,800
That's great.

2101
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:43,980
And then let's see.

2102
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:51,020
So Lies of P and Wong Lo have a partnership going on.

2103
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:58,060
So I guess that's Wong Lo Fallen Destiny is the Tecmo or Koei, was it Tecmo Koei?

2104
01:59:58,060 --> 01:59:59,020
Koei Tecmo now?

2105
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:01,360
Yeah.

2106
02:00:02,220 --> 02:00:05,020
So it's Koei Tecmo.

2107
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,940
Yeah, it used to be Tecmo Koei back in the day.

2108
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:17,100
Anyways, they're going to do a little bit of a crossover with during September, I guess.

2109
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:22,460
And they haven't announced the details yet of what's going to be involved with that crossover,

2110
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:24,700
but it is something that is coming.

2111
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:27,420
So souls like combined.

2112
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:30,540
All right.

2113
02:00:30,540 --> 02:00:32,620
I know a lot of people looking forward to that lies of P game.

2114
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:33,660
I guess the demo was pretty good.

2115
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:34,700
It does look interesting.

2116
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:36,300
Yeah, it does look interesting.

2117
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:36,940
Dark Sakura.

2118
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:39,280
Yeah.

2119
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:44,380
So anyone remember the toxic, the toxic Avenger?

2120
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:44,940
Vaguely.

2121
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:45,440
Yeah.

2122
02:00:45,980 --> 02:00:49,100
Remember that there was a cartoon called the toxic Crusaders?

2123
02:00:50,220 --> 02:00:50,720
Yes.

2124
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:57,180
So it's the original TV series remastering is going to be on Steam.

2125
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:00,540
The TV show?

2126
02:01:00,540 --> 02:01:01,100
The TV.

2127
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:10,060
Well, actually they're going to do a scrolling brawler based off of the TV show, which honestly,

2128
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:15,980
I barely tolerated the movies and I hated the cartoon, so I have zero interest in this,

2129
02:01:16,700 --> 02:01:21,500
but Hey, some people will absolutely love it and more power to them.

2130
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:25,420
All right.

2131
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:28,140
I guess you can always check that out in Steam and decide for yourself.

2132
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:35,020
Um, lastly, Sunsoft is going to be doing a crowdfunding campaign through campfire.

2133
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:39,100
That's more of a Japanese based website because these are definitely going to be

2134
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:40,700
Japanese based games.

2135
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:44,540
Uh, you know, Sunsoft, you might remember from games like blaster master Fester's quest.

2136
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:46,860
We're not, we're not talking about these games, talking about, you know, games that

2137
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:51,740
never came over here, uh, to the U S as far as I know, but now the blast master music

2138
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:52,460
is stuck in my head.

2139
02:01:52,460 --> 02:01:53,020
Thanks, Rob.

2140
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:53,260
Good.

2141
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:53,820
You're welcome.

2142
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:54,860
It's Hey, you know what?

2143
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:56,300
That's great music to have stuck in your head.

2144
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:56,780
You're welcome.

2145
02:01:58,540 --> 02:02:02,780
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

2146
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:02,940
Okay.

2147
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:06,140
Anyway, um, we're going to do for the rest of the episode.

2148
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:06,860
Yeah, absolutely.

2149
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:08,220
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

2150
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:14,300
Uh, anyway, campfire crowdfunding campaign will be bringing three Famicom titles to switch

2151
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:18,940
and PC via steam in celebration of the Famicom's 40th anniversary.

2152
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:23,500
The crowdfunding campaign runs July 14th through August 31st.

2153
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:26,220
The three titles that they're planning on porting.

2154
02:02:26,220 --> 02:02:34,860
Kanshaku, Tamanege, Kantaro, No Tuikaido, Goju-san Sugi, uh, the wings of, or excuse

2155
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:40,460
me, the wing of medulla and ripple Island, which I don't think any of those were released

2156
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:40,860
over here.

2157
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:42,700
I don't recognize any of those names.

2158
02:02:42,700 --> 02:02:46,700
Um, but you know, sunsoft released a lot in Japan that he didn't put out over here.

2159
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:51,980
Uh, they're also thinking about maybe doing a sunsoft branded golden cartridge that they

2160
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,780
were not able to do back in the Famicom days.

2161
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:58,860
Uh, only seven publishers back in the day were allowed to engrave their own brand names

2162
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:00,460
on, on cartridges.

2163
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:04,300
Sunsoft was one of them, but they were never able to do the gold cartridges because they

2164
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:05,740
didn't have the budget for it.

2165
02:03:05,740 --> 02:03:09,100
So that's kind of interesting that they might do that after all this time.

2166
02:03:09,100 --> 02:03:13,260
But, um, yeah, if that's of interest to you, you'll have to get on a Japanese crowdfunding

2167
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:18,060
website campfire and take a look for that sunsoft in mid July.

2168
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:23,580
So anyway, um, moving on, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

2169
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,620
of some games you'll be playing a little sooner than this rerelease.

02:08:22,540 --> 02:08:27,580
pirates of the Amchyridion, I guess.

2252
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:28,380
Yeah.

2253
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:33,980
Um, also Ben 10 power trip, a hotel Transylvania three monsters overboard.

2254
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:39,260
Then Ben 10 and then transformers battlegrounds where apparently according to the cover,

2255
02:08:39,260 --> 02:08:44,700
they fight for a D 20 and then, um, troll hunters defenders of Arcadia.

2256
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:49,100
I know it's the matrix, but it looks like a D 20.

2257
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:52,160
All right.

2258
02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:58,460
Lots of games everywhere going into, uh, what will be here in the U S a long weekend for,

2259
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:00,700
uh, many folks with the 4th of July.

2260
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:04,620
I don't know why the rest of the world is so hopping, but yeah, there you go.

2261
02:09:04,620 --> 02:09:05,420
For reasons.

2262
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:05,980
Yeah.

2263
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:09,660
So I guess, you know, summertime, uh, you know, all right.

2264
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:14,060
Uh, let's get into a few more stories and then we're going to open up discord for a

2265
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:18,540
little bit and see if we can't get, um, some, uh, calls there on discord.

2266
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:20,780
Uh, let's get to this story from Loki.

2267
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:22,060
Yeah.

2268
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:26,460
So I think it was last week or maybe the week before we talked about some of the content

2269
02:09:26,460 --> 02:09:28,380
being removed from grand theft auto online.

2270
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:34,060
Well, there's also discrepancies between what is available for grand theft online between

2271
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:35,660
console and PC.

2272
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:42,940
And in fact, actually, uh, some of the content that is available on console doesn't get PC

2273
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:49,340
ports, which is weird because you'd think there'd be parody when it comes to PC and

2274
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:55,580
current gen consoles, but for whatever reason, for grand theft auto online, they just aren't

2275
02:09:55,580 --> 02:09:56,220
doing that.

2276
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:59,580
Um, so that's strange.

2277
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:07,260
They're saying that, of course, you know, um, with, you know, the, like some of the

2278
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:11,180
different updates they've done with like the Vinewood car club and stuff like that.

2279
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:16,540
Certain features are only accessible through GTA plus.

2280
02:10:17,420 --> 02:10:24,300
Um, which is of course that paid service that you can get through PlayStation or Xbox, but

2281
02:10:24,300 --> 02:10:29,180
GTA plus is not something that you can subscribe to on PC.

2282
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:33,580
Probably because people rip all the content out and make it in a mod and stuff like that.

2283
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:37,660
That's always been an issue with like rockstar games and porting stuff to PC anyways, because

2284
02:10:37,660 --> 02:10:40,620
they're worried that people will mod stuff in the game.

2285
02:10:41,340 --> 02:10:42,620
Which yes, they do that.

2286
02:10:42,620 --> 02:10:47,580
Um, maybe not grand theft auto online, but I mean, they probably still would do that

2287
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:47,980
as well.

2288
02:10:48,780 --> 02:10:56,540
So there is a disparity between what they have on console versus PC, which is kind of

2289
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:57,500
annoying.

2290
02:10:57,500 --> 02:11:03,580
So maybe there's, you know, that's leading to people to believe that maybe they're going

2291
02:11:03,580 --> 02:11:06,300
to be discontinuing PlayStation online for PC.

2292
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:11,180
I don't think so because I think they make enough in shark cards to make up for that,

2293
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:16,940
but it is weird to see some sort of like difference in content that's available for

2294
02:11:16,940 --> 02:11:17,260
both.

2295
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:26,860
So, I mean, how, how mad are you about this?

2296
02:11:26,860 --> 02:11:27,980
Or is it not at all?

2297
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:29,340
Because I don't play grand theft auto online.

2298
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:31,980
You're like, you know, give a shit about grand theft auto online.

2299
02:11:31,980 --> 02:11:32,380
No, I know.

2300
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:37,820
And I think a lot of it is, it's probably going back to, you know, how they're paywalling

2301
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:43,020
stuff now behind that GTA plus, which is stupid anyways, because like, why?

2302
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:47,500
Like you don't make billions of dollars off of shark cards already, which you do, because

2303
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:49,340
we know that because you've said that.

2304
02:11:50,140 --> 02:11:55,340
But like on top of that, you want more recurring like revenue, like through these, the service.

2305
02:11:55,340 --> 02:12:00,060
And why don't you offer that service on, I mean, on console?

2306
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:02,220
Because I are on PC as well.

2307
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:07,580
Because I mean, a lot of the new models of cars wherever have already been available

2308
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:09,340
in game, and then they took them out.

2309
02:12:09,980 --> 02:12:14,220
So this doesn't make any sense that like, you would just now all of a sudden hold that

2310
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:14,620
back.

2311
02:12:14,620 --> 02:12:18,460
I mean, not that it would be impossible for somebody to rip that data out of like the

2312
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:23,660
console version port at the PC, except probably easily a thing that's being done if it's

2313
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:25,980
anything like four used to be.

2314
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:30,540
Yeah, I don't know.

2315
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:34,700
I don't really understand how Rockstar Games is operating.

2316
02:12:34,700 --> 02:12:38,940
I'm curious to see what they do with Grand Theft Auto six for sure.

2317
02:12:38,940 --> 02:12:40,620
Yeah, one of these years.

2318
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:46,220
This probably this year, because they said they're making a lot of money next year.

2319
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:49,740
A lot of money that's outside of Grand Theft Auto online.

2320
02:12:49,740 --> 02:12:51,500
So got to be it.

2321
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:52,620
All right.

2322
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:55,020
Let's move on.

2323
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:55,740
Dark Sakura.

2324
02:12:57,580 --> 02:13:01,020
Well, Sonic stuff is happening.

2325
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:03,820
And this picture of Lego Sonic is creepy.

2326
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:08,940
So it's also Sonic the Hedgehog's 32nd anniversary.

2327
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:14,700
And there was a 20-minute Sonic Central showcase to talk about stuff.

2328
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:19,740
There is, of course, the 2D Sonic Superstars.

2329
02:13:20,460 --> 02:13:28,620
And there are Sonic Origins Plus, which is expanded version of the original Sonic Origins.

2330
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:32,380
And it adds Amy Rose as a playable.

2331
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:38,700
There's a Sonic Frontier, Sonic's Birthday Bash, a Roblox Sonic Speed Simulator,

2332
02:13:40,060 --> 02:13:47,180
Sonic Prime, which is an animated Netflix thing, mobile games getting some updates,

2333
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:54,300
Samba de Amigo Party Central, Sonic Symphony, which is the touring orchestra.

2334
02:13:55,340 --> 02:13:57,100
I'm trying to see if it's going to be anywhere near us.

2335
02:13:57,100 --> 02:13:59,900
And that's just going to be Los Angeles on September 30th.

2336
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:05,020
So, well, Tails Tube, which is a series about Tails being a VTuber.

2337
02:14:05,020 --> 02:14:18,540
And then also Lego has a trailer for Sonic Superstar.

2338
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:23,260
So basically it's Sonic as a mini fig.

2339
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:26,780
That's kind of cute.

2340
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:29,820
Interesting.

2341
02:14:30,700 --> 02:14:36,460
As Jodhana Matt says, Sonic is 32, nearing its age for its first midlife crisis.

2342
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:40,700
Yeah, that is nowhere near midlife anymore.

2343
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:41,340
True, true.

2344
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:46,140
That doesn't mean we don't have pre midlife crisis around that age.

2345
02:14:47,020 --> 02:14:49,020
I just have constant crises.

2346
02:14:49,020 --> 02:14:53,020
Yeah, I'm constantly in a state of all right.

2347
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:55,180
I'm internally screaming all the time.

2348
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:56,300
My soul is hoarse.

2349
02:14:57,180 --> 02:14:59,180
Uh, Loki, what do you got?

2350
02:14:59,180 --> 02:15:00,300
Your grief, I see.

2351
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:01,020
Totally.

2352
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:08,060
I did like, though, that one of the things that they did announce it at that whole Sonic

2353
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:10,940
event thing was they had more Lego sets.

2354
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:15,340
One of them is like some sort of like Eggman Sonic thing.

2355
02:15:15,980 --> 02:15:17,500
But you know what it looked like?

2356
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:18,300
It was like ugly.

2357
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:20,380
It looked like Ugly Sonic.

2358
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:22,540
Ugly Sonic, the Lego set.

2359
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:24,220
And I'm kind of all about that.

2360
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:27,820
That is what freaked me out.

2361
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:29,020
So I was looking at Fixie's name.

2362
02:15:29,900 --> 02:15:31,340
Yeah, I like that.

2363
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:35,260
I will be checking that out when that comes into stores.

2364
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,580
Anyways, let's talk about Roblox.

2365
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:43,900
So Roblox, it's a game for kids.

2366
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:46,620
Those kids are getting older.

2367
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:49,420
I mean, my kids have been playing it for years now.

2368
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:50,780
It's hard to believe.

2369
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:55,500
And so now because their demographic is aging up, they're starting to look at, hey, you

2370
02:15:55,500 --> 02:16:01,180
know, maybe we should make content that's geared towards those kids that are now aged

2371
02:16:01,180 --> 02:16:02,620
past 17.

2372
02:16:02,620 --> 02:16:07,980
So they're saying right now that 17 to 24 year olds are the fastest growing group on

2373
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:08,540
Roblox.

2374
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:13,820
I'm just shocked because they're the group over 18 are playing that game.

2375
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:16,700
Because they're the group that was 11 when this game first came out.

2376
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:19,820
I mean, yeah, I guess there's literally people that have grown up with this game.

2377
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:21,020
That's what it's about.

2378
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:25,020
That's the cool thing for games to do nowadays.

2379
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:25,420
You know what?

2380
02:16:25,420 --> 02:16:28,780
Final Fantasy, Death, F Word, Left and Right.

2381
02:16:28,780 --> 02:16:29,340
You know what?

2382
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:31,580
Roblox, Full Frontal, if that's what they want to do.

2383
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:34,620
Well, I don't know if they're going that far yet.

2384
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:36,460
Maybe they'll be the next update.

2385
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:41,740
But right now they're going to be they said right now they have their they're adding a

2386
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:43,580
17 plus category.

2387
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:49,900
And so right now they're 13 plus category may contain moderate violence, light realistic

2388
02:16:49,900 --> 02:16:54,860
blood, moderate crude humor and or unplayable gambling content.

2389
02:16:55,580 --> 02:17:01,580
17 plus category, though, will take it up with intense violence, heavy realistic blood,

2390
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:08,220
moderate crude humor, romantic themes, unplayable gambling content and or the presence of alcohol.

2391
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:11,340
Finally, Roblox sounds interesting.

2392
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:17,580
But they said in order to get access to that, they're going to need you need to submit your

2393
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:19,980
government ID.

2394
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:23,740
Oh, forget you.

2395
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:27,820
Like the fact I have a credit card should be enough to prove that I'm 18.

2396
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:28,220
Right?

2397
02:17:28,220 --> 02:17:32,940
I mean, obviously, so many kids just take their parents, but still, I'm not I'm not

2398
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:37,420
submitting anyone my government ID, besides the government.

2399
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:40,620
Like, you don't need it.

2400
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:41,820
Yeah.

2401
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:43,020
Tojiki doll in chat.

2402
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:46,140
Hi, by the way, says, Do they want my Social Security, too?

2403
02:17:46,140 --> 02:17:50,540
Like, honestly, can you read the last three on the back of the credit card and your blood

2404
02:17:50,540 --> 02:17:50,860
type?

2405
02:17:50,860 --> 02:17:53,020
And it's exhausting.

2406
02:17:54,780 --> 02:18:01,740
Yeah, I would just say just if you're going to Roblox and play mature rated games, you're

2407
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:03,020
better off just try going.

2408
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:07,100
Yeah, go literally anywhere else on the Internet and you can find because you have to you have

2409
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:11,100
to understand a lot of these are still made by young developers and stuff.

2410
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:15,020
And they're not necessarily full fledged games either.

2411
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:17,580
So like, I don't know.

2412
02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:22,140
So it's just the Roblox F word experience where now they can get away with saying fuck

2413
02:18:22,140 --> 02:18:23,500
in a Roblox game, right?

2414
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:26,540
Kind of.

2415
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:26,780
Yeah.

2416
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:27,660
All right.

2417
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:29,500
Roblox gets its very own fuck show.

2418
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:30,460
Love it.

2419
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:31,580
All right.

2420
02:18:31,580 --> 02:18:39,660
Well, where Roblox opens its doors to keep on growing, one game is finally shutting down.

2421
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:40,620
That's right.

2422
02:18:40,700 --> 02:18:44,540
One of the oldest MMOs, although actually, this game is so old.

2423
02:18:44,540 --> 02:18:45,820
Don't you mean a visual mud?

2424
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:49,100
Yeah, it's well, if you didn't cut me off, I would have got there.

2425
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:56,700
But yes, so it's more instead of an MMO, it's more what was a graphical interpretation of

2426
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:57,260
MUD.

2427
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:03,340
It's a game known as the Realm Online, and it's finally going to be shutting down after

2428
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:05,980
27 years.

2429
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:10,780
This game was launched in the 90s, and it's finally going to be closing.

2430
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:17,500
And yeah, this game is where we got things like Ultima Online, EverQuest, and then obviously

2431
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:24,060
those evolved into Final Fantasy 14 and wow, which will eventually evolve into the holodeck.

2432
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:27,420
But yes, the Realm Online is kind of where it all started.

2433
02:19:27,420 --> 02:19:30,860
I can't really say because I mean, if you think about it's a graphical MUD, well, then

2434
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:33,420
there were MUDs that inspired the Realm Online.

2435
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:39,260
But if you don't know what like a MUD or a multi user dungeon is a lot because I used

2436
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:43,900
to play a couple of these in college, many of them were text or they are really text

2437
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:45,260
based or ASCII art.

2438
02:19:45,260 --> 02:19:47,660
Yeah, it was like as far as you could get with those.

2439
02:19:48,460 --> 02:19:49,980
But this took it a step further.

2440
02:19:50,620 --> 02:19:54,060
I think of BBS door games.

2441
02:19:54,700 --> 02:20:00,380
And when we first started to see clients, well, I remember the pit distinctly was the

2442
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:07,260
one that had a graphical client then that you could launch to play the pit in the graphical

2443
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:10,060
client like this is kind of like that for MUDs.

2444
02:20:10,060 --> 02:20:14,300
But anyway, this yeah, this game is very, very old.

2445
02:20:14,300 --> 02:20:20,060
And after all of this time, it was posted on the Realm Online forums on Wednesday, June

2446
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:23,660
21st, that the shutdown will be occurring.

2447
02:20:23,660 --> 02:20:27,900
We are sad to inform you of a sudden and unexpected end to our journey together.

2448
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:33,500
The current agreement we have with Norseman Games gives us no path to acquiring the IP.

2449
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:39,340
This impedes our ability to direct more money into developing content of the game.

2450
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:43,180
So the game servers will be shut down on June 30th.

2451
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:48,540
So that's like that's about as much notice as Paramount Plus gave Queens of the Universe

2452
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:49,660
and Star Trek Prodigy.

2453
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:58,140
It's it's these are very fast polls, but also the financial year for many, many companies

2454
02:20:58,140 --> 02:20:59,420
starts July 1st.

2455
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:02,620
And that's why this timing usually is what it is.

2456
02:21:02,620 --> 02:21:05,180
So very sad.

2457
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:07,100
You have a few more days to check it out.

2458
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:12,300
Otherwise, I guess it will live on in YouTube contents or it will just grow underground

2459
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:14,380
as some of these things tend to do.

2460
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:19,820
Hello, Phantasy Star Online blueburst and that sort of content.

2461
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:22,380
So a lot of times these things have been going underground.

2462
02:21:22,380 --> 02:21:29,580
So all right, we are to the part of the show where we invite y'all to participate with

2463
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:36,220
us via email via Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord, and you can join our green

2464
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:36,620
room.

2465
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:38,220
I do see we have somebody waiting.

2466
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:39,340
I just want to check real quick.

2467
02:21:39,340 --> 02:21:43,100
I don't think we have emails tonight, but I just want to check in and kind of ping that.

2468
02:21:45,100 --> 02:21:46,060
We had one.

2469
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:46,620
Oh, we do.

2470
02:21:46,620 --> 02:21:46,860
Okay.

2471
02:21:46,860 --> 02:21:47,360
Yay.

2472
02:21:48,060 --> 02:21:48,460
Yeah.

2473
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:49,980
And I need to call it out.

2474
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:52,860
Thank you, fifth dream for sending me a picture of a cat.

2475
02:21:52,860 --> 02:21:54,140
Oh, yay.

2476
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:55,580
Okay, that's right.

2477
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:57,180
This is a picture of a cat.

2478
02:21:57,180 --> 02:21:58,220
Her name is Echo.

2479
02:21:58,220 --> 02:22:00,380
Her favorite video game is Stray, probably.

2480
02:22:02,140 --> 02:22:03,660
Echo has been downloaded.

2481
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:12,700
And when I have more photos, ahem, people, then there will be an update to the cat preview.

2482
02:22:13,020 --> 02:22:16,460
And maybe other animals might be included.

2483
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:17,420
Let's see.

2484
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:20,220
I just wanted to make sure that I would love a ferret.

2485
02:22:20,220 --> 02:22:28,060
Um, we got this dreams cat a little bit of love there.

2486
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:29,100
So there you go.

2487
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:30,940
I don't want to beauty.

2488
02:22:30,940 --> 02:22:32,380
I want to boop the nose.

2489
02:22:32,380 --> 02:22:34,540
Yeah, that's a very boopable nose.

2490
02:22:34,540 --> 02:22:37,500
Sorry, I took that down real quick because I realized the background is still visible.

2491
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:41,180
Now there's anything that protected in there, but I just yeah, you don't need to see how

2492
02:22:41,180 --> 02:22:43,180
many unread messages I keep in my email.

2493
02:22:43,180 --> 02:22:46,300
All right, um, let's move on.

2494
02:22:46,300 --> 02:22:48,380
Oh, I've seen your desktop, Rob.

2495
02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:49,180
I'm not surprised.

2496
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:51,100
All right.

2497
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:52,620
Excuse me.

2498
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:53,820
We have a caller in the green room.

2499
02:22:53,820 --> 02:22:55,580
I would love to bring them on and have a chat.

2500
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:59,260
So let's do just that and welcome them onto the show.

2501
02:22:59,260 --> 02:23:01,260
Hello, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2502
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:01,760
Who's this?

2503
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:04,940
Hi, it's your neighborhood Fixie.

2504
02:23:04,940 --> 02:23:06,060
Hey, Fixie.

2505
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:06,860
How are you?

2506
02:23:06,860 --> 02:23:10,460
Fixation Gaze here on Twitch.television.

2507
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:11,260
How are you today?

2508
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:13,580
I'm doing fantastic.

2509
02:23:13,580 --> 02:23:15,180
I have finally gotten over my cough.

2510
02:23:15,180 --> 02:23:17,660
And so now I sound like a normal person again.

2511
02:23:17,660 --> 02:23:19,900
I'm really worried about you too.

2512
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:22,140
I'm there with you a little bit.

2513
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:25,420
I don't think I had what you had, but I've been sick for like the last three weeks.

2514
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:29,580
I still cough every now and then, but it's finally like, finally, they gave me a stronger

2515
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:30,860
antibiotic this week.

2516
02:23:30,860 --> 02:23:33,660
And it actually helped this time.

2517
02:23:33,660 --> 02:23:34,380
So it's nice.

2518
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:37,740
Yeah, no, I had a really weird cough.

2519
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:41,580
And then it turned into like an almost 104 temperature.

2520
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:43,260
I just took some NyQuil, went to bed.

2521
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:45,100
I don't have the insurance for that.

2522
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:46,620
Oh, golly golly.

2523
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:47,900
I'm doing much better now.

2524
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:53,340
Today, I wanted to bring forth a bit of a philosophical question about video games

2525
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:54,460
and the future of them.

2526
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:56,140
Okay, go for it.

2527
02:23:57,660 --> 02:24:04,380
So with the rise of movies, you see like the Mario movie, the Sonic movies, which have

2528
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:09,580
been questionably successful, even Dead by Daylight is throwing itself into the movie

2529
02:24:09,580 --> 02:24:12,540
ring with a Blumhouse movie coming out in the next few years.

2530
02:24:13,180 --> 02:24:14,380
Five Nights Around the Corner.

2531
02:24:14,380 --> 02:24:16,300
Yeah, lots, lots of this video game media.

2532
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:16,800
Yeah.

2533
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:21,260
I feel like there's going to be a renaissance that's going to happen that sort of happened

2534
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:26,220
to the tabletop community when Stranger Things was like, cool, look, D&D is fun.

2535
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:29,660
And it's going to be a big like, like, how do you think that's going to happen in the

2536
02:24:29,660 --> 02:24:34,300
way of like, normal, quote unquote, normal people who are not in the gamer lifestyle,

2537
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:38,380
seeing games from a different perspective from the movie perspective, kind of like the

2538
02:24:38,380 --> 02:24:43,660
FNAF movie is going to do inevitably, and coming into these spaces, not really knowing

2539
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:48,540
what's going on, and the amount of gatekeeping that is going to sadly happen, because it

2540
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:51,740
seems that that's the way that this is going to kind of go.

2541
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:56,140
Look what happened to the comic industry with all the new people wanting to catch up on

2542
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:02,140
uh, Marvel storylines and how com- they're convoluted, okay?

2543
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:02,640
Yeah.

2544
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:05,740
It was happening, happening there.

2545
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:08,780
And of course, oh, I've been a fan before the movies came out.

2546
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:13,900
Yeah, it's a complicated question of what's going to happen when the gaming community

2547
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:17,980
and the movie community are going to inevitably kind of mesh together.

2548
02:25:18,860 --> 02:25:22,380
Because sometimes you get really good stuff like the, you know, like, I will say the new

2549
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:28,220
Mario movie is serviceable, it's okay, but movie critics hated it because it had no quote

2550
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:32,460
unquote plot and was just a go to this place, go to this place, go to this place, but to

2551
02:25:32,460 --> 02:25:35,660
gamers who have grown up with Mario, that's a Mario game.

2552
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:39,180
That is exactly what you do in a Mario game, except Peach is there.

2553
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:42,860
So what do you think about that?

2554
02:25:42,860 --> 02:25:47,260
About the fact that quote unquote, like, normal people who have no idea what these games are

2555
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:51,500
are about to be exposed to different kind of gaming things and exploding in that way.

2556
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:52,860
You know, I'm stewing on this question.

2557
02:25:52,860 --> 02:25:53,900
This is a very good question.

2558
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:55,260
I'm stewing on this a little bit.

2559
02:25:55,260 --> 02:26:00,860
And honestly, where my brain is going, is I actually feel like the video game industry

2560
02:26:00,860 --> 02:26:03,980
has already had to start responding to this.

2561
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:08,700
And what I mean by that is, the video game industry has been forced in the last, I would

2562
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:13,500
say, five, six years to, for lack of a better term, grow the fuck up.

2563
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:19,180
And what I mean by that is a lot of what you saw that happened with the Me Too movement,

2564
02:26:19,740 --> 02:26:23,980
and how that ultimately started impacting the game industry, a lot of these horrible

2565
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:28,540
things that we found out were happening inside game, you know, industry development, and

2566
02:26:28,540 --> 02:26:34,060
some of the work cultures, and some of the workers rights, all of that has been bubbling

2567
02:26:34,060 --> 02:26:36,060
up for the last few years.

2568
02:26:36,060 --> 02:26:37,100
We're not there yet.

2569
02:26:37,100 --> 02:26:42,300
We can't say, we have successfully conquered being an adult here in the video game industry.

2570
02:26:42,300 --> 02:26:47,420
But I think if you look at today, versus what things look like, you know, five, 10 years

2571
02:26:47,420 --> 02:26:52,300
ago, but even like five years ago, or just pre pandemic, quite honestly, I think you

2572
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:58,380
go like, wow, things have shifted at a rapid or pace than it did in the beginnings of this

2573
02:26:58,380 --> 02:26:58,700
industry.

2574
02:26:58,700 --> 02:27:03,980
Because if you go way back to the beginning of this industry, let's be real, the Atari

2575
02:27:03,980 --> 02:27:09,580
2600, and the Atari development community, and I'm looping any, you know, old school

2576
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:13,900
cartridge based company game in this was very much a boys club industry.

2577
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:17,580
I do know there were absolutely important women that contributed but let's be real,

2578
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:18,700
it was a boys club.

2579
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:24,060
A lot of those old and not only was it that it was heavily drug influenced.

2580
02:27:24,060 --> 02:27:28,780
A lot of your favorite games were absolutely cocaine influenced.

2581
02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:33,900
Do you think that with the general public actually seeing gaming industry?

2582
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:35,820
Do you think it would wisen them up?

2583
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:41,420
Or do you think it would just basically be a whole bunch of like, no, no, no, I don't

2584
02:27:41,420 --> 02:27:43,420
want to really want to get into the game side of the community?

2585
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:48,380
Do you think that the gaming community will actually have to like the gamers who are in

2586
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:48,860
those games?

2587
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:52,780
Because you always get your 12 year old cod lobby like stereotype.

2588
02:27:53,900 --> 02:27:57,820
Do you think this is going to change the way that normal like everyday nine to five people

2589
02:27:57,820 --> 02:28:02,220
who don't play video games are going to play or view video games because of the movies

2590
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:03,020
that are coming out?

2591
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:04,460
I think it's already happening.

2592
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:07,180
Yeah, I think some of that shift is already happening.

2593
02:28:07,180 --> 02:28:12,860
But along with that, you just generally have more, you know, when we and I know you're

2594
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:17,500
younger than we are fixie and but I'm not trying to get an age thing because when I'm

2595
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:21,980
trying even when even when you were younger, but especially when we were younger, it really

2596
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,180
seemed like oh my god, video games are such a niche thing.

2597
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:27,180
It's a basement nerd thing.

2598
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:31,100
Like you see Dungeons and Dragons portrayed in Stranger Things, which you brought up before

2599
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:32,540
like that's how a lot of video is.

2600
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:34,620
But now was like that in the 80s.

2601
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:35,580
That's true.

2602
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:41,740
But like I feel like really in this day and age, so many there's far less people that

2603
02:28:41,740 --> 02:28:46,460
don't play video games, then do play some kind of video game.

2604
02:28:46,460 --> 02:28:49,340
But you have to meet, you know, Tetris is a video game.

2605
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:51,260
Pokemon Go is a video game.

2606
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:55,660
Facebook games are video games.

2607
02:28:56,380 --> 02:29:01,100
I'm trying to think of other huge mobile titles that you know, wordscapes and word word with

2608
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:03,180
friends are Candy Crush.

2609
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:04,780
That's what I was trying to think of perfect.

2610
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:05,660
Those are all games.

2611
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:11,500
And because of that, the there are more women gamers than men because there are all different

2612
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:18,540
because on planet Earth, there are 51% women and you know, men, birth assignment rates.

2613
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:26,620
And so you just have more that play games than you did back in the 80s when it felt

2614
02:29:26,620 --> 02:29:29,420
like it was a social elite type of club.

2615
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:32,540
So I don't know, I feel like in some ways I'm talking in circles, but I also just kind

2616
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:38,860
of go like, there's just like the gaming industry, most people are already in it.

2617
02:29:38,940 --> 02:29:40,140
But I do get what you're saying.

2618
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:44,300
There's also a fine line between like, because when you bring up like the Call of Duty lobbies

2619
02:29:44,300 --> 02:29:46,220
with the 12 year olds and all that, sure.

2620
02:29:46,220 --> 02:29:51,660
There's definitely a fine line between hardcore gaming and casual gaming.

2621
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:54,540
Like there's still kind of some different camps there, right?

2622
02:29:54,540 --> 02:29:56,940
So does this cause more people to get into hardcore gaming?

2623
02:29:58,060 --> 02:30:02,620
I meet people in real life who think that video gaming is just like cod lobbies.

2624
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:05,980
They don't actually understand that there's a skill or a talent into it.

2625
02:30:05,980 --> 02:30:10,460
They think it's just like your childish if you play video games and they refuse to change

2626
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:11,260
that sort of thing.

2627
02:30:11,260 --> 02:30:17,260
But now with gaming becoming prevalent and becoming with like entertainment industry,

2628
02:30:17,260 --> 02:30:22,140
because gaming and streaming is moving towards the entertainment industry and a lot of people

2629
02:30:22,140 --> 02:30:23,900
are starting to notice that.

2630
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:28,940
So it's going to become something a lot bigger than it is currently now, I think, especially

2631
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:32,780
if more franchises are making TV shows and movies.

2632
02:30:33,100 --> 02:30:37,420
There's another thing to consider too, is that almost the reverse was happening.

2633
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:42,220
That video games themselves were becoming more cinematic.

2634
02:30:43,020 --> 02:30:47,820
And so there was a greater expectation for more complicated stories, like the things

2635
02:30:47,820 --> 02:30:50,220
that you would see in a movie or a TV series.

2636
02:30:50,780 --> 02:31:00,860
So with that sort of, I'm going to say genre level crossover, that it's already a natural

2637
02:31:00,860 --> 02:31:01,420
progression.

2638
02:31:02,140 --> 02:31:05,500
It's going to happen whether people like it or not.

2639
02:31:05,500 --> 02:31:10,620
They're going to see this and they're not going to necessarily think, oh, this was a

2640
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:11,420
video game thing.

2641
02:31:11,420 --> 02:31:18,060
I mean, there will be obvious ones, but they'll look at it and go, oh, it's an action movie.

2642
02:31:18,860 --> 02:31:21,500
You know, have that level of separation in their head.

2643
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:30,620
I think, though, that since a lot of the older adults today now were growing up with

2644
02:31:30,620 --> 02:31:33,500
gaming, the mindset's there.

2645
02:31:33,500 --> 02:31:41,740
It's not going to be as underground as it was when we were all kids.

2646
02:31:41,740 --> 02:31:47,980
Yeah, I think gaming has, in a lot of where gaming goes, you just have to look to Hollywood

2647
02:31:47,980 --> 02:31:51,820
and where the rest of motion picture television industry has kind of gone.

2648
02:31:51,820 --> 02:31:56,620
I feel like gaming's walked a very similar path, but just kind of a few years behind.

2649
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:59,100
I brought up the Me Too movement and its impact in gaming.

2650
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:01,260
Well, that started as a Hollywood thing, right?

2651
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:04,380
And we heard about all the horrific things that were happening with the casting couches,

2652
02:32:04,380 --> 02:32:05,100
et cetera, et cetera.

2653
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:07,180
I won't get into it, but you all read it.

2654
02:32:07,180 --> 02:32:17,420
But I feel like gaming is walking down a very similar path as we accept as a consciousness,

2655
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:22,700
as a social community, as we accept gaming more and more as an art form.

2656
02:32:24,060 --> 02:32:25,100
You know what I mean?

2657
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:30,940
So it's interesting how gaming has kind of had to grow up along with that.

2658
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:39,420
So yeah, but it's hard for me to picture like who that is that sees a movie and goes,

2659
02:32:39,420 --> 02:32:43,500
gosh, but I guess it would be like maybe the game that is based on that movie.

2660
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:46,540
It should have happened with the Warcraft movie.

2661
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:51,100
If the Warcraft movie had kind of landed bigger is that you would expect that there would be

2662
02:32:51,100 --> 02:32:54,860
people that would see the Warcraft movie and then want to go play World of Warcraft.

2663
02:32:54,860 --> 02:32:57,820
But was World of Warcraft very accessible at that time?

2664
02:32:57,820 --> 02:33:01,660
Or did it have a lot of edgelords that would yell at people trying to do looking for group

2665
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:02,300
type of stuff?

2666
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:07,820
But then maybe that's also part of the reason the movie bombed, except in China.

2667
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:11,820
One of the other things that I also noticed was we kind of got a little bit of a setback

2668
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:15,020
in the public eye when it came to the movie Ready Player One.

2669
02:33:16,780 --> 02:33:21,100
Yeah, they really botched that one.

2670
02:33:21,100 --> 02:33:27,260
Yeah, but I will say in like a response to Ready Player One, that Free Guy was a very

2671
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:33,420
good movie to kind of be like, hey, look, a multiplayer game that's like GTA that actually

2672
02:33:34,700 --> 02:33:39,500
even though there's like the oh yeah, AI consciousness, this guy realizes he's in a game

2673
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:44,380
and I kind of ignore that in the fact of like, they portray video games pretty good.

2674
02:33:44,380 --> 02:33:47,500
And then of course, they're like, Oh my God, yeah, Fortnite moment in Free Guy.

2675
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:51,340
But it's a very beautiful story in that way.

2676
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:56,060
And I think that might have been the kickoff to be like, okay, maybe gaming movies aren't

2677
02:33:56,060 --> 02:33:56,540
so bad.

2678
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:59,900
And then you got your Sonic movie, and then you got your Mario movie.

2679
02:33:59,900 --> 02:34:03,980
That's it is that gaming movies were always the laughing stock of Hollywood.

2680
02:34:03,980 --> 02:34:05,340
They were always bad.

2681
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:06,380
They were never good.

2682
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:11,100
But even yeah, that's a Pikachu came out, though.

2683
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:14,060
That was before Free Guy, was it?

2684
02:34:14,060 --> 02:34:14,540
Yes.

2685
02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:18,700
Okay, well, then I will take back my claim for Free Guy and say Pikachu move because

2686
02:34:18,700 --> 02:34:19,660
Detective Pikachu.

2687
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:22,460
That is just masterpiece.

2688
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:22,940
Hang it up.

2689
02:34:22,940 --> 02:34:23,580
That's beautiful.

2690
02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:29,980
I will even say, though, that perhaps it was the introduction of successful comic movies

2691
02:34:30,540 --> 02:34:34,940
that led to a natural progression toward video game movies.

2692
02:34:37,340 --> 02:34:43,020
Because I've seen I even though it's not a great movie, I still love the Dolph Lundgren

2693
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:43,820
Punisher movie.

2694
02:34:44,460 --> 02:34:47,820
And I have seen the old Fantastic Four movie that never got released.

2695
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:50,220
And it was better than advertised.

2696
02:34:51,340 --> 02:34:52,700
I will also come along.

2697
02:34:52,700 --> 02:34:54,060
I'm really scared of that.

2698
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:58,300
I'm really scared of it becoming like the next comics of movies.

2699
02:34:58,300 --> 02:35:00,300
Like, because I love comic movies.

2700
02:35:00,300 --> 02:35:01,740
I will never say that I do not.

2701
02:35:01,740 --> 02:35:05,180
But I feel like we're getting a lot of it shoved down our throats in the way of turning

2702
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:06,380
comics into content.

2703
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:08,700
Yeah, it's it's as it's.

2704
02:35:10,700 --> 02:35:11,900
Sorry, continue.

2705
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:13,180
No, no, no, I'm agreeing with you.

2706
02:35:13,180 --> 02:35:13,980
I'm agreeing with you.

2707
02:35:13,980 --> 02:35:15,100
Yeah, it's the same thing.

2708
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:19,660
Although I also have certain things in that pick about the comic industry itself and what

2709
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:20,780
they're doing with storylines.

2710
02:35:20,780 --> 02:35:25,100
But yeah, but I'm just scared that suddenly everything all the games that you want to

2711
02:35:25,100 --> 02:35:30,060
see, like instead of because the thing that happened specifically with like, also, oh

2712
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:31,260
my God, what was that game?

2713
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:36,220
Neighbor Hello Neighbor, that game that everyone is super excited about because it had a cool

2714
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:38,780
premise and the game learned with you and it got harder to do.

2715
02:35:39,340 --> 02:35:44,380
They completely bombed it because the developers weren't focusing on the game and on the like,

2716
02:35:44,380 --> 02:35:46,860
getting it out of alpha and finishing it.

2717
02:35:46,860 --> 02:35:51,180
But with the book series and a TV series that wasn't about the game, but about the game

2718
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:52,940
and franchising and movies.

2719
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:57,500
And because they were so focused on what they were going to do after the game, they didn't

2720
02:35:57,500 --> 02:35:58,540
finish it properly.

2721
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:02,380
And that's something I'm scared that developers are going to start to lean towards more as

2722
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:05,980
they see big studios coming out with movies about their games.

2723
02:36:06,620 --> 02:36:13,020
The other thing that a point out is that this is already though, the model of having a game

2724
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:18,380
and then bringing out a movie iteration of it was already successful in Japan.

2725
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:20,380
I mean, most of the time it was animated.

2726
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:22,700
I mean, how did they finish Danganronpa?

2727
02:36:22,700 --> 02:36:23,660
They did an anime.

2728
02:36:24,220 --> 02:36:32,300
You know, there were various live action versions of movies.

2729
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:35,260
There was a Galgo 13 movie based off of a manga.

2730
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:37,420
There were games based off of.

2731
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:38,940
There were so many different things.

2732
02:36:38,940 --> 02:36:44,220
And then over here, we're finally starting to get why it works.

2733
02:36:44,220 --> 02:36:50,300
But of course, like we always do here and I say we collectively, we shove it down your

2734
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,500
throat until you're sick of it.

2735
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:55,580
You know, just milk it, milk it, milk it, milk it.

2736
02:36:55,580 --> 02:36:58,860
Pixie, you ask a great question that honestly could probably do a whole three hour show

2737
02:36:58,860 --> 02:36:59,820
on by itself.

2738
02:36:59,820 --> 02:37:03,420
But I think I've taken a lot of time on this one for you guys who are all good.

2739
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:07,260
And but I think what's interesting, too, you know, we talk about, you know, the people

2740
02:37:07,260 --> 02:37:08,860
that see the movies that come to our community.

2741
02:37:08,860 --> 02:37:12,220
I think we have to remember and I think I'm really preaching to the choir here.

2742
02:37:12,220 --> 02:37:14,780
I don't think anyone listening to this program needs to hear it.

2743
02:37:14,780 --> 02:37:17,020
But I think this is a message we need to enforce.

2744
02:37:17,020 --> 02:37:21,420
And as many of us are content creators now and have our own communities, this is something

2745
02:37:21,420 --> 02:37:23,100
to reinforce in our own communities.

2746
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:27,340
And that is the notion that gaming is for everyone.

2747
02:37:27,340 --> 02:37:32,060
And we shouldn't keep gaming because there is nothing to gain from that.

2748
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:37,100
The diversity, the various viewpoints, the different opinions, they make gaming and they

2749
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:39,180
make this industry better.

2750
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:41,820
And they've continued to make this gaming industry better.

2751
02:37:41,820 --> 02:37:44,140
And they've elevated this as an art form.

2752
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:50,140
So, you know, if you find somebody out there that is like, hey, I saw The Witcher movie

2753
02:37:50,140 --> 02:37:53,340
or sorry, excuse me, I saw The Witcher Netflix series, and it made me want to play The Witcher

2754
02:37:53,340 --> 02:37:53,820
game.

2755
02:37:53,820 --> 02:37:55,820
And now I'm asking for help on this forum.

2756
02:37:56,460 --> 02:37:57,900
Be nice to this person.

2757
02:37:57,900 --> 02:38:01,420
They're discovering this awesome game that maybe you knew a long time ago.

2758
02:38:01,420 --> 02:38:03,820
But again, I know none of you need to hear it.

2759
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:09,340
But I think this is just those like tenants that we need to make sure that the cool people

2760
02:38:09,340 --> 02:38:10,700
in gaming are doing this.

2761
02:38:11,580 --> 02:38:12,780
We don't need gatekeepers.

2762
02:38:12,780 --> 02:38:14,060
The gates are open.

2763
02:38:14,060 --> 02:38:14,620
Exactly.

2764
02:38:14,620 --> 02:38:16,460
The gates have been open for such a long time.

2765
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:21,020
And I don't want this to turn into like, the D&D thing where they got super mad that new

2766
02:38:21,020 --> 02:38:22,220
people were showing up.

2767
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:24,460
Yeah, because it should be for everyone.

2768
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:26,380
We are all gamers together.

2769
02:38:26,380 --> 02:38:27,100
Exactly.

2770
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:28,380
They were newbies once too.

2771
02:38:29,740 --> 02:38:35,260
We all we all didn't loop our killer the first time we all bit dust.

2772
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:38,620
We couldn't aim the first time we picked up a first person shooter.

2773
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:41,820
So why bash on people learning and we're not safe.

2774
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:44,860
That's even threw up the first time we played a first person game.

2775
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:47,900
To go back to how people would try to discredit Dungeons and Dragons.

2776
02:38:47,900 --> 02:38:51,580
We're not Satan worshippers because that was a narrative they would put out there too.

2777
02:38:51,580 --> 02:38:55,420
And I used to tell my grandmother, I'm going out to sacrifice chickens.

2778
02:38:55,420 --> 02:38:55,820
Bye.

2779
02:38:55,820 --> 02:38:56,460
But guess what?

2780
02:38:56,460 --> 02:38:56,960
Guess what?

2781
02:38:57,580 --> 02:39:02,060
Instead of saying Satan worshippers, they say contributes to gun violence.

2782
02:39:02,700 --> 02:39:03,260
That's yep.

2783
02:39:03,260 --> 02:39:06,060
That is the Satan worshippers narrative under a different name.

2784
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:08,060
Food for thought.

2785
02:39:09,260 --> 02:39:09,760
Yeah.

2786
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:11,500
All right, Fixie.

2787
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:12,300
I love the call.

2788
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:13,020
Thank you so much.

2789
02:39:13,020 --> 02:39:16,700
I hope folks consider giving you a follow on the Twitch.

2790
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:20,700
I'm sure you will be seen again on Dark Soccer's channel a little bit later.

2791
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:21,900
At some point.

2792
02:39:21,900 --> 02:39:22,220
Oh, yeah.

2793
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:23,580
Not tonight, then another night.

2794
02:39:23,580 --> 02:39:24,080
So.

2795
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:26,380
And we may have a Jay.

2796
02:39:26,380 --> 02:39:27,100
Ooh, fun fun.

2797
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:28,220
We may have a Shay.

2798
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:28,700
All right.

2799
02:39:28,700 --> 02:39:29,900
Love you guys so much.

2800
02:39:30,620 --> 02:39:32,940
And happy birthday, Orange Lounge Radio.

2801
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:33,260
Thanks.

2802
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:34,060
I appreciate it.

2803
02:39:34,060 --> 02:39:34,700
Thank you for that.

2804
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:36,060
We're gonna go do shots.

2805
02:39:36,060 --> 02:39:36,460
All right.

2806
02:39:36,460 --> 02:39:37,340
Take care, Fixie.

2807
02:39:37,340 --> 02:39:38,300
Yell yeah.

2808
02:39:38,300 --> 02:39:38,800
Bye.

2809
02:39:39,500 --> 02:39:39,740
All right.

2810
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:42,620
Let's bring in one more caller here.

2811
02:39:42,700 --> 02:39:43,820
Who would like to call in?

2812
02:39:43,820 --> 02:39:46,060
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2813
02:39:46,060 --> 02:39:46,940
Who's this?

2814
02:39:50,220 --> 02:39:52,780
It would help if I would unmute my own damn microphone.

2815
02:39:52,780 --> 02:39:53,260
It might.

2816
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:55,100
Hey, Rama.

2817
02:39:55,100 --> 02:39:55,980
It's good to see you.

2818
02:39:55,980 --> 02:39:56,540
How are you?

2819
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:59,020
Well, I'm good.

2820
02:39:59,020 --> 02:39:59,820
A little tired.

2821
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:02,940
It's been quite interesting weekend, but you know how we do, you know.

2822
02:40:02,940 --> 02:40:03,340
Uh huh.

2823
02:40:03,340 --> 02:40:03,840
Uh huh.

2824
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:05,420
What's on your mind?

2825
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:09,980
Sorry, I don't have the way to juggle the cameras on the fly real quick for the four

2826
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:10,300
shots.

2827
02:40:10,300 --> 02:40:10,780
So sorry.

2828
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:14,140
Dark Soccer's Pig Meg will be off screen for just a moment while we talk to our buddy,

2829
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:15,180
DJ Rama S.

2830
02:40:15,180 --> 02:40:16,620
But what's on your mind tonight?

2831
02:40:17,580 --> 02:40:22,780
Rama, somebody who does this with Skype on a regular, I understand.

2832
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:25,980
Yeah, there's only so much I can do live.

2833
02:40:25,980 --> 02:40:27,420
So what's on your mind tonight?

2834
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:33,580
A couple of things, but there's something we have to do first before anything else.

2835
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:36,220
I was hoping it was this.

2836
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:37,180
I know where you're going.

2837
02:40:37,900 --> 02:40:40,300
Orange Lounge Radio turned 21.

2838
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:41,020
We did.

2839
02:40:41,020 --> 02:40:42,300
We're old enough to drink.

2840
02:40:43,180 --> 02:40:50,140
Well, that's why I have this big old container here that's equivalent to three smaller containers.

2841
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:52,700
By the way, did you see that video of yourself earlier?

2842
02:40:52,700 --> 02:40:54,220
DJ Rama S with no gray hairs?

2843
02:40:55,340 --> 02:40:56,620
Yes, yes.

2844
02:40:57,420 --> 02:41:01,100
The young DJ Rama S Chronicles coming soon to Paramount Plus.

2845
02:41:01,740 --> 02:41:03,500
No, Paramount Plus has canceled everything.

2846
02:41:03,500 --> 02:41:04,140
I'm sorry to say.

2847
02:41:04,780 --> 02:41:06,220
Maybe you can get a deal with Pluto.

2848
02:41:07,900 --> 02:41:10,860
Well, they're owned by Paramount, so maybe.

2849
02:41:10,860 --> 02:41:11,360
Maybe.

2850
02:41:13,180 --> 02:41:18,300
I want to say there is an extended version of us dancing in the background.

2851
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:23,340
It is a part of the caramel dancing sim file, part of Orange Lounge Revolution.

2852
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:23,820
I remember.

2853
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:26,540
See, I was trying to find that in the clip because I swear that was the thing.

2854
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:30,700
But anyway, anyway, please, please do your birthday tribute if you wouldn't mind.

2855
02:41:30,700 --> 02:41:35,260
And I just want to stress for the viewers at home under the new Twitch guidelines and everything.

2856
02:41:35,260 --> 02:41:41,420
Of course, that is just simply Kool-Aid that is in that glass that DJ Rama S is holding.

2857
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:43,660
Yes, of course.

2858
02:41:43,660 --> 02:41:44,540
It is Kool-Aid.

2859
02:41:45,820 --> 02:41:48,140
Kool-Aid for cool kids.

2860
02:41:48,140 --> 02:41:50,140
Yes, cool kids and mature people.

2861
02:41:50,140 --> 02:41:50,860
That's right.

2862
02:41:50,860 --> 02:41:52,940
Happy birthday to one and all.

2863
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:55,020
Now, hopefully we'll see you all next year.

2864
02:41:56,060 --> 02:41:56,860
I hope so, too.

2865
02:41:57,740 --> 02:42:01,820
I hope you're enjoying your distilled wheat juice.

2866
02:42:02,780 --> 02:42:03,420
Absolutely.

2867
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:05,820
I have something to wash it down with as well.

2868
02:42:05,820 --> 02:42:11,580
So which I think that label said Diet Coke, if I read that correctly.

2869
02:42:11,580 --> 02:42:14,060
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2870
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:17,100
In a brand in a new limited edition silver can with with.

2871
02:42:17,100 --> 02:42:20,060
Oh, that's the video is getting choppy.

2872
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:20,940
I can't really see that.

2873
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:22,620
Anyway, what's on your mind today, Rama?

2874
02:42:23,340 --> 02:42:26,620
Apologies is probably my machine because my machine is wrong.

2875
02:42:26,620 --> 02:42:27,420
I'm fucking with you.

2876
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:30,620
Damn it, Rob.

2877
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:33,260
See, I even wore our favorite shirt.

2878
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:33,740
I know.

2879
02:42:33,740 --> 02:42:38,620
I was going to say the last time I saw you in person, I have an amazing picture of you

2880
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:39,980
that's floating around Facebook.

2881
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:41,340
That's you.

2882
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:43,740
No, it's you eating a piece of cheesecake wearing that shirt.

2883
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:45,020
It's one of my favorite pictures of you.

2884
02:42:45,020 --> 02:42:49,020
I've seen this when we were at one of those diners off Broadway.

2885
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:53,180
Yes, we have to do that again.

2886
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:53,740
We have.

2887
02:42:53,740 --> 02:42:55,340
I know we want to come back out.

2888
02:42:55,340 --> 02:42:56,380
Victoria does.

2889
02:42:56,380 --> 02:42:57,740
Melody would always be down.

2890
02:42:57,740 --> 02:43:01,660
It's just it's just a matter of when and money and time, et cetera.

2891
02:43:03,500 --> 02:43:08,300
Believe you me, I know now there's a couple of things that came up during the show.

2892
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:14,780
But I want to touch base on now the whole Activision Blizzard King thing and Microsoft

2893
02:43:14,780 --> 02:43:17,580
saying, oh, we're throwing in the towel.

2894
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:21,340
Everybody's laughing at Microsoft saying you couldn't hack it.

2895
02:43:21,340 --> 02:43:22,540
You couldn't handle it.

2896
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:28,300
But that's how they're going to end up getting a BK because Microsoft says we're not the

2897
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:30,940
number one Sony and Microsoft.

2898
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:33,900
I mean, Sony and Nintendo is they've been kicking our butts.

2899
02:43:33,900 --> 02:43:37,500
So all we're trying to do is step our game up.

2900
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:38,860
And that's how they're going to do it.

2901
02:43:38,860 --> 02:43:39,100
Yeah.

2902
02:43:39,100 --> 02:43:42,380
No, being coming off as the humble.

2903
02:43:42,380 --> 02:43:44,140
We're just trying to do our own thing here.

2904
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:49,500
That's that's absolutely the narrative they want, because that's going to make it more

2905
02:43:49,500 --> 02:43:52,060
attractive, like, oh, what harm is it going to be if they get Activision?

2906
02:43:52,140 --> 02:43:53,420
They're not the biggest one in the room.

2907
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:58,220
That's why Sony is trying to discredit Nintendo as a player in the same game, because

2908
02:43:58,220 --> 02:44:00,700
Nintendo, as we know, doesn't make expensive toys.

2909
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:01,980
They just make fun toys.

2910
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:03,100
Yeah.

2911
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:07,340
So what Sony is the president where he's been flipping back and forth?

2912
02:44:07,340 --> 02:44:08,780
I hate to say it.

2913
02:44:08,780 --> 02:44:16,140
It's his ignorance is going to help be like basically the missing link from Microsoft

2914
02:44:16,140 --> 02:44:16,940
to win this.

2915
02:44:16,940 --> 02:44:18,140
That's the way I look at it.

2916
02:44:18,140 --> 02:44:21,180
Yeah, it's it's going to be interesting how this all plays out.

2917
02:44:21,180 --> 02:44:28,220
But, you know, we've been surprised in this before, so we can't assume anything is science

2918
02:44:28,220 --> 02:44:29,260
you'll deliver just yet.

2919
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:33,100
And one more thing I want to touch base on.

2920
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:35,020
I don't fully remember the full conversation.

2921
02:44:35,020 --> 02:44:39,420
I was running back and forth, you know, doing adult stuff, you know, you know, you know,

2922
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:40,860
happens when you have to be an adult.

2923
02:44:40,860 --> 02:44:47,180
But you have mentioned about how you this PS five has become like your dominant console

2924
02:44:47,180 --> 02:44:51,420
and you move to Xbox downstairs as entertainment console and so forth.

2925
02:44:53,340 --> 02:44:57,900
My brother in Christ, I feel you on this right now.

2926
02:44:57,900 --> 02:45:00,140
My primary system is my Xbox.

2927
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:01,500
Watch all of my stuff.

2928
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:02,620
Play all of my games.

2929
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:11,740
I haven't touched my PlayStation four in about six months, and I just re-upped my PlayStation

2930
02:45:11,740 --> 02:45:13,660
plus because I got it dirt cheap.

2931
02:45:13,660 --> 02:45:18,940
I have a stack of PlayStation games sitting back there, sealed, waiting to go.

2932
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:25,340
And if I'm not on my console, I'm at this PC, you know, playing some games.

2933
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:29,500
And I understand people are talking about how, you know, with game pass and the fact

2934
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:35,580
that every Xbox game is going to be on the console and on the PC, you don't need an Xbox.

2935
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:38,060
I'm like, I look at it this way.

2936
02:45:38,060 --> 02:45:50,860
I can either play, oh, halo at my PC, which is very powerful on my 27 inch, 2K screen

2937
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:53,420
or and my computer chip.

2938
02:45:53,420 --> 02:46:00,860
Or I can go to the comfort of my bed and relax, play Halo on my 43 inch 4K screen.

2939
02:46:01,980 --> 02:46:04,860
And that's something some people do not understand.

2940
02:46:04,860 --> 02:46:07,420
Yes, I have a high powered gaming desktop.

2941
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:14,140
The most powerful game that I play on here is Phantasy Star Online.

2942
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:21,580
If it's not for that, the power behind the system is for multimedia, which some people

2943
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:22,860
tend to forget.

2944
02:46:23,500 --> 02:46:29,100
So, you know, and it just it you bring up a good point that the right machine is really

2945
02:46:29,100 --> 02:46:34,780
dependent on, you know, let's not forget the series S, you know, in the conversation, that

2946
02:46:34,780 --> 02:46:39,980
is the right choice for gamers that are either on a budget or maybe just don't need the power

2947
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:43,820
or don't have a 4K TV, which is still the case in some homes and so forth.

2948
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:46,700
You know, they just that's what fits their needs right now.

2949
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:50,140
It's just you get the setup that works for you.

2950
02:46:50,140 --> 02:46:54,860
And that's the importance of, you know, when Xbox and Microsoft talks about an ecosystem

2951
02:46:54,860 --> 02:46:59,260
and a gaming ecosystem, that's where they want to lead is, you know, have that system

2952
02:46:59,260 --> 02:47:02,620
through the cloud, through the series consoles, through the PC.

2953
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:05,740
That's the game that Microsoft really wants to play.

2954
02:47:05,740 --> 02:47:08,460
And the game pass connects all of those things together.

2955
02:47:09,260 --> 02:47:16,060
And that's why no matter what, there will always be an Xbox system, whereas there will

2956
02:47:16,060 --> 02:47:18,220
always be a Microsoft Surface.

2957
02:47:18,220 --> 02:47:24,380
The Surface is there to show what Microsoft Windows can do in any type of environment,

2958
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:28,220
whereas the Xbox always be here to show what Game Pass can do.

2959
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:32,860
And honestly, I've seen tech YouTubers do this left and right.

2960
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:39,500
They try to build a $500 PC that's just as potent as the Xbox.

2961
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:46,780
The way things are now, honestly, just go get a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X and

2962
02:47:46,780 --> 02:47:47,980
call it a day.

2963
02:47:47,980 --> 02:47:48,620
All right.

2964
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:51,820
I have already dropped $250 on memory.

2965
02:47:51,820 --> 02:48:00,780
I have dropped over $250 more on a brand new power supply and a brand new all in one

2966
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:01,260
cooler.

2967
02:48:01,260 --> 02:48:04,540
I already dropped $400 on an RTX card.

2968
02:48:05,500 --> 02:48:09,180
I'm just saying just go with where it's good.

2969
02:48:09,180 --> 02:48:09,740
I get it.

2970
02:48:09,740 --> 02:48:10,620
I get it.

2971
02:48:10,620 --> 02:48:10,940
All right.

2972
02:48:10,940 --> 02:48:13,260
Well, Rama, it's after midnight on the East Coast.

2973
02:48:13,260 --> 02:48:14,140
We got to wrap up here.

2974
02:48:14,140 --> 02:48:15,740
We've had a long show tonight.

2975
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:17,980
Do you have a final thought for our folks tonight before I let you go?

2976
02:48:17,980 --> 02:48:22,620
If you get the opportunity, go to Japan.

2977
02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:23,500
That's all I got to say.

2978
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:24,700
I wish I'd love to.

2979
02:48:25,580 --> 02:48:26,540
I'm going.

2980
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:33,180
I'm taking my passport appointment is Wednesday, and it's a done deal.

2981
02:48:33,180 --> 02:48:33,820
It's a done deal.

2982
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:35,020
I'm going in December.

2983
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:36,540
I'd love to meet you there.

2984
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:37,340
I wish I could.

2985
02:48:37,340 --> 02:48:37,840
All right.

2986
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:43,900
I'm getting the big enough suitcase, so I will see if I can have a layover in Sac

2987
02:48:43,900 --> 02:48:44,220
town.

2988
02:48:44,220 --> 02:48:45,100
You know, I got you.

2989
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:45,500
All right.

2990
02:48:45,500 --> 02:48:45,900
All right.

2991
02:48:46,380 --> 02:48:49,260
Even if you have a layover in SF, that's not that far away.

2992
02:48:49,260 --> 02:48:49,820
You know that.

2993
02:48:49,820 --> 02:48:51,420
So let me know.

2994
02:48:52,300 --> 02:48:53,260
Most definitely.

2995
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:53,900
I got you.

2996
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:54,220
All right.

2997
02:48:54,220 --> 02:48:54,780
Love it.

2998
02:48:54,780 --> 02:48:55,340
All right.

2999
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:56,540
Take care, Rama.

3000
02:48:56,540 --> 02:48:57,020
Thanks.

3001
02:48:57,020 --> 02:48:58,220
Thanks for the Kool Aid shot.

3002
02:48:58,220 --> 02:48:58,620
Take care.

3003
02:48:59,340 --> 02:48:59,820
All right.

3004
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:00,300
Later.

3005
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:00,800
Bye.

3006
02:49:01,900 --> 02:49:02,540
All right.

3007
02:49:02,540 --> 02:49:04,300
That was lovely.

3008
02:49:04,300 --> 02:49:07,260
DJ, thank you so much for giving us a call.

3009
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:10,220
That is going to do it, though, for the almost said the Skype line.

3010
02:49:10,220 --> 02:49:10,940
You know, I've been doing it.

3011
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:13,660
He brought up Skype during that call, and now my brain's like, oh, that's going to close

3012
02:49:13,660 --> 02:49:13,740
it.

3013
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:19,100
That's going to close up Discord for tonight as we are here to wrap up here.

3014
02:49:19,100 --> 02:49:21,580
Real quick, Loki, last minute stories we want to put out there.

3015
02:49:22,380 --> 02:49:24,060
Yeah, just had one small thing.

3016
02:49:24,060 --> 02:49:28,140
So apparently it's like this just happened not that long ago, either.

3017
02:49:29,980 --> 02:49:37,100
There was a trailer for a I think it's for the new Destiny expansion, and it featured

3018
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:39,420
someone else's fan art in there.

3019
02:49:40,220 --> 02:49:40,720
Whoops.

3020
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:41,380
Jeez.

3021
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:47,920
And so apparently, thankfully, the artist that made it was just like, well, that's cool,

3022
02:49:47,920 --> 02:49:55,200
you know, but Bungee said that we discovered that an internal or external vendor that helped

3023
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:57,120
create this cut scene mistakenly.

3024
02:49:57,120 --> 02:49:57,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

3025
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:59,040
It was in game is during a cut scene.

3026
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:03,840
OK, so mistakenly used this art as reference, assuming it was official bungee artwork.

3027
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:08,000
We are currently waiting to hear back from the artists to take necessary steps to remedy

3028
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:08,720
the situation.

3029
02:50:09,680 --> 02:50:13,920
Good, so they're planning to compensate and credit them for their work and pay them in

3030
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:17,760
like actual government currency artists what they're worth.

3031
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:23,760
Yeah, not like in-game currencies, give them actual government legal tender currency.

3032
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:24,820
All right.

3033
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:30,640
Thank you all so much for downloading or listening to us live tonight on Twitch and so forth.

3034
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:33,840
I just, you know, again, thank you for taking time out of your week, out of your Sunday

3035
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:36,400
night to be here and participate along with the show.

3036
02:50:36,400 --> 02:50:37,680
We really appreciate you.

3037
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:40,160
We wouldn't be here for 21 years if it wasn't for all of you.

3038
02:50:40,160 --> 02:50:41,840
And we just we really appreciate all of you.

3039
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:44,560
Thank you so much for helping to make Orange Launch Radio possible.

3040
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:48,480
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, help us spread the spread the word.

3041
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:49,280
Tell a friend or two.

3042
02:50:49,280 --> 02:50:53,680
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify or wherever you found this show goes

3043
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:54,960
an awful long way as well.

3044
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:59,280
Support all of our personal endeavors as well.

3045
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:02,080
We all of us either Twitch or YouTube or maybe even both.

3046
02:51:02,800 --> 02:51:07,520
So we really appreciate that as well if you consider taking that extra step as well.

3047
02:51:08,480 --> 02:51:10,720
That is going to do it for Orange Launch Radio tonight.

3048
02:51:10,720 --> 02:51:14,880
We'll be back in seven days, of course, to start off, I guess, what would technically

3049
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:17,120
be our 22nd year in a way.

3050
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:19,600
But yeah, it's a wild, wild.

3051
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:21,680
Let's go around.

3052
02:51:22,480 --> 02:51:24,000
Why does this still say DJ Roma S?

3053
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:25,840
See, this is why I shouldn't change shots on the fly.

3054
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:27,040
It still says DJ Roma S down there.

3055
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:29,040
Should we say Dark Sakura?

3056
02:51:29,040 --> 02:51:32,400
So if I could type.

3057
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:33,680
So Dark Sakura, we'll go to you.

3058
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:35,360
My audio is going funky all of a sudden.

3059
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:35,860
Who knew?

3060
02:51:36,260 --> 02:51:40,420
Well, before we lose you, then let's get your final thought for the night.

3061
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:46,180
My final thought is stop camping, stop tunneling, learn how to play the fucking game.

3062
02:51:47,780 --> 02:51:49,380
And bring tiramisu.

3063
02:51:49,380 --> 02:51:50,900
It's the anniversary event after all.

3064
02:51:50,900 --> 02:51:52,020
Tiramisu.

3065
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:54,180
I love that it's tiramisu.

3066
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:55,460
It's great.

3067
02:51:55,460 --> 02:51:56,740
That just made me giddy.

3068
02:51:56,740 --> 02:52:01,780
Well, tiramisu is my favorite, my favorite dessert.

3069
02:52:01,780 --> 02:52:02,500
It's a good dessert.

3070
02:52:03,380 --> 02:52:04,100
All right.

3071
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:05,460
Have fun with some Dead by Daylight.

3072
02:52:05,460 --> 02:52:06,340
I know you're off to go play.

3073
02:52:06,980 --> 02:52:08,180
I'll stay fog.

3074
02:52:08,180 --> 02:52:08,500
All right.

3075
02:52:08,500 --> 02:52:09,000
Bye.

3076
02:52:10,100 --> 02:52:11,300
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3077
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:17,380
I'm just going to keep grinding my craft and hopefully we'll have some progress shots of

3078
02:52:17,380 --> 02:52:18,100
wooden pinball.

3079
02:52:19,380 --> 02:52:19,780
All right.

3080
02:52:19,780 --> 02:52:20,340
Sounds good.

3081
02:52:21,380 --> 02:52:21,860
Let's see.

3082
02:52:21,860 --> 02:52:27,300
My final thought for the night is I'm going to do, I'm doing this very last minute, but

3083
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:29,460
tomorrow happens to be my actual birthday.

3084
02:52:29,460 --> 02:52:32,900
I don't want to make a big, big deal out of it, but I'm going to do a little bit of a

3085
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:33,780
birthday stream.

3086
02:52:33,780 --> 02:52:38,020
I'm not going to beg for subs or anything like that, which I understand is I just want,

3087
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:39,300
I honestly, I just want growth.

3088
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:40,180
I want more followers.

3089
02:52:40,180 --> 02:52:42,260
I want, I want, you can pay me an exposure.

3090
02:52:42,260 --> 02:52:42,760
It's okay.

3091
02:52:43,780 --> 02:52:45,860
So I'm going to do just an impromptu birthday stream.

3092
02:52:45,860 --> 02:52:47,460
I'm not going to play 16.

3093
02:52:47,460 --> 02:52:50,900
I'm going to play games that don't have a heavy narrative tomorrow.

3094
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:53,940
And I'm just going to cycle through some of the greatest hits that I've streamed over

3095
02:52:53,940 --> 02:52:54,580
the last year.

3096
02:52:54,580 --> 02:53:00,420
Things like Dead by Daylight, things, Diablo 4, No Man's Sky, Final Fantasy 14 Endgame

3097
02:53:00,420 --> 02:53:01,860
where there's no story.

3098
02:53:01,860 --> 02:53:04,820
And I'm just going to cycle through and try to do a really long stream tomorrow night.

3099
02:53:04,820 --> 02:53:07,220
So I can spend my birthday with y'all because what else am I going to do with a birthday

3100
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:07,780
on a Monday?

3101
02:53:08,420 --> 02:53:10,660
So I hope you'll stop by and say hello.

3102
02:53:11,700 --> 02:53:12,740
That's, that's it.

3103
02:53:12,740 --> 02:53:15,060
Twitch.tv slash Rob Roberts, if you want to do that.

3104
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:19,620
Otherwise, that's it for me as well.

3105
02:53:20,420 --> 02:53:21,860
So that does it for Final Thoughts.

3106
02:53:21,860 --> 02:53:23,300
That does it for the show.

3107
02:53:23,300 --> 02:53:27,460
Thanks again for being here and making it a fantastic 21 years.

3108
02:53:27,460 --> 02:53:28,900
Shall we go for 21 more?

3109
02:53:31,060 --> 02:53:31,620
Baby steps.

3110
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:31,940
All right.

3111
02:53:32,820 --> 02:53:35,700
No, in all seriousness, we will definitely see you again in seven days.

3112
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:36,740
Have a good week, everybody.

3113
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:37,620
We'll see you next time.

3114
02:53:37,620 --> 02:53:38,660
Happy gaming.

3115
02:53:38,660 --> 02:53:42,260
And remember, please, please, gaming is for everyone.

3116
02:53:42,260 --> 02:53:43,220
And don't you forget it.

3117
02:53:43,220 --> 02:53:44,020
Have a great night.

3118
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:44,520
Bye.
