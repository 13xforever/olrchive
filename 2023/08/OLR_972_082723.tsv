0	15160	Finally, Sony has come back to the mobile space.
15160	22680	Wi-Fi only, as long as you have a PS5 already, a $200 accessory for a $400 or $500 console.
22680	26840	Hope your home internet is good and the Wi-Fi out wherever you are as well.
26840	27840	Not promising.
27840	30200	I made it back in time not to record in the closet again.
30200	33320	Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about
33320	36280	this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where
36280	37760	every gamer has a voice.
37760	41960	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
41960	46160	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
46160	54240	It is Orange Lounge Radio back and live once again tonight, August the 27th of 2023 with
54240	57840	episode number 972 of our show.
57840	62120	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week joined by my co-hosts.
62120	65680	First off over there, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
65680	66680	Hello.
66680	67680	Hello.
67680	68680	Hello.
68680	69680	How are you doing?
69680	71680	I'm all right.
71680	76660	It's been a very trying week and I have to go right back to it tomorrow.
76660	80520	Would you say based on your background that the last Metroid is in captivity and the galaxy
80520	81520	is at peace?
81520	84400	No, the galaxy is very much at war in my head.
84400	85400	Oh, I'm sorry.
85400	88640	I'm sorry to hear that, but I hope we can have a fun show tonight to help with some
88640	91640	of the sads or frustrations.
91640	95160	I didn't say anything was sad, it's just long.
95160	97760	And also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
97760	99320	Hey, Loki.
99320	100320	Hello.
100320	103320	And you've had quite the interesting weekend, haven't you?
103320	105200	Yeah, it's been busy.
105200	106200	Yeah.
106200	107200	Busy week.
107200	108200	Hectic week.
108200	110560	You had a lot of prep stuff that was going into this week, didn't it?
110600	111600	Didn't you?
111600	112600	There's been a lot.
112600	113600	Yeah.
113600	114600	Yeah.
114600	119760	So you participated in this very large competition in the Minecraft community that we've been
119760	122000	hyping for a couple of weeks here, right?
122000	123000	Yes.
123000	124000	Yes.
124000	126880	MC Championship Rising 2.
126880	128620	So it was fun.
128620	133800	We did it yesterday for like three hours or so and it went by in a flash.
133800	137500	Those three hours just gone.
137500	138600	That's usually how it goes.
139560	145000	I guess the most similar thing I can think of is doing like a live performance like Rocky
145000	146540	Horror Shadowcasting or Clue Shadowcasting.
146540	150880	You put all this work into it and then in two hours, it's done.
150880	151880	It's done with.
151880	155720	But how did things go for you and the team?
155720	156720	It went okay.
156720	158520	That is what I thought it was going to be.
158520	163200	So like, I mean, you have to understand, like, this is a type of a competition that a lot
163200	169280	of it is based off of, like, you know, PvP, parkour, that type of stuff.
169280	174040	There's certainly a lot of creators that that's the kind of their centric type of content
174040	181760	that they make that, you know, it's not so much SMP content and all that, which that's
181760	187040	not to say that I don't I think actually the team at one is a little bit more SMP contents
187040	189000	centric, if I remember correctly.
189000	190680	I don't remember exactly.
190680	195480	But but yeah, I mean, like, I didn't think I was going to come in there all of a sudden
195480	200560	like, yes, in a week, I'm going to become an expert at PvP and parkour like that.
200560	202680	I just knew that that was not going to happen.
202680	205000	So we did okay.
205000	206280	We didn't come in last.
206280	207280	So that was good.
207280	211800	We got ninth ninth place out of ten teams, which is fine.
211800	214800	And we I got thirty fifth overall.
214800	216580	So it was all right.
216580	219800	There's a few opportunities that were kind of frustrating that like I had some pretty
219800	223120	good runs, especially an ace race.
223120	228180	The last lap, I got stuck on something in the last five positions on that.
228180	233440	And like actually the and for those watching live, you can see it playing in the background.
233440	237960	This is actually from the live stream that we did yesterday.
237960	243680	And so there was, you know, some opportunities that, you know, I wish I had done better,
243680	247560	but like, I don't know, it was still fun overall.
247560	249680	Wish we could have played some games that we didn't.
249680	252600	But you know, just the nature of the game.
252600	257720	Oh, so like you only get so oh, I thought it was like an Olympics thing and you played
257720	258720	them all.
258720	259720	You only do you.
259720	261120	Well, you get there's 14.
261120	267080	So this the twist this time was so normally in MCC, they announced nine games and they
267080	270640	play eight of them and one gets skipped in this one.
270640	275800	They announced that all 14 games were going to be available and we'd only play eight of
275800	276800	them.
276800	282920	So they kept introducing a new game every round once a game was picked.
282920	285120	And so we didn't get to play everything.
285120	289000	I wanted to play bingo but fast, but we didn't get to do that.
289000	294540	Instead, we played battle box, which I wish we had skipped that because that's something
294540	296460	that's on MCC Island.
296460	300540	You can play that literally any time for free.
300540	303840	So it's kind of lame that we played it, but whatever.
303840	304840	It's fine.
304840	310060	GP centric teams wanted to play that same with survival games.
310060	312120	There was a funny thing with red.
312120	314760	So like in the way the games are picked.
314760	317600	So there's a thing called the decision dome.
317600	322320	And it's this giant dome that basically it looks like a pie.
322320	324640	And there's a bunch of different slices for each game.
324640	329280	And you have an egg and you throw your chicken into where you want to go.
329280	330620	And well, it's a Minecraft chicken.
330620	334440	It doesn't necessarily want to listen to what you want it to do.
334440	338440	So you can throw the egg and it may just walk somewhere else.
338440	340720	But then there's also modifiers that you can get as well.
340720	345520	So you can you can dunk other teams so that they can't throw their eggs.
345520	352880	You can get a thing where you can fire an arrow and it will put you down there as a
352880	355100	player and you get to knock the chickens around.
355100	359160	And so the red team got that and they did that and they weren't paying attention to
359160	362680	where they were knocking the chickens because they were trying to get them to go into bingo
362680	363680	but fast.
363680	367520	But then they accidentally put them all into survival games.
367520	372480	It was a moment like it was funny, though, because because I was like joking about it,
372480	374880	I'm like, oh, you're dead to me.
374880	381040	And you could hear it right when they did that, like, I think I made a mistake.
381040	383280	So that was kind of a funny, funny bit.
383280	388520	OK, so it sounds like in light of the fact that like, OK, you don't have as much PvP
388520	389520	experience.
389520	390520	Oh, sure.
390520	393320	You were never going to get first place in this thing.
393320	396680	And so you ended up with, you know, ninth or whatever, 35th.
396680	400720	Like it really does sound like you had a lot of fun doing it and you have some great fun.
400720	405240	It was got some really good networking and it sounds like to so yeah, yeah.
405240	409520	So like the discord that we were all in, you know, it's going to stick around.
409520	414400	We like already like talking about like, oh, hey, we need to do other things together and
414400	415400	stuff like that.
415400	417800	Yeah, that'd be fun.
417800	418800	So important.
418800	419800	Yeah.
419800	420800	So hopefully we get to do that.
420800	422240	That would be great.
422240	423720	So everyone's been really positive.
423720	424720	I mean, sure.
424720	426160	You want to do better, obviously.
426160	427160	And there's like parts.
427160	431440	It's like, say, oh, man, like, I really wish, you know, I'd done better here or I didn't
431440	432440	do that.
432440	433440	Yeah.
433440	434440	Yeah.
434440	436640	So you're just I'm just going to do that to myself because that's just what happens.
436640	441000	And really, it's not so much that like I cared about like winning or anything.
441000	443380	It's more of the attention to the channel.
443380	448040	So like, I get it like beforehand already.
448040	449420	People don't know who I am.
449420	451740	And so they're like, oh, this person's an MCZ.
451740	452920	Oh, that's cool.
452920	456580	But then once the game's over, it's like, they don't really care about the teams that
456580	461720	came in like, you know, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, you know, they don't care about them.
461720	464440	They're only concerned about the people who want good sports.
464440	468500	It's basically sports for, you know, Minecraft reality TV show.
468500	469500	Yeah.
470220	475040	So people that like, you know, that are like, oh, they train to like, guess who's going
475040	479220	to win and and like care, really care about the stats and stuff like that.
479220	481620	They're only going to be concerned about those top teams.
481620	485620	And so then once again, it's just like, you know, here I'm in this space again, even though
485620	490660	this is like a really prestigious thing, nobody is going to see my stuff like it's just back
490660	493180	into the same thing against the struggle that you're in.
493180	496300	But I mean, like, it's fine.
496300	497300	It is what it is.
497300	500780	We got like, I still got like 70 new subscribers.
500780	503260	So I mean, that's something and then it's not nothing.
503260	507140	It's yeah, the networking, it's, it's still going to be great for you.
507140	511740	It's you know, you know, just because you didn't win American Idol doesn't mean you
511740	515900	can't, you know, in the future be, you know, a Jennifer Hudson, it just takes a lot of
515900	516900	work.
516900	517900	Exactly.
517900	522500	But yeah, I'm just I'm laughing in my head now.
522500	526740	I said reality show because I'm like, you were on like a gaming reality show this weekend.
526740	527740	Really you were on the tinder.
527740	529780	Yeah, you're on the tester and you didn't win.
529780	530780	I'm sorry to say.
530780	531940	I mean, it's fine.
531940	536300	I knew we we knew we weren't gonna win and the team that won was really awesome.
536300	537620	Like they were all really awesome.
537620	541860	But like the in particular, the one that won, I think is very deserving because they were
541860	544560	like kind of underdogs as well.
544560	548720	And they really put in the work to like get better winning.
548720	553620	Is it just like all that famous fortune like you were talking about before in Minecraft
553620	554620	coins fortune?
554620	558700	Well, they get they get a commemorative coin shipped to them.
558700	560980	So they get that.
560980	564620	And I think the opportunity to be in the Canon events as well.
564620	569540	I'm not sure if it's like a given in it's not even necessarily everybody that wins,
569540	573660	but like some people that participate in it, you have an opportunity to maybe be invited
573660	579020	back or like maybe you get your name in there because I know like Jojo was one that she
579020	582220	was in the first MCC and their team won.
582220	583900	And she's now a Canon player as well.
583900	587540	In fact, she was one of the trainers that was in rising two.
587540	591200	So if there's some people that will go through that process, I mean, they're certainly they're
591200	594940	not always inviting necessarily new people all the time.
594940	600900	And it wasn't necessarily all small creators like Yogscast was in there, which they're
600900	604620	like super old in the Minecraft community.
604620	605740	They've been around forever.
605740	610600	So and that's like a group of like 30 some people I don't remember, but like four of
610600	611600	them were there.
611600	615160	Speaking of old, were you the oldest one in the competition?
615160	620140	I was not and the reason for that is because OK, so here's here's what happened.
620140	622440	So there was some drama during the week.
622440	629200	So originally I was going to be the oldest person playing, but the Aqua Aqua team, I
629200	631560	think it was Aqua team.
631560	639640	They had a player that I don't want to go into details, but basically she had some IRL
639640	646300	stuff that was not kosher that she was doing, interacting with fans and whatnot.
646300	652960	And so they dropped the team, found out about it, her teammates found out about it and brought
652960	658480	it to knock screw the folks running and said, listen, we don't feel right participating
658480	661560	because of this, you know, ridiculous.
661560	668660	So so they they said we would like to be subbed out or, you know, we it's not we don't want
668660	670080	to give this person a platform.
670080	676500	So they decided to drop out, which is very admirable.
676500	679500	Just inappropriate conversations with underage.
679500	684620	Oh, well, then, yeah, then that's like showing her boobs or something.
684620	685880	No, no, no, no, no.
685880	686880	It's nothing like that.
686880	691060	It was no, it's more of she's young, but like, I don't want to go into it, but I don't even
691060	692060	know the details.
692060	693060	It doesn't matter.
693060	695060	Stay out of the drama deep end.
695060	696060	Yeah.
696060	701180	No, but I wanted to know if it was something I wouldn't get.
701180	704620	No, no, no, no, absolutely.
704620	711500	So instead, so the new team got subbed in and that the guy in there, Richard, who's
711500	714980	a guy from Australia, I think, and he makes music and whatnot.
714980	715980	He's slightly older than me.
715980	716980	He's 43.
716980	719900	So like, he is technically now the oldest in there.
719900	721300	I was like the second oldest now.
721300	722300	So that's fine.
722300	723300	That's fine.
723300	725700	And their team did pretty good, too.
725700	726340	They're fun.
726340	731140	I got to play with them quite a bit, like practicing and whatnot.
731140	735340	So yeah, I wasn't the oldest, but no, it was fun.
735340	738020	We got to I got to train.
738020	743720	Well, we had a meeting with Cubfan135 from Hermitcraft.
743720	748580	So he was he decided I got him to coach us one day.
748580	752940	So that was exciting getting to talk to him.
752940	756660	And so now we're we're in touch now.
756660	761300	And he was even in my like, which sucks because my replay right now, my VOD doesn't have the
761300	765360	chat yet because YouTube is slow.
765360	766620	But he was in chat, too.
766620	768540	He like is wishing me good luck and stuff.
768540	770380	So I thought that was just amazing.
770380	773580	It's like died right there.
773580	774580	So yeah, cool.
774580	776500	So I've talked to two hermits now.
776500	779800	So we get to get to see them eventually, all of them.
779800	784540	And that was something that wouldn't have happened if this hadn't all, you know, happened.
784540	789000	So I'm just you know, I know you're you certainly are glad that you did the experience and everything
789000	790000	like that.
790000	791920	But there's lots to win besides the gold medal.
791920	795280	In fact, going to our chat room because I have yet to mention we do tape live every
795280	798760	Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of Geeks Network,
798760	803700	twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although Bobby Black
803700	807860	Wolf did not end up being live tonight, but he will be back in two weeks after Dragon
807860	810160	Khan and looks forward to chatting with you all then.
810160	811900	So he'll be back in two weeks.
811900	813400	And we will not be here next week as well.
813400	816640	But I will tap into that in just a little bit.
816640	821260	But in their chat room as we tape live over twitch.tv slash VOG network, as to 100 Matt
821260	825300	says, the main thing is Loki, you may not have one, but you're part of a much larger
825300	826300	community.
826300	829980	Now, you're getting more and more known, which is a huge step for when you started this journey
829980	830980	a bit ago.
830980	833100	I'm on tier lists now.
833100	834100	That's kind of funny.
834100	840340	Now, granted, like, yeah, I'm on a Minecraft tier list now, Minecraft content creator.
840340	841340	Loki is like this.
841340	842340	It's like this.
842340	848740	Imagine you're on this very large network of independent internet radio stations.
848740	853820	And you get nominated for an award that you're the best one of the year.
853820	857180	And then you actually travel to the ceremony in person.
857180	862620	And then they not only you not only didn't win, but they didn't even read your fucking
862620	868260	name on the envelope until one of your co hosts, the audience said, Hey, so loudly,
868260	874740	it was picked up on the internet broadcast and the person hosting said, Oh, yeah, and
874740	880780	these guys to imagine that and think about what a great thing it is to be part of that
880780	882300	much larger community.
882300	886340	It doesn't matter that we are these people did win.
886340	891140	It matters that we became a part of that community, which fell apart three years later.
892140	893620	I mean, yeah, it's fine.
893620	897420	Like, I think it's funny, though, because like all the like, the tier list stuff that's
897420	901020	been coming out now, it's like most of it's just like, I don't know who this person is.
901020	902340	I'm like, that's fine.
902340	903820	I'm like, I just like being on the tier.
903820	908900	I like that my name and my my thumbnail or my profile pic is on the tier list at all.
908900	912940	So they're still talking about you, whether it's good, whether I've got a wiki page out
912940	913940	on the internet.
913940	916340	Now, I'm on the MCC wiki page now.
916340	920180	So like that, that's the thing now, you know, that that happened.
920220	923620	Does it does it link to the OLR wiki so we can wiki the wiki?
924740	928620	I doesn't, but wiki, wiki whack.
929860	931180	That is wiki, wiki whack.
933140	936380	The most dad joke I've told on this show in like three years.
936660	943940	Oh, gosh, like I Yeah, so like, because I knew it was going to be kind of a struggle like to
943940	946660	like, we weren't gonna be doing well, I was trying to be as entertaining as possible.
946660	952820	So like, I had like prepared bits for, you know, while we played and stuff like that.
952820	954780	I know you did make me proud.
955300	964220	So so like, for example, during Sands of Time, I was sharing facts about sand during Sands of
964220	965220	Time, which is fun.
965620	967780	And it's just a very extra thing to do.
967780	968260	I love it.
968780	970540	And then what else?
970540	979260	Oh, before Ace Race, I was incorrectly quoting Dom from Fast and the Furious, mixing in some of
979260	984580	his quotes and also fast food slogans with that, which I thought was ridiculous.
984580	986020	But I did it anyways.
986580	987660	I don't know, it was fun.
987900	991260	Well, I want to make sure we have time to get into the news tonight and all that good stuff as
991260	991460	well.
991460	995700	But you know, congrats, congrats from all of us here, not just at OLR, but the voice geeks network,
995740	1000500	you know, I know it was a very visible, very high profile thing for you to do.
1000500	1005900	And I'm glad you not only did it, but you you you poured yourself into it.
1005900	1010220	And I hope those kiddos and I can say that because you were almost almost the oldest one of the
1010220	1010580	competition.
1010740	1016300	I hope those kiddos know just how much of yourself you poured into that competition and really,
1016300	1018060	really took it to heart and had fun with it.
1018060	1019620	So congrats.
1020900	1022500	You made us proud, Loki.
1022980	1023700	Thank you.
1023900	1024540	You're welcome.
1024540	1028100	All right, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.
1028100	1029940	There's been a lot going on in the gaming world.
1029980	1035740	Of course, with Gamescom this last weekend, we've had a bit of news come out of that.
1035740	1036900	So we're going to get into that.
1037100	1040940	I will also quickly mention here I know I've been saying it for a few weeks here on the show.
1041500	1047100	We collectively will not be here live next week with Orange Launch Radio as I will be off at
1047100	1051140	Dragon Con with Bobby Blackwell also from the voice geeks network.
1051740	1056060	We actually did a whole little pre special if you want to hear more about Dragon Con in depth.
1056460	1063780	That is over on our YouTube archive over at VOG Network on YouTube and even our first TikTok.
1063780	1068180	We did a minute and a half version of our most looking forward to things for Dragon Con that is
1068180	1071420	available as well over TikTok at VOG Network for the very first time.
1071420	1073180	So very excited for Dragon Con.
1073340	1075660	But that means there will be no show this next weekend.
1076540	1081220	However, Dark Soccer, I know you're going to be doing your thing next Saturday, next Saturday,
1081220	1083820	next Sunday, well, maybe Saturday and Sunday, but next Sunday for sure, right?
1084980	1087460	Yeah, well, I'm back on my regular work schedule.
1087860	1092140	So I will be doing a at least 12 hour subathon.
1093660	1099420	Like, and I'm like, for if I get like a follow, I'll add like a minute.
1099420	1102340	And if I get a sub, I'll add like five minutes or something.
1102340	1104420	So we'll see how long I go.
1104420	1108820	Because since I'll be back on my normal schedule, I will not have to get up early on Monday.
1109460	1113220	So, yeah, I think it would be a fun thing to do anyway.
1113500	1116620	Hopefully with Labor Day weekend, that means more people can tune in, too.
1116620	1120060	Although I might also mean people out of town, but hopefully it all works out.
1120380	1122140	So. All right.
1122780	1125620	Loki, Loki, are you doing anything online next weekend?
1125620	1129220	Are you taking you get to have a nice, quiet night with Mrs.
1129220	1132620	Loki? I may I may try to stream.
1132620	1136660	I don't know. It depends on where I'm at with editing, because I'm still editing my finale,
1136660	1138980	which is taking me three weeks so far.
1139620	1144300	So I made it a point that I don't want to play back on because I did.
1144420	1148420	I mean, without getting into my game week, I did play in our season three server,
1148420	1153260	but I don't want to get too far into it because I don't want to have like two episodes
1153260	1155020	in process at the same time.
1155020	1159340	I want to finish one and then go and start the next one.
1159340	1163140	So I'm forcing myself to edit until it's done.
1163140	1164620	I'm not playing on the server.
1164620	1166860	So hopefully I'll be done by then.
1167140	1169820	And then I will be able to play and then maybe live stream from there.
1169820	1174300	But I do want to live stream more for sure on Twitch
1174660	1179180	instead of YouTube, because the viewership seems to be better there.
1179180	1183420	And originally my plan was because of, you know, YouTube.
1183420	1186140	I thought, you know, it'd be easier for subscribers and stuff.
1186140	1187380	That doesn't seem to be the case.
1187380	1189940	So discoverability seems to be better on Twitch.
1189940	1191020	So we're going to go back there again.
1191020	1193180	Give that a try because we're affiliate anyway.
1193180	1195460	So I mean, why not? Why not?
1195460	1198860	All right. Well, that's all what's going on next weekend.
1198860	1203180	And then OLR, we will collectively be back in two weeks from tonight.
1203420	1205740	And of course, on the podcast feed and all that good stuff as well.
1205940	1209460	That will be Sunday, September 10th that we will be back.
1209460	1211380	No show on September 3rd.
1211380	1215980	OK, let's get into so I mentioned Gamescom happened this week,
1215980	1218020	but there was some news earlier in the week
1218020	1222700	that really had a lot of people kind of taken by surprise and cut.
1222700	1223860	Well, I don't know about surprise,
1223860	1227220	but definitely, definitely a lot of people talking on social this week.
1227940	1230940	Loki, you want to share with us the big news that came down
1230940	1232780	from Nintendo this week?
1232780	1236060	Yeah. So Nintendo basically said that, hey, you know what?
1237060	1239260	I hope you like Chris Pratt do the voice of Mario.
1239620	1240860	That's all they said.
1240860	1244220	But they did say that Charles Martinet has, you know, stepped down
1244220	1248300	from the voice of Mario that, you know, while it's been honored
1248300	1250980	to work with him, you know, he is no longer going to be doing it.
1251060	1253820	Didn't say who else is going to be taking over for Mario, but
1254900	1257100	know that it is not Charles Martinet.
1257100	1261860	That probably also makes sense why the new trailer for the new Mario game
1261860	1264540	didn't quite sound the same.
1264540	1266700	So it's probably a new voice actor.
1266700	1268980	I'd be curious to see who is doing it.
1268980	1271380	I'm actually kind of glad they didn't say who it was going to be,
1271380	1273700	because if they said who it was going to be the same day
1273700	1275820	they announced this news, that person would have gotten bullied.
1275820	1277980	Like, yeah, it sucks.
1277980	1279980	But that's just true facts like that.
1279980	1281300	And it's not like it would happen.
1281300	1283940	I don't think it's that they fired him or anything like that.
1283940	1285420	It's probably his choice.
1285420	1286980	He probably just can't.
1286980	1288500	Maybe he can't do the voice anymore.
1288500	1289540	Just doesn't want to.
1289540	1290500	We don't know.
1290500	1292580	And that's what this all boils down to.
1292580	1293340	We don't know.
1293340	1296460	And we're not going to know because people look, I'll just say people
1296460	1299180	would be quick to bring up that a couple of years ago,
1299180	1302780	Charles Martinet in an interview said, I want I want to do this till I die.
1302780	1304260	Or I would do this until OK.
1304260	1307980	Well, I guess a lot can change in two years.
1308300	1309740	A lot can change in two years.
1309740	1310380	You know what I mean?
1310380	1311260	And we don't know.
1311260	1315700	Like, it's not it's not up for us to pry into his personal life
1315700	1316660	to try to find out.
1316660	1318500	Like, we just know this is what it is.
1318500	1323020	You can kind of infer that based on his new role
1323020	1326460	of being the ambassador or whatever, what did they call it?
1326700	1327540	The Mario Ambassador?
1327540	1331020	He is going to be the Mario ambassador.
1331020	1331540	Yeah.
1331540	1335420	So you can infer through that that relations are still good, right?
1335420	1337220	Because it wasn't.
1337220	1339980	Well, fuck you. I quit then type is not that I would ever think.
1340100	1340940	But it wasn't.
1340940	1344340	I mean, there are certainly people in this world that if they were told
1344340	1346700	you're no longer going to be able to do the voice, they would say, all right,
1346900	1348740	give me give me my last paycheck.
1348740	1350340	I'm fucking out of here type of thing, right?
1350340	1352380	But that's that's not what happened here.
1352380	1356140	So there is a little bit of a, you know, OK, you know, Mr.
1356140	1361180	Martinet is still working with Nintendo in these ambassadorships.
1361420	1365540	It also allows him to continue what is probably his bread and butter
1365540	1369420	of income at this point, which is making appearances at Fan Expo,
1369700	1373940	doing the panels to give his good old hearted wahoos and recording bumpers
1374140	1378340	for podcasts like what on this network and all of that.
1378340	1379420	Like, no shade.
1379420	1382020	That is literally what, you know, he does.
1382020	1384860	And, you know, make some money from those convention appearances
1384860	1386780	and autographs, the selfies and all of that.
1386780	1391060	And it allows him to still carry that official capacity
1391060	1393620	is of Mark because he's the ambassador for Mario or whatever.
1393820	1395020	And still allows him to do that.
1395020	1397700	So it's it's still a nice win situation for him.
1398940	1400500	Tiger Klom chat points out
1400500	1404740	Charles Martinet has been involved in Nintendo projects from 1996 to 2023.
1405020	1408580	I count 2023 because of his role in the Super Mario Brothers movie. Yes.
1408740	1411780	And honestly, and I think we can talk about this now.
1411780	1414700	Now that the Mario Brothers movie is on video, I think if you were going
1414700	1418100	to be worried about spoilers, we're kind of past that point.
1418340	1422500	So I think the fact that he did get to play their dad,
1422620	1427220	which, by the way, I called on this show when they first announced him as a guest.
1427220	1429020	I just want to point that out.
1429020	1432500	I was trying very hard not to spoil it by doing the nana nana nana.
1432500	1435100	I'm right. He also did another voice, right?
1435100	1439060	Wasn't he the guy playing the music in the arcade, playing the arcade machine?
1439220	1441300	I don't remember his name is in there.
1441300	1444500	So but my point is that was a very nice
1444820	1449180	legacy role for him, you know, like like you're Mario's dad.
1449180	1452940	It's like a literal kind of like passing of the baton of swords.
1453220	1454500	And I thought that was really cool.
1454500	1456740	And he did a great job with the roles in the movie.
1456740	1458340	And yeah, so he got to be in the movie.
1458340	1462140	The other Mario and having just done a panel
1462140	1465580	like a month ago with some of the other voice actors and actresses in the game.
1465860	1468020	Unfortunately, none of them were in the movie.
1468020	1472780	So it really goes to show like Charles Martinet and his tie
1472780	1475660	to the franchise and everything, that the fact that, you know,
1475660	1478580	he was able to stand in lockstep with
1479220	1481860	A and B list Hollywood celebrities that made up the rest of the cast.
1482900	1485580	Tyra Conchat says best wishes for the new Mario voice actor.
1485580	1486940	He has big shoes to fill. Yeah.
1486940	1490540	And I, I really feel sorry for this person because the moment it's announced,
1490540	1492500	people are going to hate him from the outset.
1492500	1494620	And I really wish people wouldn't do that.
1494620	1497540	Like this is this is just a decision that's been made.
1497740	1499180	Why did they make the decision though?
1499180	1501780	Here's my here's my honest to God thinking.
1501980	1505300	And people are probably going to take issue with me saying this.
1505300	1507740	I'm sorry, but I'm just I'm going to just say this.
1507740	1509700	It's like I'm telling you like it is.
1510460	1515180	My thought is now that the movie has kind of happened,
1515860	1520260	the wall to Mario doing dialogue has kind of been breached.
1520260	1524300	And the reason why I say kind of is that Captain Lou breached this wall
1524300	1527300	a long time ago and others and not just Captain Lou, but others before.
1527340	1529860	There's been actually many voices of Mario, you know, from.
1529860	1531500	There's also the anime movie.
1531500	1535460	Yeah, anime, the Super Saturday arcade, when Peter Cullen did and all this.
1535460	1537500	There's there's lots of people that have done this.
1537500	1541980	But for many, many years and let's be honest,
1541980	1545020	for most people in their 20s and young 30s,
1545620	1548580	they haven't heard a lot of voice acted Mario beyond the
1548740	1551660	wahoo wahoo in all the stuff that Charles Martinet did.
1552580	1555860	And I think what's happening is that I don't know
1555860	1559580	if it's going to happen in Super Mario Wonder, but in a future Mario game,
1559580	1562420	we're probably getting full Mario voice acting.
1563300	1566020	And they're going to look to that Mario voice acting
1566420	1570540	to line up a little more with what we saw of Mario in the movie.
1571060	1574780	A little bit of the stereotypical Italian accent,
1575180	1581220	but maybe not that full energy, that full 11 the Charles Martinet did,
1581580	1584180	because, you know, a lot of people have suggested that
1584780	1588580	two hours of Charles Martinet doing his high energy Mario
1588860	1591620	probably wouldn't have been as.
1592620	1594980	Wonderful to hear, as people think,
1595620	1598460	and that's no shade to a very hard working man
1598460	1600580	who I really respect a lot in this industry.
1600580	1604100	It's just artistically, is it the right fit?
1604300	1608580	And sometimes we have to admit the answer is no, maybe.
1609180	1611740	So I that's my thought.
1611740	1613820	That's my thought for how this, you know, again,
1613820	1617620	I don't know, I'm just some schmo with a podcast, but my thought is
1618100	1622860	whether it's in Wonder or it's on the successor console to the Nintendo Switch,
1623060	1627020	we're going to get a fully or more fully voice acted Mario game.
1627380	1630060	And they want somebody whose voice is a little more in line
1630060	1632940	with what was in the movie, not Chris Pratt, though.
1633220	1635380	Obviously, he's the guy from Final Fantasy 16.
1635380	1636220	He's too expensive.
1637380	1638660	Now, that was funny.
1638660	1643100	But it got to I can't believe how many websites
1643100	1647940	get their fucking clicks from the voice actor for Clive wants to be the voice
1647940	1650940	of Mario. It was it was a stupid fucking joke.
1651100	1652220	It was a stupid fucking.
1652220	1656420	And I say that in the nicest possible way as somebody who really loves Ben Starr.
1656420	1660780	I mean, really, I really, really have a crush on that guy.
1660780	1663100	He's so hot.
1663580	1668300	I can't listen. Listen, I'm 100 percent straight, but he he's pretty hot.
1668620	1669780	Thank you. Thank you.
1669780	1673060	Like, it's a OK to be a little gay for Ben Starr.
1673060	1675380	Like he or totally gay for it.
1675380	1677420	He's totally, totally worthy of that.
1677420	1683340	So my point is, it's really mind blowing to me how many people are like,
1683900	1685700	oh, he's really going for the voice of Mario.
1685700	1687940	No, he's not. He guess what?
1687940	1690140	He knew it was a tweet that would get retweeted.
1690260	1691580	And he was fucking right.
1691580	1694820	And then he got other voice actors in on it, too.
1694820	1696820	I don't know if he said then other people started.
1696860	1698580	We haven't seen the other ones. No.
1698580	1701500	Oh, Bobby retweeted one for one of the folks in Yakuza
1702980	1707860	that that was doing it's it's the same joke, but it's funny.
1707860	1711060	It's funny to see multiple people do it and like their characters voices.
1711060	1715140	So anyway, no, it has not been star, unfortunately,
1715140	1718500	but it is going to be somebody who it's it's going to be
1718740	1723060	the made for TV version of Chris Pratt is the voice is going to be.
1723900	1725900	Troy Baker, you think?
1725940	1727620	I don't know. He's the voice of everybody.
1727620	1730180	If I was my favorite voice, it's fine.
1730340	1733260	What's that? What I think what I think it is in the end is
1733260	1735140	that it's not any of our fucking business.
1735140	1736220	It doesn't matter either.
1736220	1738860	It's like, who cares? Like who the voice is? Yeah.
1739420	1742780	I'm going to go in with an open mind if other people don't go into there.
1742820	1743860	We'll screw them.
1743860	1746460	And I hope the guys, the person coming into it has tough skin.
1746900	1751460	But in the end, it doesn't matter because it's happened
1751460	1754980	and there will be a replacement deal with it. Pixel shades.
1755620	1759340	Just you need that for your little vtuber.
1759340	1760580	He needs some pixel shades.
1760580	1762180	I have some pixel shades.
1762180	1765140	I have to make a new model to put them on her, but I have some pixel shades.
1766180	1767260	No, but you you know what?
1767260	1770460	You make a great point, honestly, because if you think about it,
1770900	1773460	Charles Martinet was not always the voice of Mario.
1773500	1776420	And before him, most notably Captain Lou.
1776660	1780540	And a lot of us were of an age where Captain Lou was, you know,
1780700	1783180	let's do the barber yoga.
1783220	1786940	And I, by the way, in the movie, I love that they referenced that as well.
1786940	1788020	That was the coolest thing.
1788020	1789860	Actually, Captain Lou wasn't the first.
1789860	1792940	No, no. And I know he wasn't the first, but which I said earlier.
1792940	1797100	But, you know, my point is that when the voice changed
1797100	1801660	from Captain Lou to Charles Martinet, that was a big change.
1801820	1803180	But you know what?
1803180	1806460	People really dug Charles Martinet at the end of the day.
1806740	1810060	So whoever this new person is, give him a chance.
1810540	1815140	And it doesn't take anything away from the awesome legacy
1815140	1816580	that Charles Martinet has left.
1816580	1817700	And you know what?
1817700	1821300	If you love Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario,
1822060	1826980	go to a convention he's appearing at, pay him for a selfie and tell him so.
1827820	1828940	He'll appreciate that.
1828940	1830260	And then it's a win.
1830260	1834020	If you feel Charles Martinet should still
1834300	1837180	be getting paid, then by all means, pay him.
1838180	1841620	He is going to keep getting paid as the investor.
1841900	1842780	That's right. That's right.
1842780	1844380	He will still be getting paid for that role.
1844380	1846700	So he's basically pulling a Miyamoto.
1846700	1849060	What's the last game that Miyamoto actually programmed?
1849060	1850780	Actually programmed?
1850780	1855780	Oh, golly, I don't I feel like I heard he was in there
1855780	1859620	assisting with something in the not too distant past.
1859620	1862300	But yeah, not not from the ground up.
1862300	1864380	I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.
1864380	1866660	What modern programming languages does he know?
1867180	1871580	Yeah, I mean, seriously.
1871620	1873700	Yeah, I mean, back in.
1873700	1876620	I'm just saying, you know, back in the day, I think that like.
1878460	1881820	There was the big win in the 90s was,
1881820	1885020	you know, C++ and all that, so, yeah.
1885700	1887620	Well, in all these things,
1887620	1891660	probably assembly languages of various sorts for the old carts and all that.
1891660	1894580	So and now he's punch cards and they liked it.
1895500	1897500	It was Fortran.
1897500	1902180	No. Tiger Claw chat says they started adding a voice for Mario
1902180	1905380	once the N64 came out due to its processing power.
1905380	1907180	They were able to add some voiceovers.
1907180	1910580	They didn't. Did you remember what I said earlier in the show?
1910940	1912740	The last Metroid is in captivity.
1912740	1915180	That was some Super Nintendo magic there.
1915380	1918220	Of course, that probably took up half the cartridge right there,
1918220	1920620	but you could do it hypothetically.
1921460	1924380	Well, remember me talking about Star Ocean before?
1924380	1927220	Sure. How much voice acting that had
1928500	1933460	like a whole spoken introduction and voice acting on every battle level.
1934540	1938860	And they had to expand the the memory in the cartridge.
1939780	1943540	Well, if you want to go way, way back, go back to one of my favorite systems
1943540	1945380	ever that I never shut up about here on the show.
1945380	1949180	The Commodore 64 had some rad voice synth and it had games
1949180	1951220	like Impossible Mission the very beginning.
1951260	1955660	Another visitor stay a while, stay forever.
1956540	1958980	You think your Commodore 64 is really neato?
1958980	1962860	It is. What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?
1965300	1968500	OK, but the Commodore 64 had a legendary voice because Ghostbusters
1968500	1972860	actually had the in the very beginning when you would fire it up the Ghostbusters.
1973580	1976140	Like it actually there was a lot of like voice stuff again.
1976140	1978420	That was a computer from 1985.
1978420	1981100	So we've we've had voice acting of sorts.
1981260	1983460	For a long time. Look at Turtles in Time.
1983460	1986060	You had a lot of voice acting.
1986500	1989980	Oh, my God. I mean, it's just like listening
1989980	1993740	to Mickey Mouse today versus, you know, 30 years ago. Mm hmm.
1994340	1996620	It's a different voice.
1996620	1998940	But it's still Mickey Mouse.
1998940	2001300	Yep. You know, yep.
2001300	2004860	Or as Dark Tatia brings up Street Fighter two.
2004860	2008140	But I mean, think about the various iterations of the Street Fighter series
2008420	2011020	and how many different voice actors you've had over the years.
2011300	2014980	The view today is not the view from, you know, the late 80s.
2015860	2019820	Or take it a step further to mocap in the neighbor Mortal Kombat.
2019900	2024020	The person who mocapped Sonya back in the day is not still doing it today.
2024020	2027900	So, you know, of course, there were a lot of there were a lot of other things
2027900	2031060	at play with some changes between Mortal Kombat three and so forth.
2031060	2033020	But you could do a whole other show about that.
2033020	2035100	So anyway. All right.
2035980	2039220	Well, best of luck to whoever you know, it's again,
2039220	2042300	it's always kind of sad to see the changing of a guard.
2042300	2045540	But I think it is like one of those things you have to go.
2045580	2048100	This this happens artistically. It happens.
2048820	2051700	And it's great that Charles Martinet will still be touring conventions
2051700	2056260	and getting to do Mario in some capacity and allowing us to pay him
2056380	2059060	while still also collecting a paycheck of sorts from Nintendo.
2059780	2063420	And so I think we should all commit to not bullying the new person
2064260	2066500	and just seeing what the new game has to offer.
2066700	2069420	You know, and also the other thing, too, which is interesting.
2069420	2071900	So he's not doing the voice of Mario.
2071900	2073900	But what about all the other characters he does?
2074620	2076020	No mention of that. That's true.
2076020	2077020	No mention of Wario.
2077020	2080380	Well, Wario and Waluigi are never coming back, I'm sorry to say.
2081380	2084380	I'm kidding. But that's you ask a great question, though.
2084740	2087500	Or Luigi or like all the other stuff. Yeah.
2087740	2090180	Honestly, I think this is his way of saying retirement.
2090980	2094700	That's that's kind of your your voice is an instrument.
2094940	2100660	And on top of that, it's a a a series of muscles and nerves.
2100660	2103100	And as I can tell you from my own experience,
2103580	2107020	you know, doing stuff on phones and, you know, podcasting and streaming
2107020	2111300	and everything for as long as I have your instrument will give out.
2111620	2116900	Yeah, especially, you know, on in much older people.
2117780	2121740	It's going to just have even less resilience than it used to.
2122100	2125420	I would now I don't know how June four eight managed to do it
2125420	2128300	as long as she did, but she's also magical and a goddess.
2129700	2133740	But, you know, I think if this is retirement from voice
2133740	2136300	acting, then he's he's more than deserved it.
2136300	2140300	He's been doing this for a long time.
2140300	2146220	And I hope that he enjoys his ambassadorship and resting his voice. Yeah.
2147380	2149500	All right. Well, on that note, we're going to move on
2149500	2152300	and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games
2152300	2155060	we've been playing this week, Mario games or otherwise.
2155420	2157580	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
2157580	2159420	It was pretty OK.
2159420	2164020	I since my stream schedule is all thrown off from having to work
2164020	2167340	in an eight by five and get up at five a.m.
2167340	2169380	the freaking morning.
2170140	2173420	I did play the new Cult of the Lamb DLC.
2173420	2177340	It was like the Cult of the Lamb and don't starve crossover type thing.
2177620	2179900	They just basically had a new
2181060	2183380	a new cultist that you could add in.
2183380	2188220	We're like, if you kill one of your one of your people in your cult,
2189060	2192300	you're left with a skull and you bury their head in a grave.
2192300	2195380	And then the spider creature crawls out.
2195380	2197420	And he's just a normal person hanging around.
2197780	2199580	But he's got spiders all around him.
2199580	2204100	And there was like some decorative stuff that was really about it.
2204140	2206860	You know, it was just the game as usual after that.
2208220	2209900	I think it's still those cult of the lamb.
2209900	2212380	I love it. And every time something new comes out, I'm going to play it.
2213500	2216900	I'm trying to think, of course,
2217180	2220700	I played some Disney Dreamlight Valley, which I love that game.
2220700	2223500	I played some off stream just because it's such chill vibes.
2223500	2226500	You know, that's like my cozy game.
2226500	2229540	And then, of course, I played some Dead by Daylight,
2230620	2234900	still working on those killer that some might do a little bit more
2234940	2238180	off stream DVD.
2238180	2242100	I think the last adapt I got was finally
2242340	2244620	Pyramid Head after some struggle.
2246180	2249740	And then, of course, I played Live Alive last night.
2249740	2253980	I finished the ninja scenario, which was very complicated.
2254580	2258780	Like you have to go into these rooms and go back to these rooms.
2258780	2261980	You don't really have any clue on what you're supposed to do.
2262980	2267020	And if it wasn't that I had like a like a semi walk through
2267020	2270660	with sort of like a guide, I think I would have gotten very lost.
2272060	2278180	So as it stands, I have the the robot to do cube
2278660	2281740	and I have the
2282300	2285940	the other guy, the karate guy.
2285940	2289100	But it was the game is really good.
2289100	2294300	I loved the whole story and music for the lesson area that I did.
2294700	2299940	And I love that it's broken down into such digestible chapters is really.
2300460	2303860	And the last one was very, you know, steeped in,
2304420	2308300	you know, Japanese myth and, you know, combined with history.
2308300	2312180	And one of your enemies, by the way, is a giant koi who.
2312580	2314420	Yeah, I totally didn't fight the giant koi.
2314420	2317300	He was too hard, but I put a picture up.
2317660	2321300	But that's been it, I've been playing my word scapes
2321300	2324780	and they're turning it way much more into a money gouge
2324780	2326980	and I'm trying to tear myself away from it.
2329980	2334700	Oh, oh, and I did play a little bit just on my own of panorama cotton.
2335180	2338020	That game gives me kind of vertigo, but I also super love it.
2338020	2341060	You remember Rainbow Cotton, right? Yeah.
2341060	2344020	Panorama cotton style wise is its precursor.
2344220	2345340	It was on the Genesis.
2345340	2347660	They made the master system, I should say.
2348020	2350180	They made like 600 copies.
2350980	2356300	So, yeah, it is, however, now on the Switch eShop.
2356300	2359420	So definitely a Genesis game worth playing.
2359420	2361860	I think I've covered it before. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
2363380	2366580	All right. Well, we'll go over to Loki and your gaming week.
2366580	2369020	I feel like we probably covered a good chunk of the top.
2369020	2371460	Yeah, we've talked about a lot of it. I'll defer anyway.
2371900	2377620	It's been a lot of just Minecraft on the MCC practice server
2377620	2381740	and, of course, on MCC Island as well.
2381740	2383820	I played a little bit of that.
2384460	2387980	Yeah, it was basically all a lot of practice during the week.
2387980	2390580	We did take a break from practice to film
2391180	2395340	a bingo thing just with the team members.
2395340	2398180	So that's out now on Binish's channel.
2398180	2399500	And we did that. That was fun.
2399500	2400700	Our team won. Spoilers.
2402460	2404420	But yeah, it was a lot of fun.
2404420	2405820	It was a lot of practice.
2405820	2409540	Last day, we ended up doing a hide and seek on the practice server
2409540	2411100	as well in the Ace Race course.
2411100	2413940	So that was fun because they have a lot of like places
2413940	2416260	you can kind of get to that you're not supposed to.
2416260	2419860	And so we were just messing around with that a bit.
2419860	2422740	And that was pretty cool.
2422740	2426140	Yeah. And then, of course, you know, MCC yesterday was really big.
2426140	2429020	A lot of the week's actually been editing still.
2429020	2431500	I've been doing a lot of stuff with my final episode.
2431780	2436900	It's so this whole season has been kind of themed around like
2438580	2441780	you didn't compromise on.
2442380	2443220	You did too much.
2443220	2447540	You won't compromise on like reducing it down to something that's manageable.
2447700	2448940	And that's what the finale is.
2448940	2450860	It's like it's like too much.
2450860	2453460	And I'm not compromising on something that's more manageable.
2453460	2457100	Instead, I'm just, you know, going to the extreme with it.
2458100	2462900	So it gets pretty wild as far as like editing and stuff goes with it.
2463100	2465220	And I'm very excited to have it done.
2466020	2468220	I'm like, I have to look now.
2468500	2470420	I'm pretty far into it, actually.
2470420	2476820	I am already like 12 minutes into the episode already as far as fully edited.
2476820	2481460	But the problem is the shots that I'm doing now are very complicated.
2481460	2485100	So requires like six different replay shots for every shot that I do.
2485420	2487940	Just because of different camera changes and
2489380	2492860	having lots of characters teleport in and out of things.
2492980	2495660	There's lots of teleportation and time travel and all this.
2495660	2496820	It gets crazy, OK?
2496820	2499500	It gets very crazy.
2499500	2501300	So it's going to be fun.
2501300	2503180	I am very excited to get it done.
2503180	2505620	This week should be a lot easier to be able to concentrate on.
2505660	2508020	I'm not splitting my time between practice and
2509260	2511180	doing this stuff.
2511180	2512820	I do want to get back onto the server
2512820	2514580	to actually play with the new people and stuff.
2514580	2515900	They've been great.
2516540	2520060	We launched last week and and it's been fun.
2520060	2522340	So we have lots of people on the server now.
2523380	2526380	Shenang is happening and I haven't been part of it, a lot of it,
2526380	2530020	because I haven't been on there, but I'm hoping to change that this week.
2530020	2534860	So, yeah, it's just kind of switching gears
2534860	2539420	from like overly complex and like big, huge things to try to make it more manageable.
2539980	2542540	That said, I will easily slip into old habits.
2543500	2545580	Pretty, it's going to happen.
2545580	2548740	I guess it's just a matter of when I'm going to just do it.
2549140	2553180	But I think with the fact that this season is going to be all based around
2554860	2558780	an amusement park, so building an amusement park with rides and mini,
2558780	2561060	it's all focused on rides and mini games.
2561060	2564940	And so because of that, it's a lot of design that's going to have to go into it.
2564940	2568060	So I don't think I can rush through it very much
2568060	2570540	because designing mini games takes a long time.
2570980	2574820	And so I'm going to try to break those projects up a bit if I can,
2574820	2578460	because otherwise it'll be like two months between episodes and I'll do that.
2578660	2580780	So we'll see. We'll figure it out.
2580780	2583300	But it's going to be fun. All right.
2584540	2588500	My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff, a lot of the same old stuff.
2588500	2591180	Still playing a little bit Diablo for Final Fantasy 14.
2591180	2594740	I needed to do the Moonfire Fair event to make sure
2594740	2597580	I get my little Power Rangers outfit that they were given away this year.
2597860	2601140	I need to make sure I do their new event before I leave for Atlanta,
2601140	2603580	because I don't know if I'd have time when I get back.
2603580	2605740	I passed in Diablo four.
2605740	2609500	So my eternal character, whatever the permanent realm is called,
2609660	2612140	was level 61 when the season started.
2612140	2614140	And now my season character is 62.
2614140	2616340	So I've officially passed that point
2616340	2619540	where my season character is now stronger than my non seasonal one.
2620140	2622980	And I'm almost completely through the battle pass.
2622980	2626340	There's 90 stages, the battle pass. I hit 84 today.
2626660	2629860	I'll probably clear the battle pass completely.
2630300	2633500	But granted, because I bought the Uber edition,
2633500	2636380	I had like a skip for 20 tiers or something.
2636380	2640020	And then Amazon Prime was given away like four additional skips.
2640260	2641580	So I was like, all right, whatever.
2641580	2644260	So I can't say I did it all myself, but I
2644820	2647820	considering I have until October for the season to be done,
2647820	2649020	I probably would play enough.
2650500	2653700	And then I've actually been playing a little bit of Overwatch two.
2653700	2656300	Funny enough, I didn't really think I'd get back into this
2656300	2660340	game, but I have a couple friend groups that are like, yeah, you should play.
2660340	2662860	You should play. So I've been playing a little bit.
2662860	2666500	And I find that I really enjoy playing Anna, actually.
2666500	2668020	And I never thought I was very good with her,
2668020	2669980	but she's actually a lot of fun to heal with.
2669980	2670820	So I've been doing that.
2670820	2673540	And then today I was exploring the PVE a little bit.
2674220	2678580	I didn't buy the thing because I'm still trying to get a sense of if that's worth it.
2678780	2681700	But they have like a limited time event that I already forgot the name of it,
2681700	2684620	underworld or something like that, that has some different modes.
2685140	2687860	There's like a regular mode and then there's like a don't stand
2687860	2689140	where the rockets are going to fall.
2689140	2691580	And then like basically like
2691980	2694820	good zones and bads and another mode that's bad zones.
2694820	2697180	So it's yeah, it's interesting.
2697500	2700660	So I like that you get a lot of credit for
2701060	2703740	not that I really care about the battle past Overwatch to begin
2703740	2707220	a lot of credit for that type of stuff, even if
2708460	2710940	you do the PVE stuff, which I find very interesting.
2711300	2714220	But yeah, also tip on that.
2714220	2717660	And this helped me incentivize me to play Xbox.
2717660	2722500	Game Pass has a thing where you can unlock all of the new heroes
2722500	2726740	in Overwatch to right up through the brand new healer lady.
2726740	2728060	I think her name's Ilari.
2728060	2729300	I hope I didn't get that wrong.
2729300	2731540	But you can unlock everybody through her.
2731540	2734980	All the people that have come out since Overwatch two on Game Pass.
2734980	2739580	But you have to launch it on Xbox first
2739900	2743180	and then through cross network stuff, it unlocks on your PC.
2743500	2745660	So that's that's what I did. And it worked.
2745940	2748140	So, yeah, I'll take it.
2748140	2750420	But yeah, that was that was honestly pretty much it.
2750420	2752700	My game, I think I maybe played one game of Dead by Daylight,
2752700	2755060	but I've been I've been kind of sleeping on that a little bit.
2755060	2758420	I think I'll I'll be more excited when the alien stuff comes out,
2758420	2759220	which is next week.
2759220	2761460	Well, I guess not because I'm going to be out of town.
2761460	2764020	So maybe in two weeks, I'll get around to doing some of the alien stuff.
2764020	2766740	But can't wait to play as Ripley, to be quite honest.
2766860	2768620	That'd be awesome. I'll play it.
2768620	2771180	Yeah. Oh, yeah.
2771180	2774140	Well, actually, and also looking forward a little bit,
2774140	2777180	what I'm actually really excited for, believe it or not, is Starfield.
2778060	2782940	Just since I have Game Pass anyway, I'm absolutely going to pick it up.
2783820	2787380	And I'm excited to see how it turned out.
2787380	2791820	You know, there's a lot of chat about is this perhaps again?
2791820	2795180	I guess there's rumors out there because people are playing it right now. Right.
2795420	2799140	So even though it's embargoed, there is still some stuff getting out
2799780	2801860	and you take it with a grain of salt.
2801860	2805180	But one of the things that is getting out is that it is absolutely
2805180	2809740	the least buggy Bethesda game and that that extra time kind of shows.
2809740	2814300	So it'll be now again, take it with a big grain of salt, because I think,
2814540	2816580	you know, who's playing the embargo right now?
2816580	2818140	Journalists and influencers.
2818140	2820180	That's who's playing the embargo on right now.
2820180	2822100	Then when it gets out in front of the rest of the Internet,
2822100	2823780	they're probably going to find things the others miss.
2823780	2827260	So I you know, but that's just what some of the early buzz is.
2827460	2829020	So I'll be very curious.
2829060	2830540	That reminds me because of space.
2830540	2833860	One other game I played this week was No Man's Sky just a little bit
2834500	2837980	because I got my PlayStation version up and running because I was like,
2838300	2841140	I want to chase some PlayStation five trophies in this game.
2841140	2843980	I think I'm going to make a new little get the get my trophies in this.
2844420	2847180	I played just a little bit for a night.
2847180	2848540	I got like two trophies.
2848540	2850500	And then I was like, I'm going to stream some of this later.
2850500	2853300	And then the very next day.
2853300	2856700	The echoes update came out and added all the new stuff.
2856740	2859740	And so it was like, oh, well, if I stream this again, I'm going to.
2859740	2862380	And then I got sidetracked to like Dragon Con stuff and IRL stuff.
2862380	2863700	So I haven't really been streaming,
2863700	2866940	even though No Man's Sky has a whole twitch drop thing going on again right now,
2866940	2868180	which I'd love to participate in.
2868180	2870580	But it's just really bad timing.
2870580	2872180	It's a bummer. But yeah.
2872180	2874380	Yeah. Questmaster says the echoes update is so massive.
2874380	2877380	I guess they added a fourth alien race. That's huge.
2878220	2879740	That's pretty incredible.
2879740	2882420	So I'm I look forward to checking it out at some point.
2883300	2885860	Anyway, let's get into some other gaming news.
2885860	2887700	What else is going on around the industry?
2887700	2890660	I'm going to take it to Loki to start us off tonight
2890660	2893860	with a little bit of a wrap up of what happened at Gamescom.
2893860	2896660	And I'm very sorry I need to step away for a moment, but take it away, Loki.
2897220	2900620	Yeah. So with Gamescom, of course, we had opening night live,
2900620	2903100	which was with Jeff Keighley.
2903100	2908500	And with that, of course, lots of new trailers for different game titles.
2909020	2911860	Some of these, of course, just coming out recently.
2911860	2915820	So, for example, we got a launch trailer for Armored Core 6, Fires of Rubicon.
2916620	2920780	Which launched this Friday and looks awesome.
2920780	2922420	I need to pick it up.
2922540	2925420	Alan Wake 2 got a new trailer as well.
2925780	2927460	It looks pretty sweet.
2927460	2932020	We got the announcement that Age of Empires 4 anniversary edition
2932020	2934900	is now on Xbox Series X and S.
2936660	2940180	Aura History Untold looked pretty cool.
2940700	2942820	A live action Starfield trailer.
2942860	2945380	I'm assuming this is the launch trailer for that as well,
2945380	2948420	since this comes out literally in a couple of weeks here.
2949380	2950620	Yeah, on the 6th, actually.
2950620	2952460	So that's pretty nice.
2952460	2954460	And what else?
2955020	2956180	Another cool stuff.
2956180	2958140	Assassin's Creed Mirage gameplay.
2958140	2960100	That looks pretty cool.
2960100	2961700	Black Myth Wukong.
2961700	2963340	I think we've seen this before.
2963340	2965260	It looks interesting.
2965260	2969740	It's kind of that whole Chinese mythology, like an action RPG.
2970460	2972700	I want to say we saw that around E3 time as well.
2973660	2978100	Call of Duty Modern Warfare got some story gameplay.
2978100	2983340	It showed off the first mission in the game and looks pretty cool.
2983340	2987420	I try to think back to the original Modern Warfare 3
2987820	2990540	and the mission in that if it's actually like a direct remake
2990540	2992900	or if they're just kind of doing something else.
2993020	2994460	I don't recall it, though.
2994460	2997180	I know I played through it and it was a great game.
2997180	2999780	So I'm kind of curious, maybe I should check this out.
3001100	3004780	Crew Motorfest had also another launch
3004780	3008220	or had a launch trailer as well that's coming out on September 14th.
3009060	3011300	Crimson Desert got a trailer
3011420	3015940	and it's showing off some of the new gameplay as well.
3016620	3020980	Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty had another trailer as well.
3020980	3024140	We just got one of those at Summer Games Fest.
3024900	3030300	Dustborne kind of looks interesting, very cool, a stylized looking game.
3030300	3033700	Kind of reminds me a little bit of Sunset Overdrive, but
3034940	3036580	very cool looking.
3036580	3040460	Diablo 4 got the Season of Blood announcement as well.
3040940	3042540	Talking about that.
3042540	3046700	Genshin Impact had a trailer as well as Honkai Star Rail,
3046700	3050180	the announcement trailer for PlayStation 5.
3050900	3055940	And then we've got Mudrunner or Expeditions Mudrunner.
3056540	3062140	There is a premiere for that, and that's the game that's by Snowrunner as well.
3062380	3067300	Snowrunner is kind of a very extremely realistic off-roading game,
3067300	3070980	if I remember correctly, and that's coming out next year.
3071660	3075540	Granblue Fantasy Relink, a new JRPG,
3075580	3080380	and that's supposed to be coming out on February 1st, 2024.
3081500	3084540	What else? The First Descendant.
3084540	3087860	Looks pretty cool looking.
3087860	3090100	A lot of these games are never going to play though, unfortunately.
3090700	3096260	Fort Solace, which, of course, has Troy Baker, Juliet Brown, Roger Clark.
3096860	3101420	And, you know, very story driven game there.
3101980	3104380	Mortals of Avium.
3104380	3107740	Looks like that's a Magic based FPS game.
3108500	3110060	Very interested to play that.
3110060	3114220	You know, once again, gives me the old heretic Hexen vibes, of course.
3114700	3117780	And I think it's coming out later this year.
3118340	3122020	We had Killing Floor 3
3122860	3127660	got a pretty cool cinematic trailer as well.
3128660	3131660	Little Nightmares 3, didn't even realize they had a third sequel for that,
3131660	3134020	but that's going to be coming out next year as well.
3134580	3140660	The Lords of Fallen remake that is going to got a brand new story trailer.
3140980	3144100	Is that a remake? I actually maybe that's just a new RPG.
3144100	3145620	I thought there was a Lords of Fallen game.
3145620	3148020	I swear that that sounds awfully familiar,
3149180	3151500	but that is going to be coming out as well.
3152060	3152780	This is kind of cool.
3152780	3156540	I mean, once again, a game I don't necessarily play, but I'm aware of Marvel Snap.
3156860	3159780	They had a cool cinematic trailer that they put out for that.
3160140	3163260	Honestly, I'll take just like the Marvel Snap animated
3163460	3165580	like show at this point.
3165580	3169980	I mean, with Deadpool in there and all the different iterations
3169980	3171180	and all the anime style.
3171180	3174340	Yes, please give me some like anime Marvel stuff.
3174580	3177020	I'm down for that with Squirrel Girl and all that.
3177420	3179020	So please.
3179460	3183860	Moral Combat 1, they had a new trailer for that as well.
3184260	3188060	And kind of also clean up the fatalities and whatnot.
3188140	3191220	And I just I just want to say that when they announced
3191220	3194140	Sindel, the gays cried out. Yes.
3196580	3198860	Because I know I'm very excited to see Sindel back.
3199980	3204780	And she's she's like the right kind of Sindel.
3205540	3206820	Oh, she's does that make sense?
3206820	3208820	No, she's stunning. She's good guy, Sindel.
3208820	3210700	Yeah, no, she's good guy, Sindel.
3210700	3212820	Oh, yeah, because yeah, because they you know, they're
3212860	3215860	they're having fun with the reboot. Yeah.
3215860	3216900	Yeah, yeah.
3216900	3220140	I've watched like the whole 17 minutes of that game.
3220580	3221780	Are you going to jump?
3221780	3224980	I imagine Mortal Combat 1 is out on Steam, so you ought to be able to.
3225620	3227180	It's got to be on cloud somewhere.
3227180	3229420	Are you going to jump in on Mortal Combat 1, Jamie?
3232820	3234900	I'm probably going to watch a lot of other people play it.
3235380	3236100	OK, fair enough.
3236100	3239220	It does have me like I don't like Mortal Combat
3239300	3242340	just because I'm not really a big fighting game fan anyways,
3242340	3244380	but when it came down like Street Fighter, Mortal Combat,
3244620	3247220	like I definitely was more Street Fighter.
3249460	3253180	I mean, I do like the DLC characters that they have, like both Homelander
3253180	3256220	and what's his name from?
3257660	3259980	From Invincible.
3259980	3261300	I don't remember his name.
3261300	3264060	It it looks incredible.
3264260	3266900	So Omni Man, Omni Man, thank you.
3266900	3268020	I couldn't remember.
3268020	3268620	I will say this.
3268620	3271700	I thought we had this on our show, but I guess I bumped it for something else.
3271740	3273540	But dark to see a reminds me.
3273540	3277020	Apparently, the fatalities all have descriptive audio.
3277180	3279940	And yeah, I saw you and it's hilarious.
3279940	3281900	It's great. It's great.
3281900	3282780	It's pretty awesome.
3282780	3284700	This British lady
3285060	3287260	hiding it in such a flat monotone.
3288020	3288700	That's right.
3288700	3291500	And now we want to see that he's written.
3291500	3294700	So she reaches for his for his neck and the spine breaks
3294700	3297020	and you see the blood coming out through the X-ray.
3297540	3298180	It's great.
3298180	3299580	That's what she sounds like.
3299580	3301660	I love it. I love that.
3301660	3304700	That needs to be a staple in like all the fighting games. Mm hmm.
3305460	3307300	But I mean, I mean, as
3307300	3309500	and I want to point out, even though we're kind of laughing at it,
3309500	3313460	because it's kind of like the it's like the absurdity of these games brought to life
3313780	3317620	from an accessibility standpoint, that is bold, underlined, italic,
3317900	3321940	fucking awesome that they're doing that, you know, and even though we're having to.
3322020	3326340	Yeah, it's just we're teeing it because it brings the absurdity of Mortal Combat
3326340	3329580	really just to the front and center and lays it on the table, you know.
3329900	3331340	It's the voice, though.
3331340	3333700	It's the lady's voice that does it for me.
3334180	3338860	But it's and so after a knee to the groin, he doubles over in pain
3339060	3343100	when she uses the opportunity to then bash his head in with a mallet.
3343420	3345660	I like it.
3345780	3348140	It definitely sounds like and I hate to do a South Park.
3348220	3349460	My impression is good.
3349460	3352820	I hope I hate to do a South Park reference in the year 2023.
3352820	3354860	But it definitely reminds me of that one
3354860	3358460	episode of like, thank you for calling the Worcestershire sauce company.
3358460	3361300	If you're having a problem with Worcestershire, it's like that whole
3361460	3364380	when I think they're turned into town into zombies or something.
3364380	3366700	And it was very cool, collected British lady.
3366900	3369700	It sounded like that in the
3369700	3373860	trailers or the this audio description anyway. And.
3375580	3377220	She sounds very bought.
3377220	3381500	Yes, Bonsobo six says the fans went wild for Sandel.
3381500	3384220	I saw so many streamers calling her new mommy.
3384260	3386780	Yes, that is Sandel's mother.
3386780	3389060	Yes, she's mother is mothering.
3390180	3393500	Although I am very curious now with the changes with the whole
3393500	3397220	Tarkatan thing, like what's what's Molina's deal? Mm hmm.
3398100	3400820	So I'm into it like that was for me.
3400820	3402100	I love the story.
3402100	3406180	I just I I haven't played a Mortal Combat game
3406180	3408580	and had fun since, you know, Mortal Combat.
3409500	3412140	Two for a hot minute, actually, Mortal Combat two
3412140	3414780	is probably still the pinnacle of Mortal Combat for me.
3415300	3417860	I mean, same, but yeah.
3420420	3422220	Let's see what else we had some Sonic stuff.
3422220	3426020	So Sonic Frontiers, the final horizon is going to be, I think, a bit of
3426660	3428780	DLC or an update that they're going to be getting.
3428780	3432620	And they showed off that it has new stories and new playable characters.
3433620	3437340	Sonic Superstars had another new trailer as well, showing off
3437340	3439460	some of the co-op gameplay with that.
3440220	3442860	We got a new trailer for Tekken eight,
3442860	3445140	which showed off its arcade simulation mode
3446900	3448420	under the waves.
3448420	3451740	Got a new trailer as well, which is actually that game's
3451740	3453860	coming out this week, so we'll have to check that out.
3454860	3457660	This trailer absolutely blew me away.
3457700	3459140	I need to play this game.
3459140	3463980	I hope it's not just for PlayStation, because it was on the PlayStation Japan
3464340	3468940	YouTube page, but it's called Thank Goodness You're Here.
3469180	3472700	It is a hand drawn animated game.
3472740	3475620	I don't know what it is, but it looks strange and I love it.
3475980	3477260	I love the art style.
3477260	3478660	I love the humor of it.
3478660	3480500	I want this game now.
3480500	3483300	Like, it looks amazing.
3483940	3486380	And I think that's supposed to be coming out next year at some point.
3486380	3489740	So cross my fingers that it's not just Sony.
3491260	3491820	What else?
3491900	3495140	We had a non-video game stuff
3495140	3499340	with the Netflix trailer for Zack Snyder's
3499340	3503300	new movie or movies with Rebel Moon.
3504140	3507820	That is going to be coming out, I think, next year or later this year
3507820	3508500	or something like that.
3508500	3509660	I just want to get a couple of quick comments.
3509660	3510620	Interesting.
3510620	3513300	Orange Right says there's a trailer for Thank Goodness You're Here
3513300	3514620	on Nintendo's YouTube.
3514620	3519500	So, OK, good. OK, so it is on multiple consoles, but it looks fantastic.
3519540	3520660	Like, absolutely.
3520660	3522580	Watch the trailer if you haven't done it yet.
3522580	3525500	It's just like it's it's almost Monty Python ish.
3525500	3529700	It looks very similar to tell what I'm bringing up on the other screen.
3529700	3531660	Sorry, because I want to take a look at this myself
3531660	3533940	because I wasn't able to watch the live event.
3533940	3536540	I think like some of you were able to.
3537260	3541780	So, yeah, it's absolutely cool looking like this is the game that
3543420	3546060	looks the most interesting to me.
3546060	3548100	Yeah, it definitely looks like a full on cartoon.
3548100	3551180	But I mean, that's what games are capable of doing these days.
3551180	3552220	So that's very interesting.
3552220	3554940	It just looks weird and I like weird.
3554940	3558260	So OK, I'm down for this.
3558260	3560860	It looks just strange.
3560980	3562140	All right, let's check that out.
3562140	3563420	Mike Deft is also asking,
3563420	3566940	have you seen the trailer for Killer Bean, the game that is up your alley?
3566940	3568380	I have seen so.
3568380	3573500	OK, I'm not familiar with Killer Bean as like a YouTube series.
3573500	3576140	I understand it is very old, obviously,
3576380	3580020	but it sounds like the game is really cool, like very like they said
3580380	3582540	compared to like John Wick and stuff.
3582540	3584420	So I cool.
3584420	3588340	I will have to check it out, but I'm not familiar with the Killer Bean lore.
3588820	3592300	But that does look extremely cool.
3592740	3595180	And I'm glad that it's getting its own game.
3595180	3597740	I mean, this whole ridiculousness of shooting from a car,
3597740	3600460	then jumping out on your jet pack and shooting from your jet pack
3600460	3602620	and then on the ground and shooting for your guns on the ground.
3602860	3604940	It does seem very low key to me.
3604980	3606140	It's OK.
3606140	3609620	So it's very much Saints Row.
3610860	3613180	Just cause, you know, granted,
3613940	3615900	dark like all smashed into one. Exactly.
3615900	3619540	So here's the thing is like, OK, well, if I can't get my Saints
3619540	3623220	Row gameplay from Saints Row, I'm just going to have to get it from Killer Bean
3623220	3626220	then, like this is the type of stuff that you should be doing.
3626420	3627940	Look, it's ridiculous.
3627940	3631700	I don't mean to be shady, but this looks like the game that this looks like
3631700	3635540	the kind of game that has a great trailer and then gets a 34 on Metacritic.
3635780	3638420	Not that Metacritic is the end all be all, but it just it
3638420	3643100	it kind of looks like one of those games that I again, maybe I'll be wrong.
3643340	3646180	It's just one of those games that probably actually runs like, oh, sure.
3646220	3648220	Like, honestly, it doesn't look super great.
3648220	3652180	Like it does look like PlayStation three era stuff. We'll see. We'll see.
3652180	3655220	But I mean, is the game plays there?
3655220	3656460	All right. Anyway, sorry.
3656460	3660060	You were talking about non game related things, Loki, like the Netflix stuff.
3660060	3661620	Yeah. So, yeah, Rebel Moon.
3661620	3662340	There's going to be two.
3662340	3667820	It's a Zack Snyder film and it's supposed to be like R rated Star Wars type of thing.
3667820	3670420	I mean, it's very Star Wars looking.
3670420	3674140	And also there's unicorn or not.
3674380	3676580	It was a unicorn or no, it was a Griffin.
3676580	3678860	There's like a Griffin thing.
3679020	3681100	And they're supposed to be split up in two movies.
3681100	3683940	And he has like a director's cut, which is five hours long as well,
3684100	3686780	because, you know, it's Zack Snyder and that's the kind of thing he does.
3687380	3689900	So that'll be coming out at some point.
3690060	3694220	Um, well, so we had a trailer for Payday three
3694940	3697180	with Ice-T making a cameo in that.
3697900	3701620	Oh, I guess, um, Nightingale.
3701740	3704940	It's a horror card based survival game.
3704980	3707020	So that looks interesting.
3707580	3710740	And I think that was it.
3711100	3712140	Oh, Last Epoch.
3712140	3715020	They showed some gameplay footage from that as well.
3716300	3719380	And that there was some dude that ran up
3719380	3722460	on stage and asked about Grand Theft Auto six,
3722460	3725980	because Jeff Keighley has poor security at his events
3726380	3728420	and people just rust the stage now.
3728580	3730380	Yeah, that was going to get hurt.
3730380	3733220	Well, I was really messed up, though, to be quite honest, like.
3734300	3735740	We should be past this point.
3735740	3736380	You know what I mean?
3736380	3741140	Like, it's let the man have a taser on stage at this point, to be honest.
3741140	3742940	Or just like better security.
3742940	3745980	Like, how are these people getting in these events?
3745980	3747300	Like, honestly, like
3748300	3752420	who are these people that are just getting in and you're just like
3752420	3755820	they're letting them run up on stage and like, OK, cool.
3755980	3757340	Anybody can do this now.
3757340	3759820	Now it's happened twice and now people are going to try even harder.
3759820	3763500	Yeah, like you got to you got to get this stuff under control, man.
3764020	3765500	Yeah, it's for your own safety.
3765500	3769180	I mean, because like what if someone's just really mad at you
3769180	3771580	and then they decide, oh, hey, I'm just going to go kill him,
3771580	3774140	you know, rush up on stage and like, you know,
3774860	3778860	because I want to make a scene and and be infamous that way, like.
3780260	3782620	You got to get that stuff under control. Yeah.
3783780	3787100	All right, well, I think they were right to maybe temper
3787100	3790140	the expectations a little bit, but I think by doing so, they ended up
3790140	3793580	having a fairly successful like, you know, I think they delivered
3793580	3794380	on what they promised.
3794380	3797140	It was updates on games and a few interesting new things.
3797980	3800380	I think they set the expectations very well.
3801100	3805180	And that's that's definitely a hint for what to do in the future, for sure.
3805700	3808100	So, yeah, because I think they were like saying, like, listen,
3808100	3811300	we're not going to be announcing like another Zelda Breath of the Wild.
3811340	3814540	Here's the kingdom nonsense that, you know, like really simmered
3814540	3816260	those expectations down.
3816260	3819340	Yeah, we'll save that for, you know, the game awards as well.
3819340	3822260	Well, now it's all that stuff which is going to be happening.
3822500	3824740	And, you know, it was confirmed it's happening,
3824740	3827500	but that really shouldn't be a surprise, right? So, yeah.
3828380	3829460	All right. Moving on.
3829460	3830500	Let's talk about some other news
3830500	3832860	that came out around the same time this week.
3833140	3835300	Let's talk about Arcade 1up, because you'll notice
3835300	3838380	if you watch a live on Twitch, I have a couple of these machines.
3838620	3839940	I think they're fun.
3839940	3842260	Some collectible purists don't care for them.
3842260	3843220	I think they're neat.
3843220	3845700	I think it's fun to have in a little game room.
3845700	3848140	I actually I didn't talk about during my game week, gaming week,
3848140	3850580	but I did play my Tron machine a little bit this week.
3850700	3852660	So I do actually play them once in a while.
3852660	3855060	Not all the time, but I do. I do actually play them.
3855420	3858900	And, you know, many of you who do watch live notice
3858900	3862660	I have the perfect amount of space for a third machine,
3862660	3864900	although I'd probably have to move the couch if I did it.
3864900	3866140	And that's my napping couch.
3866140	3871020	I don't know how I feel about that, but I have my couch looks familiar.
3871100	3874460	I it from my mom's place.
3875340	3878660	No, the ones that used to be yours downstairs. Yeah.
3879220	3880300	No. OK. Yeah.
3880300	3881780	A moment. It looks like it.
3881780	3884100	But yeah. So this
3885580	3887820	space at some point will get filled in.
3887820	3891260	And there's a really good contender here for what they announced this week.
3891260	3896940	And that is a time crisis machine that is coming out for six hundred dollars.
3897260	3898260	But here's the thing.
3898260	3902620	Time crisis is the main game in it and what everything is kind of labeled as.
3902620	3903580	But guess what?
3903580	3906700	Since it is a Namco game with light guns,
3907700	3910620	guess what's in the the list of other games?
3911060	3914660	Point blank is also in the time crisis machine.
3914700	3916860	Oh, no, I don't need to know this.
3916900	3918220	I don't want to know this.
3918220	3920900	I know that's the bucket list right there.
3920900	3922300	I know. But here's the thing.
3922300	3925340	It's not point blank and point blank, too. So.
3926620	3928740	But yeah, that's I know.
3928740	3930700	So it's time crisis point blank.
3930700	3935940	Steel Gunner and Steel Gunner two are what make up this cabinet here.
3935940	3939900	So, yeah, if they did a point blank branded one
3940140	3943060	with both point blanks in it, because I think there was only two in the arcade.
3943060	3946020	Right. There was a they have a new one now as well.
3946220	3948300	Oh, they have a ticket game, don't they?
3948300	3950260	No, it's not a ticket game. It's called Gum Bullet.
3950260	3954340	It's it's a new one that they actually have at the round one near us
3954620	3955700	because I've played it there.
3955700	3960500	OK, but yeah, it's it's not a ticket game either.
3961780	3965020	Well, there were some other machines that were announced as well worth pointing out.
3965260	3966980	Galaga is another machine coming.
3966980	3970060	But these are these are kind of just rebranding of things
3970060	3971580	they've already put out, to be quite honest.
3971580	3974140	Galaga is going to release Galaga again.
3974300	3978020	I mean, honestly, like that in Pac-Man, they've kind of done this machine before.
3978020	3982460	It's just all the big Namco hits, but it's just the Galaga branding now in a full.
3982460	3984060	I think this might be a full size.
3984060	3985900	Oh, that's what it is. It's a deluxe.
3985900	3989500	So it's a full size cab as opposed to the ones behind me are actually what?
3989500	3991740	Three quarter of the, you know, normal size.
3991740	3995020	And speaking of deluxe, a Street Fighter two deluxe.
3995260	3999820	Again, they've had a regular, but the full size machine is coming later this year.
4000020	4002740	Also kind of interesting.
4002780	4004300	Wheel of Fortune.
4004300	4005540	They have casino machines.
4005540	4008140	Oh, yeah. The Wheel of Fortune machine is apparently legit.
4008180	4009980	Like it's it's interesting.
4009980	4012140	This machine looked interesting to me, too.
4012380	4016300	It's an Atari 50th anniversary deluxe machine.
4017020	4020140	The only thing I like what they're putting in it.
4020460	4025900	I just don't like the look like I can only take so much of that Atari 50 logo.
4025900	4031740	And I really wish they'd kept the 50 maybe on the riser and on the marquee.
4031940	4035580	But maybe done a compilation of Atari are on the side.
4035580	4040780	I don't just like white panel the side and then like an Atari logo or something like that.
4041340	4043940	So I don't love the look of this thing.
4043940	4047460	But this thing apparently does have quite a few games in it
4047460	4051220	because it actually has 50 Atari 2600 games.
4051220	4054580	That's a first for these cabs to have the console games actually in them.
4054780	4058660	And then it has their typical I mean, they've had Atari arcade one ups before,
4058660	4061300	whether it was branded centipede or the branded Tempest.
4061500	4064060	It pretty much has the usual lineups in there no matter what.
4064060	4068220	But the fact that it's deluxe means it's going to be a big one and so on and so on.
4068220	4072340	So yeah, like I like the machine in theory.
4072340	4073740	I just don't like how it looks.
4073740	4077460	So I kind of I kind of hope there's a refresh of that, to be honest,
4077460	4080660	because I might get it if they were to put out one that looked a little different.
4081140	4084900	So. But yeah, that was some news out of arcade one up.
4084900	4090820	So fun, fun for the collectors that like to drop this way for the point blank.
4091220	4093460	When they come out eventually.
4093460	4095540	All right. Well, speaking of honestly,
4096060	4098420	you could probably just buy a point blank at this point.
4099220	4102300	I mean, I mean, yeah, honestly. Yeah. Like.
4103460	4105540	I wonder how they get. Yeah, you'd have to find one.
4105660	4107860	I wonder how hard it would be to fix if it was broken.
4108300	4111340	But I guess there's no specialty.
4112180	4117540	Like there's some glass shops that actually sell the tubes for a CRT
4117860	4119860	and transistors for, you know, classic
4121060	4122940	audio receivers and whatnot.
4122940	4126660	Yeah, I need to have someone come repair my my monitor in my
4127260	4130660	Astra City because it is no worky.
4130860	4132420	Oh, that's a bummer.
4132420	4133380	Yeah. All right.
4133380	4138220	Well, speaking of anticipated releases, Dark Soccer's next story is about one.
4139500	4143100	Well, it's more about what happens when you jump the gun.
4144100	4149460	So there's been, you know, talk and speculation about Starfield coming out
4149820	4156220	and a guy has been arrested and charged with theft of the game.
4157620	4159540	It is a 29 year old.
4159540	4164180	Darren Harris posted the first 45 minutes of the game online.
4165580	4169700	And of course, it was taken down from YouTube, but people were still sharing it.
4169700	4173940	He also posted listings for additional copies of the game.
4174340	4178540	And there were videos of him going to FedEx to pay to ship it.
4179940	4182900	The affidavit was filed in Shelby County
4183940	4187580	and the Memphis Police Department
4188140	4191980	were also reached out to by head of security and loss prevention
4191980	4194460	at Vantiva, formerly Technicolor,
4195660	4198220	telling them about the theft and that some of the victims
4198380	4202900	about the theft and that Starfield was not available for release until September 6th.
4203540	4207820	Of course, they basically with
4209380	4211580	the two facilities working together,
4212980	4216980	they were able to get a search warrant and search through Harris's home.
4217340	4220980	They found a FedEx package sealed with a copy of the game
4221420	4226700	for Xbox Series Starfield games and two Xbox Series upgrade editions
4227180	4231900	and three handguns and some pot that one of the handguns was stolen.
4233260	4236180	So he was arrested on August 24th.
4236180	4238580	So just a couple of days ago.
4238580	4241540	Now, he told the police, Harris that is, told the police
4241540	4245460	that he purchased the game from an unknown individual.
4246220	4249460	But anyway, he was charged with felony
4249460	4254220	theft of property between twenty five hundred and ten thousand dollars.
4254220	4257540	Misdemeanor, theft and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.
4258540	4260420	Oh, that's right. It's not legal there.
4260420	4262180	Yeah, I was going to say, the marijuana charge is bullshit,
4262180	4263860	but the rest of it is, you know.
4263860	4266980	Yeah, he's got a bond of ten thousand dollars,
4266980	4270220	which is posted on this past Friday.
4270780	4273620	And yeah, so.
4275540	4280860	Yeah, he got caught in this day and age, it's almost impossible not to get caught.
4280900	4283140	Well, especially when you're filming yourself doing it
4283140	4285180	and being so brazen about it, that's the thing.
4285180	4289020	It he, you know, to be clear, he's not they're entitled to it.
4289060	4293220	Yeah, he's not arrested for broadcasting the game early on YouTube.
4293220	4295060	That's a very hard thing to.
4295060	4296740	And plus, that would be really a criminal thing.
4296740	4299580	That could be a civil thing, but it wouldn't be something this quick.
4299860	4305460	It's the whole like essentially the FedExing video is that that's the problem,
4305460	4309380	because, you know, in order for this thing to be in this guy's possession,
4309380	4311020	it would have had to have been stolen.
4311060	4314940	As they point out, it was not set to release until September six.
4315220	4319220	This person I am imagining is not an official distributor of the product.
4319220	4322660	Therefore, there's only one way that this individual gets the product.
4322820	4325060	Now, whether he stole it or somebody stole it for him,
4325180	4330300	he's still in possession of it and trying to sell it and filming himself doing so.
4331020	4332660	And that's a crime.
4332660	4336220	And I just want to point out that the same guy is not the same dude
4336220	4337860	who's the CEO of Jack in the Box.
4338740	4342500	I did not know that the CEO of Jack in the Box had the same name,
4343020	4347540	which is ironic when you consider the type of food the Jack in the Box sells.
4348340	4351300	But I all of it fried, even the tacos are deep fried.
4351300	4352380	It's disgusting.
4352380	4353580	It's it's stoner food.
4353580	4354340	That's all it is.
4354340	4354980	Jack in the box.
4354980	4358420	It's just call it's they should just call it four twenty six nine
4358420	4360460	because that is what Jack in the Box food is.
4362700	4365300	They had a they had a was it one of those
4365380	4367260	was it one of those
4368100	4370860	late night meals or whatever that's put together by Snoop Dogg.
4370860	4372780	They know who their audience is.
4372780	4378180	So there's a post on Twitter right now
4378620	4382380	saying the leaker who posted Starfield gameplay has been arrested for theft.
4382420	4385660	Looks like he stole the Xbox Series X constellation edition
4385900	4387940	of Starfield from the warehouse.
4389020	4391020	Not good. Not good.
4391620	4394940	Yeah. And he went and leaked the gameplay.
4395540	4397620	Yeah, that's that's where it gets bold.
4398380	4401500	And he put up a response video said, Todd, no offense, man.
4401500	4402780	That's a good game. Yeah. Yeah.
4402780	4404500	That's what the questions were just put in chat.
4404500	4408900	It's it's not just that he said that, but apparently he was smoking
4408900	4412900	some of the other substance in the video and then was like, that's a good game.
4412900	4417100	Todd, like there it you can be nice about it, but you still stole it.
4418300	4419660	That's yeah.
4419660	4422220	I just still think that's a funny, you know, end cap.
4422220	4425700	It is what's it's also kind of one of those like I
4426500	4428540	I wonder if the dude's a little troubled,
4428780	4432740	you know, to be so bold for some of it, like it almost strikes me
4432740	4437140	as a call for attention and help like and that's where this kind of gets less funny
4437140	4440540	is it's you know, how much of this was doing it for the profit
4440540	4443620	and how much of it was doing it for some type of.
4445020	4447940	Acknowledgement or something, you know, it's just it's unfortunate.
4448820	4452020	Anyway, in brighter news,
4452460	4455020	maybe in the legal world, I don't know what to think of this.
4455340	4457220	But Loki. Yeah.
4457220	4461820	So as I guess an additional step to try to get past the whole
4462540	4466460	UK regulatory boards, the Competition and Markets Authority,
4467060	4471980	Microsoft has announced that they are going to be partnering with Ubisoft
4471980	4475180	plus to stream their
4476180	4479060	will hopefully acquired Activision games
4479860	4481900	upon completion of the merger.
4481940	4486340	So they made a deal with them for 15 years.
4486900	4491780	And I think also I think they can also renegotiate that later.
4492780	4496780	But it's yeah, basically allowing them to.
4497180	4500460	So they're not exclusively going to be on the Microsoft platforms,
4500460	4505300	I think is what the main goal of that is basically saying, yeah, this is
4506620	4509580	to address the concerns and impact of the proposed acquisition
4509580	4514580	on cloud gaming or cloud game streaming raised by the UK competitive
4514580	4515700	and markets authority.
4515700	4521300	We are restructuring the transaction to acquire a narrower, narrower set of rights.
4521540	4525020	This includes excluding or executing an agreement effective
4525020	4528660	at the closing of our merger that transfers the cloud streaming rights
4528660	4533220	for all current and new Activision, Blizzard, PC and console games
4533220	4536340	released over the next 15 years to Ubisoft.
4537100	4542060	A leading global game publisher, the rights will be in perpetuity,
4542340	4545180	so they're giving them the rights for any of the games that are coming
4545180	4546260	within the next 15 years.
4546260	4549140	So I'm wondering, does that mean that they're not going to be streaming
4549820	4553580	those on the cloud service or they're just adding them to that?
4553620	4556980	I'm not I'm curious to see what they were being added to it,
4556980	4560180	that it was something that the Ubisoft plus platform
4560420	4564020	be able to integrate, just like because they already have the deals with
4564020	4569620	some of the other cloud companies over there in the UK for that stuff.
4569660	4572660	So I want to say Amazon's was one of them and
4574340	4575900	some of the other big ones over there,
4575900	4578660	the one the one that Dark Sakura used to use before she switched.
4578700	4579660	I can't remember the name of it.
4580860	4583260	You know what would be funny is they they make you're a gamer.
4583500	4586340	No, they make that the UK streaming site.
4586340	4588260	You like them. Oh, Boosteroid.
4588260	4589940	That's it. Boosteroid. That was it.
4589940	4590820	I couldn't remember the name.
4590820	4595380	It'd be it'd be funny if like the whole this is like a big trick.
4595460	4597860	And, you know, basically you're saying, oh, yeah, we're going to give the rights
4597860	4601500	to Ubisoft plus, you know, in perpetuity to have this.
4601500	4604780	And then they've already made a deal with Ubisoft to include the Ubisoft
4604780	4607660	plus as part of Game Pass, like that would be funny.
4607660	4611220	Who's somebody more problematic than us that we can give the rights to?
4612620	4615020	I mean, this is this is just it's a Hail Mary play.
4615180	4616380	They this this is it.
4616380	4620340	This is the one thing that's standing between them and getting this deal
4620380	4623140	to go through and they know it hinges on cloud stuff.
4623140	4624380	And so they're like, you know what?
4624380	4627380	We're going to go to our one of our biggest competitors.
4627380	4629180	Like it was it was this or EA.
4629180	4631020	And I don't think EA is set up in this.
4631020	4633180	I don't think Origin does the cloud stuff.
4633180	4636460	So they went over to Ubisoft and said, look,
4637020	4640860	we're willing to literally give it to you so we can have all this other stuff.
4642740	4645820	You know, because maybe they're still thinking cloud gaming
4645820	4648060	isn't even going to take over still for 15 years.
4648540	4649620	You know, probably.
4649620	4653820	I mean, maybe it kind of depends on 5G and a lot of that, I think.
4653820	4655380	But, you know, I digress a little bit.
4657060	4658580	It is definitely a Hail Mary play.
4658580	4660780	Like they want this to go through and this is this is
4661060	4664140	they're doing the most that they can do to make this happen.
4664820	4667860	Basically. Yeah. Yeah.
4668180	4671780	Let's see. Quest Buster says you can almost hear Activision
4671780	4677060	Blizzard's lawyers grunting as they hurled this as far as they could to the end zone.
4677380	4681420	I mean, typically sports references are lost on me, but that one I get.
4681420	4683900	And yes, this it's very that
4685340	4688980	this is very much a.
4688980	4691620	You know, go go long type of thing.
4692940	4693380	All right.
4694180	4697180	Speaking of things in the Microsoft world, you know, there's another game
4697180	4699260	we haven't really been talking about enough on this show.
4699260	4701180	I just think it hasn't
4701180	4703380	been a game we've been playing yet.
4703380	4706860	I know it's something I plan to jump into probably when I'm back from DragonCon.
4707380	4709700	But I've watched a lot of my friends streaming this one.
4709700	4711860	And this is Baldur's Gate three.
4711860	4713740	And apparently it is very, very good.
4713740	4717620	And it's supposed to release on PlayStation on September six.
4717620	4719100	That'll be out on PlayStation five.
4719100	4721820	But it wasn't going to release on Xbox.
4722020	4724460	But that was magically resolved this week.
4724460	4727540	It sounds like it honestly sounds like at Gamescom,
4727820	4732180	Larian Studios and Phil Spencer like sat down like this isn't confirmed.
4732540	4735820	But like you just really get that vibe that Phil Spencer was like.
4736220	4737700	How do we make this happen?
4737700	4738940	We're going to do it.
4738940	4740340	How do we make this happen?
4740340	4743420	And the answer to how did they make this happen was basically
4743860	4747500	give us an exception that we do not have to grant feature parody
4747500	4749380	on the Xbox Series S.
4749380	4751780	And that exception was granted.
4751780	4753940	Games that release on Xbox Series X
4754180	4759020	must also run with feature parody on the Xbox Series S.
4759340	4764020	This game will get an exception to that waiver and cross
4764700	4768900	a split screen, excuse me, split screen multiplayer is the feature
4769060	4773940	that they could not get working with the appropriate amount of quality on the S.
4774100	4775740	So it will be cut.
4775740	4778140	But they are saying they are going out of their way to say
4778140	4780980	it still has cloud based storage and all this.
4781060	4783820	So they're like, it still has everything else you can.
4783820	4786700	If you started a game on S, you can still transfer it somewhere else later.
4786700	4788060	You won't be losing your progress.
4788060	4792820	But still, I know people that game on series S that will probably be sad.
4792860	4793780	In fact, there it is.
4793780	4795300	Dark Tetsuya says, I mean,
4795300	4798340	hate to lose couch co-op because we love gaming together,
4798500	4800380	but we'll definitely look out for this.
4800380	4803660	Well, for what it's worth, I mean, you'd have to spend the money, which sucks.
4803660	4809020	But you could one of you on the series S and one of you on the computer
4809020	4811500	and play, you know, across the Internet.
4811500	4813820	But it's not the same.
4813820	4818380	But, well, yeah, people have completely turned me off of that game.
4818820	4820260	Oh, really? Yeah.
4820260	4824660	Just all of the thirst on the Internet and all the oh, sexy scenes, blah, blah.
4824660	4826700	I'm like, I'm not interested. Pass.
4826700	4829060	Well, there is that, but there's a lot more.
4829620	4834740	I know there's more to it, but it's just all of the the hoopla about it
4834740	4836580	just completely turned me off of it.
4836580	4837540	I'm not interested.
4837540	4842260	I mean, I would rather play second edition D&D with my friends at the table.
4842420	4847740	To me, I would say like Mass Effect, you know, especially with the first game,
4848060	4851180	those sex scenes had a lot of attention in the very beginning,
4851180	4854540	because remember what was on Fox News and all this stuff about, oh, my God,
4854540	4857740	you can fuck an alien because of Liara and all this stuff.
4858220	4861420	And it and it was gay alien, too, because femshep could,
4861420	4864460	even though Liara's race doesn't have jet.
4864460	4868300	But anyway, it's it was still everybody was losing their goddamn minds.
4868300	4870300	And then it's it's there.
4870940	4873260	But yeah, but I came into Mass Effect much later.
4873540	4875740	That is true. That is true. Yeah. Yeah.
4875900	4879340	And. It's just like
4880340	4885620	there is way too much focus on those aspects in games that for,
4885780	4890020	you know, people who like, no, I just want a good, solid game
4890020	4895180	with a good, solid story, and I don't need that to advertise it to me, you know?
4895220	4898580	And I'm not saying, you know, oh, be prudes and blah, blah, blah.
4898820	4902700	I'm just saying that for me as an ace person, it completely turned me off.
4903220	4907660	Well, Questbuster hears you in chat saying as someone that plays BG3,
4907660	4911420	I'm also tired of seeing so many people gravitating towards the thirst, too,
4911620	4915060	because there's so much more to do other than that. So, yeah.
4915940	4918060	All right. Well, let's move on to a console.
4918060	4921900	You definitely can't play Baldur's Gate three on, but still might be kind of fun.
4923700	4926340	What you mean the one I probably have a couple of of them?
4926900	4930500	Well, this particular one's a little new, but yeah, I get what you're saying.
4931500	4939900	There is going to be a recreation of the Atari 2600
4939900	4942060	and all of its wood paneled glory
4943620	4949180	to be released. It plays games from the 2600 and 7800 consoles.
4949220	4951140	Why not the 5200?
4951140	4952540	I mean, they are bigger cartridges.
4952540	4955700	And you just answered it because that was out there on Twitter.
4955740	4959300	They answered it. It's that. I figured. Yeah, that's OK.
4959300	4961100	I have two of those
4961900	4964940	with controllers notorious for breaking.
4965700	4969340	But anyway, the 2600 plus is got the,
4969340	4972500	you know, the the late 70s, early 80s wood grain.
4973220	4977100	And it's based off of the four switch model.
4978300	4984420	It has a reproduction CX40 controller and supports USB power and HDMI.
4985540	4988020	The logo on it lights up
4988500	4991340	and it has a 10 in one cartridge
4991340	4996340	that has some pretty notable classic games.
4999700	5004820	So if if for people who've wanted to know
5004820	5010380	if it's original hardware, like using FPGA or if it's emulation,
5012020	5015380	it's been vague.
5018260	5021060	So. It's.
5022460	5024420	Most of the games are compatible,
5025340	5029220	so you should be able just to plug in your your cartridge.
5031140	5034260	And. It's a.
5035780	5040540	It's it's going to be something that you can plug in on an HD screen
5040540	5043380	and not have the same input like you would using
5044380	5051140	like a modified route through an RF out or or
5052020	5056660	an or composite, because there are the composite mods for the 2600 already.
5058220	5060460	But it'll be it'll be good.
5060460	5065540	And also Atari is producing new titles
5066220	5069060	for the old consoles, so that's something there.
5069940	5072460	It's supposed to ship in November this year,
5072500	5076540	and it looks like it's going to sell for one hundred and twenty nine ninety nine.
5077100	5079580	And you know what?
5079580	5082380	Um, I'm curious. I'm curious.
5083500	5088020	So I'm looking at the list of games that have been tested with it.
5089820	5092380	There are I'm not seeing any.
5093260	5098540	OK, one game that's failed a super cobra out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
5098540	5102380	isn't isn't working, you know, just for competition with game.
5102980	5106460	They're but most of the ones put in there have passed
5106460	5110420	and there's a few untested left to left to try.
5111220	5115540	So and on top of that, that Texas Chainsaw Massacre game was like not
5116340	5118940	like fully legit, so.
5121140	5123980	You know, I will say, though, this 2600 plus is
5124860	5128900	it's it's more interesting than the Atari VCS thing they were trying,
5128900	5131740	which I guess is still technically a thing that whole.
5132220	5135180	I have almost said high end computer, and it wasn't even that.
5135460	5138060	It was just a computer that was branded Atari.
5138300	5141540	This sounds more interesting because at least it leans into the shit
5141540	5142980	that Atari is known for.
5142980	5146380	I like the fact that it's twenty six hundred and seventy eight hundred.
5146380	5149420	Like it's I understand why they had to leave out the fifty two hundred.
5149420	5151700	But I think it's it's interesting to me.
5152940	5153540	That's one hundred.
5153540	5156060	Matt and Chad says most people want to be able to plug and play
5156060	5158380	without having to jump through conversion boxes, et cetera,
5158380	5160900	to make it work on new TVs. I'm kind of in that boat.
5160900	5162740	I have a lot of my old Atari cartridges,
5162740	5165420	but don't really have an old CRT TV to play it on. Yeah.
5165660	5169540	I I still worry the price they're asking is a little high,
5169540	5172340	especially when you put it next to like the flashback consoles.
5172340	5175380	Now, look, I know the flashbacks run on emulation.
5175620	5179340	You know, it's it's maybe a different level of collection purity for people.
5179340	5180220	I don't know.
5180220	5184740	But that's my one concern is I feel like the price might be a little high.
5184940	5188660	But maybe maybe the if the thing is fucking
5188700	5190700	sturdy like an old Atari was,
5190700	5193300	then maybe maybe I'm not giving it enough credit, you know.
5195460	5198420	So we'll see.
5198420	5201220	Of what Rob?
5201220	5202660	I was going to say, if you think about it,
5202660	5207740	the original cost of the Atari twenty six hundred was one hundred
5207740	5211900	and eighty nine ninety five, which as of two thousand
5211900	5215620	twenty two would be the equivalent equivalent of nine hundred and twenty dollars.
5216620	5220220	So technically you're getting this cheaper than the original.
5221260	5223940	But if the original hardware is still in this thing,
5223940	5228340	which is still under debate, I guess so.
5228980	5231340	But it's it's interesting. I mean, don't get me wrong.
5231340	5235500	I still kind of maybe want one like I just I do love retro games
5235500	5236860	and I love that stuff.
5236860	5240420	I don't think I have a lot of Atari twenty six hundred cartridges anymore.
5240740	5245140	I mean, and I like I couldn't lend you a handful of them or a box full.
5245380	5248660	And they're usually pretty easy to find at like estate sales
5248660	5249740	and garage sales and stuff.
5249740	5251700	Most people don't really know the value of them.
5251700	5254740	And there's but I the only interesting thing is, I wonder
5254740	5258060	if machines like this that will now play the games all over again.
5258220	5261140	I wonder if it'll actually cause the cost of some cartridges to go up.
5261540	5264100	I don't know. It could be interesting. Maybe. Yeah.
5264660	5265740	So. All right.
5265740	5270700	Well, let's move on to another console that was announced this week.
5270980	5273140	Oh, gosh, this thing looks stupid.
5273180	5276700	I mean, honestly, it's so it's a PlayStation five.
5276700	5279900	They're remote gameplay console.
5279900	5281740	It's called the PlayStation Portal.
5281740	5284220	It is for the PlayStation five.
5284220	5288980	It allows you to do the remote play with it, and it's two hundred dollars.
5289500	5291820	So here's the fun things they can't do.
5291820	5296900	One, it you can only use PlayStation
5299180	5301380	Bluetooth headphones with it.
5301380	5303940	You cannot use your own Bluetooth headphones with it.
5304740	5307300	It does have a three point five millimeter audio jack,
5307300	5310220	so you can plug in your own headphones if you have those.
5310500	5312740	Thanks. How gracious of you.
5312740	5315340	It only works over Wi-Fi.
5315940	5318340	And I think you have to be.
5320580	5323700	You have, of course, you have to have your PlayStation five connected
5323700	5327340	and plugged in, turned on, connected to the Internet in order to do that.
5327660	5331100	It's just it's a very, very narrow use case.
5331420	5334220	For this one, you know.
5334220	5338220	I'm pretty sure a steam deck can run PlayStation
5338780	5342060	streaming as well, for at least on PC.
5342340	5346660	And then on top of that, like it can't play games natively.
5346660	5349020	You have to be connected to a PlayStation five.
5349420	5351860	It just doesn't seem very well.
5351860	5355660	And they even have things for your cell phone where you can get
5356140	5359220	basically a controller that straps to your cell phone
5359220	5361700	that allows you to kind of create something similar to this
5361980	5364220	without buying a dedicated device. So.
5366380	5368900	I don't really understand what this is for.
5371260	5375300	Yeah, I don't know about this.
5376340	5379220	It's it's a little too many, a few too many restrictions for me.
5379220	5383660	Like I feel I feel like they're like trying to capitalize on the switch,
5383940	5387860	but not understanding what makes the switch so popular.
5388860	5392660	Like, yeah, it's it's also ugly looking, too, like it's a big, huge
5392660	5395540	it's like a tablet with controllers stuck to the side.
5395540	5397180	That part doesn't bother me nearly as much.
5397180	5399460	Like, I think it's just one of those things where it's like the whole fact
5399460	5403820	that it it has no memory or way to play the game
5404460	5406300	unless you're still in your own house.
5406300	5410180	Like, I feel like it limits the use case so bad
5410980	5414340	because, you know, with the Nintendo Switch, you can play it in a car
5414580	5418860	or a bus or public transit or a plane or going anywhere, you know,
5418860	5421500	or a hotel room like it's just so damn convenient.
5421500	5422860	You can pick it up and take it anywhere.
5422860	5425340	This doesn't really let you do that.
5425660	5428500	Now, maybe if it had some type of.
5430260	5433140	Connection where you could tap into the hotel's Wi-Fi
5433140	5436460	and play your PS5 at home on Wi-Fi, I don't think it would be very good.
5436820	5438980	But but you can't even really do that.
5439780	5442220	I just I'm just not sure who the hell this is for.
5442620	5444980	Yeah, they say that you can do it with
5446260	5449620	as a connection, as slow as five megabits per second.
5449660	5454580	But they recommend 15, which I think for most hotel Wi-Fi,
5454980	5458700	you probably could get get around that like that would probably be fine.
5459140	5461780	But once again, you know, you have to have your PlayStation
5461780	5464580	powered up and stuff, and it's not going to be still.
5465580	5468100	As good as like playing on the actual thing,
5468100	5470700	I just don't see the point of like carrying this with me.
5470700	5472460	It would be such a cumbersome thing.
5472460	5475540	I would think for your money, you may be spending a little bit more
5475740	5478420	to get something like that, but probably a steam deck.
5478420	5481100	Honestly, a steam deck, I think, could probably run
5481860	5485100	the PlayStation streaming stuff if they still have that for PC.
5485100	5488100	I thought that that was still a thing they used to have a little while ago.
5488100	5492140	But if you can still do that via PC,
5492140	5495020	then why would I buy this dedicated thing that can only this?
5495020	5500300	And then once you stop playing, your PlayStation five is just garbage.
5500380	5501780	It's e-waste at that point.
5501780	5503980	You can't use it for anything.
5503980	5506460	So no, no, thanks.
5506820	5510300	All right. So so Shane is in chat right now with a well, actually,
5510740	5514940	who is saying for me, my PlayStation five is downstairs.
5514940	5516700	I like to play in bed upstairs.
5516700	5518700	This negates having to lug it back and forth.
5518940	5520540	But that screen worries me.
5520540	5525220	I just like I get it for you specifically, but I still feel like it's
5525500	5528980	there's not enough people with those types of use cases
5528980	5533460	to justify this thing being a success unless the expectations
5533460	5537180	are really low for this thing, which maybe they are. I don't know.
5537620	5540580	I, I feel like and maybe I'm wrong,
5541100	5545620	but Sony's time would have been better spent making a portable PlayStation four
5546460	5551100	that actually can carry your digital PlayStation four library with you
5551300	5554940	or something where like the disk, if it's your PS4, you can like
5555140	5558500	have a temporary version of it on your device.
5558500	5561380	You can take it with you, so to speak, like a way to do that.
5561380	5564820	Like, I still feel like that would be far more interesting than.
5564820	5567740	And the reason why I say PS4 is because I realize
5567740	5571500	the portable tech is probably too expensive to do a PlayStation five.
5571660	5573220	But let's take it back to the last gen.
5573220	5576460	Yeah. And there are even like a lot of PS4 games
5576460	5578540	and a lot of stuff to play on it.
5578540	5582300	I just are just a souped up PlayStation TV again.
5582300	5584580	Like, you know, that was Vita tech at one point.
5584580	5586700	And you could do streaming that way.
5587020	5588700	Like, just do something like that.
5588700	5590260	That's far less expensive.
5590260	5592220	Like, it doesn't even have to have a portable screen.
5592220	5593780	You just have it hooked up to a TV.
5593780	5595140	I just think it's.
5595460	5598060	I just don't see the point of this, like
5598060	5601660	considering that everybody like, do you not have a cell phone?
5601660	5602980	I mean, like a lot of people have cell phones.
5602980	5606740	I think it would be a lot easier just to get a cell phone device
5606740	5613260	and buy a controller or I'm pretty sure they even sell one already for this.
5613260	5614620	Like buy their controller.
5614620	5618660	That's probably sub $100 and just strap it to your cell phone
5618660	5621580	because at the very least, you know, that's a controller.
5622020	5625220	It would be even better if that controller could work separately,
5625220	5629460	as well as like a DualSense controller with the PlayStation
5630820	5632540	and just have that type of thing.
5632540	5634900	Or you could even like, you know,
5634900	5637380	I don't know what other solutions they have with that.
5637380	5640220	But this seems like ridiculous looking for one.
5640220	5642860	And it's not the first time that someone's put out something like this
5642860	5645140	to try to capitalize on streaming there.
5645140	5648700	There's other devices, I think, from like Razer or Nvidia
5648700	5652180	or something like that, that were only streaming cloud streaming devices.
5652420	5653940	But they worked with multiple platforms.
5653940	5655940	Like this worked for like, say,
5657380	5658660	for PlayStation five streaming.
5658660	5664820	It also worked for xCloud and whatever else, you know, like Nvidia's thing.
5665140	5667060	You know, that might be more worth it.
5667060	5671620	But if it's just PlayStation five, it's $200.
5671620	5673660	That's ridiculous.
5673660	5675980	Well, even though Shane gave us a case where he would use it,
5675980	5678820	he does say in chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network.
5679020	5680500	Nope, it wouldn't be a success.
5680500	5682820	And the form factor is ugly as all get out.
5682820	5686820	And I'm used to OLED on my mobile devices now, so that's a decent downgrade.
5688020	5690180	Well, I mean, it's a it's a decent form factor,
5690180	5693620	like if you were to put your own tablet in there or something like that.
5693620	5696860	Once again, they have I they literally sell this.
5697180	5703940	That is a device that you can hook up to your phone or tablet, I think even.
5704380	5705820	And it works exactly like this.
5705820	5707660	And you can just stream that way.
5707660	5710300	I mean, because I think even like streaming through mobile
5710300	5715620	or using like your mobile phone to do the cloud streaming with PlayStation,
5715620	5717300	you can use any controller with that.
5717300	5719700	I don't think you're limited to just Sony controllers.
5720100	5722020	At least that's not the way it is with.
5722020	5724340	I think some of the other streaming services, so it would.
5724340	5728300	Cool, cool that they're making this, who's this for?
5728300	5731860	I don't know, like, did they really test their markets with this?
5731860	5734300	I mean, it just doesn't seem like it makes sense.
5734620	5736540	Hopefully they end up in a bargain bin soon.
5738260	5742460	All right. Well, let's let's travel back to a simpler time in our next segment
5742460	5748220	where maybe you don't have these devices that are portable,
5748220	5749980	but they're not actually portable at all.
5749980	5752780	I have no idea how else to a tangent into this segment.
5752820	5754340	So we're just going to roll the bumper.
5764820	5768780	And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive
5768780	5772220	into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.
5772580	5775340	It's time for the classic game of the week.
5775940	5780900	And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight for the classic game of the week?
5781820	5784540	I picked a game that when it was first announced,
5784540	5788540	I super, super, super wanted to play the full version of it.
5788980	5792740	And they had one at California Extreme two weeks ago.
5792740	5796500	So I'm finally doing F355 Challenge.
5797620	5802220	It is a racing simulation arcade game
5803540	5808460	that's based off of the car and the official Ferrari challenge.
5808980	5813700	It was developed by AM2 of Sega for the Sega Naomi multiboard
5813700	5818180	arcade system board, and it was directed by Yu Suzuki
5818780	5822500	and was later ported over to the Dreamcast and PlayStation two.
5823700	5829380	The Dreamcast one was called F355 Challenge
5829700	5835180	Passione Rossa and PlayStation two was Ferrari F355 Challenge
5836100	5839060	for the American and European markets.
5839980	5845740	The only model of a car in the game is a Ferrari F355,
5845980	5848100	which is, of course, from the challenge itself.
5848580	5855580	And it was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 at that time.
5856940	5861140	Some of the arcade cabinets, there's some different builds of them.
5861140	5865420	The one that I was most interested in was the three screen model,
5866180	5869980	which now, you know, you'd hardly see a home sim racing rig
5869980	5873060	that doesn't have a three screen dance had a three screen.
5875620	5879300	But it also has an eight
5879300	5886340	shaped gear shift and three foot pedals, and it's
5887260	5889780	I've played it now, of course,
5889780	5893300	but it basically is as close to its time
5893300	5895940	in arcade simulation of being in a Ferrari as you could get.
5897300	5900540	It was composed of four Naomi units,
5900900	5903380	one for each of the screens and one to sync them.
5905020	5909140	The game does have automatic transition and pedal shift gears.
5910540	5913980	Another notable thing about it is that it uses the magic weather system
5914140	5917100	that was similar to what eventually came out in Shinmu as well.
5917740	5921500	And for the Dreamcast version, it has link cable play
5921740	5924020	that you can so you can play directly with other people.
5924820	5931940	But as of 2006, the online servers for F355 challenge are offline.
5931940	5932940	In fact, the website's gone.
5934260	5935820	Soundtrack is pretty, pretty good.
5935820	5938980	It was supposed to sound like sort of 80s, you know, heavy metal,
5938980	5943940	but it was put in the way like a radio station would be kind of outrun like,
5943940	5949700	you know, and the music was done by Genki Hitomi and Minoru Nihara.
5950140	5956100	And it even had it's a radio announcer that was played by Alan Jay,
5956100	5960860	who is an American DJ who works for Bay FM
5962140	5964940	in Chiba in Japan.
5966740	5971860	So there were different circuits in there for the arcade version.
5971900	5975860	You had the Motegi Oval Circuit,
5976500	5982780	which is a motorsport venue in Motegi, Tochigi Prefecture.
5983260	5985180	It was originally called Twin Ring Motegi.
5985700	5989700	And then you have the two Suzuka tracks.
5989700	5991700	And yes, it's that Suzuka.
5993500	5999020	It is the short configuration and the full configuration.
5999660	6006460	There is the Monza, which is actually north of Milan in Italy.
6007060	6010180	And this is the 1998 configuration.
6011140	6014860	There is a Sugo as in Sportsland Sugo,
6014860	6018940	which is a motorsports facility in Murata, Shibata district.
6020820	6024540	There's also the Grand Prix of Long Beach.
6024540	6027580	It's an IndyCar series race,
6027620	6030580	but they use the track for that, the Long Beach track.
6031540	6036300	The home console versions also had five extra unlockable circuits.
6036780	6040220	There was the Atlanta Motor Speedway,
6041380	6045260	as in the Hampton, Georgia version.
6046860	6049660	There's Nurburgring,
6049660	6052420	which, of course, you can't have a racing game without Nurburgring.
6053420	6060420	Laguna Seca, which is one in central California around Monterey, I believe.
6061140	6065860	There's Seppang, which is a Malaysian track.
6066420	6071380	And then there's Fiorano, which the special thing about Fiorano
6071380	6074140	is that it is the private
6074580	6078060	racetrack that's owned by Ferrari for development and testing.
6078060	6085500	So, yeah, you can unlock those by either finishing in certain positions
6085500	6087500	in a certain race or championship
6087500	6092060	or driving over a certain cumulative distance in the race
6092500	6093660	or by entering a password.
6095860	6099780	The tracks are also included in F355 Challenge 2
6100100	6103660	International Course Edition arcade machine that came out in 2001.
6104900	6107540	This game was announced at E3 2000.
6108820	6114700	The reception was kind of mixed.
6115500	6122700	So, Pasha and Rosa, which was the Dreamcast one, got really favorable reviews,
6122700	6126220	but the PlayStation 2 one got average reviews.
6128460	6132580	Basically, we're saying that it's pretty eye candy
6133820	6137860	and very, very dedicated to Ferrari fans.
6139060	6144380	For the console version, Famitsu gave it 29 out of 40
6144700	6147980	for the Dreamcast and 27 out of 40 for PlayStation.
6149100	6150980	The arcade version
6153140	6157900	in Japan, Game Machine listed it in their January 1st 2000 issue
6157900	6161900	as the seventh most successful dedicated arcade game of the past year.
6162500	6167020	And the arcade version also won the award for Coin Op of the Year
6167060	6168820	at EDGE Awards 2000.
6169140	6174460	And Pasha and Rosa was the runner up in GameSpot's best driving game.
6174740	6178420	The first one, by the way, the winner was Test Drive Le Mans.
6179100	6182940	And at the fourth annual Interactive Achievement Awards,
6183220	6187100	the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences
6187100	6192060	nominated F355 Challenge for the console racing award,
6192060	6194700	although SSX won it that year.
6194700	6201260	But overall, the the arcade version just got all kinds of accolades.
6201260	6202820	And for the home version,
6202820	6208060	the Dreamcast fared much better than the PlayStation 2.
6208380	6212180	Of course, if you think about it, Dreamcast is a home now, me.
6212740	6216340	So, yeah. And that's it.
6216420	6220100	All right. Oh, that's the Suzuka track right there.
6220220	6223060	Yeah, this is you know what this game kind of reminds me of?
6223300	6225940	Number one, I love the billboards for Pocari Sweat.
6225940	6227980	That is definitely something I love.
6228620	6230220	Dan's gotten addicted to that, by the way.
6230860	6236140	But also, I love this really reminds me of like a modern day poll.
6236300	6238780	Well, I say modern day, even though it's 2001.
6238980	6242940	But like poll position, you know, like, I don't know what it is,
6242940	6245020	but it just gives me those big poll position vibes,
6245020	6247100	maybe because it's simplistic.
6247100	6250100	And that's not a bad thing, because, you know, when you're driving fast cars,
6250340	6253100	you oftentimes, you know, want to drive them.
6253460	6254900	You know, I don't know.
6254900	6257300	It's just it kind of gives you a poll position vibes a little bit.
6258020	6259100	Yeah, no, for sure.
6259100	6262020	Oh, and one other thing that I should mention, the music in the game,
6262380	6264500	some of it found its way into Shenmue.
6265100	6266260	Oh, that's fun.
6266260	6268620	I mean, they're both AM2 games.
6268700	6270660	So I guess it makes sense.
6270660	6272980	All right. Awesome. Awesome.
6272980	6276380	All right. Well, we have a few more things for you guys.
6276380	6278660	We're going to invite your phone calls here in a little while as well
6278660	6282140	on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6282140	6286300	But first, some rapid fire quick headlines, and we'll start with Loki.
6289180	6290300	I think you're muted, Loki.
6290300	6294500	I think you maybe know if I hit the button and it didn't quite engage.
6294540	6297220	OK, so this is kind of cool.
6297220	6303740	So the Xbox Series X is going to be getting some brand new wraps.
6303740	6306860	And so these are kind of like skins for consoles,
6307100	6311580	but they're magnetic and kind of fold around it and are held in place by a magnet.
6311580	6314700	So, of course, some of the first wraps that we're going to be getting
6314700	6318220	for the Xbox Series X are based around Starfield.
6318580	6323100	And so they have a Starfield version, which is $49.99.
6323100	6328300	They also have a blue and white wrap that I think it was a camo.
6328580	6333420	And that is for $44.99, a bit on the expensive side,
6333420	6335220	but they are pretty cool looking.
6335260	6339020	And yeah, I have to see what other things they come out with.
6339020	6343500	But yeah, for sure, I want to get one for my console if it wasn't in a box.
6345420	6352500	The wraps are supposed to be coming out on October 18th, at least the Starfield one is.
6352780	6356420	And then the other wraps will launch November 10th.
6357540	6359980	So and they're made out of vinyl.
6362060	6363020	This is kind of neat.
6363020	6368260	So, you know, everyone loves Half-Life 2 and Nvidia announced that there's going
6368260	6374900	to be a Half-Life 2 RTX version, which is in early development right now.
6375140	6380060	But it's using their RTX remix platform to basically
6380980	6386940	mod in higher definition models and ray tracing and all that stuff.
6387060	6388860	That's what they do with Portal not that long ago, right?
6389780	6390420	Right. Yeah.
6390460	6393900	So it makes sense that they're going to do the same with another source engine game.
6393900	6399540	So that is going to be coming at some point soon, I think.
6399580	6400740	Well, early development.
6400740	6402740	OK, maybe not so soon.
6402740	6405540	Eventually will be coming out some day.
6405540	6410500	Sooner, sooner than the, you know, the ray tracing update for Minecraft.
6410540	6412500	Sooner than Elder Scrolls six.
6414220	6415140	Much, yes.
6416620	6417220	Dark Saga.
6417220	6425900	Well, there are warnings coming with the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume One.
6427260	6433140	And it's a warning that we see on like older, you know, Looney Tunes cartoons and the like.
6434340	6435900	I'll go ahead and read what it says.
6436100	6440020	This game contains expressions and themes which may be considered outdated.
6440300	6444660	However, these elements have been included without alteration to preserve the historical
6444660	6447740	context in which the game was made and the creator's original vision.
6448060	6450020	Player discretion is advised.
6450220	6453580	Of course, they said the same thing with Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection.
6453900	6457940	So, I mean, I think it's just a cover your ass kind of thing.
6459260	6462340	I didn't know that there were going to be boobs in this game.
6462340	6464580	I didn't know they were talking about war.
6464940	6467980	How dare you push smoking.
6467980	6473180	Yeah, and I don't remember those games that thoroughly, so I don't know what, quote unquote,
6473660	6477140	you know, problematic things might have shown up in the game that don't.
6477140	6480260	Walking in on Meryl in her underwear.
6480500	6483900	Maybe or just things that don't look good in 2023.
6483900	6485460	You know, society's changed.
6485460	6487260	So it is what it is. Yeah.
6489340	6493820	I mean, a similar warning that should be on old episodes of the show, quite frankly, you know,
6493820	6498900	it's that the humor 20 years ago is different than the humor now, and, you know, it's what it is.
6499580	6501580	So. Yep.
6501580	6508660	All right. One other, you know, this classic hasn't changed at all is Excite Bike 64.
6508940	6513780	That's right. Excite Bike 64 is on its way to Nintendo Switch online on August 30th.
6513780	6519860	So later this week, this is it's nice to hear about games getting added to Nintendo Switch online again.
6519860	6522380	I guess opening up these new platforms really did do something.
6522620	6528900	But yeah, Excite Bike 64 is on its way out and that will be fun for those that remember that game fondly.
6528900	6531220	Sorry, Loki. No word about Excite Truck.
6531900	6532900	I guess it's all right.
6532900	6534700	They're not the Wii games yet.
6534700	6537180	Once they start doing Wii games, they'll be one of the first ones.
6537180	6541060	I'm pretty sure because it's surely, you know, it's got to be.
6541420	6543660	And then they'll be glorious times again.
6545140	6547780	Except they'll do Excite Bots trick racing instead.
6548460	6552540	And everyone will be like, Oh, that's not what I meant.
6552580	6554940	I mean, not like this.
6554940	6557300	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
6557300	6561500	and some things that are coming out sooner than Wii games on Nintendo Switch.
6561500	6562980	What's coming out in the US this week?
6562980	6565180	Loki, we have a few things.
6565180	6569740	So we have Crossfire Sierra Squad on PC and PlayStation five.
6570180	6574700	Goodbye, Volcano High on PC, PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
6575140	6580700	Rhapsody, Moral Kingdom Chronicles on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation five.
6581060	6584380	Samba de Amigo Party Central on Nintendo Switch.
6585380	6589740	Sea of Stars on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation four, PlayStation five,
6589740	6594620	Xbox one and Xbox series under the waves on PC, PlayStation four,
6594620	6597420	PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6597980	6603740	Daymare are I guess it's like nightmare, but Daymare 1994 Sandcastle.
6603940	6607220	That is quite the collection of words and numbers there.
6607740	6612300	That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6612780	6617380	The big con on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
6617940	6621420	Oi on PC and Nintendo Switch.
6622140	6625620	Somerville on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
6625780	6628700	Taito Milestones two on Nintendo Switch.

6651540	6657500	Bomb Rush Cyber Funk on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.
6657700	6659500	Yeah, that looks awesome.
6659500	6666660	Mega Man X Divine Offline on PC, iOS and Android.
6667660	6670260	Rhapsody, Moral Kingdom Chronicles.
6670740	6672340	That's going to be for Europe, actually.
6672340	6674580	So I'm not going to we're not going to talk about that one right now.
6674900	6676180	That's coming out earlier in the week.
6676940	6677460	And that's it.
6679140	6682300	All right, well, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.
6682300	6683940	We have a little bit going on this week.
6683940	6689540	So on the Nintendo Switch on August 30th, Samba de Amigo Party Central is also out in Japan this week.
6689740	6695980	We also have The Legend of the Legend of Heroes, Zero no Kisuke Kai and Ao no Kisuke Kai.
6696460	6699380	I believe these are older games that are being remastered.
6699380	6704540	I think they're about 10 years old now, but they're being remastered with full voice acting and being released for the Switch.
6704540	6706020	So that's pretty cool.
6706020	6711940	We also have on the 31st, Taito Milestones 2, another kind of retro game collection.
6711940	6717780	And I was looking at what games were in this and they have like Kiki Kai Kai, Dino Rex.
6717780	6721900	There's some but they also have like The Legend of Kage, the New Zealand story.
6721900	6726060	So there's some other, you know, a kind of New Zealand story is so cute.
6726060	6729740	Yeah. So this is a very interesting this is a deep dive collection, but it looks pretty cool.
6729740	6731700	So that is out on the Nintendo Switch this week.
6732540	6735860	And then that is apparently also a US release.
6735860	6738380	I didn't catch that, but I'm noticing that is out too.
6738380	6739700	So maybe I'll pick that up.
6739700	6743660	I don't know. And then Moving Out 2 is also out on the Switch.
6743660	6744940	Those are just Switch releases.
6744940	6747900	Let's check out the PlayStation 5 on the PlayStation 5.
6747900	6750700	This week we have Edge of Eternity is out this week.
6751140	6761660	That same Daymare 1994 Sandcastle that Loki was referring to earlier is also out on PlayStation 5 and Moving Out 2 also released on PlayStation 5.
6761860	6763420	And those are your Japanese releases.
6763420	6765980	Let's get over to the UK, Dark Sakura.
6767460	6777180	So on the 29th of August on Xbox, we have Smurfs Kart for Xbox and PlayStation Under the Waves.

6809500	6813060	Also, that's my wedding anniversary of 18 years.
6813380	6814780	Aw, congrats.
6815820	6817300	Thanks. I haven't killed him yet.
6818420	6819700	There's still time. I'm just kidding.
6820300	6821860	No, he's I love my boy.
6822780	6830740	Well, there's still time for that, but we are out of time with Dark Sakura tonight, as I believe you have one more night of early obligations tomorrow.
6830740	6834940	So but you'll be back with us full time when we return in two weeks.
6834980	6841580	So I'll float around in chat for a little bit, but I got to do a lot of winding down before before bedtime.
6841580	6845380	So let me see if I can get my thing to do the hearts.
6845580	6846860	Come on, get up your hand.
6847820	6850100	There we go. Hearts.
6850100	6853260	Well, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
6854100	6856540	I hate getting up any time before 12.
6857660	6858940	OK, maybe 10.
6858940	6861900	All right, we'll see you in two weeks.
6863020	6867020	Oh, don't forget, I'm going to be all day Sunday.
6868380	6869740	All right, come play with me.
6869740	6871260	Check it out. Keep me coming.
6871260	6873540	I can't. I'm busy.
6874260	6876620	You can keep it open on your phone.
6876620	6878780	All right. Bye, everybody.
6878780	6881700	Take care. Have fun storming the castle.
6883180	6884620	That's basically what Dragon Con is.
6884620	6887220	It's storming the castle, except the castle is five hotels.
6887460	6889620	It's what it is. All right.
6889620	6890940	Hi. All right.
6890940	6892540	Let's go back to Loki.
6892540	6895180	Loki, you have some headlines for us.
6895180	6898500	Yeah. So about the GTA six leaker
6899260	6904500	who apparently hacks Broxer with just an Amazon fire stick in a hotel room, they say.
6905100	6907940	So there is some apparently the
6908980	6911540	BBC report had some details
6911540	6915180	regarding court documents that are filed in U.K.
6915180	6917780	talking about 18 year old Arianne
6918500	6922380	Kurtage, who said was was caught red handed
6923100	6925460	when police searched his hotel room.
6925900	6929780	And he's being held on bail because, you know, he was arrested
6930060	6932340	for hacking Nvidia as well.
6932740	6936740	He'd claimed to have downloaded all of GTA six's data
6937060	6939420	and that he was going to release the source code less.
6939420	6942740	Rockstar Games messaged him on telegram
6943140	6946060	and I assume paid him money as well.
6947980	6952340	But yeah, apparently he was part of a hacker group as well called lapses.
6953300	6957140	And I'm not sure how he used the Amazon fire stick
6957140	6960140	necessarily to hack somebody, but
6960140	6963980	somebody, but well, they probably don't want other people to do it,
6963980	6966500	so they're probably keeping it a little bit vague.
6966500	6967740	Right. Yeah, exactly.
6967740	6971500	It could be a key logger or something like that or who knows? I don't know.
6971540	6973260	But you never know.
6973260	6975500	Chat says, wow, that's a lot of laws being broken.
6975500	6977980	It sure is. It sure is.
6977980	6980860	Well, you know, if you're breaking the law, break in the story in the news,
6980860	6983220	the laws. Yeah. Yeah.
6983220	6985460	It's especially like interesting, like you're a hacksmith.
6985460	6986260	You're like, oh, yeah.
6986260	6989780	And and I'm going to get you the payment to not leak your stuff.
6990020	6992860	Yeah, that's that's worked out great for everybody that's done that.
6992860	6997060	Like, nobody has ever not gotten away from that like that.
6997300	7001020	Just like 100 percent of the time you're going to get caught
7001020	7003660	because you're just basically saying, Hey, it was me. I did it.
7003700	7005620	Hey, it's me. You know, like.
7006540	7006980	I did.
7006980	7010340	Rama Esten chat points out you can sideload a terminal app into a fire stick.
7010340	7012420	Yeah, I mean, it can be done.
7012420	7015140	It's just it's yeah, it's just a little surprising, I guess, maybe.
7016420	7019180	Yeah. So, well, it's been caught.
7020340	7021700	Rockstar is going to get, you know,
7021700	7025340	I didn't realize it was the same person that did this and the Nvidia one,
7025340	7028500	because, you know, that one, it was a while ago, but it's still,
7028700	7031740	you know, pretty much everything in that ended up being announced,
7031740	7033700	except for the tactics.
7033700	7035700	Redo is still something that was in that.
7035700	7037420	I think there might be one or two others.
7037420	7039980	And some may be coming. Yeah, it could be.
7041380	7043980	What else? I think you have one other thing for us, right?
7043980	7048500	Yeah. So Bioware is going to be cutting around 50 jobs.
7048500	7052660	They're saying to help the studio become more agile and more focused.
7053540	7056180	They said after much consideration and careful playing,
7056180	7059660	we have built a long term vision that will preserve the health of the studio
7059940	7063460	and better enable us to do what we do best, create exceptional story
7063460	7065700	driven single player experiences, blah, blah, blah.
7067540	7070380	And basically saying, you know, commit that the
7070900	7073460	they're committing to supporting the affected staff.
7073460	7077180	We've chosen to act now in part to provide our impacted colleagues
7077180	7080180	with the many opportunities as possible.
7080180	7083620	I don't know if it's necessarily like I don't know where they cut jobs
7083620	7086300	necessarily with that.
7086300	7088500	Maybe it's just
7088540	7092020	that lay off money or people for
7092900	7095900	projects or overlapping types of things that they're doing.
7096260	7098100	There were some reorganization stuff.
7098100	7101300	So that sucks when people are impacted by that stuff. But.
7102300	7106260	Yeah, it's I mean, I know they were offering
7106260	7109620	to relocate people within EA, and I guess, you know, that's, you know,
7109620	7112220	I guess the least they could do in that type of situation.
7112660	7117020	But I see. OK, so they were several EA sever ties with a studio
7117020	7119380	that was working on Dragon Age Dread Wolf.
7119380	7122220	So I'm guessing it's from that studio then.
7122220	7124900	Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.
7124900	7128940	Shane in chat says no faith in Bioware writing after DA for
7129180	7131300	since I assume that the writing is finished by now.
7131300	7135500	They let go some really senior writers that went all the way back to Baldur's Gate
7135700	7137780	and original Dragon Age of Mass Effect.
7137980	7142780	I'm actually curious who they did let go because I really didn't know.
7142780	7147460	And my initial thought, based on what they're saying in the commitment
7147460	7150300	and all that stuff, was that they talked a lot about single player.
7150300	7155420	And I was wondering, did they take multiplayer out of the games coming up?
7156260	7159460	But it's weird because I thought multiplayer was such a bread and butter for EA
7159460	7160940	like that was really.
7160940	7163460	But then also now you have Baldur's Gate three
7163740	7167100	has really changed like the whole speaking on.
7167100	7169660	You know what? This is what a fully featured game should look like.
7169660	7171820	Although I would say that game is too new.
7172100	7175420	Like this layoff has been in process well before Baldur's Gate
7175420	7178460	three impacted the equation, but it still is interesting.
7178740	7182420	But maybe they're they're trying to like back away from multiplayer
7182420	7184100	after the whole anthem thing.
7184100	7185420	So that was my original thought.
7185420	7188500	But now we're hearing that it's right because Quest Buster in chat says
7188700	7191580	one of the senior writers, Mary Kirby, was let go.
7191580	7195700	She was responsible for characters like Barrick from Dragon Age two.
7195700	7198020	Kirby was with Bioware since 2006.
7198260	7200820	So they're letting writers go?
7200820	7203780	We got chat, JPT, chat, JPT, we'll just write all the lines.
7203780	7206140	It'll be fine. Don't fucking start.
7206140	7210500	We've trained chat, JPT on all of her previous works or wherever,
7210740	7214100	all their works, and I'm sure it'll be it'll do a bang up job
7214100	7216980	getting that dialogue correct.
7216980	7219260	Sorry, I'm going to barf on air.
7220100	7222020	Um, disgusting.
7223700	7224700	Yeah, I just.
7226100	7230580	I is it one of those things where like the new Mass Effect is all already
7230580	7233660	written as well, and this studio is like, well, we're going to not be
7233660	7237020	able to get that game out for another seven years, so we've pretty much
7237020	7238700	got our like 10 year plan now.
7238700	7241340	So, you know, I don't it's it's wild.
7242620	7245740	Shane and chat says you won't recognize the names probably, but some people
7245740	7248180	that wrote some really fantastic characters.
7248420	7251580	The original Canaan writer is gone now, but he was written by another
7251580	7252780	person for Mass Effect three.
7252780	7254580	Wow. That's some.
7255740	7256740	Why the right.
7256740	7261220	I mean, I God, what you said made me like physically ill, but I
7261620	7264100	I worry in a boardroom type set up.
7264820	7267540	There's people that might actually think that
7268140	7271620	because it's what you see happening with the strike right now, right?
7272180	7274460	Like there's they want to replace.
7274460	7278340	Yeah, they want to replace I background actors and writers.
7278340	7279980	Good for them standing their ground.
7279980	7281180	Fuck. Fuck all.
7281180	7284660	I mean, you can try good.
7284780	7286500	You'll see how that ends up.
7286500	7289740	It's not it's nowhere near ready to do that.
7289900	7294260	But you can certainly think that it can and fail. But.
7295980	7296460	I don't know.
7296460	7299340	Shane says the new Mass Effect is like helmed by the writer
7299340	7301460	of Guardians of the Galaxy, so I already have little faith.
7301820	7303300	The movie or the game?
7303300	7305020	Because the game was actually it was good.
7305020	7307700	The game was actually pretty good. So.
7309780	7311460	Yeah, Questmaster says,
7311460	7315300	also worried about the writing quality and Dread Wolf now, if it is locked down,
7315500	7317460	they might have let them go for new projects.
7317460	7319660	But who knows what that means going forward?
7319660	7321980	Who will be writing for any future titles after D.A.
7321980	7325100	for or a new Mass Effect or like DLC?
7325700	7329700	You know, unless that's all locked and loaded, too. I don't know. So.
7331620	7334140	Anyway, it's it's very sad to hear about.
7334140	7338420	And now that I understand it's writers, that's that's a huge concern.
7338420	7342420	I was walking into this thinking, well, we didn't really know who it was yet.
7342420	7344540	Maybe the multiplayer or maybe, you know, again,
7345860	7349380	now I'm really worried that I'm hearing that. That's.
7350460	7353980	And it's weird to think that Baldur's Gate was a Bioware game.
7353980	7356740	Remember that Baldur's Gate was a Bioware game.
7357260	7360580	I don't know.
7362020	7364500	I don't know the new.
7364500	7366300	Hey, you know, I'm still rooting for him.
7366300	7367940	I want the new Dragon Age to be good.
7367940	7370900	I want the new Mass Effect to be good. But if they're not.
7374140	7375900	Moving on to the next story.
7375900	7379140	Exactly. We just have to.
7380140	7383420	Hey, Loki, I don't know if you're thinking about the next game
7383420	7385420	you'll work on after Pixel Poops, too.
7385420	7388300	I mean, I think you're too busy making videos to think about a new game.
7388300	7392140	But if if you ever were to make a new game, something to think about
7392500	7394820	is a new deal from the Epic Game Store.
7395060	7398100	100 percent of net revenue
7398420	7402700	if you give them six months exclusive to your game.
7403020	7406340	It's a new program that the Epic Store is running called the Epic
7406340	7408100	First Run program.
7408100	7410300	It is for games and apps.
7410300	7413420	And if you make them exclusive to Epic, you'll get, like I said,
7413420	7417180	100 percent of net revenue after that window ends.
7417180	7420580	You're going down to 88 percent of revenue because you might remember
7420820	7423740	Epic kind of tried to mix that up a little while ago
7423980	7426260	where the standard is usually about 30 percent.
7426460	7428540	And Epic took that down to 12 percent.
7428540	7431460	So now they're trying to entice you with 100 percent.
7433340	7437740	The net revenue means you don't get things like taxes, refunds.
7437780	7440260	Epic does cover payment processing and all that stuff, though.
7440260	7444740	They're saying that if you participate in this program,
7444740	7447060	you can get your stuff in front of more eyes.
7447260	7450820	The games and app get exclusive badging and spots on the home page.
7451500	7454340	So, yeah, this is going to be open to developers and publishers
7454340	7458340	who are releasing products on or after October 16th.
7458340	7461700	It is eligible if it has not appeared on another PC store
7461860	7465260	or subscription service on those storefronts.
7466740	7469660	If you already have an exclusive deal with Epic, you're not eligible for this.
7469660	7471020	So this is a new program.
7471020	7474020	Otherwise, it's interesting.
7474020	7477460	But can I can I say something very real and honest about the epic store?
7478060	7481380	I think they need to work on making that store interesting
7481380	7484180	because it's it's not a very interesting storefront.
7484180	7487580	It's a very boring storefront, quite honestly.
7488380	7492100	And the only reason I usually sign into Epic Games is either one,
7492340	7495260	they got an exclusive dammit or two.
7495460	7497300	They're giving away free games.
7497300	7499460	And I want to go claim those free games.
7499460	7502140	That's it. And even now, the free games are starting to repeat again.
7502180	7503020	Yeah. Oh, yeah.
7503020	7503860	I've already got more off.
7503860	7505260	There's rumors are going away, too.
7505260	7510460	So I but I just think the store itself is kind of ugly, to be quite honest.
7510460	7513660	And I think the product that Epic's putting out there is not
7514020	7515780	quite as robust as steam.
7515780	7518100	I mean. Don't get me wrong.
7518100	7520580	I think steam is kind of rested on it for a little while.
7520740	7523380	But I've noticed like just in the past year, year and a half,
7523380	7526420	especially with the more recent redesign, they tried to.
7526620	7529060	I kind of figured that was all tied to the steam deck.
7529260	7532100	But whatever the reason, I feel like steam at least looks a little.
7533020	7537460	Neater these days, but I just I find the epic store so fucking boring to be.
7537500	7539700	Yeah. I mean, if they get rid of the free games,
7540500	7543060	I mean, no one's going to log into that thing unless they're getting
7543260	7544340	an exclusive game.
7544340	7547180	And even then, you're just they're paying for that exclusivity.
7547180	7551540	It's like people default to steam because it's just the place
7551540	7553780	that where everything is, like I have a huge library there.
7553780	7558300	And honestly, I have a pretty decent library in epic, but I buy most of that.
7559660	7563740	Yeah. And yeah, I'm fine with not logging into it.
7565620	7568900	Loki, if you were to ever release a new game with this temp to.
7569860	7571420	A 100 percent deal.
7571420	7573500	Whatever. I mean, it's not going to hurt anything, I don't think.
7575180	7576980	I don't I wouldn't sell much anyways.
7576980	7579820	I know. I was going to say, are you saying 100 percent of zero is still zero?
7580300	7583020	Yes, I mean, kind of, you know.
7583020	7586260	By the way, go buy Pixel Poops two on steam.
7586300	7587460	It is available.
7587460	7589380	And the original Pixel Poops is free.
7589380	7592940	But you can check out some of the rad DLC via the ever hard working.
7592940	7597860	Why? Why are we always always like to plug our hard working friend, Aaron?
7598260	7600380	So. All right.
7600380	7603100	But that was the now dark to see us as to be fair.
7603100	7604340	I bought Pixel Poops, too.
7604340	7605780	I think it was on itch.io.
7605780	7609340	And actually, technically, I think Loki gets a slightly bigger cut
7609340	7612500	when you do that. So that's it doesn't matter at this point.
7612500	7615380	Like I'm almost like willing to tell Aaron just like.
7616860	7619100	Just keep the money and it like doesn't really matter.
7619100	7621980	Like we sell so few copies of it ever.
7621980	7624180	Like it just doesn't even matter anymore.
7624460	7625780	Going to make it free at some point.
7625780	7627820	I don't know when, but like not yet.
7628220	7630340	I want to get the physical version out at some point.
7630340	7631460	I think that would be really cool.
7631460	7634340	But that's a lot of work for like not a lot of return.
7634380	7635700	I have so rare.
7635700	7637100	I have something very rare.
7637100	7639100	I know. I know you have one of them.
7639100	7641220	Like one of the twelve that have been out there.
7641340	7643420	I never did get Jamie's is still sitting here.
7643420	7647980	So it gave one to one YouTuber guy,
7648940	7649900	but I gave one to him.
7649900	7651580	He never played it.
7651580	7653940	At least I didn't see a video on it.
7653940	7655940	So it's cool.
7655940	7657700	But you got there.
7657780	7658820	I did get a magazine.
7658820	7661540	Still have a whole bunch of them in, you know, sealed.
7661540	7664460	That's still I've got like five, six copies of that magazine.
7664460	7666380	Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
7666380	7668460	All right. Well, this is the part of the show
7668460	7670260	where we're going to open it up for any questions.
7670260	7671940	Also in a museum.
7671940	7675900	Member in the game museum or whatever, that's wild.
7677300	7679660	I'm going to open it up to your calls
7679660	7682140	if you want to give us a call over at Vogue Network dot com.
7682140	7684220	That's VOG Network dot com slash discord.
7684460	7687620	You can join our green room and we'll take a call or two from there
7687620	7689740	if anybody is so inclined.
7689740	7692700	Also, I would invite you to join our discord to chat with us throughout the week.
7693140	7694980	Oftentimes we chat with our listeners
7694980	7697900	throughout the week about certain news that's happening.
7697900	7701260	In fact, many listeners brought to my attention this week
7701260	7703380	that Bob Barker passed away this week.
7704620	7707420	As you many of you know, at this point at the age of ninety nine,
7708100	7711660	which is is sad, but it's also one of those things where it's like
7712140	7713460	you live to be ninety nine.
7713460	7714500	That's a really good life.
7714500	7716900	And where you get to that point where it's like, OK, this is
7716900	7719180	this is we're celebrating and let's look back on that.
7719460	7722740	So, you know, we talk about things that aren't just video games as well.
7722740	7727220	So check that out over on our discord server over at Vogue Network
7727220	7729380	dot com slash discord.
7729380	7731060	I'll also open it up to any.
7733140	7737820	Comments and questions in chat that you have for us over at Vogue Network on Twitch.
7738500	7742900	And then also I would read emails participate at Orange Laundry dot com.
7743100	7747300	But I just looked in the inbox and unfortunately is empty.
7748260	7749500	That's sad.
7749500	7753300	Participate at Orange Laundry dot com if you want to change it up for a future week.
7753500	7755380	We are also available on socials.
7755380	7758020	We are on Twitter because I'm not calling it the other thing
7758620	7761900	at not just VOG Network, but we're on Twitter at OLR.
7762060	7766780	If you want to follow Vogue Network on Blue Sky, you can at Vogue Network dot com.
7766780	7769540	And because you can actually have a domain name there on Blue Sky.
7769740	7770420	So check that out.
7770420	7773620	We are also expanding our presence on other socials as well,
7774340	7776660	including TikTok I mentioned earlier.
7776660	7782700	We're also YouTube is a big push for us lately over at a YouTube Vogue Network.
7782700	7784340	So just look up VOG Network.
7784340	7786460	You're probably going to find us in all the socials.
7786460	7790020	Yeah, in chat, as we mentioned, I saw this plenty of times as well.
7790020	7794660	Tiger Claw mentions that Arlene Sorkin, the original voice of Harley Quinn,
7794660	7798900	also passed away, who I believed also played an inspirational character
7798900	7803500	for Harley Quinn, the animated version, anyway, in Days of Our Lives,
7803500	7805300	where she kind of was originally started.
7805300	7809740	So I know the animated world really, you know, especially
7811380	7813580	with some of the other recent losses in the voice acting world.
7813580	7815660	It's very, very unfortunate.
7817340	7820700	SSG100Matt says, Rob, so what are you most looking forward
7820700	7823140	to doing at Dragon Con aside from your panels?
7823420	7826900	Well, we answered that in a video, which is available on our YouTube
7826900	7829660	over at Vogue Network, but I'll give it a serious answer.
7831460	7835620	I'm looking forward to this going to be Alan's first Dragon Con,
7835860	7838340	so I'm hoping it's going to be a little bit like Disneyland,
7838340	7840140	where you still have some of the magic
7840140	7842580	seeing it through somebody's eyes for the first time.
7842580	7845540	I think that'll be a lot of fun and you need to take him around to do things.
7846380	7849780	I like getting to see people is always good
7849780	7851900	and one of the most important parts.
7851900	7854780	And for those that have watched the TikTok
7854780	7857340	that we did in the quick two minutes we had on there,
7857900	7860700	you'll notice that's something we mentioned.
7861500	7863900	Shane in chat says, Rob is most looking forward
7863900	7866220	to the days of constant COVID testing afterward.
7866700	7868180	I know it's a risk I'm taking.
7868180	7871980	Now, I do plan to wear a mask at Dragon Con
7871980	7874740	when like not in my hotel room or speaking on a panel.
7875140	7877700	To try to lessen the chances of that.
7878500	7880540	But I know it's a risk I'm taking.
7881100	7884740	But there comes a point where you weigh the risk of that
7885060	7889260	and the risk of not taking these opportunities
7889260	7893900	that are literally once in a lifetime in some places and like getting on them.
7893900	7894980	So I'm doing everything I need to do.
7894980	7898260	I'm not going to be seeing anybody after I get back.
7899380	7900940	And yeah, I'll test. It's fine.
7901300	7905540	So I'm measuring everything with it.
7906180	7906940	That's all.
7908460	7909660	Phil of nine in chat says,
7909660	7912300	just don't let anyone with hot breath get in your face.
7912300	7913900	I don't plan to.
7913900	7919580	So in Dragon Con 2021, the year I wore a mask, I was fine.
7920300	7923580	It was last year I didn't wear a mask because nobody did.
7923580	7926740	And I also had had COVID three months earlier.
7926740	7928700	And I was like, oh, I can't get it again that quick.
7928700	7930460	And I was wrong.
7930460	7933100	So change it up a little bit this year.
7934220	7940900	So pod culture in chat says got to meet Alan at some point.
7940900	7942100	Well, he's going to be there.
7942100	7944220	So you know where to find me.
7944220	7946020	I'm sure we'll run into you at some point.
7946020	7951060	But also the well, I can't guarantee Alan will be at all my panels.
7951300	7952620	But you know what is funny?
7952620	7955220	So Alan downloaded the app.
7955220	7958780	I would say this is the panel to try to attend, if any of them.
7959380	7964740	And because Alan actually brought up the app and he was like, yeah,
7964740	7966220	I was kind of looking at the programming.
7966220	7969460	He was like, I actually was going through the panels and I was like,
7969460	7971180	oh, this one sounds interesting.
7971420	7975420	And when I marked it, I realized it was the panel you and Bobby are doing.
7976420	7980620	And it was it was the it's a panel called How Do You Do Fellow Kids
7980620	7983300	Thriving on Streaming Media After the Age of 40.
7983540	7985780	And so Alan saw that and was like, oh, that speaks to me.
7985780	7987460	And he actually bookmarked it.
7987460	7991700	But that that's funny to me, because that actually makes me go, oh,
7992220	7994580	maybe it's working for other people too.
7994580	7997700	Then if Alan like didn't remember that that was the thing we had proposed
7997700	8002020	and he actually found it on his own and wanted to do it, maybe.
8003700	8007900	Rama in chat says, Rob, is there a possibility of a surprise stream
8007900	8011620	of y'all in the hotel room with a bottle of fireball on Discord?
8011860	8015860	So when you involve alcohol, things get a little dicey
8015860	8018580	with some of the terms of service.
8018780	8021660	Like, I know you can do it on Twitch as long as that isn't
8021660	8023500	the focal point of your stream.
8023500	8027820	I'm not 100 percent sure what the rules are on TikTok, but either way,
8028700	8031100	we're not planning on any streams.
8031100	8034820	And I don't think you should, you know, put a lot of stock in that.
8034820	8038380	But might we do some more short videos
8038700	8041300	and things now that we're kind of dipping the toes into that?
8041620	8043380	I think that's something we'll be doing.
8043380	8047380	So keep an eye out on the socials for all of that, for sure.
8048780	8051500	And we'll absolutely do a wrap up show when we're back
8051500	8055900	and talk about some of that as we continue to expand our YouTube presence, for sure.
8056420	8060300	So Shane in chat says, stupid Pokemon Go.
8060300	8062420	Twitter is teasing my gay peacock.
8062740	8065100	That's Quaxley's final evolution.
8065100	8066380	I forget the name.
8066380	8067540	They know how to get me.
8067540	8069900	So I did Pokemon Go this weekend.
8069900	8072260	I actually I got 15,000 steps yesterday.
8072780	8074780	But here's I didn't pay I didn't pay for the event.
8076380	8079940	I don't want to get too into it because I just didn't want to make a scene
8079940	8083180	of it in this week's show, but like I'm really, really mad
8083180	8085420	at something that happened in Ingress, like really mad.
8085740	8089740	So I'm canceling my sub and I don't really plan to play Ingress
8089740	8092180	outside of some things that I've committed to for my team.
8093900	8097580	Pretty much past those things that are a couple of months out, that's it.
8098140	8099780	I'm pretty much done with Ingress at this point,
8099780	8102380	unless there are some serious things that change.
8102540	8106140	And so it's actually kind of made me not want to play anything Niantic,
8106140	8109060	but I'm kind of having to weigh that whole.
8110060	8114900	Recognizing my issues and recognizing
8116060	8120580	maybe I still need some gamification for my own health.
8121220	8124500	And so I allowed myself to the compromise, quote unquote,
8124500	8127580	I made is that I'll play play Pokemon and Pikmin,
8127580	8129420	but I'm not giving them any more money.
8129420	8132980	So I didn't buy the ticket.
8133180	8138180	And to be honest, you know, it wasn't anything.
8139540	8144220	Like it wasn't anything special that they were offering.
8144460	8147980	It was a fifteen dollar ticket for some more shinies.
8148540	8150940	Bobby, can I read that on air?
8150940	8154740	It was a fifteen dollar ticket for some shinies and like
8155900	8159180	some unknowns of which there's only one I was missing.
8159180	8163540	The M and one of my friends caught the M for me.
8163740	8168060	OK, so I was going to let Bobby say why he was gone tonight,
8168060	8171420	because it's his business, but he just appeared again in chat
8171420	8175460	and gave us permission to tell you all that he was in the E.R.
8175460	8178900	and his show was canceled by a three millimeter kidney stone,
8179180	8180660	which should pass tomorrow.
8180660	8184900	So and I'm sure Loki can tell you kidney stones fucking suck.
8184900	8186900	So sorry to hear that they do.
8186900	8188340	Sorry to hear that that happened to you, Bobby.
8188340	8191260	But on the other hand, with that kind of pain,
8191500	8195660	I'm actually really happy to hear when you say should pass tomorrow.
8195900	8198740	I'm like super happy to hear it's like super treatable.
8198940	8201220	And we're not talking about like a surgery or something,
8201220	8204140	because there was a part of me and I'm sure you were thinking it, too,
8204140	8208500	that was like, oh, no, is his Dragon Con going to get like,
8208500	8210580	because I know this is a big deal for Bobby, too.
8210820	8211380	It's like that.
8211380	8214460	This is like the one week a year you get to be immature as fuck,
8214460	8216460	but also mature when doing panels.
8216460	8219140	But then, you know, doing the, you know, drinking a board game place.
8219140	8220300	I was a little worried for those.
8220300	8223940	Oh, that's so I was hoping I was actually hoping like, OK,
8224140	8229660	kidney stone sound waves passing it done by Wednesday, Thursday.
8229660	8230220	And we're good.
8230220	8231780	So it sounds like that is the case.
8231780	8233580	I'm very happy to hear it,
8233580	8235660	although I'm not happy to hear it happened.
8235660	8239820	I'm just happy to hear it's got a resolution that'll be quick. So.
8240820	8245100	Ah, as Joe and Matt says, I got three shinies the whole weekend.
8245140	8246420	Didn't pay either.
8246420	8248900	My expectations were low, but the rates of this event were trash.
8249100	8252300	Shane was telling me that you only had the boosted rates if you paid.
8252860	8254340	I got two shinies.
8254340	8256660	I got one of the little Pikachu's with a crown.
8256660	8258860	I don't remember which color. I think yellow, maybe red.
8259140	8261140	I got one of the Pikachu's with a crown that shiny
8261140	8263780	and I got a lowland Diglett randomly.
8264740	8266940	That's it. I only got the two because I didn't play today.
8266940	8269260	Really, it was it was a little too hot by the time I woke up.
8269380	8272180	So that's all.
8272180	8274100	All right. Well, that's it.
8274140	8276500	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
8276700	8277900	Before we wrap it up here,
8277900	8280820	I will go around and get my final thoughts and do good night.
8281140	8285140	But let me thank you all for taking the time out to listen to Orange Launch Radio.
8285340	8286740	Thank you for listening live.
8286740	8291180	If you were here at the Voice Geeks Network or if you were listening
8291180	8294700	on our podcast feed, whether it be on Spotify, iTunes, wherever
8294700	8295820	did you find podcasts?
8295820	8298740	Thank you so much for downloading the show and check checking it out.
8298900	8300180	Tell a friend or two about the show.
8300180	8302780	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8302900	8305660	But we need more voices to put out here on air.
8305820	8309140	Don't forget to follow follow Vogue Network on all of your favorite socials,
8309140	8311860	including TikTok and YouTube, as well as here on Twitch.
8312100	8313820	We really appreciate that as well.
8313820	8317940	And yeah, as a reminder, we'll be back in two weeks.
8317940	8321420	I really, really look forward to hoping to see some of you at Dragon Con.
8321620	8324900	And again, as I was mentioning a moment ago, probably the best panel
8324900	8328540	to catch would be the streaming over 40 panel.
8328980	8330900	It's going to be a small room.
8330900	8333260	Bobby, myself and Alan will all be there.
8333260	8337420	So if you're wanting to meet folks that that would be I mean, I'm in the app
8337420	8339260	and you can see other panels I'm doing as well.
8339260	8342380	And plus, actually, I have extra ones that are on socials.
8342540	8344940	But I, I would say this.
8345260	8349620	The roast panel that I'm doing is not going to be good
8349620	8352420	if you don't know the people as well.
8352740	8354620	Like that sounds bad.
8354620	8357340	It's going to be funny, but it's I feel like a lot of jokes might
8358180	8361180	like it's it's definitely for like the digital media people
8361340	8362860	and people that actively participate in that.
8362860	8366980	So I'm just saying, like, if you want to meet me, that's not the panel to do it.
8368180	8371460	You could still I don't I'll still say hi, but I would urge you
8371460	8372620	to pick one of the other panels.
8372620	8376060	And probably the streaming over 40 is probably your best bet, to be honest.
8376460	8378500	So and thank you, Questbuster. I appreciate it.
8378500	8380060	I will have fun at Dragon Con.
8380060	8383020	Loki, I hope you have fun next weekend, too, with the video production,
8383020	8385380	all the other stuff that you're up to reviving your Twitch presence
8385380	8386740	or whatever you do.
8386740	8389140	Do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?
8390580	8393740	Yeah, just look out for my my new episode.
8393740	8395060	Hopefully it'll be coming next week.
8395060	8397460	It's a lot. Like I said, it's it's going to be longer.
8397460	8400900	It's it's movie esque is very cinematic.
8400900	8403180	So looking forward to having that done.
8403460	8404260	Look forward to seeing it.
8404260	8406820	And congrats. Congrats once again on your journey this week.
8406820	8411740	And even if it isn't a ton of exposure, you still got some exposure
8411740	8413780	and some exposure is better than nothing.
8413780	8415780	Hey, we just got a follow earlier from somebody
8415780	8417140	I think that was in your.
8417140	8419380	So that was my teammate Binnish.
8419380	8422500	Hey, I'm happy, which I want to say Binnish character team.
8422500	8426420	OK, Binnish had the highest ranking out of all of all four of us.
8427420	8429380	They are a huge fan of MCC.
8429380	8431060	They watch it with their dad, which is great.
8431060	8436180	And they're one of our new members of of our Channel 64 family this season.
8436180	8440100	So they they were the ones I mean, honestly owe a lot to them
8440100	8442300	because they were the ones that put the video together.
8442300	8444300	The application video that got in.
8445020	8446380	They're the ones that motivated us.
8446380	8449100	That was a great that was a great promo, by the way.
8449100	8450500	So props to exactly that.
8450500	8453580	We got to love those obscure, you know, Atari Jaguar commercials.
8454100	8457540	So, yeah, lots of thanks to them, for sure.
8457860	8459300	OK, awesome.
8459580	8462780	Well, I'm going to keep my final thought tonight very simple.
8462780	8465660	I am going to take my cues from the late great Bob Barker and say,
8465940	8467940	please don't forget to have your pets spayed or neutered.
8468340	8471260	Have a wonderful night, everybody. Bye.
