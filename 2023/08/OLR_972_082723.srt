1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Finally, Sony has come back to the mobile space.

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,680
Wi-Fi only, as long as you have a PS5 already, a $200 accessory for a $400 or $500 console.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,840
Hope your home internet is good and the Wi-Fi out wherever you are as well.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Not promising.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,200
I made it back in time not to record in the closet again.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,320
Now it's time for your hosts, Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,280
this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,760
every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,960
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,160
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:54,240
It is Orange Lounge Radio back and live once again tonight, August the 27th of 2023 with

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,840
episode number 972 of our show.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,120
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here with you every week joined by my co-hosts.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,680
First off over there, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Hello.

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Hello.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
Hello.

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
How are you doing?

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm all right.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,660
It's been a very trying week and I have to go right back to it tomorrow.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,520
Would you say based on your background that the last Metroid is in captivity and the galaxy

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,520
is at peace?

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,400
No, the galaxy is very much at war in my head.

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry to hear that, but I hope we can have a fun show tonight to help with some

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,640
of the sads or frustrations.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,160
I didn't say anything was sad, it's just long.

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,760
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,320
Hey, Loki.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Hello.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
And you've had quite the interesting weekend, haven't you?

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,200
Yeah, it's been busy.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Yeah.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Busy week.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Hectic week.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,560
You had a lot of prep stuff that was going into this week, didn't it?

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Didn't you?

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
There's been a lot.

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
Yeah.

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Yeah.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,760
So you participated in this very large competition in the Minecraft community that we've been

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,000
hyping for a couple of weeks here, right?

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,880
MC Championship Rising 2.

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,620
So it was fun.

47
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,800
We did it yesterday for like three hours or so and it went by in a flash.

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,500
Those three hours just gone.

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,600
That's usually how it goes.

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,000
I guess the most similar thing I can think of is doing like a live performance like Rocky

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,540
Horror Shadowcasting or Clue Shadowcasting.

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,880
You put all this work into it and then in two hours, it's done.

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
It's done with.

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,720
But how did things go for you and the team?

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
It went okay.

56
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,520
That is what I thought it was going to be.

57
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,200
So like, I mean, you have to understand, like, this is a type of a competition that a lot

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,280
of it is based off of, like, you know, PvP, parkour, that type of stuff.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,040
There's certainly a lot of creators that that's the kind of their centric type of content

60
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:01,760
that they make that, you know, it's not so much SMP content and all that, which that's

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,040
not to say that I don't I think actually the team at one is a little bit more SMP contents

62
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,000
centric, if I remember correctly.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,680
I don't remember exactly.

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,480
But but yeah, I mean, like, I didn't think I was going to come in there all of a sudden

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,560
like, yes, in a week, I'm going to become an expert at PvP and parkour like that.

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,680
I just knew that that was not going to happen.

67
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,000
So we did okay.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,280
We didn't come in last.

69
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
So that was good.

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,800
We got ninth ninth place out of ten teams, which is fine.

71
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
And we I got thirty fifth overall.

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,580
So it was all right.

73
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,800
There's a few opportunities that were kind of frustrating that like I had some pretty

74
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,120
good runs, especially an ace race.

75
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,180
The last lap, I got stuck on something in the last five positions on that.

76
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,440
And like actually the and for those watching live, you can see it playing in the background.

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,960
This is actually from the live stream that we did yesterday.

78
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,680
And so there was, you know, some opportunities that, you know, I wish I had done better,

79
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,560
but like, I don't know, it was still fun overall.

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Wish we could have played some games that we didn't.

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,600
But you know, just the nature of the game.

82
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,720
Oh, so like you only get so oh, I thought it was like an Olympics thing and you played

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
them all.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,720
You only do you.

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,120
Well, you get there's 14.

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,080
So this the twist this time was so normally in MCC, they announced nine games and they

87
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,640
play eight of them and one gets skipped in this one.

88
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,800
They announced that all 14 games were going to be available and we'd only play eight of

89
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
them.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,920
So they kept introducing a new game every round once a game was picked.

91
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,120
And so we didn't get to play everything.

92
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,000
I wanted to play bingo but fast, but we didn't get to do that.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,540
Instead, we played battle box, which I wish we had skipped that because that's something

94
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,460
that's on MCC Island.

95
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,540
You can play that literally any time for free.

96
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,840
So it's kind of lame that we played it, but whatever.

97
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
It's fine.

98
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,060
GP centric teams wanted to play that same with survival games.

99
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,120
There was a funny thing with red.

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,760
So like in the way the games are picked.

101
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,600
So there's a thing called the decision dome.

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,320
And it's this giant dome that basically it looks like a pie.

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,640
And there's a bunch of different slices for each game.

104
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,280
And you have an egg and you throw your chicken into where you want to go.

105
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,620
And well, it's a Minecraft chicken.

106
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,440
It doesn't necessarily want to listen to what you want it to do.

107
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,440
So you can throw the egg and it may just walk somewhere else.

108
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,720
But then there's also modifiers that you can get as well.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,520
So you can you can dunk other teams so that they can't throw their eggs.

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,880
You can get a thing where you can fire an arrow and it will put you down there as a

111
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,100
player and you get to knock the chickens around.

112
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,160
And so the red team got that and they did that and they weren't paying attention to

113
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,680
where they were knocking the chickens because they were trying to get them to go into bingo

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
but fast.

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,520
But then they accidentally put them all into survival games.

116
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,480
It was a moment like it was funny, though, because because I was like joking about it,

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,880
I'm like, oh, you're dead to me.

118
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,040
And you could hear it right when they did that, like, I think I made a mistake.

119
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,280
So that was kind of a funny, funny bit.

120
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,520
OK, so it sounds like in light of the fact that like, OK, you don't have as much PvP

121
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,520
experience.

122
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Oh, sure.

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,320
You were never going to get first place in this thing.

124
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,680
And so you ended up with, you know, ninth or whatever, 35th.

125
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,720
Like it really does sound like you had a lot of fun doing it and you have some great fun.

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,240
It was got some really good networking and it sounds like to so yeah, yeah.

127
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,520
So like the discord that we were all in, you know, it's going to stick around.

128
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
We like already like talking about like, oh, hey, we need to do other things together and

129
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
stuff like that.

130
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah, that'd be fun.

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
So important.

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Yeah.

133
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
So hopefully we get to do that.

134
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,240
That would be great.

135
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,720
So everyone's been really positive.

136
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I mean, sure.

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
You want to do better, obviously.

138
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
And there's like parts.

139
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,440
It's like, say, oh, man, like, I really wish, you know, I'd done better here or I didn't

140
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
do that.

141
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Yeah.

142
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Yeah.

143
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,640
So you're just I'm just going to do that to myself because that's just what happens.

144
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,000
And really, it's not so much that like I cared about like winning or anything.

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,380
It's more of the attention to the channel.

146
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,040
So like, I get it like beforehand already.

147
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,420
People don't know who I am.

148
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,740
And so they're like, oh, this person's an MCZ.

149
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,920
Oh, that's cool.

150
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,580
But then once the game's over, it's like, they don't really care about the teams that

151
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,720
came in like, you know, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, you know, they don't care about them.

152
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,440
They're only concerned about the people who want good sports.

153
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,500
It's basically sports for, you know, Minecraft reality TV show.

154
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Yeah.

155
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,040
So people that like, you know, that are like, oh, they train to like, guess who's going

156
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,220
to win and and like care, really care about the stats and stuff like that.

157
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,620
They're only going to be concerned about those top teams.

158
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,620
And so then once again, it's just like, you know, here I'm in this space again, even though

159
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,660
this is like a really prestigious thing, nobody is going to see my stuff like it's just back

160
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,180
into the same thing against the struggle that you're in.

161
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,300
But I mean, like, it's fine.

162
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
It is what it is.

163
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,780
We got like, I still got like 70 new subscribers.

164
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,260
So I mean, that's something and then it's not nothing.

165
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,140
It's yeah, the networking, it's, it's still going to be great for you.

166
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,740
It's you know, you know, just because you didn't win American Idol doesn't mean you

167
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,900
can't, you know, in the future be, you know, a Jennifer Hudson, it just takes a lot of

168
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,900
work.

169
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Exactly.

170
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,500
But yeah, I'm just I'm laughing in my head now.

171
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,740
I said reality show because I'm like, you were on like a gaming reality show this weekend.

172
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
Really you were on the tinder.

173
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,780
Yeah, you're on the tester and you didn't win.

174
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm sorry to say.

175
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,940
I mean, it's fine.

176
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,300
I knew we we knew we weren't gonna win and the team that won was really awesome.

177
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,620
Like they were all really awesome.

178
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,860
But like the in particular, the one that won, I think is very deserving because they were

179
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,560
like kind of underdogs as well.

180
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,720
And they really put in the work to like get better winning.

181
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,620
Is it just like all that famous fortune like you were talking about before in Minecraft

182
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,620
coins fortune?

183
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,700
Well, they get they get a commemorative coin shipped to them.

184
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,980
So they get that.

185
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,620
And I think the opportunity to be in the Canon events as well.

186
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,540
I'm not sure if it's like a given in it's not even necessarily everybody that wins,

187
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,660
but like some people that participate in it, you have an opportunity to maybe be invited

188
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,020
back or like maybe you get your name in there because I know like Jojo was one that she

189
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,220
was in the first MCC and their team won.

190
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,900
And she's now a Canon player as well.

191
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,540
In fact, she was one of the trainers that was in rising two.

192
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,200
So if there's some people that will go through that process, I mean, they're certainly they're

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,940
not always inviting necessarily new people all the time.

194
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,900
And it wasn't necessarily all small creators like Yogscast was in there, which they're

195
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,620
like super old in the Minecraft community.

196
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,740
They've been around forever.

197
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,600
So and that's like a group of like 30 some people I don't remember, but like four of

198
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
them were there.

199
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,160
Speaking of old, were you the oldest one in the competition?

200
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,140
I was not and the reason for that is because OK, so here's here's what happened.

201
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,440
So there was some drama during the week.

202
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,200
So originally I was going to be the oldest person playing, but the Aqua Aqua team, I

203
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,560
think it was Aqua team.

204
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,640
They had a player that I don't want to go into details, but basically she had some IRL

205
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:46,300
stuff that was not kosher that she was doing, interacting with fans and whatnot.

206
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,960
And so they dropped the team, found out about it, her teammates found out about it and brought

207
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,480
it to knock screw the folks running and said, listen, we don't feel right participating

208
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,560
because of this, you know, ridiculous.

209
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,660
So so they they said we would like to be subbed out or, you know, we it's not we don't want

210
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,080
to give this person a platform.

211
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,500
So they decided to drop out, which is very admirable.

212
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Just inappropriate conversations with underage.

213
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,620
Oh, well, then, yeah, then that's like showing her boobs or something.

214
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,880
No, no, no, no, no.

215
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
It's nothing like that.

216
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,060
It was no, it's more of she's young, but like, I don't want to go into it, but I don't even

217
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,060
know the details.

218
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,060
It doesn't matter.

219
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Stay out of the drama deep end.

220
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
Yeah.

221
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,180
No, but I wanted to know if it was something I wouldn't get.

222
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,620
No, no, no, no, absolutely.

223
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,500
So instead, so the new team got subbed in and that the guy in there, Richard, who's

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,980
a guy from Australia, I think, and he makes music and whatnot.

225
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
He's slightly older than me.

226
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
He's 43.

227
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,900
So like, he is technically now the oldest in there.

228
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,300
I was like the second oldest now.

229
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
So that's fine.

230
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
That's fine.

231
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,700
And their team did pretty good, too.

232
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,340
They're fun.

233
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,140
I got to play with them quite a bit, like practicing and whatnot.

234
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,340
So yeah, I wasn't the oldest, but no, it was fun.

235
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,020
We got to I got to train.

236
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,720
Well, we had a meeting with Cubfan135 from Hermitcraft.

237
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,580
So he was he decided I got him to coach us one day.

238
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,940
So that was exciting getting to talk to him.

239
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,660
And so now we're we're in touch now.

240
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,300
And he was even in my like, which sucks because my replay right now, my VOD doesn't have the

241
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,360
chat yet because YouTube is slow.

242
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,620
But he was in chat, too.

243
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,540
He like is wishing me good luck and stuff.

244
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,380
So I thought that was just amazing.

245
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,580
It's like died right there.

246
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,580
So yeah, cool.

247
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,500
So I've talked to two hermits now.

248
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,800
So we get to get to see them eventually, all of them.

249
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,540
And that was something that wouldn't have happened if this hadn't all, you know, happened.

250
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,000
So I'm just you know, I know you're you certainly are glad that you did the experience and everything

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
like that.

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
But there's lots to win besides the gold medal.

253
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,280
In fact, going to our chat room because I have yet to mention we do tape live every

254
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,760
Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern, six o'clock Pacific at the voice of Geeks Network,

255
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,700
twitch.tv slash VOG network right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, although Bobby Black

256
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,860
Wolf did not end up being live tonight, but he will be back in two weeks after Dragon

257
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,160
Khan and looks forward to chatting with you all then.

258
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,900
So he'll be back in two weeks.

259
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,400
And we will not be here next week as well.

260
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,640
But I will tap into that in just a little bit.

261
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,260
But in their chat room as we tape live over twitch.tv slash VOG network, as to 100 Matt

262
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,300
says, the main thing is Loki, you may not have one, but you're part of a much larger

263
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,300
community.

264
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,980
Now, you're getting more and more known, which is a huge step for when you started this journey

265
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
a bit ago.

266
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,100
I'm on tier lists now.

267
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
That's kind of funny.

268
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:00,340
Now, granted, like, yeah, I'm on a Minecraft tier list now, Minecraft content creator.

269
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,340
Loki is like this.

270
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,340
It's like this.

271
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,740
Imagine you're on this very large network of independent internet radio stations.

272
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,820
And you get nominated for an award that you're the best one of the year.

273
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,180
And then you actually travel to the ceremony in person.

274
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,620
And then they not only you not only didn't win, but they didn't even read your fucking

275
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,260
name on the envelope until one of your co hosts, the audience said, Hey, so loudly,

276
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:34,740
it was picked up on the internet broadcast and the person hosting said, Oh, yeah, and

277
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,780
these guys to imagine that and think about what a great thing it is to be part of that

278
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,300
much larger community.

279
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,340
It doesn't matter that we are these people did win.

280
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,140
It matters that we became a part of that community, which fell apart three years later.

281
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,620
I mean, yeah, it's fine.

282
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,420
Like, I think it's funny, though, because like all the like, the tier list stuff that's

283
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,020
been coming out now, it's like most of it's just like, I don't know who this person is.

284
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,340
I'm like, that's fine.

285
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,820
I'm like, I just like being on the tier.

286
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,900
I like that my name and my my thumbnail or my profile pic is on the tier list at all.

287
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,940
So they're still talking about you, whether it's good, whether I've got a wiki page out

288
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
on the internet.

289
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,340
Now, I'm on the MCC wiki page now.

290
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,180
So like that, that's the thing now, you know, that that happened.

291
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,620
Does it does it link to the OLR wiki so we can wiki the wiki?

292
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,620
I doesn't, but wiki, wiki whack.

293
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,180
That is wiki, wiki whack.

294
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,380
The most dad joke I've told on this show in like three years.

295
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:43,940
Oh, gosh, like I Yeah, so like, because I knew it was going to be kind of a struggle like to

296
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,660
like, we weren't gonna be doing well, I was trying to be as entertaining as possible.

297
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,820
So like, I had like prepared bits for, you know, while we played and stuff like that.

298
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,780
I know you did make me proud.

299
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:04,220
So so like, for example, during Sands of Time, I was sharing facts about sand during Sands of

300
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Time, which is fun.

301
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,780
And it's just a very extra thing to do.

302
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,260
I love it.

303
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,540
And then what else?

304
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:19,260
Oh, before Ace Race, I was incorrectly quoting Dom from Fast and the Furious, mixing in some of

305
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,580
his quotes and also fast food slogans with that, which I thought was ridiculous.

306
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,020
But I did it anyways.

307
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,660
I don't know, it was fun.

308
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,260
Well, I want to make sure we have time to get into the news tonight and all that good stuff as

309
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,460
well.

310
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,700
But you know, congrats, congrats from all of us here, not just at OLR, but the voice geeks network,

311
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,500
you know, I know it was a very visible, very high profile thing for you to do.

312
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,900
And I'm glad you not only did it, but you you you poured yourself into it.

313
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,220
And I hope those kiddos and I can say that because you were almost almost the oldest one of the

314
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,580
competition.

315
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,300
I hope those kiddos know just how much of yourself you poured into that competition and really,

316
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,060
really took it to heart and had fun with it.

317
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,620
So congrats.

318
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,500
You made us proud, Loki.

319
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,700
Thank you.

320
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,540
You're welcome.

321
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,100
All right, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight.

322
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,940
There's been a lot going on in the gaming world.

323
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,740
Of course, with Gamescom this last weekend, we've had a bit of news come out of that.

324
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,900
So we're going to get into that.

325
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,940
I will also quickly mention here I know I've been saying it for a few weeks here on the show.

326
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,100
We collectively will not be here live next week with Orange Launch Radio as I will be off at

327
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,140
Dragon Con with Bobby Blackwell also from the voice geeks network.

328
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,060
We actually did a whole little pre special if you want to hear more about Dragon Con in depth.

329
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:43,780
That is over on our YouTube archive over at VOG Network on YouTube and even our first TikTok.

330
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,180
We did a minute and a half version of our most looking forward to things for Dragon Con that is

331
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,420
available as well over TikTok at VOG Network for the very first time.

332
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,180
So very excited for Dragon Con.

333
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,660
But that means there will be no show this next weekend.

334
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:01,220
However, Dark Soccer, I know you're going to be doing your thing next Saturday, next Saturday,

335
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,820
next Sunday, well, maybe Saturday and Sunday, but next Sunday for sure, right?

336
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,460
Yeah, well, I'm back on my regular work schedule.

337
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,140
So I will be doing a at least 12 hour subathon.

338
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,420
Like, and I'm like, for if I get like a follow, I'll add like a minute.

339
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,340
And if I get a sub, I'll add like five minutes or something.

340
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,420
So we'll see how long I go.

341
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,820
Because since I'll be back on my normal schedule, I will not have to get up early on Monday.

342
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,220
So, yeah, I think it would be a fun thing to do anyway.

343
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,620
Hopefully with Labor Day weekend, that means more people can tune in, too.

344
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,060
Although I might also mean people out of town, but hopefully it all works out.

345
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,140
So. All right.

346
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,620
Loki, Loki, are you doing anything online next weekend?

347
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,220
Are you taking you get to have a nice, quiet night with Mrs.

348
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,620
Loki? I may I may try to stream.

349
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,660
I don't know. It depends on where I'm at with editing, because I'm still editing my finale,

350
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,980
which is taking me three weeks so far.

351
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,300
So I made it a point that I don't want to play back on because I did.

352
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,420
I mean, without getting into my game week, I did play in our season three server,

353
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,260
but I don't want to get too far into it because I don't want to have like two episodes

354
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,020
in process at the same time.

355
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,340
I want to finish one and then go and start the next one.

356
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,140
So I'm forcing myself to edit until it's done.

357
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,620
I'm not playing on the server.

358
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,860
So hopefully I'll be done by then.

359
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,820
And then I will be able to play and then maybe live stream from there.

360
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,300
But I do want to live stream more for sure on Twitch

361
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,180
instead of YouTube, because the viewership seems to be better there.

362
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,420
And originally my plan was because of, you know, YouTube.

363
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,140
I thought, you know, it'd be easier for subscribers and stuff.

364
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,380
That doesn't seem to be the case.

365
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,940
So discoverability seems to be better on Twitch.

366
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,020
So we're going to go back there again.

367
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,180
Give that a try because we're affiliate anyway.

368
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,460
So I mean, why not? Why not?

369
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,860
All right. Well, that's all what's going on next weekend.

370
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,180
And then OLR, we will collectively be back in two weeks from tonight.

371
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,740
And of course, on the podcast feed and all that good stuff as well.

372
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,460
That will be Sunday, September 10th that we will be back.

373
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,380
No show on September 3rd.

374
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,980
OK, let's get into so I mentioned Gamescom happened this week,

375
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,020
but there was some news earlier in the week

376
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,700
that really had a lot of people kind of taken by surprise and cut.

377
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,860
Well, I don't know about surprise,

378
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,220
but definitely, definitely a lot of people talking on social this week.

379
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,940
Loki, you want to share with us the big news that came down

380
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,780
from Nintendo this week?

381
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,060
Yeah. So Nintendo basically said that, hey, you know what?

382
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,260
I hope you like Chris Pratt do the voice of Mario.

383
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,860
That's all they said.

384
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,220
But they did say that Charles Martinet has, you know, stepped down

385
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,300
from the voice of Mario that, you know, while it's been honored

386
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,980
to work with him, you know, he is no longer going to be doing it.

387
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,820
Didn't say who else is going to be taking over for Mario, but

388
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
know that it is not Charles Martinet.

389
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,860
That probably also makes sense why the new trailer for the new Mario game

390
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,540
didn't quite sound the same.

391
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,700
So it's probably a new voice actor.

392
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,980
I'd be curious to see who is doing it.

393
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,380
I'm actually kind of glad they didn't say who it was going to be,

394
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,700
because if they said who it was going to be the same day

395
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,820
they announced this news, that person would have gotten bullied.

396
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,980
Like, yeah, it sucks.

397
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,980
But that's just true facts like that.

398
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,300
And it's not like it would happen.

399
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,940
I don't think it's that they fired him or anything like that.

400
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,420
It's probably his choice.

401
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,980
He probably just can't.

402
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,500
Maybe he can't do the voice anymore.

403
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,540
Just doesn't want to.

404
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,500
We don't know.

405
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,580
And that's what this all boils down to.

406
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,340
We don't know.

407
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,460
And we're not going to know because people look, I'll just say people

408
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,180
would be quick to bring up that a couple of years ago,

409
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,780
Charles Martinet in an interview said, I want I want to do this till I die.

410
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,260
Or I would do this until OK.

411
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,980
Well, I guess a lot can change in two years.

412
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,740
A lot can change in two years.

413
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,380
You know what I mean?

414
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,260
And we don't know.

415
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,700
Like, it's not it's not up for us to pry into his personal life

416
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,660
to try to find out.

417
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,500
Like, we just know this is what it is.

418
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,020
You can kind of infer that based on his new role

419
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,460
of being the ambassador or whatever, what did they call it?

420
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,540
The Mario Ambassador?

421
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,020
He is going to be the Mario ambassador.

422
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,540
Yeah.

423
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,420
So you can infer through that that relations are still good, right?

424
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,220
Because it wasn't.

425
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,980
Well, fuck you. I quit then type is not that I would ever think.

426
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,940
But it wasn't.

427
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,340
I mean, there are certainly people in this world that if they were told

428
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,700
you're no longer going to be able to do the voice, they would say, all right,

429
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,740
give me give me my last paycheck.

430
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,340
I'm fucking out of here type of thing, right?

431
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,380
But that's that's not what happened here.

432
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,140
So there is a little bit of a, you know, OK, you know, Mr.

433
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,180
Martinet is still working with Nintendo in these ambassadorships.

434
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,540
It also allows him to continue what is probably his bread and butter

435
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,420
of income at this point, which is making appearances at Fan Expo,

436
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,940
doing the panels to give his good old hearted wahoos and recording bumpers

437
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,340
for podcasts like what on this network and all of that.

438
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,420
Like, no shade.

439
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,020
That is literally what, you know, he does.

440
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,860
And, you know, make some money from those convention appearances

441
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,780
and autographs, the selfies and all of that.

442
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,060
And it allows him to still carry that official capacity

443
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,620
is of Mark because he's the ambassador for Mario or whatever.

444
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,020
And still allows him to do that.

445
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,700
So it's it's still a nice win situation for him.

446
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,500
Tiger Klom chat points out

447
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,740
Charles Martinet has been involved in Nintendo projects from 1996 to 2023.

448
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,580
I count 2023 because of his role in the Super Mario Brothers movie. Yes.

449
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,780
And honestly, and I think we can talk about this now.

450
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,700
Now that the Mario Brothers movie is on video, I think if you were going

451
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,100
to be worried about spoilers, we're kind of past that point.

452
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,500
So I think the fact that he did get to play their dad,

453
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,220
which, by the way, I called on this show when they first announced him as a guest.

454
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,020
I just want to point that out.

455
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,500
I was trying very hard not to spoil it by doing the nana nana nana.

456
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,100
I'm right. He also did another voice, right?

457
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,060
Wasn't he the guy playing the music in the arcade, playing the arcade machine?

458
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,300
I don't remember his name is in there.

459
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,500
So but my point is that was a very nice

460
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,180
legacy role for him, you know, like like you're Mario's dad.

461
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:12,940
It's like a literal kind of like passing of the baton of swords.

462
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,500
And I thought that was really cool.

463
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,740
And he did a great job with the roles in the movie.

464
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,340
And yeah, so he got to be in the movie.

465
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,140
The other Mario and having just done a panel

466
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,580
like a month ago with some of the other voice actors and actresses in the game.

467
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,020
Unfortunately, none of them were in the movie.

468
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,780
So it really goes to show like Charles Martinet and his tie

469
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,660
to the franchise and everything, that the fact that, you know,

470
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,580
he was able to stand in lockstep with

471
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,860
A and B list Hollywood celebrities that made up the rest of the cast.

472
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,580
Tyra Conchat says best wishes for the new Mario voice actor.

473
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,940
He has big shoes to fill. Yeah.

474
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,540
And I, I really feel sorry for this person because the moment it's announced,

475
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,500
people are going to hate him from the outset.

476
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,620
And I really wish people wouldn't do that.

477
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,540
Like this is this is just a decision that's been made.

478
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,180
Why did they make the decision though?

479
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,780
Here's my here's my honest to God thinking.

480
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,300
And people are probably going to take issue with me saying this.

481
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,740
I'm sorry, but I'm just I'm going to just say this.

482
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,700
It's like I'm telling you like it is.

483
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,180
My thought is now that the movie has kind of happened,

484
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,260
the wall to Mario doing dialogue has kind of been breached.

485
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,300
And the reason why I say kind of is that Captain Lou breached this wall

486
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,300
a long time ago and others and not just Captain Lou, but others before.

487
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,860
There's been actually many voices of Mario, you know, from.

488
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,500
There's also the anime movie.

489
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,460
Yeah, anime, the Super Saturday arcade, when Peter Cullen did and all this.

490
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,500
There's there's lots of people that have done this.

491
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,980
But for many, many years and let's be honest,

492
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,020
for most people in their 20s and young 30s,

493
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,580
they haven't heard a lot of voice acted Mario beyond the

494
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,660
wahoo wahoo in all the stuff that Charles Martinet did.

495
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,860
And I think what's happening is that I don't know

496
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,580
if it's going to happen in Super Mario Wonder, but in a future Mario game,

497
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,420
we're probably getting full Mario voice acting.

498
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,020
And they're going to look to that Mario voice acting

499
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,540
to line up a little more with what we saw of Mario in the movie.

500
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,780
A little bit of the stereotypical Italian accent,

501
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,220
but maybe not that full energy, that full 11 the Charles Martinet did,

502
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,180
because, you know, a lot of people have suggested that

503
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,580
two hours of Charles Martinet doing his high energy Mario

504
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,620
probably wouldn't have been as.

505
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,980
Wonderful to hear, as people think,

506
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,460
and that's no shade to a very hard working man

507
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,580
who I really respect a lot in this industry.

508
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,100
It's just artistically, is it the right fit?

509
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,580
And sometimes we have to admit the answer is no, maybe.

510
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,740
So I that's my thought.

511
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,820
That's my thought for how this, you know, again,

512
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,620
I don't know, I'm just some schmo with a podcast, but my thought is

513
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,860
whether it's in Wonder or it's on the successor console to the Nintendo Switch,

514
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,020
we're going to get a fully or more fully voice acted Mario game.

515
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,060
And they want somebody whose voice is a little more in line

516
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,940
with what was in the movie, not Chris Pratt, though.

517
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,380
Obviously, he's the guy from Final Fantasy 16.

518
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,220
He's too expensive.

519
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,660
Now, that was funny.

520
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,100
But it got to I can't believe how many websites

521
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,940
get their fucking clicks from the voice actor for Clive wants to be the voice

522
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,940
of Mario. It was it was a stupid fucking joke.

523
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,220
It was a stupid fucking.

524
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,420
And I say that in the nicest possible way as somebody who really loves Ben Starr.

525
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,780
I mean, really, I really, really have a crush on that guy.

526
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:43,100
He's so hot.

527
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,300
I can't listen. Listen, I'm 100 percent straight, but he he's pretty hot.

528
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,780
Thank you. Thank you.

529
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,060
Like, it's a OK to be a little gay for Ben Starr.

530
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,380
Like he or totally gay for it.

531
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,420
He's totally, totally worthy of that.

532
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,340
So my point is, it's really mind blowing to me how many people are like,

533
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,700
oh, he's really going for the voice of Mario.

534
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,940
No, he's not. He guess what?

535
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,140
He knew it was a tweet that would get retweeted.

536
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,580
And he was fucking right.

537
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,820
And then he got other voice actors in on it, too.

538
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,820
I don't know if he said then other people started.

539
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,580
We haven't seen the other ones. No.

540
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,500
Oh, Bobby retweeted one for one of the folks in Yakuza

541
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,860
that that was doing it's it's the same joke, but it's funny.

542
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,060
It's funny to see multiple people do it and like their characters voices.

543
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,140
So anyway, no, it has not been star, unfortunately,

544
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,500
but it is going to be somebody who it's it's going to be

545
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,060
the made for TV version of Chris Pratt is the voice is going to be.

546
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Troy Baker, you think?

547
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,620
I don't know. He's the voice of everybody.

548
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,180
If I was my favorite voice, it's fine.

549
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,260
What's that? What I think what I think it is in the end is

550
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,140
that it's not any of our fucking business.

551
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,220
It doesn't matter either.

552
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,860
It's like, who cares? Like who the voice is? Yeah.

553
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,780
I'm going to go in with an open mind if other people don't go into there.

554
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,860
We'll screw them.

555
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,460
And I hope the guys, the person coming into it has tough skin.

556
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,460
But in the end, it doesn't matter because it's happened

557
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,980
and there will be a replacement deal with it. Pixel shades.

558
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,340
Just you need that for your little vtuber.

559
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,580
He needs some pixel shades.

560
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,180
I have some pixel shades.

561
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,140
I have to make a new model to put them on her, but I have some pixel shades.

562
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,260
No, but you you know what?

563
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,460
You make a great point, honestly, because if you think about it,

564
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,460
Charles Martinet was not always the voice of Mario.

565
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,420
And before him, most notably Captain Lou.

566
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,540
And a lot of us were of an age where Captain Lou was, you know,

567
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,180
let's do the barber yoga.

568
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,940
And I, by the way, in the movie, I love that they referenced that as well.

569
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,020
That was the coolest thing.

570
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,860
Actually, Captain Lou wasn't the first.

571
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,940
No, no. And I know he wasn't the first, but which I said earlier.

572
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,100
But, you know, my point is that when the voice changed

573
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,660
from Captain Lou to Charles Martinet, that was a big change.

574
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,180
But you know what?

575
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,460
People really dug Charles Martinet at the end of the day.

576
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,060
So whoever this new person is, give him a chance.

577
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,140
And it doesn't take anything away from the awesome legacy

578
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,580
that Charles Martinet has left.

579
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,700
And you know what?

580
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,300
If you love Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario,

581
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,980
go to a convention he's appearing at, pay him for a selfie and tell him so.

582
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,940
He'll appreciate that.

583
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,260
And then it's a win.

584
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,020
If you feel Charles Martinet should still

585
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,180
be getting paid, then by all means, pay him.

586
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,620
He is going to keep getting paid as the investor.

587
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,780
That's right. That's right.

588
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,380
He will still be getting paid for that role.

589
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,700
So he's basically pulling a Miyamoto.

590
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,060
What's the last game that Miyamoto actually programmed?

591
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,780
Actually programmed?

592
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,780
Oh, golly, I don't I feel like I heard he was in there

593
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,620
assisting with something in the not too distant past.

594
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,300
But yeah, not not from the ground up.

595
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,380
I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.

596
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,660
What modern programming languages does he know?

597
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,580
Yeah, I mean, seriously.

598
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,700
Yeah, I mean, back in.

599
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,620
I'm just saying, you know, back in the day, I think that like.

600
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,820
There was the big win in the 90s was,

601
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,020
you know, C++ and all that, so, yeah.

602
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,620
Well, in all these things,

603
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,660
probably assembly languages of various sorts for the old carts and all that.

604
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,580
So and now he's punch cards and they liked it.

605
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
It was Fortran.

606
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,180
No. Tiger Claw chat says they started adding a voice for Mario

607
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,380
once the N64 came out due to its processing power.

608
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,180
They were able to add some voiceovers.

609
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,580
They didn't. Did you remember what I said earlier in the show?

610
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,740
The last Metroid is in captivity.

611
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,180
That was some Super Nintendo magic there.

612
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,220
Of course, that probably took up half the cartridge right there,

613
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,620
but you could do it hypothetically.

614
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,380
Well, remember me talking about Star Ocean before?

615
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,220
Sure. How much voice acting that had

616
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,460
like a whole spoken introduction and voice acting on every battle level.

617
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,860
And they had to expand the the memory in the cartridge.

618
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,540
Well, if you want to go way, way back, go back to one of my favorite systems

619
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,380
ever that I never shut up about here on the show.

620
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:29,180
The Commodore 64 had some rad voice synth and it had games

621
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,220
like Impossible Mission the very beginning.

622
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,660
Another visitor stay a while, stay forever.

623
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,980
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato?

624
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,860
It is. What kind of chip you got in there, a Dorito?

625
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,500
OK, but the Commodore 64 had a legendary voice because Ghostbusters

626
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,860
actually had the in the very beginning when you would fire it up the Ghostbusters.

627
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,140
Like it actually there was a lot of like voice stuff again.

628
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,420
That was a computer from 1985.

629
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,100
So we've we've had voice acting of sorts.

630
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,460
For a long time. Look at Turtles in Time.

631
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,060
You had a lot of voice acting.

632
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,980
Oh, my God. I mean, it's just like listening

633
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,740
to Mickey Mouse today versus, you know, 30 years ago. Mm hmm.

634
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,620
It's a different voice.

635
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,940
But it's still Mickey Mouse.

636
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,300
Yep. You know, yep.

637
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,860
Or as Dark Tatia brings up Street Fighter two.

638
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,140
But I mean, think about the various iterations of the Street Fighter series

639
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,020
and how many different voice actors you've had over the years.

640
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,980
The view today is not the view from, you know, the late 80s.

641
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,820
Or take it a step further to mocap in the neighbor Mortal Kombat.

642
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,020
The person who mocapped Sonya back in the day is not still doing it today.

643
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,900
So, you know, of course, there were a lot of there were a lot of other things

644
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,060
at play with some changes between Mortal Kombat three and so forth.

645
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,020
But you could do a whole other show about that.

646
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,100
So anyway. All right.

647
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,220
Well, best of luck to whoever you know, it's again,

648
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,300
it's always kind of sad to see the changing of a guard.

649
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,540
But I think it is like one of those things you have to go.

650
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,100
This this happens artistically. It happens.

651
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,700
And it's great that Charles Martinet will still be touring conventions

652
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,260
and getting to do Mario in some capacity and allowing us to pay him

653
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,060
while still also collecting a paycheck of sorts from Nintendo.

654
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,420
And so I think we should all commit to not bullying the new person

655
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,500
and just seeing what the new game has to offer.

656
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,420
You know, and also the other thing, too, which is interesting.

657
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,900
So he's not doing the voice of Mario.

658
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,900
But what about all the other characters he does?

659
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,020
No mention of that. That's true.

660
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
No mention of Wario.

661
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,380
Well, Wario and Waluigi are never coming back, I'm sorry to say.

662
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,380
I'm kidding. But that's you ask a great question, though.

663
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,500
Or Luigi or like all the other stuff. Yeah.

664
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,180
Honestly, I think this is his way of saying retirement.

665
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,700
That's that's kind of your your voice is an instrument.

666
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:00,660
And on top of that, it's a a a series of muscles and nerves.

667
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,100
And as I can tell you from my own experience,

668
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,020
you know, doing stuff on phones and, you know, podcasting and streaming

669
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,300
and everything for as long as I have your instrument will give out.

670
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,900
Yeah, especially, you know, on in much older people.

671
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,740
It's going to just have even less resilience than it used to.

672
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,420
I would now I don't know how June four eight managed to do it

673
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,300
as long as she did, but she's also magical and a goddess.

674
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,740
But, you know, I think if this is retirement from voice

675
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,300
acting, then he's he's more than deserved it.

676
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,300
He's been doing this for a long time.

677
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:46,220
And I hope that he enjoys his ambassadorship and resting his voice. Yeah.

678
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,500
All right. Well, on that note, we're going to move on

679
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,300
and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games

680
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,060
we've been playing this week, Mario games or otherwise.

681
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,580
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

682
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,420
It was pretty OK.

683
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:04,020
I since my stream schedule is all thrown off from having to work

684
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,340
in an eight by five and get up at five a.m.

685
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,380
the freaking morning.

686
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,420
I did play the new Cult of the Lamb DLC.

687
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,340
It was like the Cult of the Lamb and don't starve crossover type thing.

688
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,900
They just basically had a new

689
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,380
a new cultist that you could add in.

690
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,220
We're like, if you kill one of your one of your people in your cult,

691
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,300
you're left with a skull and you bury their head in a grave.

692
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,380
And then the spider creature crawls out.

693
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,420
And he's just a normal person hanging around.

694
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,580
But he's got spiders all around him.

695
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,100
And there was like some decorative stuff that was really about it.

696
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,860
You know, it was just the game as usual after that.

697
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,900
I think it's still those cult of the lamb.

698
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,380
I love it. And every time something new comes out, I'm going to play it.

699
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,900
I'm trying to think, of course,

700
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,700
I played some Disney Dreamlight Valley, which I love that game.

701
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,500
I played some off stream just because it's such chill vibes.

702
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
You know, that's like my cozy game.

703
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,540
And then, of course, I played some Dead by Daylight,

704
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,900
still working on those killer that some might do a little bit more

705
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,180
off stream DVD.

706
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,100
I think the last adapt I got was finally

707
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,620
Pyramid Head after some struggle.

708
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,740
And then, of course, I played Live Alive last night.

709
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,980
I finished the ninja scenario, which was very complicated.

710
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,780
Like you have to go into these rooms and go back to these rooms.

711
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,980
You don't really have any clue on what you're supposed to do.

712
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,020
And if it wasn't that I had like a like a semi walk through

713
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,660
with sort of like a guide, I think I would have gotten very lost.

714
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:58,180
So as it stands, I have the the robot to do cube

715
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,740
and I have the

716
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,940
the other guy, the karate guy.

717
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,100
But it was the game is really good.

718
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:14,300
I loved the whole story and music for the lesson area that I did.

719
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,940
And I love that it's broken down into such digestible chapters is really.

720
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,860
And the last one was very, you know, steeped in,

721
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,300
you know, Japanese myth and, you know, combined with history.

722
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,180
And one of your enemies, by the way, is a giant koi who.

723
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,420
Yeah, I totally didn't fight the giant koi.

724
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,300
He was too hard, but I put a picture up.

725
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,300
But that's been it, I've been playing my word scapes

726
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,780
and they're turning it way much more into a money gouge

727
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,980
and I'm trying to tear myself away from it.

728
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,700
Oh, oh, and I did play a little bit just on my own of panorama cotton.

729
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,020
That game gives me kind of vertigo, but I also super love it.

730
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,060
You remember Rainbow Cotton, right? Yeah.

731
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,020
Panorama cotton style wise is its precursor.

732
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,340
It was on the Genesis.

733
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,660
They made the master system, I should say.

734
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,180
They made like 600 copies.

735
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,300
So, yeah, it is, however, now on the Switch eShop.

736
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,420
So definitely a Genesis game worth playing.

737
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,860
I think I've covered it before. Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

738
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,580
All right. Well, we'll go over to Loki and your gaming week.

739
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,020
I feel like we probably covered a good chunk of the top.

740
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,460
Yeah, we've talked about a lot of it. I'll defer anyway.

741
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,620
It's been a lot of just Minecraft on the MCC practice server

742
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,740
and, of course, on MCC Island as well.

743
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,820
I played a little bit of that.

744
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,980
Yeah, it was basically all a lot of practice during the week.

745
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,580
We did take a break from practice to film

746
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,340
a bingo thing just with the team members.

747
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,180
So that's out now on Binish's channel.

748
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,500
And we did that. That was fun.

749
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,700
Our team won. Spoilers.

750
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,420
But yeah, it was a lot of fun.

751
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,820
It was a lot of practice.

752
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,540
Last day, we ended up doing a hide and seek on the practice server

753
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,100
as well in the Ace Race course.

754
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,940
So that was fun because they have a lot of like places

755
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,260
you can kind of get to that you're not supposed to.

756
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,860
And so we were just messing around with that a bit.

757
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,740
And that was pretty cool.

758
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,140
Yeah. And then, of course, you know, MCC yesterday was really big.

759
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,020
A lot of the week's actually been editing still.

760
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,500
I've been doing a lot of stuff with my final episode.

761
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:36,900
It's so this whole season has been kind of themed around like

762
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,780
you didn't compromise on.

763
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,220
You did too much.

764
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,540
You won't compromise on like reducing it down to something that's manageable.

765
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,940
And that's what the finale is.

766
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,860
It's like it's like too much.

767
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,460
And I'm not compromising on something that's more manageable.

768
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,100
Instead, I'm just, you know, going to the extreme with it.

769
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,900
So it gets pretty wild as far as like editing and stuff goes with it.

770
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,220
And I'm very excited to have it done.

771
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,220
I'm like, I have to look now.

772
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,420
I'm pretty far into it, actually.

773
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:16,820
I am already like 12 minutes into the episode already as far as fully edited.

774
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,460
But the problem is the shots that I'm doing now are very complicated.

775
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,100
So requires like six different replay shots for every shot that I do.

776
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,940
Just because of different camera changes and

777
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,860
having lots of characters teleport in and out of things.

778
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,660
There's lots of teleportation and time travel and all this.

779
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,820
It gets crazy, OK?

780
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,500
It gets very crazy.

781
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,300
So it's going to be fun.

782
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,180
I am very excited to get it done.

783
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,620
This week should be a lot easier to be able to concentrate on.

784
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,020
I'm not splitting my time between practice and

785
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,180
doing this stuff.

786
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,820
I do want to get back onto the server

787
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,580
to actually play with the new people and stuff.

788
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,900
They've been great.

789
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,060
We launched last week and and it's been fun.

790
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,340
So we have lots of people on the server now.

791
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,380
Shenang is happening and I haven't been part of it, a lot of it,

792
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,020
because I haven't been on there, but I'm hoping to change that this week.

793
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,860
So, yeah, it's just kind of switching gears

794
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:19,420
from like overly complex and like big, huge things to try to make it more manageable.

795
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,540
That said, I will easily slip into old habits.

796
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,580
Pretty, it's going to happen.

797
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,740
I guess it's just a matter of when I'm going to just do it.

798
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,180
But I think with the fact that this season is going to be all based around

799
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,780
an amusement park, so building an amusement park with rides and mini,

800
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,060
it's all focused on rides and mini games.

801
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,940
And so because of that, it's a lot of design that's going to have to go into it.

802
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,060
So I don't think I can rush through it very much

803
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,540
because designing mini games takes a long time.

804
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,820
And so I'm going to try to break those projects up a bit if I can,

805
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,460
because otherwise it'll be like two months between episodes and I'll do that.

806
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,780
So we'll see. We'll figure it out.

807
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,300
But it's going to be fun. All right.

808
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,500
My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff, a lot of the same old stuff.

809
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,180
Still playing a little bit Diablo for Final Fantasy 14.

810
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,740
I needed to do the Moonfire Fair event to make sure

811
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,580
I get my little Power Rangers outfit that they were given away this year.

812
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,140
I need to make sure I do their new event before I leave for Atlanta,

813
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,580
because I don't know if I'd have time when I get back.

814
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,740
I passed in Diablo four.

815
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,500
So my eternal character, whatever the permanent realm is called,

816
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,140
was level 61 when the season started.

817
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
And now my season character is 62.

818
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,340
So I've officially passed that point

819
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,540
where my season character is now stronger than my non seasonal one.

820
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,980
And I'm almost completely through the battle pass.

821
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,340
There's 90 stages, the battle pass. I hit 84 today.

822
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,860
I'll probably clear the battle pass completely.

823
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,500
But granted, because I bought the Uber edition,

824
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,380
I had like a skip for 20 tiers or something.

825
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,020
And then Amazon Prime was given away like four additional skips.

826
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,580
So I was like, all right, whatever.

827
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,260
So I can't say I did it all myself, but I

828
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,820
considering I have until October for the season to be done,

829
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,020
I probably would play enough.

830
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,700
And then I've actually been playing a little bit of Overwatch two.

831
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,300
Funny enough, I didn't really think I'd get back into this

832
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,340
game, but I have a couple friend groups that are like, yeah, you should play.

833
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,860
You should play. So I've been playing a little bit.

834
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,500
And I find that I really enjoy playing Anna, actually.

835
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,020
And I never thought I was very good with her,

836
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,980
but she's actually a lot of fun to heal with.

837
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,820
So I've been doing that.

838
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,540
And then today I was exploring the PVE a little bit.

839
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,580
I didn't buy the thing because I'm still trying to get a sense of if that's worth it.

840
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,700
But they have like a limited time event that I already forgot the name of it,

841
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,620
underworld or something like that, that has some different modes.

842
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,860
There's like a regular mode and then there's like a don't stand

843
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,140
where the rockets are going to fall.

844
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,580
And then like basically like

845
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,820
good zones and bads and another mode that's bad zones.

846
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,180
So it's yeah, it's interesting.

847
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,660
So I like that you get a lot of credit for

848
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,740
not that I really care about the battle past Overwatch to begin

849
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,220
a lot of credit for that type of stuff, even if

850
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,940
you do the PVE stuff, which I find very interesting.

851
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,220
But yeah, also tip on that.

852
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,660
And this helped me incentivize me to play Xbox.

853
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,500
Game Pass has a thing where you can unlock all of the new heroes

854
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,740
in Overwatch to right up through the brand new healer lady.

855
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,060
I think her name's Ilari.

856
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,300
I hope I didn't get that wrong.

857
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,540
But you can unlock everybody through her.

858
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,980
All the people that have come out since Overwatch two on Game Pass.

859
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,580
But you have to launch it on Xbox first

860
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,180
and then through cross network stuff, it unlocks on your PC.

861
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,660
So that's that's what I did. And it worked.

862
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,140
So, yeah, I'll take it.

863
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,420
But yeah, that was that was honestly pretty much it.

864
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,700
My game, I think I maybe played one game of Dead by Daylight,

865
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,060
but I've been I've been kind of sleeping on that a little bit.

866
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,420
I think I'll I'll be more excited when the alien stuff comes out,

867
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,220
which is next week.

868
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,460
Well, I guess not because I'm going to be out of town.

869
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,020
So maybe in two weeks, I'll get around to doing some of the alien stuff.

870
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,740
But can't wait to play as Ripley, to be quite honest.

871
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,620
That'd be awesome. I'll play it.

872
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,180
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

873
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,140
Well, actually, and also looking forward a little bit,

874
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,180
what I'm actually really excited for, believe it or not, is Starfield.

875
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,940
Just since I have Game Pass anyway, I'm absolutely going to pick it up.

876
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,380
And I'm excited to see how it turned out.

877
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,820
You know, there's a lot of chat about is this perhaps again?

878
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,180
I guess there's rumors out there because people are playing it right now. Right.

879
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,140
So even though it's embargoed, there is still some stuff getting out

880
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,860
and you take it with a grain of salt.

881
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,180
But one of the things that is getting out is that it is absolutely

882
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,740
the least buggy Bethesda game and that that extra time kind of shows.

883
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,300
So it'll be now again, take it with a big grain of salt, because I think,

884
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,580
you know, who's playing the embargo right now?

885
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,140
Journalists and influencers.

886
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,180
That's who's playing the embargo on right now.

887
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,100
Then when it gets out in front of the rest of the Internet,

888
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,780
they're probably going to find things the others miss.

889
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,260
So I you know, but that's just what some of the early buzz is.

890
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,020
So I'll be very curious.

891
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,540
That reminds me because of space.

892
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,860
One other game I played this week was No Man's Sky just a little bit

893
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,980
because I got my PlayStation version up and running because I was like,

894
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,140
I want to chase some PlayStation five trophies in this game.

895
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,980
I think I'm going to make a new little get the get my trophies in this.

896
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,180
I played just a little bit for a night.

897
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,540
I got like two trophies.

898
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,500
And then I was like, I'm going to stream some of this later.

899
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,300
And then the very next day.

900
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,700
The echoes update came out and added all the new stuff.

901
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,740
And so it was like, oh, well, if I stream this again, I'm going to.

902
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:42,380
And then I got sidetracked to like Dragon Con stuff and IRL stuff.

903
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,700
So I haven't really been streaming,

904
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,940
even though No Man's Sky has a whole twitch drop thing going on again right now,

905
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,180
which I'd love to participate in.

906
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,580
But it's just really bad timing.

907
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,180
It's a bummer. But yeah.

908
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,380
Yeah. Questmaster says the echoes update is so massive.

909
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,380
I guess they added a fourth alien race. That's huge.

910
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,740
That's pretty incredible.

911
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,420
So I'm I look forward to checking it out at some point.

912
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,860
Anyway, let's get into some other gaming news.

913
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:07,700
What else is going on around the industry?

914
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,660
I'm going to take it to Loki to start us off tonight

915
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:13,860
with a little bit of a wrap up of what happened at Gamescom.

916
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,660
And I'm very sorry I need to step away for a moment, but take it away, Loki.

917
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,620
Yeah. So with Gamescom, of course, we had opening night live,

918
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,100
which was with Jeff Keighley.

919
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,500
And with that, of course, lots of new trailers for different game titles.

920
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,860
Some of these, of course, just coming out recently.

921
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,820
So, for example, we got a launch trailer for Armored Core 6, Fires of Rubicon.

922
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,780
Which launched this Friday and looks awesome.

923
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,420
I need to pick it up.

924
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,420
Alan Wake 2 got a new trailer as well.

925
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,460
It looks pretty sweet.

926
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,020
We got the announcement that Age of Empires 4 anniversary edition

927
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,900
is now on Xbox Series X and S.

928
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,180
Aura History Untold looked pretty cool.

929
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,820
A live action Starfield trailer.

930
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,380
I'm assuming this is the launch trailer for that as well,

931
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,420
since this comes out literally in a couple of weeks here.

932
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,620
Yeah, on the 6th, actually.

933
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,460
So that's pretty nice.

934
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,460
And what else?

935
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,180
Another cool stuff.

936
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,140
Assassin's Creed Mirage gameplay.

937
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,100
That looks pretty cool.

938
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,700
Black Myth Wukong.

939
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,340
I think we've seen this before.

940
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,260
It looks interesting.

941
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,740
It's kind of that whole Chinese mythology, like an action RPG.

942
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,700
I want to say we saw that around E3 time as well.

943
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,100
Call of Duty Modern Warfare got some story gameplay.

944
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:43,340
It showed off the first mission in the game and looks pretty cool.

945
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,420
I try to think back to the original Modern Warfare 3

946
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,540
and the mission in that if it's actually like a direct remake

947
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,900
or if they're just kind of doing something else.

948
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,460
I don't recall it, though.

949
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,180
I know I played through it and it was a great game.

950
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,780
So I'm kind of curious, maybe I should check this out.

951
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,780
Crew Motorfest had also another launch

952
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,220
or had a launch trailer as well that's coming out on September 14th.

953
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,300
Crimson Desert got a trailer

954
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:15,940
and it's showing off some of the new gameplay as well.

955
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,980
Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty had another trailer as well.

956
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,140
We just got one of those at Summer Games Fest.

957
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,300
Dustborne kind of looks interesting, very cool, a stylized looking game.

958
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,700
Kind of reminds me a little bit of Sunset Overdrive, but

959
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,580
very cool looking.

960
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,460
Diablo 4 got the Season of Blood announcement as well.

961
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,540
Talking about that.

962
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,700
Genshin Impact had a trailer as well as Honkai Star Rail,

963
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,180
the announcement trailer for PlayStation 5.

964
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,940
And then we've got Mudrunner or Expeditions Mudrunner.

965
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:02,140
There is a premiere for that, and that's the game that's by Snowrunner as well.

966
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,300
Snowrunner is kind of a very extremely realistic off-roading game,

967
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,980
if I remember correctly, and that's coming out next year.

968
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,540
Granblue Fantasy Relink, a new JRPG,

969
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:20,380
and that's supposed to be coming out on February 1st, 2024.

970
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,540
What else? The First Descendant.

971
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,860
Looks pretty cool looking.

972
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,100
A lot of these games are never going to play though, unfortunately.

973
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:36,260
Fort Solace, which, of course, has Troy Baker, Juliet Brown, Roger Clark.

974
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:41,420
And, you know, very story driven game there.

975
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,380
Mortals of Avium.

976
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,740
Looks like that's a Magic based FPS game.

977
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,060
Very interested to play that.

978
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,220
You know, once again, gives me the old heretic Hexen vibes, of course.

979
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,780
And I think it's coming out later this year.

980
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:02,020
We had Killing Floor 3

981
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:07,660
got a pretty cool cinematic trailer as well.

982
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,660
Little Nightmares 3, didn't even realize they had a third sequel for that,

983
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,020
but that's going to be coming out next year as well.

984
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:20,660
The Lords of Fallen remake that is going to got a brand new story trailer.

985
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,100
Is that a remake? I actually maybe that's just a new RPG.

986
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,620
I thought there was a Lords of Fallen game.

987
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,020
I swear that that sounds awfully familiar,

988
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,500
but that is going to be coming out as well.

989
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,780
This is kind of cool.

990
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,540
I mean, once again, a game I don't necessarily play, but I'm aware of Marvel Snap.

991
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,780
They had a cool cinematic trailer that they put out for that.

992
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,260
Honestly, I'll take just like the Marvel Snap animated

993
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,580
like show at this point.

994
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,980
I mean, with Deadpool in there and all the different iterations

995
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,180
and all the anime style.

996
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,340
Yes, please give me some like anime Marvel stuff.

997
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,020
I'm down for that with Squirrel Girl and all that.

998
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,020
So please.

999
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,860
Moral Combat 1, they had a new trailer for that as well.

1000
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:08,060
And kind of also clean up the fatalities and whatnot.

1001
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,220
And I just I just want to say that when they announced

1002
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,140
Sindel, the gays cried out. Yes.

1003
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,860
Because I know I'm very excited to see Sindel back.

1004
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,780
And she's she's like the right kind of Sindel.

1005
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,820
Oh, she's does that make sense?

1006
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,820
No, she's stunning. She's good guy, Sindel.

1007
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,700
Yeah, no, she's good guy, Sindel.

1008
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,820
Oh, yeah, because yeah, because they you know, they're

1009
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,860
they're having fun with the reboot. Yeah.

1010
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:36,900
Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,140
I've watched like the whole 17 minutes of that game.

1012
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,780
Are you going to jump?

1013
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,980
I imagine Mortal Combat 1 is out on Steam, so you ought to be able to.

1014
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,180
It's got to be on cloud somewhere.

1015
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,420
Are you going to jump in on Mortal Combat 1, Jamie?

1016
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,900
I'm probably going to watch a lot of other people play it.

1017
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,100
OK, fair enough.

1018
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,220
It does have me like I don't like Mortal Combat

1019
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,340
just because I'm not really a big fighting game fan anyways,

1020
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,380
but when it came down like Street Fighter, Mortal Combat,

1021
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,220
like I definitely was more Street Fighter.

1022
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,180
I mean, I do like the DLC characters that they have, like both Homelander

1023
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,220
and what's his name from?

1024
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,980
From Invincible.

1025
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,300
I don't remember his name.

1026
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,060
It it looks incredible.

1027
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,900
So Omni Man, Omni Man, thank you.

1028
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,020
I couldn't remember.

1029
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:28,620
I will say this.

1030
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,700
I thought we had this on our show, but I guess I bumped it for something else.

1031
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,540
But dark to see a reminds me.

1032
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:37,020
Apparently, the fatalities all have descriptive audio.

1033
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,940
And yeah, I saw you and it's hilarious.

1034
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,900
It's great. It's great.

1035
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:42,780
It's pretty awesome.

1036
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,700
This British lady

1037
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,260
hiding it in such a flat monotone.

1038
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,700
That's right.

1039
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,500
And now we want to see that he's written.

1040
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,700
So she reaches for his for his neck and the spine breaks

1041
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,020
and you see the blood coming out through the X-ray.

1042
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,180
It's great.

1043
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,580
That's what she sounds like.

1044
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,660
I love it. I love that.

1045
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,700
That needs to be a staple in like all the fighting games. Mm hmm.

1046
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,300
But I mean, I mean, as

1047
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,500
and I want to point out, even though we're kind of laughing at it,

1048
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,460
because it's kind of like the it's like the absurdity of these games brought to life

1049
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,620
from an accessibility standpoint, that is bold, underlined, italic,

1050
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,940
fucking awesome that they're doing that, you know, and even though we're having to.

1051
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:26,340
Yeah, it's just we're teeing it because it brings the absurdity of Mortal Combat

1052
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,580
really just to the front and center and lays it on the table, you know.

1053
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,340
It's the voice, though.

1054
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,700
It's the lady's voice that does it for me.

1055
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,860
But it's and so after a knee to the groin, he doubles over in pain

1056
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,100
when she uses the opportunity to then bash his head in with a mallet.

1057
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,660
I like it.

1058
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,140
It definitely sounds like and I hate to do a South Park.

1059
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,460
My impression is good.

1060
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,820
I hope I hate to do a South Park reference in the year 2023.

1061
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,860
But it definitely reminds me of that one

1062
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,460
episode of like, thank you for calling the Worcestershire sauce company.

1063
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,300
If you're having a problem with Worcestershire, it's like that whole

1064
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,380
when I think they're turned into town into zombies or something.

1065
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,700
And it was very cool, collected British lady.

1066
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,700
It sounded like that in the

1067
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,860
trailers or the this audio description anyway. And.

1068
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,220
She sounds very bought.

1069
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,500
Yes, Bonsobo six says the fans went wild for Sandel.

1070
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,220
I saw so many streamers calling her new mommy.

1071
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,780
Yes, that is Sandel's mother.

1072
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,060
Yes, she's mother is mothering.

1073
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,500
Although I am very curious now with the changes with the whole

1074
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,220
Tarkatan thing, like what's what's Molina's deal? Mm hmm.

1075
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,820
So I'm into it like that was for me.

1076
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,100
I love the story.

1077
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:46,180
I just I I haven't played a Mortal Combat game

1078
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,580
and had fun since, you know, Mortal Combat.

1079
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,140
Two for a hot minute, actually, Mortal Combat two

1080
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,780
is probably still the pinnacle of Mortal Combat for me.

1081
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,860
I mean, same, but yeah.

1082
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,220
Let's see what else we had some Sonic stuff.

1083
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,020
So Sonic Frontiers, the final horizon is going to be, I think, a bit of

1084
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,780
DLC or an update that they're going to be getting.

1085
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,620
And they showed off that it has new stories and new playable characters.

1086
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,340
Sonic Superstars had another new trailer as well, showing off

1087
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,460
some of the co-op gameplay with that.

1088
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,860
We got a new trailer for Tekken eight,

1089
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:25,140
which showed off its arcade simulation mode

1090
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,420
under the waves.

1091
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,740
Got a new trailer as well, which is actually that game's

1092
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,860
coming out this week, so we'll have to check that out.

1093
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,660
This trailer absolutely blew me away.

1094
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,140
I need to play this game.

1095
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:43,980
I hope it's not just for PlayStation, because it was on the PlayStation Japan

1096
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:48,940
YouTube page, but it's called Thank Goodness You're Here.

1097
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,700
It is a hand drawn animated game.

1098
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,620
I don't know what it is, but it looks strange and I love it.

1099
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,260
I love the art style.

1100
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,660
I love the humor of it.

1101
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,500
I want this game now.

1102
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,300
Like, it looks amazing.

1103
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,380
And I think that's supposed to be coming out next year at some point.

1104
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,740
So cross my fingers that it's not just Sony.

1105
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,820
What else?

1106
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,140
We had a non-video game stuff

1107
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:19,340
with the Netflix trailer for Zack Snyder's

1108
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,300
new movie or movies with Rebel Moon.

1109
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,820
That is going to be coming out, I think, next year or later this year

1110
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,500
or something like that.

1111
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,660
I just want to get a couple of quick comments.

1112
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,620
Interesting.

1113
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:33,300
Orange Right says there's a trailer for Thank Goodness You're Here

1114
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,620
on Nintendo's YouTube.

1115
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:39,500
So, OK, good. OK, so it is on multiple consoles, but it looks fantastic.

1116
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,660
Like, absolutely.

1117
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,580
Watch the trailer if you haven't done it yet.

1118
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,500
It's just like it's it's almost Monty Python ish.

1119
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,700
It looks very similar to tell what I'm bringing up on the other screen.

1120
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,660
Sorry, because I want to take a look at this myself

1121
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,940
because I wasn't able to watch the live event.

1122
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,540
I think like some of you were able to.

1123
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,780
So, yeah, it's absolutely cool looking like this is the game that

1124
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,060
looks the most interesting to me.

1125
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,100
Yeah, it definitely looks like a full on cartoon.

1126
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,180
But I mean, that's what games are capable of doing these days.

1127
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,220
So that's very interesting.

1128
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,940
It just looks weird and I like weird.

1129
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:18,260
So OK, I'm down for this.

1130
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,860
It looks just strange.

1131
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,140
All right, let's check that out.

1132
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,420
Mike Deft is also asking,

1133
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,940
have you seen the trailer for Killer Bean, the game that is up your alley?

1134
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,380
I have seen so.

1135
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:33,500
OK, I'm not familiar with Killer Bean as like a YouTube series.

1136
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,140
I understand it is very old, obviously,

1137
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,020
but it sounds like the game is really cool, like very like they said

1138
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,540
compared to like John Wick and stuff.

1139
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,420
So I cool.

1140
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,340
I will have to check it out, but I'm not familiar with the Killer Bean lore.

1141
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,300
But that does look extremely cool.

1142
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,180
And I'm glad that it's getting its own game.

1143
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:57,740
I mean, this whole ridiculousness of shooting from a car,

1144
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,460
then jumping out on your jet pack and shooting from your jet pack

1145
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,620
and then on the ground and shooting for your guns on the ground.

1146
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,940
It does seem very low key to me.

1147
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,140
It's OK.

1148
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,620
So it's very much Saints Row.

1149
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,180
Just cause, you know, granted,

1150
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,900
dark like all smashed into one. Exactly.

1151
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,540
So here's the thing is like, OK, well, if I can't get my Saints

1152
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:23,220
Row gameplay from Saints Row, I'm just going to have to get it from Killer Bean

1153
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,220
then, like this is the type of stuff that you should be doing.

1154
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,940
Look, it's ridiculous.

1155
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:31,700
I don't mean to be shady, but this looks like the game that this looks like

1156
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:35,540
the kind of game that has a great trailer and then gets a 34 on Metacritic.

1157
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,420
Not that Metacritic is the end all be all, but it just it

1158
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,100
it kind of looks like one of those games that I again, maybe I'll be wrong.

1159
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,180
It's just one of those games that probably actually runs like, oh, sure.

1160
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,220
Like, honestly, it doesn't look super great.

1161
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,180
Like it does look like PlayStation three era stuff. We'll see. We'll see.

1162
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:55,220
But I mean, is the game plays there?

1163
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,460
All right. Anyway, sorry.

1164
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,060
You were talking about non game related things, Loki, like the Netflix stuff.

1165
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,620
Yeah. So, yeah, Rebel Moon.

1166
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,340
There's going to be two.

1167
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:07,820
It's a Zack Snyder film and it's supposed to be like R rated Star Wars type of thing.

1168
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,420
I mean, it's very Star Wars looking.

1169
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:14,140
And also there's unicorn or not.

1170
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,580
It was a unicorn or no, it was a Griffin.

1171
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,860
There's like a Griffin thing.

1172
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,100
And they're supposed to be split up in two movies.

1173
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,940
And he has like a director's cut, which is five hours long as well,

1174
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,780
because, you know, it's Zack Snyder and that's the kind of thing he does.

1175
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,900
So that'll be coming out at some point.

1176
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:34,220
Um, well, so we had a trailer for Payday three

1177
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,180
with Ice-T making a cameo in that.

1178
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,620
Oh, I guess, um, Nightingale.

1179
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,940
It's a horror card based survival game.

1180
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,020
So that looks interesting.

1181
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,740
And I think that was it.

1182
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,140
Oh, Last Epoch.

1183
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,020
They showed some gameplay footage from that as well.

1184
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,380
And that there was some dude that ran up

1185
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,460
on stage and asked about Grand Theft Auto six,

1186
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,980
because Jeff Keighley has poor security at his events

1187
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:08,420
and people just rust the stage now.

1188
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,380
Yeah, that was going to get hurt.

1189
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,220
Well, I was really messed up, though, to be quite honest, like.

1190
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,740
We should be past this point.

1191
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,380
You know what I mean?

1192
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:21,140
Like, it's let the man have a taser on stage at this point, to be honest.

1193
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,940
Or just like better security.

1194
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,980
Like, how are these people getting in these events?

1195
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,300
Like, honestly, like

1196
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,420
who are these people that are just getting in and you're just like

1197
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,820
they're letting them run up on stage and like, OK, cool.

1198
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:37,340
Anybody can do this now.

1199
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:39,820
Now it's happened twice and now people are going to try even harder.

1200
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:43,500
Yeah, like you got to you got to get this stuff under control, man.

1201
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,500
Yeah, it's for your own safety.

1202
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,180
I mean, because like what if someone's just really mad at you

1203
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,580
and then they decide, oh, hey, I'm just going to go kill him,

1204
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:54,140
you know, rush up on stage and like, you know,

1205
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:58,860
because I want to make a scene and and be infamous that way, like.

1206
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,620
You got to get that stuff under control. Yeah.

1207
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:07,100
All right, well, I think they were right to maybe temper

1208
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,140
the expectations a little bit, but I think by doing so, they ended up

1209
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,580
having a fairly successful like, you know, I think they delivered

1210
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:14,380
on what they promised.

1211
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,140
It was updates on games and a few interesting new things.

1212
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,380
I think they set the expectations very well.

1213
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:25,180
And that's that's definitely a hint for what to do in the future, for sure.

1214
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,100
So, yeah, because I think they were like saying, like, listen,

1215
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,300
we're not going to be announcing like another Zelda Breath of the Wild.

1216
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,540
Here's the kingdom nonsense that, you know, like really simmered

1217
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,260
those expectations down.

1218
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,340
Yeah, we'll save that for, you know, the game awards as well.

1219
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:42,260
Well, now it's all that stuff which is going to be happening.

1220
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,740
And, you know, it was confirmed it's happening,

1221
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,500
but that really shouldn't be a surprise, right? So, yeah.

1222
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,460
All right. Moving on.

1223
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,500
Let's talk about some other news

1224
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,860
that came out around the same time this week.

1225
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,300
Let's talk about Arcade 1up, because you'll notice

1226
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,380
if you watch a live on Twitch, I have a couple of these machines.

1227
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,940
I think they're fun.

1228
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,260
Some collectible purists don't care for them.

1229
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,220
I think they're neat.

1230
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:05,700
I think it's fun to have in a little game room.

1231
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,140
I actually I didn't talk about during my game week, gaming week,

1232
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:10,580
but I did play my Tron machine a little bit this week.

1233
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,660
So I do actually play them once in a while.

1234
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,060
Not all the time, but I do. I do actually play them.

1235
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,900
And, you know, many of you who do watch live notice

1236
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,660
I have the perfect amount of space for a third machine,

1237
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:24,900
although I'd probably have to move the couch if I did it.

1238
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,140
And that's my napping couch.

1239
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:31,020
I don't know how I feel about that, but I have my couch looks familiar.

1240
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,460
I it from my mom's place.

1241
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,660
No, the ones that used to be yours downstairs. Yeah.

1242
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,300
No. OK. Yeah.

1243
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,780
A moment. It looks like it.

1244
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,100
But yeah. So this

1245
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,820
space at some point will get filled in.

1246
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:51,260
And there's a really good contender here for what they announced this week.

1247
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:56,940
And that is a time crisis machine that is coming out for six hundred dollars.

1248
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,260
But here's the thing.

1249
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,620
Time crisis is the main game in it and what everything is kind of labeled as.

1250
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:03,580
But guess what?

1251
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:06,700
Since it is a Namco game with light guns,

1252
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,620
guess what's in the the list of other games?

1253
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:14,660
Point blank is also in the time crisis machine.

1254
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,860
Oh, no, I don't need to know this.

1255
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,220
I don't want to know this.

1256
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,900
I know that's the bucket list right there.

1257
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,300
I know. But here's the thing.

1258
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,340
It's not point blank and point blank, too. So.

1259
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,740
But yeah, that's I know.

1260
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,700
So it's time crisis point blank.

1261
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:35,940
Steel Gunner and Steel Gunner two are what make up this cabinet here.

1262
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:39,900
So, yeah, if they did a point blank branded one

1263
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:43,060
with both point blanks in it, because I think there was only two in the arcade.

1264
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,020
Right. There was a they have a new one now as well.

1265
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,300
Oh, they have a ticket game, don't they?

1266
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,260
No, it's not a ticket game. It's called Gum Bullet.

1267
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:54,340
It's it's a new one that they actually have at the round one near us

1268
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,700
because I've played it there.

1269
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:00,500
OK, but yeah, it's it's not a ticket game either.

1270
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:05,020
Well, there were some other machines that were announced as well worth pointing out.

1271
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,980
Galaga is another machine coming.

1272
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:10,060
But these are these are kind of just rebranding of things

1273
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,580
they've already put out, to be quite honest.

1274
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,140
Galaga is going to release Galaga again.

1275
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:18,020
I mean, honestly, like that in Pac-Man, they've kind of done this machine before.

1276
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,460
It's just all the big Namco hits, but it's just the Galaga branding now in a full.

1277
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,060
I think this might be a full size.

1278
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,900
Oh, that's what it is. It's a deluxe.

1279
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,500
So it's a full size cab as opposed to the ones behind me are actually what?

1280
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,740
Three quarter of the, you know, normal size.

1281
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:35,020
And speaking of deluxe, a Street Fighter two deluxe.

1282
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,820
Again, they've had a regular, but the full size machine is coming later this year.

1283
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,740
Also kind of interesting.

1284
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:44,300
Wheel of Fortune.

1285
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,540
They have casino machines.

1286
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,140
Oh, yeah. The Wheel of Fortune machine is apparently legit.

1287
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,980
Like it's it's interesting.

1288
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:52,140
This machine looked interesting to me, too.

1289
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:56,300
It's an Atari 50th anniversary deluxe machine.

1290
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,140
The only thing I like what they're putting in it.

1291
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:05,900
I just don't like the look like I can only take so much of that Atari 50 logo.

1292
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:11,740
And I really wish they'd kept the 50 maybe on the riser and on the marquee.

1293
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,580
But maybe done a compilation of Atari are on the side.

1294
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:20,780
I don't just like white panel the side and then like an Atari logo or something like that.

1295
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,940
So I don't love the look of this thing.

1296
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:27,460
But this thing apparently does have quite a few games in it

1297
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,220
because it actually has 50 Atari 2600 games.

1298
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:34,580
That's a first for these cabs to have the console games actually in them.

1299
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:38,660
And then it has their typical I mean, they've had Atari arcade one ups before,

1300
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,300
whether it was branded centipede or the branded Tempest.

1301
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,060
It pretty much has the usual lineups in there no matter what.

1302
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,220
But the fact that it's deluxe means it's going to be a big one and so on and so on.

1303
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,340
So yeah, like I like the machine in theory.

1304
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,740
I just don't like how it looks.

1305
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,460
So I kind of I kind of hope there's a refresh of that, to be honest,

1306
01:07:57,460 --> 01:08:00,660
because I might get it if they were to put out one that looked a little different.

1307
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:04,900
So. But yeah, that was some news out of arcade one up.

1308
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:10,820
So fun, fun for the collectors that like to drop this way for the point blank.

1309
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,460
When they come out eventually.

1310
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,540
All right. Well, speaking of honestly,

1311
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:18,420
you could probably just buy a point blank at this point.

1312
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,300
I mean, I mean, yeah, honestly. Yeah. Like.

1313
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,540
I wonder how they get. Yeah, you'd have to find one.

1314
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,860
I wonder how hard it would be to fix if it was broken.

1315
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,340
But I guess there's no specialty.

1316
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:37,540
Like there's some glass shops that actually sell the tubes for a CRT

1317
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:39,860
and transistors for, you know, classic

1318
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,940
audio receivers and whatnot.

1319
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,660
Yeah, I need to have someone come repair my my monitor in my

1320
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,660
Astra City because it is no worky.

1321
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,420
Oh, that's a bummer.

1322
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,380
Yeah. All right.

1323
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:58,220
Well, speaking of anticipated releases, Dark Soccer's next story is about one.

1324
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,100
Well, it's more about what happens when you jump the gun.

1325
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:09,460
So there's been, you know, talk and speculation about Starfield coming out

1326
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:16,220
and a guy has been arrested and charged with theft of the game.

1327
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,540
It is a 29 year old.

1328
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:24,180
Darren Harris posted the first 45 minutes of the game online.

1329
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,700
And of course, it was taken down from YouTube, but people were still sharing it.

1330
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,940
He also posted listings for additional copies of the game.

1331
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:38,540
And there were videos of him going to FedEx to pay to ship it.

1332
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,900
The affidavit was filed in Shelby County

1333
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:47,580
and the Memphis Police Department

1334
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,980
were also reached out to by head of security and loss prevention

1335
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,460
at Vantiva, formerly Technicolor,

1336
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,220
telling them about the theft and that some of the victims

1337
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,900
about the theft and that Starfield was not available for release until September 6th.

1338
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:07,820
Of course, they basically with

1339
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,580
the two facilities working together,

1340
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:16,980
they were able to get a search warrant and search through Harris's home.

1341
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,980
They found a FedEx package sealed with a copy of the game

1342
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:26,700
for Xbox Series Starfield games and two Xbox Series upgrade editions

1343
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:31,900
and three handguns and some pot that one of the handguns was stolen.

1344
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:36,180
So he was arrested on August 24th.

1345
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,580
So just a couple of days ago.

1346
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,540
Now, he told the police, Harris that is, told the police

1347
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:45,460
that he purchased the game from an unknown individual.

1348
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:49,460
But anyway, he was charged with felony

1349
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,220
theft of property between twenty five hundred and ten thousand dollars.

1350
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:57,540
Misdemeanor, theft and misdemeanor possession of a controlled substance.

1351
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,420
Oh, that's right. It's not legal there.

1352
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,180
Yeah, I was going to say, the marijuana charge is bullshit,

1353
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,860
but the rest of it is, you know.

1354
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:06,980
Yeah, he's got a bond of ten thousand dollars,

1355
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:10,220
which is posted on this past Friday.

1356
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,620
And yeah, so.

1357
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:20,860
Yeah, he got caught in this day and age, it's almost impossible not to get caught.

1358
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,140
Well, especially when you're filming yourself doing it

1359
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,180
and being so brazen about it, that's the thing.

1360
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:29,020
It he, you know, to be clear, he's not they're entitled to it.

1361
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:33,220
Yeah, he's not arrested for broadcasting the game early on YouTube.

1362
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,060
That's a very hard thing to.

1363
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,740
And plus, that would be really a criminal thing.

1364
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:39,580
That could be a civil thing, but it wouldn't be something this quick.

1365
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:45,460
It's the whole like essentially the FedExing video is that that's the problem,

1366
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,380
because, you know, in order for this thing to be in this guy's possession,

1367
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,020
it would have had to have been stolen.

1368
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,940
As they point out, it was not set to release until September six.

1369
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,220
This person I am imagining is not an official distributor of the product.

1370
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:02,660
Therefore, there's only one way that this individual gets the product.

1371
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:05,060
Now, whether he stole it or somebody stole it for him,

1372
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:10,300
he's still in possession of it and trying to sell it and filming himself doing so.

1373
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,660
And that's a crime.

1374
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:16,220
And I just want to point out that the same guy is not the same dude

1375
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,860
who's the CEO of Jack in the Box.

1376
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:22,500
I did not know that the CEO of Jack in the Box had the same name,

1377
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:27,540
which is ironic when you consider the type of food the Jack in the Box sells.

1378
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:31,300
But I all of it fried, even the tacos are deep fried.

1379
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,380
It's disgusting.

1380
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,580
It's it's stoner food.

1381
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:34,340
That's all it is.

1382
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:34,980
Jack in the box.

1383
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,420
It's just call it's they should just call it four twenty six nine

1384
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,460
because that is what Jack in the Box food is.

1385
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,300
They had a they had a was it one of those

1386
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:47,260
was it one of those

1387
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,860
late night meals or whatever that's put together by Snoop Dogg.

1388
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,780
They know who their audience is.

1389
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:58,180
So there's a post on Twitter right now

1390
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:02,380
saying the leaker who posted Starfield gameplay has been arrested for theft.

1391
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,660
Looks like he stole the Xbox Series X constellation edition

1392
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:07,940
of Starfield from the warehouse.

1393
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:11,020
Not good. Not good.

1394
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,940
Yeah. And he went and leaked the gameplay.

1395
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,620
Yeah, that's that's where it gets bold.

1396
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:21,500
And he put up a response video said, Todd, no offense, man.

1397
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:22,780
That's a good game. Yeah. Yeah.

1398
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,500
That's what the questions were just put in chat.

1399
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,900
It's it's not just that he said that, but apparently he was smoking

1400
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:32,900
some of the other substance in the video and then was like, that's a good game.

1401
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:37,100
Todd, like there it you can be nice about it, but you still stole it.

1402
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:39,660
That's yeah.

1403
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:42,220
I just still think that's a funny, you know, end cap.

1404
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:45,700
It is what's it's also kind of one of those like I

1405
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,540
I wonder if the dude's a little troubled,

1406
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:52,740
you know, to be so bold for some of it, like it almost strikes me

1407
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:57,140
as a call for attention and help like and that's where this kind of gets less funny

1408
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:00,540
is it's you know, how much of this was doing it for the profit

1409
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,620
and how much of it was doing it for some type of.

1410
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,940
Acknowledgement or something, you know, it's just it's unfortunate.

1411
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:12,020
Anyway, in brighter news,

1412
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,020
maybe in the legal world, I don't know what to think of this.

1413
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:17,220
But Loki. Yeah.

1414
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,820
So as I guess an additional step to try to get past the whole

1415
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:26,460
UK regulatory boards, the Competition and Markets Authority,

1416
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:31,980
Microsoft has announced that they are going to be partnering with Ubisoft

1417
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:35,180
plus to stream their

1418
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,060
will hopefully acquired Activision games

1419
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:41,900
upon completion of the merger.

1420
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:46,340
So they made a deal with them for 15 years.

1421
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:51,780
And I think also I think they can also renegotiate that later.

1422
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,780
But it's yeah, basically allowing them to.

1423
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:00,460
So they're not exclusively going to be on the Microsoft platforms,

1424
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:05,300
I think is what the main goal of that is basically saying, yeah, this is

1425
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:09,580
to address the concerns and impact of the proposed acquisition

1426
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:14,580
on cloud gaming or cloud game streaming raised by the UK competitive

1427
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,700
and markets authority.

1428
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:21,300
We are restructuring the transaction to acquire a narrower, narrower set of rights.

1429
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:25,020
This includes excluding or executing an agreement effective

1430
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:28,660
at the closing of our merger that transfers the cloud streaming rights

1431
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:33,220
for all current and new Activision, Blizzard, PC and console games

1432
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,340
released over the next 15 years to Ubisoft.

1433
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:42,060
A leading global game publisher, the rights will be in perpetuity,

1434
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:45,180
so they're giving them the rights for any of the games that are coming

1435
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,260
within the next 15 years.

1436
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:49,140
So I'm wondering, does that mean that they're not going to be streaming

1437
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:53,580
those on the cloud service or they're just adding them to that?

1438
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,980
I'm not I'm curious to see what they were being added to it,

1439
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,180
that it was something that the Ubisoft plus platform

1440
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:04,020
be able to integrate, just like because they already have the deals with

1441
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:09,620
some of the other cloud companies over there in the UK for that stuff.

1442
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,660
So I want to say Amazon's was one of them and

1443
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,900
some of the other big ones over there,

1444
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,660
the one the one that Dark Sakura used to use before she switched.

1445
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,660
I can't remember the name of it.

1446
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:23,260
You know what would be funny is they they make you're a gamer.

1447
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,340
No, they make that the UK streaming site.

1448
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,260
You like them. Oh, Boosteroid.

1449
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,940
That's it. Boosteroid. That was it.

1450
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:30,820
I couldn't remember the name.

1451
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:35,380
It'd be it'd be funny if like the whole this is like a big trick.

1452
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,860
And, you know, basically you're saying, oh, yeah, we're going to give the rights

1453
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:41,500
to Ubisoft plus, you know, in perpetuity to have this.

1454
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,780
And then they've already made a deal with Ubisoft to include the Ubisoft

1455
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,660
plus as part of Game Pass, like that would be funny.

1456
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:51,220
Who's somebody more problematic than us that we can give the rights to?

1457
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:55,020
I mean, this is this is just it's a Hail Mary play.

1458
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,380
They this this is it.

1459
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,340
This is the one thing that's standing between them and getting this deal

1460
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:03,140
to go through and they know it hinges on cloud stuff.

1461
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,380
And so they're like, you know what?

1462
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:07,380
We're going to go to our one of our biggest competitors.

1463
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:09,180
Like it was it was this or EA.

1464
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,020
And I don't think EA is set up in this.

1465
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,180
I don't think Origin does the cloud stuff.

1466
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:16,460
So they went over to Ubisoft and said, look,

1467
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:20,860
we're willing to literally give it to you so we can have all this other stuff.

1468
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:25,820
You know, because maybe they're still thinking cloud gaming

1469
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,060
isn't even going to take over still for 15 years.

1470
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,620
You know, probably.

1471
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,820
I mean, maybe it kind of depends on 5G and a lot of that, I think.

1472
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,380
But, you know, I digress a little bit.

1473
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:38,580
It is definitely a Hail Mary play.

1474
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,780
Like they want this to go through and this is this is

1475
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:44,140
they're doing the most that they can do to make this happen.

1476
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,860
Basically. Yeah. Yeah.

1477
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:51,780
Let's see. Quest Buster says you can almost hear Activision

1478
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:57,060
Blizzard's lawyers grunting as they hurled this as far as they could to the end zone.

1479
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:01,420
I mean, typically sports references are lost on me, but that one I get.

1480
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,900
And yes, this it's very that

1481
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:08,980
this is very much a.

1482
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,620
You know, go go long type of thing.

1483
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:13,380
All right.

1484
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:17,180
Speaking of things in the Microsoft world, you know, there's another game

1485
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,260
we haven't really been talking about enough on this show.

1486
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,180
I just think it hasn't

1487
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:23,380
been a game we've been playing yet.

1488
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:26,860
I know it's something I plan to jump into probably when I'm back from DragonCon.

1489
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,700
But I've watched a lot of my friends streaming this one.

1490
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:31,860
And this is Baldur's Gate three.

1491
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,740
And apparently it is very, very good.

1492
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:37,620
And it's supposed to release on PlayStation on September six.

1493
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,100
That'll be out on PlayStation five.

1494
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,820
But it wasn't going to release on Xbox.

1495
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,460
But that was magically resolved this week.

1496
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:47,540
It sounds like it honestly sounds like at Gamescom,

1497
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:52,180
Larian Studios and Phil Spencer like sat down like this isn't confirmed.

1498
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:55,820
But like you just really get that vibe that Phil Spencer was like.

1499
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,700
How do we make this happen?

1500
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,940
We're going to do it.

1501
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,340
How do we make this happen?

1502
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:03,420
And the answer to how did they make this happen was basically

1503
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:07,500
give us an exception that we do not have to grant feature parody

1504
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,380
on the Xbox Series S.

1505
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:11,780
And that exception was granted.

1506
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,940
Games that release on Xbox Series X

1507
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:19,020
must also run with feature parody on the Xbox Series S.

1508
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:24,020
This game will get an exception to that waiver and cross

1509
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,900
a split screen, excuse me, split screen multiplayer is the feature

1510
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:33,940
that they could not get working with the appropriate amount of quality on the S.

1511
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,740
So it will be cut.

1512
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,140
But they are saying they are going out of their way to say

1513
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,980
it still has cloud based storage and all this.

1514
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,820
So they're like, it still has everything else you can.

1515
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,700
If you started a game on S, you can still transfer it somewhere else later.

1516
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,060
You won't be losing your progress.

1517
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:52,820
But still, I know people that game on series S that will probably be sad.

1518
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:53,780
In fact, there it is.

1519
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,300
Dark Tetsuya says, I mean,

1520
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,340
hate to lose couch co-op because we love gaming together,

1521
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,380
but we'll definitely look out for this.

1522
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:03,660
Well, for what it's worth, I mean, you'd have to spend the money, which sucks.

1523
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:09,020
But you could one of you on the series S and one of you on the computer

1524
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:11,500
and play, you know, across the Internet.

1525
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,820
But it's not the same.

1526
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:18,380
But, well, yeah, people have completely turned me off of that game.

1527
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,260
Oh, really? Yeah.

1528
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:24,660
Just all of the thirst on the Internet and all the oh, sexy scenes, blah, blah.

1529
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,700
I'm like, I'm not interested. Pass.

1530
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,060
Well, there is that, but there's a lot more.

1531
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:34,740
I know there's more to it, but it's just all of the the hoopla about it

1532
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,580
just completely turned me off of it.

1533
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:37,540
I'm not interested.

1534
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:42,260
I mean, I would rather play second edition D&D with my friends at the table.

1535
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:47,740
To me, I would say like Mass Effect, you know, especially with the first game,

1536
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,180
those sex scenes had a lot of attention in the very beginning,

1537
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,540
because remember what was on Fox News and all this stuff about, oh, my God,

1538
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,740
you can fuck an alien because of Liara and all this stuff.

1539
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,420
And it and it was gay alien, too, because femshep could,

1540
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,460
even though Liara's race doesn't have jet.

1541
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:08,300
But anyway, it's it was still everybody was losing their goddamn minds.

1542
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,300
And then it's it's there.

1543
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:13,260
But yeah, but I came into Mass Effect much later.

1544
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,740
That is true. That is true. Yeah. Yeah.

1545
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:19,340
And. It's just like

1546
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:25,620
there is way too much focus on those aspects in games that for,

1547
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:30,020
you know, people who like, no, I just want a good, solid game

1548
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:35,180
with a good, solid story, and I don't need that to advertise it to me, you know?

1549
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:38,580
And I'm not saying, you know, oh, be prudes and blah, blah, blah.

1550
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,700
I'm just saying that for me as an ace person, it completely turned me off.

1551
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:47,660
Well, Questbuster hears you in chat saying as someone that plays BG3,

1552
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:51,420
I'm also tired of seeing so many people gravitating towards the thirst, too,

1553
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:55,060
because there's so much more to do other than that. So, yeah.

1554
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:58,060
All right. Well, let's move on to a console.

1555
01:21:58,060 --> 01:22:01,900
You definitely can't play Baldur's Gate three on, but still might be kind of fun.

1556
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,340
What you mean the one I probably have a couple of of them?

1557
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:10,500
Well, this particular one's a little new, but yeah, I get what you're saying.

1558
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:19,900
There is going to be a recreation of the Atari 2600

1559
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,060
and all of its wood paneled glory

1560
01:22:23,620 --> 01:22:29,180
to be released. It plays games from the 2600 and 7800 consoles.

1561
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,140
Why not the 5200?

1562
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,540
I mean, they are bigger cartridges.

1563
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:35,700
And you just answered it because that was out there on Twitter.

1564
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:39,300
They answered it. It's that. I figured. Yeah, that's OK.

1565
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,100
I have two of those

1566
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,940
with controllers notorious for breaking.

1567
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:49,340
But anyway, the 2600 plus is got the,

1568
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:52,500
you know, the the late 70s, early 80s wood grain.

1569
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:57,100
And it's based off of the four switch model.

1570
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:04,420
It has a reproduction CX40 controller and supports USB power and HDMI.

1571
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:08,020
The logo on it lights up

1572
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,340
and it has a 10 in one cartridge

1573
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:16,340
that has some pretty notable classic games.

1574
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:24,820
So if if for people who've wanted to know

1575
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:30,380
if it's original hardware, like using FPGA or if it's emulation,

1576
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:35,380
it's been vague.

1577
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:41,060
So. It's.

1578
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,420
Most of the games are compatible,

1579
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:49,220
so you should be able just to plug in your your cartridge.

1580
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:54,260
And. It's a.

1581
01:23:55,780 --> 01:24:00,540
It's it's going to be something that you can plug in on an HD screen

1582
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,380
and not have the same input like you would using

1583
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:11,140
like a modified route through an RF out or or

1584
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:16,660
an or composite, because there are the composite mods for the 2600 already.

1585
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,460
But it'll be it'll be good.

1586
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:25,540
And also Atari is producing new titles

1587
01:24:26,220 --> 01:24:29,060
for the old consoles, so that's something there.

1588
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,460
It's supposed to ship in November this year,

1589
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:36,540
and it looks like it's going to sell for one hundred and twenty nine ninety nine.

1590
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,580
And you know what?

1591
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:42,380
Um, I'm curious. I'm curious.

1592
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:48,020
So I'm looking at the list of games that have been tested with it.

1593
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:52,380
There are I'm not seeing any.

1594
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:58,540
OK, one game that's failed a super cobra out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre

1595
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:02,380
isn't isn't working, you know, just for competition with game.

1596
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,460
They're but most of the ones put in there have passed

1597
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,420
and there's a few untested left to left to try.

1598
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:15,540
So and on top of that, that Texas Chainsaw Massacre game was like not

1599
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:18,940
like fully legit, so.

1600
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:23,980
You know, I will say, though, this 2600 plus is

1601
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:28,900
it's it's more interesting than the Atari VCS thing they were trying,

1602
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,740
which I guess is still technically a thing that whole.

1603
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:35,180
I have almost said high end computer, and it wasn't even that.

1604
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:38,060
It was just a computer that was branded Atari.

1605
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,540
This sounds more interesting because at least it leans into the shit

1606
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:42,980
that Atari is known for.

1607
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:46,380
I like the fact that it's twenty six hundred and seventy eight hundred.

1608
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:49,420
Like it's I understand why they had to leave out the fifty two hundred.

1609
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:51,700
But I think it's it's interesting to me.

1610
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:53,540
That's one hundred.

1611
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:56,060
Matt and Chad says most people want to be able to plug and play

1612
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,380
without having to jump through conversion boxes, et cetera,

1613
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:00,900
to make it work on new TVs. I'm kind of in that boat.

1614
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,740
I have a lot of my old Atari cartridges,

1615
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,420
but don't really have an old CRT TV to play it on. Yeah.

1616
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:09,540
I I still worry the price they're asking is a little high,

1617
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:12,340
especially when you put it next to like the flashback consoles.

1618
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:15,380
Now, look, I know the flashbacks run on emulation.

1619
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:19,340
You know, it's it's maybe a different level of collection purity for people.

1620
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,220
I don't know.

1621
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:24,740
But that's my one concern is I feel like the price might be a little high.

1622
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:28,660
But maybe maybe the if the thing is fucking

1623
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,700
sturdy like an old Atari was,

1624
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:33,300
then maybe maybe I'm not giving it enough credit, you know.

1625
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:38,420
So we'll see.

1626
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,220
Of what Rob?

1627
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:42,660
I was going to say, if you think about it,

1628
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:47,740
the original cost of the Atari twenty six hundred was one hundred

1629
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:51,900
and eighty nine ninety five, which as of two thousand

1630
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,620
twenty two would be the equivalent equivalent of nine hundred and twenty dollars.

1631
01:26:56,620 --> 01:27:00,220
So technically you're getting this cheaper than the original.

1632
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,940
But if the original hardware is still in this thing,

1633
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:08,340
which is still under debate, I guess so.

1634
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:11,340
But it's it's interesting. I mean, don't get me wrong.

1635
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:15,500
I still kind of maybe want one like I just I do love retro games

1636
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,860
and I love that stuff.

1637
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:20,420
I don't think I have a lot of Atari twenty six hundred cartridges anymore.

1638
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:25,140
I mean, and I like I couldn't lend you a handful of them or a box full.

1639
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:28,660
And they're usually pretty easy to find at like estate sales

1640
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,740
and garage sales and stuff.

1641
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,700
Most people don't really know the value of them.

1642
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,740
And there's but I the only interesting thing is, I wonder

1643
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:38,060
if machines like this that will now play the games all over again.

1644
01:27:38,220 --> 01:27:41,140
I wonder if it'll actually cause the cost of some cartridges to go up.

1645
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:44,100
I don't know. It could be interesting. Maybe. Yeah.

1646
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:45,740
So. All right.

1647
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:50,700
Well, let's move on to another console that was announced this week.

1648
01:27:50,980 --> 01:27:53,140
Oh, gosh, this thing looks stupid.

1649
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:56,700
I mean, honestly, it's so it's a PlayStation five.

1650
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,900
They're remote gameplay console.

1651
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,740
It's called the PlayStation Portal.

1652
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:04,220
It is for the PlayStation five.

1653
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:08,980
It allows you to do the remote play with it, and it's two hundred dollars.

1654
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,820
So here's the fun things they can't do.

1655
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:16,900
One, it you can only use PlayStation

1656
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,380
Bluetooth headphones with it.

1657
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,940
You cannot use your own Bluetooth headphones with it.

1658
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,300
It does have a three point five millimeter audio jack,

1659
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,220
so you can plug in your own headphones if you have those.

1660
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,740
Thanks. How gracious of you.

1661
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:35,340
It only works over Wi-Fi.

1662
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:38,340
And I think you have to be.

1663
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,700
You have, of course, you have to have your PlayStation five connected

1664
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:47,340
and plugged in, turned on, connected to the Internet in order to do that.

1665
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:51,100
It's just it's a very, very narrow use case.

1666
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:54,220
For this one, you know.

1667
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:58,220
I'm pretty sure a steam deck can run PlayStation

1668
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:02,060
streaming as well, for at least on PC.

1669
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,660
And then on top of that, like it can't play games natively.

1670
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:09,020
You have to be connected to a PlayStation five.

1671
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:11,860
It just doesn't seem very well.

1672
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:15,660
And they even have things for your cell phone where you can get

1673
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:19,220
basically a controller that straps to your cell phone

1674
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,700
that allows you to kind of create something similar to this

1675
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:24,220
without buying a dedicated device. So.

1676
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:28,900
I don't really understand what this is for.

1677
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:35,300
Yeah, I don't know about this.

1678
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:39,220
It's it's a little too many, a few too many restrictions for me.

1679
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:43,660
Like I feel I feel like they're like trying to capitalize on the switch,

1680
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:47,860
but not understanding what makes the switch so popular.

1681
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:52,660
Like, yeah, it's it's also ugly looking, too, like it's a big, huge

1682
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:55,540
it's like a tablet with controllers stuck to the side.

1683
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,180
That part doesn't bother me nearly as much.

1684
01:29:57,180 --> 01:29:59,460
Like, I think it's just one of those things where it's like the whole fact

1685
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:03,820
that it it has no memory or way to play the game

1686
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,300
unless you're still in your own house.

1687
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,180
Like, I feel like it limits the use case so bad

1688
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:14,340
because, you know, with the Nintendo Switch, you can play it in a car

1689
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:18,860
or a bus or public transit or a plane or going anywhere, you know,

1690
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:21,500
or a hotel room like it's just so damn convenient.

1691
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,860
You can pick it up and take it anywhere.

1692
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,340
This doesn't really let you do that.

1693
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:28,500
Now, maybe if it had some type of.

1694
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:33,140
Connection where you could tap into the hotel's Wi-Fi

1695
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:36,460
and play your PS5 at home on Wi-Fi, I don't think it would be very good.

1696
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:38,980
But but you can't even really do that.

1697
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:42,220
I just I'm just not sure who the hell this is for.

1698
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:44,980
Yeah, they say that you can do it with

1699
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:49,620
as a connection, as slow as five megabits per second.

1700
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:54,580
But they recommend 15, which I think for most hotel Wi-Fi,

1701
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:58,700
you probably could get get around that like that would probably be fine.

1702
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,780
But once again, you know, you have to have your PlayStation

1703
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:04,580
powered up and stuff, and it's not going to be still.

1704
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:08,100
As good as like playing on the actual thing,

1705
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,700
I just don't see the point of like carrying this with me.

1706
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,460
It would be such a cumbersome thing.

1707
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:15,540
I would think for your money, you may be spending a little bit more

1708
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:18,420
to get something like that, but probably a steam deck.

1709
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:21,100
Honestly, a steam deck, I think, could probably run

1710
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:25,100
the PlayStation streaming stuff if they still have that for PC.

1711
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,100
I thought that that was still a thing they used to have a little while ago.

1712
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:32,140
But if you can still do that via PC,

1713
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:35,020
then why would I buy this dedicated thing that can only this?

1714
01:31:35,020 --> 01:31:40,300
And then once you stop playing, your PlayStation five is just garbage.

1715
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,780
It's e-waste at that point.

1716
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:43,980
You can't use it for anything.

1717
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,460
So no, no, thanks.

1718
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:50,300
All right. So so Shane is in chat right now with a well, actually,

1719
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:54,940
who is saying for me, my PlayStation five is downstairs.

1720
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:56,700
I like to play in bed upstairs.

1721
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,700
This negates having to lug it back and forth.

1722
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:00,540
But that screen worries me.

1723
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:05,220
I just like I get it for you specifically, but I still feel like it's

1724
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:08,980
there's not enough people with those types of use cases

1725
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:13,460
to justify this thing being a success unless the expectations

1726
01:32:13,460 --> 01:32:17,180
are really low for this thing, which maybe they are. I don't know.

1727
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,580
I, I feel like and maybe I'm wrong,

1728
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:25,620
but Sony's time would have been better spent making a portable PlayStation four

1729
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:31,100
that actually can carry your digital PlayStation four library with you

1730
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:34,940
or something where like the disk, if it's your PS4, you can like

1731
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,500
have a temporary version of it on your device.

1732
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:41,380
You can take it with you, so to speak, like a way to do that.

1733
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:44,820
Like, I still feel like that would be far more interesting than.

1734
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:47,740
And the reason why I say PS4 is because I realize

1735
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:51,500
the portable tech is probably too expensive to do a PlayStation five.

1736
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:53,220
But let's take it back to the last gen.

1737
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:56,460
Yeah. And there are even like a lot of PS4 games

1738
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,540
and a lot of stuff to play on it.

1739
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:02,300
I just are just a souped up PlayStation TV again.

1740
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,580
Like, you know, that was Vita tech at one point.

1741
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,700
And you could do streaming that way.

1742
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:08,700
Like, just do something like that.

1743
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:10,260
That's far less expensive.

1744
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,220
Like, it doesn't even have to have a portable screen.

1745
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:13,780
You just have it hooked up to a TV.

1746
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,140
I just think it's.

1747
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,060
I just don't see the point of this, like

1748
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:21,660
considering that everybody like, do you not have a cell phone?

1749
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:22,980
I mean, like a lot of people have cell phones.

1750
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:26,740
I think it would be a lot easier just to get a cell phone device

1751
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:33,260
and buy a controller or I'm pretty sure they even sell one already for this.

1752
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:34,620
Like buy their controller.

1753
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:38,660
That's probably sub $100 and just strap it to your cell phone

1754
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:41,580
because at the very least, you know, that's a controller.

1755
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:45,220
It would be even better if that controller could work separately,

1756
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:49,460
as well as like a DualSense controller with the PlayStation

1757
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:52,540
and just have that type of thing.

1758
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:54,900
Or you could even like, you know,

1759
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:57,380
I don't know what other solutions they have with that.

1760
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,220
But this seems like ridiculous looking for one.

1761
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,860
And it's not the first time that someone's put out something like this

1762
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:05,140
to try to capitalize on streaming there.

1763
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,700
There's other devices, I think, from like Razer or Nvidia

1764
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:12,180
or something like that, that were only streaming cloud streaming devices.

1765
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:13,940
But they worked with multiple platforms.

1766
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,940
Like this worked for like, say,

1767
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:18,660
for PlayStation five streaming.

1768
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:24,820
It also worked for xCloud and whatever else, you know, like Nvidia's thing.

1769
01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:27,060
You know, that might be more worth it.

1770
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:31,620
But if it's just PlayStation five, it's $200.

1771
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,660
That's ridiculous.

1772
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,980
Well, even though Shane gave us a case where he would use it,

1773
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:38,820
he does say in chat over Twitch TV slash Vogue Network.

1774
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:40,500
Nope, it wouldn't be a success.

1775
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,820
And the form factor is ugly as all get out.

1776
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:46,820
And I'm used to OLED on my mobile devices now, so that's a decent downgrade.

1777
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:50,180
Well, I mean, it's a it's a decent form factor,

1778
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:53,620
like if you were to put your own tablet in there or something like that.

1779
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:56,860
Once again, they have I they literally sell this.

1780
01:34:57,180 --> 01:35:03,940
That is a device that you can hook up to your phone or tablet, I think even.

1781
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:05,820
And it works exactly like this.

1782
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:07,660
And you can just stream that way.

1783
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,300
I mean, because I think even like streaming through mobile

1784
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:15,620
or using like your mobile phone to do the cloud streaming with PlayStation,

1785
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:17,300
you can use any controller with that.

1786
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,700
I don't think you're limited to just Sony controllers.

1787
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,020
At least that's not the way it is with.

1788
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,340
I think some of the other streaming services, so it would.

1789
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:28,300
Cool, cool that they're making this, who's this for?

1790
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:31,860
I don't know, like, did they really test their markets with this?

1791
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:34,300
I mean, it just doesn't seem like it makes sense.

1792
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:36,540
Hopefully they end up in a bargain bin soon.

1793
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:42,460
All right. Well, let's let's travel back to a simpler time in our next segment

1794
01:35:42,460 --> 01:35:48,220
where maybe you don't have these devices that are portable,

1795
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,980
but they're not actually portable at all.

1796
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,780
I have no idea how else to a tangent into this segment.

1797
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:54,340
So we're just going to roll the bumper.

1798
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:08,780
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time where I'll dive

1799
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:12,220
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1800
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:15,340
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1801
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:20,900
And Dark Sakura, what did you pick for us tonight for the classic game of the week?

1802
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:24,540
I picked a game that when it was first announced,

1803
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:28,540
I super, super, super wanted to play the full version of it.

1804
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:32,740
And they had one at California Extreme two weeks ago.

1805
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:36,500
So I'm finally doing F355 Challenge.

1806
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:42,220
It is a racing simulation arcade game

1807
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:48,460
that's based off of the car and the official Ferrari challenge.

1808
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:53,700
It was developed by AM2 of Sega for the Sega Naomi multiboard

1809
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:58,180
arcade system board, and it was directed by Yu Suzuki

1810
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:02,500
and was later ported over to the Dreamcast and PlayStation two.

1811
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:09,380
The Dreamcast one was called F355 Challenge

1812
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:15,180
Passione Rossa and PlayStation two was Ferrari F355 Challenge

1813
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:19,060
for the American and European markets.

1814
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:25,740
The only model of a car in the game is a Ferrari F355,

1815
01:37:25,980 --> 01:37:28,100
which is, of course, from the challenge itself.

1816
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:35,580
And it was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 at that time.

1817
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:41,140
Some of the arcade cabinets, there's some different builds of them.

1818
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:45,420
The one that I was most interested in was the three screen model,

1819
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:49,980
which now, you know, you'd hardly see a home sim racing rig

1820
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:53,060
that doesn't have a three screen dance had a three screen.

1821
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:59,300
But it also has an eight

1822
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:06,340
shaped gear shift and three foot pedals, and it's

1823
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:09,780
I've played it now, of course,

1824
01:38:09,780 --> 01:38:13,300
but it basically is as close to its time

1825
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,940
in arcade simulation of being in a Ferrari as you could get.

1826
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:20,540
It was composed of four Naomi units,

1827
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,380
one for each of the screens and one to sync them.

1828
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:29,140
The game does have automatic transition and pedal shift gears.

1829
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:33,980
Another notable thing about it is that it uses the magic weather system

1830
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:37,100
that was similar to what eventually came out in Shinmu as well.

1831
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:41,500
And for the Dreamcast version, it has link cable play

1832
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:44,020
that you can so you can play directly with other people.

1833
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:51,940
But as of 2006, the online servers for F355 challenge are offline.

1834
01:38:51,940 --> 01:38:52,940
In fact, the website's gone.

1835
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:55,820
Soundtrack is pretty, pretty good.

1836
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,980
It was supposed to sound like sort of 80s, you know, heavy metal,

1837
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:03,940
but it was put in the way like a radio station would be kind of outrun like,

1838
01:39:03,940 --> 01:39:09,700
you know, and the music was done by Genki Hitomi and Minoru Nihara.

1839
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:16,100
And it even had it's a radio announcer that was played by Alan Jay,

1840
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:20,860
who is an American DJ who works for Bay FM

1841
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:24,940
in Chiba in Japan.

1842
01:39:26,740 --> 01:39:31,860
So there were different circuits in there for the arcade version.

1843
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:35,860
You had the Motegi Oval Circuit,

1844
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:42,780
which is a motorsport venue in Motegi, Tochigi Prefecture.

1845
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,180
It was originally called Twin Ring Motegi.

1846
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:49,700
And then you have the two Suzuka tracks.

1847
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:51,700
And yes, it's that Suzuka.

1848
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:59,020
It is the short configuration and the full configuration.

1849
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:06,460
There is the Monza, which is actually north of Milan in Italy.

1850
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,180
And this is the 1998 configuration.

1851
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:14,860
There is a Sugo as in Sportsland Sugo,

1852
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:18,940
which is a motorsports facility in Murata, Shibata district.

1853
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:24,540
There's also the Grand Prix of Long Beach.

1854
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,580
It's an IndyCar series race,

1855
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:30,580
but they use the track for that, the Long Beach track.

1856
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:36,300
The home console versions also had five extra unlockable circuits.

1857
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:40,220
There was the Atlanta Motor Speedway,

1858
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:45,260
as in the Hampton, Georgia version.

1859
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:49,660
There's Nurburgring,

1860
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:52,420
which, of course, you can't have a racing game without Nurburgring.

1861
01:40:53,420 --> 01:41:00,420
Laguna Seca, which is one in central California around Monterey, I believe.

1862
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:05,860
There's Seppang, which is a Malaysian track.

1863
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:11,380
And then there's Fiorano, which the special thing about Fiorano

1864
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:14,140
is that it is the private

1865
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:18,060
racetrack that's owned by Ferrari for development and testing.

1866
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:25,500
So, yeah, you can unlock those by either finishing in certain positions

1867
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,500
in a certain race or championship

1868
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:32,060
or driving over a certain cumulative distance in the race

1869
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,660
or by entering a password.

1870
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:39,780
The tracks are also included in F355 Challenge 2

1871
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:43,660
International Course Edition arcade machine that came out in 2001.

1872
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:47,540
This game was announced at E3 2000.

1873
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:54,700
The reception was kind of mixed.

1874
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:02,700
So, Pasha and Rosa, which was the Dreamcast one, got really favorable reviews,

1875
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:06,220
but the PlayStation 2 one got average reviews.

1876
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:12,580
Basically, we're saying that it's pretty eye candy

1877
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:17,860
and very, very dedicated to Ferrari fans.

1878
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:24,380
For the console version, Famitsu gave it 29 out of 40

1879
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:27,980
for the Dreamcast and 27 out of 40 for PlayStation.

1880
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:30,980
The arcade version

1881
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:37,900
in Japan, Game Machine listed it in their January 1st 2000 issue

1882
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:41,900
as the seventh most successful dedicated arcade game of the past year.

1883
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:47,020
And the arcade version also won the award for Coin Op of the Year

1884
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,820
at EDGE Awards 2000.

1885
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:54,460
And Pasha and Rosa was the runner up in GameSpot's best driving game.

1886
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:58,420
The first one, by the way, the winner was Test Drive Le Mans.

1887
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:02,940
And at the fourth annual Interactive Achievement Awards,

1888
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:07,100
the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences

1889
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:12,060
nominated F355 Challenge for the console racing award,

1890
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:14,700
although SSX won it that year.

1891
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:21,260
But overall, the the arcade version just got all kinds of accolades.

1892
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:22,820
And for the home version,

1893
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:28,060
the Dreamcast fared much better than the PlayStation 2.

1894
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:32,180
Of course, if you think about it, Dreamcast is a home now, me.

1895
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:36,340
So, yeah. And that's it.

1896
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:40,100
All right. Oh, that's the Suzuka track right there.

1897
01:43:40,220 --> 01:43:43,060
Yeah, this is you know what this game kind of reminds me of?

1898
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:45,940
Number one, I love the billboards for Pocari Sweat.

1899
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,980
That is definitely something I love.

1900
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:50,220
Dan's gotten addicted to that, by the way.

1901
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:56,140
But also, I love this really reminds me of like a modern day poll.

1902
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:58,780
Well, I say modern day, even though it's 2001.

1903
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:02,940
But like poll position, you know, like, I don't know what it is,

1904
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:05,020
but it just gives me those big poll position vibes,

1905
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,100
maybe because it's simplistic.

1906
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:10,100
And that's not a bad thing, because, you know, when you're driving fast cars,

1907
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:13,100
you oftentimes, you know, want to drive them.

1908
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:14,900
You know, I don't know.

1909
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,300
It's just it kind of gives you a poll position vibes a little bit.

1910
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:19,100
Yeah, no, for sure.

1911
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,020
Oh, and one other thing that I should mention, the music in the game,

1912
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:24,500
some of it found its way into Shenmue.

1913
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,260
Oh, that's fun.

1914
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,620
I mean, they're both AM2 games.

1915
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,660
So I guess it makes sense.

1916
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,980
All right. Awesome. Awesome.

1917
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:36,380
All right. Well, we have a few more things for you guys.

1918
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:38,660
We're going to invite your phone calls here in a little while as well

1919
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:42,140
on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1920
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:46,300
But first, some rapid fire quick headlines, and we'll start with Loki.

1921
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:50,300
I think you're muted, Loki.

1922
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:54,500
I think you maybe know if I hit the button and it didn't quite engage.

1923
01:44:54,540 --> 01:44:57,220
OK, so this is kind of cool.

1924
01:44:57,220 --> 01:45:03,740
So the Xbox Series X is going to be getting some brand new wraps.

1925
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:06,860
And so these are kind of like skins for consoles,

1926
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:11,580
but they're magnetic and kind of fold around it and are held in place by a magnet.

1927
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:14,700
So, of course, some of the first wraps that we're going to be getting

1928
01:45:14,700 --> 01:45:18,220
for the Xbox Series X are based around Starfield.

1929
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:23,100
And so they have a Starfield version, which is $49.99.

1930
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:28,300
They also have a blue and white wrap that I think it was a camo.

1931
01:45:28,580 --> 01:45:33,420
And that is for $44.99, a bit on the expensive side,

1932
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:35,220
but they are pretty cool looking.

1933
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:39,020
And yeah, I have to see what other things they come out with.

1934
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:43,500
But yeah, for sure, I want to get one for my console if it wasn't in a box.

1935
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:52,500
The wraps are supposed to be coming out on October 18th, at least the Starfield one is.

1936
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:56,420
And then the other wraps will launch November 10th.

1937
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:59,980
So and they're made out of vinyl.

1938
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:03,020
This is kind of neat.

1939
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:08,260
So, you know, everyone loves Half-Life 2 and Nvidia announced that there's going

1940
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:14,900
to be a Half-Life 2 RTX version, which is in early development right now.

1941
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:20,060
But it's using their RTX remix platform to basically

1942
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:26,940
mod in higher definition models and ray tracing and all that stuff.

1943
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,860
That's what they do with Portal not that long ago, right?

1944
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:30,420
Right. Yeah.

1945
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:33,900
So it makes sense that they're going to do the same with another source engine game.

1946
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:39,540
So that is going to be coming at some point soon, I think.

1947
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:40,740
Well, early development.

1948
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:42,740
OK, maybe not so soon.

1949
01:46:42,740 --> 01:46:45,540
Eventually will be coming out some day.

1950
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:50,500
Sooner, sooner than the, you know, the ray tracing update for Minecraft.

1951
01:46:50,540 --> 01:46:52,500
Sooner than Elder Scrolls six.

1952
01:46:54,220 --> 01:46:55,140
Much, yes.

1953
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:57,220
Dark Saga.

1954
01:46:57,220 --> 01:47:05,900
Well, there are warnings coming with the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Volume One.

1955
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:13,140
And it's a warning that we see on like older, you know, Looney Tunes cartoons and the like.

1956
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,900
I'll go ahead and read what it says.

1957
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:20,020
This game contains expressions and themes which may be considered outdated.

1958
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:24,660
However, these elements have been included without alteration to preserve the historical

1959
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:27,740
context in which the game was made and the creator's original vision.

1960
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:30,020
Player discretion is advised.

1961
01:47:30,220 --> 01:47:33,580
Of course, they said the same thing with Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection.

1962
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:37,940
So, I mean, I think it's just a cover your ass kind of thing.

1963
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:42,340
I didn't know that there were going to be boobs in this game.

1964
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,580
I didn't know they were talking about war.

1965
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:47,980
How dare you push smoking.

1966
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:53,180
Yeah, and I don't remember those games that thoroughly, so I don't know what, quote unquote,

1967
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:57,140
you know, problematic things might have shown up in the game that don't.

1968
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:00,260
Walking in on Meryl in her underwear.

1969
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,900
Maybe or just things that don't look good in 2023.

1970
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:05,460
You know, society's changed.

1971
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:07,260
So it is what it is. Yeah.

1972
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:13,820
I mean, a similar warning that should be on old episodes of the show, quite frankly, you know,

1973
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:18,900
it's that the humor 20 years ago is different than the humor now, and, you know, it's what it is.

1974
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:21,580
So. Yep.

1975
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:28,660
All right. One other, you know, this classic hasn't changed at all is Excite Bike 64.

1976
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:33,780
That's right. Excite Bike 64 is on its way to Nintendo Switch online on August 30th.

1977
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:39,860
So later this week, this is it's nice to hear about games getting added to Nintendo Switch online again.

1978
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:42,380
I guess opening up these new platforms really did do something.

1979
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:48,900
But yeah, Excite Bike 64 is on its way out and that will be fun for those that remember that game fondly.

1980
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:51,220
Sorry, Loki. No word about Excite Truck.

1981
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:52,900
I guess it's all right.

1982
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:54,700
They're not the Wii games yet.

1983
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:57,180
Once they start doing Wii games, they'll be one of the first ones.

1984
01:48:57,180 --> 01:49:01,060
I'm pretty sure because it's surely, you know, it's got to be.

1985
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:03,660
And then they'll be glorious times again.

1986
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:07,780
Except they'll do Excite Bots trick racing instead.

1987
01:49:08,460 --> 01:49:12,540
And everyone will be like, Oh, that's not what I meant.

1988
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:14,940
I mean, not like this.

1989
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,300
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

1990
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:21,500
and some things that are coming out sooner than Wii games on Nintendo Switch.

1991
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:22,980

2001
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:07,220
That is quite the collection of words and numbers there.

2002
01:50:07,740 --> 01:50:12,300
That's on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

2003
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:17,380
The big con on PlayStation four and PlayStation five.

Bomb Rush Cyber Funk on PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

2011
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,500
Yeah, that looks awesome.

2012
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:06,660
Mega Man X Divine Offline on PC, iOS and Android.

2013
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:10,260
Rhapsody, Moral Kingdom Chronicles.

2014
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:12,340
That's going to be for Europe, actually.

2015
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:14,580
So I'm not going to we're not going to talk about that one right now.

2016
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:16,180
That's coming out earlier in the week.

2017
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:17,460
And that's it.

2018
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:22,300
All right, well, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases over there.

2019
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,940
We have a little bit going on this week.

2020
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:29,540
So on the Nintendo Switch on August 30th, Samba de Amigo Party Central is also out in Japan this week.

2021
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:35,980
We also have The Legend of the Legend of Heroes, Zero no Kisuke Kai and Ao no Kisuke Kai.

2022
01:51:36,460 --> 01:51:39,380
I believe these are older games that are being remastered.

2023
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:44,540
I think they're about 10 years old now, but they're being remastered with full voice acting and being released for the Switch.

2024
01:51:44,540 --> 01:51:46,020
So that's pretty cool.

2025
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:51,940
We also have on the 31st, Taito Milestones 2, another kind of retro game collection.

2026
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:57,780
And I was looking at what games were in this and they have like Kiki Kai Kai, Dino Rex.

2027
01:51:57,780 --> 01:52:01,900
There's some but they also have like The Legend of Kage, the New Zealand story.

2028
01:52:01,900 --> 01:52:06,060
So there's some other, you know, a kind of New Zealand story is so cute.

2029
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:09,740
Yeah. So this is a very interesting this is a deep dive collection, but it looks pretty cool.

2030
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:11,700
So that is out on the Nintendo Switch this week.

2031
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:15,860
And then that is apparently also a US release.

2032
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:18,380
I didn't catch that, but I'm noticing that is out too.

2033
01:52:18,380 --> 01:52:19,700
So maybe I'll pick that up.

2034
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:23,660
I don't know. And then Moving Out 2 is also out on the Switch.

2035
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:24,940
Those are just Switch releases.

2036
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:27,900
Let's check out the PlayStation 5 on the PlayStation 5.

2037

2039
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:43,420
And those are your Japanese releases.

2040
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:45,980
Let's get over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

2041
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:57,180
So on the 29th of August on Xbox, we have Smurfs Kart for Xbox and PlayStation Under the Waves.

01:52:57,540 --> 01:53:00,300

2044
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:19,380

2045
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:22,540

2046
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:26,780
Also, Starfield Constellation Edition.

2047
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,500
And that's going to be it for the week.

2048
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:33,060
Also, that's my wedding anniversary of 18 years.

2049
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,780
Aw, congrats.

2050
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:37,300
Thanks. I haven't killed him yet.

2051
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:39,700
There's still time. I'm just kidding.

2052
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:41,860
No, he's I love my boy.

2053
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:50,740
Well, there's still time for that, but we are out of time with Dark Sakura tonight, as I believe you have one more night of early obligations tomorrow.

2054
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:54,940
So but you'll be back with us full time when we return in two weeks.

2055
01:53:54,980 --> 01:54:01,580
So I'll float around in chat for a little bit, but I got to do a lot of winding down before before bedtime.

2056
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:05,380
So let me see if I can get my thing to do the hearts.

2057
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:06,860
Come on, get up your hand.

2058
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:10,100
There we go. Hearts.

2059
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:13,260
Well, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2060
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:16,540
I hate getting up any time before 12.

2061
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:18,940
OK, maybe 10.

2062
01:54:18,940 --> 01:54:21,900
All right, we'll see you in two weeks.

2063
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:27,020
Oh, don't forget, I'm going to be all day Sunday.

2064
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:29,740
All right, come play with me.

2065
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:31,260
Check it out. Keep me coming.

2066
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:33,540
I can't. I'm busy.

2067
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:36,620
You can keep it open on your phone.

2068
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,780
All right. Bye, everybody.

2069
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:41,700
Take care. Have fun storming the castle.

2070
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:44,620
That's basically what Dragon Con is.

2071
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:47,220
It's storming the castle, except the castle is five hotels.

2072
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:49,620
It's what it is. All right.

2073
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:50,940
Hi. All right.

2074
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:52,540
Let's go back to Loki.

2075
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:55,180
Loki, you have some headlines for us.

2076
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,500
Yeah. So about the GTA six leaker

2077
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:04,500
who apparently hacks Broxer with just an Amazon fire stick in a hotel room, they say.

2078
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:07,940
So there is some apparently the

2079
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:11,540
BBC report had some details

2080
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:15,180
regarding court documents that are filed in U.K.

2081
01:55:15,180 --> 01:55:17,780
talking about 18 year old Arianne

2082
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:22,380
Kurtage, who said was was caught red handed

2083
01:55:23,100 --> 01:55:25,460
when police searched his hotel room.

2084
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:29,780
And he's being held on bail because, you know, he was arrested

2085
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:32,340
for hacking Nvidia as well.

2086
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:36,740
He'd claimed to have downloaded all of GTA six's data

2087
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:39,420
and that he was going to release the source code less.

2088
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:42,740
Rockstar Games messaged him on telegram

2089
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:46,060
and I assume paid him money as well.

2090
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:52,340
But yeah, apparently he was part of a hacker group as well called lapses.

2091
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:57,140
And I'm not sure how he used the Amazon fire stick

2092
01:55:57,140 --> 01:56:00,140
necessarily to hack somebody, but

2093
01:56:00,140 --> 01:56:03,980
somebody, but well, they probably don't want other people to do it,

2094
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:06,500
so they're probably keeping it a little bit vague.

2095
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:07,740
Right. Yeah, exactly.

2096
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:11,500
It could be a key logger or something like that or who knows? I don't know.

2097
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,260
But you never know.

2098
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:15,500
Chat says, wow, that's a lot of laws being broken.

2099
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:17,980
It sure is. It sure is.

2100
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:20,860
Well, you know, if you're breaking the law, break in the story in the news,

2101
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:23,220
the laws. Yeah. Yeah.

2102
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:25,460
It's especially like interesting, like you're a hacksmith.

2103
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,260
You're like, oh, yeah.

2104
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:29,780
And and I'm going to get you the payment to not leak your stuff.

2105
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:32,860
Yeah, that's that's worked out great for everybody that's done that.

2106
01:56:32,860 --> 01:56:37,060
Like, nobody has ever not gotten away from that like that.

2107
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:41,020
Just like 100 percent of the time you're going to get caught

2108
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:43,660
because you're just basically saying, Hey, it was me. I did it.

2109
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:45,620
Hey, it's me. You know, like.

2110
01:56:46,540 --> 01:56:46,980
I did.

2111
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:50,340
Rama Esten chat points out you can sideload a terminal app into a fire stick.

2112
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:52,420
Yeah, I mean, it can be done.

2113
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:55,140
It's just it's yeah, it's just a little surprising, I guess, maybe.

2114
01:56:56,420 --> 01:56:59,180
Yeah. So, well, it's been caught.

2115
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:01,700
Rockstar is going to get, you know,

2116
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:05,340
I didn't realize it was the same person that did this and the Nvidia one,

2117
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:08,500
because, you know, that one, it was a while ago, but it's still,

2118
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:11,740
you know, pretty much everything in that ended up being announced,

2119
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:13,700
except for the tactics.

2120
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:15,700
Redo is still something that was in that.

2121
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,420
I think there might be one or two others.

2122
01:57:17,420 --> 01:57:19,980
And some may be coming. Yeah, it could be.

2123
01:57:21,380 --> 01:57:23,980
What else? I think you have one other thing for us, right?

2124
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:28,500
Yeah. So Bioware is going to be cutting around 50 jobs.

2125
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:32,660
They're saying to help the studio become more agile and more focused.

2126
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:36,180
They said after much consideration and careful playing,

2127
01:57:36,180 --> 01:57:39,660
we have built a long term vision that will preserve the health of the studio

2128
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:43,460
and better enable us to do what we do best, create exceptional story

2129
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,700
driven single player experiences, blah, blah, blah.

2130
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:50,380
And basically saying, you know, commit that the

2131
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:53,460
they're committing to supporting the affected staff.

2132
01:57:53,460 --> 01:57:57,180
We've chosen to act now in part to provide our impacted colleagues

2133
01:57:57,180 --> 01:58:00,180
with the many opportunities as possible.

2134
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:03,620
I don't know if it's necessarily like I don't know where they cut jobs

2135
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:06,300
necessarily with that.

2136
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,500
Maybe it's just

2137
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:12,020
that lay off money or people for

2138
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:15,900
projects or overlapping types of things that they're doing.

2139
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:18,100
There were some reorganization stuff.

2140
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:21,300
So that sucks when people are impacted by that stuff. But.

2141
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:26,260
Yeah, it's I mean, I know they were offering

2142
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:29,620
to relocate people within EA, and I guess, you know, that's, you know,

2143
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:32,220
I guess the least they could do in that type of situation.

2144
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:37,020
But I see. OK, so they were several EA sever ties with a studio

2145
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:39,380
that was working on Dragon Age Dread Wolf.

2146
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:42,220
So I'm guessing it's from that studio then.

2147
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,900
Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

2148
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:48,940
Shane in chat says no faith in Bioware writing after DA for

2149
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:51,300
since I assume that the writing is finished by now.

2150
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:55,500
They let go some really senior writers that went all the way back to Baldur's Gate

2151
01:58:55,700 --> 01:58:57,780
and original Dragon Age of Mass Effect.

2152
01:58:57,980 --> 01:59:02,780
I'm actually curious who they did let go because I really didn't know.

2153
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:07,460
And my initial thought, based on what they're saying in the commitment

2154
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:10,300
and all that stuff, was that they talked a lot about single player.

2155
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:15,420
And I was wondering, did they take multiplayer out of the games coming up?

2156
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,460
But it's weird because I thought multiplayer was such a bread and butter for EA

2157
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:20,940
like that was really.

2158
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:23,460
But then also now you have Baldur's Gate three

2159
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:27,100
has really changed like the whole speaking on.

2160
01:59:27,100 --> 01:59:29,660
You know what? This is what a fully featured game should look like.

2161
01:59:29,660 --> 01:59:31,820
Although I would say that game is too new.

2162
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:35,420
Like this layoff has been in process well before Baldur's Gate

2163
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:38,460
three impacted the equation, but it still is interesting.

2164
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:42,420
But maybe they're they're trying to like back away from multiplayer

2165
01:59:42,420 --> 01:59:44,100
after the whole anthem thing.

2166
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:45,420
So that was my original thought.

2167
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:48,500
But now we're hearing that it's right because Quest Buster in chat says

2168
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:51,580
one of the senior writers, Mary Kirby, was let go.

2169
01:59:51,580 --> 01:59:55,700
She was responsible for characters like Barrick from Dragon Age two.

2170
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:58,020
Kirby was with Bioware since 2006.

2171
01:59:58,260 --> 02:00:00,820
So they're letting writers go?

2172
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:03,780
We got chat, JPT, chat, JPT, we'll just write all the lines.

2173
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:06,140
It'll be fine. Don't fucking start.

2174
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:10,500
We've trained chat, JPT on all of her previous works or wherever,

2175
02:00:10,740 --> 02:00:14,100
all their works, and I'm sure it'll be it'll do a bang up job

2176
02:00:14,100 --> 02:00:16,980
getting that dialogue correct.

2177
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:19,260
Sorry, I'm going to barf on air.

2178
02:00:20,100 --> 02:00:22,020
Um, disgusting.

2179
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:24,700
Yeah, I just.

2180
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:30,580
I is it one of those things where like the new Mass Effect is all already

2181
02:00:30,580 --> 02:00:33,660
written as well, and this studio is like, well, we're going to not be

2182
02:00:33,660 --> 02:00:37,020
able to get that game out for another seven years, so we've pretty much

2183
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:38,700
got our like 10 year plan now.

2184
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:41,340
So, you know, I don't it's it's wild.

2185
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:45,740
Shane and chat says you won't recognize the names probably, but some people

2186
02:00:45,740 --> 02:00:48,180
that wrote some really fantastic characters.

2187
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:51,580
The original Canaan writer is gone now, but he was written by another

2188
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:52,780
person for Mass Effect three.

2189
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:54,580
Wow. That's some.

2190
02:00:55,740 --> 02:00:56,740
Why the right.

2191
02:00:56,740 --> 02:01:01,220
I mean, I God, what you said made me like physically ill, but I

2192
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:04,100
I worry in a boardroom type set up.

2193
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:07,540
There's people that might actually think that

2194
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:11,620
because it's what you see happening with the strike right now, right?

2195
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:14,460
Like there's they want to replace.

2196
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:18,340
Yeah, they want to replace I background actors and writers.

2197
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:19,980
Good for them standing their ground.

2198
02:01:19,980 --> 02:01:21,180
Fuck. Fuck all.

2199
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:24,660
I mean, you can try good.

2200
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:26,500
You'll see how that ends up.

2201
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:29,740
It's not it's nowhere near ready to do that.

2202
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:34,260
But you can certainly think that it can and fail. But.

2203
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:36,460
I don't know.

2204
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:39,340
Shane says the new Mass Effect is like helmed by the writer

2205
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:41,460
of Guardians of the Galaxy, so I already have little faith.

2206
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,300
The movie or the game?

2207
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:45,020
Because the game was actually it was good.

2208
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:47,700
The game was actually pretty good. So.

2209
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:51,460
Yeah, Questmaster says,

2210
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:55,300
also worried about the writing quality and Dread Wolf now, if it is locked down,

2211
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:57,460
they might have let them go for new projects.

2212
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:59,660
But who knows what that means going forward?

2213
02:01:59,660 --> 02:02:01,980
Who will be writing for any future titles after D.A.

2214
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:05,100
for or a new Mass Effect or like DLC?

2215
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:09,700
You know, unless that's all locked and loaded, too. I don't know. So.

2216
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:14,140
Anyway, it's it's very sad to hear about.

2217
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:18,420
And now that I understand it's writers, that's that's a huge concern.

2218
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:22,420
I was walking into this thinking, well, we didn't really know who it was yet.

2219
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:24,540
Maybe the multiplayer or maybe, you know, again,

2220
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:29,380
now I'm really worried that I'm hearing that. That's.

2221
02:02:30,460 --> 02:02:33,980
And it's weird to think that Baldur's Gate was a Bioware game.

2222
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:36,740
Remember that Baldur's Gate was a Bioware game.

2223
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:40,580
I don't know.

2224
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,500
I don't know the new.

2225
02:02:44,500 --> 02:02:46,300
Hey, you know, I'm still rooting for him.

2226
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,940
I want the new Dragon Age to be good.

2227
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:50,900
I want the new Mass Effect to be good. But if they're not.

2228
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:55,900
Moving on to the next story.

2229
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:59,140
Exactly. We just have to.

2230
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:03,420
Hey, Loki, I don't know if you're thinking about the next game

2231
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:05,420
you'll work on after Pixel Poops, too.

2232
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:08,300
I mean, I think you're too busy making videos to think about a new game.

2233
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:12,140
But if if you ever were to make a new game, something to think about

2234
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,820
is a new deal from the Epic Game Store.

2235
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:18,100
100 percent of net revenue

2236
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:22,700
if you give them six months exclusive to your game.

2237
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:26,340
It's a new program that the Epic Store is running called the Epic

2238
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:28,100
First Run program.

2239
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,300
It is for games and apps.

2240
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:33,420
And if you make them exclusive to Epic, you'll get, like I said,

2241
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:37,180
100 percent of net revenue after that window ends.

2242
02:03:37,180 --> 02:03:40,580
You're going down to 88 percent of revenue because you might remember

2243
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:43,740
Epic kind of tried to mix that up a little while ago

2244
02:03:43,980 --> 02:03:46,260
where the standard is usually about 30 percent.

2245
02:03:46,460 --> 02:03:48,540
And Epic took that down to 12 percent.

2246
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:51,460
So now they're trying to entice you with 100 percent.

2247
02:03:53,340 --> 02:03:57,740
The net revenue means you don't get things like taxes, refunds.

2248
02:03:57,780 --> 02:04:00,260
Epic does cover payment processing and all that stuff, though.

2249
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:04,740
They're saying that if you participate in this program,

2250
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:07,060
you can get your stuff in front of more eyes.

2251
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:10,820
The games and app get exclusive badging and spots on the home page.

2252
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:14,340
So, yeah, this is going to be open to developers and publishers

2253
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:18,340
who are releasing products on or after October 16th.

2254
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:21,700
It is eligible if it has not appeared on another PC store

2255
02:04:21,860 --> 02:04:25,260
or subscription service on those storefronts.

2256
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:29,660
If you already have an exclusive deal with Epic, you're not eligible for this.

2257
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,020
So this is a new program.

2258
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:34,020
Otherwise, it's interesting.

2259
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:37,460
But can I can I say something very real and honest about the epic store?

2260
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:41,380
I think they need to work on making that store interesting

2261
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:44,180
because it's it's not a very interesting storefront.

2262
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:47,580
It's a very boring storefront, quite honestly.

2263
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:52,100
And the only reason I usually sign into Epic Games is either one,

2264
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:55,260
they got an exclusive dammit or two.

2265
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:57,300
They're giving away free games.

2266
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:59,460
And I want to go claim those free games.

2267
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:02,140
That's it. And even now, the free games are starting to repeat again.

2268
02:05:02,180 --> 02:05:03,020
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

2269
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:03,860
I've already got more off.

2270
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:05,260
There's rumors are going away, too.

2271
02:05:05,260 --> 02:05:10,460
So I but I just think the store itself is kind of ugly, to be quite honest.

2272
02:05:10,460 --> 02:05:13,660
And I think the product that Epic's putting out there is not

2273
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:15,780
quite as robust as steam.

2274
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:18,100
I mean. Don't get me wrong.

2275
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:20,580
I think steam is kind of rested on it for a little while.

2276
02:05:20,740 --> 02:05:23,380
But I've noticed like just in the past year, year and a half,

2277
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:26,420
especially with the more recent redesign, they tried to.

2278
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:29,060
I kind of figured that was all tied to the steam deck.

2279
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:32,100
But whatever the reason, I feel like steam at least looks a little.

2280
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:37,460
Neater these days, but I just I find the epic store so fucking boring to be.

2281
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:39,700
Yeah. I mean, if they get rid of the free games,

2282
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:43,060
I mean, no one's going to log into that thing unless they're getting

2283
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:44,340
an exclusive game.

2284
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:47,180
And even then, you're just they're paying for that exclusivity.

2285
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:51,540
It's like people default to steam because it's just the place

2286
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:53,780
that where everything is, like I have a huge library there.

2287
02:05:53,780 --> 02:05:58,300
And honestly, I have a pretty decent library in epic, but I buy most of that.

2288
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:03,740
Yeah. And yeah, I'm fine with not logging into it.

2289
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:08,900
Loki, if you were to ever release a new game with this temp to.

2290
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:11,420
A 100 percent deal.

2291
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:13,500
Whatever. I mean, it's not going to hurt anything, I don't think.

2292
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:16,980
I don't I wouldn't sell much anyways.

2293
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:19,820
I know. I was going to say, are you saying 100 percent of zero is still zero?

2294
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:23,020
Yes, I mean, kind of, you know.

2295
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:26,260
By the way, go buy Pixel Poops two on steam.

2296
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:27,460
It is available.

2297
02:06:27,460 --> 02:06:29,380
And the original Pixel Poops is free.

2298
02:06:29,380 --> 02:06:32,940
But you can check out some of the rad DLC via the ever hard working.

2299
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:37,860
Why? Why are we always always like to plug our hard working friend, Aaron?

2300
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:40,380
So. All right.

2301
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:43,100
But that was the now dark to see us as to be fair.

2302
02:06:43,100 --> 02:06:44,340
I bought Pixel Poops, too.

2303
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:45,780
I think it was on itch.io.

2304
02:06:45,780 --> 02:06:49,340
And actually, technically, I think Loki gets a slightly bigger cut

2305
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:52,500
when you do that. So that's it doesn't matter at this point.

2306
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:55,380
Like I'm almost like willing to tell Aaron just like.

2307
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:59,100
Just keep the money and it like doesn't really matter.

2308
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:01,980
Like we sell so few copies of it ever.

2309
02:07:01,980 --> 02:07:04,180
Like it just doesn't even matter anymore.

2310
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:05,780
Going to make it free at some point.

2311
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:07,820
I don't know when, but like not yet.

2312
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:10,340
I want to get the physical version out at some point.

2313
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:11,460
I think that would be really cool.

2314
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:14,340
But that's a lot of work for like not a lot of return.

2315
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:15,700
I have so rare.

2316
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:17,100
I have something very rare.

2317
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:19,100
I know. I know you have one of them.

2318
02:07:19,100 --> 02:07:21,220
Like one of the twelve that have been out there.

2319
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:23,420
I never did get Jamie's is still sitting here.

2320
02:07:23,420 --> 02:07:27,980
So it gave one to one YouTuber guy,

2321
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:29,900
but I gave one to him.

2322
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,580
He never played it.

2323
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:33,940
At least I didn't see a video on it.

2324
02:07:33,940 --> 02:07:35,940
So it's cool.

2325
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:37,700
But you got there.

2326
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:38,820
I did get a magazine.

2327
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:41,540
Still have a whole bunch of them in, you know, sealed.

2328
02:07:41,540 --> 02:07:44,460
That's still I've got like five, six copies of that magazine.

2329
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:46,380
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

2330
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:48,460
All right. Well, this is the part of the show

2331
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:50,260
where we're going to open it up for any questions.

2332
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,940
Also in a museum.

2333
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:55,900
Member in the game museum or whatever, that's wild.

2334
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:59,660
I'm going to open it up to your calls

2335
02:07:59,660 --> 02:08:02,140
if you want to give us a call over at Vogue Network dot com.

2336
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:04,220
That's VOG Network dot com slash discord.

2337
02:08:04,460 --> 02:08:07,620
You can join our green room and we'll take a call or two from there

2338
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:09,740
if anybody is so inclined.

2339
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:12,700
Also, I would invite you to join our discord to chat with us throughout the week.

2340
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:14,980
Oftentimes we chat with our listeners

2341
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:17,900
throughout the week about certain news that's happening.

2342
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:21,260
In fact, many listeners brought to my attention this week

2343
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:23,380
that Bob Barker passed away this week.

2344
02:08:24,620 --> 02:08:27,420
As you many of you know, at this point at the age of ninety nine,

2345
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:31,660
which is is sad, but it's also one of those things where it's like

2346
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,460
you live to be ninety nine.

2347
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:34,500
That's a really good life.

2348
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,900
And where you get to that point where it's like, OK, this is

2349
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:39,180
this is we're celebrating and let's look back on that.

2350
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:42,740
So, you know, we talk about things that aren't just video games as well.

2351
02:08:42,740 --> 02:08:47,220
So check that out over on our discord server over at Vogue Network

2352
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:49,380
dot com slash discord.

2353
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:51,060
I'll also open it up to any.

2354
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:57,820
Comments and questions in chat that you have for us over at Vogue Network on Twitch.

2355
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:02,900
And then also I would read emails participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

2356
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:07,300
But I just looked in the inbox and unfortunately is empty.

2357
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:09,500
That's sad.

2358
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:13,300
Participate at Orange Laundry dot com if you want to change it up for a future week.

2359
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:15,380
We are also available on socials.

2360
02:09:15,380 --> 02:09:18,020
We are on Twitter because I'm not calling it the other thing

2361
02:09:18,620 --> 02:09:21,900
at not just VOG Network, but we're on Twitter at OLR.

2362
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:26,780
If you want to follow Vogue Network on Blue Sky, you can at Vogue Network dot com.

2363
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:29,540
And because you can actually have a domain name there on Blue Sky.

2364
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:30,420
So check that out.

2365
02:09:30,420 --> 02:09:33,620
We are also expanding our presence on other socials as well,

2366
02:09:34,340 --> 02:09:36,660
including TikTok I mentioned earlier.

2367
02:09:36,660 --> 02:09:42,700
We're also YouTube is a big push for us lately over at a YouTube Vogue Network.

2368
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:44,340
So just look up VOG Network.

2369
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:46,460
You're probably going to find us in all the socials.

2370
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:50,020
Yeah, in chat, as we mentioned, I saw this plenty of times as well.

2371
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:54,660
Tiger Claw mentions that Arlene Sorkin, the original voice of Harley Quinn,

2372
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:58,900
also passed away, who I believed also played an inspirational character

2373
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:03,500
for Harley Quinn, the animated version, anyway, in Days of Our Lives,

2374
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:05,300
where she kind of was originally started.

2375
02:10:05,300 --> 02:10:09,740
So I know the animated world really, you know, especially

2376
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:13,580
with some of the other recent losses in the voice acting world.

2377
02:10:13,580 --> 02:10:15,660
It's very, very unfortunate.

2378
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:20,700
SSG100Matt says, Rob, so what are you most looking forward

2379
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:23,140
to doing at Dragon Con aside from your panels?

2380
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:26,900
Well, we answered that in a video, which is available on our YouTube

2381
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:29,660
over at Vogue Network, but I'll give it a serious answer.

2382
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:35,620
I'm looking forward to this going to be Alan's first Dragon Con,

2383
02:10:35,860 --> 02:10:38,340
so I'm hoping it's going to be a little bit like Disneyland,

2384
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:40,140
where you still have some of the magic

2385
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:42,580
seeing it through somebody's eyes for the first time.

2386
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:45,540
I think that'll be a lot of fun and you need to take him around to do things.

2387
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:49,780
I like getting to see people is always good

2388
02:10:49,780 --> 02:10:51,900
and one of the most important parts.

2389
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:54,780
And for those that have watched the TikTok

2390
02:10:54,780 --> 02:10:57,340
that we did in the quick two minutes we had on there,

2391
02:10:57,900 --> 02:11:00,700
you'll notice that's something we mentioned.

2392
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:03,900
Shane in chat says, Rob is most looking forward

2393
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:06,220
to the days of constant COVID testing afterward.

2394
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:08,180
I know it's a risk I'm taking.

2395
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:11,980
Now, I do plan to wear a mask at Dragon Con

2396
02:11:11,980 --> 02:11:14,740
when like not in my hotel room or speaking on a panel.

2397
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:17,700
To try to lessen the chances of that.

2398
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,540
But I know it's a risk I'm taking.

2399
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:24,740
But there comes a point where you weigh the risk of that

2400
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:29,260
and the risk of not taking these opportunities

2401
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:33,900
that are literally once in a lifetime in some places and like getting on them.

2402
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:34,980
So I'm doing everything I need to do.

2403
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:38,260
I'm not going to be seeing anybody after I get back.

2404
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:40,940
And yeah, I'll test. It's fine.

2405
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:45,540
So I'm measuring everything with it.

2406
02:11:46,180 --> 02:11:46,940
That's all.

2407
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:49,660
Phil of nine in chat says,

2408
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:52,300
just don't let anyone with hot breath get in your face.

2409
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:53,900
I don't plan to.

2410
02:11:53,900 --> 02:11:59,580
So in Dragon Con 2021, the year I wore a mask, I was fine.

2411
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:03,580
It was last year I didn't wear a mask because nobody did.

2412
02:12:03,580 --> 02:12:06,740
And I also had had COVID three months earlier.

2413
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:08,700
And I was like, oh, I can't get it again that quick.

2414
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:10,460
And I was wrong.

2415
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:13,100
So change it up a little bit this year.

2416
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:20,900
So pod culture in chat says got to meet Alan at some point.

2417
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:22,100
Well, he's going to be there.

2418
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:24,220
So you know where to find me.

2419
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:26,020
I'm sure we'll run into you at some point.

2420
02:12:26,020 --> 02:12:31,060
But also the well, I can't guarantee Alan will be at all my panels.

2421
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:32,620
But you know what is funny?

2422
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:35,220
So Alan downloaded the app.

2423
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:38,780
I would say this is the panel to try to attend, if any of them.

2424
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:44,740
And because Alan actually brought up the app and he was like, yeah,

2425
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:46,220
I was kind of looking at the programming.

2426
02:12:46,220 --> 02:12:49,460
He was like, I actually was going through the panels and I was like,

2427
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:51,180
oh, this one sounds interesting.

2428
02:12:51,420 --> 02:12:55,420
And when I marked it, I realized it was the panel you and Bobby are doing.

2429
02:12:56,420 --> 02:13:00,620
And it was it was the it's a panel called How Do You Do Fellow Kids

2430
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:03,300
Thriving on Streaming Media After the Age of 40.

2431
02:13:03,540 --> 02:13:05,780
And so Alan saw that and was like, oh, that speaks to me.

2432
02:13:05,780 --> 02:13:07,460
And he actually bookmarked it.

2433
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:11,700
But that that's funny to me, because that actually makes me go, oh,

2434
02:13:12,220 --> 02:13:14,580
maybe it's working for other people too.

2435
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:17,700
Then if Alan like didn't remember that that was the thing we had proposed

2436
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:22,020
and he actually found it on his own and wanted to do it, maybe.

2437
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:27,900
Rama in chat says, Rob, is there a possibility of a surprise stream

2438
02:13:27,900 --> 02:13:31,620
of y'all in the hotel room with a bottle of fireball on Discord?

2439
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:35,860
So when you involve alcohol, things get a little dicey

2440
02:13:35,860 --> 02:13:38,580
with some of the terms of service.

2441
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:41,660
Like, I know you can do it on Twitch as long as that isn't

2442
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:43,500
the focal point of your stream.

2443
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:47,820
I'm not 100 percent sure what the rules are on TikTok, but either way,

2444
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:51,100
we're not planning on any streams.

2445
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:54,820
And I don't think you should, you know, put a lot of stock in that.

2446
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:58,380
But might we do some more short videos

2447
02:13:58,700 --> 02:14:01,300
and things now that we're kind of dipping the toes into that?

2448
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:03,380
I think that's something we'll be doing.

2449
02:14:03,380 --> 02:14:07,380
So keep an eye out on the socials for all of that, for sure.

2450
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:11,500
And we'll absolutely do a wrap up show when we're back

2451
02:14:11,500 --> 02:14:15,900
and talk about some of that as we continue to expand our YouTube presence, for sure.

2452
02:14:16,420 --> 02:14:20,300
So Shane in chat says, stupid Pokemon Go.

2453
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:22,420
Twitter is teasing my gay peacock.

2454
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:25,100
That's Quaxley's final evolution.

2455
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:26,380
I forget the name.

2456
02:14:26,380 --> 02:14:27,540
They know how to get me.

2457
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:29,900
So I did Pokemon Go this weekend.

2458
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:32,260
I actually I got 15,000 steps yesterday.

2459
02:14:32,780 --> 02:14:34,780
But here's I didn't pay I didn't pay for the event.

2460
02:14:36,380 --> 02:14:39,940
I don't want to get too into it because I just didn't want to make a scene

2461
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:43,180
of it in this week's show, but like I'm really, really mad

2462
02:14:43,180 --> 02:14:45,420
at something that happened in Ingress, like really mad.

2463
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:49,740
So I'm canceling my sub and I don't really plan to play Ingress

2464
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:52,180
outside of some things that I've committed to for my team.

2465
02:14:53,900 --> 02:14:57,580
Pretty much past those things that are a couple of months out, that's it.

2466
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:59,780
I'm pretty much done with Ingress at this point,

2467
02:14:59,780 --> 02:15:02,380
unless there are some serious things that change.

2468
02:15:02,540 --> 02:15:06,140
And so it's actually kind of made me not want to play anything Niantic,

2469
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:09,060
but I'm kind of having to weigh that whole.

2470
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:14,900
Recognizing my issues and recognizing

2471
02:15:16,060 --> 02:15:20,580
maybe I still need some gamification for my own health.

2472
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:24,500
And so I allowed myself to the compromise, quote unquote,

2473
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:27,580
I made is that I'll play play Pokemon and Pikmin,

2474
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:29,420
but I'm not giving them any more money.

2475
02:15:29,420 --> 02:15:32,980
So I didn't buy the ticket.

2476
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:38,180
And to be honest, you know, it wasn't anything.

2477
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:44,220
Like it wasn't anything special that they were offering.

2478
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:47,980
It was a fifteen dollar ticket for some more shinies.

2479
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:50,940
Bobby, can I read that on air?

2480
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:54,740
It was a fifteen dollar ticket for some shinies and like

2481
02:15:55,900 --> 02:15:59,180
some unknowns of which there's only one I was missing.

2482
02:15:59,180 --> 02:16:03,540
The M and one of my friends caught the M for me.

2483
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:08,060
OK, so I was going to let Bobby say why he was gone tonight,

2484
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:11,420
because it's his business, but he just appeared again in chat

2485
02:16:11,420 --> 02:16:15,460
and gave us permission to tell you all that he was in the E.R.

2486
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:18,900
and his show was canceled by a three millimeter kidney stone,

2487
02:16:19,180 --> 02:16:20,660
which should pass tomorrow.

2488
02:16:20,660 --> 02:16:24,900
So and I'm sure Loki can tell you kidney stones fucking suck.

2489
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:26,900
So sorry to hear that they do.

2490
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:28,340
Sorry to hear that that happened to you, Bobby.

2491
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:31,260
But on the other hand, with that kind of pain,

2492
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:35,660
I'm actually really happy to hear when you say should pass tomorrow.

2493
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:38,740
I'm like super happy to hear it's like super treatable.

2494
02:16:38,940 --> 02:16:41,220
And we're not talking about like a surgery or something,

2495
02:16:41,220 --> 02:16:44,140
because there was a part of me and I'm sure you were thinking it, too,

2496
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:48,500
that was like, oh, no, is his Dragon Con going to get like,

2497
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:50,580
because I know this is a big deal for Bobby, too.

2498
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:51,380
It's like that.

2499
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:54,460
This is like the one week a year you get to be immature as fuck,

2500
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:56,460
but also mature when doing panels.

2501
02:16:56,460 --> 02:16:59,140
But then, you know, doing the, you know, drinking a board game place.

2502
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:00,300
I was a little worried for those.

2503
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:03,940
Oh, that's so I was hoping I was actually hoping like, OK,

2504
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:09,660
kidney stone sound waves passing it done by Wednesday, Thursday.

2505
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:10,220
And we're good.

2506
02:17:10,220 --> 02:17:11,780
So it sounds like that is the case.

2507
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:13,580
I'm very happy to hear it,

2508
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:15,660
although I'm not happy to hear it happened.

2509
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:19,820
I'm just happy to hear it's got a resolution that'll be quick. So.

2510
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:25,100
Ah, as Joe and Matt says, I got three shinies the whole weekend.

2511
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:26,420
Didn't pay either.

2512
02:17:26,420 --> 02:17:28,900
My expectations were low, but the rates of this event were trash.

2513
02:17:29,100 --> 02:17:32,300
Shane was telling me that you only had the boosted rates if you paid.

2514
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:34,340
I got two shinies.

2515
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:36,660
I got one of the little Pikachu's with a crown.

2516
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:38,860
I don't remember which color. I think yellow, maybe red.

2517
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:41,140
I got one of the Pikachu's with a crown that shiny

2518
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:43,780
and I got a lowland Diglett randomly.

2519
02:17:44,740 --> 02:17:46,940
That's it. I only got the two because I didn't play today.

2520
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:49,260
Really, it was it was a little too hot by the time I woke up.

2521
02:17:49,380 --> 02:17:52,180
So that's all.

2522
02:17:52,180 --> 02:17:54,100
All right. Well, that's it.

2523
02:17:54,140 --> 02:17:56,500
That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2524
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:57,900
Before we wrap it up here,

2525
02:17:57,900 --> 02:18:00,820
I will go around and get my final thoughts and do good night.

2526
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:05,140
But let me thank you all for taking the time out to listen to Orange Launch Radio.

2527
02:18:05,340 --> 02:18:06,740
Thank you for listening live.

2528
02:18:06,740 --> 02:18:11,180
If you were here at the Voice Geeks Network or if you were listening

2529
02:18:11,180 --> 02:18:14,700
on our podcast feed, whether it be on Spotify, iTunes, wherever

2530
02:18:14,700 --> 02:18:15,820
did you find podcasts?

2531
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:18,740
Thank you so much for downloading the show and check checking it out.

2532
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:20,180
Tell a friend or two about the show.

2533
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:22,780
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2534
02:18:22,900 --> 02:18:25,660
But we need more voices to put out here on air.

2535
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:29,140
Don't forget to follow follow Vogue Network on all of your favorite socials,

2536
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:31,860
including TikTok and YouTube, as well as here on Twitch.

2537
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:33,820
We really appreciate that as well.

2538
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:37,940
And yeah, as a reminder, we'll be back in two weeks.

2539
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:41,420
I really, really look forward to hoping to see some of you at Dragon Con.

2540
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:44,900
And again, as I was mentioning a moment ago, probably the best panel

2541
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:48,540
to catch would be the streaming over 40 panel.

2542
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:50,900
It's going to be a small room.

2543
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:53,260
Bobby, myself and Alan will all be there.

2544
02:18:53,260 --> 02:18:57,420
So if you're wanting to meet folks that that would be I mean, I'm in the app

2545
02:18:57,420 --> 02:18:59,260
and you can see other panels I'm doing as well.

2546
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:02,380
And plus, actually, I have extra ones that are on socials.

2547
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:04,940
But I, I would say this.

2548
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:09,620
The roast panel that I'm doing is not going to be good

2549
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:12,420
if you don't know the people as well.

2550
02:19:12,740 --> 02:19:14,620
Like that sounds bad.

2551
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:17,340
It's going to be funny, but it's I feel like a lot of jokes might

2552
02:19:18,180 --> 02:19:21,180
like it's it's definitely for like the digital media people

2553
02:19:21,340 --> 02:19:22,860
and people that actively participate in that.

2554
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:26,980
So I'm just saying, like, if you want to meet me, that's not the panel to do it.

2555
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:31,460
You could still I don't I'll still say hi, but I would urge you

2556
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:32,620
to pick one of the other panels.

2557
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:36,060
And probably the streaming over 40 is probably your best bet, to be honest.

2558
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:38,500
So and thank you, Questbuster. I appreciate it.

2559
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:40,060
I will have fun at Dragon Con.

2560
02:19:40,060 --> 02:19:43,020
Loki, I hope you have fun next weekend, too, with the video production,

2561
02:19:43,020 --> 02:19:45,380
all the other stuff that you're up to reviving your Twitch presence

2562
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,740
or whatever you do.

2563
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:49,140
Do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

2564
02:19:50,580 --> 02:19:53,740
Yeah, just look out for my my new episode.

2565
02:19:53,740 --> 02:19:55,060
Hopefully it'll be coming next week.

2566
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:57,460
It's a lot. Like I said, it's it's going to be longer.

2567
02:19:57,460 --> 02:20:00,900
It's it's movie esque is very cinematic.

2568
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:03,180
So looking forward to having that done.

2569
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:04,260
Look forward to seeing it.

2570
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:06,820
And congrats. Congrats once again on your journey this week.

2571
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:11,740
And even if it isn't a ton of exposure, you still got some exposure

2572
02:20:11,740 --> 02:20:13,780
and some exposure is better than nothing.

2573
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:15,780
Hey, we just got a follow earlier from somebody

2574
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:17,140
I think that was in your.

2575
02:20:17,140 --> 02:20:19,380
So that was my teammate Binnish.

2576
02:20:19,380 --> 02:20:22,500
Hey, I'm happy, which I want to say Binnish character team.

2577
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:26,420
OK, Binnish had the highest ranking out of all of all four of us.

2578
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:29,380
They are a huge fan of MCC.

2579
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:31,060
They watch it with their dad, which is great.

2580
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:36,180
And they're one of our new members of of our Channel 64 family this season.

2581
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:40,100
So they they were the ones I mean, honestly owe a lot to them

2582
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:42,300
because they were the ones that put the video together.

2583
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:44,300
The application video that got in.

2584
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:46,380
They're the ones that motivated us.

2585
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:49,100
That was a great that was a great promo, by the way.

2586
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:50,500
So props to exactly that.

2587
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:53,580
We got to love those obscure, you know, Atari Jaguar commercials.

2588
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:57,540
So, yeah, lots of thanks to them, for sure.

2589
02:20:57,860 --> 02:20:59,300
OK, awesome.

2590
02:20:59,580 --> 02:21:02,780
Well, I'm going to keep my final thought tonight very simple.

2591
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:05,660
I am going to take my cues from the late great Bob Barker and say,

2592
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:07,940
please don't forget to have your pets spayed or neutered.

2593
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:11,260
Have a wonderful night, everybody. Bye.
