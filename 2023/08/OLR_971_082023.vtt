00:00.000 --> 00:14.640
Twitch is now going to block banned users from watching your stream, finally!

00:14.640 --> 00:19.200
It won't block them from watching clips, nor bots, nor signing out and watching your

00:19.200 --> 00:23.400
stream again, but it did take developers time to implement and begin rolling out to check

00:23.400 --> 00:27.140
off a box despite the immensely trivial workarounds.

00:27.140 --> 00:29.340
This is the I forgot my microphone intro.

00:29.340 --> 00:32.860
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

00:32.860 --> 00:36.140
this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

00:36.140 --> 00:38.820
every gamer has a voice.

00:38.820 --> 00:42.580
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

00:42.580 --> 00:47.240
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:47.240 --> 00:54.460
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 971 of our

00:54.460 --> 00:58.660
show for tonight, August the 20th of 2023.

00:58.660 --> 01:03.020
My name is Rob Roberts and you just heard here at the top of the show there our voice

01:03.020 --> 01:07.560
over guy Jason and yes, if his audio sounds a little different tonight, you want to talk

01:07.560 --> 01:08.940
about dedication.

01:08.940 --> 01:12.220
He's traveling right now, didn't have his normal microphone.

01:12.220 --> 01:18.040
He did that with a laptop microphone from his car to get that audio intro in locked

01:18.040 --> 01:24.960
in about 20 minutes ago tonight here as we tape live at the voice keys network vog network.com.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.000
Speaking of dedication joining myself, Rob Roberts here every week is the one and only

01:29.000 --> 01:33.880
dark Sakura or Jamie Summers dedication.

01:33.880 --> 01:43.080
I mean, I dedicate this show to my bed where I collapsed into after a very long day yesterday.

01:43.080 --> 01:47.120
Yeah, you were you were at California extreme this weekend, huh?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.640
Yeah, sure was.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.560
Yeah, I was able to make it again.

01:50.560 --> 01:58.280
But it was something very busy and I'm glad honestly enough for everyone who talks shit

01:58.280 --> 01:59.280
about crocs.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.080
They are damn comfy for for a long convention.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.680
Maybe, maybe I need to get some for Dragon Con coming up.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.200
Who knows?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.480
So did you have a good time?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Did you have a good time over?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.640
I know we'll get into some of the games you played and stuff.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.440
But did you have a good time overall at California extreme?

02:13.480 --> 02:14.880
Oh, I totally did.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.280
I totally, totally did.

02:16.320 --> 02:23.040
And I came home with a cute little Pikachu that if you're following me on the socials,

02:23.560 --> 02:24.440
you might have seen it.

02:24.640 --> 02:25.080
I did.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.360
I saw a cute little picture.

02:26.360 --> 02:26.840
What was it?

02:26.840 --> 02:29.920
Was it like a it was like a World Championship Pikachu or something?

02:30.120 --> 02:30.480
It's cute.

02:30.520 --> 02:34.360
No, he's riding a train wearing a little conductor outfit.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.400
Oh, okay.

02:35.400 --> 02:35.640
Okay.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.480
I thought it might have been from one of the recent cities or something, but that's cool.

02:38.520 --> 02:38.880
Cute.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.240
I don't I don't know.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.320
But he was cute.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.600
And the guy gave me five bucks off.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.320
All right.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
Hurray for a deal.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.000
Love it.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.160
All right.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.360
So we're gonna come back and talk more about California stream a little later.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.880
But I also want to introduce the one and only tech master Loki.

02:55.360 --> 02:55.880
Hello.

02:55.920 --> 02:56.640
Hi, Loki.

02:56.640 --> 02:57.440
How are you?

02:57.840 --> 02:58.440
I'm good.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.800
You've had you've had a little bit of a week, haven't you?

03:00.800 --> 03:02.880
Yeah, it doesn't even seem like it's been this week.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.400
So it's like, yeah, it's just, that seems like it's so distant in the past.

03:07.400 --> 03:12.400
Let me let me ask this first off, because I know we're going to talk a little bit about Minecraft, a lot of it about Minecraft here in a minute.

03:12.400 --> 03:17.520
But you've got like another content creator playing there behind you in Minecraft.

03:17.520 --> 03:18.760
What is this all about this video?

03:18.880 --> 03:27.880
Because again, we do tape live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.720
And when you tune in live, you can see things like visuals.

03:31.200 --> 03:41.880
And Loki's got I'm commenting on this visual because it definitely we're going to talk Minecraft, but I'm curious who this particular content creator is and what its relation is to what we're going to talk about.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.840
So that's major.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.280
Not only do does he participate in MCC, but he also runs it.

03:52.560 --> 04:03.640
So this is his his VOD from the last they call it Canon MCC where the actual players that are invited to MCC on a regular basis play.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.200
So it's MCC 33.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.480
And they believe they were the aqua axolotls.

04:08.480 --> 04:17.880
That's probably probably wrong now that I think of it, but it was the one the first episode where Etho was in there and stuff.

04:17.880 --> 04:23.960
It said it's supposed to be recommended watching for me because it gives me an idea of how all the games are played.

04:24.360 --> 04:38.400
But this is let's talk about the relevance of that real quick here and talking about this whole Minecraft championships, because let's see, I seem to remember a couple of weeks ago on the show, you came on here and you said, Oh, yeah, you know, really, you know, you've had this group that you've been working

04:38.400 --> 04:43.400
with for a while, this channel 64 and your Minecraft creation, which you really got into in the last couple of years.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.760
And everybody, I would hope at this point knows about your YouTube channel.

04:46.760 --> 05:01.160
But if for some reason they don't Loki or on YouTube, you've got these awesome Minecraft videos, these big builds, these mega man inspired gigantic builds that one day minecraft.net will finally recognize one of these two

05:02.160 --> 05:03.840
that ship has sailed there.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.280
They've already moved on to like with SpongeBob or something.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.160
No, that's turtles.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.480
Ninja Turtles is a new one.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.800
Yeah, we love Ninja Turtles.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.360
At least Tiger Claw loves Ninja Turtles.

05:12.360 --> 05:18.840
Anyway, so a couple weeks on the show, you said, Oh, yeah, my team were applying to this Minecraft championship thing is like a really big deal.

05:18.920 --> 05:23.360
But like all these people apply and like there's there's no chance in hell that we're going to get in.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.800
We're not going to get into this.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.880
We're doing it for the experience, the fun and all this stuff.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.280
Loki, do you have any news you'd like to share with us this week?

05:29.600 --> 05:33.360
So apparently there was a chance in hell that we would get into it, and we did.

05:33.400 --> 05:40.360
We are one of 10 teams that will be competing next Saturday in MCC rising to.

05:40.640 --> 05:46.600
So MCC, that stands for Minecraft Creator Championship.

05:46.960 --> 05:57.440
And basically it is it's like I guess it's sort of like the Olympics or like Super Bowl of Minecraft in like minigames and stuff.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.040
So they have a bunch of different games, everything from like parkour to

06:04.520 --> 06:05.640
there's like a game.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.640
It's like Mario Kart almost.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.720
It's called Ace Race.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.240
It's pretty fun.

06:11.040 --> 06:16.680
PVP stuff, survival stuff, there's puzzles, there's a lot of teamwork things.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.400
So it's like Mario Party in Minecraft for a ton of people.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.280
Sort of, kind of.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.720
Yeah, it's but it's basically there's like

06:26.200 --> 06:28.040
I think it's like eight different games.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.520
So the games are going to get announced later this week

06:31.600 --> 06:32.840
because they just hint at it.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.560
You know what you're going to be playing and then.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.760
Then, yeah, Saturday, it's going to be at least like four hours,

06:41.960 --> 06:46.480
four to five hours of streaming as we, you know, play.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.560
So we're the orange ocelots.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.480
I like the fact that we got orange.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.320
And that was right.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.280
You didn't ask for colors.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.240
Well, they tried to assign everybody

06:55.240 --> 06:58.800
the color of the team that they applied with.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.640
So we were the Crimson cast members.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.880
And so there was already another red team.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.920
They're like, well, orange was the closest thing we had.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.840
So we put you in order to play.

07:06.840 --> 07:07.720
That's fine.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.840
It was meant to be.

07:08.840 --> 07:13.000
We only did Crimson cast members because it rhymed with CNC.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.640
So that was about it.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.600
But yeah, it's been

07:17.600 --> 07:20.600
big, crazy and extremely stressful for sure, because,

07:21.000 --> 07:22.640
you know, they're one of the teams.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.600
I mean, like honestly, like I going into it,

07:25.800 --> 07:28.880
I'm not great at like competitive Minecraft stuff.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.080
I build stuff.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.200
I play around with friends and stuff and I can edit videos

07:33.520 --> 07:36.320
and I'm doing that stuff pretty regular.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.720
There's another team that all they do is grind MCC Island stuff.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.600
So of course, they're going to come in and just dominate everything.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.280
But that's not really what MCC is about, though, too, because in the canon MCC,

07:47.720 --> 07:50.720
you have content creators like there are people from hermitcraft.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.120
There's quite a few of them actually participate in MCC

07:54.400 --> 07:58.480
and they're not like PvP gods or parkour gods at all.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.120
I mean, it's just kind of just participating and having fun with it.

08:02.120 --> 08:06.600
And so I was stressing this myself out way too much about everything,

08:06.600 --> 08:09.120
because, you know, I'm like, oh, man, I'm going to be terrible.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.040
I don't want to get last place.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.920
Like I just this is going to be horrible.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.280
Everyone's expecting us to do well.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.360
This is not going to go well at all.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.640
I mean, it's fine.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.680
There's a little bit there's a little bit of that as well.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.400
But like you got there's 40 content creators in this thing.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.720
At least 20 of them have to be feeling how you feel.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.360
Yeah. And there's it's not it's all varying sizes.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.480
So like our team, you know, we have content creators are all about,

08:32.480 --> 08:36.080
you know, a thousand subs, 1500 subs and under.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.160
There's another team that's kind of like that as well.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.760
There's some that have, you know, 50,000 subs or 100,000 subs.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.680
So it's varying sizes.

08:45.680 --> 08:51.040
And it it was up to us major and not crew folks that put on the event

08:51.040 --> 08:55.800
to decide who they felt were going to be the most entertaining to watch.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.920
And so thankfully, they picked us.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.240
They liked our video, your little intro video.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.480
And it is over on Twitter.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.960
And I saw it on your Twitter over at Loki or it was really funny.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.760
Like, I don't even like I don't follow the Minecraft memes and all that.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.680
But it was it was easy enough for me to follow.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.600
And like, obviously, you made like a really funny age joke about it,

09:12.600 --> 09:14.320
about why you do the content creation.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.720
Like, I'm so old and I'm so lonely and I laughed. It's good.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.840
So and that's that's the thing to do is that like,

09:20.840 --> 09:24.480
if you feel like you're flopping or whatever, just make it funny.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.560
Like that's exactly that's all you have to make it funny.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.920
And it doesn't matter if your last place my last place hilariously.

09:32.200 --> 09:37.000
Well, the thing is, like I know in context, I decided like, OK, well,

09:37.680 --> 09:40.360
you know, I'm like really stressing myself out about it,

09:40.360 --> 09:43.920
like trying to get like really good stuff because I'm not good at parkour.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.480
I tried a race stuff on the practice server.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.600
I'm all right at it.

09:49.600 --> 09:52.920
But like there's a lot of people that are taking it way more seriously than that.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.880
But at the same time, like, well, wait a second.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.160
Like, you know, people that I watch, like on Hermitcraft and stuff,

09:58.160 --> 10:00.200
I'm like, where are they placing on these MCCs?

10:00.200 --> 10:03.280
And lo and behold, they're in the bottom 25 percent as well.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.200
So I'm like, OK, I don't feel as bad anymore.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.880
Like this is this is the the level of skill that

10:09.320 --> 10:12.080
a content creator similar to myself would have.

10:12.080 --> 10:15.520
I'm like, OK, that's like a load off a bit still stressful

10:15.520 --> 10:17.360
because I still want to be entertaining and stuff.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.520
Yeah, and I don't stream nearly enough. But

10:21.160 --> 10:25.000
this week, a lot, you know, I have the whole week off to

10:26.040 --> 10:27.280
well, a lot of things.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.080
So we just started our season three of our Channel 64.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.440
So that was something that we've been doing this weekend.

10:33.880 --> 10:37.920
I'm still editing my finale for season two, which is ridiculously complex.

10:38.520 --> 10:39.960
It's like a it's like a movie.

10:39.960 --> 10:44.520
It's just ridiculous what so that'll come out hopefully this week.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.960
Maybe next week, I'm trying to get it out sooner than later

10:47.960 --> 10:50.280
because, you know, people are going to be having season three videos out

10:50.280 --> 10:53.400
and that's going to be ridiculous. I'm the last one.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.120
And then, of course, MCC rising

10:56.120 --> 10:58.400
training stream. So we're going to be doing a lot of that this week.

10:58.440 --> 11:02.960
We have an interview with one of the MCC channels tomorrow.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.040
So that'll be fun.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.720
We've got fan art.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.280
I was going to say, I've never gotten fan art before.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.400
So so looking at our chat over at twitch.tv, such a VOG network

11:13.000 --> 11:15.600
where we do tape live on Sunday nights.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.120
S2100 Matt is asking, I'm sure your subs and follows have jumped

11:19.120 --> 11:20.240
since this happened.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.000
Not by a lot.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.840
It did appear to well, it did appear to me looking at social media

11:24.840 --> 11:27.920
that, you know, there were a lot of people like I know you'd said

11:27.920 --> 11:30.720
on the show a couple of weeks ago, this is kind of a big deal.

11:30.880 --> 11:34.240
But of course, I don't follow Minecraft that community as closely.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.720
I was kind of like, oh, well, I, you know, a big deal

11:36.720 --> 11:38.400
is kind of a relative thing, right?

11:38.400 --> 11:39.560
It's what's important to you.

11:39.560 --> 11:43.200
But then I was noticing in like the replies to like your application video

11:43.200 --> 11:46.320
that had been posted, there's that like a lot of people seemed to.

11:46.320 --> 11:49.120
Yeah. And then I saw the fan art thing as well and all that.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.960
So I was like, dang, this thing definitely has its fans and people.

11:52.960 --> 11:57.480
People get into it like it's a sports like it's the Olympics, basically.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.560
You know, yeah, there's been like like I was looking at my sub count.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.840
So I've gained like 30 subs since Wednesday, which is that's

12:03.840 --> 12:06.440
pretty good. I take 30 subs for the network.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.080
YouTube to say, you know, I'll take it.

12:09.120 --> 12:13.360
Like, honestly, I'm not I'm not like only 30, you know, whatever. That's fine.

12:13.920 --> 12:18.120
But the whole point was to just get our names out there.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.160
So now there's people that a lot of people like, especially when the

12:21.960 --> 12:24.280
reveals of the teams came out, they're like,

12:25.160 --> 12:26.760
we don't know who these people are.

12:26.760 --> 12:30.680
Yeah, and that's not necessarily us, but like a lot of different creators

12:30.680 --> 12:32.800
are like, I've never heard of these creators before.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.560
I'm going to go check them out.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.640
So that's kind of cool.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.000
I'm still trying to leverage this into getting noticed

12:40.000 --> 12:42.560
by more people from Hermitcraft and others.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.320
So like one of our coaches is this guy goes by named Cubfan,

12:46.640 --> 12:48.240
who is one of the hermits as well.

12:48.240 --> 12:52.480
So I'm going to try to convince the coaches this week.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.280
We'll see how that goes.

12:54.280 --> 12:58.520
But like, yeah, it's just it's fun just to get to meet

12:58.520 --> 13:01.320
some of these people and stuff, and the teams have been really cool.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.400
Yeah, I mean, I hope I hope it works out, because like, I know

13:06.400 --> 13:10.120
a lot of like the people that have been in like MCC rising in the past, like,

13:11.600 --> 13:15.320
you know, their channels do eventually do better later on.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.160
But like, I don't know, I don't think it's going to like,

13:17.160 --> 13:18.920
we're not going to just jump all of a sudden, like,

13:18.920 --> 13:22.040
I'm not going to have like 100,000 subs in a month or something like that.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.840
I think I think the right way you're looking at it

13:23.840 --> 13:27.000
is like the potential collaborations in the future and getting to know

13:27.000 --> 13:30.280
other people and, you know, working on, you know, it's just like

13:30.280 --> 13:32.480
kind of like how you ended up with this group you're with now.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.240
You didn't start with the intent to do that.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.680
You just networked among other smaller content creators

13:36.680 --> 13:38.640
and now found yourself where you are.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.400
And now look at what you've accomplished together in this giant Olympic thing.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.560
So it only goes up from there, right?

13:44.880 --> 13:45.840
Yeah, hopefully. Yeah.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.560
So so yeah, next week, next week, it's going to be Saturday

13:49.840 --> 13:52.600
at 12 Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

13:54.520 --> 13:59.440
Yeah. Come come watch me compete in the MCC championships

13:59.440 --> 14:02.680
and our MCC championships.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.240
It's going to be nuts.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.440
I can't wait.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.640
Here's the hard part, too, about it.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.760
Like, see, it's so on our practice server and stuff like they have

14:09.760 --> 14:13.640
some of the games, but like at least half of the games you can't practice.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.440
You just go into it.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.720
You got to you have to watch some videos, figure out how it's played

14:18.720 --> 14:20.840
and good luck.

14:20.840 --> 14:23.000
So it'll it'll be fun.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.360
All right. Well, good luck to you.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.880
Can't wait to see on Saturday.

14:26.880 --> 14:30.320
We'll be spamming those links all over socials as we root you on

14:30.320 --> 14:32.640
and the orange ocelots.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.680
All right. Well, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight

14:35.680 --> 14:37.320
and then we'll get into our gaming weeks, of course.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.840
But first, let's talk about some of the big news in gaming.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.640
And I guess appropriate for Minecraft, because this was one of the biggest games

14:44.640 --> 14:45.800
that we saw on.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.120
Obviously, this game has evolved a lot, a lot, a lot since then.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.440
But let's talk a little bit about one of its very first platforms,

14:51.440 --> 14:56.240
the Xbox 360 and the big news that came out about that this week.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.840
Look, you want to start us off here.

14:57.840 --> 15:03.080
Yeah. So basically, Microsoft is shutting down the Xbox 360 marketplace,

15:03.080 --> 15:05.560
which makes sense because we're talking like a console

15:05.560 --> 15:07.800
that's two generations old at this point.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.200
But, you know, they are giving you a little bit of a head's notice.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.200
So July 29, 2024 is when that's going to be going down.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.800
At that time, you just won't be able to purchase new games for the Xbox 360.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.800
So if you're looking to get some digital games on the 360,

15:24.200 --> 15:26.720
you got a year to do it.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.640
And then after that, they said this change will not affect your ability

15:29.640 --> 15:33.280
to play Xbox 360 games or DLC you've already purchased.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.240
It's just purchasing new things, which I mean, yeah,

15:37.240 --> 15:39.600
eventually you got to shut down those storefronts.

15:40.280 --> 15:43.440
It's, you know, 18 years old as the console here.

15:43.480 --> 15:47.480
I mean, it's just it's bound to happen at some point.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.720
So it's one of those things where it's like it is the end of an era.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.840
But at the same time, it's like, dang, like, especially when,

15:53.840 --> 15:57.440
you know, it's coming off of the news that like Nintendo shut down the Wii U store

15:57.680 --> 16:01.480
not that long ago, and the Wii U was certainly a newer system

16:01.480 --> 16:04.960
than the Xbox 360 to go for 18 years is a long time.

16:04.960 --> 16:09.360
And what I think is particularly notable about this is especially,

16:09.360 --> 16:11.720
you know, again, in contrast to something like Nintendo

16:11.720 --> 16:16.280
that recently shut a storefront down, is that really this is just about

16:16.280 --> 16:20.040
actually buying things on an actual Xbox 360.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.760
And that's just buying new things.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.000
It has nothing to do with redownloading things you already bought.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.360
You can do that or DLC that you already buy. You can do that.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.240
If you want to buy Xbox 360 games on your Xbox

16:31.240 --> 16:35.640
one or your Xbox Series X, S, et cetera, you can still do that.

16:36.040 --> 16:40.480
Now, of course, not every Xbox 360 game is playable.

16:40.720 --> 16:44.240
They didn't get backwards compatibility for everything or licensing updates

16:44.240 --> 16:45.960
or what have you for everything.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.560
But that's still a really big chunk of games

16:48.560 --> 16:50.920
that isn't going away from all of this.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.680
Again, in contrast to what we've seen other storefronts do,

16:54.680 --> 16:57.640
I'd almost argue that Microsoft is doing this the way

16:57.880 --> 17:01.800
I think we wish other consoles would sunset.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.320
You know, maybe Microsoft has that advantage of that.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.960
They still have this huge infrastructure because they are Windows,

17:08.240 --> 17:10.520
you know, essentially at the end of the day.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.840
You know, so they have the server capacity and all that to do this.

17:14.840 --> 17:19.040
But, you know, now it does affect like if you own movies and things like that.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.520
I believe that's the one kind of interesting thing,

17:21.520 --> 17:25.920
because I remember you could get TV shows on Xbox 360 and play them that way.

17:26.560 --> 17:31.200
I remember Heroes, the TV show, you could get that on Xbox 360.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.040
And I think I own an episode or two because that's how I watched it,

17:35.040 --> 17:36.760
how I watched an episode that I missed.

17:37.080 --> 17:41.080
So I would not be able to watch those anymore on my Xbox 360.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.360
That is something that's going away.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.880
Again, I believe it's licensing, et cetera, et cetera.

17:44.880 --> 17:48.320
But Microsoft is giving you a year's notice

17:48.920 --> 17:52.560
that your digital library will still transfer to other systems

17:53.320 --> 17:56.960
or a mobile device or, you know, other other things like that.

17:56.960 --> 18:00.680
So I do feel like Microsoft is going about this the right way

18:00.680 --> 18:03.280
and is kind of setting the model in some ways.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.160
Is it perfect?

18:05.160 --> 18:09.120
No, but is it about the best we can hope for from a big company like Microsoft?

18:09.160 --> 18:12.080
Yeah, I think so. I think so.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.960
So. Darkstalker, I don't know if you were raising your hand or what.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.880
It's hard to tell with the Vtuber sometimes.

18:17.880 --> 18:21.320
I was doing a shrug emoji.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.160
Yeah, well, you don't it's not something

18:24.160 --> 18:26.280
that really affects you because you weren't a big 360 gamer.

18:28.160 --> 18:31.560
We have one, I don't think I've hooked it up in. Yeah.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.440
I have to think about it a while.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.440
I have one or two Xbox 360.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.240
I say one or two because I'm pretty sure Alan had one when we,

18:40.240 --> 18:41.680
you know, consolidated our lives.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.560
So I think we have two.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.080
But I couldn't tell you the last time we turned that on.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.320
I mean, I do miss things that you can't play backwards compatible,

18:49.320 --> 18:53.400
like DDR Universe is a great example for music game fans,

18:54.120 --> 18:55.840
you know, because DDR

18:55.840 --> 18:58.320
Ultramix already went away with the original Xbox.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.960
So DDR Universe is going to be going away essentially.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.680
But, you know, at the same time, it's like.

19:06.080 --> 19:11.040
It's if you own the disk, you could still play it on an actual 360.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.880
Nobody's taking that away.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.840
So, yeah, it's it's it's just the digital storefront

19:17.200 --> 19:19.000
and some of the movie TV stuff.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.440
So as Joe 100 Matt in chat says, RIP the original TV sports, TV sports.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.120
Yes, all of that.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.000
Bobby Blackwell also confirming I own a couple of specific

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
episodes of TV shows on the Microsoft Store.

19:30.280 --> 19:33.720
I just remember they they used to give away the Guild on their team.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.120
Remember that old Felicia Day short thing, the Guild?

19:36.160 --> 19:37.480
Yeah, that was on there, too.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.960
I don't know if that's considered TV show or if that was like a different thing.

19:40.960 --> 19:44.280
I don't know how they because you used to be web series originally.

19:44.280 --> 19:48.440
Yeah, you used to be able to watch movie trailers on 360 as well, I'm pretty sure.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.520
So I'm not sure if those just all kind of count as TV shows or what.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.680
But at this point, when YouTube isn't,

19:54.960 --> 19:57.960
you know, it's like you can kind of go find what you need to find. Right.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.240
But let's see.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.920
Bobby Blackwell says I have one and it's in my office, but it's not hooked up

20:05.160 --> 20:09.440
because this old TV only has one HDMI port.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.840
So anyway, in one year's time,

20:12.840 --> 20:16.480
we will be saying rest in peace to the Xbox 360 storefront.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.480
But the Xbox 360 as a device lives on.

20:19.760 --> 20:24.280
You can still see an Xbox 360 at California Extreme in 20 years,

20:24.280 --> 20:26.560
and it will still be able to play things like DDR universe.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.480
There wasn't one this year.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.320
Well, it might not be old enough yet,

20:30.320 --> 20:33.400
but at some point it'll be at some point it'll be a museum.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.800
In the end, nothing lasts. Yep.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.520
As Joe and Matt says, I miss afterburner climax.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.760
It got delisted a bit, but it was never made backward compatible past 360.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.000
Probably because the backwards compatibility or because the delisting,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.560
excuse me, I'm sure I'll have to spend 50 dollars for it

20:50.560 --> 20:52.680
as part of a Sega collection Sunday.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.880
Bobby Blackwell also pointing out another great element of this news

20:55.880 --> 21:00.160
is that 360 multiplayer games will still work. Yes. Yeah, that's good.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.240
And again, that's probably. Yeah.

21:02.240 --> 21:06.920
A plus of it being tied into the greater windows

21:06.920 --> 21:09.880
and, you know, everything that Microsoft does with that, because.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.680
You know, when they pulled the plug on the Nintendo storefronts that.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.720
Though you couldn't even play the Nintendo games online anymore,

21:21.720 --> 21:24.080
like the whole Nintendo online service went down.

21:24.080 --> 21:27.440
So I think that's really cool that they're keeping that intact.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.040
Yeah. Bobby says this is literally just them shutting down

21:32.040 --> 21:34.760
the financial aspect and the video DRM aspect.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.440
Pretty much. Pretty much so.

21:36.440 --> 21:39.960
Yeah. And a whole year's notice,

21:39.960 --> 21:43.240
which I want to say is longer than we got with some of the Nintendo news.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.400
I keep picking on Nintendo.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.960
It's not like other platforms haven't done this,

21:45.960 --> 21:49.440
but in the day and age that we live in, we're more and more. What's that?

21:50.040 --> 21:52.360
I thought it's just so easy. Yeah. Yeah.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.120
As more and more platforms go digital,

21:55.120 --> 21:58.440
this is just something we're going to talk about more and more for sure. So.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.760
All right. Like it's like we may as well just accept the inevitable.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.840
Yeah, right. Yeah.

22:05.840 --> 22:09.560
All right. Well, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks, of course,

22:09.560 --> 22:11.960
in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week,

22:11.960 --> 22:15.080
where we talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.760
So Dark Soccer, I'm sure you had a busy weekend.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.320
How was your gaming week?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.760
So I went to California Xtreme yesterday

22:22.960 --> 22:25.480
and we stayed for a while.

22:25.480 --> 22:30.720
It's 60 fucking bucks to park because there was a 49ers game.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.760
Oh, bar. Oh, that's awful.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.080
That's that's right. I forgot that it's in Santa Clara now.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.320
It was ridiculous.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.080
Exploitive, exploitative, whatever they call it. It's just horrible.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.960
Yeah, well, it was we ended up, though.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.600
I mean, Dan parked and I had brought like a

22:47.720 --> 22:51.040
an ice cooler with like snacks for on the way and a couple of drinks.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.640
So I mean, we it wasn't like we spent a whole lot inside the con.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.120
But it was very eventful.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.600
I did Reninda Melody once.

23:02.600 --> 23:06.440
Who has the best T-shirt living my OK-est life.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.440
I ran into Neil.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.600
And that was great.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.960
We hung out for a little bit.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.760
I played a bunch of stuff, like at least I'd say 30

23:17.920 --> 23:20.400
30 different games of various varieties.

23:20.920 --> 23:24.440
So I will start I'm going to go through this quickly,

23:24.440 --> 23:28.600
but there's a few things I want to focus on is so I played.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.840
First of all, I did play some stuff in the console room.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.560
They had a super graphics hooked up, so I played Aldines,

23:34.560 --> 23:37.600
although they had a Daimakai Mura in earlier.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.280
And I wished I'd played that instead because it's like one of the best home

23:40.280 --> 23:45.920
ports and mega race for the Panasonic 3DO, which is garbage.

23:46.640 --> 23:47.760
I love that game.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.840
That was my first like CD-ROM game when I had like an external CD-ROM

23:51.840 --> 23:56.480
for my PC because it would run on like a single speed or dual speed CD-ROM.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.040
You were welcome to keep enjoying that game,

24:00.040 --> 24:04.040
and I will just smile and nod and not know it's a bad game.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.560
I completely agree, but I liked it at the time.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.360
Like I've watched video of it like after the fact, I'm like, wow, that's.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.680
Really bad. I played this.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.720
Really? And I like the one guy, though, he sort of

24:17.120 --> 24:22.680
reminds me of Don Knotts from like Three's Company, like the host. Yeah.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.720
Yeah. All right.

24:24.720 --> 24:28.800
Well, moving on to the not quite categorizable games.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.480
I played Baby Pac-Man, which was great.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.160
I love Baby Pac-Man.

24:33.160 --> 24:36.160
And they had it as a ticket game,

24:36.600 --> 24:40.040
but it's got a pinball element to it called Ticket Tacto.

24:41.240 --> 24:45.360
And you've got like a tic tac toe board that lights up

24:45.360 --> 24:50.720
as you shoot a ball into one of eight holes.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.600
There's a post between each hole.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.960
And they're sort of diamond shaped.

24:55.640 --> 24:59.240
So the the layout of it, they're they're on more of a curve

24:59.240 --> 25:01.760
and you have to shoot up a ramp and land in one of the holes.

25:01.760 --> 25:05.720
And then, you know, when you fill them all, you win however many tickets.

25:05.720 --> 25:07.920
And it's it's it's a ticket muncher game.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.280
But it was enjoyable for, you know, the

25:11.520 --> 25:14.520
the 30 seconds I dedicated to it.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.160
So I'll go over the pinballs next.

25:18.160 --> 25:22.040
So, of course, I played Foo Fighters, which I still love that one.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.800
I played Diner.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.840
I played Sword of Fury,

25:27.160 --> 25:30.360
which is a pretty fun table, if a little frustrating.

25:30.720 --> 25:35.720
I played Legends of Valhalla, which is is it one of those Jersey Jack ones?

25:36.600 --> 25:38.320
It was it was interesting.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.000
Wasn't my favorite.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.280
I did get to play one of my favorites, which is Circus Voltaire.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.800
That is just an amazing table.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.560
And then it was funny.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.200
There's also I didn't play any of them because, of course, I owned them.

25:54.040 --> 25:58.280
But they had a there's were lined up in this order.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.560
They had Black Knight 2000.

26:01.560 --> 26:06.640
They had Theater of Magic and a World Cup soccer.

26:06.920 --> 26:10.200
If you switch out the Theater of Magic in the Black Knight 2000,

26:10.200 --> 26:12.440
that's exactly the same order I have my three in.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.840
You know, so it was just funny to me to see them together.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.440
And then I played the new venom table.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.200
I didn't get to get on a premium.

26:20.560 --> 26:30.320
I thought the venom table was a little bit boring,

26:30.320 --> 26:33.240
but I figured it was for people who don't like all the thrills

26:33.560 --> 26:35.880
and chills of a Circus Voltaire type machine

26:35.880 --> 26:37.360
that we're looking at right now on the other screen.

26:39.320 --> 26:41.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.760
God, I'm still having audio issues this week.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.560
My bad. You cut out for just a minute when you were talking about the venom table.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.440
Go ahead. Oh, well, I thought the venom table,

26:48.600 --> 26:50.760
at least the pro was interesting.

26:51.560 --> 26:54.600
The premium looked a little bit better.

26:54.600 --> 26:58.880
So I didn't get a chance to play it, but I would give it a chance if I saw it.

27:00.600 --> 27:05.120
And they also they did have like the the James Bond tables

27:05.120 --> 27:07.120
that are themed after different movies.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.320
And they had a Godzilla, which we have a Godzilla right now,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.080
where I think we did a temp trade for it.

27:15.080 --> 27:17.680
And now for the the video games.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.800
By the way, one last thing about that venom table

27:20.800 --> 27:23.360
is it reminds me very much of Deadpool

27:24.680 --> 27:27.760
with the little versus fighting modes and the stuff like that.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.080
So if you played the Deadpool table, this is very similar.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.080
So now going to the

27:34.880 --> 27:38.960
the arcade games I played is I played a sit down Star Wars arcade.

27:39.480 --> 27:42.600
I played of course, I had to play Beat Mania three, the final

27:43.440 --> 27:45.720
had a lot of fun. I played Pepper 2.

27:46.720 --> 27:49.840
I didn't play in foot pedal mode, this is me, my feet hurt.

27:50.440 --> 27:54.920
I'm old. They did have some other music games

27:54.920 --> 27:59.400
like a sound vortex and, you know, you beat and those things, DDR.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.960
I played Pepper 2, which I've never been a big fan of,

28:04.960 --> 28:07.560
and I just played it because it was there.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.320
I played Nark. Oh, God.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.560
And there was this guy behind me, like talking like some big know

28:13.600 --> 28:15.920
it all about, you know, this machine, blah, blah, blah.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.240
And I said, yeah, and it was in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.000
What? Yeah, the end when they're or the part

28:21.000 --> 28:23.160
when they're in the warehouse and they're playing it there at the final boss.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.280
Oh, I didn't know that.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.280
I'm like, hell yeah, you didn't know that.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.640
Anyway, I played Professor Pac-Man.

28:33.080 --> 28:36.040
Which is a.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.680
When you're tired and you're not seeing things well,

28:38.680 --> 28:43.080
then doing a find the reverse of this image is a pain in the ass.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.080
Um, of course, I played kicks.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.680
I love kicks. I played Dig Dug. I played Strider.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.760
I played Bostonian Outrun.

28:50.760 --> 28:53.680
It was a stand up Outrun. Super Don Quixote.

28:55.160 --> 28:59.040
Sorry, I've never heard of a professor Pac-Man, and I had to go looking it up.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.000
This is this. Oh, my gosh.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Sorry. Flashing lights warning.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.800
Sorry, I didn't know.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.520
But that's that's fascinating.

29:08.560 --> 29:11.560
And this is another game that I do not know how to pronounce

29:11.600 --> 29:13.360
and never have known how to pronounce.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.520
And it's it wasn't even super that fun to me.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.440
It was like Frogger and Mr.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.120
Driller ish a bit.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.560
But I'm going to mispronounce this.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.640
I'm just going to spell it out. ZZY, ZZYXX.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.400
So Ziziks maybe.

29:28.400 --> 29:33.120
But it's you have these bricks moving back and forth with little gaps.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.840
You have to go up in the gap and move around in the gap

29:34.840 --> 29:36.800
and move around in the gap and move around the gap till you hit the top.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.720
Yeah, I it was all right.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.480
The name was more fun than the game.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.320
I'm going to get past a few of these because I'm going to go back to them,

29:48.320 --> 29:51.000
but I also played Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp.

29:52.080 --> 29:56.080
And I played Xevious and I played Satan's Hollow,

29:56.680 --> 29:59.120
which is oh, yeah, I love Satan's Hollow.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.600
Yeah, shooting game.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.200
And I played a point blank, too.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.000
I love point blank.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.840
Well, it's so funny because Dan and I have been talking about

30:09.720 --> 30:14.400
point blank the other day and how we he wish he hadn't sold

30:14.400 --> 30:17.680
all of our gun cons and everything and I was like, well, you know.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.840
And so there were some oh, yeah.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.240
And the other one I played was an unreleased game called Nightmare in the Dark.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.920
But I mean, it's since been it's a complete game.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.920
And you might you might hear something about that from me eventually.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.360
So there were some indie games there, you know, the same

30:36.360 --> 30:38.840
some of the same folks, I think they did Killer Queen.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.680
There was a game called Death Ball.

30:43.600 --> 30:47.160
A kind of victory where you and another person

30:47.160 --> 30:52.000
had to kick a ball across into the opposite person's color,

30:52.000 --> 30:53.560
and then it injures them.

30:53.560 --> 30:57.000
But you're like if you're on the left and your enemies on the right,

30:57.000 --> 31:00.520
your color is facing you on like a center partition

31:00.800 --> 31:04.200
and their colors facing them on a second partition.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.240
And you have to jump around and do stuff.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.520
I only played it once.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.480
I wasn't good at it and I didn't particularly enjoy it.

31:11.480 --> 31:12.560
But yeah, that's it.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.000
And it's it's I mean, there's some people who really love it.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.600
For me, I was tired.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.560
I was like, I don't want to be competitive.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.480
There was another game called Cosmotrons.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.320
That's another vectory type of game.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.840
In fact, it's very modern vector.

31:28.840 --> 31:33.320
And you you only have to

31:33.560 --> 31:37.240
you have four buttons and one of them rotates your position.

31:37.840 --> 31:43.080
And and then you have like one to keep going up and another to shoot.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.880
And it's trying to get these targets on the screen.

31:45.880 --> 31:48.160
It's very green vector on black background.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.400
It's an interesting little game.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.960
I didn't have enough time to really practice it to get good at it.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.720
And then there was another one called Black Emperor.

31:57.960 --> 32:02.120
And this one's kind of fun for as simple of a concept as it is.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.440
It is a sort of endless runner game, but you're on like a motorbike

32:06.920 --> 32:10.480
and your goal is to, number one, stay on the road

32:10.960 --> 32:13.480
and stay on the center of the road.

32:13.480 --> 32:17.120
Like the center of the screen is the best because you can run into obstacles

32:17.120 --> 32:20.520
or if you go off the screen at all, then you crash.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.080
And it's it's really simple.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.680
You have literally, you know,

32:26.600 --> 32:29.840
sort of a sliding controller to stay up or down.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.800
Another flashy flash game.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.640
Sorry, it's like lots of lots of big flashing.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.240
Sorry for the folks watching on Twitch.

32:37.240 --> 32:41.320
Well, and then you have your accelerator button and, you know, other things.

32:41.320 --> 32:44.120
But the game, it's it's.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.480
Pretty addictive, but

32:48.480 --> 32:51.280
deceptively difficult.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.120
And I mean, and see the whole point,

32:53.120 --> 32:55.920
you know, if you get off that road or if you get off screen

32:55.920 --> 33:00.760
and it is really easy because the the speed of the scrolling alters.

33:01.400 --> 33:07.040
So you're having to constantly adjust to maintain that center area,

33:07.040 --> 33:10.680
and it's really easy to get knocked off the screen or go too far ahead

33:10.680 --> 33:14.160
and run into those barriers like just passed on the screen.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.440
It's Desert Bus, Motorcycle Edition.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.240
No, no, no, no, no.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.000
It's it's more exciting, I think, than Desert Bus.

33:22.120 --> 33:24.520
But yeah. So anyway,

33:25.320 --> 33:28.120
that was that was pretty much everything I played.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.320
You know, there were a bunch of other games.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.680
I had a whole bunch of the sit down tables like

33:32.920 --> 33:37.520
like they were playing Warlords, you know, in one of the rooms.

33:37.520 --> 33:40.200
And I didn't see any of the giant machines, you know,

33:40.200 --> 33:41.840
because they used to have like the giant

33:44.000 --> 33:48.480
the the ticket Tetris, I guess, or the Space Invaders.

33:49.920 --> 33:53.400
And then Dan.

33:53.400 --> 33:58.600
Yeah, Dan was playing Warlords, and there was also a the Ferrari F

33:58.600 --> 34:01.280
whatever game, the full cab.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.120
And and, you know, there were folks, you know,

34:04.120 --> 34:07.640
there was the Garage Band, not Garage Band stage, Rock Band.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.840
Sorry, I've got Garage Band on the brain.

34:09.840 --> 34:13.800
There was the Rock Band stage upstairs, and there was someone.

34:14.760 --> 34:19.840
This this girl had to have been like 12, killing it on Heartbreaker.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.040
I'm like, holy crap.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.880
How do you know this song?

34:24.880 --> 34:27.160
You know, and then. Raised right.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.920
Like I have clothes older than you.

34:31.080 --> 34:34.760
But and I hung out talking with, you know, some of the vendors up there.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.800
People selling stuff out of their collections.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.680
And I picked up a Pio Pio two remix

34:40.680 --> 34:44.440
on Super Famicom to add to my collection of Pio Pio.

34:45.240 --> 34:52.200
And and the guy there gave me a cotton CD that went with the rerelease.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.560
He just had is like, do you like cotton?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.840
I was like, hell, yeah, I like cotton. Here you go.

34:56.840 --> 35:01.240
Thanks. And I mean, there was like one artist

35:01.680 --> 35:04.440
in the small room and we chatted for a little bit.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.760
And I bought I bought some of her merch because her stuff was really cute.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.120
And and she does, I think, VTuber work.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.200
So it was really cool.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.960
And her name was also Jamie.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.040
It's spelled differently than mine.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.040
But yeah, I mean, the whole thing was was pretty nice.

35:21.040 --> 35:25.080
And then there was a movie is like, I think,

35:25.080 --> 35:30.240
the the person that saved pinball and did said it was a really good movie.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.880
And I kind of wish I'd gone to watch it.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.320
But at the same time, you know, it was nice being off on my own

35:35.320 --> 35:38.240
and doing my own thing for a little bit because I wouldn't run into melody

35:38.240 --> 35:43.480
otherwise. Yeah, yeah, that was that was it.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.400
It was a really good time.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.400
I played and of course, for the other stuff I played, I played Dead by Daylight.

35:49.200 --> 35:54.320
I played I played Disney Dreamlight Valley.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.840
And Weird Al.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.760
At home, but speaking of Dead by Daylight,

35:59.760 --> 36:03.200
you're you're on a little bit of a streaming break for a moment, right?

36:03.200 --> 36:04.960
I think I was seeing not on purpose.

36:04.960 --> 36:05.720
Yeah, just because.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.880
Well, yeah, just because the stuff going on in your professional life.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.920
Yeah, I put myself on a vacation because I'm in training

36:11.920 --> 36:14.440
at work for something I don't really want to do.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.080
And it's going to have me basically

36:19.080 --> 36:22.080
getting up at like five thirty in the morning because I start at seven.

36:23.040 --> 36:23.960
So I'm going to be working

36:23.960 --> 36:26.840
like an eight day a week schedule instead of my usual four by ten.

36:28.240 --> 36:31.880
So while I put myself on official vacation,

36:32.280 --> 36:35.080
it doesn't mean I'm not going to be doing some streaming.

36:35.920 --> 36:40.840
Gotcha. So like I'm going to be on Tuesday for some Dead by Daylight.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.120
You know, I'm not going to go without.

36:42.120 --> 36:46.240
And I might play, you know, might log in to play Dreamlight Valley

36:46.240 --> 36:50.560
or check out the I think there's some new content for Cult of the Lamb.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.080
So we'll see.

36:53.080 --> 36:57.360
I mean, I'm not going to be not streaming, but I'm not going to be on any kind

36:57.360 --> 37:00.000
of official schedule until

37:01.360 --> 37:04.280
the first Saturday in September.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.040
OK, but that's the second, I believe.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.520
Yeah, which is funny.

37:08.520 --> 37:12.360
That's also the day after mine and the spouses

37:12.920 --> 37:15.320
18th anniversary.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.040
Cute. And the day before an episode, we won't be here

37:20.080 --> 37:22.160
because I'll be out in Atlanta Labor Day weekend.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.200
So more streaming.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.000
Well, yeah, I guess I could do that or maybe maybe I'll sneak.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.760
Maybe we'll get the cons one of the consoles hooked up

37:31.240 --> 37:33.560
and play something together.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.640
Who knows? There you go.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.160
Maybe some Burning Rangers might happen.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.560
All right. Well, let's move on to Loki.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.800
I feel like we probably talked about a lot about your week in the earlier chat.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.160
But let me check in anyway. How was your gaming week, Loki?

37:46.160 --> 37:48.840
It was mostly editing, actually.

37:48.840 --> 37:53.120
I've been trying to edit my final episode put together and all that stuff

37:53.120 --> 37:56.840
and doing some edits and just,

37:57.240 --> 37:59.320
you know, a lot of video editing stuff.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.840
Minecraft wise, I did play on MCC,

38:04.760 --> 38:09.480
the practice server for a bit, and I was getting slightly better at Ace Race.

38:10.080 --> 38:14.400
That is until, you know, the trainers came in

38:14.400 --> 38:16.240
and then they decided to blow all the records away.

38:16.240 --> 38:21.040
But I got my time under three thirty, which was pretty decent,

38:21.040 --> 38:24.080
considering that when I had started like 30 minutes before that,

38:24.080 --> 38:25.680
I was at eight minutes.

38:25.680 --> 38:29.320
So I'm still having trouble with

38:30.720 --> 38:33.600
the I bet there's some people that won't practice at all.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.120
I mean, there's people there.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.600
There's people that just all they're doing is grinding times on that.

38:38.600 --> 38:42.400
In fact, my my teammate is doing that right now.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.960
Or I think he was. They were doing that.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.240
You know, a little bit ago.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.840
So, yeah, they've been grinding times on that for whatever reason.

38:50.840 --> 38:54.280
But we've been playing some of the different games like they have

38:55.040 --> 38:57.400
parkour tag and

38:58.800 --> 39:01.520
dodge bolt, which I don't know why we're playing that,

39:01.520 --> 39:03.640
because that's for the top two teams and.

39:04.680 --> 39:07.040
We're not going to get the top two

39:07.680 --> 39:09.760
and what else a hole in the wall.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.240
Hole in the wall is fun.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.640
I found a way to cheese that game.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.000
I was able to actually get under some of the

39:16.240 --> 39:18.960
the walls. It doesn't work all the time, though. And then.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.080
Was it the park or a rocket

39:24.080 --> 39:26.240
Spleef rocket, Spleef Rush is pretty fun.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.800
We actually did get to.

39:27.800 --> 39:32.760
So two weeks ago when we were not announcing anything yet,

39:33.560 --> 39:37.280
we did get to go on to the actual MCC server,

39:37.280 --> 39:38.600
like the one that the event's going to be on.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.320
So we we get to play Ace Race.

39:41.320 --> 39:45.640
Of course, in that I came in dead last because I have the habit of using

39:46.320 --> 39:48.280
pushing forward twice to sprint.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.120
You cannot do that.

39:49.120 --> 39:52.080
That is not a good way to keep sprinting.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.560
So now I've fixed that.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.880
And then we also played rocket Spleef Rush, which was fun.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.520
Basically, you have a rocket launcher

39:58.520 --> 40:01.080
and you have to keep yourself up in the air without falling into the void.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.120
And then other people can like knock you off things.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.480
And it's a lot of fun.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.880
But yeah, it was just fun just to get to walk around that

40:08.920 --> 40:11.240
that server and everything and just see everything.

40:11.440 --> 40:14.240
They've got a memorial to Technoblade there, which is pretty cool

40:14.240 --> 40:16.720
because he participated in a lot of different events.

40:18.080 --> 40:20.280
Yeah, it's just I'm very excited to see what happens.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.560
I don't know what to expect yet.

40:23.040 --> 40:23.960
The games look fun.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.840
Like there's a game called Sands of Time where

40:27.680 --> 40:29.440
you basically have to go through all these different vaults.

40:29.440 --> 40:33.280
It's like a like an ancient Egyptian tomb, I guess.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.600
You have to go through all these vaults and like there's different puzzles

40:35.600 --> 40:38.960
and parkour and enemies, you have to fight and stuff

40:38.960 --> 40:41.760
and you have to keep collecting sand so that it doesn't run out.

40:41.760 --> 40:45.960
You have a big sand timer and you have to get out of the vault

40:45.960 --> 40:50.280
with all your coins or as many coins as you can is the aim of the game.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.160
So that looks like fun.

40:52.160 --> 40:55.520
I'm hoping there's one that they've got, which I probably like this.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.800
So it's what's it called? It's.

41:01.120 --> 41:03.600
It's it's a building game, you have to build

41:03.840 --> 41:06.640
basically something that they have built already,

41:06.800 --> 41:10.840
but you have to go find the pieces of that build in like a shopping mall

41:10.840 --> 41:12.120
or like a supermarket.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.800
It's almost supermarket sweep.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.600
OK, that sounds fun.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.440
So that that looks like a lot of fun.

41:18.440 --> 41:21.920
And then there's Grid Wars, which is another one, which is puzzle rooms

41:21.920 --> 41:23.960
that you go into and you have to do different things like,

41:24.200 --> 41:28.840
you know, get a minecart from one side to another or shoot targets on a wall

41:28.840 --> 41:33.640
or solve word puzzles, solve different other puzzles in there.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.640
And they have like survival games and stuff like that.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.640
So there's a lot of interesting things.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.200
I think we're have a lot of fun with it.

41:39.200 --> 41:43.480
But yeah, so that and then getting my season three stuff

41:44.760 --> 41:46.040
started on Channel 64.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.120
So I had all the server maintenance stuff I was doing with that.

41:48.840 --> 41:53.160
I did end up playing two days worth of season three.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.040
I've already got my iron farm and build your breeder and all that stuff.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.080
Still trying to figure out

41:57.080 --> 41:59.240
what I'm going to even film for a first episode yet.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.120
So it's fun.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.800
Lots of it's nice to get to see all the new people

42:04.800 --> 42:06.480
that are going to join the server this season.

42:06.480 --> 42:10.280
So a lot of fresh new faces that are been around

42:10.280 --> 42:12.440
while in our discord for a while.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.240
And I'm very excited to play with them.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.440
So, yeah, just the whole season and a lot, lot going on.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.280
I really want to pass this week.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.320
It's going to be a lot less stressful, that's for sure.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.400
I'm sure you're going to do great again.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.840
If you don't do great, make it funny.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.560
It'll be fine.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.800
We're going to make it funny, regardless of whether we do great or not.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.200
All right. Awesome.

42:31.200 --> 42:34.200
And for the life folks, sorry, I keep looking at my phone.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.960
I'm getting updates from my sister who is in Long Beach, as I'm sure

42:37.960 --> 42:40.320
you know, Southern California is getting hit with a hurricane.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.600
Well, I guess tropical storm at this point.

42:42.600 --> 42:46.400
But point being, the last time California was hit with one of those

42:46.680 --> 42:48.400
was in the 1930s.

42:48.400 --> 42:52.720
So, you know, California covers not built for that type of thing.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.680
So no. Yeah.

42:54.680 --> 42:59.200
My friend or my sister is in Long Beach and just sent me like the

43:00.040 --> 43:03.160
I guess she has like a bamboo thing outside that just completely is

43:03.320 --> 43:04.680
because, of course, it's all messed up now.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.040
It's like made out of bamboo.

43:06.040 --> 43:09.280
So, yeah, and as Rama points out in chat, then an earthquake happens.

43:09.280 --> 43:13.600
So we definitely had the earthquake of 2023, by the way,

43:13.600 --> 43:15.400
because it did come up in Discord.

43:15.400 --> 43:19.000
We're nowhere near that, even though we're also in California is nowhere.

43:19.120 --> 43:21.040
We're not even expected to get rain in the forecast.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.680
It's cloudy outside and that's it.

43:22.680 --> 43:28.120
So and I used my favorite graphic in our Discord over at vognetwork.com

43:28.120 --> 43:31.280
slash Discord, which shows California, but it shows it on the East Coast.

43:31.640 --> 43:34.960
So I was able to say, OK, the hurricane is hitting North Carolina

43:35.120 --> 43:38.720
and we live near we live in Pennsylvania near the border of New York.

43:38.920 --> 43:41.040
So we're not we're not anywhere near that.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.680
But obviously, lots of people we know are

43:44.480 --> 43:46.320
and including folks who listen to this show.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.720
So I hope everyone is doing OK.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.680
And part of the storm system is heading in toward Nevada.

43:51.720 --> 43:54.280
So it's actually doing a big circle.

43:54.280 --> 43:57.720
Yeah, yeah. And and I mean, it is so funny.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.120
My mom's like, you warn him about the bread famine.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.920
What I was like, I'm curious to see if the bread famine actually happens.

44:06.160 --> 44:08.800
OK, there is a southern phenomenon when a hurricane hits.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.600
Well, there's two. There's, of course, the Waffle House index.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.840
Yeah. Yeah, that I know about.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.200
The other one is that if you were a little bit late going to the grocery store.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.200
All that's left are hot dog buns.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.640
Only hot dog buns.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.720
Only and Bobby is right about about.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.400
Yep. The milk, milk toast.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.760
Yep. Milk and bread, milk and bread.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.280
But the big thing is that the only thing left is hot dog buns.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.920
If you're bread, man, my kids would be so stoked about that.

44:41.920 --> 44:42.640
That's all they eat.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.560
I mean, people panic by here, too, for big storms.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.800
It's I don't know if it's that same thing.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.640
But yeah. Yeah.

44:49.640 --> 44:53.080
Even like when we get like a lot of rain, everyone just like buying out everything.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.800
I was gonna say we had storms of 70 mile an hour winds over the winter.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.280
We just didn't call them hurricanes because they weren't, you know,

44:58.280 --> 45:00.640
the right because they weren't the right formation.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.800
But they still had very strong winds.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.120
But like my mom's like,

45:06.280 --> 45:08.640
is it going to be a straight line or a swerve?

45:09.400 --> 45:10.400
The swerve. All right.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.520
Y'all are OK. Mm hmm.

45:12.520 --> 45:16.320
Because I mean, that's the thing is that when you grow up, when there's hurricanes,

45:16.800 --> 45:18.840
you're just sort of like, oh, OK, this again.

45:19.040 --> 45:22.640
I mean, even though, yeah, the really big ones can be scary.

45:22.640 --> 45:26.320
You know, the thing is that you prepare for them all pretty much the same way.

45:27.520 --> 45:33.000
You have you fill your your tub with water and put a cap full of bleach in it.

45:35.040 --> 45:38.280
So that you have clean drinking water, even if it's nasty.

45:39.880 --> 45:43.080
You know, basically just disinfected water to have.

45:43.400 --> 45:48.520
I guess modern day, you don't really need to tape up your windows,

45:48.520 --> 45:51.880
but when I was a kid, you always, you know, duct taped your windows

45:51.880 --> 45:54.880
so that if they broke, they wouldn't shatter. Right.

45:56.320 --> 46:00.200
You know, just you stock up on food, you stock up on toilet paper,

46:00.200 --> 46:02.800
you make sure that you've done all your laundry.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.960
You make sure you've got coolers.

46:04.960 --> 46:07.240
If you're lucky, you have a gas generator.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.440
My uncle has a couple of them.

46:09.480 --> 46:13.760
But the thing also is that houses back

46:13.760 --> 46:17.120
where I'm from are built out of concrete.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.920
Yeah. And metal. Yeah. And brick.

46:20.880 --> 46:24.640
And houses out here are not are built out of plywood. Yeah.

46:25.800 --> 46:29.120
They're built more for earthquake stuff than they are hurricane stuff.

46:29.120 --> 46:33.360
So if that I don't know, I've seen some rickety construction.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.960
I mean, honestly, I don't know that a plywood building like what we have here

46:37.640 --> 46:39.280
has the right kind of foundation

46:39.280 --> 46:42.000
for a lot of developments to withstand an earthquake.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.080
I mean, here in Sacramento, it's not bad. We don't really get them.

46:44.560 --> 46:46.400
But I don't know.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.320
Wait, wait, let me get to my gaming week.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.680
Talk about weather. No, it's fine. Sorry.

46:50.680 --> 46:53.920
But with my gaming week, I want to talk about just

46:54.400 --> 46:56.520
honestly, I didn't really play anything new, new.

46:56.520 --> 46:57.800
I did play some theater rhythm,

46:57.800 --> 47:00.400
which I had streamed a little bit because I was behind on DLC.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.600
So I'm finally caught up.

47:01.600 --> 47:05.200
I've played every song once still in the game, hundreds of songs.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.040
So that's good.

47:07.040 --> 47:11.360
And Diablo four, still my seasonal character has finally caught up

47:11.360 --> 47:15.520
to my forever character by hitting level 61 today.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.240
So still working on that.

47:17.240 --> 47:20.680
And then I've actually been playing a bit more Overwatch two randomly.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.040
I have a couple of friend groups that are super into it.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.160
They keep trying to get me to play. So I'm like, OK.

47:25.160 --> 47:28.760
And I'm finding like, oh, I'm maybe like I don't think I'm good at it,

47:28.760 --> 47:30.920
but like I'm like, OK, maybe I'm not bad at it.

47:30.920 --> 47:34.360
Like I thought like I was actually the thing about Overwatch

47:34.400 --> 47:36.200
that I do know how to do

47:36.200 --> 47:40.200
is I know how to change my hero to respond to the situation

47:40.400 --> 47:45.040
that if the character I'm using is not working, I know to change to somebody else.

47:45.040 --> 47:49.200
Like if we are having a really hard time picking off healers and I'm on DPS

47:49.200 --> 47:52.320
and you know, maybe I'm Farah or somebody is just having a hard time,

47:52.560 --> 47:55.840
you know, well, Farah can sometimes hit the back line depending on the map.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.600
But like, I should switch to Widowmaker.

47:58.600 --> 48:02.240
And yes, I actually play Widowmaker and I do pretty decent with her.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.960
But I also know to switch the fuck off of her

48:04.960 --> 48:07.800
if there's a Sombra or somebody that counters are real, real easy.

48:07.800 --> 48:13.080
So yeah, like that's that's my biggest asset is I don't stick to one hero hero.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.800
I try to play a variety.

48:14.800 --> 48:15.960
So there is that.

48:15.960 --> 48:20.280
So I honestly, that was really it for my gaming week.

48:20.520 --> 48:22.120
I didn't play a lot of new stuff,

48:22.120 --> 48:23.880
but I'm sure that will change in the coming weeks.

48:23.880 --> 48:25.840
So. All right.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.760
Quickly, before we get into the other news, I do.

48:27.760 --> 48:31.760
I do also want to give a plug to our growing YouTube presence over at

48:31.960 --> 48:33.920
YouTube VOG Network.

48:33.920 --> 48:35.560
That's VOG Network on YouTube.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.400
Just posted a couple more videos this week.

48:37.400 --> 48:40.160
Last week, Dark Soccer and I talked about the Alien DLC

48:40.160 --> 48:41.960
and Shane and I talked about Fan Fest.

48:41.960 --> 48:45.960
Shane and I got together again to do a Final Fantasy 16 spoiler chat.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.960
So that is available now over on YouTube.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.880
If you've beaten the game or you just don't care

48:49.880 --> 48:52.360
and you want to hear impressions anyway about the game.

48:52.360 --> 48:57.040
And then I spent quite some time this I did a 20 minute video

48:57.040 --> 49:00.280
talking about Pokemon Go routes in the game and that feature.

49:00.320 --> 49:01.880
But the reason why I talked so long about it

49:01.880 --> 49:05.720
is I also related it to a similar thing in Ingress missions.

49:05.720 --> 49:08.000
And I kind of talked about the similarities, the differences,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.920
and why didn't they just copy paste what they already had

49:10.920 --> 49:12.240
and maybe try to get into some of that.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.320
So it's a little bit of a deep dive in the feature and all that.

49:14.320 --> 49:16.640
And I actually recorded myself doing this.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.240
So I'm actually playing the game, but it's obviously time delayed.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.560
I'm not out doing it in the real world.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.720
But it was stuff I had recorded the day before

49:22.720 --> 49:24.560
while I happened to be at the mall,

49:24.560 --> 49:27.160
you know, doing a route there to kind of show what that's all about.

49:27.640 --> 49:31.000
And I understand Go Fest in that game was happening this weekend.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.080
I still don't know if I'm going to buy a ticket to the global one next weekend.

49:35.080 --> 49:40.280
I'm not, although I like the routes feature and I like, you know,

49:40.280 --> 49:43.760
overall some of Pokemon Go's features and getting out and moving.

49:43.760 --> 49:47.400
I don't know if I agree with a lot of the direction the game's taken this year.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.920
I still don't think Niantic has properly apologized

49:50.920 --> 49:54.160
for what they did with the whole remote raid situation and all that.

49:54.160 --> 49:58.560
And I think the best way to express my frustration is to vote my wallet.

49:58.560 --> 50:02.920
And I feel like the only thing I don't have that I would get from paying for it

50:02.920 --> 50:06.840
would be the new legendary, which whatever you never use those

50:07.040 --> 50:10.320
those legendaries from Go Fest, you never actually use them in the game.

50:10.600 --> 50:14.760
I think maybe Victini is the only one I ever actually use once in a great while.

50:15.560 --> 50:20.120
And then that and M unknown.

50:20.120 --> 50:23.560
I don't have an unknown M and I have like at least 15 letters.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.560
I don't have M. That's the only one I need.

50:25.560 --> 50:28.760
But like, I know I have friends that will play that will get plenty and I can just trade.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.240
That's it. Yeah.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.160
SG100Matt in chat says, I'm not buying it.

50:32.160 --> 50:33.240
Go Fest a bit of dud.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.760
And like Rob is saying, not happy with what Niantic has been doing.

50:35.760 --> 50:37.360
Yeah, I think I'm going to vote my wallet.

50:37.360 --> 50:38.960
I will probably still go out and play.

50:38.960 --> 50:40.000
So maybe I'm not helping.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.560
Maybe I'm being, you know, but I'll go out and catch shinies.

50:43.560 --> 50:46.960
But that's more about me walking and just having incentive to do that

50:46.960 --> 50:49.160
and go, you know, around downtown or something.

50:49.160 --> 50:52.600
But that's because I kind of want to I want this weekend.

50:52.600 --> 50:59.240
I want to do activities that are very like by myself because with Dragon Con coming up,

50:59.240 --> 51:03.040
I don't want to catch covid two days before I leave for Dragon Con

51:03.040 --> 51:05.400
because then that would be catastrophic

51:05.400 --> 51:09.200
and really take away a lot of the awesome opportunities coming my way at Dragon Con this year

51:09.200 --> 51:11.280
because I wouldn't be able to go.

51:11.280 --> 51:14.640
So I'm going to just kind of keep to myself this next weekend and all that good stuff.

51:14.640 --> 51:20.240
I realize, well, if I may, also spending a little bit of time by yourself

51:20.240 --> 51:22.480
would be good for a little bit of self centering.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.200
Yeah, no, you're around so many people.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.040
For sure. For sure.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.200
It's charging the batteries before extrovert central, for sure.

51:28.400 --> 51:32.000
And then it's like, I know I'm putting myself in a very risky situation,

51:32.000 --> 51:35.920
but, you know, I, I have to weigh the pros and cons on stuff.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.040
I'll wear a mask.

51:37.040 --> 51:40.960
And especially when crossing through the hotels and places like that,

51:40.960 --> 51:43.440
just where I know it's going to be.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.960
So, you know, try to protect myself that way.

51:45.960 --> 51:48.240
But I know what we could do.

51:48.240 --> 51:51.520
We could put a gas mask on you and have you walk around going, are you my mommy?

51:51.520 --> 51:54.720
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Part of my cosplay out of it's. Yeah.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.760
Yeah. An episode of Doctor Who.

51:56.760 --> 52:01.880
Yeah. Yeah. Or, you know, cosplaying somebody that was a pandemic.

52:02.960 --> 52:06.480
1920s with a big what do you what do they call the big beak masks?

52:07.560 --> 52:08.480
Oh, plague doctor.

52:08.480 --> 52:11.000
Yeah, like a plague doctor cosplaying a plague doctor.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.640
Well, that wasn't the 1920s.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.840
Yeah, that was way back when.

52:16.080 --> 52:18.240
There's there's a lot about those, though,

52:18.240 --> 52:21.000
that that isn't historically accurate, but I digress.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.800
All right. Anyway, oh, great.

52:23.800 --> 52:25.000
I have one I can lend you.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.040
Matt says I have an M unknown.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.440
Perfect. Perfect. All right.

52:29.440 --> 52:30.320
Let's move on.

52:30.320 --> 52:34.360
Let's get into the news this week and we will start with Loki.

52:35.320 --> 52:38.840
Yep. So Twitch is actually going to allow us

52:38.840 --> 52:42.280
to now block banned users from watching your stream.

52:42.280 --> 52:45.400
So apparently you could just, you know, prevent them from actually chatting.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.480
But now you can prevent them from actually watching.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.360
So they can't harass you in other ways.

52:51.360 --> 52:53.520
This is the first on my list.

52:53.520 --> 52:56.640
This is supposed to be coming sometime in September.

52:57.120 --> 53:00.080
And when you block or ban someone,

53:00.440 --> 53:03.680
they'll no longer be able to view your stream, I think by default.

53:04.520 --> 53:06.800
So that's that's nice.

53:08.840 --> 53:11.800
It doesn't stop people from watching your VODs, though.

53:12.800 --> 53:17.920
But it's a starting for your clips, which would be part of your VODs, right?

53:19.440 --> 53:21.840
I mean, I'm kind of surprised this feature wasn't already in there,

53:22.080 --> 53:25.560
but like, wouldn't all you have to do is log out and you could still see it

53:25.560 --> 53:28.440
like that's that's what you can kind of do to read Twitter's

53:28.440 --> 53:29.440
where people have blocked you.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.560
You just I may or may not know this from experience.

53:31.560 --> 53:34.360
You can just log out and you can read it.

53:34.360 --> 53:38.040
Now, if they're friends locked and they've blocked you,

53:38.360 --> 53:39.960
then you're really not going to be able to read it.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.720
That's the only way. But nobody's friends locked on Twitch.

53:42.960 --> 53:44.920
What? Technically, the options there.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.080
But why would you use it?

53:46.080 --> 53:50.560
You would you wouldn't you know, you'd just be you wouldn't grow at all.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.200
You can't you can't do it that way. So.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.360
But yeah, I mean, I do agree

53:56.360 --> 53:59.440
that people shouldn't be watching a channel they've been banned from.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.760
So it's it's something like that.

54:01.760 --> 54:05.560
Didrom S says Twitch is trying to tie it to your IP address

54:05.560 --> 54:08.480
where you still can't view if you're logged out soon.

54:08.480 --> 54:09.840
You won't be able to block on birds.

54:09.840 --> 54:12.760
Oh, well, don't don't get me started on the VPN, though.

54:12.760 --> 54:15.680
Yeah. VPNs are easy. I've used VPN.

54:15.680 --> 54:17.640
I am a technological.

54:19.040 --> 54:22.200
You know, I don't know my stuff a lot, but I've used a VPN.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.480
I had to to play Fafasci 14 for a minute

54:25.240 --> 54:28.560
when I had my former Internet provider was having issues of 14.

54:28.560 --> 54:30.640
I used a VPN to get around it.

54:30.640 --> 54:33.200
So as Joe and Matt says, good.

54:33.200 --> 54:35.480
Twitch should also tell them to go outside, touch grass

54:35.480 --> 54:37.840
and stop being a shit to people.

54:37.880 --> 54:38.480
That would be funny.

54:38.480 --> 54:40.600
If that was a splash screen, you could show ban people.

54:41.720 --> 54:45.040
Why just Mariah Carey's obsessed album cover?

54:45.880 --> 54:49.680
I can think of, though, another thing that I don't like about it

54:50.640 --> 54:55.120
is that just think if someone that you had banned

54:55.120 --> 55:00.120
from talking in your chat could still add to your viewer numbers.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.880
Oh, like one of those like tab.

55:05.360 --> 55:07.480
Thanks. Thanks for like.

55:07.480 --> 55:09.080
Thanks for giving me free content.

55:09.080 --> 55:11.680
Right. What some people would do when they would get hate

55:11.680 --> 55:14.720
rated is they would immediately run ads on their channel and be like,

55:14.720 --> 55:15.640
thanks for the revenue.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.800
Basically, that's what I've done.

55:17.800 --> 55:20.720
That type of thinking. Yeah. Yeah, I do get that.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.080
Yeah. All right.

55:24.080 --> 55:27.080
Well, let's move on to something that hopefully doesn't have to ban

55:27.080 --> 55:30.480
a lot of people when they broadcast on different streaming services,

55:30.480 --> 55:32.640
and that's the Pokemon Championships.

55:33.640 --> 55:36.760
The Pokemon Company announced at the end of their championships

55:36.760 --> 55:40.520
that Honolulu is going to be the place where the Pokemon

55:40.520 --> 55:44.360
World Championships 2024 will be occurring.

55:44.560 --> 55:48.200
Now, obviously, this timing is not great

55:48.640 --> 55:52.040
with what is going on in Hawaii right now, because there's a lot of debate

55:52.040 --> 55:55.040
about is tourism appropriate in Hawaii right now and all this with what's

55:55.040 --> 55:58.880
going on with the Maui wildfires, which continue to be extremely devastating.

55:59.040 --> 56:02.800
However, Pokemon Company is doing a very good thing here

56:02.960 --> 56:06.600
that they are making an immediate monetary donation of two hundred

56:06.600 --> 56:09.600
thousand dollars to help relief efforts.

56:09.600 --> 56:10.880
In a statement, they said,

56:10.880 --> 56:14.320
Our hearts go out to all those who've been impacted by the devastating wildfires

56:14.320 --> 56:16.840
in Hawaii to support relief efforts.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.880
The Pokemon Company International is making an immediate monetary donation

56:19.880 --> 56:22.480
of two hundred thousand dollars to its partner at Global Giving

56:22.480 --> 56:24.920
through its Hawaii Wildlife Relief Fund.

56:24.920 --> 56:27.320
To learn more about Global Giving's local relief efforts

56:27.320 --> 56:29.360
and to join in supporting the people of Hawaii,

56:29.360 --> 56:33.600
please visit global giving dot org slash Pokemon.

56:34.160 --> 56:36.960
So that that is nice.

56:37.600 --> 56:41.240
And I'm sure this is the type of thing that contracts were booked.

56:41.480 --> 56:43.200
Venues were negotiated.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.200
Dotted lines were signed.

56:45.200 --> 56:48.480
Well, but it is also and I just want it because somebody will correct me

56:48.480 --> 56:49.320
if I don't say it.

56:49.320 --> 56:53.320
Honolulu is on a different island than, you know, Lahaina.

56:53.800 --> 56:58.120
Yes, but certainly the entire state is still feeling the impact

56:58.120 --> 57:01.400
because Oahu is supporting a lot of people

57:01.400 --> 57:05.200
that have suddenly had to relocate off of Maui due to what is going on

57:05.200 --> 57:07.000
and all that, you know, families and all this stuff.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.560
So the brunt of what is happening is being felt everywhere in the state.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.720
So, you know, there's a lot of talk about, you know,

57:12.720 --> 57:15.080
what is and isn't appropriate right now.

57:15.080 --> 57:18.720
But obviously all this stuff was signed and all this stuff well before

57:20.600 --> 57:23.120
the the fires happened. So.

57:23.560 --> 57:28.520
Um. Also, interesting, another game I played this weekend,

57:28.520 --> 57:31.560
I got together with some friends to play our good old Ingress game

57:32.200 --> 57:35.160
because there was a global event happening and there's

57:35.160 --> 57:38.920
there's ways you can kind of help the global event from other places.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.080
So we were getting together to do that.

57:41.360 --> 57:44.960
And there was talk about that there's actually one of these,

57:45.120 --> 57:49.000
you know, events competitions is in Honolulu in December.

57:49.200 --> 57:52.400
Again, it was announced back in January that it was going to be happening

57:52.400 --> 57:54.200
in December in Honolulu.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.960
But now a lot of question about.

57:55.960 --> 57:58.240
I wonder if they'll go through with it at this point.

57:59.400 --> 58:01.960
So it'd be interesting because I really wanted to go at one point.

58:01.960 --> 58:04.960
Now I'm like, no, the the travel dollars this year got spent.

58:05.880 --> 58:07.640
I'm not because there's another one in Tacoma,

58:07.640 --> 58:09.760
but it's the weekend after Dragon Con.

58:09.760 --> 58:12.920
And I was like, oh, there's no way, no way I can go to that.

58:13.800 --> 58:16.480
It's too close to Dragon Con.

58:16.480 --> 58:18.760
But I was hoping maybe I could make Honolulu work, but.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.000
We're doing TwitchCon instead.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.440
So, yeah, I'm I'm actually I was going to drive to TwitchCon.

58:27.440 --> 58:29.400
I'm thinking about flying instead.

58:29.400 --> 58:32.360
Oh, we're flying, but we have to fly funky because

58:32.800 --> 58:35.400
we're going to Disneyland for Oogie Boogie like the same week.

58:35.800 --> 58:40.640
So we have to fly to Long Beach and then Long Beach to Vegas, Vegas to home.

58:41.240 --> 58:44.720
So I had to book three separate flights.

58:44.720 --> 58:46.920
But yeah, the Vegas flight is so easy.

58:46.920 --> 58:48.920
And there's there you can see.

58:48.920 --> 58:50.920
Yeah, Southwest or Delta out of here.

58:50.920 --> 58:52.440
And I think one other airline does it, too.

58:52.440 --> 58:54.440
Oh, Spirit, but I'd never fly them.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.440
Just say, you know,

58:57.240 --> 58:59.440
Phil, if you get what you pay for related to that.

58:59.920 --> 59:03.600
Phil at night and chat says there's always another con or event around the corner.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.240
Truly, truly.

59:05.240 --> 59:08.560
There are definitely more than I can physically afford

59:08.800 --> 59:11.040
and attend in the same space. So.

59:12.480 --> 59:14.760
Bobby Blackwell says bring me back an Oogie Boogie pin.

59:15.640 --> 59:17.040
Yeah, absolutely.

59:17.040 --> 59:20.680
Bobby Blackwell says be prepared for a possible random screening

59:20.880 --> 59:24.000
because they do take a harder look at people with one way tickets.

59:24.200 --> 59:26.760
Well, both the husband and I have pre check

59:26.760 --> 59:28.800
and I know you can still get picked for one way screenings of that.

59:28.800 --> 59:32.960
But I mean, I'm not worried like they're not going to find anything because we.

59:33.280 --> 59:37.080
And honestly, we don't really we check because we usually fly

59:37.080 --> 59:38.680
Southwest almost all the time.

59:38.680 --> 59:42.800
The only time I don't fly Southwest is when I'm going to Atlanta

59:42.840 --> 59:45.440
and Delta was competitively priced

59:45.440 --> 59:48.960
because your bags go free on Southwest, which is so nice.

59:48.960 --> 59:50.560
So we check all of our bags.

59:50.560 --> 59:55.080
We don't carry anything on except like an actual like entertainment

59:55.080 --> 59:57.000
for the plane bag.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.720
And then like, you know, the things you're supposed to have just in case of

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.440
complete and utter fuck ups in luggage, which, you know, could happen

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.560
like the underwear, bag medicine, things like that. Yeah.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.800
So but, you know, so they're not going to find anything.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.760
So let them pull me.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.000
I don't care. Just leave time for that.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.160
Remember, we're flying out of Sacramento.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.280
So but I guess I guess to be fair, the other flights, you know, Vegas,

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.560
I don't know how thorough or how efficient that airport is.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:29.280
So we'll see. They're pretty efficient from what I remember,

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.600
because I it wasn't there not long ago, but it's a ways off anyway.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.840
All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.480
So. This has been

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.800
going around for a little bit.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.600
I think we expected it.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.840
But now Netflix is going to be opening up

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.520
to a small number of their subscribers in Canada and the UK,

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.080
according to a blog post to roll out

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.280
this video game streaming service.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.560
It's going to select TVs and then PCs and Macs.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.760
X are on there in the next few weeks.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.920
I mean, we basically knew that they were expanding into games

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.960
around 2021 when they had the Netflix game on mobile.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:26.280
But now they're trying to make it available on even more devices

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.840
and setting up a test.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.480
There is a Netflix game controller app in the Apple App Store.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.720
And there's only two games that are going to be part of this test.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.200
One is Oxenfree

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.760
and the other is Mulhugh's Mining Adventure,

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.280
which is a gem mining arcade type game.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.000
You use your phones as a controller.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.640
So for the initial beta test, these TVs and connected

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.520
TV devices will support the games.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.400
And that's the Amazon Fire TV streaming media players, Chromecast

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.320
with Google TV, LG TVs, Nvidia Shield TV,

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.640
Roku devices and TVs, Samsung smart TVs and Walmart on.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:18.760
So, you know, I actually have a Samsung TV, so who knows?

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.520
Or no, my TV's an LG either way, but I'm not in Canada or UK.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.000
But folks who are in those areas, let us know how it goes.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.040
Yeah, if it's successful, it'll certainly roll out of the places, too.

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.200
So there is that. Yeah. All right.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.480
Moving on, Loki's got more on a game I was talking about earlier.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.800
Yeah. So, you know, Overwatch,

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:47.120
they've, you know, had a rough time

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.080
with some decisions that weren't necessarily popular.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.120
And what do people do when they are upset with a company's decision?

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.080
They head on over to Metacritic and review bomb them or the other platforms as well.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.000
So they start a change.org petition.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.440
Yeah, that's what that'll work.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.920
Yeah, for sure.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.760
So, of course, you know, Blizzard has responded to the Overwatch

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.160
to review bombing with PR speak, as to be expected.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.600
This is although being review bombed isn't a fun experience.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It's been great to see lots of new players jump into Overwatch

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.280
two for the first time.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.440
Our goal with Overwatch two is to make the game more accessible

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.200
than ever for more people than ever before.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.920
And, you know, if we can't turn back the clock, then what can we do?

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.440
We keep adding and improving Overwatch two.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.000
This is how we move forward.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.960
If I could turn.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.400
Yeah, but that kind of like also ignores all the fact that like you promise

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.840
something, you didn't deliver it, and now you're charging

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.800
for some of the things that you did promise originally as part of the base package.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.360
That's not really the same thing, but.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:03.160
I mean, what you going to do?

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.200
Blizzard's going to blizzard.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.520
So, you know, honestly, if you're happy with it, play the game.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.200
If you're not happy with it, don't play the game.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.400
I mean, same thing with voting with your wallet.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.800
If you want to pay for that content, then pay for the content.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.800
But really, all you're doing is encouraging them to kind of do this kind of stuff.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.160
I mean, for me, it's no skin off my back because I'm not playing Overwatch two.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.760
And so therefore, the PV stuff doesn't really bother me.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.800
Here's here's how I feel about I want to talk about this, because I recently am more,

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.800
you know, I played Overwatch two for like a week when it first came out.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:43.040
And only recently am I kind of getting back into it just because of friends

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.120
that play it and, you know, peer pressure and playing games

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.320
with friends is always more fun and that type of thing, right?

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.040
Like, am I bothered at the lack of PV because they had promised originally?

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.680
Yeah, I am, because that shit sounded pretty awesome.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.000
And I think it's a real bummer that they haven't really properly delivered on that.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.320
That's why I haven't really given Overwatch any money.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.240
You know, even though I've played it a bit, I really don't spend money on it

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.880
because I'm not I'm not interested in skins and that sort of thing.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.920
I I will openly say, though, and I don't know if this is

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.840
because of, you know, Microsoft coming in in the future or whatever.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.960
They have a deal on Game Pass where you can actually unlock

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:22.360
all the new heroes instantly through the what's her name?

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.200
The brand new one, Alari, the sun healer that just came out.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.400
I'm sorry if I butchered her name, I don't remember the moment

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.960
I've played her like twice because I'm not very good with her.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.800
But you can get all of the heroes on Xbox Game Pass.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.320
Now you get it for the Xbox version of the game.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.840
But now that it's all linked together, you fire up the Xbox version of the game.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.200
And then guess what? It's all unlocked on the PC version of the game.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.920
So I actually got all the heroes that way.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.520
So I guess I've used my Game Pass subscription for that.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.280
But otherwise, I don't really give it money.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.320
But here's the thing, here's the point I really want to make.

01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:00.960
For me, this whole PvE thing is a very similar sort of situation to No Man's Sky.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:05.320
And what I mean by that is when No Man's Sky first came out,

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:10.920
it rightfully took a beating from the gaming public because so much

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.800
that was promised was not delivered on such as, oh, you multiplayer

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.040
and that whole thing, right? Like, yeah, well, the odds are really low.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.880
You'd ever run into somebody in space.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.400
But maybe, you know, maybe you'll see it someday.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.400
And then that turned out that all that all was like a fucking lie.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.000
Like, like you would never actually others see people.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.120
But then they patched it in later.

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:37.240
No Man's Sky got a lot of credit from the gaming public

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.160
back by improving it consistently with patches.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.120
And it took a little while.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.040
But now No Man's Sky is coming up on its seven year anniversary as a game.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.320
And guess what? Guess what they teased on Twitter last week?

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.160
Yet another patch coming for the game with more features and so forth.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.640
That's going to make the game even better.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:00.320
And as somebody who's a big fan now of No Man's Sky, I think that's awesome.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.040
So I think Blizzard should look to that as a model

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.400
for how to turn Overwatch 2 around.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:12.320
Just fucking deliver like people will forgive you if you fucking deliver.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.600
But if you suddenly do the anthem thing

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:22.120
and just shut it down, don't deliver back out and support,

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.360
pull the plug, five dollars on the shelf at GameStop,

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:29.480
then you're going to be you're going to be a laughing stock in history.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.920
I don't know if I don't think Overwatch 2 is really at that level of bad,

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:36.280
but I think people will never be able to get past what was promised,

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:40.880
you know, pre pandemic and so forth if Blizzard were to shut it down.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.640
But I don't see Blizzard doing that either.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.600
I feel like they're still just they're going to make it work one way or the other.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.360
But it's just it's going to take some of these verbal beatings online,

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.320
but continuing to stick to the plan

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.360
and making the game the best possible that it could be.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.360
Yeah, bonds 006 says, LOL,

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.320
are you asking Blizzard to take notes how to improve a game in good faith?

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.680
Well, although I understand what you're saying, I got two words for you.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.920
Diablo 3.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:16.520
Questbuster in chat says No Man's Sky was functional at launch

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.280
and minimally viable enough to play with, but it was incredibly shallow.

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.640
And this is from someone that actually completed a trip to the center of the galaxy.

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.400
Today's No Man's Sky, though repeating what Rob is saying is pretty incredible stuff.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:29.360
Absolutely. You know, it'd be interesting.

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:34.640
I got to I'm trying to find my disc copy of No Man's Sky

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.360
because I have that original 1.0 version.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.280
I'd love to go back and play that again

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:42.920
just to see how much has changed from the very beginning,

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.200
because I bet it's pretty new.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.760
I think it would, because you can play it offline.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.960
You just pull the.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.400
I mean, I'd have to have I'd have to have a PS4 to play it on.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:57.240
But I could do mine. Yeah.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.640
So or just remove everything that's on my PS4.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.680
But yeah, anyway.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.120
Yeah. Questbuster says OMG, so much stuff is different.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.280
It'd really be interesting to see.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.520
I'm sure someone on YouTube's done it, but maybe I need to do it, too.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.600
We'll see. We'll see. Anyway.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:15.920
So, you know, I do you know, as somebody who wants to see Blizzard succeed

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.080
eventually, like obviously I've had my criticisms of them as a company,

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.920
and pretty much all of that can be traced to either people

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:28.840
that are no longer with Blizzard or one particular Activision CEO

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.600
who is continues to be a poison toxic individual in this industry

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.560
that is long overstayed, is welcome and easy to get the fuck out of here.

01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.040
But unfortunately is hanging on for that separation fee.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.040
You know, that will inevitably come once this Microsoft merger goes through.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.240
But it's not a court case supposed to be coming up here soon.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.000
Like I thought it was at the end of this month.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.080
I think so. I think so.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.680
Maybe that's actually just apart from him.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.240
I also have problems with certain people

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.440
that play that game that I don't want to associate with.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.360
All right, let's move on to our next story,

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.280
which I think is me.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:07.600
Yes, it is. All right.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:10.840
So there's been a lot of talk about the Steam Deck.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.760
The Steam Deck is, of course,

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.400
a physical hardware device that's been doing very well.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.040
And there's people like me that are like, you know,

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.840
I'll be interested in getting a Steam Deck

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.880
when they release a more powerful Steam Deck,

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.640
because we know it's coming eventually, but not yet.

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.320
But that hasn't because basically a Steam Deck is,

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.720
you know, it's a PC device.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.520
It's not proprietary based stuff.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.960
We're seeing more competitors happen.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.880
And so now we're going to have one that's incoming from Lenovo.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.760
And some leaked images have revealed that the Lenovo Legion Go

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.440
is part Steam Deck and part Nintendo Switch.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:54.320
When we talk about the removable little devices

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.080
that click into the monitor, it's certainly that whole thing.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.320
So it was reported by Windows Central

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.440
that Lenovo was working on a handheld gaming PC that runs Windows.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.800
Windows Report this week published the first images of the device,

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.840
allegedly what it is, you know, could be an elaborate Photoshop.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.320
But I don't know. I don't know.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.800
This one looks like it could be pretty, pretty solid.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.120
Apparently, there is also one that shows that AR glasses

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.960
could be working with the device as well.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.400
It could be something else that, you know, this this device is bringing.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.320
So we'll see.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.160
Apparently, the device has a kickstand similar to a Switch

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.800
that you can use to lean the screen back

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.520
so you can pick up the controllers and play as well.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:40.880
So it's really a little bit of a blend of the Switch and the Steam Deck.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:47.120
So, yeah, also, Lenovo is making the device pretty.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:51.240
It's it's kind of thick and, you know, it's it's it's got a lot to it.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:52.920
But I'm assuming that's to support,

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.280
you know, battery life and power in that device and so forth.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.800
So the AR glasses in the report, supposedly part of an ecosystem

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:03.640
that is going to be launched alongside the Legion Go.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.600
In the leaked promotional image, somebody wearing the glasses

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.440
is looking at the game on a screen that's projected in midair.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.840
Who knows if this is something sold separately or a bundle?

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.840
I would hope it's sold separately because you don't

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.160
you don't want to bundle required hardware

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.400
unless it is damn proven hardware like the Nintendo.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.600
We got away with it.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.760
It was central to that device.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.000
The Xbox one, when they bundled connect.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.840
Yeah, it didn't go so well.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.520
So just, you know, food for thought.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.080
The Legion Go will run Windows 11.

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:40.000
So you should be able to run anything that runs on Windows 11,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.040
which is most games that you see on the Steam marketplace.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.320
That's for sure. So is it going to have any sort of though,

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.280
like video out from it? Like.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.160
Does it say anything about that?

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.000
That is a good question, because it didn't really say about like, does it?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.480
Does it pop into a dock or something like that?

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.880
I'm not sure I see anything like that.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.320
I'm trying to look at the leaked image of the device to see if I see an output.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.400
And I don't see one in those pictures,

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.160
but I also can't see the bottom of the device where it would logically be.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.960
So I can't rule it out yet.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.760
But again, while this is still a rumor,

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.920
we're going to have to wait for the official announcement to know

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.480
how would it hook up?

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.400
Is it is there like a dock type of thing or just an HDMI output

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:22.680
or something like that?

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.360
We'd have to hear more about that.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.960
Yeah, same, same.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.600
So because I mean, I will.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:32.080
I mean, then again, I have a I have a reason now that I could get a steam

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.880
because I mean, the biggest problem people are having with Steamdex

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.800
as well was that not everything was Linux compatible. Mm hmm.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.880
You know, like that was what was holding me off from Dead by Daylight, for example.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.080
They've they've since put in that compatibility

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.000
and a lot more games are compatible.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.160
I don't know if power would be.

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:55.040
I mean, it's just a side note. Yeah.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.400
All right. Well, moving on to

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.000
a really interesting story at our Sakura.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.120
So. I have to give some some preface to this.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:16.640
So there is a developer named Luke Bernard who released a game this year.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.080
It came out.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.640
I think it officially came out in June, July,

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.400
that's called A Light in the Darkness, and in this game,

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:32.760
you play as a French Jewish family in the years preceding and during the Holocaust.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:40.240
And it's it's it's a very realistic

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.960
game for experience and it's free.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.880
But the he was, you know, sort of inspired

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.040
to start the idea after he found out that his

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.440
grandmother was part of the.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.920
British resistance that smuggled children out of

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.240
out of Nazi occupied regions

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:12.440
and that that he's Jewish by by maternal line.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.440
So at any rate,

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.880
he started, you know, in trying to find places to get his game to go,

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:26.320
you know, eventually was wanting to make sure that video games could be used

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.200
as educational tools for keeping the history of this

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:38.120
horrific event live in modern memory, you know, because our

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.280
our survivors are almost all gone, you know.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.000
And so he

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.200
is working with the the Fortnite people.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.800
And so now in in Fortnite, there is a Holocaust museum.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:04.960
And basically you can go in and see

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:11.560
in a certain certain stories, you know, basically there was a lot of

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:18.000
a lot of restrictions and different things that made it very difficult.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.720
But now there are certain stories that are being told

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:30.080
through this sort of educational museum within the game.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.600
And so there there have been.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.920
Some people who are against it, who don't think that, you know,

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.120
putting it in a video game, you know, would be best

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.760
because it might trivialize it or that there's a thing to win.

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.760
But, you know, there's other people who are like, yeah,

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.720
you can tell a story through a game.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:57.160
And so that's, I think, a big step on this is having this sort of museum

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.840
now inside a Fortnite.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:05.080
So can I can I say sorry?

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.200
I just want to mention a hard pass on that perspective

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:11.080
that this somehow trivializes it by putting it in Fortnite.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:14.680
I'm sorry, I see this as teaching the people that need to be taught

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.040
this sort of stuff, meeting them where they are.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.600
That's that's what this is.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.600
This this really kind of speaks to me in a similar kind of capacity

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:25.920
to how when we were young, you know, we would go to the computer lab

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:29.720
on an Apple IIe and on Fridays we would play games.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.360
But on other days we might play something like, you know,

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.080
the Oregon Trail or something where we were learning

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.560
or even doing like simple logo, we're actually learning.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.280
Now, obviously, it was nothing learning about history in this regard.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.680
But I think we know that, you know, with Fortnite being this,

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.240
you know, game engine and a lot of people, a lot of kids,

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.400
especially around the age of Loki's kids, I would imagine they know Fortnite.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.080
They that's, you know, they don't like Fortnite, but they know interesting.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.200
I thought there were a lot of kids that do like Fortnite.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:01.240
But, you know, there are might not my kids.

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.600
My kids are Roblox kids, unfortunately, Fortnite kids.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.880
But now they're like, they're too cool for Fortnite.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.160
But still, I think it's meeting a lot more.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.120
Yeah, OK, there's a lot more about it, though.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:18.960
So he's been trying to partner with the Anti-Defamation League,

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.920
who have been very silent with him.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.000
And, you know.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.840
They're trying, they are working with the group Lost Tribe, though,

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:36.760
for combating the casual anti-Semitism

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.520
that you, you know, people encounter online, including in games.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.400
They have found so much anti-Semitism

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.440
just rampant on Discord, on Twitch,

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.920
even incorporated into game storylines,

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:59.760
although I guess not consciously, you know, it's just this

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.760
built in culture.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:08.360
And, you know, they're trying to,

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.720
you know, they even, you know, he's even talking about,

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.480
you know, trying to get Activision to make changes.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.400
That, you know, because Call of Duty has especially big anti-Semitic community.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:28.400
And so going on further, though,

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.360
is that this Fortnite museum

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.280
have basically their on-screen

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.800
communication tools are disabled.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.720
They cannot manipulate the environment at all.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:49.280
They are basically making it like a real museum you go in.

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.200
And so.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.760
There are, you know.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.080
Like this is one on here, it's basically

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.560
the CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, of ADL

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:14.040
was saying that it could be potentially worthwhile.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.360
But he goes on to say, and I'm going to read a quote,

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.800
until the game industry can change the norms of hate and abuse

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:23.080
in online multiplayer games, we cannot view experiences like these

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:27.480
as a true alternative to more traditional forms of Holocaust education.

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.680
But it's something it's doing something right.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.160
I understand the frustration and the comment.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.040
And I don't want to say, like, I outright disagree with it.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.360
But I would encourage that person to kind of take the alternate perspective of,

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:42.160
again, sometimes you have to meet the people where they are.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:45.120
And it's that kind of thing where, you know, by going to Fortnite

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.000
and showing, you know, people like when you use that language,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.320
that's this is what it means.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.280
You know, this is what it really is.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.360
And actually, you know, something to keep in the back of our minds.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.960
This is not the first time Fortnite has taken on a very serious topic

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.800
like this with a educational museum interactive experience.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.240
It was just I think it was a couple of years ago,

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.760
but there was the whole Martin Luther King March for Time thing

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.200
that came right around that time of, you know, a lot of the

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:13.520
racial, you know, injustice, you know, talks that were happening in this country.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.800
We saw that experience open up at Fortnite and to what I believe anyway,

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.160
maybe, maybe naively so, but was a lot of very positive,

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.600
sort of like this is a really cool thing to see that Fortnite is doing

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.680
and able to show that.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.600
So I hope I hope folks

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:37.160
that have a little say and pull and looking at where they do

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.040
and they don't partner can take a look at things like that

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.640
and maybe the impact it's had and how it could be useful for something like this, too.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.520
Well, and see that some of the things that go in there,

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:52.720
I mean, there is some stuff that like is like right from Wikipedia.

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.560
But there's there's other things going on,

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.280
just like some of the lesser known tales of resistance,

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.080
you know, spotlighting aspects of the Dutch resistance, for example.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:12.440
You know, just very various, you know, different different things that are

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.480
the stories you don't hear every day.

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.880
You know what I mean? Right.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.080
And now, as far as his game, The Light in the Darkness,

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.720
it is available for free on Epic.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.120
I didn't check Steam yet.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.280
I found a completely different game with the same name,

01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.520
but it's on PS5.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:36.400
It's on different consoles and it is free.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.800
And he went from trying to tell like, you know,

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:47.600
oh, the little kid, unrealistic view to actually you are living this event

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.040
and it doesn't end well.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.680
You know, so sort of, you know,

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:59.360
this is the extreme end of what your harmful words can lead to.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.240
Don't repeat it.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.840
I really love this comment from QuestBuster in our chat over

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.360
twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.000
QuestBuster says, I always applaud efforts like this.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.320
The medium has always played to its strengths in creative ways

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:15.320
from Oregon Trail to titles like This War of Mine

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.600
to efforts like those in Assassin's Creed, Origin and Valhalla

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:23.480
as history walkabouts to perhaps inspire someone out there to simply ask,

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.400
hey, is there a way to know more?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:34.440
Yeah, I actually I've had the game on my my radar for a little bit.

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.640
As soon as I can figure out a good way to play it, I totally will.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.280
But I'm I'm pretty

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.280
I'm just excited that the Fortnite folks have gone along with this, too,

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.760
that they're they're in there to have some real education

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.520
going on in a silly game that has a llama for a mascot.

01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:01.920
You know, and and and I've I've had this discussion

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.800
actually with a coworker as far as, you know, talking about training material.

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:10.440
And there's a really good book out there called The Gamification of Training.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:17.080
But I look at the same thing as also training, education,

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:20.720
presenting things, because some people will learn better

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.000
by participating in a thing.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.560
And if you can offer this up in a virtual environment

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.760
and have someone participate with the game or with the content,

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:33.920
you know, having it in an interactable, you know, area

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.160
that I think that it cements those those stories in people's minds again

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.680
and keeps it in the the modern consciousness

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.160
before we lose the people who've who lived it.

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.760
Philanine in our chat says, I think it's cool,

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:53.440
but it's kind of like handing out copies of the Barbie movie

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:55.680
at an NRA convention.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.920
I understand disagree.

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.560
I understand the perspective to an extent.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:03.360
However, there's something to be said about

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.920
when they kind of strip out some of the multiplayer

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.360
and some of the essentially what leads to group think

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.520
and the reason why people behave like asshats online

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.120
is to, you know, try to get a rise, impress, do things with other people.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.680
When you kind of take the interactions with other people out of it

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:24.560
and in these particular experiences, even though they're in a multiplayer

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.000
environment, you are left with you

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.160
and the facts, the history, the exhibits, the evidence.

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.640
And you have the chance to have some self-reflection

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.680
with those sorts of things.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.240
Is that going to work with everybody?

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.920
Absolutely not.

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.200
But could it succeed in reaching through to a couple of people

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:47.360
and making them think differently when they're confronted with

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.880
the actual history and the evidence of what these sorts of things have led to?

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.400
It's worth trying.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.920
It's worth it's worth trying.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.040
You know what it takes, I think, to dismantle any kind of bigotry,

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:04.120
hatred like that, even casually.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:07.000
Mm hmm. Hey, that's not cool.

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.120
Mm hmm. One person saying, hey, that's not cool. That's right.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.000
Or I'd appreciate if you didn't say that around me. That's right.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:18.320
You know, it requires one person

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.560
to be brave enough to think for themselves.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.040
And tell their buddies, I don't appreciate it, and if they're their friends,

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.720
there's not going to be a problem.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.720
And, you know, and I'll even put it this way, and this might be

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.960
just my perspective from, you know, lots of different crap

01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.680
I personally live through, but.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.480
It it's easy to be the sheep.

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.440
It's harder to be the wolf.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:50.440
You know, also, now that I'm sitting here really thinking about it,

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:52.760
and again, I don't want to sound like I'm picking on the listener

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.240
because I completely understand where this comment comes from. I do.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.960
But it's it's when I when I look at the whole like it's handing out copies,

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.960
the Barbie movie at NRA convention.

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:04.240
Isn't the opposite true?

01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:07.360
Don't they? Isn't the opposite actively happening?

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.280
Because I was thinking about I was at the mall

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.440
and I was doing the whole Pokemon Go thing.

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.720
There was a little table set up of a certain religious affiliation

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.400
that was just sitting there waiting to answer any questions.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.120
And I you know, I got to think like they sit there all day with that damn table.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:25.240
Does anyone actually come up and talk to them like, hey, yes,

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:28.520
I'm interested in that religion that you go door to door pedaling anyway.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.480
They wouldn't do it if it didn't work at least once. Right.

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.960
And on top of that, on top of that, again, to continue this analogy,

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.280
as I was walking back to my car, I was walking, you know, past

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.800
like the Starbucks, the Macy's, I get stopped by this guy.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.640
And I'm not going to lie, he was an attractive younger.

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:49.240
When I say younger, I mean like mid 20s.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:50.440
Remember, I'm in my 40s now.

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.680
Younger and younger guy that was like, hey, you just like

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.440
I just felt like an energy from you.

01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.480
I just wanted to say hello to you.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:03.320
And I was like, and my honest to God, my my brain was like,

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:07.400
did did my fat thumb activate Grindr in this mall or something?

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.080
Like, why is this person like why is this person like randomly?

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.520
I'm not going to lie.

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:16.520
I'm fairly attractive Latino guy walking up to me, talking to me. Right.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.960
And cutie. Yeah.

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:21.720
But but then here's here's the punch line.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.480
And so I go, you know, because I'm kind of like deer in headlights.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.960
I'm like, thanks. Yeah.

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.400
Cool. What's up?

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.320
You know, type of thing.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:33.520
He's like, I just wanted to know, is there is there anything I can pray for you now?

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.400
Is it can I pray for you?

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.600
Yeah, there you go. There's the punch line, right?

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.840
Can I can I is there anything I can pray for you?

01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:42.320
And I don't know what I'm going to say. I'm gonna be honest.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.680
I don't know what it was about the moment, but I was like,

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:47.840
I didn't feel like being the guy that just wanted to say, like,

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:50.000
you know, roll my eyes and say fuck off and walk away.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.080
I didn't really want to do that.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:55.040
So I just said I said, I said, you know, if it'll if it'll make this

01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:00.800
mildly attractive man happy, I'm going to say, yes.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.200
You know what?

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.600
My my dad is actually having an investigative procedure right now.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.600
So if you want to keep him in your thoughts, I'd appreciate that. Right.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.840
I said that. And he said he said, I I will do that.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:13.400
He said, I'm going to do that for you.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.680
And I just want you to know God loves you.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.000
And I say I just kind of now and I'm really deer in the headlights.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.520
I smile because what am I supposed to say?

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.760
I think I'm supposed to say I love God, too, or whatever. I don't know.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.600
But I just said I said, oh, OK.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.000
And he goes, you know that, right? God loves you.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.560
And I just smiled and I looked at him dead in the eye and I said,

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.440
it's complicated. And I walked away.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.120
Yeah. How was it?

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.640
I take the approach outlined by Margaret

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.200
Tres mother and I apply it to many situations.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.400
Don't punch. Say thank you.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.360
Yeah. You know who else loves you?

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:53.360
Rob Starfish loves you.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:58.160
You know who loves me?

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.640
My cat when I'm feeding her.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:06.320
But I'm just can can we have more middle aged attractive men?

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.920
All right. Anyway, I guess

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:15.600
I'm just yes, I yes, I'm married.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.560
But, you know, we all like attention.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.960
All right. Moving on.

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:23.560
What do we have next?

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:26.160
I think we're over to Loki, right?

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:29.520
Yes. Yes. So this is eight strikes.

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.440
You're out because, you know, three, that's too little.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.240
Let's give you eight warnings before we kick you off the Xbox platform

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.760
for only a year.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.040
So they do.

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.200
Yeah. So basically now they have this new system.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.400
They were already doing these different enforcements before.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.720
But now if you get eight, there's they're kind of

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:58.560
drawing the equivalent to like the license system

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:01.760
like your driver's license, where if you get points on your driver's license,

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.040
then certain things happen like you certain restrictions.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.520
So, for example, you know, with the first point, you get a warning.

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:13.160
If you get three points, you're going to be, you know, off the platform

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.680
for, you know, seven days.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:19.160
You keep doing that, then you're going to be off for a year.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:24.120
And points will fall off of the person's record after six months.

01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.120
I think it's too much, though.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:29.000
I think that they should do it permanently.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.080
Honestly, DMV, Jesus, like, well, not the DMV, but like, yeah,

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.160
the rolling point window and all this.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.760
Well, yeah. So they say, you know what, you know what?

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:41.000
If you commit too many offenses on Xbox,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
you should have to go to the equivalent of traffic school.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.600
But for Xbox Live, you should have to go.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.320
Yeah, you have to go to etiquette school to comedy.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:53.480
Stop saying slurs on the Internet school.

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:55.200
That's that's what you need to do.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.360
Just like violating.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:58.360
Pretty funny. Too many.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.840
You're going to do the same thing that I do with traffic school,

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.080
and that's just test out.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.120
Yeah, so that's the thing that they have now.

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:12.080
Just, you know, honestly, I think the year is not long enough.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.000
I mean, if you're you're getting eight violations within six months,

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.440
electric, that's a you.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.600
That's a you problem.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.640
So like, you know, obviously.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.040
Well, you just change your behavior.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.880
Don't be like this.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.760
Oh, my God. This comment from SSJ 100, Matt,

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:33.240
maybe I'm not under maybe I'm not understanding it well,

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.160
but it kind of feels like a Wendy's pick a menu.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.280
I could say cheat three times and do hate speech twice before getting banned

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.680
or commit hate speech twice and do some harassment once.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.760
It just seems convoluted.

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.560
Why give someone another chance to do hate speech?

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.840
Why give a person another two or three times to hurt someone?

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.320
I get what they're trying to do, but I feel not every

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:01.160
every situation fits into a fancy sliding scale.

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:04.320
And I'm sorry to be laughing at this, you know, because these these situations

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:08.320
are not funny. Yeah, but yes, the Wendy's pick a menu of it all

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.080
and like trying to put these into like literal buckets of, you know,

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:15.320
how bad is the crime is kind of humorous.

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:17.560
You know, it's just the whole system is a little strange.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:21.280
I am thinking of one particular situation, though,

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:26.840
and that would be like what of, you know, children who,

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:29.640
you know, get a little bit more maturity over the course of a year.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.200
And maybe that's why they have the rolling window.

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.760
Yeah, perhaps.

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:41.200
I do think I'm thinking of I do think with any discipline system online,

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.640
there ought to be a valid appeal method, you know.

01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.600
And if the appeal method is

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:52.240
I went to to traffic school and test it out and learn better.

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.200
I know how to do that.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.840
Then, you know, I think somebody should be given another chance.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.000
But someone told me not to be in thinking.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.760
No one's ever told me that before.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.400
To quote Dwight's truth.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.160
That's a demerit. Three demerits.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.600
You'll receive a citation, five citations, and you're looking at a violation.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.160
Four of those.

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.680
And you'll receive a verbal warning.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.520
Keep it up. And you're looking at a written warning.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:15.480
Two of those.

01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:18.920
That'll land you in a world of hurt in the form of a disciplinary review

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:22.560
written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.120
Perfect. And on that note,

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:34.400
let's go back to a time when, you know, there was no there was no point system.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:37.160
If you fucked up, mom took the cord to your system.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.360
That's what happens.

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:39.960
Let's go to the next segment.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.320
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.800
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.880
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.920
And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.480
I teethed this earlier.

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.560
I picked Nightmare in the Dark.

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:14.320
So Nightmare in the Dark is a platform

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.360
arcade game that was developed by AM factory.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.960
You know what, I'm stupid because I picked a game.

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.480
Never mind, I'm not stupid.

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.960
I take that back.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.000
It came out in 2000.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.800
And for just a moment, my brain rewinded itself in time and was like,

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.840
that wasn't yeah, it was more than 10 years ago.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.280
So anyway, it was developed by AM factory.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:41.040
Also assisted by PALN and it was released by Eleven

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:45.280
slash Gather King on January 27th, 2000,

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.200
except it wasn't actually released.

01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:51.520
It never got an official release for either the Neo Geo AES,

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.880
the home version or Neo Geo CD platforms.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:00.600
It's the story of a gravekeeper

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:03.360
who finds that his graves are being desecrated

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:06.040
and he's trying to stop the grave robbers.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.160
So this game.

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.440
Actually, I take that back.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:17.720
It did get released on Neo Geo MVS, but there was no home release.

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.160
I mean, which is stupid because if it was MVS,

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.640
it would have been easy to do AES.

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:23.080
But anyway, anyway.

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.880
So basically, it's it's Bubble Bobble

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.120
slash Snow Brothers, the goth version.

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.080
So you play the little gravekeeper

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.320
and you have to

01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.520
go around and and throw fire from your lantern

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:42.920
at these different enemies and eventually turn them

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.720
into a big ball of fire that you can throw at enemies.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.360
Basically, you have to have the biggest balls of them all.

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:54.200
And of course, they roll through the level and destroy things

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.560
and you get goodies for everything your big balls destroy.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.200
And then they release.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.080
Yeah, that power at the moment that they're destroyed.

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.320
But unlike in Snow Brothers, you don't get all beneficial items.

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.800
You'll get some detrimental ones,

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.840
like things that strip away your powers and stuff like that.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.200
And then at the end of the fourth level, you have a boss fight.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:25.200
And then you get these big bursts of of items released by the boss.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:31.920
One of them is it looks like meat on the bone, and that is an extra life.

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.760
It only comes out with the the defeat of the boss.

01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.440
But at any rate,

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.960
it's a fun game, it gets pretty challenging,

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:50.360
but I like the aesthetic of it, honestly, I found it

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.720
to be a lot more fun than Snow Brothers or Bubble Bobble

01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.280
because it's cute, but scary.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:04.200
So there's an official story that you see at the start of the game,

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.040
and I want to I want to read it, if no one minds.

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.840
Go for it. There lived one grave watcher

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:16.760
with magical power at a very small village in a remote region.

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:21.000
He lived a quiet, solitary life in the corner of the cemetery.

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:25.280
He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance.

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:28.280
Well, the village people are stupid, I'm kidding.

01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.240
One day he found the graves were being ransacked and some corpses were stolen.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.520
He didn't want the village people to find out,

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.960
so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:42.760
Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.200
He found out that a powerful wizard has been stealing the corpses

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:50.280
to build his army of undead to terrorize the village.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.640
He then took it upon himself to eliminate the wizard once and for all.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.480
And then there's one more line that I think is from the end of the game.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:03.520
After defeating the wizard, he returns to his solitary life.

01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:06.440
Eventually, the villagers find out about his bravery

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.560
and protecting them from the menace of the wizard

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:11.960
and go to his house and express their gratitude to him.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.960
And and actually, funny enough, this year,

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.880
Time Extension said that this was one of the best games ever for the Neo Geo.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.120
There you go.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.520
All right. It's a cute game.

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:34.240
I love it. It's got a cute style to it.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:37.760
I like the whole like Halloween, Halloween, Snow Brothers type of thing.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:41.720
Oh, yeah. That second boss, though,

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.440
it's like a giant skull on like built into a motorcycle. Mm hmm.

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.920
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.760
It's just that that one was a pain in the ass.

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:55.480
The other ones were like a cakewalk compared to that one, even the twin ones.

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.920
And I played a significant amount of this

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.080
on one of the candy cabs at California Extreme yesterday.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.720
All right. Your classic game of the week, Nightmare in the Dark.

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.320
Let me just say, Dark Soccer, I appreciate you picking a Halloween game in August.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:13.880
I really do, especially with the rumor that pumpkin spice lattes

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:18.120
are returning next week and fall is creeping back more and more and more.

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:20.520
And I, for one, could not be happier because you know what?

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:23.960
Christmas has been cutting into the Halloween season for far too long.

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.360
So you know what? Summer Halloween deserves this moment.

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:30.040
Suck it. It is now fall. Yeah.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.280
And honestly, though, I'm just

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:37.200
at the grocery store.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:41.160
The Starbucks brand already has their Keurig

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.280
pumpkin spice.

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:48.640
I posted an Instagram story this week as we were at Target

01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.600
and I saw my first pumpkin spice.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:51.320
It was the same thing.

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:53.440
It was their store brand.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.520
I can't remember the name of it, but Target's in store brand

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:59.520
of the pumpkin spice decaf and gather actually good and gather

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:00.360
whatever it's called.

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:02.240
Good and plenty like the candy.

01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:04.840
The pumpkin spice decaf as well.

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.440
So, oh, I don't usually see the fun flavors and decaf.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.640
So had to get some of those.

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:13.280
So now DJ says fall is not until September 22nd.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:15.040
Stay in your lane, Rob.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.320
To that, I say suck it.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.320
Hater, is this is the spirit store open or not open?

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:21.880
The spirits that go check.

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:27.160
Oh, not go check your local abandoned former department store.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.680
No, we've got one right around the corner from us.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:31.560
But they're not open yet.

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.680
They have the signs out.

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:33.960
I need to check.

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.960
So I need to check where the where the sports chalet was,

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.640
because that's where our spirit is out here by Joanne's,

01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:44.600
which is funny to have the spirit and Joanne next to each other,

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.160
because then I can just like be everywhere I need and stock up

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:51.240
on future cosplay stuff and decorations for my house year round.

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.280
Alan and I are trying to figure out what we want to dress up as well.

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.040
We know what we want to dress up as for ugly.

01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.440
But we want to figure out, like, should we just do the costumes in a bag

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.120
or like, how can we make it more interesting?

01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:04.400
So it can be something that reminds me.

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.280
I've decided what my second cosplay is going to be for TwitchCon.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.000
Hmm. Pigmeg.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.320
Oh, pigmeg. How funny. My Meg.

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.680
You know, it's funny.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:17.720
Intoxicated and I use exactly the same cosmetic for our megs.

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.720
Independently of each other.

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.000
That's funny. Are they coming again to TwitchCon?

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:26.240
Yeah. Fine. Yeah.

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.280
I'm not even sure.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:29.560
I'm not even sure who's going to tell this year.

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.680
Oh, I know. I know.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:35.520
I haven't heard of Elsie's going, which I really hope so.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:39.240
But I think in a while, I think they've went on a break.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.840
Yeah. Yeah. But I think,

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.080
well, he's living his best vtuber life.

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.360
But I know Nick is going.

01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.640
Cam is going.

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.960
I think we're going to have Le Pen.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:55.960
I think we're going to have has like your usual.

01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.240
I think we're going to have like all the usuals.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.880
But I think there's a few people who still aren't going to be able to make it,

01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.160
because I think that that Rokum's isn't going to make it.

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:06.000
So I'm a little sad.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.600
I think the Vegas hotel prices are a little off putting

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.280
for some part of the problem.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.920
Yeah, I'm staying with Tiara.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.240
We oh, that'll be fun.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:17.000
I hope to see them at some point.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.120
Actually, we need to like do a dinner or something.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.880
We'll be there the day before and leave the day after.

01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:22.960
I'd love to see Tiara.

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:23.720
I'll bring it up.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.680
Yeah, we had some we had some plans to go like

01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:29.240
go to the Pinball Museum.

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:31.440
So oh, fuck yeah.

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.480
Heck yeah.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:37.440
Uh, God, Alan said he maybe wants to go see the RuPaul's Drag Race show again.

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:38.280
And I was like, really?

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.960
It wasn't that good the first time.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:44.200
But I'll do I'll do things my husband wants to do because I'm nice.

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.320
Well, I wanted to what I wanted to do that I was down.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.520
I tried to get us reservations

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.840
at the Hell Kitchen restaurant for Thursday when we get in.

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.520
And nope, if I wanted to if we wanted a reservation there,

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.360
it had to be like 11 o'clock at night.

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.200
Jeez. Yeah.

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:00.200
Phil of nine in chat says, was it bad, Rob?

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.280
I still need to see that.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.000
Honestly, just go see the local queens at a show like it.

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.200
It's just it's better and more organic.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.480
I didn't like the whole like overproducedness of it.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.960
And I thought it was if if you like the musicals on Drag Race, you'll like it.

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:19.400
If you think the musicals on Drag Race are ridiculous competitions,

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.840
then like me, you're not going to like it.

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:24.680
So it's your taste may vary. Hmm.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.840
Uh, Tara said definitely.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:29.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:31.800
I was interacting with him on Blue Sky and kind of hinted at it.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.280
So Phil of nine says I might go see the Drag Race show

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:36.120
when I go see the Kylie residency.

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.120
Kylie?

01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:39.920
Yeah, Kylie's doing a residency at the Venetian.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.080
Not not in October, but well, maybe, but not that weekend.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.120
I want to go so bad.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.920
But, you know, it's sold out like 30 minutes.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.640
But the rumor is she's going to add more dates

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:51.960
in the middle of next year.

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:54.640
And I might do it if they add more more dates.

01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:56.200
I might. But yeah. Oh, my God.

01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.640
They they are fucking fleecing the gays for that Kylie thing

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:03.920
because it's like the tickets for the show and then like the

01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:06.520
the dinner tickets and the minimum drink tickets.

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.560
It's like, oh, my God.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:11.600
No, I feel at night I heard they were going to add more on top of that.

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.520
So we'll see like.

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:17.440
I love Kylie. I know me, too.

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.960
I'd love to go see it, but I just. Yeah.

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:23.200
Anyway, I had actually kind of an embarrassing moment

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.080
yesterday at the convention because I was I was, you know,

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:32.240
touching up my makeup and I love it was on in the background music.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:34.600
And I'm singing along doing my face.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.520
And this lady looks over is like, you love this song, don't you?

01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.560
I was like, it's Kylie.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:41.400
Of course, I love this song. That was it.

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.720
That was a conversation.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.880
Every every time my friend and I go to because one of my friends

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.800
I play Overwatch with actually here locally, I will go out to the bar.

01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.720
We like to go to the bolt sometimes.

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.680
And every time because he drinks, he taught me how to install

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.120
the touch to these on my phone.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:03.840
So when we go, I always say, OK, I'm going to put them on.

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:08.080
So and usually after like three hours,

01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:11.640
it will finally come on because gays and controlling music.

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.440
Let me tell you. Mm hmm.

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.040
All right. You know, whether that's still not even my favorite Kylie song.

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.880
No, it's not my favorite either, but it's it's so like

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:23.280
it's a song that is still my favorite.

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.360
You can't help but smile.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.360
Yeah. That's the thing. And drive really fast, too. Oops.

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:30.960
Maybe I'm just like super contemporary,

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:33.560
but I really think my favorite Kylie song is Say Something.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.920
I love that song.

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:37.440
Like it just it always lifts up my mood.

01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:40.840
It has such a such a lovely musical melody to it.

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:41.960
And the harmonies are beautiful.

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:42.960
Anyway, I get it.

01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:45.360
Anyway, next on Kylie Lounge Radio.

01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:49.720
It sets off my synesthesia in a good way. Yes. All right.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.880
KylieCon. Yes.

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:58.520
In Australia, unfortunately. All right.

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:02.520
Moving on, let's talk about some other news in the gaming industry

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:04.720
with some rapid fire news.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:07.000
Loki. Yep.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.520
So Steam Remote Play is getting an upgrade.

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:13.720
They're going to be enabling for case streaming now.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.240
So that's pretty sweet.

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:19.320
I just grabbed the beta client of Steam to be able to try that out.

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.480
Neat. I haven't done remote play.

01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:27.400
I have a like one of those

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:28.480
that's what they call it.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:31.880
It's not Steam Deck, Steam Box, Steam streaming thing.

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.680
I don't know. I haven't tried that ever since they got it, but

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.120
that might be fun.

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:41.480
We'll see. And then there's a rumor, of course, that Keanu Reeves

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:42.880
is in Death Stranding 2.

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.280
This is coming from Instagram where Hideo Kojima posted a picture of

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:51.280
none other than Norman Reedus sitting next to Keanu Reeves.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:55.680
And well, why would they be together and Hideo Kojima posting about it?

01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:59.640
Maybe we'll have to find out, I guess.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:04.120
That sounds like a Game Awards type of an announcement.

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.600
Doesn't it? Doesn't it sound like the type of thing that was arranged

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.120
backstage at the Game Awards? Like totally does.

01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:14.320
Yeah, that that totally sounds like a thing that we'll see in a few months.

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:18.160
All right. Darsakra.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:22.240
Well, Alan Wake News, Alan Wake 2

01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:25.880
has been delayed by ten days.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.560
Ten whole days. Ten whole days.

01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:31.840
More like Alan Wait.

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.800
It will be out on October 27th.

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:40.840
And it's not really related to like giving them time to to, you know,

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:46.200
polish up the date as I think it's just the quote is saying.

01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.760
That we hope this date shift gives more space

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.880
for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.320
So meaning I think it's going to be to allow a buffer time

01:48:56.320 --> 01:49:00.640
between the majority of releases to then bring out their game.

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:04.760
I think what

01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:06.240
isn't that around?

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.440
Call it at ease, I think, coming out in November, unless they bumped it up

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:12.280
earlier, but there is some big games in October.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.800
Yeah, it's just like Assassin's Creed or something like that.

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:16.080
Yeah, Assassin's Creed is.

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.280
Well, I mean, I should probably just look at the list.

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.680
It's right in front of me anyway. So that's true.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:22.680
We are about to move into release dates.

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.160
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.480
Only a few things coming out in the 20th.

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:29.080
So Marvel's Spider-Man, too, and Super Mario Wonder.

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.840
Just a couple of small games, you know, like it's it's no big deal.

01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.440
It's no big deal.

01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.240
The Metal Gear Solid remaster.

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:38.120
All right. All right. All right.

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:41.160
But if I can finish. Sure. Please.

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.120
I know we already derailed it with Kylie, we could just talk about more Kylie.

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:47.680
Finish your damn story.

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:52.760
But the tweet from their official Twitter account,

01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:54.840
I'm not calling it anything but Twitter.

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.920
An update from the Alan Wake 2 team.

01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:00.520
We're moving Alan Wake 2's launch from October 17th to October 27th.

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.560
October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift.

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:05.720
And here's the rest of the quote.

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:08.200
Gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:12.080
We can't wait to show you what everyone's favorite novelist is up to

01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:13.960
in the dark place next week.

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:16.280
Thanks for your patience.

01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.320
So there's going to be more news coming out.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.480
I'll put a link to the tweet in the in the chat tweet.

01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:24.480
All right. Tweet. Not.

01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:27.720
Yeah, not anything else. All right.

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:30.280
No, I didn't hear anything. No one said anything.

01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.560
Moving on to this story.

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:35.680
Jeff Keeley is basically saying in regards to opening night

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:39.720
live at Gamescom, lower your expectations.

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:43.080
I'm paraphrasing, but that's what I'm hearing in this whole thing is that

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.880
do not expect gigantic game announcements in this whole thing.

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:48.040
But maybe it's a mind trick.

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:50.560
Maybe he's saying that because there's going to be a big announcement.

01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:51.680
OK, I don't think so.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.760
Just, you know, lower the bar.

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:55.440
Here's what he is saying.

01:50:55.440 --> 01:51:00.560
And this is only like two days away, actually, because it's opening night live.

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:01.840
But it's like 11 a.m.

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.800
for us, because obviously it's happening in Germany.

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:06.040
So time zones, lol.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:09.840
But the event is happening on August 22nd.

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:12.440
And in a statement, actually, no, I'm sorry.

01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.840
This was an interview with VGC.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.760
Jeff Keeley said it's going to be an exciting show with new looks

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:23.240
at many announced upcoming games like Alan Wake 2 and Black Myth Wukong.

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:28.160
This year's ONL is less about announcing brand new projects

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:32.520
and more about giving fans updates on some of the biggest games

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.720
due out over the next year.

01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.880
Haven't I given you nerds enough?

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:40.200
No, I added that last line myself, but I just I just

01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:42.680
he should have said that.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:45.120
Jeff, if you're highly hiring a publicist, I'm available.

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:50.800
Just saying. Anyhow, the last time I think they actually had.

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.640
Oh, the last one was in person.

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:54.600
So this one will also be in person.

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:56.720
But obviously there was there was a break there.

01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:00.400
Last year's show was two hours and ran 35 games.

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.240
But I don't know.

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:04.360
They're not saying exactly how long this one is,

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.160
but I'm sure folks will be paying attention on Tuesday morning.

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:11.600
So we'll see if anything new maybe does get gets announced.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.360
We'll see.

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.840
Dark Tetsuya says, I mean, I'll just be happy to get the Phantom Liberty update.

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.720
Quest Buster says, Can't wait for Phantom Liberty.

01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:22.080
S2 100 Matt says, Here comes the Where are the new games?

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:24.480
Worst Gamescom ever.

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.360
Again, like you have Baldur's Gate three nerds.

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.160
What else do you fucking want this year?

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.400
Like go like literally on top of everything else.

01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:37.240
Everything else you've been given this year.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:39.720
You now have Baldur's Gate three.

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:41.880
Go fucking play something that already came out.

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.720
I mean, Starfield's coming out in a few weeks.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:48.160
I know the early access is happening on the Dragon Con,

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:51.080
which I'm not paying for early access, but it's weird to me to think

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:54.880
when I get back from Dragon Con, which I leave for in 10 days, BT dubs,

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:57.760
when I get back from Dragon Con, there will be Starfield to play.

01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:01.880
For real, finally, it's amazing.

01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:05.760
Anyway, let's travel around the world

01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:08.280
and check out some games that are coming out

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.640
a little sooner than October 20th as in the next week.

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.640
Loki, what's coming out in the US?

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:17.560
We have Fort Solace on PC, Mac and PlayStation five.

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:23.040
Immortals of Avium on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.440

Smurfs Kart on PC, PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one, Xbox series.

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:35.240
Now's the time to cash in on, you know, the Smurfs license.

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:38.800
Well, after any movies or anything has been never done

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:42.280
for the Smurfs, now is the time.

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:45.880
Wrestle Quest coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation

01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:50.360

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:58.760

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:01.280
EPO three plus story.

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.600
That is a mouthful. Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.000

PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:33.080
All right. Traveling over to Japan and looking at some releases there,

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.040
you know, we had a pretty quiet week last week

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:37.720
and in contrast, we have a very busy week this week.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.720
So coming out on the switch this week, on the 24th, we have DC

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:45.840
three to Capo three plus story in regular and limited edition.

01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:49.880
Shirogane Cross Spirits, also in regular and limited edition.

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:54.600
Caru Maruka Circle in regular and limited edition.

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:57.960
Killer Frequency in a multi language

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.480
supported edition comes out in Japan this week.

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:05.360
We have the Kemco RPG Selection volume four releases for the switch.

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:09.960
These come out pretty regularly with some, you know, more obscure

01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:12.640
to the audiences over here anyway, releases.

01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:16.200
But if you're curious, the releases in this collection are Cronus

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:21.840
Ark, Bonds of the Skies, Legends of the Tetrarchs and Monochrome Order.

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:25.160
So those are what are in the Kemco RPG Selection four.

01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:29.640
Coffee Talk one and two gets a double pack release as well.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.360
Tiny Troopers Global Ops, excuse me, and Unreal Life in a regular

01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:38.320
and limited edition also comes out.

01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.000
That's all on the Nintendo Switch.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:43.400
If you want to go over to the PlayStation five, you can check out

01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:48.600
Immortals of Avium is out as well as that Killer Frequency game is out as well.

01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:51.600
Ride five is also out in Japan.

01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:57.440
Tiny Troopers Global Ops and Fantavision 2020X

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:00.320
is out as well in Japan this week.

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:03.440
That's I'm assuming the VR game.

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:07.000
I didn't realize Japan did not get it at the same time as the rest of us.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.560
But there you go. That is coming out.

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:11.640
It's actually really low price, too.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:14.640
It's about a twenty dollar game in Japan.

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:17.320
So it seems kind of low, but cool.

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:19.360
So check that out.

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:23.080
Me, it doesn't say anything about it being a price reduction, but

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.560
interesting. All right.

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:29.000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.040
A handful of things on PlayStation 20,

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:36.960
but on the 22nd on PlayStation, we have Smurfs Kart

01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:39.480
for PlayStation, Xbox.

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.880
We have Immortals of Avium on the 24th.

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:44.240
Oh, it's a card game.

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:46.960
Never mind. It's just Yu-Gi-Oh block set.

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.720
Twenty fourth.

01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:52.360
We have PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Blasphemous two

01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:55.880
on PlayStation, Xbox, Ride five

01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:58.360
on the twenty fifth.

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.560
We have Hitman World of Assassination on PlayStation

01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:06.080
PlayStation, also Metal Tails Overkill

01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.360
PlayStation and Switch Armored Core six

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:14.400
and on Switch Loop Hero.

01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.600
All right. Well, we have some more news stories for you.

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:21.240
But before we get to those, DarkSakura, I believe at this point,

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:23.400
you are going to be bidding us adieu tonight.

01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:27.000
You talked about some of your professional engagements earlier in the show.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
So I think you are heading out early tonight. Yeah, I got to.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.200
You know, it's it's work.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.560
I have to be up at five in the morning and I got some stuff to do before bed.

01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:38.040
So. All right.

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:40.280
Hey, it's money pays the bills.

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.920
But keep your eyes open in the meantime.

01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:46.680
Peace and love.

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:49.280
All right. And no, no stream tonight, but we will look forward

01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:52.800
to seeing you back here next week, right here on Tuesday for streaming.

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:54.720
Yeah, then I'll be, of course back.

01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:56.520
Yes. All right. Have a good one.

01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:58.760
I do. All right.

01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.320
Let's move on with the news.

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:02.520
Loki, what do you have for us next?

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:08.400
All right. So we talked about this before, that there was some sort of deal

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:12.040
that fell through with Embracer Group, basically a two billion dollar deal.

01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.560
Very large.

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:17.040
The initial assumption was, oh, this must be Sony or Microsoft

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:19.400
investing in the company will come to find out.

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:23.680
According to four anonymous sources that spoke with Axios,

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.320
it's actually this Saudi public investment fund gaming

01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.320
subsidiary of Savvy Games Group that backed out.

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.800
So. I mean.

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.360
There's a whole like conflict with me, like with the Saudis

01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:43.440
investing in gaming anyways, because of the whole, you know, way they

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.200
you know, at least their government is treating like journalists,

01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:49.160
you know, murdering them,

01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:52.360
probably not favorable and, you know, kind of like,

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:57.000
oh, hey, let's invest in these games and stuff to make our image look better.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.800
Like, you know, I, I don't like the way that looks.

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.400
So maybe that's why it fell through. Who knows?

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.800
But, you know, they've already received one billion dollar investment

01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:12.840
from this investment fund, apparently already from last year.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:16.920
So they're just not receiving an additional two billion dollars.

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.800
All right. Yeah, I am.

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:25.440
This news is interesting about who left him at the altar.

01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:30.080
But yeah, I can't say I disagree, Loki, that maybe

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.960
some of these countries are already a little too invested in gaming.

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.080
I can't say I'm

01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:37.800
disappointed to hear that they're not going to have their,

01:59:38.240 --> 01:59:40.920
you know, be wedged in a little more.

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:45.920
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the idea of them investing in other things

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:50.120
is part of part the image and part trying to not have all of their money

01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:53.640
invested in oil in a world that's trying to get away from oil.

01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:55.720
It's both. Yeah.

01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:58.480
But obviously there's still some human rights issues

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:00.760
and so forth that are of a concern.

02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:06.520
So I can't say I'm, again, sad to see them not investing.

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.440
But I know the industry, you know, and what embrace is going through

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:11.320
is a shitty thing to do to embrace her.

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.480
So I'm kind of curious what all happened there.

02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:15.000
Maybe they'll make a movie about it someday.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.200
Who knows? Maybe. Maybe.

02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:18.760
What else do you have, Loki?

02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:22.560
So kind of counter to what we're a little bit more in line

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.280
with what we expect from Take-Two normally.

02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:27.640
We talked last week about how some of the roleplay mods and stuff

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:32.120
have been brought into and purchased by Take-Two Interactive

02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:36.200
to kind of help support Grand Theft Auto online.

02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:41.280
Well, now they're just back to the usual game of striking down modders,

02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:44.000
creating mods for Grand Theft Auto five.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.760
So this one in particular is actually an AI mod

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:50.600
using Eleven Labs voice technology as well.

02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:56.240
It allows, I guess, for more custom AI.

02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:00.200
I don't know if it's NPCs or other players, but,

02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.680
you know, basically a sentient street mods, which they said

02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:10.920
had a story that revolved around AI worshipping death cult and NPCs

02:01:11.240 --> 02:01:14.800
whose dialogue would be randomly generated by a tool called

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:16.640
in world character engine.

02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:19.520
I mean, it sounds really cool,

02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:24.040
but it's also not unexpected that Rockstar Games would do this.

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:26.960
You know, hey, innovation, we can't have that.

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:29.560
Let's just strike that down because you're using our game.

02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:32.200
Yeah. Well, also just make your own game.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:34.080
How is this? You know, how is it?

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.560
And we've talked a little bit before about this when it comes to AI.

02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:38.280
How is the AI learning?

02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.840
You know, because if it's learning from something,

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.040
right, given permission to use, then, well,

02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:45.960
it's probably learning from just the language models that they already have.

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:46.840
So it's it.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:48.960
I don't think it's learning necessarily from this.

02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:51.800
It's probably not incorporating anything from Grand Theft Auto

02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.960
into how the language is generated, though.

02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:56.480
No, I don't think so. Hmm.

02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:59.560
Interesting. All right.

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.800
Well, something kind of lastly here tonight

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:06.840
before we get to our listener roundtable, something that is a little

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:10.440
again, it's one of those things that they probably don't have permission to do it.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:13.560
But I'm not I'm not so sure they're going to get shut down for this.

02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.400
This is a Twin Peaks.

02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:18.720
You know, I love this show, by the way.

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:21.440
If you've never seen this show, it's an incredible TV show.

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:23.880
It's a little bit dated. It's from the 90s.

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:27.560
But Twin Peaks was a show that premiered in 1990.

02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:30.480
If you've ever heard the whole famous like Who Killed Laura Palmer thing,

02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:33.040
that is all from the show Twin Peaks.

02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:38.680
And this group, the Blue Rose team, it is a French developer,

02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:45.280
just released a demo this week for something called Twin Peaks into the night.

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:49.160
They've been prepping this for a little bit now, and a demo just came out.

02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:52.640
And you can see here from the video that we're looking at on Twitch TV,

02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:55.320
or if you go look that up here because you're listening on the podcast,

02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:59.840
the graphics are very retro and they're very PlayStation one,

02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:02.080
which, you know, makes sense for the time frame of the game.

02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:05.240
Although actually in 1990, it would have been like Super Nintendo,

02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.440
like maybe a 32 X game.

02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:10.520
But that's OK, because, you know, the movie then came later and all that stuff.

02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:14.680
But I love the look of this for, you know, what this is.

02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:18.120
I love how they've recreated some of the imagery

02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:22.280
from the iconic TV show into this whole thing here.

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:27.840
In the game, the game kind of looks like a little bit of a game

02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:29.160
in the game.

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.320
Yeah, the game kind of has like this Resident Evil sort of look to it

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:33.240
that looks really good.

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:35.280
It kind of fits right in with that whole thing.

02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:38.160
Oh, God, I love this whole thing of that whole scene of

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:40.760
Julie Cruz singing at the bar. But anyway,

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:47.240
there looks to be some actual video cut scenes from the show itself.

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:53.120
The demo has to do with events from season one where Cooper arrives in Twin Peaks

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:56.840
and starts looking into the murder case of Laura Palmer.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.360
And of course, the demo has all the quirky things

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.200
and the scary things that people loved from the TV show.

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.880
The game, of course, will be free when it launches,

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:08.280
because they're trying to avoid any legal issues.

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.120
David Lynch, they're just kind of hoping is too busy doing his,

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:18.120
you know, it's Friday social media posts and whatever weather reports

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:20.040
he does on YouTube or whatever he's doing these days.

02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:22.840
So hopefully he won't cause a stink.

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:26.320
ABC, which is technically Disney,

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:28.640
don't know how they're going to take to this,

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:32.240
but let's just kind of hope it kind of goes under their radar, shall we say?

02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:35.760
Anyway, I think this thing looks so cool, I got to say.

02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:42.200
It does not get into the elements of the recent Twin Peaks,

02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:45.960
The Return, which was on Showtime a few years ago,

02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:49.240
which was the, quote unquote, third season, which was also very good.

02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:52.160
But this game touches none of that.

02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:54.560
I suppose they have to save something for a potential sequel, right?

02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:57.800
Who knows? Anyway.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:04.160
That is it for all the stories that we had slotted tonight.

02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:06.800
Comments in chat, Sjo and Hunter Matt says,

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:08.920
So Rob is streaming this when?

02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:10.040
I'm tempted to.

02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:12.040
Let's let them give it a little more polish

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:14.280
and then I'll probably have to stream it,

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.360
because they only have the demo right now.

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:19.880
So I would like to see maybe a full game if they if they even get there.

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:22.280
But maybe I could do the demo. We'll see.

02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:24.640
Tiger class says a Twin Peaks video game could work

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:27.440
because of all the detective type things you could do to find clues and such.

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:30.600
It is interesting. We never got anything like that.

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:33.520
But again, the TV show is from like 1990.

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:37.680
So even though you're seeing it in a PlayStation one era game,

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:42.240
which would be like 96, it's it's still a little dated.

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.400
Bobby says you could play the demo and describe the references

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:47.120
for people who'd ever watched the TV show.

02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:49.600
Well, maybe that would be a fun little VOG Network video at some point.

02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:51.440
We'll see. Who knows?

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:54.640
So dark to see, it says someone got a C and D

02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:58.160
copyright thing for streaming a 25 year old soap opera.

02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.680
You can't even buy on DVD legally anymore.

02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.560
So you never know. That's that's true.

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:05.080
You never know what they're going to police and what they're not.

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:07.040
Let's go to you all.

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:09.920
If you have any questions in our chat room for us, we're happy to happy.

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:13.360
Happy to answer those over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:17.360
The phone lines are open as well over on our Discord server, VOG Network

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.960
dot com slash discord.

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:21.520
And this is the part of the show where we would open up our mailbag.

02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:25.080
Participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to email us.

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:27.840
If you have a question or thoughts as you listen throughout the week,

02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:31.760
especially those of you that are only listening through the podcast

02:06:31.760 --> 02:06:34.440
and aren't able to join us live on Sunday nights for whatever reason,

02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.840
totally understand that.

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:37.000
Send us an email sometime.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.280
Participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

02:06:39.280 --> 02:06:40.920
Dark Soccer has already left the building,

02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:43.840
so I will be taking her role tonight and reading the emails.

02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:47.360
But my job is very, very easy as there were no emails in the bag tonight.

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:50.960
So I hope we can get some next week over at participate at Orange

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:55.360
Lounge Radio dot com while we wait to see if there's any questions

02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:57.600
or other roundtable topics for us.

02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.640
Loki, I don't know if there's any last minute news tonight

02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.320
or last minute stories, but I'll check.

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.400
No, not a thing.

02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.440
I think so. I think so.

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:06.840
It's been I feel like it actually has been a little bit.

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:08.840
I mean, we've had some big stories we've talked about,

02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:11.920
but I feel like otherwise it's a little bit slower paced than usual.

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.960
And then I remembered, oh, games comes next week.

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:18.640
So some folks are holding, even though Jeff Keighley is saying,

02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:23.080
don't watch the expectation level, manage them expectations.

02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.560
That doesn't mean we won't get a few big things out of it.

02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:29.280
I'm hoping we get some updates from Konami on the Silent Hill

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.600
stuff that they showed earlier this year.

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:32.760
Like there's a lot.

02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:37.760
What their Silent Hill F, Silent Hill 2 remake, Silent Hill Ascension.

02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:39.600
There's all these Silent Hill things they announced

02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.600
and we don't have a release date for anything yet.

02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:44.120
So I'm hoping we find out that maybe one of those projects

02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:45.800
is coming out this year.

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:48.880
Fun random aside.

02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:51.520
You know, we love our Dead by Daylight here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:55.560
Silent Hill kind of got their cosmetics refreshed

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:59.720
and technically a new character from Silent Hill is now in the game.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:03.040
It's a it's a skin replacement, basically.

02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:06.160
So kind of like how in Resident Evil, you can replace Leon

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:08.720
with Chris or Carlos. Well.

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.200
Cheryl, why did her name escape me from there?

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.640
Cheryl, you could replace with a lot of different characters.

02:08:13.640 --> 02:08:16.200
This is what you could do. Lisa Garland, you can do James.

02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:18.840
And now as of this week, you can be Maria.

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:20.760
Maria was added to the game this week.

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:25.320
So I thought that would be timed a little more with maybe some news

02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:27.520
on the Silent Hill 2 remake, but whatever.

02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:29.720
Maybe that's coming this week. I don't know.

02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:32.520
Maybe they had to do it this week because the alien contents come in soon.

02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.840
I don't know. So we'll see.

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:36.720
Yeah, Dartusi and James.

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:41.160
Yeah, Dartusi in chat says, I mean, our holiday is already stacked

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:44.440
even without anything new potentially out of Gamescom. True.

02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:46.400
I mean, I thought maybe they would announce some stuff

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:49.440
for like the first part of next year, maybe. But.

02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:52.600
It's too soon, and there's all those rumors

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:55.240
that Nintendo is going to make a move in the early part of next year,

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:57.560
so we'll see. We'll see.

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:01.520
All right. Well, Loki, anything else you want to talk about

02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:03.720
before we head on out tonight?

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.640
No, I don't really have anything else other than

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:09.400
like I said, I'm going to be streaming this week, you know,

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:12.800
try to get as much streaming as I can in there.

02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:15.560
So, you know, look for that if you want to see stuff.

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.920
What's on the screen behind me right now is Ace Race.

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:20.720
That's the one that's like Mario Kart.

02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:22.920
OK, it's a lot. It's a lot of fun to play.

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:26.200
Like it really is. It's a movement so fast. Yeah.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:29.280
So, yeah, that'll be something cool.

02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:33.720
Hopefully they bring Ace Race to MCC Island soon because that's free

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:36.160
and it's kind of cool with like if it is MCC,

02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:39.000
something you want to check out as you see islands completely free.

02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:43.000
There's you just search it online and you can play in a lot

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:43.960
of the different games.

02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:46.560
They have twists on what's actually in MCC.

02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:49.280
It's actually harder in MCC Island.

02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:53.000
How hard would it be for a Minecraft noob or, you know,

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:56.920
dirty casual like me to sign in and play one of these games?

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:00.320
Well, for MCC Island, completely easy.

02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:03.240
You just set up your Minecraft client to connect to it.

02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:06.760
They even have like an installer or like a mod list

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:09.240
that they'd recommend for like performance stuff.

02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:11.000
But you don't necessarily need to do that.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.880
Wow. It's just connecting to the server.

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:17.600
And then you can play in a bunch of the different games that they have there.

02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:20.960
And you get like coins and stuff and you like skins and stuff

02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:22.440
that you can unlock. So it's pretty cool.

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:26.240
Does Microsoft recognize any of this stuff with as big of a deal as it is,

02:10:26.240 --> 02:10:28.120
or is it really just community grown?

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.040
This one's all community grown.

02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:31.800
So it's all independent.

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.840
All right. Well, good luck to you.

02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:34.280
We'll be watching.

02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:36.000
Yeah, they're not going to recognize about some builds.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.520
They're definitely not going to recognize this.

02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.480
I mean, maybe they would.

02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:41.080
I mean, this is so to go back to MCC again.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:44.680
So MCC is literally something that the biggest,

02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:48.760
absolute biggest content creators in the Minecraft space participate in.

02:10:48.760 --> 02:10:52.160
Dream, you have all the hermit, you know, a lot of the hermit craft people,

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.920
a lot of the Empire's people.

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:57.400
You have all of the people on the Dream S&P type stuff.

02:10:58.080 --> 02:11:00.640
Technoblade one, you know, he was still with us.

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:05.800
Lots and lots of content creators and millions of subscribers and stuff like

02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.440
that's the type of audience that normally are people that participate.

02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:13.400
So we've got some of them as trainers right now, which is cool.

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:15.720
So I'm looking to get some time with them.

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:20.080
We hung out with CPK not that long ago earlier this week,

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:24.680
but I haven't really been on the train server as much as I probably should.

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.920
But this week, for sure, I'm going to get time in.

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:30.400
S2100 Matt in chat says really happy for you, Loki.

02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:32.720
You've worked hard on your content and it's paying off now.

02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:35.560
Yeah, you know, I hope so. Yeah, no pressure.

02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:36.440
We'll all be watching.

02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:36.800
But you know what?

02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:38.200
Just like I said, have fun with it.

02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:39.480
Like, just go in. Yeah.

02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.480
Have fun with it.

02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:42.000
Make the connections.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.880
Win them over with humor.

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:46.400
You know, you're going to you're going to be fine.

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:47.840
We have a good group.

02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.600
We've got like Binnish is super energetic people.

02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:54.040
You know, they're funny and they're absolutely funny.

02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:56.760
And then, of course, Errington.

02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:57.960
You know, it's a good group of people.

02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:00.120
So I think we have good chemistry and I think it'll be a lot of fun.

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:02.600
One other question I have to ask.

02:12:02.600 --> 02:12:05.440
What does Mrs. Loki think of this?

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:07.440
I just don't understand it.

02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:09.240
You know, Minecraft stuff.

02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:10.960
Yeah, OK, fair enough.

02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:14.480
All right. Before we roll credits tonight,

02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:17.080
I want to thank everybody for listening to orange on radio this week.

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.640
Thank you so much.

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.320
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the program,

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.680
tell a friend or two about the show.

02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:22.680
Help us spread the word.

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:24.480
We are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:27.120
but we just need more voices in the room to put out on air.

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:29.960
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify

02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.760
or wherever it is you found this podcast.

02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:33.360
Those go an awful long way.

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:34.960
So it's super appreciate that.

02:12:34.960 --> 02:12:37.320
Obviously, a lot of fun stuff coming up in the future

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:40.200
with Loki's Minecraft Championship coming up this weekend.

02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:42.960
I've got Dragon Con coming up in just over 10 days.

02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:44.760
So very excited.

02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:47.000
I hope to meet some of you at Dragon Con again this year.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:47.640
It'll be a lot of fun.

02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:51.800
Unfortunately, the panels have still not been released to the app.

02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:54.560
I have a feeling

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:58.080
just my gut tells me some of the contingency for SAG after strike.

02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:01.000
I think part of them really hopes they get it worked out this next week

02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:03.280
because I think some of them are returning to the table.

02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:06.840
So I feel like Dragon Con has like a plan A and a plan B,

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.840
and they're waiting for which button to push that.

02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:09.840
I know I know nothing.

02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:11.240
That's just my speculation.

02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:14.520
But usually two weeks before the event, the app has gone live.

02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:15.920
So we'll we'll see.

02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:18.000
But anyway, I'm really excited about that.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.760
Really excited to be back here again in seven days with all of you.

02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:23.240
Let's get everybody's final thought before we wrap up for the night.

02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:25.160
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:27.240
A big week.

02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:29.480
Yeah, my final thought.

02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:30.480
Big two weeks.

02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:32.160
So thank you, everybody.

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.200
Thank you so much for being here.

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.560
We'll see you again in seven days.

02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:36.120
Thanks so much for joining us tonight.

02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:38.400
Have a wonderful night, everybody. Bye bye.
