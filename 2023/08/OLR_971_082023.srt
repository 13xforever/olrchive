00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
Twitch is now going to block banned users from watching your stream, finally!

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,200
It won't block them from watching clips, nor bots, nor signing out and watching your

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,400
stream again, but it did take developers time to implement and begin rolling out to check

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,140
off a box despite the immensely trivial workarounds.

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,340
This is the I forgot my microphone intro.

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,860
Now it's time for your hosts Rob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Loki to tell you more about

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,140
this story and the rest of the week's gaming news, starting right now on the show where

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,820
every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,580
Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,240
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,460
It is Orange Lounge Radio and we are back once again with episode number 971 of our

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,660
show for tonight, August the 20th of 2023.

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,020
My name is Rob Roberts and you just heard here at the top of the show there our voice

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,560
over guy Jason and yes, if his audio sounds a little different tonight, you want to talk

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,940
about dedication.

16
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,220
He's traveling right now, didn't have his normal microphone.

17
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:18,040
He did that with a laptop microphone from his car to get that audio intro in locked

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,960
in about 20 minutes ago tonight here as we tape live at the voice keys network vog network.com.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,000
Speaking of dedication joining myself, Rob Roberts here every week is the one and only

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,880
dark Sakura or Jamie Summers dedication.

21
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:43,080
I mean, I dedicate this show to my bed where I collapsed into after a very long day yesterday.

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,120
Yeah, you were you were at California extreme this weekend, huh?

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
Yeah, sure was.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,560
Yeah, I was able to make it again.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,280
But it was something very busy and I'm glad honestly enough for everyone who talks shit

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
about crocs.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,080
They are damn comfy for for a long convention.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
Maybe, maybe I need to get some for Dragon Con coming up.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,200
Who knows?

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,480
So did you have a good time?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Did you have a good time over?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,640
I know we'll get into some of the games you played and stuff.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,440
But did you have a good time overall at California extreme?

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880
Oh, I totally did.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,280
I totally, totally did.

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,040
And I came home with a cute little Pikachu that if you're following me on the socials,

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,440
you might have seen it.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,080
I did.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,360
I saw a cute little picture.

40
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,840
What was it?

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,920
Was it like a it was like a World Championship Pikachu or something?

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,480
It's cute.

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,360
No, he's riding a train wearing a little conductor outfit.

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
Oh, okay.

45
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,640
Okay.

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,480
I thought it might have been from one of the recent cities or something, but that's cool.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,880
Cute.

48
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,240
I don't I don't know.

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,320
But he was cute.

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,600
And the guy gave me five bucks off.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,320
All right.

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Hurray for a deal.

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,000
Love it.

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,160
All right.

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,360
So we're gonna come back and talk more about California stream a little later.

56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,880
But I also want to introduce the one and only tech master Loki.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,880
Hello.

58
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,640
Hi, Loki.

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,440
How are you?

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm good.

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,800
You've had you've had a little bit of a week, haven't you?

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,880
Yeah, it doesn't even seem like it's been this week.

63
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,400
So it's like, yeah, it's just, that seems like it's so distant in the past.

64
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Let me let me ask this first off, because I know we're going to talk a little bit about Minecraft, a lot of it about Minecraft here in a minute.

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,520
But you've got like another content creator playing there behind you in Minecraft.

66
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,760
What is this all about this video?

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Because again, we do tape live at the voice geeks network twitch.tv slash VOG network every Sunday night at nine o'clock Eastern six o'clock Pacific right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

68
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,720
And when you tune in live, you can see things like visuals.

69
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:41,880
And Loki's got I'm commenting on this visual because it definitely we're going to talk Minecraft, but I'm curious who this particular content creator is and what its relation is to what we're going to talk about.

70
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,840
So that's major.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,280
Not only do does he participate in MCC, but he also runs it.

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:03,640
So this is his his VOD from the last they call it Canon MCC where the actual players that are invited to MCC on a regular basis play.

73
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,200
So it's MCC 33.

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,480
And they believe they were the aqua axolotls.

75
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:17,880
That's probably probably wrong now that I think of it, but it was the one the first episode where Etho was in there and stuff.

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,960
It said it's supposed to be recommended watching for me because it gives me an idea of how all the games are played.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:38,400
But this is let's talk about the relevance of that real quick here and talking about this whole Minecraft championships, because let's see, I seem to remember a couple of weeks ago on the show, you came on here and you said, Oh, yeah, you know, really, you know, you've had this group that you've been working

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,400
with for a while, this channel 64 and your Minecraft creation, which you really got into in the last couple of years.

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,760
And everybody, I would hope at this point knows about your YouTube channel.

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:05:01,160
But if for some reason they don't Loki or on YouTube, you've got these awesome Minecraft videos, these big builds, these mega man inspired gigantic builds that one day minecraft.net will finally recognize one of these two

81
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
that ship has sailed there.

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,280
They've already moved on to like with SpongeBob or something.

83
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,160
No, that's turtles.

84
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,480
Ninja Turtles is a new one.

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah, we love Ninja Turtles.

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,360
At least Tiger Claw loves Ninja Turtles.

87
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,840
Anyway, so a couple weeks on the show, you said, Oh, yeah, my team were applying to this Minecraft championship thing is like a really big deal.

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,360
But like all these people apply and like there's there's no chance in hell that we're going to get in.

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
We're not going to get into this.

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
We're doing it for the experience, the fun and all this stuff.

91
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,280
Loki, do you have any news you'd like to share with us this week?

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
So apparently there was a chance in hell that we would get into it, and we did.

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,360
We are one of 10 teams that will be competing next Saturday in MCC rising to.

94
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,600
So MCC, that stands for Minecraft Creator Championship.

95
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:57,440
And basically it is it's like I guess it's sort of like the Olympics or like Super Bowl of Minecraft in like minigames and stuff.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,040
So they have a bunch of different games, everything from like parkour to

97
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,640
there's like a game.

98
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
It's like Mario Kart almost.

99
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,720
It's called Ace Race.

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
It's pretty fun.

101
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,680
PVP stuff, survival stuff, there's puzzles, there's a lot of teamwork things.

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
So it's like Mario Party in Minecraft for a ton of people.

103
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,280
Sort of, kind of.

104
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,720
Yeah, it's but it's basically there's like

105
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,040
I think it's like eight different games.

106
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,520
So the games are going to get announced later this week

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,840
because they just hint at it.

108
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,560
You know what you're going to be playing and then.

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,760
Then, yeah, Saturday, it's going to be at least like four hours,

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,480
four to five hours of streaming as we, you know, play.

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,560
So we're the orange ocelots.

112
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,480
I like the fact that we got orange.

113
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
And that was right.

114
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,280
You didn't ask for colors.

115
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,240
Well, they tried to assign everybody

116
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,800
the color of the team that they applied with.

117
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,640
So we were the Crimson cast members.

118
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,880
And so there was already another red team.

119
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,920
They're like, well, orange was the closest thing we had.

120
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,840
So we put you in order to play.

121
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,720
That's fine.

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,840
It was meant to be.

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,000
We only did Crimson cast members because it rhymed with CNC.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,640
So that was about it.

125
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,600
But yeah, it's been

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,600
big, crazy and extremely stressful for sure, because,

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,640
you know, they're one of the teams.

128
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,600
I mean, like honestly, like I going into it,

129
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,880
I'm not great at like competitive Minecraft stuff.

130
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,080
I build stuff.

131
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,200
I play around with friends and stuff and I can edit videos

132
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,320
and I'm doing that stuff pretty regular.

133
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,720
There's another team that all they do is grind MCC Island stuff.

134
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,600
So of course, they're going to come in and just dominate everything.

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,280
But that's not really what MCC is about, though, too, because in the canon MCC,

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,720
you have content creators like there are people from hermitcraft.

137
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,120
There's quite a few of them actually participate in MCC

138
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,480
and they're not like PvP gods or parkour gods at all.

139
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,120
I mean, it's just kind of just participating and having fun with it.

140
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,600
And so I was stressing this myself out way too much about everything,

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,120
because, you know, I'm like, oh, man, I'm going to be terrible.

142
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,040
I don't want to get last place.

143
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,920
Like I just this is going to be horrible.

144
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,280
Everyone's expecting us to do well.

145
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,360
This is not going to go well at all.

146
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,640
I mean, it's fine.

147
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,680
There's a little bit there's a little bit of that as well.

148
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,400
But like you got there's 40 content creators in this thing.

149
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,720
At least 20 of them have to be feeling how you feel.

150
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah. And there's it's not it's all varying sizes.

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,480
So like our team, you know, we have content creators are all about,

152
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,080
you know, a thousand subs, 1500 subs and under.

153
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,160
There's another team that's kind of like that as well.

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,760
There's some that have, you know, 50,000 subs or 100,000 subs.

155
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
So it's varying sizes.

156
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,040
And it it was up to us major and not crew folks that put on the event

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,800
to decide who they felt were going to be the most entertaining to watch.

158
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,920
And so thankfully, they picked us.

159
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,240
They liked our video, your little intro video.

160
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
And it is over on Twitter.

161
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,960
And I saw it on your Twitter over at Loki or it was really funny.

162
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,760
Like, I don't even like I don't follow the Minecraft memes and all that.

163
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,680
But it was it was easy enough for me to follow.

164
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,600
And like, obviously, you made like a really funny age joke about it,

165
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,320
about why you do the content creation.

166
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,720
Like, I'm so old and I'm so lonely and I laughed. It's good.

167
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,840
So and that's that's the thing to do is that like,

168
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,480
if you feel like you're flopping or whatever, just make it funny.

169
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,560
Like that's exactly that's all you have to make it funny.

170
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,920
And it doesn't matter if your last place my last place hilariously.

171
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, the thing is, like I know in context, I decided like, OK, well,

172
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,360
you know, I'm like really stressing myself out about it,

173
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,920
like trying to get like really good stuff because I'm not good at parkour.

174
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,480
I tried a race stuff on the practice server.

175
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,600
I'm all right at it.

176
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,920
But like there's a lot of people that are taking it way more seriously than that.

177
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,880
But at the same time, like, well, wait a second.

178
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,160
Like, you know, people that I watch, like on Hermitcraft and stuff,

179
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm like, where are they placing on these MCCs?

180
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,280
And lo and behold, they're in the bottom 25 percent as well.

181
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,200
So I'm like, OK, I don't feel as bad anymore.

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,880
Like this is this is the the level of skill that

183
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,080
a content creator similar to myself would have.

184
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm like, OK, that's like a load off a bit still stressful

185
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,360
because I still want to be entertaining and stuff.

186
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,520
Yeah, and I don't stream nearly enough. But

187
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,000
this week, a lot, you know, I have the whole week off to

188
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,280
well, a lot of things.

189
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,080
So we just started our season three of our Channel 64.

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,440
So that was something that we've been doing this weekend.

191
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,920
I'm still editing my finale for season two, which is ridiculously complex.

192
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,960
It's like a it's like a movie.

193
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,520
It's just ridiculous what so that'll come out hopefully this week.

194
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,960
Maybe next week, I'm trying to get it out sooner than later

195
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,280
because, you know, people are going to be having season three videos out

196
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,400
and that's going to be ridiculous. I'm the last one.

197
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,120
And then, of course, MCC rising

198
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,400
training stream. So we're going to be doing a lot of that this week.

199
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,960
We have an interview with one of the MCC channels tomorrow.

200
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,040
So that'll be fun.

201
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,720
We've got fan art.

202
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,280
I was going to say, I've never gotten fan art before.

203
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,400
So so looking at our chat over at twitch.tv, such a VOG network

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,600
where we do tape live on Sunday nights.

205
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
S2100 Matt is asking, I'm sure your subs and follows have jumped

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,240
since this happened.

207
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,000
Not by a lot.

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,840
It did appear to well, it did appear to me looking at social media

209
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,920
that, you know, there were a lot of people like I know you'd said

210
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,720
on the show a couple of weeks ago, this is kind of a big deal.

211
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
But of course, I don't follow Minecraft that community as closely.

212
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
I was kind of like, oh, well, I, you know, a big deal

213
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,400
is kind of a relative thing, right?

214
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
It's what's important to you.

215
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,200
But then I was noticing in like the replies to like your application video

216
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
that had been posted, there's that like a lot of people seemed to.

217
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
Yeah. And then I saw the fan art thing as well and all that.

218
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,960
So I was like, dang, this thing definitely has its fans and people.

219
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,480
People get into it like it's a sports like it's the Olympics, basically.

220
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,560
You know, yeah, there's been like like I was looking at my sub count.

221
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,840
So I've gained like 30 subs since Wednesday, which is that's

222
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,440
pretty good. I take 30 subs for the network.

223
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,080
YouTube to say, you know, I'll take it.

224
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,360
Like, honestly, I'm not I'm not like only 30, you know, whatever. That's fine.

225
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,120
But the whole point was to just get our names out there.

226
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,160
So now there's people that a lot of people like, especially when the

227
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,280
reveals of the teams came out, they're like,

228
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,760
we don't know who these people are.

229
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,680
Yeah, and that's not necessarily us, but like a lot of different creators

230
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,800
are like, I've never heard of these creators before.

231
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,560
I'm going to go check them out.

232
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,640
So that's kind of cool.

233
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm still trying to leverage this into getting noticed

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,560
by more people from Hermitcraft and others.

235
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,320
So like one of our coaches is this guy goes by named Cubfan,

236
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,240
who is one of the hermits as well.

237
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,480
So I'm going to try to convince the coaches this week.

238
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,280
We'll see how that goes.

239
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,520
But like, yeah, it's just it's fun just to get to meet

240
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,320
some of these people and stuff, and the teams have been really cool.

241
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,400
Yeah, I mean, I hope I hope it works out, because like, I know

242
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,120
a lot of like the people that have been in like MCC rising in the past, like,

243
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,320
you know, their channels do eventually do better later on.

244
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,160
But like, I don't know, I don't think it's going to like,

245
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,920
we're not going to just jump all of a sudden, like,

246
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,040
I'm not going to have like 100,000 subs in a month or something like that.

247
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,840
I think I think the right way you're looking at it

248
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,000
is like the potential collaborations in the future and getting to know

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,280
other people and, you know, working on, you know, it's just like

250
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,480
kind of like how you ended up with this group you're with now.

251
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
You didn't start with the intent to do that.

252
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,680
You just networked among other smaller content creators

253
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,640
and now found yourself where you are.

254
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,400
And now look at what you've accomplished together in this giant Olympic thing.

255
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,560
So it only goes up from there, right?

256
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,840
Yeah, hopefully. Yeah.

257
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,560
So so yeah, next week, next week, it's going to be Saturday

258
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,600
at 12 Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

259
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,440
Yeah. Come come watch me compete in the MCC championships

260
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,680
and our MCC championships.

261
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,240
It's going to be nuts.

262
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,440
I can't wait.

263
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,640
Here's the hard part, too, about it.

264
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,760
Like, see, it's so on our practice server and stuff like they have

265
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,640
some of the games, but like at least half of the games you can't practice.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
You just go into it.

267
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
You got to you have to watch some videos, figure out how it's played

268
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,840
and good luck.

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,000
So it'll it'll be fun.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,360
All right. Well, good luck to you.

271
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,880
Can't wait to see on Saturday.

272
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,320
We'll be spamming those links all over socials as we root you on

273
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,640
and the orange ocelots.

274
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,680
All right. Well, let's get into our kickoff topic for tonight

275
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,320
and then we'll get into our gaming weeks, of course.

276
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,840
But first, let's talk about some of the big news in gaming.

277
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,640
And I guess appropriate for Minecraft, because this was one of the biggest games

278
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,800
that we saw on.

279
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,120
Obviously, this game has evolved a lot, a lot, a lot since then.

280
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,440
But let's talk a little bit about one of its very first platforms,

281
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,240
the Xbox 360 and the big news that came out about that this week.

282
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,840
Look, you want to start us off here.

283
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,080
Yeah. So basically, Microsoft is shutting down the Xbox 360 marketplace,

284
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,560
which makes sense because we're talking like a console

285
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,800
that's two generations old at this point.

286
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,200
But, you know, they are giving you a little bit of a head's notice.

287
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,200
So July 29, 2024 is when that's going to be going down.

288
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,800
At that time, you just won't be able to purchase new games for the Xbox 360.

289
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,800
So if you're looking to get some digital games on the 360,

290
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,720
you got a year to do it.

291
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,640
And then after that, they said this change will not affect your ability

292
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,280
to play Xbox 360 games or DLC you've already purchased.

293
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,240
It's just purchasing new things, which I mean, yeah,

294
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,600
eventually you got to shut down those storefronts.

295
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,440
It's, you know, 18 years old as the console here.

296
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,480
I mean, it's just it's bound to happen at some point.

297
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,720
So it's one of those things where it's like it is the end of an era.

298
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,840
But at the same time, it's like, dang, like, especially when,

299
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,440
you know, it's coming off of the news that like Nintendo shut down the Wii U store

300
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,480
not that long ago, and the Wii U was certainly a newer system

301
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,960
than the Xbox 360 to go for 18 years is a long time.

302
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,360
And what I think is particularly notable about this is especially,

303
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,720
you know, again, in contrast to something like Nintendo

304
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,280
that recently shut a storefront down, is that really this is just about

305
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,040
actually buying things on an actual Xbox 360.

306
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,760
And that's just buying new things.

307
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,000
It has nothing to do with redownloading things you already bought.

308
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,360
You can do that or DLC that you already buy. You can do that.

309
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,240
If you want to buy Xbox 360 games on your Xbox

310
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,640
one or your Xbox Series X, S, et cetera, you can still do that.

311
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,480
Now, of course, not every Xbox 360 game is playable.

312
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,240
They didn't get backwards compatibility for everything or licensing updates

313
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,960
or what have you for everything.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,560
But that's still a really big chunk of games

315
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,920
that isn't going away from all of this.

316
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,680
Again, in contrast to what we've seen other storefronts do,

317
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,640
I'd almost argue that Microsoft is doing this the way

318
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,800
I think we wish other consoles would sunset.

319
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,320
You know, maybe Microsoft has that advantage of that.

320
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,960
They still have this huge infrastructure because they are Windows,

321
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,520
you know, essentially at the end of the day.

322
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,840
You know, so they have the server capacity and all that to do this.

323
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,040
But, you know, now it does affect like if you own movies and things like that.

324
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,520
I believe that's the one kind of interesting thing,

325
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,920
because I remember you could get TV shows on Xbox 360 and play them that way.

326
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,200
I remember Heroes, the TV show, you could get that on Xbox 360.

327
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,040
And I think I own an episode or two because that's how I watched it,

328
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,760
how I watched an episode that I missed.

329
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,080
So I would not be able to watch those anymore on my Xbox 360.

330
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,360
That is something that's going away.

331
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,880
Again, I believe it's licensing, et cetera, et cetera.

332
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,320
But Microsoft is giving you a year's notice

333
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,560
that your digital library will still transfer to other systems

334
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,960
or a mobile device or, you know, other other things like that.

335
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,680
So I do feel like Microsoft is going about this the right way

336
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,280
and is kind of setting the model in some ways.

337
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,160
Is it perfect?

338
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,120
No, but is it about the best we can hope for from a big company like Microsoft?

339
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,080
Yeah, I think so. I think so.

340
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,960
So. Darkstalker, I don't know if you were raising your hand or what.

341
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,880
It's hard to tell with the Vtuber sometimes.

342
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,320
I was doing a shrug emoji.

343
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,160
Yeah, well, you don't it's not something

344
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,280
that really affects you because you weren't a big 360 gamer.

345
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,560
We have one, I don't think I've hooked it up in. Yeah.

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,440
I have to think about it a while.

347
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,440
I have one or two Xbox 360.

348
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
I say one or two because I'm pretty sure Alan had one when we,

349
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,680
you know, consolidated our lives.

350
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,560
So I think we have two.

351
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,080
But I couldn't tell you the last time we turned that on.

352
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,320
I mean, I do miss things that you can't play backwards compatible,

353
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,400
like DDR Universe is a great example for music game fans,

354
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,840
you know, because DDR

355
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,320
Ultramix already went away with the original Xbox.

356
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,960
So DDR Universe is going to be going away essentially.

357
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,680
But, you know, at the same time, it's like.

358
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,040
It's if you own the disk, you could still play it on an actual 360.

359
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,880
Nobody's taking that away.

360
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,840
So, yeah, it's it's it's just the digital storefront

361
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,000
and some of the movie TV stuff.

362
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,440
So as Joe 100 Matt in chat says, RIP the original TV sports, TV sports.

363
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,120
Yes, all of that.

364
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,000
Bobby Blackwell also confirming I own a couple of specific

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
episodes of TV shows on the Microsoft Store.

366
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,720
I just remember they they used to give away the Guild on their team.

367
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,120
Remember that old Felicia Day short thing, the Guild?

368
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,480
Yeah, that was on there, too.

369
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,960
I don't know if that's considered TV show or if that was like a different thing.

370
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,280
I don't know how they because you used to be web series originally.

371
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,440
Yeah, you used to be able to watch movie trailers on 360 as well, I'm pretty sure.

372
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,520
So I'm not sure if those just all kind of count as TV shows or what.

373
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,680
But at this point, when YouTube isn't,

374
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,960
you know, it's like you can kind of go find what you need to find. Right.

375
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,240
But let's see.

376
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,920
Bobby Blackwell says I have one and it's in my office, but it's not hooked up

377
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,440
because this old TV only has one HDMI port.

378
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,840
So anyway, in one year's time,

379
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,480
we will be saying rest in peace to the Xbox 360 storefront.

380
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,480
But the Xbox 360 as a device lives on.

381
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,280
You can still see an Xbox 360 at California Extreme in 20 years,

382
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,560
and it will still be able to play things like DDR universe.

383
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,480
There wasn't one this year.

384
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,320
Well, it might not be old enough yet,

385
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,400
but at some point it'll be at some point it'll be a museum.

386
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
In the end, nothing lasts. Yep.

387
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,520
As Joe and Matt says, I miss afterburner climax.

388
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,760
It got delisted a bit, but it was never made backward compatible past 360.

389
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,000
Probably because the backwards compatibility or because the delisting,

390
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,560
excuse me, I'm sure I'll have to spend 50 dollars for it

391
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,680
as part of a Sega collection Sunday.

392
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,880
Bobby Blackwell also pointing out another great element of this news

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,160
is that 360 multiplayer games will still work. Yes. Yeah, that's good.

394
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,240
And again, that's probably. Yeah.

395
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,920
A plus of it being tied into the greater windows

396
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,880
and, you know, everything that Microsoft does with that, because.

397
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,680
You know, when they pulled the plug on the Nintendo storefronts that.

398
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,720
Though you couldn't even play the Nintendo games online anymore,

399
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,080
like the whole Nintendo online service went down.

400
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,440
So I think that's really cool that they're keeping that intact.

401
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,040
Yeah. Bobby says this is literally just them shutting down

402
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,760
the financial aspect and the video DRM aspect.

403
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,440
Pretty much. Pretty much so.

404
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,960
Yeah. And a whole year's notice,

405
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,240
which I want to say is longer than we got with some of the Nintendo news.

406
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,400
I keep picking on Nintendo.

407
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
It's not like other platforms haven't done this,

408
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,440
but in the day and age that we live in, we're more and more. What's that?

409
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,360
I thought it's just so easy. Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
As more and more platforms go digital,

411
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,440
this is just something we're going to talk about more and more for sure. So.

412
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,760
All right. Like it's like we may as well just accept the inevitable.

413
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,840
Yeah, right. Yeah.

414
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,560
All right. Well, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks, of course,

415
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,960
in a segment called How Was Your Gaming Week,

416
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,080
where we talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

417
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,760
So Dark Soccer, I'm sure you had a busy weekend.

418
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,320
How was your gaming week?

419
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,760
So I went to California Xtreme yesterday

420
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,480
and we stayed for a while.

421
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,720
It's 60 fucking bucks to park because there was a 49ers game.

422
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,760
Oh, bar. Oh, that's awful.

423
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,080
That's that's right. I forgot that it's in Santa Clara now.

424
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,320
It was ridiculous.

425
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,080
Exploitive, exploitative, whatever they call it. It's just horrible.

426
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,960
Yeah, well, it was we ended up, though.

427
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,600
I mean, Dan parked and I had brought like a

428
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,040
an ice cooler with like snacks for on the way and a couple of drinks.

429
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,640
So I mean, we it wasn't like we spent a whole lot inside the con.

430
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,120
But it was very eventful.

431
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
I did Reninda Melody once.

432
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,440
Who has the best T-shirt living my OK-est life.

433
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
I ran into Neil.

434
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,600
And that was great.

435
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,960
We hung out for a little bit.

436
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,760
I played a bunch of stuff, like at least I'd say 30

437
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,400
30 different games of various varieties.

438
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,440
So I will start I'm going to go through this quickly,

439
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,600
but there's a few things I want to focus on is so I played.

440
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
First of all, I did play some stuff in the console room.

441
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,560
They had a super graphics hooked up, so I played Aldines,

442
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,600
although they had a Daimakai Mura in earlier.

443
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,280
And I wished I'd played that instead because it's like one of the best home

444
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,920
ports and mega race for the Panasonic 3DO, which is garbage.

445
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,760
I love that game.

446
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,840
That was my first like CD-ROM game when I had like an external CD-ROM

447
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,480
for my PC because it would run on like a single speed or dual speed CD-ROM.

448
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
You were welcome to keep enjoying that game,

449
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,040
and I will just smile and nod and not know it's a bad game.

450
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,560
I completely agree, but I liked it at the time.

451
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Like I've watched video of it like after the fact, I'm like, wow, that's.

452
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,680
Really bad. I played this.

453
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,720
Really? And I like the one guy, though, he sort of

454
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,680
reminds me of Don Knotts from like Three's Company, like the host. Yeah.

455
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,720
Yeah. All right.

456
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,800
Well, moving on to the not quite categorizable games.

457
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,480
I played Baby Pac-Man, which was great.

458
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,160
I love Baby Pac-Man.

459
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,160
And they had it as a ticket game,

460
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,040
but it's got a pinball element to it called Ticket Tacto.

461
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,360
And you've got like a tic tac toe board that lights up

462
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,720
as you shoot a ball into one of eight holes.

463
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,600
There's a post between each hole.

464
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
And they're sort of diamond shaped.

465
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,240
So the the layout of it, they're they're on more of a curve

466
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,760
and you have to shoot up a ramp and land in one of the holes.

467
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,720
And then, you know, when you fill them all, you win however many tickets.

468
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,920
And it's it's it's a ticket muncher game.

469
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,280
But it was enjoyable for, you know, the

470
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,520
the 30 seconds I dedicated to it.

471
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,160
So I'll go over the pinballs next.

472
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,040
So, of course, I played Foo Fighters, which I still love that one.

473
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,800
I played Diner.

474
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,840
I played Sword of Fury,

475
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,360
which is a pretty fun table, if a little frustrating.

476
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,720
I played Legends of Valhalla, which is is it one of those Jersey Jack ones?

477
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,320
It was it was interesting.

478
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,000
Wasn't my favorite.

479
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,280
I did get to play one of my favorites, which is Circus Voltaire.

480
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,800
That is just an amazing table.

481
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,560
And then it was funny.

482
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,200
There's also I didn't play any of them because, of course, I owned them.

483
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,280
But they had a there's were lined up in this order.

484
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,560
They had Black Knight 2000.

485
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,640
They had Theater of Magic and a World Cup soccer.

486
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,200
If you switch out the Theater of Magic in the Black Knight 2000,

487
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,440
that's exactly the same order I have my three in.

488
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,840
You know, so it was just funny to me to see them together.

489
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
And then I played the new venom table.

490
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,200
I didn't get to get on a premium.

491
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:30,320
I thought the venom table was a little bit boring,

492
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,240
but I figured it was for people who don't like all the thrills

493
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,880
and chills of a Circus Voltaire type machine

494
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,360
that we're looking at right now on the other screen.

495
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

496
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,760
God, I'm still having audio issues this week.

497
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,560
My bad. You cut out for just a minute when you were talking about the venom table.

498
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,440
Go ahead. Oh, well, I thought the venom table,

499
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,760
at least the pro was interesting.

500
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,600
The premium looked a little bit better.

501
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,880
So I didn't get a chance to play it, but I would give it a chance if I saw it.

502
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,120
And they also they did have like the the James Bond tables

503
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
that are themed after different movies.

504
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,320
And they had a Godzilla, which we have a Godzilla right now,

505
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,080
where I think we did a temp trade for it.

506
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,680
And now for the the video games.

507
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
By the way, one last thing about that venom table

508
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,360
is it reminds me very much of Deadpool

509
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,760
with the little versus fighting modes and the stuff like that.

510
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,080
So if you played the Deadpool table, this is very similar.

511
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,080
So now going to the

512
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,960
the arcade games I played is I played a sit down Star Wars arcade.

513
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,600
I played of course, I had to play Beat Mania three, the final

514
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,720
had a lot of fun. I played Pepper 2.

515
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,840
I didn't play in foot pedal mode, this is me, my feet hurt.

516
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,920
I'm old. They did have some other music games

517
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,400
like a sound vortex and, you know, you beat and those things, DDR.

518
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,960
I played Pepper 2, which I've never been a big fan of,

519
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,560
and I just played it because it was there.

520
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,320
I played Nark. Oh, God.

521
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,560
And there was this guy behind me, like talking like some big know

522
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,920
it all about, you know, this machine, blah, blah, blah.

523
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,240
And I said, yeah, and it was in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

524
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,000
What? Yeah, the end when they're or the part

525
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,160
when they're in the warehouse and they're playing it there at the final boss.

526
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,280
Oh, I didn't know that.

527
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I'm like, hell yeah, you didn't know that.

528
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,640
Anyway, I played Professor Pac-Man.

529
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,040
Which is a.

530
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,680
When you're tired and you're not seeing things well,

531
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,080
then doing a find the reverse of this image is a pain in the ass.

532
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,080
Um, of course, I played kicks.

533
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,680
I love kicks. I played Dig Dug. I played Strider.

534
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,760
I played Bostonian Outrun.

535
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,680
It was a stand up Outrun. Super Don Quixote.

536
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,040
Sorry, I've never heard of a professor Pac-Man, and I had to go looking it up.

537
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,000
This is this. Oh, my gosh.

538
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Sorry. Flashing lights warning.

539
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Sorry, I didn't know.

540
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,520
But that's that's fascinating.

541
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
And this is another game that I do not know how to pronounce

542
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,360
and never have known how to pronounce.

543
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,520
And it's it wasn't even super that fun to me.

544
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,440
It was like Frogger and Mr.

545
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,120
Driller ish a bit.

546
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,560
But I'm going to mispronounce this.

547
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,640
I'm just going to spell it out. ZZY, ZZYXX.

548
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,400
So Ziziks maybe.

549
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,120
But it's you have these bricks moving back and forth with little gaps.

550
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,840
You have to go up in the gap and move around in the gap

551
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,800
and move around in the gap and move around the gap till you hit the top.

552
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,720
Yeah, I it was all right.

553
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,480
The name was more fun than the game.

554
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,320
I'm going to get past a few of these because I'm going to go back to them,

555
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,000
but I also played Pac-Man and Chomp Chomp.

556
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
And I played Xevious and I played Satan's Hollow,

557
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,120
which is oh, yeah, I love Satan's Hollow.

558
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,600
Yeah, shooting game.

559
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,200
And I played a point blank, too.

560
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,000
I love point blank.

561
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,840
Well, it's so funny because Dan and I have been talking about

562
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,400
point blank the other day and how we he wish he hadn't sold

563
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,680
all of our gun cons and everything and I was like, well, you know.

564
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,840
And so there were some oh, yeah.

565
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,240
And the other one I played was an unreleased game called Nightmare in the Dark.

566
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,920
But I mean, it's since been it's a complete game.

567
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
And you might you might hear something about that from me eventually.

568
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,360
So there were some indie games there, you know, the same

569
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,840
some of the same folks, I think they did Killer Queen.

570
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,680
There was a game called Death Ball.

571
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,160
A kind of victory where you and another person

572
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,000
had to kick a ball across into the opposite person's color,

573
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,560
and then it injures them.

574
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,000
But you're like if you're on the left and your enemies on the right,

575
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,520
your color is facing you on like a center partition

576
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,200
and their colors facing them on a second partition.

577
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,240
And you have to jump around and do stuff.

578
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,520
I only played it once.

579
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,480
I wasn't good at it and I didn't particularly enjoy it.

580
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,560
But yeah, that's it.

581
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,000
And it's it's I mean, there's some people who really love it.

582
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,600
For me, I was tired.

583
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,560
I was like, I don't want to be competitive.

584
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,480
There was another game called Cosmotrons.

585
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,320
That's another vectory type of game.

586
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,840
In fact, it's very modern vector.

587
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,320
And you you only have to

588
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,240
you have four buttons and one of them rotates your position.

589
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,080
And and then you have like one to keep going up and another to shoot.

590
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,880
And it's trying to get these targets on the screen.

591
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,160
It's very green vector on black background.

592
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,400
It's an interesting little game.

593
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,960
I didn't have enough time to really practice it to get good at it.

594
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,720
And then there was another one called Black Emperor.

595
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,120
And this one's kind of fun for as simple of a concept as it is.

596
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,440
It is a sort of endless runner game, but you're on like a motorbike

597
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,480
and your goal is to, number one, stay on the road

598
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,480
and stay on the center of the road.

599
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,120
Like the center of the screen is the best because you can run into obstacles

600
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,520
or if you go off the screen at all, then you crash.

601
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,080
And it's it's really simple.

602
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,680
You have literally, you know,

603
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,840
sort of a sliding controller to stay up or down.

604
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,800
Another flashy flash game.

605
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,640
Sorry, it's like lots of lots of big flashing.

606
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,240
Sorry for the folks watching on Twitch.

607
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,320
Well, and then you have your accelerator button and, you know, other things.

608
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,120
But the game, it's it's.

609
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,480
Pretty addictive, but

610
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,280
deceptively difficult.

611
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,120
And I mean, and see the whole point,

612
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,920
you know, if you get off that road or if you get off screen

613
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,760
and it is really easy because the the speed of the scrolling alters.

614
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,040
So you're having to constantly adjust to maintain that center area,

615
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,680
and it's really easy to get knocked off the screen or go too far ahead

616
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,160
and run into those barriers like just passed on the screen.

617
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,440
It's Desert Bus, Motorcycle Edition.

618
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,240
No, no, no, no, no.

619
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,000
It's it's more exciting, I think, than Desert Bus.

620
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,520
But yeah. So anyway,

621
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,120
that was that was pretty much everything I played.

622
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,320
You know, there were a bunch of other games.

623
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,680
I had a whole bunch of the sit down tables like

624
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,520
like they were playing Warlords, you know, in one of the rooms.

625
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,200
And I didn't see any of the giant machines, you know,

626
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,840
because they used to have like the giant

627
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,480
the the ticket Tetris, I guess, or the Space Invaders.

628
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,400
And then Dan.

629
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,600
Yeah, Dan was playing Warlords, and there was also a the Ferrari F

630
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,280
whatever game, the full cab.

631
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,120
And and, you know, there were folks, you know,

632
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,640
there was the Garage Band, not Garage Band stage, Rock Band.

633
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,840
Sorry, I've got Garage Band on the brain.

634
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,800
There was the Rock Band stage upstairs, and there was someone.

635
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,840
This this girl had to have been like 12, killing it on Heartbreaker.

636
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,040
I'm like, holy crap.

637
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,880
How do you know this song?

638
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,160
You know, and then. Raised right.

639
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,920
Like I have clothes older than you.

640
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,760
But and I hung out talking with, you know, some of the vendors up there.

641
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,800
People selling stuff out of their collections.

642
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,680
And I picked up a Pio Pio two remix

643
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,440
on Super Famicom to add to my collection of Pio Pio.

644
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:52,200
And and the guy there gave me a cotton CD that went with the rerelease.

645
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,560
He just had is like, do you like cotton?

646
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,840
I was like, hell, yeah, I like cotton. Here you go.

647
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,240
Thanks. And I mean, there was like one artist

648
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,440
in the small room and we chatted for a little bit.

649
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,760
And I bought I bought some of her merch because her stuff was really cute.

650
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,120
And and she does, I think, VTuber work.

651
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,200
So it was really cool.

652
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,960
And her name was also Jamie.

653
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,040
It's spelled differently than mine.

654
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,040
But yeah, I mean, the whole thing was was pretty nice.

655
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,080
And then there was a movie is like, I think,

656
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,240
the the person that saved pinball and did said it was a really good movie.

657
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,880
And I kind of wish I'd gone to watch it.

658
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,320
But at the same time, you know, it was nice being off on my own

659
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,240
and doing my own thing for a little bit because I wouldn't run into melody

660
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,480
otherwise. Yeah, yeah, that was that was it.

661
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,400
It was a really good time.

662
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
I played and of course, for the other stuff I played, I played Dead by Daylight.

663
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,320
I played I played Disney Dreamlight Valley.

664
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,840
And Weird Al.

665
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,760
At home, but speaking of Dead by Daylight,

666
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,200
you're you're on a little bit of a streaming break for a moment, right?

667
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,960
I think I was seeing not on purpose.

668
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,720
Yeah, just because.

669
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,880
Well, yeah, just because the stuff going on in your professional life.

670
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Yeah, I put myself on a vacation because I'm in training

671
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,440
at work for something I don't really want to do.

672
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,080
And it's going to have me basically

673
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,080
getting up at like five thirty in the morning because I start at seven.

674
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,960
So I'm going to be working

675
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,840
like an eight day a week schedule instead of my usual four by ten.

676
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,880
So while I put myself on official vacation,

677
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,080
it doesn't mean I'm not going to be doing some streaming.

678
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,840
Gotcha. So like I'm going to be on Tuesday for some Dead by Daylight.

679
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,120
You know, I'm not going to go without.

680
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,240
And I might play, you know, might log in to play Dreamlight Valley

681
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,560
or check out the I think there's some new content for Cult of the Lamb.

682
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,080
So we'll see.

683
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,360
I mean, I'm not going to be not streaming, but I'm not going to be on any kind

684
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,000
of official schedule until

685
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,280
the first Saturday in September.

686
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,040
OK, but that's the second, I believe.

687
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,520
Yeah, which is funny.

688
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,360
That's also the day after mine and the spouses

689
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,320
18th anniversary.

690
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,040
Cute. And the day before an episode, we won't be here

691
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,160
because I'll be out in Atlanta Labor Day weekend.

692
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,200
So more streaming.

693
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,000
Well, yeah, I guess I could do that or maybe maybe I'll sneak.

694
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,760
Maybe we'll get the cons one of the consoles hooked up

695
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,560
and play something together.

696
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,640
Who knows? There you go.

697
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,160
Maybe some Burning Rangers might happen.

698
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,560
All right. Well, let's move on to Loki.

699
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,800
I feel like we probably talked about a lot about your week in the earlier chat.

700
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,160
But let me check in anyway. How was your gaming week, Loki?

701
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,840
It was mostly editing, actually.

702
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,120
I've been trying to edit my final episode put together and all that stuff

703
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,840
and doing some edits and just,

704
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,320
you know, a lot of video editing stuff.

705
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,840
Minecraft wise, I did play on MCC,

706
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,480
the practice server for a bit, and I was getting slightly better at Ace Race.

707
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,400
That is until, you know, the trainers came in

708
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,240
and then they decided to blow all the records away.

709
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,040
But I got my time under three thirty, which was pretty decent,

710
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,080
considering that when I had started like 30 minutes before that,

711
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,680
I was at eight minutes.

712
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,320
So I'm still having trouble with

713
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,600
the I bet there's some people that won't practice at all.

714
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,120
I mean, there's people there.

715
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,600
There's people that just all they're doing is grinding times on that.

716
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,400
In fact, my my teammate is doing that right now.

717
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
Or I think he was. They were doing that.

718
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,240
You know, a little bit ago.

719
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,840
So, yeah, they've been grinding times on that for whatever reason.

720
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,280
But we've been playing some of the different games like they have

721
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,400
parkour tag and

722
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,520
dodge bolt, which I don't know why we're playing that,

723
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,640
because that's for the top two teams and.

724
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,040
We're not going to get the top two

725
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,760
and what else a hole in the wall.

726
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,240
Hole in the wall is fun.

727
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,640
I found a way to cheese that game.

728
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,000
I was able to actually get under some of the

729
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,960
the walls. It doesn't work all the time, though. And then.

730
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,080
Was it the park or a rocket

731
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,240
Spleef rocket, Spleef Rush is pretty fun.

732
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,800
We actually did get to.

733
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,760
So two weeks ago when we were not announcing anything yet,

734
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,280
we did get to go on to the actual MCC server,

735
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,600
like the one that the event's going to be on.

736
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,320
So we we get to play Ace Race.

737
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,640
Of course, in that I came in dead last because I have the habit of using

738
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,280
pushing forward twice to sprint.

739
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,120
You cannot do that.

740
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,080
That is not a good way to keep sprinting.

741
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,560
So now I've fixed that.

742
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,880
And then we also played rocket Spleef Rush, which was fun.

743
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,520
Basically, you have a rocket launcher

744
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,080
and you have to keep yourself up in the air without falling into the void.

745
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,120
And then other people can like knock you off things.

746
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,480
And it's a lot of fun.

747
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,880
But yeah, it was just fun just to get to walk around that

748
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,240
that server and everything and just see everything.

749
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,240
They've got a memorial to Technoblade there, which is pretty cool

750
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,720
because he participated in a lot of different events.

751
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,280
Yeah, it's just I'm very excited to see what happens.

752
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,560
I don't know what to expect yet.

753
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,960
The games look fun.

754
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,840
Like there's a game called Sands of Time where

755
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,440
you basically have to go through all these different vaults.

756
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
It's like a like an ancient Egyptian tomb, I guess.

757
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,600
You have to go through all these vaults and like there's different puzzles

758
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,960
and parkour and enemies, you have to fight and stuff

759
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,760
and you have to keep collecting sand so that it doesn't run out.

760
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,960
You have a big sand timer and you have to get out of the vault

761
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,280
with all your coins or as many coins as you can is the aim of the game.

762
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,160
So that looks like fun.

763
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,520
I'm hoping there's one that they've got, which I probably like this.

764
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,800
So it's what's it called? It's.

765
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,600
It's it's a building game, you have to build

766
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,640
basically something that they have built already,

767
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,840
but you have to go find the pieces of that build in like a shopping mall

768
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,120
or like a supermarket.

769
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,800
It's almost supermarket sweep.

770
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,600
OK, that sounds fun.

771
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,440
So that that looks like a lot of fun.

772
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,920
And then there's Grid Wars, which is another one, which is puzzle rooms

773
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,960
that you go into and you have to do different things like,

774
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,840
you know, get a minecart from one side to another or shoot targets on a wall

775
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,640
or solve word puzzles, solve different other puzzles in there.

776
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,640
And they have like survival games and stuff like that.

777
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
So there's a lot of interesting things.

778
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,200
I think we're have a lot of fun with it.

779
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,480
But yeah, so that and then getting my season three stuff

780
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,040
started on Channel 64.

781
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,120
So I had all the server maintenance stuff I was doing with that.

782
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,160
I did end up playing two days worth of season three.

783
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,040
I've already got my iron farm and build your breeder and all that stuff.

784
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,080
Still trying to figure out

785
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,240
what I'm going to even film for a first episode yet.

786
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,120
So it's fun.

787
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,800
Lots of it's nice to get to see all the new people

788
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,480
that are going to join the server this season.

789
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,280
So a lot of fresh new faces that are been around

790
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,440
while in our discord for a while.

791
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,240
And I'm very excited to play with them.

792
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,440
So, yeah, just the whole season and a lot, lot going on.

793
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
I really want to pass this week.

794
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,320
It's going to be a lot less stressful, that's for sure.

795
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,400
I'm sure you're going to do great again.

796
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,840
If you don't do great, make it funny.

797
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,560
It'll be fine.

798
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,800
We're going to make it funny, regardless of whether we do great or not.

799
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,200
All right. Awesome.

800
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,200
And for the life folks, sorry, I keep looking at my phone.

801
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,960
I'm getting updates from my sister who is in Long Beach, as I'm sure

802
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,320
you know, Southern California is getting hit with a hurricane.

803
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,600
Well, I guess tropical storm at this point.

804
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,400
But point being, the last time California was hit with one of those

805
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,400
was in the 1930s.

806
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,720
So, you know, California covers not built for that type of thing.

807
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,680
So no. Yeah.

808
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:59,200
My friend or my sister is in Long Beach and just sent me like the

809
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,160
I guess she has like a bamboo thing outside that just completely is

810
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,680
because, of course, it's all messed up now.

811
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,040
It's like made out of bamboo.

812
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,280
So, yeah, and as Rama points out in chat, then an earthquake happens.

813
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,600
So we definitely had the earthquake of 2023, by the way,

814
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,400
because it did come up in Discord.

815
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,000
We're nowhere near that, even though we're also in California is nowhere.

816
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,040
We're not even expected to get rain in the forecast.

817
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,680
It's cloudy outside and that's it.

818
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:28,120
So and I used my favorite graphic in our Discord over at vognetwork.com

819
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,280
slash Discord, which shows California, but it shows it on the East Coast.

820
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,960
So I was able to say, OK, the hurricane is hitting North Carolina

821
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,720
and we live near we live in Pennsylvania near the border of New York.

822
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,040
So we're not we're not anywhere near that.

823
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,680
But obviously, lots of people we know are

824
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,320
and including folks who listen to this show.

825
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,720
So I hope everyone is doing OK.

826
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,680
And part of the storm system is heading in toward Nevada.

827
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,280
So it's actually doing a big circle.

828
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,720
Yeah, yeah. And and I mean, it is so funny.

829
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,120
My mom's like, you warn him about the bread famine.

830
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,920
What I was like, I'm curious to see if the bread famine actually happens.

831
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,800
OK, there is a southern phenomenon when a hurricane hits.

832
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,600
Well, there's two. There's, of course, the Waffle House index.

833
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Yeah. Yeah, that I know about.

834
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,200
The other one is that if you were a little bit late going to the grocery store.

835
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,200
All that's left are hot dog buns.

836
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,640
Only hot dog buns.

837
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,720
Only and Bobby is right about about.

838
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,400
Yep. The milk, milk toast.

839
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,760
Yep. Milk and bread, milk and bread.

840
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,280
But the big thing is that the only thing left is hot dog buns.

841
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,920
If you're bread, man, my kids would be so stoked about that.

842
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,640
That's all they eat.

843
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,560
I mean, people panic by here, too, for big storms.

844
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,800
It's I don't know if it's that same thing.

845
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,640
But yeah. Yeah.

846
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,080
Even like when we get like a lot of rain, everyone just like buying out everything.

847
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,800
I was gonna say we had storms of 70 mile an hour winds over the winter.

848
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,280
We just didn't call them hurricanes because they weren't, you know,

849
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,640
the right because they weren't the right formation.

850
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,800
But they still had very strong winds.

851
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,120
But like my mom's like,

852
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,640
is it going to be a straight line or a swerve?

853
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
The swerve. All right.

854
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,520
Y'all are OK. Mm hmm.

855
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,320
Because I mean, that's the thing is that when you grow up, when there's hurricanes,

856
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,840
you're just sort of like, oh, OK, this again.

857
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,640
I mean, even though, yeah, the really big ones can be scary.

858
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,320
You know, the thing is that you prepare for them all pretty much the same way.

859
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,000
You have you fill your your tub with water and put a cap full of bleach in it.

860
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,280
So that you have clean drinking water, even if it's nasty.

861
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,080
You know, basically just disinfected water to have.

862
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,520
I guess modern day, you don't really need to tape up your windows,

863
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,880
but when I was a kid, you always, you know, duct taped your windows

864
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,880
so that if they broke, they wouldn't shatter. Right.

865
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,200
You know, just you stock up on food, you stock up on toilet paper,

866
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,800
you make sure that you've done all your laundry.

867
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,960
You make sure you've got coolers.

868
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,240
If you're lucky, you have a gas generator.

869
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,440
My uncle has a couple of them.

870
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,760
But the thing also is that houses back

871
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,120
where I'm from are built out of concrete.

872
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,920
Yeah. And metal. Yeah. And brick.

873
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,640
And houses out here are not are built out of plywood. Yeah.

874
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,120
They're built more for earthquake stuff than they are hurricane stuff.

875
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,360
So if that I don't know, I've seen some rickety construction.

876
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,960
I mean, honestly, I don't know that a plywood building like what we have here

877
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,280
has the right kind of foundation

878
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,000
for a lot of developments to withstand an earthquake.

879
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,080
I mean, here in Sacramento, it's not bad. We don't really get them.

880
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,400
But I don't know.

881
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,320
Wait, wait, let me get to my gaming week.

882
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,680
Talk about weather. No, it's fine. Sorry.

883
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,920
But with my gaming week, I want to talk about just

884
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,520
honestly, I didn't really play anything new, new.

885
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,800
I did play some theater rhythm,

886
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,400
which I had streamed a little bit because I was behind on DLC.

887
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,600
So I'm finally caught up.

888
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,200
I've played every song once still in the game, hundreds of songs.

889
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,040
So that's good.

890
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,360
And Diablo four, still my seasonal character has finally caught up

891
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,520
to my forever character by hitting level 61 today.

892
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,240
So still working on that.

893
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,680
And then I've actually been playing a bit more Overwatch two randomly.

894
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,040
I have a couple of friend groups that are super into it.

895
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,160
They keep trying to get me to play. So I'm like, OK.

896
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,760
And I'm finding like, oh, I'm maybe like I don't think I'm good at it,

897
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,920
but like I'm like, OK, maybe I'm not bad at it.

898
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,360
Like I thought like I was actually the thing about Overwatch

899
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,200
that I do know how to do

900
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,200
is I know how to change my hero to respond to the situation

901
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,040
that if the character I'm using is not working, I know to change to somebody else.

902
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,200
Like if we are having a really hard time picking off healers and I'm on DPS

903
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,320
and you know, maybe I'm Farah or somebody is just having a hard time,

904
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,840
you know, well, Farah can sometimes hit the back line depending on the map.

905
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,600
But like, I should switch to Widowmaker.

906
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,240
And yes, I actually play Widowmaker and I do pretty decent with her.

907
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,960
But I also know to switch the fuck off of her

908
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,800
if there's a Sombra or somebody that counters are real, real easy.

909
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:13,080
So yeah, like that's that's my biggest asset is I don't stick to one hero hero.

910
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,800
I try to play a variety.

911
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,960
So there is that.

912
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,280
So I honestly, that was really it for my gaming week.

913
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,120
I didn't play a lot of new stuff,

914
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,880
but I'm sure that will change in the coming weeks.

915
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:25,840
So. All right.

916
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,760
Quickly, before we get into the other news, I do.

917
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,760
I do also want to give a plug to our growing YouTube presence over at

918
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,920
YouTube VOG Network.

919
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,560
That's VOG Network on YouTube.

920
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,400
Just posted a couple more videos this week.

921
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,160
Last week, Dark Soccer and I talked about the Alien DLC

922
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,960
and Shane and I talked about Fan Fest.

923
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,960
Shane and I got together again to do a Final Fantasy 16 spoiler chat.

924
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,960
So that is available now over on YouTube.

925
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,880
If you've beaten the game or you just don't care

926
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,360
and you want to hear impressions anyway about the game.

927
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,040
And then I spent quite some time this I did a 20 minute video

928
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,280
talking about Pokemon Go routes in the game and that feature.

929
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,880
But the reason why I talked so long about it

930
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,720
is I also related it to a similar thing in Ingress missions.

931
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,000
And I kind of talked about the similarities, the differences,

932
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,920
and why didn't they just copy paste what they already had

933
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,240
and maybe try to get into some of that.

934
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,320
So it's a little bit of a deep dive in the feature and all that.

935
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,640
And I actually recorded myself doing this.

936
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,240
So I'm actually playing the game, but it's obviously time delayed.

937
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,560
I'm not out doing it in the real world.

938
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,720
But it was stuff I had recorded the day before

939
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,560
while I happened to be at the mall,

940
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,160
you know, doing a route there to kind of show what that's all about.

941
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,000
And I understand Go Fest in that game was happening this weekend.

942
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,080
I still don't know if I'm going to buy a ticket to the global one next weekend.

943
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:40,280
I'm not, although I like the routes feature and I like, you know,

944
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,760
overall some of Pokemon Go's features and getting out and moving.

945
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,400
I don't know if I agree with a lot of the direction the game's taken this year.

946
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,920
I still don't think Niantic has properly apologized

947
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,160
for what they did with the whole remote raid situation and all that.

948
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,560
And I think the best way to express my frustration is to vote my wallet.

949
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,920
And I feel like the only thing I don't have that I would get from paying for it

950
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,840
would be the new legendary, which whatever you never use those

951
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,320
those legendaries from Go Fest, you never actually use them in the game.

952
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,760
I think maybe Victini is the only one I ever actually use once in a great while.

953
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:20,120
And then that and M unknown.

954
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,560
I don't have an unknown M and I have like at least 15 letters.

955
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,560
I don't have M. That's the only one I need.

956
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,760
But like, I know I have friends that will play that will get plenty and I can just trade.

957
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,240
That's it. Yeah.

958
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,160
SG100Matt in chat says, I'm not buying it.

959
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,240
Go Fest a bit of dud.

960
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,760
And like Rob is saying, not happy with what Niantic has been doing.

961
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,360
Yeah, I think I'm going to vote my wallet.

962
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,960
I will probably still go out and play.

963
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
So maybe I'm not helping.

964
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,560
Maybe I'm being, you know, but I'll go out and catch shinies.

965
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,960
But that's more about me walking and just having incentive to do that

966
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,160
and go, you know, around downtown or something.

967
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,600
But that's because I kind of want to I want this weekend.

968
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:59,240
I want to do activities that are very like by myself because with Dragon Con coming up,

969
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,040
I don't want to catch covid two days before I leave for Dragon Con

970
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,400
because then that would be catastrophic

971
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,200
and really take away a lot of the awesome opportunities coming my way at Dragon Con this year

972
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,280
because I wouldn't be able to go.

973
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,640
So I'm going to just kind of keep to myself this next weekend and all that good stuff.

974
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,240
I realize, well, if I may, also spending a little bit of time by yourself

975
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,480
would be good for a little bit of self centering.

976
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,200
Yeah, no, you're around so many people.

977
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,040
For sure. For sure.

978
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,200
It's charging the batteries before extrovert central, for sure.

979
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,000
And then it's like, I know I'm putting myself in a very risky situation,

980
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,920
but, you know, I, I have to weigh the pros and cons on stuff.

981
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,040
I'll wear a mask.

982
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,960
And especially when crossing through the hotels and places like that,

983
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,440
just where I know it's going to be.

984
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,960
So, you know, try to protect myself that way.

985
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,240
But I know what we could do.

986
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,520
We could put a gas mask on you and have you walk around going, are you my mommy?

987
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,720
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Part of my cosplay out of it's. Yeah.

988
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,760
Yeah. An episode of Doctor Who.

989
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,880
Yeah. Yeah. Or, you know, cosplaying somebody that was a pandemic.

990
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,480
1920s with a big what do you what do they call the big beak masks?

991
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,480
Oh, plague doctor.

992
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,000
Yeah, like a plague doctor cosplaying a plague doctor.

993
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,640
Well, that wasn't the 1920s.

994
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,840
Yeah, that was way back when.

995
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,240
There's there's a lot about those, though,

996
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,000
that that isn't historically accurate, but I digress.

997
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,800
All right. Anyway, oh, great.

998
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,000
I have one I can lend you.

999
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,040
Matt says I have an M unknown.

1000
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,440
Perfect. Perfect. All right.

1001
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,320
Let's move on.

1002
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,360
Let's get into the news this week and we will start with Loki.

1003
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,840
Yep. So Twitch is actually going to allow us

1004
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,280
to now block banned users from watching your stream.

1005
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,400
So apparently you could just, you know, prevent them from actually chatting.

1006
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,480
But now you can prevent them from actually watching.

1007
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,360
So they can't harass you in other ways.

1008
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,520
This is the first on my list.

1009
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,640
This is supposed to be coming sometime in September.

1010
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,080
And when you block or ban someone,

1011
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,680
they'll no longer be able to view your stream, I think by default.

1012
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,800
So that's that's nice.

1013
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,800
It doesn't stop people from watching your VODs, though.

1014
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,920
But it's a starting for your clips, which would be part of your VODs, right?

1015
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,840
I mean, I'm kind of surprised this feature wasn't already in there,

1016
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,560
but like, wouldn't all you have to do is log out and you could still see it

1017
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,440
like that's that's what you can kind of do to read Twitter's

1018
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
where people have blocked you.

1019
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,560
You just I may or may not know this from experience.

1020
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,360
You can just log out and you can read it.

1021
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,040
Now, if they're friends locked and they've blocked you,

1022
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,960
then you're really not going to be able to read it.

1023
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,720
That's the only way. But nobody's friends locked on Twitch.

1024
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,920
What? Technically, the options there.

1025
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,080
But why would you use it?

1026
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,560
You would you wouldn't you know, you'd just be you wouldn't grow at all.

1027
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,200
You can't you can't do it that way. So.

1028
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,360
But yeah, I mean, I do agree

1029
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,440
that people shouldn't be watching a channel they've been banned from.

1030
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,760
So it's it's something like that.

1031
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,560
Didrom S says Twitch is trying to tie it to your IP address

1032
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,480
where you still can't view if you're logged out soon.

1033
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,840
You won't be able to block on birds.

1034
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,760
Oh, well, don't don't get me started on the VPN, though.

1035
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,680
Yeah. VPNs are easy. I've used VPN.

1036
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,640
I am a technological.

1037
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,200
You know, I don't know my stuff a lot, but I've used a VPN.

1038
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,480
I had to to play Fafasci 14 for a minute

1039
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,560
when I had my former Internet provider was having issues of 14.

1040
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,640
I used a VPN to get around it.

1041
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,200
So as Joe and Matt says, good.

1042
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,480
Twitch should also tell them to go outside, touch grass

1043
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,840
and stop being a shit to people.

1044
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,480
That would be funny.

1045
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,600
If that was a splash screen, you could show ban people.

1046
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,040
Why just Mariah Carey's obsessed album cover?

1047
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,680
I can think of, though, another thing that I don't like about it

1048
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,120
is that just think if someone that you had banned

1049
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,120
from talking in your chat could still add to your viewer numbers.

1050
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,880
Oh, like one of those like tab.

1051
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,480
Thanks. Thanks for like.

1052
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,080
Thanks for giving me free content.

1053
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,680
Right. What some people would do when they would get hate

1054
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,720
rated is they would immediately run ads on their channel and be like,

1055
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,640
thanks for the revenue.

1056
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,800
Basically, that's what I've done.

1057
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,720
That type of thinking. Yeah. Yeah, I do get that.

1058
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,080
Yeah. All right.

1059
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,080
Well, let's move on to something that hopefully doesn't have to ban

1060
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,480
a lot of people when they broadcast on different streaming services,

1061
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,640
and that's the Pokemon Championships.

1062
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,760
The Pokemon Company announced at the end of their championships

1063
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,520
that Honolulu is going to be the place where the Pokemon

1064
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,360
World Championships 2024 will be occurring.

1065
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,200
Now, obviously, this timing is not great

1066
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,040
with what is going on in Hawaii right now, because there's a lot of debate

1067
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,040
about is tourism appropriate in Hawaii right now and all this with what's

1068
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,880
going on with the Maui wildfires, which continue to be extremely devastating.

1069
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,800
However, Pokemon Company is doing a very good thing here

1070
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,600
that they are making an immediate monetary donation of two hundred

1071
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,600
thousand dollars to help relief efforts.

1072
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,880
In a statement, they said,

1073
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,320
Our hearts go out to all those who've been impacted by the devastating wildfires

1074
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,840
in Hawaii to support relief efforts.

1075
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,880
The Pokemon Company International is making an immediate monetary donation

1076
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,480
of two hundred thousand dollars to its partner at Global Giving

1077
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,920
through its Hawaii Wildlife Relief Fund.

1078
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,320
To learn more about Global Giving's local relief efforts

1079
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,360
and to join in supporting the people of Hawaii,

1080
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,600
please visit global giving dot org slash Pokemon.

1081
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,960
So that that is nice.

1082
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,240
And I'm sure this is the type of thing that contracts were booked.

1083
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,200
Venues were negotiated.

1084
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,200
Dotted lines were signed.

1085
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,480
Well, but it is also and I just want it because somebody will correct me

1086
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,320
if I don't say it.

1087
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,320
Honolulu is on a different island than, you know, Lahaina.

1088
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,120
Yes, but certainly the entire state is still feeling the impact

1089
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,400
because Oahu is supporting a lot of people

1090
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,200
that have suddenly had to relocate off of Maui due to what is going on

1091
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,000
and all that, you know, families and all this stuff.

1092
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,560
So the brunt of what is happening is being felt everywhere in the state.

1093
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,720
So, you know, there's a lot of talk about, you know,

1094
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,080
what is and isn't appropriate right now.

1095
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,720
But obviously all this stuff was signed and all this stuff well before

1096
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,120
the the fires happened. So.

1097
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,520
Um. Also, interesting, another game I played this weekend,

1098
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,560
I got together with some friends to play our good old Ingress game

1099
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,160
because there was a global event happening and there's

1100
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,920
there's ways you can kind of help the global event from other places.

1101
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,080
So we were getting together to do that.

1102
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,960
And there was talk about that there's actually one of these,

1103
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,000
you know, events competitions is in Honolulu in December.

1104
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,400
Again, it was announced back in January that it was going to be happening

1105
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,200
in December in Honolulu.

1106
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,960
But now a lot of question about.

1107
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,240
I wonder if they'll go through with it at this point.

1108
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,960
So it'd be interesting because I really wanted to go at one point.

1109
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,960
Now I'm like, no, the the travel dollars this year got spent.

1110
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,640
I'm not because there's another one in Tacoma,

1111
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,760
but it's the weekend after Dragon Con.

1112
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,920
And I was like, oh, there's no way, no way I can go to that.

1113
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,480
It's too close to Dragon Con.

1114
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,760
But I was hoping maybe I could make Honolulu work, but.

1115
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,000
We're doing TwitchCon instead.

1116
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,440
So, yeah, I'm I'm actually I was going to drive to TwitchCon.

1117
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,400
I'm thinking about flying instead.

1118
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,360
Oh, we're flying, but we have to fly funky because

1119
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,400
we're going to Disneyland for Oogie Boogie like the same week.

1120
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,640
So we have to fly to Long Beach and then Long Beach to Vegas, Vegas to home.

1121
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,720
So I had to book three separate flights.

1122
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,920
But yeah, the Vegas flight is so easy.

1123
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,920
And there's there you can see.

1124
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,920
Yeah, Southwest or Delta out of here.

1125
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,440
And I think one other airline does it, too.

1126
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,440
Oh, Spirit, but I'd never fly them.

1127
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,440
Just say, you know,

1128
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,440
Phil, if you get what you pay for related to that.

1129
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,600
Phil at night and chat says there's always another con or event around the corner.

1130
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,240
Truly, truly.

1131
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,560
There are definitely more than I can physically afford

1132
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,040
and attend in the same space. So.

1133
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,760
Bobby Blackwell says bring me back an Oogie Boogie pin.

1134
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,040
Yeah, absolutely.

1135
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,680
Bobby Blackwell says be prepared for a possible random screening

1136
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,000
because they do take a harder look at people with one way tickets.

1137
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,760
Well, both the husband and I have pre check

1138
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,800
and I know you can still get picked for one way screenings of that.

1139
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,960
But I mean, I'm not worried like they're not going to find anything because we.

1140
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,080
And honestly, we don't really we check because we usually fly

1141
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,680
Southwest almost all the time.

1142
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,800
The only time I don't fly Southwest is when I'm going to Atlanta

1143
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,440
and Delta was competitively priced

1144
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,960
because your bags go free on Southwest, which is so nice.

1145
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,560
So we check all of our bags.

1146
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,080
We don't carry anything on except like an actual like entertainment

1147
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,000
for the plane bag.

1148
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,720
And then like, you know, the things you're supposed to have just in case of

1149
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,440
complete and utter fuck ups in luggage, which, you know, could happen

1150
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,560
like the underwear, bag medicine, things like that. Yeah.

1151
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,800
So but, you know, so they're not going to find anything.

1152
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,760
So let them pull me.

1153
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,000
I don't care. Just leave time for that.

1154
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,160
Remember, we're flying out of Sacramento.

1155
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,280
So but I guess I guess to be fair, the other flights, you know, Vegas,

1156
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,560
I don't know how thorough or how efficient that airport is.

1157
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,280
So we'll see. They're pretty efficient from what I remember,

1158
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,600
because I it wasn't there not long ago, but it's a ways off anyway.

1159
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,840
All right. Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1160
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,480
So. This has been

1161
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,800
going around for a little bit.

1162
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,600
I think we expected it.

1163
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:50,840
But now Netflix is going to be opening up

1164
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,520
to a small number of their subscribers in Canada and the UK,

1165
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,080
according to a blog post to roll out

1166
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,280
this video game streaming service.

1167
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,560
It's going to select TVs and then PCs and Macs.

1168
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,760
X are on there in the next few weeks.

1169
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,920
I mean, we basically knew that they were expanding into games

1170
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,960
around 2021 when they had the Netflix game on mobile.

1171
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,280
But now they're trying to make it available on even more devices

1172
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,840
and setting up a test.

1173
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:32,480
There is a Netflix game controller app in the Apple App Store.

1174
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,720
And there's only two games that are going to be part of this test.

1175
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,200
One is Oxenfree

1176
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,760
and the other is Mulhugh's Mining Adventure,

1177
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,280
which is a gem mining arcade type game.

1178
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,000
You use your phones as a controller.

1179
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,640
So for the initial beta test, these TVs and connected

1180
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,520
TV devices will support the games.

1181
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,400
And that's the Amazon Fire TV streaming media players, Chromecast

1182
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,320
with Google TV, LG TVs, Nvidia Shield TV,

1183
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:11,640
Roku devices and TVs, Samsung smart TVs and Walmart on.

1184
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:18,760
So, you know, I actually have a Samsung TV, so who knows?

1185
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,520
Or no, my TV's an LG either way, but I'm not in Canada or UK.

1186
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,000
But folks who are in those areas, let us know how it goes.

1187
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,040
Yeah, if it's successful, it'll certainly roll out of the places, too.

1188
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,200
So there is that. Yeah. All right.

1189
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,480
Moving on, Loki's got more on a game I was talking about earlier.

1190
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,800
Yeah. So, you know, Overwatch,

1191
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,120
they've, you know, had a rough time

1192
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,080
with some decisions that weren't necessarily popular.

1193
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,120
And what do people do when they are upset with a company's decision?

1194
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,080
They head on over to Metacritic and review bomb them or the other platforms as well.

1195
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,000
So they start a change.org petition.

1196
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,440
Yeah, that's what that'll work.

1197
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,920
Yeah, for sure.

1198
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,760
So, of course, you know, Blizzard has responded to the Overwatch

1199
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,160
to review bombing with PR speak, as to be expected.

1200
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,600
This is although being review bombed isn't a fun experience.

1201
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It's been great to see lots of new players jump into Overwatch

1202
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,280
two for the first time.

1203
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,440
Our goal with Overwatch two is to make the game more accessible

1204
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,200
than ever for more people than ever before.

1205
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:35,920
And, you know, if we can't turn back the clock, then what can we do?

1206
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,440
We keep adding and improving Overwatch two.

1207
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,000
This is how we move forward.

1208
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,960
If I could turn.

1209
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,400
Yeah, but that kind of like also ignores all the fact that like you promise

1210
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,840
something, you didn't deliver it, and now you're charging

1211
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,800
for some of the things that you did promise originally as part of the base package.

1212
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,360
That's not really the same thing, but.

1213
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,160
I mean, what you going to do?

1214
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,200
Blizzard's going to blizzard.

1215
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,520
So, you know, honestly, if you're happy with it, play the game.

1216
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,200
If you're not happy with it, don't play the game.

1217
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,400
I mean, same thing with voting with your wallet.

1218
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,800
If you want to pay for that content, then pay for the content.

1219
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,800
But really, all you're doing is encouraging them to kind of do this kind of stuff.

1220
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:27,160
I mean, for me, it's no skin off my back because I'm not playing Overwatch two.

1221
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,760
And so therefore, the PV stuff doesn't really bother me.

1222
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,800
Here's here's how I feel about I want to talk about this, because I recently am more,

1223
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,800
you know, I played Overwatch two for like a week when it first came out.

1224
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,040
And only recently am I kind of getting back into it just because of friends

1225
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,120
that play it and, you know, peer pressure and playing games

1226
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,320
with friends is always more fun and that type of thing, right?

1227
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,040
Like, am I bothered at the lack of PV because they had promised originally?

1228
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,680
Yeah, I am, because that shit sounded pretty awesome.

1229
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,000
And I think it's a real bummer that they haven't really properly delivered on that.

1230
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,320
That's why I haven't really given Overwatch any money.

1231
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,240
You know, even though I've played it a bit, I really don't spend money on it

1232
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,880
because I'm not I'm not interested in skins and that sort of thing.

1233
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,920
I I will openly say, though, and I don't know if this is

1234
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,840
because of, you know, Microsoft coming in in the future or whatever.

1235
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,960
They have a deal on Game Pass where you can actually unlock

1236
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,360
all the new heroes instantly through the what's her name?

1237
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,200
The brand new one, Alari, the sun healer that just came out.

1238
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,400
I'm sorry if I butchered her name, I don't remember the moment

1239
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,960
I've played her like twice because I'm not very good with her.

1240
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,800
But you can get all of the heroes on Xbox Game Pass.

1241
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,320
Now you get it for the Xbox version of the game.

1242
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,840
But now that it's all linked together, you fire up the Xbox version of the game.

1243
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:44,200
And then guess what? It's all unlocked on the PC version of the game.

1244
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,920
So I actually got all the heroes that way.

1245
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,520
So I guess I've used my Game Pass subscription for that.

1246
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,280
But otherwise, I don't really give it money.

1247
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,320
But here's the thing, here's the point I really want to make.

1248
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:00,960
For me, this whole PvE thing is a very similar sort of situation to No Man's Sky.

1249
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:05,320
And what I mean by that is when No Man's Sky first came out,

1250
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:10,920
it rightfully took a beating from the gaming public because so much

1251
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:16,800
that was promised was not delivered on such as, oh, you multiplayer

1252
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,040
and that whole thing, right? Like, yeah, well, the odds are really low.

1253
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,880
You'd ever run into somebody in space.

1254
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,400
But maybe, you know, maybe you'll see it someday.

1255
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,400
And then that turned out that all that all was like a fucking lie.

1256
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,000
Like, like you would never actually others see people.

1257
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,120
But then they patched it in later.

1258
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,240
No Man's Sky got a lot of credit from the gaming public

1259
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:41,160
back by improving it consistently with patches.

1260
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,120
And it took a little while.

1261
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,040
But now No Man's Sky is coming up on its seven year anniversary as a game.

1262
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,320
And guess what? Guess what they teased on Twitter last week?

1263
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:55,160
Yet another patch coming for the game with more features and so forth.

1264
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,640
That's going to make the game even better.

1265
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,320
And as somebody who's a big fan now of No Man's Sky, I think that's awesome.

1266
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,040
So I think Blizzard should look to that as a model

1267
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,400
for how to turn Overwatch 2 around.

1268
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:12,320
Just fucking deliver like people will forgive you if you fucking deliver.

1269
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,600
But if you suddenly do the anthem thing

1270
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:22,120
and just shut it down, don't deliver back out and support,

1271
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,360
pull the plug, five dollars on the shelf at GameStop,

1272
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,480
then you're going to be you're going to be a laughing stock in history.

1273
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,920
I don't know if I don't think Overwatch 2 is really at that level of bad,

1274
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,280
but I think people will never be able to get past what was promised,

1275
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,880
you know, pre pandemic and so forth if Blizzard were to shut it down.

1276
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,640
But I don't see Blizzard doing that either.

1277
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,600
I feel like they're still just they're going to make it work one way or the other.

1278
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,360
But it's just it's going to take some of these verbal beatings online,

1279
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,320
but continuing to stick to the plan

1280
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:54,360
and making the game the best possible that it could be.

1281
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,360
Yeah, bonds 006 says, LOL,

1282
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,320
are you asking Blizzard to take notes how to improve a game in good faith?

1283
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1284
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,680
Well, although I understand what you're saying, I got two words for you.

1285
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:09,920
Diablo 3.

1286
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:16,520
Questbuster in chat says No Man's Sky was functional at launch

1287
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,280
and minimally viable enough to play with, but it was incredibly shallow.

1288
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:23,640
And this is from someone that actually completed a trip to the center of the galaxy.

1289
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,400
Today's No Man's Sky, though repeating what Rob is saying is pretty incredible stuff.

1290
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,360
Absolutely. You know, it'd be interesting.

1291
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:34,640
I got to I'm trying to find my disc copy of No Man's Sky

1292
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,360
because I have that original 1.0 version.

1293
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,280
I'd love to go back and play that again

1294
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,920
just to see how much has changed from the very beginning,

1295
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,200
because I bet it's pretty new.

1296
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,760
I think it would, because you can play it offline.

1297
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,960
You just pull the.

1298
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,400
I mean, I'd have to have I'd have to have a PS4 to play it on.

1299
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,240
But I could do mine. Yeah.

1300
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,640
So or just remove everything that's on my PS4.

1301
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,680
But yeah, anyway.

1302
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,120
Yeah. Questbuster says OMG, so much stuff is different.

1303
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,280
It'd really be interesting to see.

1304
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,520
I'm sure someone on YouTube's done it, but maybe I need to do it, too.

1305
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,600
We'll see. We'll see. Anyway.

1306
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,920
So, you know, I do you know, as somebody who wants to see Blizzard succeed

1307
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,080
eventually, like obviously I've had my criticisms of them as a company,

1308
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,920
and pretty much all of that can be traced to either people

1309
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,840
that are no longer with Blizzard or one particular Activision CEO

1310
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,600
who is continues to be a poison toxic individual in this industry

1311
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,560
that is long overstayed, is welcome and easy to get the fuck out of here.

1312
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:39,040
But unfortunately is hanging on for that separation fee.

1313
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,040
You know, that will inevitably come once this Microsoft merger goes through.

1314
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,240
But it's not a court case supposed to be coming up here soon.

1315
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,000
Like I thought it was at the end of this month.

1316
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,080
I think so. I think so.

1317
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,680
Maybe that's actually just apart from him.

1318
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,240
I also have problems with certain people

1319
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,440
that play that game that I don't want to associate with.

1320
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,360
All right, let's move on to our next story,

1321
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,280
which I think is me.

1322
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,600
Yes, it is. All right.

1323
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,840
So there's been a lot of talk about the Steam Deck.

1324
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,760
The Steam Deck is, of course,

1325
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:18,400
a physical hardware device that's been doing very well.

1326
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,040
And there's people like me that are like, you know,

1327
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,840
I'll be interested in getting a Steam Deck

1328
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,880
when they release a more powerful Steam Deck,

1329
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,640
because we know it's coming eventually, but not yet.

1330
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,320
But that hasn't because basically a Steam Deck is,

1331
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,720
you know, it's a PC device.

1332
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,520
It's not proprietary based stuff.

1333
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,960
We're seeing more competitors happen.

1334
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,880
And so now we're going to have one that's incoming from Lenovo.

1335
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,760
And some leaked images have revealed that the Lenovo Legion Go

1336
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,440
is part Steam Deck and part Nintendo Switch.

1337
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,320
When we talk about the removable little devices

1338
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,080
that click into the monitor, it's certainly that whole thing.

1339
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,320
So it was reported by Windows Central

1340
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:05,440
that Lenovo was working on a handheld gaming PC that runs Windows.

1341
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:09,800
Windows Report this week published the first images of the device,

1342
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,840
allegedly what it is, you know, could be an elaborate Photoshop.

1343
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,320
But I don't know. I don't know.

1344
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,800
This one looks like it could be pretty, pretty solid.

1345
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,120
Apparently, there is also one that shows that AR glasses

1346
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,960
could be working with the device as well.

1347
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,400
It could be something else that, you know, this this device is bringing.

1348
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,320
So we'll see.

1349
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,160
Apparently, the device has a kickstand similar to a Switch

1350
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,800
that you can use to lean the screen back

1351
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,520
so you can pick up the controllers and play as well.

1352
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:40,880
So it's really a little bit of a blend of the Switch and the Steam Deck.

1353
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:47,120
So, yeah, also, Lenovo is making the device pretty.

1354
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:51,240
It's it's kind of thick and, you know, it's it's it's got a lot to it.

1355
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:52,920
But I'm assuming that's to support,

1356
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:56,280
you know, battery life and power in that device and so forth.

1357
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:00,800
So the AR glasses in the report, supposedly part of an ecosystem

1358
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,640
that is going to be launched alongside the Legion Go.

1359
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:07,600
In the leaked promotional image, somebody wearing the glasses

1360
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,440
is looking at the game on a screen that's projected in midair.

1361
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,840
Who knows if this is something sold separately or a bundle?

1362
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,840
I would hope it's sold separately because you don't

1363
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,160
you don't want to bundle required hardware

1364
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,400
unless it is damn proven hardware like the Nintendo.

1365
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,600
We got away with it.

1366
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,760
It was central to that device.

1367
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,000
The Xbox one, when they bundled connect.

1368
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,840
Yeah, it didn't go so well.

1369
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,520
So just, you know, food for thought.

1370
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,080
The Legion Go will run Windows 11.

1371
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,000
So you should be able to run anything that runs on Windows 11,

1372
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,040
which is most games that you see on the Steam marketplace.

1373
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,320
That's for sure. So is it going to have any sort of though,

1374
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,280
like video out from it? Like.

1375
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,160
Does it say anything about that?

1376
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,000
That is a good question, because it didn't really say about like, does it?

1377
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,480
Does it pop into a dock or something like that?

1378
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,880
I'm not sure I see anything like that.

1379
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,320
I'm trying to look at the leaked image of the device to see if I see an output.

1380
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,400
And I don't see one in those pictures,

1381
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,160
but I also can't see the bottom of the device where it would logically be.

1382
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,960
So I can't rule it out yet.

1383
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,760
But again, while this is still a rumor,

1384
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,920
we're going to have to wait for the official announcement to know

1385
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,480
how would it hook up?

1386
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,400
Is it is there like a dock type of thing or just an HDMI output

1387
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,680
or something like that?

1388
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,360
We'd have to hear more about that.

1389
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,960
Yeah, same, same.

1390
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,600
So because I mean, I will.

1391
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,080
I mean, then again, I have a I have a reason now that I could get a steam

1392
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,880
because I mean, the biggest problem people are having with Steamdex

1393
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,800
as well was that not everything was Linux compatible. Mm hmm.

1394
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,880
You know, like that was what was holding me off from Dead by Daylight, for example.

1395
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,080
They've they've since put in that compatibility

1396
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,000
and a lot more games are compatible.

1397
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,160
I don't know if power would be.

1398
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,040
I mean, it's just a side note. Yeah.

1399
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,400
All right. Well, moving on to

1400
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,000
a really interesting story at our Sakura.

1401
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:09,120
So. I have to give some some preface to this.

1402
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:16,640
So there is a developer named Luke Bernard who released a game this year.

1403
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,080
It came out.

1404
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,640
I think it officially came out in June, July,

1405
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,400
that's called A Light in the Darkness, and in this game,

1406
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:32,760
you play as a French Jewish family in the years preceding and during the Holocaust.

1407
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:40,240
And it's it's it's a very realistic

1408
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,960
game for experience and it's free.

1409
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,880
But the he was, you know, sort of inspired

1410
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:52,040
to start the idea after he found out that his

1411
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,440
grandmother was part of the.

1412
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,920
British resistance that smuggled children out of

1413
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,240
out of Nazi occupied regions

1414
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,440
and that that he's Jewish by by maternal line.

1415
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:15,440
So at any rate,

1416
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,880
he started, you know, in trying to find places to get his game to go,

1417
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:26,320
you know, eventually was wanting to make sure that video games could be used

1418
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:32,200
as educational tools for keeping the history of this

1419
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:38,120
horrific event live in modern memory, you know, because our

1420
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,280
our survivors are almost all gone, you know.

1421
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,000
And so he

1422
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,200
is working with the the Fortnite people.

1423
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:58,800
And so now in in Fortnite, there is a Holocaust museum.

1424
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:04,960
And basically you can go in and see

1425
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:11,560
in a certain certain stories, you know, basically there was a lot of

1426
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:18,000
a lot of restrictions and different things that made it very difficult.

1427
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,720
But now there are certain stories that are being told

1428
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:30,080
through this sort of educational museum within the game.

1429
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,600
And so there there have been.

1430
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,920
Some people who are against it, who don't think that, you know,

1431
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,120
putting it in a video game, you know, would be best

1432
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,760
because it might trivialize it or that there's a thing to win.

1433
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,760
But, you know, there's other people who are like, yeah,

1434
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,720
you can tell a story through a game.

1435
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,160
And so that's, I think, a big step on this is having this sort of museum

1436
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,840
now inside a Fortnite.

1437
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,080
So can I can I say sorry?

1438
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,200
I just want to mention a hard pass on that perspective

1439
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,080
that this somehow trivializes it by putting it in Fortnite.

1440
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,680
I'm sorry, I see this as teaching the people that need to be taught

1441
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:17,040
this sort of stuff, meeting them where they are.

1442
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,600
That's that's what this is.

1443
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,600
This this really kind of speaks to me in a similar kind of capacity

1444
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,920
to how when we were young, you know, we would go to the computer lab

1445
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,720
on an Apple IIe and on Fridays we would play games.

1446
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,360
But on other days we might play something like, you know,

1447
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,080
the Oregon Trail or something where we were learning

1448
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,560
or even doing like simple logo, we're actually learning.

1449
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,280
Now, obviously, it was nothing learning about history in this regard.

1450
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,680
But I think we know that, you know, with Fortnite being this,

1451
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,240
you know, game engine and a lot of people, a lot of kids,

1452
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,400
especially around the age of Loki's kids, I would imagine they know Fortnite.

1453
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,080
They that's, you know, they don't like Fortnite, but they know interesting.

1454
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,200
I thought there were a lot of kids that do like Fortnite.

1455
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,240
But, you know, there are might not my kids.

1456
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:04,600
My kids are Roblox kids, unfortunately, Fortnite kids.

1457
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,880
But now they're like, they're too cool for Fortnite.

1458
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,160
But still, I think it's meeting a lot more.

1459
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,120
Yeah, OK, there's a lot more about it, though.

1460
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,960
So he's been trying to partner with the Anti-Defamation League,

1461
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,920
who have been very silent with him.

1462
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,000
And, you know.

1463
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,840
They're trying, they are working with the group Lost Tribe, though,

1464
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,760
for combating the casual anti-Semitism

1465
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,520
that you, you know, people encounter online, including in games.

1466
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,400
They have found so much anti-Semitism

1467
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,440
just rampant on Discord, on Twitch,

1468
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,920
even incorporated into game storylines,

1469
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:59,760
although I guess not consciously, you know, it's just this

1470
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,760
built in culture.

1471
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,360
And, you know, they're trying to,

1472
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,720
you know, they even, you know, he's even talking about,

1473
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,480
you know, trying to get Activision to make changes.

1474
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,400
That, you know, because Call of Duty has especially big anti-Semitic community.

1475
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,400
And so going on further, though,

1476
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,360
is that this Fortnite museum

1477
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:35,280
have basically their on-screen

1478
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,800
communication tools are disabled.

1479
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,720
They cannot manipulate the environment at all.

1480
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:49,280
They are basically making it like a real museum you go in.

1481
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,200
And so.

1482
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,760
There are, you know.

1483
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,080
Like this is one on here, it's basically

1484
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,560
the CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, of ADL

1485
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:14,040
was saying that it could be potentially worthwhile.

1486
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,360
But he goes on to say, and I'm going to read a quote,

1487
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,800
until the game industry can change the norms of hate and abuse

1488
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,080
in online multiplayer games, we cannot view experiences like these

1489
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,480
as a true alternative to more traditional forms of Holocaust education.

1490
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,680
But it's something it's doing something right.

1491
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,160
I understand the frustration and the comment.

1492
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:36,040
And I don't want to say, like, I outright disagree with it.

1493
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,360
But I would encourage that person to kind of take the alternate perspective of,

1494
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,160
again, sometimes you have to meet the people where they are.

1495
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:45,120
And it's that kind of thing where, you know, by going to Fortnite

1496
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,000
and showing, you know, people like when you use that language,

1497
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,320
that's this is what it means.

1498
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,280
You know, this is what it really is.

1499
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,360
And actually, you know, something to keep in the back of our minds.

1500
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,960
This is not the first time Fortnite has taken on a very serious topic

1501
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,800
like this with a educational museum interactive experience.

1502
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,240
It was just I think it was a couple of years ago,

1503
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,760
but there was the whole Martin Luther King March for Time thing

1504
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,200
that came right around that time of, you know, a lot of the

1505
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:13,520
racial, you know, injustice, you know, talks that were happening in this country.

1506
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,800
We saw that experience open up at Fortnite and to what I believe anyway,

1507
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:23,160
maybe, maybe naively so, but was a lot of very positive,

1508
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,600
sort of like this is a really cool thing to see that Fortnite is doing

1509
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,680
and able to show that.

1510
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:32,600
So I hope I hope folks

1511
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,160
that have a little say and pull and looking at where they do

1512
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,040
and they don't partner can take a look at things like that

1513
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:43,640
and maybe the impact it's had and how it could be useful for something like this, too.

1514
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,520
Well, and see that some of the things that go in there,

1515
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,720
I mean, there is some stuff that like is like right from Wikipedia.

1516
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,560
But there's there's other things going on,

1517
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,280
just like some of the lesser known tales of resistance,

1518
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,080
you know, spotlighting aspects of the Dutch resistance, for example.

1519
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:12,440
You know, just very various, you know, different different things that are

1520
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,480
the stories you don't hear every day.

1521
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,880
You know what I mean? Right.

1522
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:23,080
And now, as far as his game, The Light in the Darkness,

1523
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,720
it is available for free on Epic.

1524
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,120
I didn't check Steam yet.

1525
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,280
I found a completely different game with the same name,

1526
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,520
but it's on PS5.

1527
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,400
It's on different consoles and it is free.

1528
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,800
And he went from trying to tell like, you know,

1529
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:47,600
oh, the little kid, unrealistic view to actually you are living this event

1530
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,040
and it doesn't end well.

1531
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:52,680
You know, so sort of, you know,

1532
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:59,360
this is the extreme end of what your harmful words can lead to.

1533
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,240
Don't repeat it.

1534
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,840
I really love this comment from QuestBuster in our chat over

1535
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,360
twitch.tv slash vog network.

1536
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,000
QuestBuster says, I always applaud efforts like this.

1537
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,320
The medium has always played to its strengths in creative ways

1538
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,320
from Oregon Trail to titles like This War of Mine

1539
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,600
to efforts like those in Assassin's Creed, Origin and Valhalla

1540
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,480
as history walkabouts to perhaps inspire someone out there to simply ask,

1541
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,400
hey, is there a way to know more?

1542
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:34,440
Yeah, I actually I've had the game on my my radar for a little bit.

1543
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,640
As soon as I can figure out a good way to play it, I totally will.

1544
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,280
But I'm I'm pretty

1545
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,280
I'm just excited that the Fortnite folks have gone along with this, too,

1546
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:52,760
that they're they're in there to have some real education

1547
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,520
going on in a silly game that has a llama for a mascot.

1548
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:01,920
You know, and and and I've I've had this discussion

1549
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,800
actually with a coworker as far as, you know, talking about training material.

1550
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:10,440
And there's a really good book out there called The Gamification of Training.

1551
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,080
But I look at the same thing as also training, education,

1552
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,720
presenting things, because some people will learn better

1553
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,000
by participating in a thing.

1554
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,560
And if you can offer this up in a virtual environment

1555
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,760
and have someone participate with the game or with the content,

1556
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,920
you know, having it in an interactable, you know, area

1557
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,160
that I think that it cements those those stories in people's minds again

1558
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,680
and keeps it in the the modern consciousness

1559
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,160
before we lose the people who've who lived it.

1560
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,760
Philanine in our chat says, I think it's cool,

1561
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,440
but it's kind of like handing out copies of the Barbie movie

1562
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,680
at an NRA convention.

1563
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,920
I understand disagree.

1564
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,560
I understand the perspective to an extent.

1565
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,360
However, there's something to be said about

1566
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,920
when they kind of strip out some of the multiplayer

1567
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,360
and some of the essentially what leads to group think

1568
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,520
and the reason why people behave like asshats online

1569
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:18,120
is to, you know, try to get a rise, impress, do things with other people.

1570
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,680
When you kind of take the interactions with other people out of it

1571
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,560
and in these particular experiences, even though they're in a multiplayer

1572
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,000
environment, you are left with you

1573
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,160
and the facts, the history, the exhibits, the evidence.

1574
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,640
And you have the chance to have some self-reflection

1575
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,680
with those sorts of things.

1576
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,240
Is that going to work with everybody?

1577
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,920
Absolutely not.

1578
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,200
But could it succeed in reaching through to a couple of people

1579
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,360
and making them think differently when they're confronted with

1580
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,880
the actual history and the evidence of what these sorts of things have led to?

1581
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:55,400
It's worth trying.

1582
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,920
It's worth it's worth trying.

1583
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,040
You know what it takes, I think, to dismantle any kind of bigotry,

1584
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,120
hatred like that, even casually.

1585
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,000
Mm hmm. Hey, that's not cool.

1586
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,120
Mm hmm. One person saying, hey, that's not cool. That's right.

1587
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,000
Or I'd appreciate if you didn't say that around me. That's right.

1588
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:18,320
You know, it requires one person

1589
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,560
to be brave enough to think for themselves.

1590
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:27,040
And tell their buddies, I don't appreciate it, and if they're their friends,

1591
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,720
there's not going to be a problem.

1592
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,720
And, you know, and I'll even put it this way, and this might be

1593
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,960
just my perspective from, you know, lots of different crap

1594
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,680
I personally live through, but.

1595
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,480
It it's easy to be the sheep.

1596
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,440
It's harder to be the wolf.

1597
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:50,440
You know, also, now that I'm sitting here really thinking about it,

1598
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,760
and again, I don't want to sound like I'm picking on the listener

1599
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,240
because I completely understand where this comment comes from. I do.

1600
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,960
But it's it's when I when I look at the whole like it's handing out copies,

1601
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,960
the Barbie movie at NRA convention.

1602
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,240
Isn't the opposite true?

1603
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:07,360
Don't they? Isn't the opposite actively happening?

1604
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,280
Because I was thinking about I was at the mall

1605
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,440
and I was doing the whole Pokemon Go thing.

1606
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,720
There was a little table set up of a certain religious affiliation

1607
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,400
that was just sitting there waiting to answer any questions.

1608
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,120
And I you know, I got to think like they sit there all day with that damn table.

1609
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,240
Does anyone actually come up and talk to them like, hey, yes,

1610
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,520
I'm interested in that religion that you go door to door pedaling anyway.

1611
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,480
They wouldn't do it if it didn't work at least once. Right.

1612
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,960
And on top of that, on top of that, again, to continue this analogy,

1613
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,280
as I was walking back to my car, I was walking, you know, past

1614
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:43,800
like the Starbucks, the Macy's, I get stopped by this guy.

1615
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,640
And I'm not going to lie, he was an attractive younger.

1616
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,240
When I say younger, I mean like mid 20s.

1617
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,440
Remember, I'm in my 40s now.

1618
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:54,680
Younger and younger guy that was like, hey, you just like

1619
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,440
I just felt like an energy from you.

1620
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,480
I just wanted to say hello to you.

1621
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:03,320
And I was like, and my honest to God, my my brain was like,

1622
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,400
did did my fat thumb activate Grindr in this mall or something?

1623
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,080
Like, why is this person like why is this person like randomly?

1624
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,520
I'm not going to lie.

1625
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:16,520
I'm fairly attractive Latino guy walking up to me, talking to me. Right.

1626
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,960
And cutie. Yeah.

1627
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,720
But but then here's here's the punch line.

1628
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,480
And so I go, you know, because I'm kind of like deer in headlights.

1629
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,960
I'm like, thanks. Yeah.

1630
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,400
Cool. What's up?

1631
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,320
You know, type of thing.

1632
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:33,520
He's like, I just wanted to know, is there is there anything I can pray for you now?

1633
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,400
Is it can I pray for you?

1634
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,600
Yeah, there you go. There's the punch line, right?

1635
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,840
Can I can I is there anything I can pray for you?

1636
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,320
And I don't know what I'm going to say. I'm gonna be honest.

1637
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,680
I don't know what it was about the moment, but I was like,

1638
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:47,840
I didn't feel like being the guy that just wanted to say, like,

1639
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,000
you know, roll my eyes and say fuck off and walk away.

1640
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,080
I didn't really want to do that.

1641
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:55,040
So I just said I said, I said, you know, if it'll if it'll make this

1642
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,800
mildly attractive man happy, I'm going to say, yes.

1643
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,200
You know what?

1644
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,600
My my dad is actually having an investigative procedure right now.

1645
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,600
So if you want to keep him in your thoughts, I'd appreciate that. Right.

1646
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,840
I said that. And he said he said, I I will do that.

1647
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,400
He said, I'm going to do that for you.

1648
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,680
And I just want you to know God loves you.

1649
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,000
And I say I just kind of now and I'm really deer in the headlights.

1650
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,520
I smile because what am I supposed to say?

1651
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:23,760
I think I'm supposed to say I love God, too, or whatever. I don't know.

1652
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,600
But I just said I said, oh, OK.

1653
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,000
And he goes, you know that, right? God loves you.

1654
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,560
And I just smiled and I looked at him dead in the eye and I said,

1655
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,440
it's complicated. And I walked away.

1656
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,120
Yeah. How was it?

1657
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,640
I take the approach outlined by Margaret

1658
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,200
Tres mother and I apply it to many situations.

1659
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:49,400
Don't punch. Say thank you.

1660
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,360
Yeah. You know who else loves you?

1661
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,360
Rob Starfish loves you.

1662
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,160
You know who loves me?

1663
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,640
My cat when I'm feeding her.

1664
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,320
But I'm just can can we have more middle aged attractive men?

1665
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,920
All right. Anyway, I guess

1666
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:15,600
I'm just yes, I yes, I'm married.

1667
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,560
But, you know, we all like attention.

1668
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,960
All right. Moving on.

1669
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,560
What do we have next?

1670
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,160
I think we're over to Loki, right?

1671
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:29,520
Yes. Yes. So this is eight strikes.

1672
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,440
You're out because, you know, three, that's too little.

1673
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,240
Let's give you eight warnings before we kick you off the Xbox platform

1674
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,760
for only a year.

1675
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,040
So they do.

1676
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:46,200
Yeah. So basically now they have this new system.

1677
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,400
They were already doing these different enforcements before.

1678
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,720
But now if you get eight, there's they're kind of

1679
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,560
drawing the equivalent to like the license system

1680
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,760
like your driver's license, where if you get points on your driver's license,

1681
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,040
then certain things happen like you certain restrictions.

1682
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,520
So, for example, you know, with the first point, you get a warning.

1683
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,160
If you get three points, you're going to be, you know, off the platform

1684
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,680
for, you know, seven days.

1685
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,160
You keep doing that, then you're going to be off for a year.

1686
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,120
And points will fall off of the person's record after six months.

1687
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,120
I think it's too much, though.

1688
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,000
I think that they should do it permanently.

1689
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,080
Honestly, DMV, Jesus, like, well, not the DMV, but like, yeah,

1690
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,160
the rolling point window and all this.

1691
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,760
Well, yeah. So they say, you know what, you know what?

1692
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,000
If you commit too many offenses on Xbox,

1693
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
you should have to go to the equivalent of traffic school.

1694
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,600
But for Xbox Live, you should have to go.

1695
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,320
Yeah, you have to go to etiquette school to comedy.

1696
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:53,480
Stop saying slurs on the Internet school.

1697
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,200
That's that's what you need to do.

1698
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,360
Just like violating.

1699
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,360
Pretty funny. Too many.

1700
01:31:58,360 --> 01:32:00,840
You're going to do the same thing that I do with traffic school,

1701
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:03,080
and that's just test out.

1702
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:08,120
Yeah, so that's the thing that they have now.

1703
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:12,080
Just, you know, honestly, I think the year is not long enough.

1704
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,000
I mean, if you're you're getting eight violations within six months,

1705
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,440
electric, that's a you.

1706
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:19,600
That's a you problem.

1707
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,640
So like, you know, obviously.

1708
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,040
Well, you just change your behavior.

1709
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,880
Don't be like this.

1710
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,760
Oh, my God. This comment from SSJ 100, Matt,

1711
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:33,240
maybe I'm not under maybe I'm not understanding it well,

1712
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,160
but it kind of feels like a Wendy's pick a menu.

1713
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:42,280
I could say cheat three times and do hate speech twice before getting banned

1714
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:46,680
or commit hate speech twice and do some harassment once.

1715
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:48,760
It just seems convoluted.

1716
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,560
Why give someone another chance to do hate speech?

1717
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,840
Why give a person another two or three times to hurt someone?

1718
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,320
I get what they're trying to do, but I feel not every

1719
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,160
every situation fits into a fancy sliding scale.

1720
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,320
And I'm sorry to be laughing at this, you know, because these these situations

1721
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,320
are not funny. Yeah, but yes, the Wendy's pick a menu of it all

1722
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:12,080
and like trying to put these into like literal buckets of, you know,

1723
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,320
how bad is the crime is kind of humorous.

1724
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,560
You know, it's just the whole system is a little strange.

1725
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,280
I am thinking of one particular situation, though,

1726
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:26,840
and that would be like what of, you know, children who,

1727
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:29,640
you know, get a little bit more maturity over the course of a year.

1728
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,200
And maybe that's why they have the rolling window.

1729
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,760
Yeah, perhaps.

1730
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:41,200
I do think I'm thinking of I do think with any discipline system online,

1731
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:44,640
there ought to be a valid appeal method, you know.

1732
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:47,600
And if the appeal method is

1733
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:52,240
I went to to traffic school and test it out and learn better.

1734
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:53,200
I know how to do that.

1735
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,840
Then, you know, I think somebody should be given another chance.

1736
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,000
But someone told me not to be in thinking.

1737
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,760
No one's ever told me that before.

1738
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,400
To quote Dwight's truth.

1739
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,160
That's a demerit. Three demerits.

1740
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,600
You'll receive a citation, five citations, and you're looking at a violation.

1741
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,160
Four of those.

1742
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,680
And you'll receive a verbal warning.

1743
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:14,520
Keep it up. And you're looking at a written warning.

1744
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:15,480
Two of those.

1745
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:18,920
That'll land you in a world of hurt in the form of a disciplinary review

1746
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:22,560
written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.

1747
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,120
Perfect. And on that note,

1748
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:34,400
let's go back to a time when, you know, there was no there was no point system.

1749
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,160
If you fucked up, mom took the cord to your system.

1750
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:38,360
That's what happens.

1751
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,960
Let's go to the next segment.

1752
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:54,320
And now it's time to travel back to a simpler time or I'll dive

1753
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:57,800
into the vault and pull out a classic and tell you about it.

1754
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,880
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1755
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,920
And what did you pick tonight, Dark Sakura?

1756
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,480
I teethed this earlier.

1757
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,560
I picked Nightmare in the Dark.

1758
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:14,320
So Nightmare in the Dark is a platform

1759
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,360
arcade game that was developed by AM factory.

1760
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,960
You know what, I'm stupid because I picked a game.

1761
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,480
Never mind, I'm not stupid.

1762
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:24,960
I take that back.

1763
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,000
It came out in 2000.

1764
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,800
And for just a moment, my brain rewinded itself in time and was like,

1765
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,840
that wasn't yeah, it was more than 10 years ago.

1766
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:36,280
So anyway, it was developed by AM factory.

1767
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:41,040
Also assisted by PALN and it was released by Eleven

1768
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:45,280
slash Gather King on January 27th, 2000,

1769
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,200
except it wasn't actually released.

1770
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,520
It never got an official release for either the Neo Geo AES,

1771
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,880
the home version or Neo Geo CD platforms.

1772
01:35:55,800 --> 01:36:00,600
It's the story of a gravekeeper

1773
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,360
who finds that his graves are being desecrated

1774
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,040
and he's trying to stop the grave robbers.

1775
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:10,160
So this game.

1776
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,440
Actually, I take that back.

1777
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:17,720
It did get released on Neo Geo MVS, but there was no home release.

1778
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,160
I mean, which is stupid because if it was MVS,

1779
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,640
it would have been easy to do AES.

1780
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,080
But anyway, anyway.

1781
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,880
So basically, it's it's Bubble Bobble

1782
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,120
slash Snow Brothers, the goth version.

1783
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:33,080
So you play the little gravekeeper

1784
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,320
and you have to

1785
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:40,520
go around and and throw fire from your lantern

1786
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:42,920
at these different enemies and eventually turn them

1787
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:46,720
into a big ball of fire that you can throw at enemies.

1788
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,360
Basically, you have to have the biggest balls of them all.

1789
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:54,200
And of course, they roll through the level and destroy things

1790
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,560
and you get goodies for everything your big balls destroy.

1791
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,200
And then they release.

1792
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,080
Yeah, that power at the moment that they're destroyed.

1793
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:09,320
But unlike in Snow Brothers, you don't get all beneficial items.

1794
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,800
You'll get some detrimental ones,

1795
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,840
like things that strip away your powers and stuff like that.

1796
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,200
And then at the end of the fourth level, you have a boss fight.

1797
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:25,200
And then you get these big bursts of of items released by the boss.

1798
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:31,920
One of them is it looks like meat on the bone, and that is an extra life.

1799
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,760
It only comes out with the the defeat of the boss.

1800
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,440
But at any rate,

1801
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,960
it's a fun game, it gets pretty challenging,

1802
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,360
but I like the aesthetic of it, honestly, I found it

1803
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,720
to be a lot more fun than Snow Brothers or Bubble Bobble

1804
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:58,280
because it's cute, but scary.

1805
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:04,200
So there's an official story that you see at the start of the game,

1806
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,040
and I want to I want to read it, if no one minds.

1807
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:11,840
Go for it. There lived one grave watcher

1808
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,760
with magical power at a very small village in a remote region.

1809
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:21,000
He lived a quiet, solitary life in the corner of the cemetery.

1810
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:25,280
He kept away from the village people due to his very ugly appearance.

1811
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,280
Well, the village people are stupid, I'm kidding.

1812
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:33,240
One day he found the graves were being ransacked and some corpses were stolen.

1813
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,520
He didn't want the village people to find out,

1814
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,960
so he decided to eliminate the grave burglars by himself.

1815
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:42,760
Thus, he patrolled the cemetery every night.

1816
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,200
He found out that a powerful wizard has been stealing the corpses

1817
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:50,280
to build his army of undead to terrorize the village.

1818
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:54,640
He then took it upon himself to eliminate the wizard once and for all.

1819
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,480
And then there's one more line that I think is from the end of the game.

1820
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:03,520
After defeating the wizard, he returns to his solitary life.

1821
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,440
Eventually, the villagers find out about his bravery

1822
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:08,560
and protecting them from the menace of the wizard

1823
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,960
and go to his house and express their gratitude to him.

1824
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,960
And and actually, funny enough, this year,

1825
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:22,880
Time Extension said that this was one of the best games ever for the Neo Geo.

1826
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:28,120
There you go.

1827
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,520
All right. It's a cute game.

1828
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,240
I love it. It's got a cute style to it.

1829
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,760
I like the whole like Halloween, Halloween, Snow Brothers type of thing.

1830
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:41,720
Oh, yeah. That second boss, though,

1831
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:46,440
it's like a giant skull on like built into a motorcycle. Mm hmm.

1832
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,920
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1833
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,760
It's just that that one was a pain in the ass.

1834
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:55,480
The other ones were like a cakewalk compared to that one, even the twin ones.

1835
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,920
And I played a significant amount of this

1836
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:03,080
on one of the candy cabs at California Extreme yesterday.

1837
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,720
All right. Your classic game of the week, Nightmare in the Dark.

1838
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,320
Let me just say, Dark Soccer, I appreciate you picking a Halloween game in August.

1839
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,880
I really do, especially with the rumor that pumpkin spice lattes

1840
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:18,120
are returning next week and fall is creeping back more and more and more.

1841
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,520
And I, for one, could not be happier because you know what?

1842
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,960
Christmas has been cutting into the Halloween season for far too long.

1843
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:27,360
So you know what? Summer Halloween deserves this moment.

1844
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,040
Suck it. It is now fall. Yeah.

1845
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,280
And honestly, though, I'm just

1846
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,200
at the grocery store.

1847
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:41,160
The Starbucks brand already has their Keurig

1848
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,280
pumpkin spice.

1849
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:48,640
I posted an Instagram story this week as we were at Target

1850
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,600
and I saw my first pumpkin spice.

1851
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,320
It was the same thing.

1852
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:53,440
It was their store brand.

1853
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,520
I can't remember the name of it, but Target's in store brand

1854
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,520
of the pumpkin spice decaf and gather actually good and gather

1855
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,360
whatever it's called.

1856
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,240
Good and plenty like the candy.

1857
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,840
The pumpkin spice decaf as well.

1858
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:07,440
So, oh, I don't usually see the fun flavors and decaf.

1859
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,640
So had to get some of those.

1860
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:13,280
So now DJ says fall is not until September 22nd.

1861
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,040
Stay in your lane, Rob.

1862
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,320
To that, I say suck it.

1863
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,320
Hater, is this is the spirit store open or not open?

1864
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,880
The spirits that go check.

1865
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:27,160
Oh, not go check your local abandoned former department store.

1866
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,680
No, we've got one right around the corner from us.

1867
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,560
But they're not open yet.

1868
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,680
They have the signs out.

1869
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,960
I need to check.

1870
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,960
So I need to check where the where the sports chalet was,

1871
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,640
because that's where our spirit is out here by Joanne's,

1872
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:44,600
which is funny to have the spirit and Joanne next to each other,

1873
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:48,160
because then I can just like be everywhere I need and stock up

1874
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:51,240
on future cosplay stuff and decorations for my house year round.

1875
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:54,280
Alan and I are trying to figure out what we want to dress up as well.

1876
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:56,040
We know what we want to dress up as for ugly.

1877
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:59,440
But we want to figure out, like, should we just do the costumes in a bag

1878
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,120
or like, how can we make it more interesting?

1879
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,400
So it can be something that reminds me.

1880
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:07,280
I've decided what my second cosplay is going to be for TwitchCon.

1881
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:10,000
Hmm. Pigmeg.

1882
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,320
Oh, pigmeg. How funny. My Meg.

1883
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,680
You know, it's funny.

1884
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:17,720
Intoxicated and I use exactly the same cosmetic for our megs.

1885
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,720
Independently of each other.

1886
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:24,000
That's funny. Are they coming again to TwitchCon?

1887
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,240
Yeah. Fine. Yeah.

1888
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:27,280
I'm not even sure.

1889
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,560
I'm not even sure who's going to tell this year.

1890
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,680
Oh, I know. I know.

1891
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,520
I haven't heard of Elsie's going, which I really hope so.

1892
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,240
But I think in a while, I think they've went on a break.

1893
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,840
Yeah. Yeah. But I think,

1894
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:45,080
well, he's living his best vtuber life.

1895
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:49,360
But I know Nick is going.

1896
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,640
Cam is going.

1897
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,960
I think we're going to have Le Pen.

1898
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,960
I think we're going to have has like your usual.

1899
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:58,240
I think we're going to have like all the usuals.

1900
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,880
But I think there's a few people who still aren't going to be able to make it,

1901
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:05,160
because I think that that Rokum's isn't going to make it.

1902
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,000
So I'm a little sad.

1903
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,600
I think the Vegas hotel prices are a little off putting

1904
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:10,280
for some part of the problem.

1905
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:12,920
Yeah, I'm staying with Tiara.

1906
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:15,240
We oh, that'll be fun.

1907
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,000
I hope to see them at some point.

1908
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,120
Actually, we need to like do a dinner or something.

1909
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,880
We'll be there the day before and leave the day after.

1910
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,960
I'd love to see Tiara.

1911
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:23,720
I'll bring it up.

1912
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:26,680
Yeah, we had some we had some plans to go like

1913
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,240
go to the Pinball Museum.

1914
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,440
So oh, fuck yeah.

1915
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,480
Heck yeah.

1916
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:37,440
Uh, God, Alan said he maybe wants to go see the RuPaul's Drag Race show again.

1917
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,280
And I was like, really?

1918
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:39,960
It wasn't that good the first time.

1919
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:44,200
But I'll do I'll do things my husband wants to do because I'm nice.

1920
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,320
Well, I wanted to what I wanted to do that I was down.

1921
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,520
I tried to get us reservations

1922
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,840
at the Hell Kitchen restaurant for Thursday when we get in.

1923
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,520
And nope, if I wanted to if we wanted a reservation there,

1924
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,360
it had to be like 11 o'clock at night.

1925
01:43:56,360 --> 01:43:58,200
Jeez. Yeah.

1926
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,200
Phil of nine in chat says, was it bad, Rob?

1927
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,280
I still need to see that.

1928
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,000
Honestly, just go see the local queens at a show like it.

1929
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,200
It's just it's better and more organic.

1930
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,480
I didn't like the whole like overproducedness of it.

1931
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:14,960
And I thought it was if if you like the musicals on Drag Race, you'll like it.

1932
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:19,400
If you think the musicals on Drag Race are ridiculous competitions,

1933
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,840
then like me, you're not going to like it.

1934
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,680
So it's your taste may vary. Hmm.

1935
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,840
Uh, Tara said definitely.

1936
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1937
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:31,800
I was interacting with him on Blue Sky and kind of hinted at it.

1938
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,280
So Phil of nine says I might go see the Drag Race show

1939
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,120
when I go see the Kylie residency.

1940
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:37,120
Kylie?

1941
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,920
Yeah, Kylie's doing a residency at the Venetian.

1942
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,080
Not not in October, but well, maybe, but not that weekend.

1943
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,120
I want to go so bad.

1944
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,920
But, you know, it's sold out like 30 minutes.

1945
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,640
But the rumor is she's going to add more dates

1946
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:51,960
in the middle of next year.

1947
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:54,640
And I might do it if they add more more dates.

1948
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,200
I might. But yeah. Oh, my God.

1949
01:44:56,200 --> 01:45:00,640
They they are fucking fleecing the gays for that Kylie thing

1950
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:03,920
because it's like the tickets for the show and then like the

1951
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,520
the dinner tickets and the minimum drink tickets.

1952
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:08,560
It's like, oh, my God.

1953
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,600
No, I feel at night I heard they were going to add more on top of that.

1954
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,520
So we'll see like.

1955
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,440
I love Kylie. I know me, too.

1956
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:19,960
I'd love to go see it, but I just. Yeah.

1957
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:23,200
Anyway, I had actually kind of an embarrassing moment

1958
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,080
yesterday at the convention because I was I was, you know,

1959
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:32,240
touching up my makeup and I love it was on in the background music.

1960
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,600
And I'm singing along doing my face.

1961
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:37,520
And this lady looks over is like, you love this song, don't you?

1962
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,560
I was like, it's Kylie.

1963
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,400
Of course, I love this song. That was it.

1964
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,720
That was a conversation.

1965
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:46,880
Every every time my friend and I go to because one of my friends

1966
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:51,800
I play Overwatch with actually here locally, I will go out to the bar.

1967
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,720
We like to go to the bolt sometimes.

1968
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:58,680
And every time because he drinks, he taught me how to install

1969
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,120
the touch to these on my phone.

1970
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:03,840
So when we go, I always say, OK, I'm going to put them on.

1971
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,080
So and usually after like three hours,

1972
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:11,640
it will finally come on because gays and controlling music.

1973
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:14,440
Let me tell you. Mm hmm.

1974
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:18,040
All right. You know, whether that's still not even my favorite Kylie song.

1975
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,880
No, it's not my favorite either, but it's it's so like

1976
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,280
it's a song that is still my favorite.

1977
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,360
You can't help but smile.

1978
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,360
Yeah. That's the thing. And drive really fast, too. Oops.

1979
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:30,960
Maybe I'm just like super contemporary,

1980
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,560
but I really think my favorite Kylie song is Say Something.

1981
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,920
I love that song.

1982
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:37,440
Like it just it always lifts up my mood.

1983
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,840
It has such a such a lovely musical melody to it.

1984
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:41,960
And the harmonies are beautiful.

1985
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:42,960
Anyway, I get it.

1986
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,360
Anyway, next on Kylie Lounge Radio.

1987
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:49,720
It sets off my synesthesia in a good way. Yes. All right.

1988
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:52,880
KylieCon. Yes.

1989
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:58,520
In Australia, unfortunately. All right.

1990
01:46:58,520 --> 01:47:02,520
Moving on, let's talk about some other news in the gaming industry

1991
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,720
with some rapid fire news.

1992
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:07,000
Loki. Yep.

1993
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,520
So Steam Remote Play is getting an upgrade.

1994
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:13,720
They're going to be enabling for case streaming now.

1995
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,240
So that's pretty sweet.

1996
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:19,320
I just grabbed the beta client of Steam to be able to try that out.

1997
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,480
Neat. I haven't done remote play.

1998
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:27,400
I have a like one of those

1999
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,480
that's what they call it.

2000
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:31,880
It's not Steam Deck, Steam Box, Steam streaming thing.

2001
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:34,680
I don't know. I haven't tried that ever since they got it, but

2002
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,120
that might be fun.

2003
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:41,480
We'll see. And then there's a rumor, of course, that Keanu Reeves

2004
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,880
is in Death Stranding 2.

2005
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:47,280
This is coming from Instagram where Hideo Kojima posted a picture of

2006
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:51,280
none other than Norman Reedus sitting next to Keanu Reeves.

2007
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,680
And well, why would they be together and Hideo Kojima posting about it?

2008
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,640
Maybe we'll have to find out, I guess.

2009
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:04,120
That sounds like a Game Awards type of an announcement.

2010
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:06,600
Doesn't it? Doesn't it sound like the type of thing that was arranged

2011
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,120
backstage at the Game Awards? Like totally does.

2012
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:14,320
Yeah, that that totally sounds like a thing that we'll see in a few months.

2013
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,160
All right. Darsakra.

2014
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:22,240
Well, Alan Wake News, Alan Wake 2

2015
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:25,880
has been delayed by ten days.

2016
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,560
Ten whole days. Ten whole days.

2017
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:31,840
More like Alan Wait.

2018
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,800
It will be out on October 27th.

2019
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:40,840
And it's not really related to like giving them time to to, you know,

2020
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:46,200
polish up the date as I think it's just the quote is saying.

2021
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,760
That we hope this date shift gives more space

2022
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,880
for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.

2023
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:56,320
So meaning I think it's going to be to allow a buffer time

2024
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:00,640
between the majority of releases to then bring out their game.

2025
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,760
I think what

2026
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:06,240
isn't that around?

2027
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:09,440
Call it at ease, I think, coming out in November, unless they bumped it up

2028
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,280
earlier, but there is some big games in October.

2029
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,800
Yeah, it's just like Assassin's Creed or something like that.

2030
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:16,080
Yeah, Assassin's Creed is.

2031
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,280
Well, I mean, I should probably just look at the list.

2032
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,680
It's right in front of me anyway. So that's true.

2033
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:22,680
We are about to move into release dates.

2034
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:24,160
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

2035
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,480
Only a few things coming out in the 20th.

2036
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,080
So Marvel's Spider-Man, too, and Super Mario Wonder.

2037
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:32,840
Just a couple of small games, you know, like it's it's no big deal.

2038
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,440
It's no big deal.

2039
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,240
The Metal Gear Solid remaster.

2040
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,120
All right. All right. All right.

2041
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:41,160
But if I can finish. Sure. Please.

2042
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:45,120
I know we already derailed it with Kylie, we could just talk about more Kylie.

2043
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,680
Finish your damn story.

2044
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:52,760
But the tweet from their official Twitter account,

2045
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,840
I'm not calling it anything but Twitter.

2046
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,920
An update from the Alan Wake 2 team.

2047
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:00,520
We're moving Alan Wake 2's launch from October 17th to October 27th.

2048
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:04,560
October is an amazing month for game launches, and we hope this date shift.

2049
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,720
And here's the rest of the quote.

2050
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:08,200
Gives more space for everyone to enjoy their favorite games.

2051
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:12,080
We can't wait to show you what everyone's favorite novelist is up to

2052
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,960
in the dark place next week.

2053
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,280
Thanks for your patience.

2054
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:18,320
So there's going to be more news coming out.

2055
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,480
I'll put a link to the tweet in the in the chat tweet.

2056
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,480
All right. Tweet. Not.

2057
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,720
Yeah, not anything else. All right.

2058
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:30,280
No, I didn't hear anything. No one said anything.

2059
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,560
Moving on to this story.

2060
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:35,680
Jeff Keeley is basically saying in regards to opening night

2061
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:39,720
live at Gamescom, lower your expectations.

2062
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,080
I'm paraphrasing, but that's what I'm hearing in this whole thing is that

2063
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,880
do not expect gigantic game announcements in this whole thing.

2064
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:48,040
But maybe it's a mind trick.

2065
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,560
Maybe he's saying that because there's going to be a big announcement.

2066
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:51,680
OK, I don't think so.

2067
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,760
Just, you know, lower the bar.

2068
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,440
Here's what he is saying.

2069
01:50:55,440 --> 01:51:00,560
And this is only like two days away, actually, because it's opening night live.

2070
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,840
But it's like 11 a.m.

2071
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,800
for us, because obviously it's happening in Germany.

2072
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:06,040
So time zones, lol.

2073
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:09,840
But the event is happening on August 22nd.

2074
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,440
And in a statement, actually, no, I'm sorry.

2075
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,840
This was an interview with VGC.

2076
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:18,760
Jeff Keeley said it's going to be an exciting show with new looks

2077
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,240
at many announced upcoming games like Alan Wake 2 and Black Myth Wukong.

2078
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:28,160
This year's ONL is less about announcing brand new projects

2079
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:32,520
and more about giving fans updates on some of the biggest games

2080
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,720
due out over the next year.

2081
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,880
Haven't I given you nerds enough?

2082
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:40,200
No, I added that last line myself, but I just I just

2083
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:42,680
he should have said that.

2084
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:45,120
Jeff, if you're highly hiring a publicist, I'm available.

2085
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:50,800
Just saying. Anyhow, the last time I think they actually had.

2086
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:52,640
Oh, the last one was in person.

2087
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:54,600
So this one will also be in person.

2088
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,720
But obviously there was there was a break there.

2089
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,400
Last year's show was two hours and ran 35 games.

2090
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,240
But I don't know.

2091
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,360
They're not saying exactly how long this one is,

2092
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:09,160
but I'm sure folks will be paying attention on Tuesday morning.

2093
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,600
So we'll see if anything new maybe does get gets announced.

2094
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:12,360
We'll see.

2095
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:15,840
Dark Tetsuya says, I mean, I'll just be happy to get the Phantom Liberty update.

2096
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,720
Quest Buster says, Can't wait for Phantom Liberty.

2097
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,080
S2 100 Matt says, Here comes the Where are the new games?

2098
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,480
Worst Gamescom ever.

2099
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:28,360
Again, like you have Baldur's Gate three nerds.

2100
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:30,160
What else do you fucking want this year?

2101
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:34,400
Like go like literally on top of everything else.

2102
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:37,240
Everything else you've been given this year.

2103
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:39,720
You now have Baldur's Gate three.

2104
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,880
Go fucking play something that already came out.

2105
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:44,720
I mean, Starfield's coming out in a few weeks.

2106
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,160
I know the early access is happening on the Dragon Con,

2107
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:51,080
which I'm not paying for early access, but it's weird to me to think

2108
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:54,880
when I get back from Dragon Con, which I leave for in 10 days, BT dubs,

2109
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,760
when I get back from Dragon Con, there will be Starfield to play.

2110
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:01,880
For real, finally, it's amazing.

2111
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,760
Anyway, let's travel around the world

2112
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:08,280
and check out some games that are coming out

2113
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:11,640
a little sooner than October 20th as in the next week.

2114
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,640

01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:35,240
Now's the time to cash in on, you know, the Smurfs license.

2120
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:38,800
Well, after any movies or anything has been never done

2121
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:42,280

01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,840

2131
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:20,360
Ride five on PC, PlayStation five and Xbox series.

2132
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:25,760

2133
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,320
PlayStation four, PlayStation five, Xbox one and Xbox series.

2134
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:33,080
All right. Traveling over to Japan and looking at some releases there,

2135
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,040
you know, we had a pretty quiet week last week

2136
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,720
and in contrast, we have a very busy week this week.

2137
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,720
So coming out on the switch this week, on the 24th, we have DC

2138
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:45,840
three to Capo three plus story in regular and limited edition.

2139
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:49,880
Shirogane Cross Spirits, also in regular and limited edition.

2140
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:54,600
Caru Maruka Circle in regular and limited edition.

2141
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:57,960
Killer Frequency in a multi language

2142
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:00,480
supported edition comes out in Japan this week.

2143
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:05,360
We have the Kemco RPG Selection volume four releases for the switch.

2144
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:09,960
These come out pretty regularly with some, you know, more obscure

2145
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:12,640
to the audiences over here anyway, releases.

2146
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:16,200
But if you're curious, the releases in this collection are Cronus

2147
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:21,840
Ark, Bonds of the Skies, Legends of the Tetrarchs and Monochrome Order.

2148
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:25,160
So those are what are in the Kemco RPG Selection four.

2149
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:29,640
Coffee Talk one and two gets a double pack release as well.

2150
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:35,360
Tiny Troopers Global Ops, excuse me, and Unreal Life in a regular

2151
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,320
and limited edition also comes out.

2152
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,000
That's all on the Nintendo Switch.

2153
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,400
If you want to go over to the PlayStation five, you can check out

2154
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:48,600
Immortals of Avium is out as well as that Killer Frequency game is out as well.

2155
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:51,600
Ride five is also out in Japan.

2156
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:57,440
Tiny Troopers Global Ops and Fantavision 2020X

2157
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:00,320
is out as well in Japan this week.

2158
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,440
That's I'm assuming the VR game.

2159
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:07,000
I didn't realize Japan did not get it at the same time as the rest of us.

2160
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,560
But there you go. That is coming out.

2161
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:11,640
It's actually really low price, too.

2162
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,640
It's about a twenty dollar game in Japan.

2163
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:17,320
So it seems kind of low, but cool.

2164
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,360
So check that out.

2165
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:23,080
Me, it doesn't say anything about it being a price reduction, but

2166
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:26,560
interesting. All right.

2167
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

2168
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,040
A handful of things on PlayStation 20,

2169
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,960
but on the 22nd on PlayStation, we have Smurfs Kart

2170
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,480
for PlayStation, Xbox.

2171
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,880
We have Immortals of Avium on the 24th.

2172
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,240
Oh, it's a card game.

2173
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:46,960
Never mind. It's just Yu-Gi-Oh block set.

2174
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,720
Twenty fourth.

2175
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:52,360
We have PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Blasphemous two

2176
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,880
on PlayStation, Xbox, Ride five

2177
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:58,360
on the twenty fifth.

2178
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:02,560
We have Hitman World of Assassination on PlayStation

2179
01:57:03,680 --> 01:57:06,080
PlayStation, also Metal Tails Overkill

2180
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,360
PlayStation and Switch Armored Core six

2181
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:14,400
and on Switch Loop Hero.

2182
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,600
All right. Well, we have some more news stories for you.

2183
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:21,240
But before we get to those, DarkSakura, I believe at this point,

2184
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:23,400
you are going to be bidding us adieu tonight.

2185
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,000
You talked about some of your professional engagements earlier in the show.

2186
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
So I think you are heading out early tonight. Yeah, I got to.

2187
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,200
You know, it's it's work.

2188
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:36,560
I have to be up at five in the morning and I got some stuff to do before bed.

2189
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,040
So. All right.

2190
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:40,280
Hey, it's money pays the bills.

2191
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,920
But keep your eyes open in the meantime.

2192
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:46,680
Peace and love.

2193
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:49,280
All right. And no, no stream tonight, but we will look forward

2194
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:52,800
to seeing you back here next week, right here on Tuesday for streaming.

2195
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:54,720
Yeah, then I'll be, of course back.

2196
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,520
Yes. All right. Have a good one.

2197
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,760
I do. All right.

2198
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:00,320
Let's move on with the news.

2199
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,520
Loki, what do you have for us next?

2200
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:08,400
All right. So we talked about this before, that there was some sort of deal

2201
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:12,040
that fell through with Embracer Group, basically a two billion dollar deal.

2202
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:13,560
Very large.

2203
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:17,040
The initial assumption was, oh, this must be Sony or Microsoft

2204
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,400
investing in the company will come to find out.

2205
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:23,680
According to four anonymous sources that spoke with Axios,

2206
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:27,320
it's actually this Saudi public investment fund gaming

2207
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:31,320
subsidiary of Savvy Games Group that backed out.

2208
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,800
So. I mean.

2209
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:39,360
There's a whole like conflict with me, like with the Saudis

2210
01:58:39,880 --> 01:58:43,440
investing in gaming anyways, because of the whole, you know, way they

2211
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,200
you know, at least their government is treating like journalists,

2212
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,160
you know, murdering them,

2213
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:52,360
probably not favorable and, you know, kind of like,

2214
01:58:53,120 --> 01:58:57,000
oh, hey, let's invest in these games and stuff to make our image look better.

2215
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,800
Like, you know, I, I don't like the way that looks.

2216
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,400
So maybe that's why it fell through. Who knows?

2217
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:07,800
But, you know, they've already received one billion dollar investment

2218
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:12,840
from this investment fund, apparently already from last year.

2219
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:16,920
So they're just not receiving an additional two billion dollars.

2220
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:21,800
All right. Yeah, I am.

2221
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,440
This news is interesting about who left him at the altar.

2222
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,080
But yeah, I can't say I disagree, Loki, that maybe

2223
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,960
some of these countries are already a little too invested in gaming.

2224
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,080
I can't say I'm

2225
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:37,800
disappointed to hear that they're not going to have their,

2226
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,920
you know, be wedged in a little more.

2227
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:45,920
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says the idea of them investing in other things

2228
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:50,120
is part of part the image and part trying to not have all of their money

2229
01:59:50,120 --> 01:59:53,640
invested in oil in a world that's trying to get away from oil.

2230
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,720
It's both. Yeah.

2231
01:59:55,720 --> 01:59:58,480
But obviously there's still some human rights issues

2232
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:00,760
and so forth that are of a concern.

2233
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:06,520
So I can't say I'm, again, sad to see them not investing.

2234
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:09,440
But I know the industry, you know, and what embrace is going through

2235
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,320
is a shitty thing to do to embrace her.

2236
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:13,480
So I'm kind of curious what all happened there.

2237
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:15,000
Maybe they'll make a movie about it someday.

2238
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,200
Who knows? Maybe. Maybe.

2239
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:18,760
What else do you have, Loki?

2240
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:22,560
So kind of counter to what we're a little bit more in line

2241
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:24,280
with what we expect from Take-Two normally.

2242
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:27,640
We talked last week about how some of the roleplay mods and stuff

2243
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:32,120
have been brought into and purchased by Take-Two Interactive

2244
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:36,200
to kind of help support Grand Theft Auto online.

2245
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:41,280
Well, now they're just back to the usual game of striking down modders,

2246
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,000
creating mods for Grand Theft Auto five.

2247
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,760
So this one in particular is actually an AI mod

2248
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,600
using Eleven Labs voice technology as well.

2249
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:56,240
It allows, I guess, for more custom AI.

2250
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:00,200
I don't know if it's NPCs or other players, but,

2251
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:05,680
you know, basically a sentient street mods, which they said

2252
02:01:06,280 --> 02:01:10,920
had a story that revolved around AI worshipping death cult and NPCs

2253
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:14,800
whose dialogue would be randomly generated by a tool called

2254
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,640
in world character engine.

2255
02:01:16,640 --> 02:01:19,520
I mean, it sounds really cool,

2256
02:01:20,360 --> 02:01:24,040
but it's also not unexpected that Rockstar Games would do this.

2257
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,960
You know, hey, innovation, we can't have that.

2258
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:29,560
Let's just strike that down because you're using our game.

2259
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:32,200
Yeah. Well, also just make your own game.

2260
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,080
How is this? You know, how is it?

2261
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,560
And we've talked a little bit before about this when it comes to AI.

2262
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,280
How is the AI learning?

2263
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:39,840
You know, because if it's learning from something,

2264
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,040
right, given permission to use, then, well,

2265
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,960
it's probably learning from just the language models that they already have.

2266
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:46,840
So it's it.

2267
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:48,960
I don't think it's learning necessarily from this.

2268
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,800
It's probably not incorporating anything from Grand Theft Auto

2269
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:53,960
into how the language is generated, though.

2270
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,480
No, I don't think so. Hmm.

2271
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:59,560
Interesting. All right.

2272
02:01:59,560 --> 02:02:02,800
Well, something kind of lastly here tonight

2273
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:06,840
before we get to our listener roundtable, something that is a little

2274
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:10,440
again, it's one of those things that they probably don't have permission to do it.

2275
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:13,560
But I'm not I'm not so sure they're going to get shut down for this.

2276
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:16,400
This is a Twin Peaks.

2277
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:18,720
You know, I love this show, by the way.

2278
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:21,440
If you've never seen this show, it's an incredible TV show.

2279
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:23,880
It's a little bit dated. It's from the 90s.

2280
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:27,560
But Twin Peaks was a show that premiered in 1990.

2281
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:30,480
If you've ever heard the whole famous like Who Killed Laura Palmer thing,

2282
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:33,040
that is all from the show Twin Peaks.

2283
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:38,680
And this group, the Blue Rose team, it is a French developer,

2284
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:45,280
just released a demo this week for something called Twin Peaks into the night.

2285
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:49,160
They've been prepping this for a little bit now, and a demo just came out.

2286
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:52,640
And you can see here from the video that we're looking at on Twitch TV,

2287
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:55,320
or if you go look that up here because you're listening on the podcast,

2288
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:59,840
the graphics are very retro and they're very PlayStation one,

2289
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:02,080
which, you know, makes sense for the time frame of the game.

2290
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:05,240
Although actually in 1990, it would have been like Super Nintendo,

2291
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:07,440
like maybe a 32 X game.

2292
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:10,520
But that's OK, because, you know, the movie then came later and all that stuff.

2293
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:14,680
But I love the look of this for, you know, what this is.

2294
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:18,120
I love how they've recreated some of the imagery

2295
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:22,280
from the iconic TV show into this whole thing here.

2296
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:27,840
In the game, the game kind of looks like a little bit of a game

2297
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:29,160
in the game.

2298
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:32,320
Yeah, the game kind of has like this Resident Evil sort of look to it

2299
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:33,240
that looks really good.

2300
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,280
It kind of fits right in with that whole thing.

2301
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,160
Oh, God, I love this whole thing of that whole scene of

2302
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,760
Julie Cruz singing at the bar. But anyway,

2303
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:47,240
there looks to be some actual video cut scenes from the show itself.

2304
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:53,120
The demo has to do with events from season one where Cooper arrives in Twin Peaks

2305
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:56,840
and starts looking into the murder case of Laura Palmer.

2306
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,360
And of course, the demo has all the quirky things

2307
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,200
and the scary things that people loved from the TV show.

2308
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,880
The game, of course, will be free when it launches,

2309
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:08,280
because they're trying to avoid any legal issues.

2310
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:13,120
David Lynch, they're just kind of hoping is too busy doing his,

2311
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:18,120
you know, it's Friday social media posts and whatever weather reports

2312
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:20,040
he does on YouTube or whatever he's doing these days.

2313
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:22,840
So hopefully he won't cause a stink.

2314
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,320
ABC, which is technically Disney,

2315
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,640
don't know how they're going to take to this,

2316
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:32,240
but let's just kind of hope it kind of goes under their radar, shall we say?

2317
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:35,760
Anyway, I think this thing looks so cool, I got to say.

2318
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:42,200
It does not get into the elements of the recent Twin Peaks,

2319
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:45,960
The Return, which was on Showtime a few years ago,

2320
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:49,240
which was the, quote unquote, third season, which was also very good.

2321
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:52,160
But this game touches none of that.

2322
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:54,560
I suppose they have to save something for a potential sequel, right?

2323
02:04:55,240 --> 02:04:57,800
Who knows? Anyway.

2324
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:04,160
That is it for all the stories that we had slotted tonight.

2325
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,800
Comments in chat, Sjo and Hunter Matt says,

2326
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:08,920
So Rob is streaming this when?

2327
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:10,040
I'm tempted to.

2328
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,040
Let's let them give it a little more polish

2329
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:14,280
and then I'll probably have to stream it,

2330
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:16,360
because they only have the demo right now.

2331
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:19,880
So I would like to see maybe a full game if they if they even get there.

2332
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:22,280
But maybe I could do the demo. We'll see.

2333
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:24,640
Tiger class says a Twin Peaks video game could work

2334
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:27,440
because of all the detective type things you could do to find clues and such.

2335
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:30,600
It is interesting. We never got anything like that.

2336
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:33,520
But again, the TV show is from like 1990.

2337
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,680
So even though you're seeing it in a PlayStation one era game,

2338
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:42,240
which would be like 96, it's it's still a little dated.

2339
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:45,400
Bobby says you could play the demo and describe the references

2340
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,120
for people who'd ever watched the TV show.

2341
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:49,600
Well, maybe that would be a fun little VOG Network video at some point.

2342
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,440
We'll see. Who knows?

2343
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:54,640
So dark to see, it says someone got a C and D

2344
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:58,160
copyright thing for streaming a 25 year old soap opera.

2345
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:00,680
You can't even buy on DVD legally anymore.

2346
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:02,560
So you never know. That's that's true.

2347
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:05,080
You never know what they're going to police and what they're not.

2348
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:07,040
Let's go to you all.

2349
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,920
If you have any questions in our chat room for us, we're happy to happy.

2350
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:13,360
Happy to answer those over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

2351
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:17,360
The phone lines are open as well over on our Discord server, VOG Network

2352
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:18,960
dot com slash discord.

2353
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:21,520
And this is the part of the show where we would open up our mailbag.

2354
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:25,080
Participate at Orange Laundry dot com is the place to email us.

2355
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:27,840
If you have a question or thoughts as you listen throughout the week,

2356
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:31,760
especially those of you that are only listening through the podcast

2357
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,440
and aren't able to join us live on Sunday nights for whatever reason,

2358
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:35,840
totally understand that.

2359
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:37,000
Send us an email sometime.

2360
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,280
Participate at Orange Laundry dot com.

2361
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:40,920
Dark Soccer has already left the building,

2362
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:43,840
so I will be taking her role tonight and reading the emails.

2363
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:47,360
But my job is very, very easy as there were no emails in the bag tonight.

2364
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:50,960
So I hope we can get some next week over at participate at Orange

2365
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:55,360
Lounge Radio dot com while we wait to see if there's any questions

2366
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:57,600
or other roundtable topics for us.

2367
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,640
Loki, I don't know if there's any last minute news tonight

2368
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:01,320
or last minute stories, but I'll check.

2369
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:02,400
No, not a thing.

2370
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,440
I think so. I think so.

2371
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,840
It's been I feel like it actually has been a little bit.

2372
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:08,840
I mean, we've had some big stories we've talked about,

2373
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:11,920
but I feel like otherwise it's a little bit slower paced than usual.

2374
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:14,960
And then I remembered, oh, games comes next week.

2375
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:18,640
So some folks are holding, even though Jeff Keighley is saying,

2376
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:23,080
don't watch the expectation level, manage them expectations.

2377
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,560
That doesn't mean we won't get a few big things out of it.

2378
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:29,280
I'm hoping we get some updates from Konami on the Silent Hill

2379
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:31,600
stuff that they showed earlier this year.

2380
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:32,760
Like there's a lot.

2381
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:37,760
What their Silent Hill F, Silent Hill 2 remake, Silent Hill Ascension.

2382
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:39,600
There's all these Silent Hill things they announced

2383
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,600
and we don't have a release date for anything yet.

2384
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:44,120
So I'm hoping we find out that maybe one of those projects

2385
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:45,800
is coming out this year.

2386
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,880
Fun random aside.

2387
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:51,520
You know, we love our Dead by Daylight here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2388
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:55,560
Silent Hill kind of got their cosmetics refreshed

2389
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:59,720
and technically a new character from Silent Hill is now in the game.

2390
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,040
It's a it's a skin replacement, basically.

2391
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:06,160
So kind of like how in Resident Evil, you can replace Leon

2392
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,720
with Chris or Carlos. Well.

2393
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:11,200
Cheryl, why did her name escape me from there?

2394
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:13,640
Cheryl, you could replace with a lot of different characters.

2395
02:08:13,640 --> 02:08:16,200
This is what you could do. Lisa Garland, you can do James.

2396
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,840
And now as of this week, you can be Maria.

2397
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,760
Maria was added to the game this week.

2398
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:25,320
So I thought that would be timed a little more with maybe some news

2399
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:27,520
on the Silent Hill 2 remake, but whatever.

2400
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:29,720
Maybe that's coming this week. I don't know.

2401
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:32,520
Maybe they had to do it this week because the alien contents come in soon.

2402
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,840
I don't know. So we'll see.

2403
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:36,720
Yeah, Dartusi and James.

2404
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:41,160
Yeah, Dartusi in chat says, I mean, our holiday is already stacked

2405
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:44,440
even without anything new potentially out of Gamescom. True.

2406
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,400
I mean, I thought maybe they would announce some stuff

2407
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:49,440
for like the first part of next year, maybe. But.

2408
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,600
It's too soon, and there's all those rumors

2409
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:55,240
that Nintendo is going to make a move in the early part of next year,

2410
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:57,560
so we'll see. We'll see.

2411
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:01,520
All right. Well, Loki, anything else you want to talk about

2412
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,720
before we head on out tonight?

2413
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,640
No, I don't really have anything else other than

2414
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:09,400
like I said, I'm going to be streaming this week, you know,

2415
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:12,800
try to get as much streaming as I can in there.

2416
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:15,560
So, you know, look for that if you want to see stuff.

2417
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,920
What's on the screen behind me right now is Ace Race.

2418
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,720
That's the one that's like Mario Kart.

2419
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:22,920
OK, it's a lot. It's a lot of fun to play.

2420
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:26,200
Like it really is. It's a movement so fast. Yeah.

2421
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:29,280
So, yeah, that'll be something cool.

2422
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:33,720
Hopefully they bring Ace Race to MCC Island soon because that's free

2423
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:36,160
and it's kind of cool with like if it is MCC,

2424
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:39,000
something you want to check out as you see islands completely free.

2425
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:43,000
There's you just search it online and you can play in a lot

2426
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:43,960
of the different games.

2427
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:46,560
They have twists on what's actually in MCC.

2428
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:49,280
It's actually harder in MCC Island.

2429
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:53,000
How hard would it be for a Minecraft noob or, you know,

2430
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:56,920
dirty casual like me to sign in and play one of these games?

2431
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:00,320
Well, for MCC Island, completely easy.

2432
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:03,240
You just set up your Minecraft client to connect to it.

2433
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:06,760
They even have like an installer or like a mod list

2434
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:09,240
that they'd recommend for like performance stuff.

2435
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:11,000
But you don't necessarily need to do that.

2436
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,880
Wow. It's just connecting to the server.

2437
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:17,600
And then you can play in a bunch of the different games that they have there.

2438
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:20,960
And you get like coins and stuff and you like skins and stuff

2439
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:22,440
that you can unlock. So it's pretty cool.

2440
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:26,240
Does Microsoft recognize any of this stuff with as big of a deal as it is,

2441
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:28,120
or is it really just community grown?

2442
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:30,040
This one's all community grown.

2443
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:31,800
So it's all independent.

2444
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,840
All right. Well, good luck to you.

2445
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:34,280
We'll be watching.

2446
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,000
Yeah, they're not going to recognize about some builds.

2447
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,520
They're definitely not going to recognize this.

2448
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:38,480
I mean, maybe they would.

2449
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:41,080
I mean, this is so to go back to MCC again.

2450
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:44,680
So MCC is literally something that the biggest,

2451
02:10:44,920 --> 02:10:48,760
absolute biggest content creators in the Minecraft space participate in.

2452
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:52,160
Dream, you have all the hermit, you know, a lot of the hermit craft people,

2453
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,920
a lot of the Empire's people.

2454
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:57,400
You have all of the people on the Dream S&P type stuff.

2455
02:10:58,080 --> 02:11:00,640
Technoblade one, you know, he was still with us.

2456
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:05,800
Lots and lots of content creators and millions of subscribers and stuff like

2457
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:09,440
that's the type of audience that normally are people that participate.

2458
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:13,400
So we've got some of them as trainers right now, which is cool.

2459
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,720
So I'm looking to get some time with them.

2460
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:20,080
We hung out with CPK not that long ago earlier this week,

2461
02:11:20,360 --> 02:11:24,680
but I haven't really been on the train server as much as I probably should.

2462
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:27,920
But this week, for sure, I'm going to get time in.

2463
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:30,400
S2100 Matt in chat says really happy for you, Loki.

2464
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,720
You've worked hard on your content and it's paying off now.

2465
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:35,560
Yeah, you know, I hope so. Yeah, no pressure.

2466
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:36,440
We'll all be watching.

2467
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:36,800
But you know what?

2468
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,200
Just like I said, have fun with it.

2469
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:39,480
Like, just go in. Yeah.

2470
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:40,480
Have fun with it.

2471
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,000
Make the connections.

2472
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,880
Win them over with humor.

2473
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:46,400
You know, you're going to you're going to be fine.

2474
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:47,840
We have a good group.

2475
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:50,600
We've got like Binnish is super energetic people.

2476
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:54,040
You know, they're funny and they're absolutely funny.

2477
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:56,760
And then, of course, Errington.

2478
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,960
You know, it's a good group of people.

2479
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:00,120
So I think we have good chemistry and I think it'll be a lot of fun.

2480
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:02,600
One other question I have to ask.

2481
02:12:02,600 --> 02:12:05,440
What does Mrs. Loki think of this?

2482
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:07,440
I just don't understand it.

2483
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,240
You know, Minecraft stuff.

2484
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:10,960
Yeah, OK, fair enough.

2485
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:14,480
All right. Before we roll credits tonight,

2486
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:17,080
I want to thank everybody for listening to orange on radio this week.

2487
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:18,640
Thank you so much.

2488
02:12:18,640 --> 02:12:20,320
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the program,

2489
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,680
tell a friend or two about the show.

2490
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:22,680
Help us spread the word.

2491
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:24,480
We are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2492
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:27,120
but we just need more voices in the room to put out on air.

2493
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:29,960
A nice five star review on a site like iTunes, Spotify

2494
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:31,760
or wherever it is you found this podcast.

2495
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:33,360
Those go an awful long way.

2496
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:34,960
So it's super appreciate that.

2497
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:37,320
Obviously, a lot of fun stuff coming up in the future

2498
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:40,200
with Loki's Minecraft Championship coming up this weekend.

2499
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:42,960
I've got Dragon Con coming up in just over 10 days.

2500
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:44,760
So very excited.

2501
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:47,000
I hope to meet some of you at Dragon Con again this year.

2502
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:47,640
It'll be a lot of fun.

2503
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:51,800
Unfortunately, the panels have still not been released to the app.

2504
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:54,560
I have a feeling

2505
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:58,080
just my gut tells me some of the contingency for SAG after strike.

2506
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:01,000
I think part of them really hopes they get it worked out this next week

2507
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:03,280
because I think some of them are returning to the table.

2508
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:06,840
So I feel like Dragon Con has like a plan A and a plan B,

2509
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,840
and they're waiting for which button to push that.

2510
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:09,840
I know I know nothing.

2511
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:11,240
That's just my speculation.

2512
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:14,520
But usually two weeks before the event, the app has gone live.

2513
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:15,920
So we'll we'll see.

2514
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,000
But anyway, I'm really excited about that.

2515
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,760
Really excited to be back here again in seven days with all of you.

2516
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:23,240
Let's get everybody's final thought before we wrap up for the night.

2517
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:25,160
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2518
02:13:25,160 --> 02:13:27,240
A big week.

2519
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:29,480
Yeah, my final thought.

2520
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:30,480
Big two weeks.

2521
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:32,160
So thank you, everybody.

2522
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,200
Thank you so much for being here.

2523
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:34,560
We'll see you again in seven days.

2524
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:36,120
Thanks so much for joining us tonight.

2525
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:38,400
Have a wonderful night, everybody. Bye bye.
